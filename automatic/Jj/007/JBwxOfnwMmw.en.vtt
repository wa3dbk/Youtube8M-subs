00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
van so I went to the fabric store found

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.290 
van so I went to the fabric store found
some<00:00:10.290> vinyl<00:00:10.650> that<00:00:10.769> matched<00:00:10.980> the<00:00:11.190> armrest<00:00:11.610> got

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
some vinyl that matched the armrest got

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.990 
some vinyl that matched the armrest got
some<00:00:12.509> silicone<00:00:12.960> caulking<00:00:13.259> and<00:00:13.559> some<00:00:14.400> 3m

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
some silicone caulking and some 3m

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.900 
some silicone caulking and some 3m
contact<00:00:15.750> adhesive<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.619> first<00:00:16.859> step<00:00:17.100> is<00:00:17.310> to

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
contact adhesive the first step is to

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.480 
contact adhesive the first step is to
fill<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.359> cracks<00:00:18.750> with<00:00:19.380> silicone<00:00:20.220> caulking

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
fill the cracks with silicone caulking

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.210 
fill the cracks with silicone caulking
so<00:00:20.880> you<00:00:21.060> see<00:00:21.330> I'm<00:00:21.420> using<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:21.960> clear<00:00:22.920> silicone

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
so you see I'm using a clear silicone

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.029 
so you see I'm using a clear silicone
caulking<00:00:23.670> but<00:00:23.939> it<00:00:24.029> starts<00:00:24.269> out<00:00:24.420> white<00:00:24.779> I<00:00:25.260> like

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
caulking but it starts out white I like

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.830 
caulking but it starts out white I like
this<00:00:26.250> because<00:00:26.490> I<00:00:26.730> can<00:00:26.760> see<00:00:27.119> when<00:00:27.300> it's<00:00:27.449> dry<00:00:27.660> and

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
this because I can see when it's dry and

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.689 
this because I can see when it's dry and
when<00:00:27.960> I<00:00:27.990> can<00:00:28.170> start<00:00:28.380> sanding<00:00:28.710> so<00:00:29.460> you<00:00:29.519> want<00:00:29.640> to

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
when I can start sanding so you want to

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.400 
when I can start sanding so you want to
use<00:00:29.789> a<00:00:29.820> putty<00:00:30.090> knife<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.330> work<00:00:30.599> it<00:00:30.779> down<00:00:30.810> all

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
use a putty knife to work it down all

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.709 
use a putty knife to work it down all
the<00:00:31.560> way<00:00:31.650> down<00:00:31.830> into<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.099> cracks<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:33.390> reason

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
the way down into the cracks the reason

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.209 
the way down into the cracks the reason
for<00:00:33.870> doing<00:00:33.960> this<00:00:34.110> is<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.410> keep<00:00:34.710> those<00:00:34.890> cracks

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
for doing this is to keep those cracks

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.280 
for doing this is to keep those cracks
from<00:00:35.399> transferring<00:00:36.090> now<00:00:36.600> you<00:00:36.660> need<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:36.989> sand

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
from transferring now you need to sand

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.590 
from transferring now you need to sand
off<00:00:37.469> all<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.829> edges<00:00:38.219> so<00:00:38.430> that<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.850> vinyl<00:00:39.270> is

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
off all the edges so that the vinyl is

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.069 
off all the edges so that the vinyl is
smooth<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.520> silicone<00:00:41.520> comes<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.090> top<00:00:42.270> you

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
smooth and silicone comes to the top you

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.750 
smooth and silicone comes to the top you
see<00:00:43.110> it's<00:00:43.410> not<00:00:43.590> quite<00:00:43.649> filled<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.340> top<00:00:44.460> so

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
see it's not quite filled to the top so

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.029 
see it's not quite filled to the top so
I'm<00:00:44.850> going<00:00:45.210> back<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:46.050> refilling<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.800> cracks

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
I'm going back and refilling the cracks

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.799 
I'm going back and refilling the cracks
with<00:00:47.250> silicone<00:00:47.700> using<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.090> putty<00:00:48.300> knife<00:00:48.539> to

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
with silicone using the putty knife to

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.950 
with silicone using the putty knife to
try<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:49.890> make<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.340> nice<00:00:50.850> smooth<00:00:51.270> surface<00:00:51.300> so

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
try and make a nice smooth surface so

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.619 
try and make a nice smooth surface so
that<00:00:51.989> those<00:00:52.260> cracks<00:00:52.559> don't<00:00:52.860> transfer<00:00:53.640> through

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
that those cracks don't transfer through

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.830 
that those cracks don't transfer through
the<00:00:55.199> new<00:00:55.379> vinyl<00:00:55.760> I'm<00:00:56.760> taking<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.449> piece<00:00:57.660> of

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
the new vinyl I'm taking a piece of

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.510 
the new vinyl I'm taking a piece of
vinyl<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.379> I'm<00:00:58.559> cutting<00:00:58.829> it<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.340> rough

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
vinyl and I'm cutting it to the rough

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.520 
vinyl and I'm cutting it to the rough
dimensions<00:00:59.879> that<00:01:00.359> I<00:01:00.390> want<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.750> use<00:01:00.899> for<00:01:01.109> the

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
dimensions that I want to use for the

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.060 
dimensions that I want to use for the
door<00:01:01.890> handle<00:01:02.250> or<00:01:03.290> armrests<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.470> now<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:04.920> need

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
door handle or armrests and now I need

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.260 
door handle or armrests and now I need
to<00:01:05.220> take<00:01:05.489> off<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:06.000> door<00:01:06.210> handle<00:01:06.240> this<00:01:06.810> takes<00:01:07.350> a

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
to take off the door handle this takes a

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:15.230 
to take off the door handle this takes a
star<00:01:09.270> 25<00:01:09.900> or<00:01:10.799> t25<00:01:11.869> star<00:01:12.890> ratchet<00:01:13.920> two<00:01:14.909> bolts

star 25 or t25 star ratchet two bolts

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.120 
star 25 or t25 star ratchet two bolts
and<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.659> handle<00:01:15.960> comes<00:01:16.140> right<00:01:16.350> off<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:17.040> this

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
and the handle comes right off and this

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.920 
and the handle comes right off and this
allow<00:01:17.549> me<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.790> wrap<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.180> vinyl<00:01:18.479> around<00:01:18.750> and

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
allow me to wrap the vinyl around and

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.200 
allow me to wrap the vinyl around and
hide<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.290> with<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.560> handle

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
hide it with the handle

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.350 
hide it with the handle
so<00:01:22.210> now<00:01:22.360> I'm<00:01:22.870> making<00:01:23.170> the<00:01:23.590> final<00:01:24.040> pattern<00:01:24.360> you

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
so now I'm making the final pattern you

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.640 
so now I'm making the final pattern you
got<00:01:25.510> to<00:01:25.600> make<00:01:25.720> sure<00:01:25.840> that<00:01:25.870> the<00:01:26.080> vinyls<00:01:26.410> tucked

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
got to make sure that the vinyls tucked

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.920 
got to make sure that the vinyls tucked
in<00:01:26.800> at<00:01:26.950> the<00:01:27.070> top<00:01:27.250> and<00:01:27.490> then<00:01:28.210> stretched<00:01:28.690> around

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
in at the top and then stretched around

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.020 
in at the top and then stretched around
to<00:01:29.380> the<00:01:29.680> bottom<00:01:30.040> where<00:01:30.220> you<00:01:30.250> want<00:01:30.520> it<00:01:30.640> to<00:01:30.850> go

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
to the bottom where you want it to go

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.390 
to the bottom where you want it to go
and<00:01:31.330> now<00:01:32.260> I'm<00:01:32.410> cutting<00:01:32.830> it<00:01:32.950> to<00:01:33.070> shape<00:01:33.310> and

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
and now I'm cutting it to shape and

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.010 
and now I'm cutting it to shape and
actually<00:01:36.400> cutting<00:01:36.610> just<00:01:36.910> a<00:01:37.120> little<00:01:37.540> bit<00:01:37.660> large

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
actually cutting just a little bit large

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.230 
actually cutting just a little bit large
because<00:01:38.710> I<00:01:38.830> want<00:01:38.979> to<00:01:39.010> make<00:01:39.160> sure<00:01:39.190> that<00:01:39.580> again<00:01:40.060> I

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
because I want to make sure that again I

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.260 
because I want to make sure that again I
reach<00:01:40.540> the<00:01:40.810> full<00:01:40.990> surface<00:01:41.470> and<00:01:41.710> sometimes

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
reach the full surface and sometimes

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.180 
reach the full surface and sometimes
it's<00:01:43.270> difficult<00:01:43.450> to<00:01:43.900> get<00:01:44.080> the<00:01:44.140> final<00:01:44.650> shape

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 
it's difficult to get the final shape

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:46.650 
it's difficult to get the final shape
and<00:01:45.430> size<00:01:45.610> while<00:01:45.970> you're<00:01:46.119> working<00:01:46.240> with<00:01:46.420> out

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:46.660 
and size while you're working with out

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.260 
and size while you're working with out
if<00:01:46.780> you<00:01:46.900> move<00:01:47.229> down<00:01:47.640> so<00:01:48.640> I'm<00:01:48.760> up<00:01:48.880> here<00:01:49.119> at<00:01:49.210> the

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
if you move down so I'm up here at the

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.730 
if you move down so I'm up here at the
top<00:01:49.479> what<00:01:49.720> I'm<00:01:49.840> doing<00:01:50.080> is<00:01:50.170> cutting<00:01:50.320> a<00:01:50.530> wedge

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
top what I'm doing is cutting a wedge

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.830 
top what I'm doing is cutting a wedge
out<00:01:51.010> because<00:01:51.369> the<00:01:51.610> fabric<00:01:52.330> has<00:01:52.479> to<00:01:52.510> wrap

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
out because the fabric has to wrap

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.260 
out because the fabric has to wrap
around<00:01:52.869> the<00:01:53.229> corner<00:01:53.680> and<00:01:53.890> I<00:01:54.700> want<00:01:54.940> to<00:01:55.000> make<00:01:55.090> it

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
around the corner and I want to make it

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.920 
around the corner and I want to make it
nice<00:01:56.040> even<00:01:57.040> seam<00:01:57.340> in<00:01:57.490> there<00:01:57.670> so<00:01:58.330> I<00:01:58.570> cut<00:01:58.780> the

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
nice even seam in there so I cut the

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.170 
nice even seam in there so I cut the
wedge<00:01:59.080> then<00:01:59.380> the<00:01:59.470> two<00:01:59.619> pieces<00:01:59.830> can<00:02:00.160> match<00:02:00.910> up

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
wedge then the two pieces can match up

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.670 
wedge then the two pieces can match up
then<00:02:01.479> I<00:02:01.570> cut<00:02:01.750> it<00:02:01.780> which<00:02:02.050> on<00:02:02.229> the<00:02:02.320> other<00:02:02.440> side

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
then I cut it which on the other side

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.219 
then I cut it which on the other side
now<00:02:03.550> finally<00:02:03.970> I'm<00:02:04.210> sanding<00:02:04.660> in<00:02:04.780> between<00:02:04.810> the

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
now finally I'm sanding in between the

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.380 
now finally I'm sanding in between the
cracks<00:02:05.440> to<00:02:05.860> make<00:02:06.580> sure<00:02:06.759> that<00:02:06.940> I<00:02:06.970> get<00:02:07.090> good

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
cracks to make sure that I get good

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.510 
cracks to make sure that I get good
adhesion<00:02:07.600> before<00:02:08.410> from<00:02:08.800> the<00:02:08.890> Smith<00:02:09.160> because<00:02:09.489> I

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
adhesion before from the Smith because I

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.900 
adhesion before from the Smith because I
wasn't<00:02:09.820> sure<00:02:10.090> how<00:02:10.119> well<00:02:10.570> I<00:02:10.600> would<00:02:10.869> adhere<00:02:10.989> to

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
wasn't sure how well I would adhere to

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.150 
wasn't sure how well I would adhere to
the<00:02:12.910> silicon<00:02:13.690> so<00:02:14.020> I<00:02:14.050> wanted<00:02:14.410> to<00:02:14.470> remove<00:02:15.010> the

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
the silicon so I wanted to remove the

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.430 
the silicon so I wanted to remove the
silicon<00:02:15.550> in<00:02:15.670> between<00:02:15.970> those<00:02:16.120> cracks<00:02:16.360> and<00:02:16.660> then

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
silicon in between those cracks and then

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.430 
silicon in between those cracks and then
I<00:02:17.470> need<00:02:17.680> to<00:02:17.830> mask<00:02:18.070> the<00:02:18.430> door<00:02:18.670> off<00:02:19.170> this<00:02:20.170> will

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
I need to mask the door off this will

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.220 
I need to mask the door off this will
prevent<00:02:21.220> me<00:02:21.550> from<00:02:21.610> getting<00:02:22.060> the<00:02:22.570> spray

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230

fit then before finishing the bottom and
go<00:03:15.810> ahead<00:03:16.019> and<00:03:16.200> cut<00:03:16.590> it<00:03:16.620> to<00:03:16.980> size<00:03:17.810> now<00:03:18.810> that<00:03:18.989> I

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
go ahead and cut it to size now that I

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.660 
go ahead and cut it to size now that I
have<00:03:19.260> it<00:03:19.380> adhered<00:03:19.739> I<00:03:19.860> can<00:03:20.040> really<00:03:20.310> get<00:03:20.489> it

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.660 
to get it right luckily it wraps around
the<00:03:39.269> top<00:03:39.569> so<00:03:40.410> I<00:03:40.440> took<00:03:40.920> the<00:03:41.069> vinyl<00:03:41.370> and<00:03:41.400> wrapped

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
the top so I took the vinyl and wrapped

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.030 
the top so I took the vinyl and wrapped
it<00:03:41.850> around<00:03:41.910> so<00:03:42.330> that<00:03:42.360> the<00:03:42.660> seam<00:03:42.900> would<00:03:43.110> be<00:03:43.769> down

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
it around so that the seam would be down

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.509 
it around so that the seam would be down
below<00:03:44.519> and<00:03:44.819> be<00:03:45.600> hit<00:03:45.780> by<00:03:45.989> the<00:03:46.049> door<00:03:46.350> and<00:03:46.680> I'm

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
below and be hit by the door and I'm

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.699 
below and be hit by the door and I'm
just<00:03:47.760> cutting<00:03:48.030> it<00:03:48.239> so<00:03:48.420> that<00:03:48.570> the<00:03:48.690> two<00:03:48.900> pieces

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
just cutting it so that the two pieces

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.340 
just cutting it so that the two pieces
match<00:03:50.070> up<00:03:50.310> and<00:03:50.640> I<00:03:51.090> can<00:03:51.540> hopefully<00:03:51.810> get<00:03:52.049> a<00:03:52.110> nice

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
match up and I can hopefully get a nice

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.030 
match up and I can hopefully get a nice
bit<00:03:52.680> take<00:03:53.549> the<00:03:53.700> masking<00:03:54.209> tape<00:03:54.470> and<00:03:55.470> paper<00:03:55.739> off
