00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.430
 hello there again polyakov anton 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:17.470
 and this is 8 adobe photoshop tutorial 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:19.930
 originally when i created this course i 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.390
 he was positioned not only for those 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.760
 people who are engaged in site building 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.590
 but for those people who need this 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:30.100
 home program 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:33.489
 and today it is a practical lesson 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:35.319
 for those people who need this 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:37.620
 program for home use or 

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:41.620
 they just somewhere photo salon 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:45.399
 do photography just this lesson 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:49.479
 not really needed for site building 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:51.039
 but I think to people who are engaged in 

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:54.429
 this industry would also do well 

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:59.609
 watch this lesson and so the lesson will be 

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:59.609
 dedicated to black and white photography exactly 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:05.360
 creating very quality black and white 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:07.340
 The picture is currently very popular 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.890
 started posting your photos in 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:15.040
 black and white in various social 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:19.580
 networks and usually these are 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:24.090
 photos of poor quality by studying 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:26.320
 on the internet I looked very little 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.540
 information on how to do exactly 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.420
 quality photo in black and white 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.440
 the color is usually all worth it 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.380
 the photo 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:38.729
 given in black and white and on this 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.729
 the lesson is over but 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.780
 This still unfinished photo this 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:48.070
 gray spot if you will print it 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.070
 on the printer, so let's start 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:54.760
 open the photo let's be 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.360
 think about what this photo will be 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:00.540
 Immediately we will print and so 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:04.260
 change image size 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:07.660
 let's take somewhere 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:12.180
 10 permission can be left in principle 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.180
 it suits us for the printer 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:20.580
 so now bring it in black and white 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.910
 option push image mode 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.910
 graces of gray 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:30.920
 So basically, many lessons for this are not 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:34.040
 ends but we need to do so 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:38.569
 so we have a more saturated white 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:41.780
 color and black color are now starting 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:47.030
 gradually lighten body image 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:49.220
 correction and curves here we take we clamp 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.829
 left mouse button and look at 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:57.470
 our image to make it lighter 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:03:00.889
 It has become a little so now we saturate our 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:03.520
 the image in black and white go to 

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:06.500
 image correction and level 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.910
 venti in these levels it shows that 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:12.080
 in this photo 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:15.950
 white almost no one here 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:19.150
 gray color we take this one 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:24.320
 and move it to this diagonal 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:27.080
 so that on this graph we have where he stood 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.270
 saturated already have a white color also 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:32.870
 We look that person on photos of India 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:35.090
 shine white spots so on 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.310
 look at the black light but see with us 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.460
 black, too, in principle, very little 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.440
 take this area of ​​photography 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:45.320
 there is some such incomprehensible gray 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.080
 color though there is a shadow we take this box and 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:51.040
 move 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:53.140
 here here we immediately saw that we 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:57.150
 darkened eyes became more distinct 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.150
 beautiful click ok 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:03.490
 basically processing is finished but i 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:07.460
 I prefer to add another filter 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:10.840
 that when printing the contours of the photos were 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:14.920
 clearer and so we go filter 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:20.269
 sharpness sharpness 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:23.769
 here I usually have me here with me 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.769
 I usually put 300 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:34.860
 radius 1 out of 115 click ok and now 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:38.030
 if you look closer then the contours of steel 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.030
 much clearer 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.840
 photo processing in principle 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.470
 rafi and finished and now i want 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.470
 to show you 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.560
 difference in two photos in one 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:56.880
 photos where we processed the photo 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:59.550
 and gave it more normal screws in 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.410
 that photo where we just translate 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:06.319
 her in black and white version so let's 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:06.319
 save the photo here 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:15.120
 let's open it 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:19.470
 color photo and give the day 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:22.009
 black and white so we can 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.009
 to remove 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:32.410
 I think the difference is visible 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:38.600
 that is, here we have a really gray spot 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:43.090
 here we already have a beautiful photo 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:43.090
 where eyes are very well pronounced 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:50.640
 and the face becomes more at the front 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:50.640
 the plan stands out and looks 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:57.220
 our lesson is over 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:06:02.340
 I hope you apply this knowledge to 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:02.340
 see you in the next lesson
