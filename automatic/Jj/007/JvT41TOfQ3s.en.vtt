the<00:00:32.489> VHP<00:00:32.910> runs<00:00:33.270> itself<00:00:36.500> this<00:00:37.500> bolt<00:00:38.100> is<00:00:38.340> able<00:00:38.870> to

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
the VHP runs itself this bolt is able to

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.860 
the VHP runs itself this bolt is able to
run<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.170> few<00:00:40.320> hundred<00:00:40.969> so<00:00:41.969> you<00:00:42.030> can<00:00:42.300> run<00:00:42.540> for

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
run a few hundred so you can run for

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.529 
run a few hundred so you can run for
example<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.469> get<00:00:43.829> my<00:00:43.950> color<00:00:44.190> emulator<00:00:44.670> you

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
example and get my color emulator you

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.110 
example and get my color emulator you
can<00:00:45.750> run<00:00:45.989> PS<00:00:46.289> power<00:00:46.530> so<00:00:46.950> you<00:00:46.980> can<00:00:47.100> rename<00:00:47.850> and

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
can run PS power so you can rename and

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.130 
can run PS power so you can rename and
move<00:00:48.270> some<00:00:48.690> files<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:50.090> it's<00:00:51.090> also<00:00:51.510> possible

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
move some files and it's also possible

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.900 
move some files and it's also possible
to<00:00:52.910> run<00:00:53.910> book<00:00:54.360> are<00:00:54.570> so<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.050> can<00:00:55.350> run<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:56.100> few

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
to run book are so you can run a few

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.099 
to run book are so you can run a few
smaller<00:00:58.670> basically<00:00:59.670> ebooks<00:01:00.059> or<00:01:00.329> PDF<00:01:00.809> files

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
smaller basically ebooks or PDF files

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.369 
smaller basically ebooks or PDF files
and<00:01:01.379> so<00:01:01.559> on<00:01:01.789> we<00:01:02.789> still<00:01:03.210> got<00:01:03.449> these<00:01:03.629> errors<00:01:04.019> in

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
and so on we still got these errors in

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.060 
and so on we still got these errors in

like<00:02:10.030> this<00:02:10.239> old-school<00:02:10.659> game<00:02:11.019> tetris<00:02:14.099> and<00:02:17.250> it

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
like this old-school game tetris and it

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:45.840 
like this old-school game tetris and it
should<00:02:18.549> work<00:02:18.579> without<00:02:19.120> rum<00:02:28.139> rum<00:02:29.310> crystal
