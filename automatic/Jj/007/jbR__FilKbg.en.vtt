checked<00:00:17.789> her<00:00:17.940> out<00:00:18.000> and<00:00:18.390> thought<00:00:18.840> it'd<00:00:18.990> be<00:00:19.020> a

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
checked her out and thought it'd be a

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.300 
checked her out and thought it'd be a
good<00:00:19.230> idea<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:19.619> get<00:00:19.830> her<00:00:19.920> in<00:00:20.039> for<00:00:20.189> some

radiographs<00:00:20.670> and<00:00:21.270> we<00:00:22.020> did<00:00:22.170> that<00:00:22.350> and<00:00:22.500> we

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
radiographs and we did that and we

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.109 
radiographs and we did that and we
noticed<00:00:22.949> that<00:00:23.100> something<00:00:23.400> wasn't<00:00:23.550> right<00:00:23.850> and

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
noticed that something wasn't right and

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.589 
noticed that something wasn't right and
we<00:00:24.359> decided<00:00:25.080> to<00:00:25.320> make<00:00:25.920> all<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.279> calls<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:27.090> get

young bear we have to be careful about

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.030 
young bear we have to be careful about
how<00:00:41.489> we<00:00:41.520> handle<00:00:42.120> these<00:00:42.270> sorts<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:42.870> large<00:00:43.290> wild

how we handle these sorts of large wild

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.270 
how we handle these sorts of large wild
creatures<00:00:44.520> so<00:00:45.300> when<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.320> ona<00:00:46.469> arrived<00:00:46.829> we

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
creatures so when the ona arrived we

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.520 
creatures so when the ona arrived we
needed<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.760> give<00:00:48.390> her<00:00:48.510> drugs<00:00:48.690> so<00:00:49.170> that<00:00:49.350> she

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
needed to give her drugs so that she

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.680 
needed to give her drugs so that she
would<00:00:49.680> be<00:00:49.800> handleable<00:00:50.280> that's<00:00:51.059> sometimes<00:00:51.360> a

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
would be handleable that's sometimes a

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.569 
would be handleable that's sometimes a
challenge<00:00:51.930> getting<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.680> creighton<00:00:53.070> position

challenge getting the creighton position

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.240 
challenge getting the creighton position
we<00:00:54.000> used<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.329> very<00:00:54.510> special<00:00:54.989> anesthetic<00:00:55.559> peanut

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
we used a very special anesthetic peanut

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.369 
we used a very special anesthetic peanut
butter<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.789> draw<00:00:57.149> her<00:00:57.329> attention<00:00:57.360> so<00:00:58.079> we<00:00:58.199> could

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
butter to draw her attention so we could

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.830 
butter to draw her attention so we could
make<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.739> injection<00:00:59.309> once<00:01:00.270> we<00:01:00.449> have<00:01:00.480> our<00:01:00.629> on

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
make the injection once we have our on

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.319 
make the injection once we have our on
the<00:01:00.960> table<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.500> intubated<00:01:02.190> then<00:01:02.969> we're<00:01:03.180> able

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
the table and intubated then we're able

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.600 
the table and intubated then we're able
to<00:01:03.629> proceed<00:01:04.140> pretty<00:01:04.589> much<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.070> same<00:01:05.250> way<00:01:05.430> we

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
to proceed pretty much the same way we

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.210 
to proceed pretty much the same way we
would<00:01:05.640> with<00:01:06.030> any<00:01:06.210> other<00:01:06.299> anime<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.590> cat<00:01:07.979> scan

that Jana has we were seeing Jana today
because<00:01:17.670> of<00:01:17.700> our<00:01:18.360> problem<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:19.380> she<00:01:19.650> has<00:01:19.860> with

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
because of our problem that she has with

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.719 
because of our problem that she has with
our<00:01:20.630> front<00:01:21.630> leg<00:01:21.900> on<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.290> right<00:01:22.530> side<00:01:22.830> she<00:01:23.460> had

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.130 
also to have an immediate assessment
kind<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.470> a<00:01:55.590> 3d<00:01:56.490> assessment<00:01:57.090> of<00:01:57.270> things<00:01:57.570> we<00:01:57.990> can

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
kind of a 3d assessment of things we can

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.789 
kind of a 3d assessment of things we can
see<00:01:58.409> fragments<00:01:59.180> on<00:02:00.180> cross<00:02:00.600> sections<00:02:01.079> but<00:02:01.530> we

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
see fragments on cross sections but we

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.800 
see fragments on cross sections but we
see<00:02:02.040> them<00:02:02.219> a<00:02:02.310> lot<00:02:02.430> better<00:02:02.579> in<00:02:02.820> 3d<00:02:03.000> view<00:02:03.479> so<00:02:03.780> we

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
see them a lot better in 3d view so we

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.719 
see them a lot better in 3d view so we
can<00:02:04.049> see<00:02:04.229> where<00:02:04.469> they<00:02:04.649> are<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:05.130> so<00:02:05.310> our

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
can see where they are and so our

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.180 
can see where they are and so our
initial<00:02:05.880> assessment<00:02:06.689> allowed<00:02:06.930> us<00:02:07.110> to<00:02:07.140> kind<00:02:08.099> of

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
initial assessment allowed us to kind of

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.880 
initial assessment allowed us to kind of
detect<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.789> presence<00:02:08.940> of<00:02:09.300> that<00:02:09.509> fragment<00:02:10.440> and

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
detect the presence of that fragment and

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.250 
detect the presence of that fragment and
look<00:02:11.340> at<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.550> general

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
look at the general

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.199 
look at the general
shape<00:02:12.560> of<00:02:12.739> the<00:02:12.860> bone<00:02:13.069> the<00:02:13.459> general<00:02:13.819> feat<00:02:14.060> of

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
shape of the bone the general feat of

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:15.729 
shape of the bone the general feat of
the<00:02:14.299> elbow<00:02:14.599> joint<00:02:14.900> that's<00:02:15.230> that's<00:02:15.650> very

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
the elbow joint that's that's very

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.429 
the elbow joint that's that's very
helpful<00:02:16.239> but<00:02:17.239> one<00:02:17.390> of<00:02:17.510> the<00:02:17.599> important<00:02:18.170> things

00:02:18.429 --> 00:02:18.439 
helpful but one of the important things

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:20.589 
helpful but one of the important things
that<00:02:18.829> students<00:02:19.670> need<00:02:19.879> to<00:02:19.939> learn<00:02:20.090> when<00:02:20.480> they're

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 
that students need to learn when they're

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:22.240 
that students need to learn when they're
in<00:02:20.720> veterinary<00:02:21.140> school<00:02:21.409> is<00:02:21.620> how<00:02:21.739> to<00:02:21.799> work<00:02:22.040> with

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
in veterinary school is how to work with

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.100 
in veterinary school is how to work with
these<00:02:22.400> unusual<00:02:23.000> animals<00:02:23.420> so<00:02:23.689> every

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
these unusual animals so every

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.470 
these unusual animals so every
opportunity<00:02:24.409> we<00:02:24.799> have<00:02:25.189> to<00:02:25.939> look<00:02:26.090> at<00:02:26.209> animals

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
opportunity we have to look at animals

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.300 
opportunity we have to look at animals
that<00:02:26.810> are<00:02:26.930> beyond<00:02:27.650> what<00:02:27.890> you<00:02:28.010> would<00:02:28.129> normally

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
that are beyond what you would normally
