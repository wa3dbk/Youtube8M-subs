if I happen to be stopped one of the
other<00:01:26.070> features<00:01:26.340> we<00:01:27.030> can<00:01:27.150> turn<00:01:27.270> it<00:01:27.390> off<00:01:27.479> a

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
other features we can turn it off a

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.020 
other features we can turn it off a
quick<00:01:27.810> second<00:01:28.200> is<00:01:28.320> that<00:01:29.070> this<00:01:29.310> particular<00:01:29.640> bar

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
quick second is that this particular bar

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.330 
quick second is that this particular bar
has<00:01:30.329> got<00:01:30.479> red<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.140> blue<00:01:31.320> options<00:01:31.979> so<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.189> can

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
has got red and blue options so you can

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.330 
has got red and blue options so you can
switch<00:01:32.759> from<00:01:32.790> amber<00:01:33.450> over<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:34.470> red<00:01:34.680> or<00:01:34.920> blue

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
switch from amber over to red or blue

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.700 
switch from amber over to red or blue
depending<00:01:35.820> how<00:01:36.329> you've<00:01:36.600> arranged<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.350> actual

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
depending how you've arranged the actual

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.980 
depending how you've arranged the actual
light<00:01:37.950> modules<00:01:38.430> so<00:01:39.060> right<00:01:39.360> now<00:01:39.570> we've<00:01:39.810> got

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
light modules so right now we've got

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.410 
light modules so right now we've got
amber<00:01:40.439> on<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:40.829> we<00:01:41.280> can<00:01:41.430> switch<00:01:41.670> that<00:01:41.850> over<00:01:42.060> to

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
amber on and we can switch that over to

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.149 
amber on and we can switch that over to
law<00:01:42.869> enforcement<00:01:42.899> safety<00:01:43.680> colors<00:01:43.979> which

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
law enforcement safety colors which

this over to Amber with just the push of
a<00:02:00.000> button<00:02:00.030> so<00:02:00.540> essentially<00:02:01.229> what's<00:02:01.409> going<00:02:01.469> on

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
a button so essentially what's going on

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.469 
a button so essentially what's going on
as<00:02:02.009> I<00:02:02.130> mentioned<00:02:02.520> there<00:02:02.759> are<00:02:02.790> two<00:02:02.909> different

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
as I mentioned there are two different

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.780 
as I mentioned there are two different
colored<00:02:03.780> diodes<00:02:04.170> inside<00:02:04.920> this<00:02:05.430> particular

colored diodes inside this particular

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.119 
colored diodes inside this particular
reflector<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:06.689> that<00:02:07.079> essentially<00:02:07.560> is<00:02:07.890> what

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
reflector and that essentially is what

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.660 
reflector and that essentially is what
creates<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.970> whelen<00:02:09.360> duo<00:02:09.929> bar<00:02:10.410> now<00:02:11.099> you<00:02:11.160> can

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
creates the whelen duo bar now you can

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.400 
creates the whelen duo bar now you can
I'll<00:02:12.060> switch<00:02:12.239> back<00:02:12.270> over<00:02:12.540> to<00:02:12.660> red<00:02:12.900> and<00:02:13.020> blue

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
I'll switch back over to red and blue

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.740 
I'll switch back over to red and blue
you<00:02:14.220> have<00:02:14.460> got<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.910> ability<00:02:15.210> with<00:02:15.600> this

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
diodes so this one has six we're going

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.690 
diodes so this one has six we're going
to<00:02:49.230> take<00:02:49.320> a<00:02:49.380> look<00:02:49.560> inside<00:02:49.740> this<00:02:50.070> light<00:02:50.310> bar<00:02:50.550> and

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
to take a look inside this light bar and

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.910 
to take a look inside this light bar and
you'll<00:02:51.120> actually<00:02:51.330> see<00:02:51.780> that<00:02:51.810> the<00:02:52.140> duo<00:02:52.350> has<00:02:52.860> a

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
you'll actually see that the duo has a

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.030 
you'll actually see that the duo has a
total<00:02:53.400> of<00:02:53.550> 12<00:02:54.140> diodes<00:02:55.140> as<00:02:55.350> opposed<00:02:55.740> to<00:02:55.890> the

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
total of 12 diodes as opposed to the

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.770 
total of 12 diodes as opposed to the
standard<00:02:56.220> six<00:02:56.730> which<00:02:57.210> happens<00:02:57.480> to<00:02:57.540> be<00:02:57.660> in<00:02:57.750> my

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
standard six which happens to be in my

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.150 
standard six which happens to be in my
hand<00:02:58.280> so<00:02:59.280> I'm<00:02:59.340> going<00:02:59.460> to<00:02:59.490> slide<00:02:59.760> this<00:02:59.790> off<00:03:01.160> and

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
hand so I'm going to slide this off and

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.430 
hand so I'm going to slide this off and
we<00:03:02.250> can<00:03:02.370> take<00:03:02.520> a<00:03:02.550> look<00:03:02.820> inside<00:03:03.210> here<00:03:03.750> this

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
we can take a look inside here this

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:11.630 
we can take a look inside here this
takes<00:03:04.680> a<00:03:04.800> second<00:03:09.170> so<00:03:10.170> again<00:03:10.470> by<00:03:10.620> taking<00:03:11.010> a<00:03:11.220> look

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
takes a second so again by taking a look

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.370 
takes a second so again by taking a look
inside<00:03:11.820> here<00:03:12.390> we<00:03:12.450> get<00:03:12.540> the<00:03:12.630> camera<00:03:12.900> to<00:03:12.990> zoom<00:03:13.020> in

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
inside here we get the camera to zoom in

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.410 
inside here we get the camera to zoom in
you<00:03:13.680> can<00:03:13.710> see<00:03:14.000> there's<00:03:15.000> a<00:03:15.090> total<00:03:15.540> of<00:03:15.690> 12<00:03:16.530> diodes

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
you can see there's a total of 12 diodes

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.210 
you can see there's a total of 12 diodes
six<00:03:18.420> of<00:03:18.570> which<00:03:18.690> happen<00:03:19.080> to<00:03:19.110> be<00:03:19.200> amber<00:03:19.770> and<00:03:19.950> in

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
six of which happen to be amber and in

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.220 
six of which happen to be amber and in
this<00:03:20.310> particular<00:03:20.459> case<00:03:20.760> six<00:03:21.450> of<00:03:21.660> which<00:03:21.810> happen

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
this particular case six of which happen

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.170 
this particular case six of which happen
to<00:03:22.260> be<00:03:22.380> red<00:03:22.920> on<00:03:23.280> the<00:03:23.610> other<00:03:23.730> side<00:03:23.970> of<00:03:24.090> the

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
to be red on the other side of the

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.690 
to be red on the other side of the
vehicle<00:03:24.330> it's<00:03:24.959> the<00:03:25.200> reverse<00:03:25.500> because<00:03:25.770> six<00:03:26.520> are

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
vehicle it's the reverse because six are

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.340 
vehicle it's the reverse because six are
blue<00:03:26.910> and<00:03:27.290> six<00:03:28.290> are<00:03:28.470> amber<00:03:29.040> so<00:03:29.760> again<00:03:30.350> this

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
blue and six are amber so again this

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.050 
blue and six are amber so again this
allows<00:03:31.740> you<00:03:31.980> to<00:03:32.100> configure<00:03:32.400> the<00:03:32.610> bar<00:03:32.790> now<00:03:33.000> you

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
allows you to configure the bar now you

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.340 
allows you to configure the bar now you
could<00:03:33.360> also<00:03:33.630> of<00:03:34.140> course<00:03:34.200> have<00:03:34.740> six<00:03:35.250> red<00:03:35.610> and

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
could also of course have six red and

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.400 
could also of course have six red and
six<00:03:37.350> blue<00:03:37.890> in<00:03:38.340> the<00:03:38.850> same<00:03:39.090> housing<00:03:39.780> that<00:03:40.260> would

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
six blue in the same housing that would
