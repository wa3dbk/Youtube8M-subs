00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 additionally 1000 ps friends again 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.690
 I rise from spain from bytom in 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.799
 the proximity of alicante once again 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.870
 plays the weather with 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.639
 beautiful sunshine and again 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.559
 Once I get in touch with a honda 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.170
 presentation but not synonymous 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.330
 absolutely surprised since this year has 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.630
 Honda gives us a model tide again 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.880
 it does not surprise either 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.150
 the special once again equal 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.710
 two models at a presentation 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:33.540
 it is the new one 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:39.390
 5 Series 800 and I sit here on the cd 650 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:41.239
 f honda has a new entry-level model 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.140
 is especially concerned about the 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:45.149
 beginners that is not so 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.850
 unwise because that is a market segment 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.219
 of course is growing and 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.500
 Of course you can still get money there 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.710
 earn because the expensive devices 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.780
 Well, they are often around and 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.879
 are looked at but not 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.760
 bought and therefore has honda again 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.890
 the cd 650 f fully hit the black 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.409
 if you want you could say the cb 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.840
 650 replaces the hornet 600 but what 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.010
 not quite true because the hornet yes to 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.900
 some was stronger 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.619
 but that was not definitely flying out 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:19.170
 the program and dcb 650 11 comes as 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:21.950
 affordable naked bike after as well as the 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.820
 Hornet 600 also has the 26 50 f one 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.759
 four-cylinder engine became the 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.729
 but completely redeveloped 647 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:33.119
 cubic and performance under the 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.240
 hornet settled it has 87 ps 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.530
 a torque of 64 newton meters 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.630
 All in all, the Honda engineers have us 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.939
 already promised that a very 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.490
 powerful engine from below and in the 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.070
 should be middle 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.979
 we tested it today and me 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.899
 have to say the engine is very elastic 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.030
 so you can get it from far below 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.369
 turn up in the sixth gear too 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:00.240
 really nothing like there is no 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:03.030
 complaints but strong would be exaggerated 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.399
 she's up there then she turns up 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.649
 12,000 touring in the limiter 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.959
 rathert there she is then very strong 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.660
 between 9 and 12 thousand o'clock but from 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:15.660
 very far down, it would be exaggerated by 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.000
 much power to speak but 87 ps 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.069
 that's on four cylinders and he 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.370
 should not even the beginner 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:25.080
 overcharge of that one must say so 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.049
 Of course, they are strong enough 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:31.650
 and what about me in today's driving 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:34.709
 really on the winding roads here 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.049
 a fantastic driver i was extreme 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.989
 positively surprised by the brake system 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:43.590
 It is a two piston brake purely 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:46.709
 nothing radial, where I have already 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.150
 thought that could actually 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.790
 what will be quite weak 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.829
 Far missing his top brake system man 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.290
 it can produce so and she grabs 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:58.019
 neat too so there I was very much 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.450
 I was positively surprised by the chassis 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:01.680
 not surprised that's just like me 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.400
 it was expecting me 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:08.130
 that's a very good compromise it is 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:12.150
 on the one hand pleasantly comfortable though 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:15.180
 not quite which one fits for 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:18.420
 Country roads come down hard 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.970
 but overall, it is just one 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.579
 excellent compromise the 100th 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.510
 So that's possible 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:24.989
 I was not all right 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.190
 surprised 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.980
 they do not burn positively either 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:31.139
 surprised and the seating comfort is also 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.269
 very good you have to say that it 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:34.440
 comfortable and the sitting position is also 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.560
 maybe the top is 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.910
 kniewinkel but so far you have to 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.340
 get used to it is one 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.560
 entry-level motorcycle in which also smaller 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.269
 pilots come down to the ground 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.310
 This should work great 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:49.019
 you sit in the motorcycle inside 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.630
 you have a relatively wide handlebar 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:53.540
 the fittings 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.810
 well that's such a gimmick saying 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.550
 I'm just that's just more digital 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.350
 probably cheaper therefore just the 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:02.780
 Tachometer digital year you can do it 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:05.240
 not optimal read now you can him 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.560
 but read better than some 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:09.050
 years so I do not want me there either 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.150
 complaining speed will too 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:13.490
 displayed digitally that works that way 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.060
 always a tankuhr is with 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:15.440
 on board 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.750
 So it's actually complete 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.640
 equipped for a motorcycle that scarce 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:23.750
 You have to say 8000 euro costs 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:25.910
 she is actually very successful of the 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.850
 Of course, abs is always typical 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:31.460
 board meanwhile god thank you very much 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.890
 sophisticated abs system you can feel it 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.940
 simply does not work from there 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:37.040
 perfectly we are but also on 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.169
 German roads and had driven 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:42.319
 no complaints 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:44.360
 because of adverse conditions like 

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:45.949
 rain or other that is yes 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.759
 actually a miracle with me otherwise 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:50.090
 I always drive in the rain 

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:52.310
 but today super conditions only 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.779
 hope zebra crossing the goods 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.699
 absolutely smooth ice because you have it then 

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:57.529
 can try if that have it too 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:59.810
 really works yes it has 

00:04:57.529 --> 00:05:03.039
 it worked unobtrusively and is 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:05.779
 Therefore, to be rated as very positive 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:07.699
 Finally, here are the optics 

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:10.219
 if you just say that right now 

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:13.249
 want that the cb 650 fd legitimate 

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:14.509
 Successor of the Hornet 600 could be 

00:05:13.249 --> 00:05:16.969
 one also says she looks extremely 

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:19.879
 Athletic She has short overhangs 

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:21.919
 front and back that gives her one 

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:23.539
 Sporty touch is the light up front 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:28.520
 very stylish very successful 

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:29.960
 The line is also sporty and easy 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.909
 and just cut 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.909
 in the back there is a led light what wants 

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:36.379
 one more the hrc tricolor varnish and 

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:38.990
 fantastic at all with that 

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:41.419
 golden rims yes so from my side 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:43.699
 There is no complaint about the price 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:45.979
 goes well the offered goes well 

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:47.839
 alright well and honda still has 

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:49.360
 a very good name even if you 

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:52.789
 multiplies beginner segment Us 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:55.039
 took care of the quality of my opinion 

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:58.870
 after yes not suffered so 100 

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:58.870
 much success with the 26 50 f
