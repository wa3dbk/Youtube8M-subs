00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.390
 bread of this race the finals of the 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.830
 Intercontinental Cup from F3 to Macao on 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.110
 start of the main race is 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.969
 party with a good start for fÃ©lix ross 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.530
 also fisher who is better off 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.480
 so I do not know if it's a choice 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.830
 strategic rosenquist to have missed 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.359
 a little his departure for not getting 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.070
 find on stage or breakers who is 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.630
 passed luca savior who took the 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.769
 first position and eva as when 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.269
 the qualifying race 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.130
 when the man backstage with the 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.609
 single seat yellow outside number 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.949
 14 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.189
 esteban ocon goes on the attack also where 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.450
 it's hot there behind synthes made 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:36.690
 bench attention because the suction 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.280
 in my opinion had to exceed at the wat excavations 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.079
 to esteban ocon who is inside 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.360
 he will try to take the second 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.020
 place and it clings to the needs of 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.510
 clients and law 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.739
 ocon hit hard the station 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.399
 he still remains in front of and shortly 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.710
 behind that kind of it stephen points you 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.840
 at impressive this picture 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.219
 it will put red skin red skin 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.699
 mandatory given the number of cars that 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.719
 are piled up in the bend there this is the 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.660
 big pileup 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.250
 there have bottled age behind 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.080
 behind esteban ocon and tom hicks and 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.060
 hot I understood from the lamb hooked 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.860
 who touched each other and a car that 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.360
 climbed to look on the wall of tires 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.290
 to it failed not very far from 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.909
 curators she went up on 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.659
 blomquist in fact so it served to 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.390
 springboard 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.580
 but this shift is extremely well known 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.860
 for that in fact since it's just 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.240
 after the funnel of the hotel lisboa and 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.369
 suddenly everyone finds themselves a little 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.020
 cot cot and as soon as we rolled 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.650
 slightly out of the way with 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.180
 a little dust 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.009
 this was among others perhaps the case 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.079
 also for cons who suddenly could not 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.549
 rob as he wanted and he took away 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.060
 a blomquist in the in the wall of 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.860
 pneumatic 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.799
 unless his nose gear has been hit 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.450
 also when they got closer to 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.040
 first turns maybe we'll 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.840
 to be able to see again 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.980
 the scene has slowed down for good 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.900
 to dissect all that in any case 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.120
 bloomquist had made a great start 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.830
 had taken advantage of the suction sowers is 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.250
 just behind at the tale was was in 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.250
 ambush 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.810
 and gold which are a braking pariah that 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.360
 it is he who shoots who shoots three is 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.280
 Lucky Savior and Cala Braking 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.600
 and agents case will be winners esteban 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.459
 ocon the tables since they are 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.920
 hung once before 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.150
 then finish their race and there the 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.400
 chance to come to the hours because he 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.220
 could not have turned he could have 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.480
 claude have to wait until the maybe 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.980
 the full platoon that passes before 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.030
 come back that was rather not too bad 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.440
 passed for him what is found 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.540
 currently second so we're going 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.800
 just revisit the slow motion of this 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.720
 hanging in the first round we see 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.709
 already that behind that it touched a 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.930
 point such as pilot 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.489
 at the exit of this fast break so 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.320
 blomquist is outside in the middle 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.000
 he missed his braking bloomquist goes 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.800
 wanting to take advantage of the space 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.120
 on the cons there the half- stream 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.650
 we may be slightly affected 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.690
 which will prevent him from being able to turn 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.880
 correctly after the last howard a 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.250
 still could turn rosenquist and on 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.600
 inside he protects himself a little and there 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.830
 this is where we will see to build and 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.830
 it is all remained
