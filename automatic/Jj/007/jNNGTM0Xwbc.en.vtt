00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:14.320
 in 2004 my son Sasha and I decided 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:18.279
 build a raft and go on it 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:20.310
 swimming on the river Kuban and the 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:24.099
 suitable material for construction 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:27.419
 this plastic bottle was collected 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:27.419
 1000 pieces 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:56.910
 the first thing done pontoons 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.910
 five hundred bottles in each 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:28.140
 further made the deck is a timber board 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:31.240
 plywood size of our catamaran plaza 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:36.300
 was two and a half meters wide 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.300
 and 6 and a half meters wife 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:56.640
 construction lasted several months 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:02:00.950
 due to lack of free time 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:04.530
 home-work and such crazy hobbies 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:09.920
 there is no time at all and no 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.920
 less time went by and the raft was built 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:32.260
 like all normal ships he had 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:34.740
 sail oars for maneuvering 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.110
 and of course the steering wheel 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:50.790
 he received the title in honor of the famous 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:54.150
 Kuban silver carp fish is the day 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.760
 departure catamaran transformer was 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:00.860
 brought by truck for parts 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.860
 they are assembled right on the shore 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:22.460
 but 

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.930
 above 

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:47.039
 our voyage was short 

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:51.770
 few days but believe these events 

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:51.770
 we will never forget for several days
