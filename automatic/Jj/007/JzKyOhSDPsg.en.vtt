and see what kind of elements worked and

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:35.940 
and see what kind of elements worked and
what<00:01:34.030> kind<00:01:34.210> of<00:01:34.270> ours<00:01:34.509> didn't<00:01:34.899> work<00:01:35.049> you<00:01:35.829> know

what kind of ours didn't work you know
like<00:01:36.189> for<00:01:36.460> example<00:01:36.549> those<00:01:37.000> a<00:01:37.030> song<00:01:37.329> that<00:01:37.359> had<00:01:37.750> I

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:38.049 
like for example those a song that had I

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:38.790 
like for example those a song that had I
really<00:01:38.439> have

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:38.800 
really have

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.070 
really have
Marvin<00:01:39.160> a<00:01:39.280> sample<00:01:39.730> of<00:01:39.790> him<00:01:39.970> singing<00:01:40.180> so<00:01:41.050> I

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
Marvin a sample of him singing so I

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.960 
Marvin a sample of him singing so I
figured<00:01:41.650> if<00:01:41.890> I'm<00:01:42.070> going<00:01:42.160> to<00:01:42.250> remix<00:01:42.520> it<00:01:42.670> I<00:01:42.790> kind

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
figured if I'm going to remix it I kind

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.280 
figured if I'm going to remix it I kind
of<00:01:43.090> have<00:01:43.210> to<00:01:43.240> give<00:01:43.450> the<00:01:43.510> best<00:01:43.660> same<00:01:43.870> elements

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
of have to give the best same elements

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:45.600

that's<00:03:14.349> adding<00:03:14.980> like<00:03:15.010> a<00:03:15.190> new<00:03:15.400> flavor<00:03:15.640> to<00:03:15.940> it

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
that's adding like a new flavor to it

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.910 
that's adding like a new flavor to it
and<00:03:16.300> keeping<00:03:16.690> keeping<00:03:16.959> what<00:03:17.260> you<00:03:17.380> have<00:03:17.560> fresh

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
and keeping keeping what you have fresh

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.309 
and keeping keeping what you have fresh
it's<00:03:18.819> always<00:03:19.090> a<00:03:19.120> plus<00:03:19.420> for<00:03:19.630> me<00:03:19.690> but<00:03:20.050> I'm<00:03:20.140> all

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 
it's always a plus for me but I'm all

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:22.350 
it's always a plus for me but I'm all
for<00:03:20.470> any<00:03:20.620> kind<00:03:20.830> of<00:03:20.950> change<00:03:21.160> in<00:03:21.370> music<00:03:21.730> so<00:03:21.970> that

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
for any kind of change in music so that

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.059 
for any kind of change in music so that
is<00:03:22.510> always<00:03:22.780> going<00:03:23.019> to<00:03:23.110> be<00:03:23.170> an<00:03:23.260> evolution<00:03:23.830> and

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.069 
is always going to be an evolution and

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:27.600 
is always going to be an evolution and
it's<00:03:24.489> all<00:03:24.670> about<00:03:24.910> how<00:03:25.330> you<00:03:25.750> can<00:03:26.170> kind<00:03:26.440> of<00:03:26.610> you

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
it's all about how you can kind of you

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.900 
it's all about how you can kind of you
know<00:03:27.780> if<00:03:28.780> you<00:03:29.319> got<00:03:29.470> to<00:03:29.590> either<00:03:29.709> evolve<00:03:30.160> or<00:03:30.640> kind

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
know if you got to either evolve or kind

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.120 
know if you got to either evolve or kind
of<00:03:31.000> me<00:03:31.060> left<00:03:31.239> behind<00:03:31.569> and<00:03:32.530> I<00:03:32.590> think<00:03:32.650> that<00:03:32.860> goes

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
of me left behind and I think that goes

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.000 
of me left behind and I think that goes
for<00:03:33.160> any<00:03:33.459> kind<00:03:33.670> of<00:03:33.760> scene<00:03:34.000> that<00:03:34.209> starts<00:03:34.959> so<00:03:35.170> you

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
for any kind of scene that starts so you

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.460 
for any kind of scene that starts so you
know<00:03:36.160> uu<00:03:36.970> la<00:03:37.269> San<00:03:37.540> Jose<00:03:37.810> call<00:03:38.110> it<00:03:38.230> or<00:03:38.319> whatever

know uu la San Jose call it or whatever

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.309 
know uu la San Jose call it or whatever
if<00:03:38.830> it's<00:03:39.730> you<00:03:40.060> know<00:03:40.180> it's<00:03:40.209> just<00:03:40.480> it's<00:03:40.900> like<00:03:41.170> an

organic thing just naturally you know

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:46.080 
organic thing just naturally you know
evolved<00:03:43.660> into<00:03:43.840> what<00:03:43.870> it<00:03:44.049> is<00:03:44.230> and<00:03:44.650> you<00:03:45.090> know

it's I'm all for it budgeted ya gonna be

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:52.380 
it's I'm all for it budgeted ya gonna be
bringin<00:03:50.470> it's<00:03:51.160> the<00:03:51.310> fact<00:03:51.519> that<00:03:51.670> dub<00:03:52.030> the

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
bringin it's the fact that dub the

bringin it's the fact that dub the
dubstep<00:03:52.750> thing<00:03:52.900> caught<00:03:53.380> on<00:03:53.530> so<00:03:53.739> hot<00:03:53.950> in<00:03:54.099> LA<00:03:54.220> was

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
dubstep thing caught on so hot in LA was

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:55.770 
dubstep thing caught on so hot in LA was
you<00:03:55.000> know<00:03:55.120> it<00:03:55.239> kind<00:03:55.480> of

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
you know it kind of

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.530 
you know it kind of
the<00:03:56.620> right<00:03:56.860> thing<00:03:57.190> I<00:03:57.490> think<00:03:58.240> we're<00:03:58.330> just<00:03:58.360> gonna

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
the right thing I think we're just gonna

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.150 
the right thing I think we're just gonna
keep<00:03:58.750> seeing<00:03:58.990> more<00:03:59.230> and<00:03:59.260> more<00:03:59.380> that<00:03:59.709> you<00:04:00.040> know

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
keep seeing more and more that you know

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.220 
keep seeing more and more that you know
I<00:04:00.400> mean<00:04:00.610> it's<00:04:01.270> been<00:04:01.450> a<00:04:01.480> big<00:04:01.750> influence<00:04:02.650> of

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
I mean it's been a big influence of

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.020 
I mean it's been a big influence of
kaylee<00:04:05.230> style<00:04:05.650> music<00:04:05.800> all<00:04:06.160> night<00:04:06.340> in<00:04:06.490> America

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
kaylee style music all night in America

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.330 
kaylee style music all night in America
and<00:04:07.840> I<00:04:08.170> think<00:04:08.410> the<00:04:08.500> future<00:04:08.709> is<00:04:08.860> just<00:04:09.010> been<00:04:09.190> here

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
and I think the future is just been here

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:10.860 
and I think the future is just been here
for<00:04:09.490> more<00:04:09.700> and<00:04:09.819> more<00:04:10.000> than<00:04:10.330> the<00:04:10.720> other

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
for more and more than the other

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.840 
for more and more than the other
countries<00:04:11.350> that<00:04:11.590> push<00:04:12.100> for<00:04:12.310> it<00:04:12.400> they're<00:04:12.730> all

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
countries that push for it they're all

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.059 
countries that push for it they're all
sounds<00:04:13.450> that<00:04:14.140> are<00:04:14.470> eventually<00:04:14.709> going<00:04:15.010> to

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:15.069 
sounds that are eventually going to

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:17.640 
sounds that are eventually going to
become<00:04:15.580> a<00:04:15.610> part<00:04:15.970> of<00:04:16.090> American<00:04:16.690> culture<00:04:16.720> so<00:04:17.380> I

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
become a part of American culture so I

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.140 
become a part of American culture so I
think<00:04:18.010> it's<00:04:18.280> not<00:04:18.549> really<00:04:18.820> what<00:04:18.940> with<00:04:19.030> the

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
think it's not really what with the

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:20.539 
think it's not really what with the
inning<00:04:19.389> and<00:04:19.540> everything<00:04:19.959> else<00:04:20.139> that

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
inning and everything else that

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.010 
inning and everything else that
eventually<00:04:21.549> we<00:04:21.700> all<00:04:21.730> play<00:04:22.270> catch<00:04:22.510> up<00:04:22.540> to<00:04:22.840> their

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
eventually we all play catch up to their

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.730 
eventually we all play catch up to their
trends<00:04:23.410> oh<00:04:24.060> I<00:04:25.060> definitely<00:04:25.450> think<00:04:25.780> that<00:04:26.169> you

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
trends oh I definitely think that you

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.820 
trends oh I definitely think that you
know<00:04:26.860> it's<00:04:27.730> kind<00:04:28.090> of<00:04:28.210> inevitable<00:04:28.450> for<00:04:29.110> all

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
know it's kind of inevitable for all

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.860 
know it's kind of inevitable for all
kinds<00:04:30.010> of<00:04:30.190> sounds<00:04:30.370> to<00:04:30.700> that<00:04:30.940> mash<00:04:31.600> together

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
kinds of sounds to that mash together

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.500 
kinds of sounds to that mash together
form<00:04:32.440> their<00:04:32.620> own<00:04:32.650> things<00:04:33.160> I<00:04:33.510> don't

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
form their own things I don't

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:36.000 
form their own things I don't
necessarily<00:04:34.630> think<00:04:34.930> it's<00:04:35.200> a<00:04:35.230> bad<00:04:35.440> thing<00:04:35.470> I

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
necessarily think it's a bad thing I

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:37.890 
necessarily think it's a bad thing I
just<00:04:36.340> think<00:04:36.550> it's<00:04:36.790> it's<00:04:37.150> kind<00:04:37.540> of<00:04:37.600> you<00:04:37.870> know

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
just think it's it's kind of you know

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.270 
just think it's it's kind of you know
something<00:04:38.350> that's<00:04:38.500> just<00:04:38.560> going<00:04:38.860> to<00:04:38.950> happen

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
something that's just going to happen

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.640 
something that's just going to happen
and<00:04:39.880> after<00:04:40.360> a<00:04:40.390> while<00:04:40.570> certain<00:04:41.110> sounds<00:04:41.500> get

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
and after a while certain sounds get

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.290 
and after a while certain sounds get
older<00:04:42.010> and<00:04:42.250> they<00:04:42.430> start<00:04:42.850> to<00:04:42.910> take<00:04:43.090> on

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
older and they start to take on

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.659 
older and they start to take on
different<00:04:43.540> entrances<00:04:44.320> and<00:04:44.950> eventually<00:04:45.490> those

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 
different entrances and eventually those

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:47.100 
different entrances and eventually those
two<00:04:45.850> influences<00:04:46.300> come<00:04:46.570> together<00:04:46.840> and<00:04:47.020> they

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
two influences come together and they

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.380 
two influences come together and they
create<00:04:47.410> a<00:04:47.440> whole<00:04:47.650> new<00:04:47.680> genre<00:04:47.830> of<00:04:48.250> music<00:04:48.400> you

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:49.390 
create a whole new genre of music you

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:51.120 
create a whole new genre of music you
know<00:04:49.510> and<00:04:49.810> that's<00:04:50.500> kind<00:04:50.710> of<00:04:50.770> how<00:04:50.890> hip-hop

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
know and that's kind of how hip-hop

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.520 
know and that's kind of how hip-hop
start<00:04:51.580> it<00:04:51.700> was<00:04:51.820> kind<00:04:52.090> of<00:04:52.150> like<00:04:52.530> the

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
start it was kind of like the

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.340 
start it was kind of like the
combination<00:04:53.770> of<00:04:54.310> like<00:04:54.580> disco<00:04:55.419> and<00:04:55.630> funk<00:04:55.690> rock

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.350 
combination of like disco and funk rock

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.469 
combination of like disco and funk rock
