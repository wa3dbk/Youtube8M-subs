up<00:02:20.810> a<00:02:20.900> story<00:02:21.050> work<00:02:21.350> with<00:02:21.500> each<00:02:21.620> other<00:02:21.770> so<00:02:21.860> it's

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
up a story work with each other so it's

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.770 
up a story work with each other so it's
not<00:02:22.490> really<00:02:22.550> weird<00:02:23.030> that<00:02:23.240> the<00:02:23.330> people<00:02:23.480> who<00:02:23.690> are

not really weird that the people who are
creating<00:02:24.260> that<00:02:24.410> story<00:02:24.680> would<00:02:24.950> try<00:02:25.190> to<00:02:25.220> make

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
creating that story would try to make

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.280 
creating that story would try to make

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
with the old bits but what is really

with the old bits but what is really
weird<00:02:29.810> is<00:02:30.020> that<00:02:30.050> the<00:02:30.290> people<00:02:30.410> who<00:02:30.650> currently

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
weird is that the people who currently

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.530 
weird is that the people who currently
own<00:02:31.250> the<00:02:31.430> franchise<00:02:31.850> can<00:02:32.090> make<00:02:32.239> some
