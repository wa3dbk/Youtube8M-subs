show you what I noticed like of course
the<00:01:33.659> eco<00:01:34.020> styler<00:01:35.390> it's<00:01:36.390> not<00:01:36.689> really<00:01:37.049> just

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
the eco styler it's not really just

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.410 
the eco styler it's not really just
gonna<00:01:37.439> fall<00:01:37.680> out<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.280> know<00:01:38.759> it's<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.150> little

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
gonna fall out you know it's a little

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.830 
gonna fall out you know it's a little
stiffer<00:01:39.689> than<00:01:39.990> that<00:01:40.229> extreme<00:01:41.189> weight<00:01:42.030> line<00:01:42.329> if

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
stiffer than that extreme weight line if

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.639 
stiffer than that extreme weight line if
you<00:01:43.439> see<00:01:43.920> I<00:01:44.600> don't<00:01:45.600> want<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:45.990> come<00:01:46.200> out<00:01:46.350> but

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
you see I don't want it to come out but

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:52.039 
you see I don't want it to come out but
it's<00:01:47.100> moving<00:01:47.340> forward<00:01:47.990> see<00:01:49.460> easily<00:01:50.460> so<00:01:51.060> it<00:01:51.810> is

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
it's moving forward see easily so it is

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.510 
it's moving forward see easily so it is
a<00:01:52.110> lot<00:01:52.490> looser<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.990> texture<00:01:54.990> this<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:56.070> reminds

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
a lot looser and texture this it reminds

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.670 
a lot looser and texture this it reminds
me<00:01:56.850> of<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.540> mix<00:01:58.079> between<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.950> gel<00:01:59.640> and<00:01:59.880> a<00:02:00.680> regular

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
me of a mix between a gel and a regular

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.810 
me of a mix between a gel and a regular
holding<00:02:02.070> gel<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.579> an<00:02:02.670> active<00:02:03.149> air

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
holding gel and an active air

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.960 
holding gel and an active air
so<00:02:05.820> it's<00:02:06.030> looser<00:02:06.659> than<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:07.409> ecostyler<00:02:08.069> and

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
so it's looser than the ecostyler and

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.390 
so it's looser than the ecostyler and
also<00:02:09.720> what<00:02:09.869> I<00:02:09.899> found<00:02:10.259> was<00:02:10.619> I<00:02:10.920> have<00:02:11.130> it<00:02:11.220> in<00:02:11.310> my

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
also what I found was I have it in my

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.360 
also what I found was I have it in my
hair<00:02:11.610> right<00:02:11.790> now<00:02:12.030> it<00:02:12.750> leaves<00:02:13.500> my<00:02:13.830> hair<00:02:14.099> with<00:02:14.340> a

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
hair right now it leaves my hair with a

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.400 
hair right now it leaves my hair with a
little<00:02:14.970> more<00:02:15.360> Sheen<00:02:15.900> or<00:02:16.760> shine<00:02:17.760> to<00:02:18.209> it<00:02:18.410> than

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
little more Sheen or shine to it than

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.580 
little more Sheen or shine to it than
the<00:02:19.739> eco<00:02:20.130> styler<00:02:20.489> and<00:02:20.880> it's<00:02:21.480> weird<00:02:21.810> because<00:02:22.080> it

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
the eco styler and it's weird because it

you can see but not enough to be you

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.590 
you can see but not enough to be you
know<00:02:31.950> how<00:02:32.100> the<00:02:32.160> eco<00:02:32.760> styler<00:02:33.150> dries<00:02:35.569> with<00:02:36.569> a

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
these just like it does the eco styler

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:49.250 
these just like it does the eco styler
on<00:03:43.459> pros<00:03:44.459> and<00:03:44.760> cons<00:03:46.220> the<00:03:47.220> pros<00:03:47.250> are<00:03:47.910> to<00:03:48.690> me<00:03:48.900> it's

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
on pros and cons the pros are to me it's

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.509 
on pros and cons the pros are to me it's
the<00:03:49.530> lighter<00:03:49.799> hold

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
the lighter hold

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.030 
the lighter hold
I<00:03:50.640> still<00:03:51.209> get<00:03:51.450> curl<00:03:51.750> definition<00:03:52.019> but<00:03:52.980> the

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
I still get curl definition but the

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.770 
I still get curl definition but the
curled<00:03:53.549> is<00:03:53.730> the<00:03:54.420> the<00:03:54.720> hold<00:03:54.959> of<00:03:55.260> the<00:03:55.380> curl<00:03:55.590> is

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
curled is the the hold of the curl is

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.970 
curled is the the hold of the curl is
light<00:03:57.780> enough<00:03:58.140> where<00:03:58.470> if<00:03:59.389> like<00:04:00.530> on<00:04:01.530> a<00:04:01.590> day

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.470 
if you could tell you know it's a hold

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.800 
if you could tell you know it's a hold

like<00:05:18.290> I<00:05:18.380> said<00:05:18.560> it<00:05:18.620> movable<00:05:20.260> also<00:05:21.460> I<00:05:22.460> hate<00:05:22.970> the

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.150 
like I said it movable also I hate the

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.659 
like I said it movable also I hate the
fact<00:05:23.360> that<00:05:23.540> this<00:05:23.960> is<00:05:24.200> not<00:05:24.229> easily<00:05:24.740> found<00:05:25.340> the

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:25.669 
fact that this is not easily found the

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:28.090 
fact that this is not easily found the
weight<00:05:25.850> line<00:05:26.060> does<00:05:26.240> not<00:05:26.419> easily<00:05:26.600> found<00:05:26.990> so<00:05:27.710> it

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:28.100 
weight line does not easily found so it

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.460 
weight line does not easily found so it
cannot<00:05:28.520> replace<00:05:29.150> my<00:05:29.419> eco<00:05:29.810> styler<00:05:30.169> just

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:30.470 
cannot replace my eco styler just

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:34.210 
cannot replace my eco styler just
because<00:05:30.770> I'm<00:05:31.700> not<00:05:31.970> for<00:05:32.300> sure<00:05:32.360> you<00:05:33.229> know<00:05:33.380> how

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:34.220 
because I'm not for sure you know how

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.240 
because I'm not for sure you know how
easily<00:05:34.669> it<00:05:35.450> it<00:05:36.350> would<00:05:36.530> be<00:05:36.680> found<00:05:36.890> on<00:05:37.160> the

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.250 
easily it it would be found on the

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.690 
easily it it would be found on the
shelves<00:05:37.520> or<00:05:37.850> like<00:05:38.770> my<00:05:39.770> sister<00:05:40.220> bought<00:05:40.370> some

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:40.700 
shelves or like my sister bought some

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.659 
shelves or like my sister bought some
today<00:05:41.560> off<00:05:42.560> the<00:05:42.800> shelf<00:05:43.040> and<00:05:43.190> she<00:05:43.310> bought<00:05:43.490> the

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:43.669 
today off the shelf and she bought the

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:46.330 
today off the shelf and she bought the
last<00:05:43.850> one<00:05:44.180> so<00:05:44.470> I'm<00:05:45.470> not<00:05:45.650> for<00:05:45.890> sure<00:05:45.919> if<00:05:46.190> it's

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:46.340 
last one so I'm not for sure if it's

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.159 
last one so I'm not for sure if it's
coming<00:05:46.520> back<00:05:46.700> in<00:05:47.000> the<00:05:47.330> people<00:05:47.720> that<00:05:47.870> work<00:05:48.050> in

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:48.169 
coming back in the people that work in

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:50.380 
coming back in the people that work in
Sally's<00:05:48.650> weren't<00:05:49.430> really<00:05:49.700> familiar<00:05:49.910> with

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:50.390 
Sally's weren't really familiar with

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:54.550 
Sally's weren't really familiar with
this<00:05:50.540> gel<00:05:50.840> so<00:05:51.229> yeah<00:05:52.040> but<00:05:52.460> overall<00:05:52.850> if<00:05:53.780> it<00:05:54.410> was

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:54.560 
this gel so yeah but overall if it was

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.450 
this gel so yeah but overall if it was
easily<00:05:55.040> found<00:05:55.280> I<00:05:55.850> probably<00:05:56.780> would<00:05:57.080> choose<00:05:57.500> the

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:58.460 
easily found I probably would choose the

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.640 
easily found I probably would choose the
extreme<00:05:58.880> wet<00:05:59.150> line<00:05:59.390> over<00:05:59.870> the<00:05:59.960> eco<00:06:00.320> styler

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:00.650 
extreme wet line over the eco styler

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:04.750 
extreme wet line over the eco styler
just<00:06:01.490> for<00:06:01.790> the<00:06:03.160> machine<00:06:04.160> it<00:06:04.340> gives<00:06:04.550> my<00:06:04.729> hair

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:04.760 
just for the machine it gives my hair

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:08.070 
just for the machine it gives my hair
alone<00:06:05.180> and<00:06:05.600> it<00:06:05.810> does<00:06:06.020> have<00:06:06.350> a<00:06:06.380> soft<00:06:06.650> to<00:06:06.890> hold

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:08.080 
alone and it does have a soft to hold

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:12.280 
alone and it does have a soft to hold
but<00:06:09.080> that<00:06:09.919> soft<00:06:10.280> the<00:06:10.490> whole<00:06:10.729> kind<00:06:11.180> of<00:06:11.390> makes<00:06:12.050> me

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:12.290 
but that soft the whole kind of makes me

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:14.469 
but that soft the whole kind of makes me
feel<00:06:12.320> like<00:06:12.500> my<00:06:12.860> hair<00:06:13.100> shrinks<00:06:13.370> more<00:06:13.850> with<00:06:14.270> that

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:14.479 
feel like my hair shrinks more with that

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:18.810 
feel like my hair shrinks more with that
softer<00:06:14.930> hold<00:06:16.810> but<00:06:17.810> to<00:06:18.169> each<00:06:18.320> his<00:06:18.350> own

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:18.820 
softer hold but to each his own

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:22.029 
softer hold but to each his own
also<00:06:19.820> I<00:06:20.390> tried<00:06:21.050> a<00:06:21.080> different<00:06:21.530> method<00:06:21.890> this

00:06:22.029 --> 00:06:22.039 
also I tried a different method this

00:06:22.039 --> 00:06:26.170 
also I tried a different method this
time<00:06:22.340> so<00:06:22.729> maybe<00:06:24.789> the

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:26.180 
time so maybe the

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.360 
time so maybe the
there<00:06:26.419> could<00:06:26.630> be<00:06:26.660> a<00:06:26.810> reason<00:06:27.229> I<00:06:27.320> did<00:06:27.860> the

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:28.370 
there could be a reason I did the

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:30.460 
there could be a reason I did the
smoothing<00:06:28.850> method<00:06:29.150> this<00:06:29.300> time<00:06:29.539> which<00:06:30.080> I<00:06:30.259> would

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:30.470 
smoothing method this time which I would

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:34.180 
smoothing method this time which I would
not<00:06:30.620> do<00:06:30.830> again<00:06:31.690> it<00:06:32.690> comes<00:06:33.050> my<00:06:33.590> curls<00:06:34.009> together

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:34.190 
not do again it comes my curls together

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:36.700 
not do again it comes my curls together
more<00:06:34.699> but<00:06:35.120> I<00:06:35.150> kind<00:06:35.509> of<00:06:35.570> like<00:06:35.720> my<00:06:35.900> hair<00:06:36.110> Wilder
