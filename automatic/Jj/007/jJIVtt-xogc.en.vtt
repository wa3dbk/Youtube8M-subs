00:00:00.569 --> 00:00:06.339
 hello aired on meshuggah and still 

00:00:03.939 --> 00:00:08.830
 thick part this time brought us on 

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:11.860
 karelia battle ninth level and this is the 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.299
 hell somewhere somewhere apart falls also 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.009
 It is worth noting that Karelia 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:16.930
 literally the same in this patch 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:19.660
 dug over here i still have test leads and 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:22.120
 gameplay how can you use new 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.190
 races that are done and played here 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:27.730
 aggressive enough to draw your 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:31.990
 attention that the enemy has 3 fireflies 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:34.510
 t37 bulldog and 1390 and play aggressively in 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.940
 this setup is not very correct 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.340
 but I'm looking for a gameplay looking for as much as possible 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:42.580
 it is interesting to play this card therefore dust 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:45.070
 on danger what's the matter here did 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.480
 check in the pants from the center and here I am 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.110
 by the way i'm trying lately 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.329
 use 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.430
 shine up to 244 and you know what 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:53.739
 do me there getting nothing right there from 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.020
 Super Pershing candle and with 8 and understand 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:58.899
 that everything is bad, I clamped at the very stone 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:01.239
 after shooting cracker immediately leaving yes 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:03.820
 him for shchi and trying to snap and 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:06.190
 survive somehow in such conditions the hull 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.470
 my very big and that's so thin 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:11.200
 stone barely fit again 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.150
 punish rusk I thought I caught 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.490
 I go to him, but then he fixed it right away 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.140
 go safe put the case diagonally 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.600
 so as not to arrive and as soon as the cracker 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.040
 stayed shot I take it perfectly 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.380
 one less danger 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.810
 I also want to draw your attention to that 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.830
 fight three artillery and play right here 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.799
 extremely carefully 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.250
 I think that crackers do not shine me 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:37.420
 big I will be able to tighten in the center and 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:40.150
 a little bit wrong I am here t37 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.790
 here's straight bread do not feed let me get stuck in 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.770
 bushes somewhere a firefly is very stupid 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.930
 position on his part but me he is 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.939
 He captures or conveys prodamazhil I gave already 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.950
 half of their hp do not say that right 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:52.930
 strongly with the benefit of only one 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.390
 crackers took and that's hello from art 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.909
 hello you have few problems we 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.250
 we throw you a couple shine 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:02.650
 through bushes find super pershing and with 8 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.630
 and I understand that all this really bad for me these 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.000
 guys just forget about me they me 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.039
 will take plus plus I can not leave here 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.889
 when i will leave here i will be in 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.360
 shoot these guys things support 

00:02:11.889 --> 00:02:16.060
 fire but three cormorants 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.860
 on the left they just do not know 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.900
 understand that you have to turn your three 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.730
 brainless head and shoot the guys 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.550
 who stick out their poop 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.980
 help comes unexpectedly from artillery 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.020
 that's what help from her i'm for sure 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.660
 here did not expect immediately take away 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:34.630
 superpershing strongly punishes is a 8 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:37.240
 nov I'll take another shot from the art 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.990
 Of course fat park is also the most dangerous 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:44.290
 the tank in the game need to urgently focus it 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:45.130
 with the help of 49 and the virginity is obtained 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.770
 survive here 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:50.200
 press all that came here it turns out 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:53.050
 even save a little bit hp principle 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.810
 not bad and here the fight begins 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:59.170
 t37 obvious distance it can hardly 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:01.420
 shoot off move him to attack 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.520
 lo this is also a stupid idea because 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.620
 I am fugassnitsa they are a normal trunk 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.750
 so I stop in the bushes and 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.940
 just highlight but nothing more for me 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.470
 It does not remain because to slip past 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.570
 he wouldnâ€™t have come to my artillery 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.450
 too big tank and yes hepe is not enough 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:18.700
 perfectly 37 takes 40 nine and 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.590
 understandably the path is now free 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.500
 not light only artillery means 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:26.140
 enemy base is clean not protected 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.760
 no one else except brown and dry 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.340
 shone all heavy too 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.680
 we find them 4043 in my opinion it's not even me 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.989
 Someone else has lightened it up 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.850
 slowly to her here is already becoming 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:38.920
 plus or minus just left to make out 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:42.400
 defenseless art maybe even help with 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.500
 Fri-shkoy but everything will not be as good as I 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.290
 originally planned art takes 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.930
 allies I just reached Denmark and 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.299
 then pay attention to ISU-152 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:55.150
 our boys are just starting 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:57.820
 drive up and i'm trying a little bit of her in 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:00.850
 poter pot here you see even poop 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.690
 my unhappy landmine I with ISU-152 not 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.209
 punching 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.280
 I throw a bead unfortunately without damage 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:09.989
 it happens on fugaby 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:12.730
 rarely and water already in the board pierce 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:15.359
 unexpectedly unfortunately only 300 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:18.040
 damage but even 300 is quite good 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:19.959
 allies find another art I understand 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.050
 that I had only one felt boot 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.720
 loan 12 I just did not have time to come but 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.490
 I think 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.800
 Aliana there somewhere for shkreetsya get 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:30.170
 I have and do and getting a small circle 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.000
 hoping to meet a valenoka somewhere and 

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:33.620
 here I think he will most likely be 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.900
 somewhere near the flag because it 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.090
 fairly slow art near me 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.130
 I make a mistake I stop and try 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:43.640
 backs back to the safe and now I'm 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:48.050
 I do yes I get from the guard as a landmine 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:50.240
 now it turned out to be the result here 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.310
 watch sign laz nasty master well and 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.410
 one distinctive mark if to someone 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:57.980
 interesting is the funniest thing is that i 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:05:00.920
 got 1287 net experience and not 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:03.800
 be deceived this is not for 873 damage and two 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:06.680
 fraga it for four thousand two hundred forty 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.810
 eight of us eternal damage ode below 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.400
 list was one of the most helpful in 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.770
 the team played extremely aggressively and 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.870
 survived to the last also turned out 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:18.560
 33 thousand seven hundred with straight 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:20.510
 account and 17,800 without a prema that beating 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.240
 interesting for you to say but I would not 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:25.340
 said he opened some kind of stratum 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.350
 which will surely give you a lot of damage 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:29.930
 damage or saturate a lot like me in this 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:31.520
 I played extremely aggressively in combat and 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:33.740
 would say that it is directly justified 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.230
 because without the support of allies you 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:38.480
 there they will simply trample and not notice, but if 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:40.970
 you play a platoon then you have quite a 

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:43.070
 there is a good chance of success but on this 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:44.780
 all with you was meshuggah good luck in randomness 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:47.290
 and see you soon 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.290
 happily
