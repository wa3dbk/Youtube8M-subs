00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:55.830 
right out of the pits and it we knew

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.470 
right out of the pits and it we knew
straight<00:00:56.160> away<00:00:56.190> that<00:00:56.400> we<00:00:56.910> were<00:00:57.060> starting<00:00:57.330> from

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
straight away that we were starting from

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.510 
straight away that we were starting from
the<00:00:57.690> starter<00:00:58.110> just<00:00:58.290> felt<00:00:58.860> nothing<00:00:59.070> like<00:00:59.370> the

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
the starter just felt nothing like the

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.330 
the starter just felt nothing like the
LA<00:00:59.670> bike<00:01:00.060> and<00:01:00.360> and<00:01:00.570> so<00:01:01.440> you<00:01:01.830> know<00:01:01.860> we<00:01:02.070> started

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
LA bike and and so you know we started

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.610 
LA bike and and so you know we started
working<00:01:02.580> and<00:01:03.090> I<00:01:03.120> guess<00:01:04.020> to<00:01:04.140> give<00:01:04.290> people<00:01:04.440> a

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:04.620 
working and I guess to give people a

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.330 
working and I guess to give people a
generalization<00:01:05.250> of<00:01:05.670> of<00:01:06.770> you<00:01:07.770> know<00:01:07.890> how<00:01:08.040> things

Superbike<00:02:23.130> lap<00:02:23.670> in<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.000> race<00:02:24.450> so<00:02:25.200> i<00:02:25.230> think

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
Superbike lap in the race so i think

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.170 
Superbike lap in the race so i think
twenty<00:02:25.680> five<00:02:25.920> six<00:02:26.280> or<00:02:26.400> seven<00:02:26.730> was<00:02:26.880> quickest

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
twenty five six or seven was quickest

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.410 
twenty five six or seven was quickest
this<00:02:27.330> year<00:02:27.599> i<00:02:27.780> believe<00:02:28.370> 2035<00:02:29.370> was<00:02:30.030> quickest

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
this year i believe 2035 was quickest

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.930 
this year i believe 2035 was quickest
last<00:02:30.690> year<00:02:30.959> or<00:02:31.110> 20<00:02:31.260> mar<00:02:31.620> 22<00:02:31.920> 23<00:02:32.580> seven

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
last year or 20 mar 22 23 seven

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.280 
last year or 20 mar 22 23 seven
something<00:02:33.180> like<00:02:33.270> that<00:02:33.390> so<00:02:33.540> with<00:02:33.720> two<00:02:33.870> seconds

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
something like that so with two seconds

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.230 
something like that so with two seconds
off<00:02:34.380> they're<00:02:34.650> right<00:02:35.220> here<00:02:35.250> now<00:02:35.790> we're<00:02:35.849> about

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
off they're right here now we're about

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.150 
off they're right here now we're about
two<00:02:36.510> seconds<00:02:36.900> off<00:02:37.020> but<00:02:37.319> that's

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
two seconds off but that's

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.770 
two seconds off but that's
understandable<00:02:38.370> here<00:02:39.150> we<00:02:39.240> don't<00:02:39.360> have<00:02:39.569> long

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
understandable here we don't have long

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.480 
understandable here we don't have long
straights<00:02:40.170> where<00:02:40.440> the<00:02:40.530> Superbike<00:02:40.950> really<00:02:41.310> can

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
straights where the Superbike really can

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.720 
straights where the Superbike really can
show<00:02:41.670> its<00:02:41.849> legs<00:02:42.120> and<00:02:42.330> really<00:02:42.599> show<00:02:42.780> its<00:02:42.959> talk

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
show its legs and really show its talk

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.850 
show its legs and really show its talk
we<00:02:44.730> have<00:02:44.849> a<00:02:44.880> lot<00:02:45.120> of<00:02:45.150> turns<00:02:45.510> here<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:46.319> 17-inch

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
we have a lot of turns here the 17-inch

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.470 
we have a lot of turns here the 17-inch
wheels<00:02:46.980> they're<00:02:47.670> a<00:02:47.700> little<00:02:47.849> bit<00:02:48.000> nicer<00:02:48.209> from

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
wheels they're a little bit nicer from

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.839 
wheels they're a little bit nicer from
side<00:02:48.750> to<00:02:48.930> side<00:02:48.959> so<00:02:49.500> I<00:02:49.680> wouldn't<00:02:50.250> be<00:02:50.280> surprised

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
side to side so I wouldn't be surprised

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:52.670 
side to side so I wouldn't be surprised
by<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:51.239> end<00:02:51.480> of<00:02:51.569> tomorrow<00:02:51.810> if<00:02:52.290> we're<00:02:52.470> not

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
by the end of tomorrow if we're not

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.040 
by the end of tomorrow if we're not
nudging<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.760> old<00:02:53.940> Superbike<00:02:54.510> time<00:02:54.810> do<00:02:55.020> I

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
nudging the old Superbike time do I

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.150 
nudging the old Superbike time do I
think<00:02:55.290> we're<00:02:55.410> going<00:02:55.530> to<00:02:55.620> get<00:02:55.709> in<00:02:55.800> front<00:02:55.980> of<00:02:56.069> the

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
think we're going to get in front of the

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.790 
think we're going to get in front of the
old<00:02:56.250> suit<00:02:56.459> by<00:02:56.580> time<00:02:56.790> no<00:02:57.090> i<00:02:57.120> don't<00:02:57.540> i<00:02:58.290> think<00:02:58.680> we

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
old suit by time no i don't i think we

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.830 
old suit by time no i don't i think we
can<00:02:58.920> nudge<00:02:59.430> up<00:02:59.640> against<00:02:59.940> it<00:03:00.090> though<00:03:00.240> and<00:03:00.540> I

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
can nudge up against it though and I

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.000 
can nudge up against it though and I
we're<00:03:00.989> going<00:03:01.110> to<00:03:01.170> get<00:03:01.260> close<00:03:01.500> there<00:03:01.769> so

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
we're going to get close there so

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.250 
we're going to get close there so
somewhere<00:03:02.670> within<00:03:03.060> the<00:03:03.269> two-second<00:03:03.840> vicinity

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
somewhere within the two-second vicinity

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.500 
somewhere within the two-second vicinity
to<00:03:04.290> go<00:03:04.560> in<00:03:05.489> the<00:03:05.580> next<00:03:05.700> day<00:03:05.910> and<00:03:06.000> a<00:03:06.060> half<00:03:06.269> and<00:03:06.420> I

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
to go in the next day and a half and I

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.630 
to go in the next day and a half and I
think<00:03:06.720> we<00:03:06.780> should<00:03:06.810> be<00:03:07.019> pretty<00:03:07.230> happy<00:03:07.519> do<00:03:08.519> you

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
think we should be pretty happy do you

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.210 
think we should be pretty happy do you
think<00:03:09.000> ultimately<00:03:09.209> with<00:03:09.959> the<00:03:10.170> new<00:03:10.440> specs<00:03:11.040> on

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
think ultimately with the new specs on

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.640 
think ultimately with the new specs on
the<00:03:11.340> bikes<00:03:11.580> and<00:03:11.849> how<00:03:12.030> limited<00:03:12.629> the<00:03:13.140> equipment

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
the bikes and how limited the equipment

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.009 
the bikes and how limited the equipment
is<00:03:13.800> on<00:03:13.980> them<00:03:14.129> that<00:03:14.280> you<00:03:14.459> can<00:03:14.760> go<00:03:15.540> faster<00:03:15.989> than

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
is on them that you can go faster than

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.770 
is on them that you can go faster than
the<00:03:16.230> old<00:03:16.410> Superbike<00:03:17.010> times<00:03:17.280> no<00:03:17.879> I<00:03:17.910> I<00:03:18.330> don't

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
the old Superbike times no I I don't

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.059 
the old Superbike times no I I don't
think<00:03:19.049> so<00:03:19.230> I<00:03:19.260> just<00:03:19.590> died<00:03:20.030> it's<00:03:21.030> very<00:03:21.330> hard<00:03:21.660> to

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:22.069 
think so I just died it's very hard to

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:25.130 
think so I just died it's very hard to
say<00:03:23.209> definitely<00:03:24.209> not<00:03:24.450> because<00:03:24.840> it<00:03:25.019> all

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
say definitely not because it all

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.130 
say definitely not because it all
depends<00:03:25.440> on<00:03:25.560> what<00:03:25.680> num<00:03:25.890> lock<00:03:26.010> pizzas<00:03:26.430> as<00:03:26.610> well

it<00:03:53.549> was<00:03:53.640> hard<00:03:53.940> to<00:03:54.299> get<00:03:54.450> within<00:03:54.660> a<00:03:54.780> second<00:03:55.170> and<00:03:55.260> a

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
it was hard to get within a second and a

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:56.720 
it was hard to get within a second and a
half<00:03:55.319> of<00:03:55.799> what<00:03:55.980> I<00:03:56.010> did<00:03:56.190> at<00:03:56.280> the<00:03:56.340> start<00:03:56.400> of<00:03:56.670> the

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
half of what I did at the start of the

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.750 
half of what I did at the start of the
race<00:03:57.440> so<00:03:58.440> things<00:03:59.099> are<00:03:59.220> very<00:03:59.310> different<00:03:59.579> now

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
race so things are very different now

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.600 
race so things are very different now
the<00:04:00.180> races<00:04:00.420> are<00:04:00.599> shorter<00:04:01.079> wheel<00:04:02.040> size<00:04:02.340> is<00:04:02.579> a

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
the races are shorter wheel size is a

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.059 
the races are shorter wheel size is a
different<00:04:03.060> means<00:04:03.390> the<00:04:03.569> ties<00:04:03.829> possibly<00:04:04.829> can<00:04:04.980> be

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
different means the ties possibly can be

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:07.370 
different means the ties possibly can be
a<00:04:05.100> little<00:04:05.310> bit<00:04:05.430> softer<00:04:05.930> maybe<00:04:06.930> not<00:04:07.170> wear<00:04:07.350> out

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
a little bit softer maybe not wear out

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.590 
a little bit softer maybe not wear out
as<00:04:07.739> much<00:04:07.950> or<00:04:08.250> offer<00:04:08.700> a<00:04:08.850> little<00:04:09.030> bit<00:04:09.120> more<00:04:09.269> grip

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
as much or offer a little bit more grip

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.390 
as much or offer a little bit more grip
and<00:04:10.079> on<00:04:10.200> a<00:04:10.260> racetrack<00:04:10.470> like<00:04:10.829> this<00:04:10.980> a<00:04:11.190> little

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
and on a racetrack like this a little

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.830 
and on a racetrack like this a little
bit<00:04:11.609> of<00:04:11.700> grip<00:04:11.880> makes<00:04:12.120> a<00:04:12.239> big<00:04:12.420> deal<00:04:12.660> because

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
bit of grip makes a big deal because

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.120 
bit of grip makes a big deal because
you're<00:04:13.019> never<00:04:13.319> in<00:04:13.470> the<00:04:13.560> center<00:04:13.799> of<00:04:13.829> the<00:04:13.950> tie

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
you're never in the center of the tie

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.789 
you're never in the center of the tie
you're<00:04:14.400> always<00:04:14.609> on<00:04:14.760> the<00:04:14.850> side<00:04:15.060> so<00:04:15.810> you<00:04:16.289> know

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
you're always on the side so you know

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:17.930 
you're always on the side so you know
it'll<00:04:17.099> be<00:04:17.130> interesting<00:04:17.310> to<00:04:17.459> see<00:04:17.519> where<00:04:17.789> we<00:04:17.910> go

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
it'll be interesting to see where we go

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.900 
it'll be interesting to see where we go
i<00:04:18.090> think<00:04:19.079> from<00:04:19.169> a<00:04:19.260> consistency<00:04:19.919> basis<00:04:20.340> we<00:04:20.700> will

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
i think from a consistency basis we will

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.180 
i think from a consistency basis we will
be<00:04:21.060> quicker<00:04:21.570> I<00:04:21.900> think<00:04:22.590> the<00:04:22.680> lap<00:04:22.800> times<00:04:23.039> will<00:04:23.160> be

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
be quicker I think the lap times will be

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.680 
be quicker I think the lap times will be
tighter<00:04:23.490> throughout<00:04:23.970> the<00:04:24.090> race<00:04:24.270> here<00:04:24.510> than

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
tighter throughout the race here than

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.120 
tighter throughout the race here than
what<00:04:24.750> they've<00:04:24.960> normally<00:04:25.530> been<00:04:25.710> in<00:04:25.830> superb<00:04:25.979> I

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
what they've normally been in superb I

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.190 
what they've normally been in superb I
race<00:04:26.340> but<00:04:26.940> again<00:04:27.030> the<00:04:27.270> races<00:04:27.570> are<00:04:27.660> shorter<00:04:28.050> too

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.200 
race but again the races are shorter too

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.830 
race but again the races are shorter too
not<00:04:28.500> as<00:04:28.650> long<00:04:29.479> towards<00:04:30.479> the<00:04:30.570> end<00:04:30.599> of<00:04:30.720> the

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
not as long towards the end of the

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.170 
not as long towards the end of the
session<00:04:31.020> right<00:04:31.320> before<00:04:31.620> lunch<00:04:31.770> your<00:04:32.460> guys<00:04:32.669> put

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
session right before lunch your guys put

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.760 
session right before lunch your guys put
the<00:04:33.270> hammer<00:04:33.510> down<00:04:33.630> and<00:04:34.050> changed<00:04:34.500> out<00:04:34.740> the

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
the hammer down and changed out the

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.140 
the hammer down and changed out the
front<00:04:35.130> end<00:04:35.280> a<00:04:35.370> little<00:04:35.460> bit<00:04:35.669> I<00:04:35.700> guess<00:04:35.760> they<00:04:36.030> were

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
front end a little bit I guess they were

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:37.640 
front end a little bit I guess they were
changing<00:04:36.479> out<00:04:36.570> offsets<00:04:37.050> you<00:04:37.169> said<00:04:37.410> in<00:04:37.560> the

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
changing out offsets you said in the

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.830 
changing out offsets you said in the
long<00:04:37.830> corner<00:04:38.280> so<00:04:38.400> I<00:04:38.430> guess<00:04:38.580> the<00:04:38.729> carousel<00:04:39.270> the

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
long corner so I guess the carousel the

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.540 
long corner so I guess the carousel the
bike<00:04:40.020> wanted<00:04:40.410> to<00:04:40.500> stand<00:04:40.770> up<00:04:41.010> you<00:04:41.160> said<00:04:41.370> and

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
bike wanted to stand up you said and

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.969 
bike wanted to stand up you said and
Peter<00:04:42.419> said<00:04:42.660> I<00:04:42.690> this<00:04:43.020> should<00:04:43.139> fix<00:04:43.289> it<00:04:43.440> yeah

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:43.979 
Peter said I this should fix it yeah

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:47.330 
Peter said I this should fix it yeah
well<00:04:44.520> you<00:04:44.729> know<00:04:44.849> we<00:04:45.260> in<00:04:46.260> racing<00:04:46.800> we<00:04:46.950> have<00:04:47.160> our

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
well you know we in racing we have our

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.719 
well you know we in racing we have our
theories<00:04:48.000> that<00:04:48.360> we<00:04:48.690> believe<00:04:49.340> from<00:04:50.340> the<00:04:50.490> past

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:50.729 
theories that we believe from the past

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:53.659 
theories that we believe from the past
make<00:04:51.539> certain<00:04:51.810> things<00:04:52.139> happen<00:04:52.669> motorcycles

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:53.669 
make certain things happen motorcycles

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:56.089 
make certain things happen motorcycles
have<00:04:53.760> changed<00:04:54.210> so<00:04:54.389> much<00:04:54.630> though<00:04:54.930> even<00:04:55.470> in<00:04:55.620> you

00:04:56.089 --> 00:04:56.099 
have changed so much though even in you

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:57.589 
have changed so much though even in you
know<00:04:56.220> the<00:04:56.490> time<00:04:56.700> i'll<00:04:56.910> be<00:04:57.030> in<00:04:57.090> professional

00:04:57.589 --> 00:04:57.599 
know the time i'll be in professional

00:04:57.599 --> 00:04:59.420 
know the time i'll be in professional
racing<00:04:57.810> a<00:04:57.990> motorcycle<00:04:58.560> a<00:04:58.650> road<00:04:59.220> bike

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
racing a motorcycle a road bike

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.969 
racing a motorcycle a road bike
professionally<00:05:00.000> for<00:05:00.419> 17<00:05:00.870> years<00:05:01.139> in<00:05:01.440> the<00:05:01.800> last

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:01.979 
professionally for 17 years in the last

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:03.620 
professionally for 17 years in the last
17<00:05:02.340> years<00:05:02.370> motorcycles<00:05:03.060> changed<00:05:03.330> so<00:05:03.450> much<00:05:03.570> in

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
17 years motorcycles changed so much in

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.960 
17 years motorcycles changed so much in
that<00:05:03.780> time<00:05:04.110> that<00:05:04.349> things<00:05:05.220> don't<00:05:05.460> always<00:05:05.700> work

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
that time that things don't always work

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:07.909 
that time that things don't always work
the<00:05:06.389> same<00:05:06.570> as<00:05:06.750> what<00:05:06.840> they<00:05:07.020> may<00:05:07.200> have<00:05:07.229> back<00:05:07.650> then

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 
the same as what they may have back then

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:10.219 
the same as what they may have back then
or<00:05:08.130> even<00:05:08.370> five<00:05:08.610> or<00:05:08.760> ten<00:05:08.909> years<00:05:08.940> ago<00:05:09.270> so<00:05:09.690> in

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:10.229 
or even five or ten years ago so in

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:12.409 
or even five or ten years ago so in
theory<00:05:10.560> we<00:05:10.740> changed<00:05:11.370> an<00:05:11.550> offset<00:05:11.940> to<00:05:11.969> try<00:05:12.270> and

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:12.419 
theory we changed an offset to try and

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:13.790 
theory we changed an offset to try and
get<00:05:12.539> something<00:05:13.169> to<00:05:13.200> happen

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
get something to happen

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.619 
get something to happen
and<00:05:15.020> we<00:05:16.020> definitely<00:05:16.770> found<00:05:17.669> something<00:05:18.300> there

00:05:18.619 --> 00:05:18.629 
and we definitely found something there

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:22.730 
and we definitely found something there
but<00:05:19.340> you<00:05:20.340> know<00:05:20.460> things<00:05:20.909> don't<00:05:21.180> we<00:05:21.720> have<00:05:22.379> as<00:05:22.590> I

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
but you know things don't we have as I

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:23.990 
but you know things don't we have as I
said<00:05:22.919> we<00:05:23.039> have<00:05:23.159> all<00:05:23.310> these<00:05:23.430> theories<00:05:23.699> and<00:05:23.909> all

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 
said we have all these theories and all

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.610 
said we have all these theories and all
these<00:05:24.120> things<00:05:24.180> on<00:05:24.509> paper<00:05:24.690> that<00:05:25.020> have<00:05:25.379> worked

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
these things on paper that have worked

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.950 
these things on paper that have worked
in<00:05:25.770> the<00:05:25.860> past<00:05:26.039> you<00:05:26.909> can't<00:05:27.150> rely<00:05:27.479> on<00:05:27.509> everything

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 
in the past you can't rely on everything

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.110 
in the past you can't rely on everything
all<00:05:28.620> the<00:05:28.919> time<00:05:28.949> for<00:05:29.400> the<00:05:29.490> future<00:05:29.849> you<00:05:29.970> know

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
all the time for the future you know

things change motorcycles change tires

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:34.550 
things change motorcycles change tires
change<00:05:33.180> I<00:05:33.479> mean<00:05:33.780> the<00:05:33.870> lean<00:05:34.050> angle<00:05:34.379> of<00:05:34.470> a

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
change I mean the lean angle of a

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.820 
change I mean the lean angle of a
motorcycle<00:05:34.860> now<00:05:36.229> with<00:05:37.229> the<00:05:37.379> group<00:05:37.620> that's

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
motorcycle now with the group that's

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.529 
motorcycle now with the group that's
often<00:05:38.099> now<00:05:38.220> by<00:05:38.400> the<00:05:38.460> tires<00:05:38.729> compared<00:05:39.180> to<00:05:39.270> 20

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:39.539 
often now by the tires compared to 20

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:41.600 
often now by the tires compared to 20
years<00:05:39.720> ago<00:05:39.900> is<00:05:40.169> phenomenal<00:05:40.770> so<00:05:41.039> at<00:05:41.430> the

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 
years ago is phenomenal so at the

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:43.100 
years ago is phenomenal so at the
straightaway<00:05:42.030> things<00:05:42.360> are<00:05:42.509> changing<00:05:42.990> you

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.110 
straightaway things are changing you

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:44.779 
straightaway things are changing you
know<00:05:43.139> I<00:05:43.259> mean<00:05:43.500> so<00:05:43.710> you've<00:05:44.190> got<00:05:44.340> to<00:05:44.430> go<00:05:44.550> with<00:05:44.699> the

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:44.789 
know I mean so you've got to go with the

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:46.459 
know I mean so you've got to go with the
width<00:05:45.210> times<00:05:45.539> and<00:05:45.870> you've<00:05:45.960> got<00:05:46.199> to<00:05:46.319> roll<00:05:46.440> with

00:05:46.459 --> 00:05:46.469 
width times and you've got to roll with

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:48.499 
width times and you've got to roll with
the<00:05:46.590> punches<00:05:46.949> and<00:05:47.129> and<00:05:47.699> when<00:05:48.180> you<00:05:48.300> make<00:05:48.449> a

00:05:48.499 --> 00:05:48.509 
the punches and and when you make a

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:51.469 
the punches and and when you make a
change<00:05:48.599> you've<00:05:49.169> got<00:05:49.289> to<00:05:49.379> not<00:05:50.030> put<00:05:51.030> it<00:05:51.120> in<00:05:51.240> here

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:51.479 
change you've got to not put it in here

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:54.589 
change you've got to not put it in here
that<00:05:51.780> it's<00:05:52.530> better<00:05:52.800> before<00:05:53.669> you<00:05:53.759> roll<00:05:53.940> out<00:05:54.000> you

00:05:54.589 --> 00:05:54.599 
that it's better before you roll out you

00:05:54.599 --> 00:05:56.149 
that it's better before you roll out you
gotta<00:05:54.750> let<00:05:54.840> the<00:05:54.930> stopwatch<00:05:55.289> tell<00:05:55.560> you<00:05:55.740> and<00:05:55.979> how

00:05:56.149 --> 00:05:56.159 
gotta let the stopwatch tell you and how

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:59.540 
gotta let the stopwatch tell you and how
you<00:05:56.219> feel<00:05:56.610> on<00:05:56.639> the<00:05:56.849> motorcycle<00:05:57.360> as<00:05:57.449> well<00:05:58.550> then

00:05:59.540 --> 00:05:59.550 
you feel on the motorcycle as well then

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:02.390 
you feel on the motorcycle as well then
I<00:05:59.849> came<00:06:00.659> around<00:06:00.840> the<00:06:01.020> corner<00:06:01.800> and<00:06:02.009> you<00:06:02.219> were

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 
I came around the corner and you were

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.040 
I came around the corner and you were
making<00:06:03.090> a<00:06:03.150> finishing<00:06:03.419> up<00:06:03.539> a<00:06:03.599> change<00:06:03.840> to<00:06:03.960> the

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.050 
making a finishing up a change to the

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:05.270 
making a finishing up a change to the
rear<00:06:04.199> of<00:06:04.229> the<00:06:04.319> bike<00:06:04.440> and<00:06:04.650> it<00:06:04.740> looked<00:06:04.949> like<00:06:05.069> you

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.280 
rear of the bike and it looked like you

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.219 
rear of the bike and it looked like you
were<00:06:05.400> working<00:06:05.879> with<00:06:05.909> linkage<00:06:06.479> and<00:06:06.750> Peter

00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:07.229 
were working with linkage and Peter

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:08.600 
were working with linkage and Peter
pointed<00:06:07.590> something<00:06:07.770> out<00:06:07.979> with<00:06:08.190> the<00:06:08.280> linkage

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:08.610 
pointed something out with the linkage

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:10.100 
pointed something out with the linkage
and<00:06:08.789> before<00:06:09.060> you<00:06:09.090> said<00:06:09.360> on<00:06:09.479> the<00:06:09.509> 08<00:06:09.810> you<00:06:09.900> hadn't

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:10.110 
and before you said on the 08 you hadn't

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:11.839 
and before you said on the 08 you hadn't
done<00:06:10.139> any<00:06:10.379> of<00:06:10.530> that<00:06:10.560> so<00:06:10.889> that's<00:06:11.430> something<00:06:11.639> you

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:11.849 
done any of that so that's something you

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:13.219 
done any of that so that's something you
can<00:06:11.940> start<00:06:12.060> playing<00:06:12.270> with<00:06:12.389> now<00:06:12.569> I<00:06:12.810> think

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:13.229 
can start playing with now I think

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:15.050 
can start playing with now I think
probably<00:06:13.889> one<00:06:14.129> of<00:06:14.159> our<00:06:14.280> conversations<00:06:14.940> in

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:15.060 
probably one of our conversations in

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:16.790 
probably one of our conversations in
Atlanta<00:06:15.419> we<00:06:15.509> spoke<00:06:15.780> about<00:06:15.900> the<00:06:16.110> 08<00:06:16.379> and<00:06:16.590> how

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:16.800
