 the galaxy youtube complaints 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:10.019
 Today I'll show you how 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:14.610
 make Mont blanc more realistic because 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:17.190
 When you love klaus, which is not much. 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.359
 realistic as in the amapÃ¡ is in this case 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.930
 anyway 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:26.430
 The hotel goes on head is not it? 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.779
 I'll show you here how to leave. 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.579
 more realistic 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:35.730
 you go what options clicks on performance 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.969
 the cash box that is made from the visit goes 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.629
 to activate or uncheck stays in 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.629
 Confirm 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.989
 ready now it will get more realistic 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.960
 because when you go to play is when the 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:55.860
 guy was dying he will type and daruma 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:59.609
 He is going to give us a bottle. 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:03.090
 after him after he falls and is 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:05.339
 so more realistic because I thought that 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.790
 it was until today I thought it was a bug, right? 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:11.520
 this business that covers the foot and the 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.909
 I thought it was a bug 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:19.590
 but then I learned that it was not me 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:23.220
 It brought me this way there to help you. 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.560
 They 'll never help you get out with 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:31.770
 would make it more realistic not 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:37.430

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:41.130

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:45.329
