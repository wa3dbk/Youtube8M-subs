00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:08.160
 Hi everyone interested in charging 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:13.040
 here it comes in such here 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:19.640
 the packaging is in it 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:19.640
 controller charging 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:27.800
 bimini from metro adapter usb to 10 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:33.369
 different connectors any phone can 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.369
 plug in and even charging itself 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.420
 closes on velcro 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:45.199
 unfolds from four separate 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:48.829
 panel material nylon good good 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:51.769
 no claim no parvati oh 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:55.790
 pretty still need to try 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:56.799
 even nowhere sticks out every single one 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.140
 panels 

00:00:56.799 --> 00:01:01.390
 sealed with a film which in principle 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:06.280
 can play 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.280
 herself here is exceptional for protection 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:17.020
 rather thin that is where the 4 well 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.020
 maximum 5 millimeters 1 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:27.560
 so let's see how it works 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:30.890
 it means you can connect directly that is 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.890
 so here 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:40.370
 either through the controller that is in the middle 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:50.000
 another controller is turned on 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.000
 adapter so he 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.470
 it is necessary in all cases when necessary 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:02.170
 charge some 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:05.350
 sophisticated technology like ipod well or what 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.270
 something like when I need a charge current 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:12.040
 more than 300 miles im pepper with this 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:14.620
 the controller cuts off the excess when not 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.230
 You need to order two phones 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:21.300
 simultaneous even three but subject 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:27.340
 when the sun is strong that is like now 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:29.380
 here it lies under the direct rays of it 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:34.450
 more than enough to charge 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:36.900
 phone for clarity, you can still 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.900
 connect the phone that's here 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.900
 showed 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.680
 to demonstrate 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.860
 and work 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.800
 one hand is not convenient you sorry 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.489
 charging went 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:47.190
 this way it works 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.080
 very handy thing for fishermen and 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:54.270
 hunters 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:55.490
 people who want to go hiking in 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:58.140
 principle 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:01.220
 any person will be a useful thing on 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:06.920
 kebabs somewhere out in nature 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:10.310
 when do you need to charge a coin from where 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.310
 thanks to all
