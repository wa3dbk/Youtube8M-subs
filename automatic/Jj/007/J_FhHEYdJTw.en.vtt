oh<00:01:37.060> here's<00:01:38.060> some<00:01:40.210> what<00:01:41.210> happened<00:01:45.310> before

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.280 

a<00:01:57.909> different<00:01:58.909> component<00:01:59.360> and<00:01:59.540> not<00:01:59.750> ground<00:02:00.110> the

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
a different component and not ground the

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:01.960 
a different component and not ground the
whole<00:02:00.439> part<00:02:00.770> so<00:02:01.100> it<00:02:01.189> makes<00:02:01.340> more<00:02:01.520> sense<00:02:01.580> you

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
whole part so it makes more sense you

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.399 
whole part so it makes more sense you
can<00:02:02.119> make<00:02:02.240> these<00:02:02.360> tighter<00:02:02.720> like<00:02:02.960> we<00:02:03.080> used<00:02:03.259> to

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
can make these tighter like we used to

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:05.140 
can make these tighter like we used to
but<00:02:03.860> then<00:02:04.070> you<00:02:04.369> have<00:02:04.490> to<00:02:04.580> ground<00:02:04.790> the<00:02:05.000> whole

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
but then you have to ground the whole

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:11.280 
but then you have to ground the whole
car<00:02:05.330> now<00:02:05.540> we<00:02:05.600> go

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290
