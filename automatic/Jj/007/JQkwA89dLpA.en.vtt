00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:57.240 
now since the last one was kind of like

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:01.580 
now since the last one was kind of like
a<00:06:57.300> Crouch<00:06:57.870> ish<00:06:58.340> shot<00:07:00.200> thought<00:07:01.200> I<00:07:01.230> seen<00:07:01.440> a<00:07:01.470> guy

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:01.590 
a Crouch ish shot thought I seen a guy

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:06.800 
a Crouch ish shot thought I seen a guy
over<00:07:01.710> there<00:07:03.500> I<00:07:05.210> don't<00:07:06.210> think<00:07:06.240> what's<00:07:06.450> my<00:07:06.540> kill

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:06.810 
over there I don't think what's my kill

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:10.280 
over there I don't think what's my kill
might<00:07:07.110> have<00:07:07.230> been<00:07:07.320> but<00:07:07.560> 21<00:07:08.460> and<00:07:08.610> 5<00:07:08.760> 5<00:07:09.420> 10<00:07:09.720> 15<00:07:10.140> 20

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:10.290 
might have been but 21 and 5 5 10 15 20

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:15.500 
might have been but 21 and 5 5 10 15 20
that's<00:07:11.250> at<00:07:11.490> least<00:07:11.520> a<00:07:11.730> four<00:07:12.230> awesome<00:07:14.510> alright

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:15.510 
that's at least a four awesome alright

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:17.000 
that's at least a four awesome alright
so<00:07:15.660> I<00:07:15.690> think<00:07:15.780> we<00:07:16.020> executed<00:07:16.530> that<00:07:16.590> challenge

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:17.010 
so I think we executed that challenge

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:18.950 
so I think we executed that challenge
pretty<00:07:17.220> well<00:07:17.400> even<00:07:18.330> though<00:07:18.420> some<00:07:18.780> of<00:07:18.870> the

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:18.960 
pretty well even though some of the

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.440 
pretty well even though some of the
kills<00:07:19.170> are<00:07:19.320> kind<00:07:19.500> of<00:07:19.530> like<00:07:19.770> a<00:07:20.180> little<00:07:21.180> awkward

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:21.450 
kills are kind of like a little awkward

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:23.900 
kills are kind of like a little awkward
because<00:07:21.840> it's<00:07:22.200> sometimes<00:07:22.560> tough<00:07:22.680> to<00:07:22.920> go<00:07:23.550> fully

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:23.910 
because it's sometimes tough to go fully

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:26.720 
because it's sometimes tough to go fully
prone<00:07:24.360> when<00:07:24.570> you're<00:07:24.690> in<00:07:24.780> mid<00:07:24.960> action<00:07:25.560> but<00:07:26.460> hey
