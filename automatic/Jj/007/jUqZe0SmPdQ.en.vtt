 horizontal are the investigation of children's books 

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:10.759
 all nonsense 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:12.139

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:14.199

 apart apart he warns hands about it 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.810

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:23.900
 not just that trade 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.900

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:29.849
 connery

 Everywhere in the Netherlands Jan Willem II x2 not happy a commander of the rebels 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.140
 can make something like that on goalkeeper 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.940
 and I think those plans 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.000
 cooled 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.040

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.289
 the first note attempted this to pick up that trade 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.380
 but small chances and possibilities 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.380
 just simply jallo 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.030
 run the device completely 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.870
 to have it converted, among other things 4 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.870
 to be able to do differently with the chip card 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.240
 justice 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.670
 anp adb already deceased in that position 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.850
 moreover the corpse of alcohol 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.980
 ever the obvious 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.980
 in the clear 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.120

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.330

 That is a building on the Peat moss testament purpose 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:17.659
 really works 

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:24.469
 and of which all have an eye for detail byzantine one 

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:31.689
 at the counter 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:38.619
 A beautiful story 

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:41.619

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:19.429

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.180
