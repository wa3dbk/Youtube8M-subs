00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:04.529
 more news in Spain are produced more than half a million tons a year 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.919
 of organic waste from catering and catering 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.490
 and more than 14 million tons of leftover materials from the industry 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.049
 There will be elementary support from next year these waste should 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.289
 collected separately for later reuse 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.390
 blue is a pilot plant is no longer used to produce biogas and energy 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.630
 electric 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.430
 the biogas pilot plant commissioned within the European project 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.819
 integral of 

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:34.820
 It is located next to the biodiesel production plant that the company 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.920
 gave the north have san martÃ­n del rey aurelio 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.950
 we must take advantage of biodiesel waste and chain waste 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:43.000
 food 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.950
 to produce mario gas the model that poses the lousy integral management 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.030
 to share the collection 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.940
 and also share the same installation 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.790
 the realization of this waste 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.310
 and in what we convert them because on the one hand the biodiesel the oil 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.870
 and not on the other hand biogas organic waste 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.160
 in this way we have two energy products with orality and make 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.590
 it is a fuel that vehicles are used 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.330
 and on the other hand we have biogas with which we can produce electricity if 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.950
 what we go in an engine 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.100
 the three-year project with a budget of almost one million and 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.140
 average of euros 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.620
 is funded by the program of the influential commission 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.520
 the biggest investment in when exposing the pilot plant 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.860
 of what is the production of biogas itself 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.530
 Noel is carrying it because he is really weighing his product that is not 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.940
 you have to pay for something that has no cost on the ball to the market 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.730
 and also these on the other hand generating electricity what 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.830
 you can take advantage of proposals that is biogas 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.940
 I am not, I would say, supplied on our own 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.030
 electricity produced by the engine 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.540
 fed with biogas 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.460
 the heat of the fire 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.310
 of the engine itself can be transferred to the Tamaulipas women of the plant 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.100
 as that supposes economic advantage 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.590
 as the economic sustain of the plant itself if the numbers come out as 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.290
 expected 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:13.010
 the Asturian company is already thinking of exporting its technology to install 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.280
 biogas plants next to biodiesel plants all over the world
