00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
tegmentum area and the superior yeah

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.429 
tegmentum area and the superior yeah
this<00:01:07.850> is<00:01:07.970> the<00:01:08.090> superior<00:01:08.450> colliculus<00:01:08.990> up<00:01:09.170> here

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 
this is the superior colliculus up here

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:12.190 
this is the superior colliculus up here
this<00:01:09.830> is<00:01:10.010> the<00:01:10.130> inferior<00:01:10.610> colliculus<00:01:11.200> superior

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
this is the inferior colliculus superior

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.300 
this is the inferior colliculus superior
colliculus<00:01:12.710> is<00:01:13.330> responsible<00:01:14.330> for<00:01:14.360> oxygen

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
colliculus is responsible for oxygen

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.920 
colliculus is responsible for oxygen
inferior<00:01:16.310> is<00:01:16.490> for<00:01:17.110> auditory<00:01:18.110> and<00:01:19.689> let's<00:01:20.689> see

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
inferior is for auditory and let's see

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.390 
inferior is for auditory and let's see
we'll<00:01:21.259> go<00:01:21.350> through<00:01:21.530> the<00:01:21.650> ventricles<00:01:22.100> I<00:01:22.220> guess

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
we'll go through the ventricles I guess

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.060 
we'll go through the ventricles I guess
this<00:01:22.790> is<00:01:22.970> the<00:01:23.090> fourth<00:01:23.330> ventricle<00:01:23.540> here<00:01:24.409> it's

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
this is the fourth ventricle here it's

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:32.920 
this is the fourth ventricle here it's
going<00:01:25.820> through<00:01:26.090> the<00:01:31.570> that's<00:01:32.570> not<00:01:32.750> that

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
going through the that's not that

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.650 
going through the that's not that
important<00:01:34.840> part<00:01:35.840> we're<00:01:36.200> gonna<00:01:36.320> get

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:38.660 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:44.960 

oh<00:01:42.170> yeah<00:01:43.170> that's<00:01:43.440> the<00:01:43.650> aqueduct<00:01:44.490> of<00:01:44.580> sylvius

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
oh yeah that's the aqueduct of sylvius

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.930 
oh yeah that's the aqueduct of sylvius
area<00:01:45.360> akka<00:01:46.170> dr.<00:01:46.560> Sylvius<00:01:46.920> leading<00:01:47.280> into<00:01:47.730> the

right<00:02:42.360> here<00:02:42.690> that's<00:02:42.900> going<00:02:43.290> across<00:02:43.470> the

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
right here that's going across the

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.710 
right here that's going across the
occipital<00:02:44.970> is<00:02:45.380> the<00:02:46.380> calcarine<00:02:46.950> sulcus<00:02:47.720> above

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
occipital is the calcarine sulcus above

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.040 
occipital is the calcarine sulcus above
the<00:02:48.900> calcarine<00:02:49.230> sulcus<00:02:49.380> like<00:02:50.130> the<00:02:50.370> Kunis

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
the calcarine sulcus like the Kunis

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.570 
the calcarine sulcus like the Kunis
below<00:02:52.050> the<00:02:52.230> calcarine<00:02:52.590> sulcus<00:02:52.769> is<00:02:53.250> the

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
below the calcarine sulcus is the

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.130 
below the calcarine sulcus is the
lingual<00:02:54.000> gyrus<00:02:54.030> my<00:02:54.900> view<00:02:55.290> is<00:02:56.280> it<00:02:56.610> is<00:02:57.480> there

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
lingual gyrus my view is it is there

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.380 
lingual gyrus my view is it is there
anything<00:02:58.320> else<00:02:58.560> that<00:02:58.890> we<00:02:59.489> owe<00:03:02.209> foramen<00:03:03.209> of

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
anything else that we owe foramen of

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.860 
anything else that we owe foramen of
Monro<00:03:03.720> it's<00:03:04.260> right<00:03:04.890> here<00:03:05.400> it's<00:03:06.180> going<00:03:06.690> through

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
Monro it's right here it's going through

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.940 
Monro it's right here it's going through
basically<00:03:07.410> that's<00:03:08.130> in<00:03:08.519> there<00:03:08.730> ah<00:03:09.650> we<00:03:10.650> covered

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
basically that's in there ah we covered

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.310 
basically that's in there ah we covered
everything<00:03:11.160> Mike<00:03:11.610> did<00:03:11.760> you<00:03:11.820> get<00:03:11.970> that<00:03:12.120> oh<00:03:12.360> yeah

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
everything Mike did you get that oh yeah

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.970 
everything Mike did you get that oh yeah
I<00:03:13.350> got<00:03:13.650> it<00:03:15.380> couldn't<00:03:16.380> get<00:03:16.440> any<00:03:16.500> better<00:03:16.680> than

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
I got it couldn't get any better than

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.330 
I got it couldn't get any better than
that<00:03:17.040> I<00:03:17.459> get<00:03:18.120> to<00:03:18.239> go
