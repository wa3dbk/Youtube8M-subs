00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.930
 to change the name to mean 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.690
 fire I did not get it ok 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:34.970
 so good and once the subject is extracted 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.850
 we are going to give right click and extract 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:41.000
 here you have to have winrar to 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.860

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.050
 this file will be fine 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.620
 we are simply going to open the 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:52.740
 folder and we will be offered four 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.720
 folders and a theme file 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.970
 well the first thing we have to do 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.980
 is she like you do not know if you already have 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.229
 know I think they have to know how to copy 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:05.780
 all files with control or click 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:08.649
 right and copy ok copy here 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:12.830
 and they go to the next lesson that is 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:15.800
 Windows team resolve is what this 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.440
 windows of this computer windows is the 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:21.680
 results is it is ok I'm going to open it 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.110
 from a shortcut that you think is 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.070
 this one here 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.690
 and well, here they will offer us this 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.400
 the topics that we have installed him 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.890
 let's hit 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.290
 I think this is because I already know 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.390
 I had stuck here I'm going to give cancel 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.270
 you do not disappear anything you 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.430
 tell them they will copy in the paste or that 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.590
 they close the window and well once done 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.050
 that gives you a right click to the desktop and 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.330
 personalize 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:52.360
 if he was going to appear is the window of 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:57.640
 personalization they will look for the name 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:03:00.630
 that says wind blend 2.0 top rank 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.630
 select 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.230
 okay 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.990
 it reads this is the subject as they see me not 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.220
 I change a lot to me 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:15.460
 why would they say this 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.980
 the theme file 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.900
 this the issue does not come with any blow 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.760
 but so that you will have to 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.310
 put a wallpaper since you 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.260
 want in this case and well 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.880
 you can customize it by changing 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.520
 what color and so they want it 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:33.530
 transparent because you know they enable it 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.900
 up here says the here 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.020
 to leave it transparent if I want it 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.910
 in red in red if they want it in coffee 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:44.770
 blue and good what I like this topic 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.770
 is that then later you see this the 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:51.370
 there is no effect of color ok 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.700
 so they change color and they put it 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.680
 in the world by see what you want 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.120
 me in my previous idea in a video 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.860
 previous I had already left a pack of 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.659

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:09.700
 once they have this system already 

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:13.720

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:15.370
