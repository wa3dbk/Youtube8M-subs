00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:09.450
 hello everyone today on our review 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:11.160
 this portable charger 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.670
 with which you can charge 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.990
 mobile phones, cameras and other 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:22.340
 portable mobile devices 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:27.260
 I deliberately did not wipe it 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:31.650
 polish for you to see how 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:35.280
 this charge looks later somewhere 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:39.450
 year and a half of use on shabby 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.399
 on the slapped actually think also 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.840
 it will look and you will not looking 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:50.789
 what comes in the box 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:53.010
 Here is the cover in which it is removed when 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.629
 we don't use it or even when 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:01.280
 use we can here with the help 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:05.309
 yusbi cord to stick it tighten and 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.299
 despite the fact that the charger device 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.760
 is in the case 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:15.210
 we can still charge our phone 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:18.080
 The capacity of this charger is 4000 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.080
 milliamps per hour 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:27.060
 battery capacity on my mobile 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:32.150
 samsung galaxy s4 phone somewhere now 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:41.670
 I'll look at the spare battery capacity 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:42.689
 we have batteries as you see 2600 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.369
 milliamps per hour 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:50.880
 thus it tells us that we 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.530
 can charge our phone with 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.590
 this charger is practically 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.020
 twice 2 times 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.820
 Full-fledged incomplete phone days 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.979
 to get infected is not completely but nevertheless 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.469
 almost i think percent on 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:09.080
 eighty five he charged 

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:12.430
 as I said the case is complete with 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:17.569
 This charger comes with a case and 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:23.239
 Here is such a convenient charging cord 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:28.790
 who is stuck directly beating 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:33.730
 move on the charger and on the other 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.730
 here we have an interface 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:42.099
 second don't want to focus now 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:56.390
 Here is an interface for charging iphone 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:59.120
 for the insertion of such here 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.879
 bit 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:05.659
 in this case in my hand lies 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:08.010
 adapter to micro usb 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:12.329
 because we phone is charging with 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:17.459
 help nonetheless with 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:24.299
 our own still an adapter to mini usb 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:25.260
 and tramps just in case my brother 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:35.159
 iphone 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:39.930
 i wear iphone adapter so all this 

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:45.359
 This here looks like a little thing I already 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:48.139
 screwed himself for convenience, you never know where 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:52.260
 it may be necessary 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:52.829
 manufacturer of this charger 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.650
 China 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:57.930
 but despite the fact that these china are quite 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.280
 themselves work cheerfully and stated four 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:03.599
 thousand milliamps an hour 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:05.400
 is really the same on this 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:09.030
 the charger has an indicator 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:14.940
 the charge of this device that is when u 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:17.150
 we are lit all four light bulbs it 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.289
 means charged one hundred percent 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:22.919
 respectively each lamp 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:23.479
 this is 25 percent charge remaining in 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:27.150
 battery 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:27.659
 Well, I'll try to show you how 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.199
 looks like 

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:33.680
 directly charging second I will say for 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:33.680
 phone 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:46.970
 So here it is, we stick the phone in and 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:58.740
 turn on all the phone went charging 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:03.020
 enough as I said almost on 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.020
 charge twice 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:13.920
 when transferring, I fold it 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:22.200
 case also in this case I throw 

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:24.840
 flowers tighten it in a bag and tidy 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:26.580
 I also put the lace separately because 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.100
 this lace can be used simply 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:32.930
 to connect a computer phone 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.930
 for example for trash some data 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:38.730
 and data can be reset 

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:41.760
 not only from my phone but also from iphone 

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:45.240
 and from any device where 

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:47.630
 not micro less beaten because by itself 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:51.810
 I wear these three adapters 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:53.490
 I would recommend for a city in 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:56.790
 use and the campaign can take 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:06:00.230
 The only thing is that of course the capacity 

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:03.720
 not enough by the way he is light he 

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:07.110
 easy enough you can clean yourself in 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:11.010
 hike unfortunately in the characteristics i don't 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:15.710
 I see the stated weight and weights so 

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:21.050
 same yes yes he charges 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:21.050
 here through this red entrance 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:42.480
 then using a normal 220 adapter 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:45.060
 volt which has the following here itself 

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:50.880
 the adapter that came with it I 

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:53.130
 I still use it to this day 

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:55.410
 Here I recommend the charger to everyone 

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:59.910
 so that at the wrong moment does not 

00:06:55.410 --> 00:07:03.570
 remain without phone just as you have 

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:06.570
 understood our extra 

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:09.810
 spare battery charged 

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:13.290
 I guarantee that at the right moment I am not 

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:15.240
 stay without communication will not stay without cards 

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:20.430
 I mean 

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:23.910
 maps of the area in the end always 

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:27.320
 I can watch some movie on it 

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:34.640
 device is not afraid to discharge the battery 

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:34.640
 all all the best
