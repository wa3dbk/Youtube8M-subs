00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
starting block is where you should begin

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.069 
starting block is where you should begin
and<00:00:41.370> that<00:00:41.579> will<00:00:41.760> instantly<00:00:42.420> start<00:00:42.899> earning

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
and that will instantly start earning

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.549 
and that will instantly start earning
your<00:00:43.230> money<00:00:43.530> on<00:00:43.800> an<00:00:43.920> hourly<00:00:44.280> basis<00:00:45.320> so<00:00:46.320> if<00:00:46.379> we

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
your money on an hourly basis so if we

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.580 
your money on an hourly basis so if we
head<00:00:46.890> on<00:00:46.920> over<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:48.000> store

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.590 
head on over to the store

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.799 
head on over to the store
and<00:00:51.129> as<00:00:51.250> you<00:00:51.370> can<00:00:51.460> see<00:00:51.520> I'm<00:00:51.910> driving<00:00:52.149> probably

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809 
and as you can see I'm driving probably

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:55.709 
and as you can see I'm driving probably
one<00:00:52.930> of<00:00:52.960> the<00:00:53.140> best<00:00:53.289> tractors<00:00:53.800> in<00:00:53.980> the<00:00:54.100> game<00:00:54.719> you

00:00:55.709 --> 00:00:55.719 
one of the best tractors in the game you

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:57.689 
one of the best tractors in the game you
can<00:00:55.780> see<00:00:55.989> my<00:00:56.140> bank<00:00:56.350> balance<00:00:56.769> is<00:00:56.920> about<00:00:57.219> 18

00:00:57.689 --> 00:00:57.699 
can see my bank balance is about 18

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:00.869 
can see my bank balance is about 18
million<00:00:58.180> approaching<00:00:59.140> 19<00:00:59.649> million<00:00:59.980> that's

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879 
million approaching 19 million that's

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:03.630 
million approaching 19 million that's
more<00:01:01.239> than<00:01:01.449> enough<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:02.680> retire<00:01:03.100> from<00:01:03.430> the

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
more than enough to retire from the

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.570 
more than enough to retire from the
farming<00:01:04.180> business<00:01:07.920> so<00:01:08.920> basically<00:01:09.220> we'll<00:01:09.460> go

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
farming business so basically we'll go

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.399 
farming business so basically we'll go
to<00:01:09.640> the<00:01:09.880> store<00:01:10.180> and<00:01:11.940> enroute<00:01:12.940> you'll<00:01:13.899> see<00:01:14.140> my

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 
to the store and enroute you'll see my

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:17.340 
to the store and enroute you'll see my
handiwork<00:01:14.830> that<00:01:15.580> I've<00:01:15.790> dedicated<00:01:16.690> this

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
handiwork that I've dedicated this

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.190 
handiwork that I've dedicated this
section<00:01:17.770> of<00:01:17.890> the<00:01:17.940> terrain<00:01:18.940> to<00:01:19.180> my<00:01:19.390> powerplant

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
section of the terrain to my powerplant

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:28.600 
section of the terrain to my powerplant
solar<00:01:20.649> panels<00:01:21.159> and<00:01:21.399> wind<00:01:22.210> turbine<00:01:22.960> generators

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.360 

quite<00:01:29.240> a<00:01:29.270> lot<00:01:29.510> of<00:01:29.630> them<00:01:29.810> just<00:01:30.020> taken<00:01:30.500> a<00:01:30.560> you

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:31.370 
quite a lot of them just taken a you

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:32.620 
quite a lot of them just taken a you
know<00:01:31.490> quite<00:01:31.700> a<00:01:31.730> bit<00:01:31.820> of<00:01:32.000> time<00:01:32.210> to<00:01:32.420> sort<00:01:32.570> of

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
know quite a bit of time to sort of

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.560 
know quite a bit of time to sort of
build<00:01:32.780> that<00:01:32.930> up<00:01:33.460> but<00:01:34.460> it<00:01:34.850> has<00:01:35.060> meant<00:01:35.330> that<00:01:35.420> I

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
build that up but it has meant that I

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.840 
build that up but it has meant that I
haven't<00:01:35.930> had<00:01:36.050> to<00:01:36.170> sit<00:01:36.380> there<00:01:36.620> and<00:01:37.070> tediously

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
haven't had to sit there and tediously

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.640 
haven't had to sit there and tediously
go<00:01:38.090> through<00:01:38.450> the<00:01:39.350> elements<00:01:39.980> of<00:01:40.130> sowing<00:01:41.030> seeds

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
go through the elements of sowing seeds

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.940 
go through the elements of sowing seeds
ploughing<00:01:42.650> lands<00:01:43.250> and<00:01:43.780> harvesting<00:01:44.780> crops<00:01:45.050> for

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
ploughing lands and harvesting crops for

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.700 
ploughing lands and harvesting crops for
very<00:01:46.160> little<00:01:46.340> coin<00:01:47.200> so<00:01:48.200> as<00:01:48.260> we<00:01:48.380> enter<00:01:48.590> the

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
very little coin so as we enter the

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.630 
very little coin so as we enter the
store<00:01:48.980> here<00:01:49.570> and<00:01:51.010> this<00:01:52.010> is<00:01:52.100> what<00:01:52.280> you<00:01:52.370> could<00:01:52.490> do

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
store here and this is what you could do

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.710 
store here and this is what you could do
from<00:01:52.790> the<00:01:52.940> start<00:01:53.240> of<00:01:53.330> the<00:01:53.480> game<00:01:55.180> if<00:01:56.180> you<00:01:56.420> head

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
from the start of the game if you head

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.260 
from the start of the game if you head
over<00:01:57.350> to<00:01:58.000> the<00:01:59.000> section<00:01:59.450> where<00:01:59.480> you<00:01:59.960> can<00:01:59.990> add

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
over to the section where you can add

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.190 
over to the section where you can add
items<00:02:02.270> to<00:02:02.780> the<00:02:04.630> terrain<00:02:05.630> place<00:02:05.960> little

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
items to the terrain place little

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.889 
items to the terrain place little
objects<00:02:06.710> as<00:02:06.979> you<00:02:07.760> can<00:02:07.880> see<00:02:08.030> they<00:02:08.240> range<00:02:08.630> in

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
objects as you can see they range in

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.300 
objects as you can see they range in
price<00:02:10.510> and<00:02:11.510> then<00:02:12.230> you<00:02:12.350> just<00:02:12.530> basically<00:02:12.680> place

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
price and then you just basically place

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:19.360 
price and then you just basically place
them<00:02:14.890> wherever<00:02:15.890> you<00:02:16.100> feel<00:02:16.510> the<00:02:17.510> need<00:02:18.130> and<00:02:19.130> then

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
them wherever you feel the need and then

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.410 
them wherever you feel the need and then
they<00:02:19.550> will<00:02:19.880> start<00:02:20.209> earning<00:02:20.450> you<00:02:20.810> money<00:02:22.420> and

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
they will start earning you money and

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.600 
they will start earning you money and
obviously<00:02:23.540> the<00:02:23.900> wind<00:02:24.080> generators<00:02:24.650> cost<00:02:24.920> 1.2

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
obviously the wind generators cost 1.2

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.780 
obviously the wind generators cost 1.2
million<00:02:25.910> to<00:02:26.810> buy<00:02:27.020> which<00:02:27.950> is<00:02:28.100> quite<00:02:28.340> a<00:02:28.370> lot<00:02:28.580> so

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
million to buy which is quite a lot so

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.490 
million to buy which is quite a lot so
you've<00:02:28.940> got<00:02:29.090> to<00:02:29.180> kind<00:02:29.330> of<00:02:29.390> build<00:02:29.690> up<00:02:29.900> over<00:02:30.230> time

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
you've got to kind of build up over time

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:36.550 
you've got to kind of build up over time
