know<00:00:52.420> plugging<00:00:52.750> the<00:00:53.050> microphone<00:00:53.710> into<00:00:54.010> the

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
know plugging the microphone into the

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.840 
know plugging the microphone into the
POV<00:00:54.490> which<00:00:55.360> was<00:00:55.510> horrible<00:00:55.870> even<00:00:56.140> trying<00:00:56.410> to<00:00:56.590> do

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
POV which was horrible even trying to do

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.560 
POV which was horrible even trying to do
lower<00:00:57.850> audio<00:00:58.300> settings<00:00:58.810> it<00:00:59.230> just<00:01:00.450> didn't<00:01:01.450> do

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570
