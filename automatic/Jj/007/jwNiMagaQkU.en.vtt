00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.530

 good thing it's a graphics card that 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.240
 It will give us very good performance 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.880

 each one makes nine enough for the 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.770

 very good resignation is very cool and 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.130

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.220
 two liquid extraction fans 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.390
 in the future another ventilation the 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.070
 mat so that the dust does not pass to the 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.230
 power supply here let's put 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:43.200

 which has cooling for the 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:54.930
 processor you are going to use a current n 9 of s 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.280
 two vouchers for socket 1155 is worth 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.600
 this our processor is not going to 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.300
 train keep in mind that 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:03.300
 you did the least and the truth is that 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:06.300

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:23.050
 ends the budget towards the institute 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:28.060
 and now the budget 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:29.260
 As you can see it goes out to 707 85 45 if 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.730
 you want us to mount the duties of 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.350
 this component me from my point of 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.800
 I recommend that you try to ride it

 Searching is very simple by following the steps 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:47.260
 one by one you can mount the engine a 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.420
 computer seems difficult but when 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.910
 we do it is very easy simply that 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.160
 be careful patience and you will achieve 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.110
