conservation<00:01:58.409> group<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:59.689> one<00:02:00.689> of<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.869> people

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
conservation group and one of the people

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.200 
conservation group and one of the people
I<00:02:01.439> was<00:02:01.619> working<00:02:02.040> with<00:02:02.189> also<00:02:02.640> had<00:02:02.880> worked<00:02:03.090> with

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
I was working with also had worked with

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.520 
I was working with also had worked with
the<00:02:03.329> Nature<00:02:03.630> Conservancy<00:02:04.259> and<00:02:04.409> they

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
the Nature Conservancy and they

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.160 
the Nature Conservancy and they
expressed<00:02:04.979> an<00:02:05.130> interest<00:02:05.399> in<00:02:05.840> if<00:02:06.840> they<00:02:07.020> only

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
expressed an interest in if they only

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.690 
expressed an interest in if they only
had<00:02:07.350> a<00:02:07.380> place<00:02:07.649> where<00:02:08.009> they<00:02:08.129> could<00:02:08.340> do<00:02:08.520> these

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
had a place where they could do these

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.210 
had a place where they could do these
practices<00:02:09.420> and<00:02:09.899> so<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.140> timing<00:02:10.500> worked<00:02:10.679> out

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
practices and so the timing worked out

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.289 
practices and so the timing worked out
almost

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:12.299 
almost

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:14.479 
almost
at<00:02:12.420> this<00:02:12.629> site<00:02:12.840> we<00:02:13.019> do<00:02:13.200> research<00:02:13.769> on<00:02:14.099> wetlands

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
at this site we do research on wetlands

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.500 
at this site we do research on wetlands
how<00:02:14.909> effective<00:02:15.390> they<00:02:15.540> are<00:02:16.129> looking<00:02:17.129> at<00:02:17.510> kind

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
how effective they are looking at kind

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:19.819 
how effective they are looking at kind
of<00:02:18.629> how<00:02:18.780> large<00:02:18.989> the<00:02:19.140> wetlands<00:02:19.439> need<00:02:19.560> to<00:02:19.680> be

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:19.829 
of how large the wetlands need to be

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:22.220 
of how large the wetlands need to be
relative<00:02:20.340> to<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.579> drainage<00:02:20.819> area<00:02:21.090> to<00:02:21.659> retain

past and one of the questions we had on

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.630 
past and one of the questions we had on
those<00:02:33.659> surveys<00:02:34.049> we're<00:02:34.799> to<00:02:34.980> landowners<00:02:35.370> and

those surveys we're to landowners and

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.580 
those surveys we're to landowners and
farmers<00:02:35.700> and<00:02:36.090> we<00:02:36.209> asked<00:02:36.510> them<00:02:36.629> how<00:02:37.260> do<00:02:37.319> you

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
farmers and we asked them how do you

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.160 
farmers and we asked them how do you
prefer<00:02:38.549> to<00:02:38.730> learn<00:02:38.939> about<00:02:39.180> a<00:02:39.329> new<00:02:39.629> conservation

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170

prefer to learn about a new conservation

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:42.719 
practice 9 out of 10 said we want to see

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:44.330 
practice 9 out of 10 said we want to see
it<00:02:42.870> on<00:02:43.019> the<00:02:43.170> ground<00:02:43.409> we<00:02:43.650> want<00:02:43.799> to<00:02:43.859> see<00:02:44.040> how<00:02:44.189> it

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
it on the ground we want to see how it

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.809 
it on the ground we want to see how it
works

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
works

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:46.910 
works
we<00:02:45.000> had<00:02:45.120> a<00:02:45.150> landowner<00:02:45.629> who<00:02:46.019> was<00:02:46.680> pretty

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
we had a landowner who was pretty

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.890 
we had a landowner who was pretty
nervous<00:02:47.099> about<00:02:47.310> putting<00:02:48.090> in<00:02:48.209> a<00:02:48.299> wetland<00:02:48.599> and

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
nervous about putting in a wetland and

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.539 
nervous about putting in a wetland and
we<00:02:49.319> showed<00:02:49.560> him<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:49.799> wetlands<00:02:50.129> here<00:02:50.280> you<00:02:50.400> said

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
we showed him the wetlands here you said

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:52.339 
we showed him the wetlands here you said
oh<00:02:50.669> yeah<00:02:50.849> I<00:02:50.879> can<00:02:51.150> do<00:02:51.299> that<00:02:51.329> farmers<00:02:52.260> are

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
oh yeah I can do that farmers are

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:53.809 
oh yeah I can do that farmers are
naturally<00:02:52.799> good<00:02:53.010> stewards<00:02:53.340> of<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:53.489> land<00:02:53.700> I

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
naturally good stewards of the land I

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:54.979 
naturally good stewards of the land I
mean<00:02:53.970> I<00:02:54.000> think<00:02:54.269> they<00:02:54.389> work<00:02:54.569> the<00:02:54.720> land<00:02:54.870> they

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
mean I think they work the land they

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.159 
mean I think they work the land they
love<00:02:55.200> the<00:02:55.319> land<00:02:55.530> and<00:02:56.280> the<00:02:56.609> more<00:02:56.819> they

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:57.169 
love the land and the more they

00:02:57.169 --> 00:02:59.179 
love the land and the more they
understand<00:02:58.169> you<00:02:58.379> know<00:02:58.470> what<00:02:58.709> is<00:02:58.889> the<00:02:59.040> right

00:02:59.179 --> 00:02:59.189 
understand you know what is the right

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:00.920 
understand you know what is the right
practice<00:02:59.700> and<00:02:59.879> where<00:02:59.970> should<00:03:00.209> it<00:03:00.329> be<00:03:00.480> the<00:03:00.720> more

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
practice and where should it be the more

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.569 
practice and where should it be the more
they're<00:03:01.139> willing<00:03:01.470> to<00:03:01.500> put<00:03:01.739> these<00:03:01.889> in<00:03:02.129> if<00:03:02.430> you

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
they're willing to put these in if you

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:04.940 
they're willing to put these in if you
can<00:03:02.730> take<00:03:02.939> 3%<00:03:03.540> out<00:03:03.689> of<00:03:03.810> the<00:03:03.870> ground<00:03:04.139> and<00:03:04.470> to

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
can take 3% out of the ground and to

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.619 
can take 3% out of the ground and to
convert<00:03:05.280> it<00:03:05.370> to<00:03:05.400> wetland<00:03:05.849> you<00:03:06.030> would<00:03:06.150> remove<00:03:06.450> a

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:06.629 
convert it to wetland you would remove a

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:09.259 
convert it to wetland you would remove a
lot<00:03:06.840> of<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:07.370> nitrates<00:03:08.370> and<00:03:08.519> the<00:03:08.609> things<00:03:08.879> that

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
lot of the nitrates and the things that

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.149 
lot of the nitrates and the things that
are<00:03:09.450> not<00:03:09.629> good<00:03:09.870> for<00:03:10.049> the<00:03:10.169> water<00:03:10.349> quality<00:03:10.590> and

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 
are not good for the water quality and

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:13.759 
are not good for the water quality and
so<00:03:11.760> somebody<00:03:12.000> I<00:03:12.480> think<00:03:12.810> has<00:03:13.260> to<00:03:13.379> look<00:03:13.530> at<00:03:13.680> it

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
so somebody I think has to look at it

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:15.890 
so somebody I think has to look at it
and<00:03:13.859> say<00:03:14.010> it's<00:03:14.189> a<00:03:14.250> 3%<00:03:14.819> reduction<00:03:14.970> worthwhile

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
and say it's a 3% reduction worthwhile

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.879 
and say it's a 3% reduction worthwhile
and<00:03:16.260> it<00:03:17.120> is<00:03:18.120> and<00:03:18.359> I<00:03:18.389> think<00:03:18.419> that's<00:03:19.139> a<00:03:19.440> small

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:19.889 
and it is and I think that's a small

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:22.490 
and it is and I think that's a small
price<00:03:20.129> to<00:03:20.159> pay<00:03:20.370> to<00:03:20.579> keep<00:03:21.060> the<00:03:21.269> water<00:03:21.599> the<00:03:22.290> water

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
price to pay to keep the water the water

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.960 
price to pay to keep the water the water
safe<00:03:22.769> not<00:03:23.010> only<00:03:23.040> around<00:03:23.340> here<00:03:23.609> but<00:03:23.819> again

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
safe not only around here but again

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.720 
safe not only around here but again
everybody<00:03:24.540> downstream<00:03:25.049> as<00:03:25.199> well

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.819 

you
