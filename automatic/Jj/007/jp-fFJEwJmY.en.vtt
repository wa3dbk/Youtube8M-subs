00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
have them match it and that's how we got

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:04.380

this<00:02:58.670> color<00:02:58.940> this<00:02:59.900> pink<00:03:00.200> on<00:03:00.319> the<00:03:00.440> wall

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.940 

ironically<00:03:05.390> we<00:03:05.600> did<00:03:05.780> not<00:03:05.959> have<00:03:06.260> the<00:03:06.680> bedding

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
ironically we did not have the bedding

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.610 
ironically we did not have the bedding
set<00:03:07.220> picked<00:03:08.090> out<00:03:08.269> before<00:03:09.019> we<00:03:09.140> started<00:03:09.470> this

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
set picked out before we started this

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.650 
set picked out before we started this
theme<00:03:09.830> and<00:03:10.250> that<00:03:10.310> was<00:03:11.180> really<00:03:11.450> difficult

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
theme and that was really difficult

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.530 
theme and that was really difficult
because<00:03:12.170> if<00:03:12.709> we<00:03:13.489> did<00:03:13.640> this<00:03:13.760> whole<00:03:14.030> color

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
because if we did this whole color

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.830 
because if we did this whole color
scheme<00:03:14.810> in<00:03:15.350> this<00:03:15.500> room<00:03:15.799> and<00:03:16.220> had<00:03:17.090> the<00:03:17.299> toughest

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
scheme in this room and had the toughest

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.080 
scheme in this room and had the toughest
time<00:03:18.110> finding<00:03:18.739> a<00:03:18.829> bedding<00:03:19.220> set<00:03:19.489> that<00:03:20.000> actually

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
time finding a bedding set that actually

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.860 
time finding a bedding set that actually
would<00:03:20.390> match<00:03:20.570> it<00:03:20.810> because<00:03:21.170> this<00:03:21.410> this<00:03:21.859> kind<00:03:22.640> of

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
would match it because this this kind of

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.470 
would match it because this this kind of
dusty<00:03:23.870> pink<00:03:24.140> is<00:03:24.380> not<00:03:24.799> a<00:03:24.829> common<00:03:25.250> baby<00:03:25.400> color<00:03:25.700> so

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480
