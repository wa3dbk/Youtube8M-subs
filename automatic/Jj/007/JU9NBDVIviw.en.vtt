00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.170
 saved uncle space users are 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:11.240
 Doctor wise we are here today with the brief 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.250
 video dedicated to 15 in particular 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:17.060
 on the subject of means of power plants 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:19.250
 because we have seen in the various games 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:22.460
 that the central defenders even those a 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.890
 a little slower alex terry branches etc. 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.810
 etc. are therefore used therefore 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.880
 I'll show you a couple of clips 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.970
 first of all these defenders are 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.160
 lenses are slow, however, where they pay 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.260
 they pay this speed in the field 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.269
 therefore open in situations where 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.100
 maybe they have to defend against one 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:43.010
 striker who gets his back to the goal 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.379
 they know their stuff then often i 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.180
 elected defenders are also very good 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:50.180
 in the header then this can 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.440
 definitely help them on the cross 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.690
 I'll show you a couple of examples 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.909
 then how to use them surely if 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.100
 you are at a disadvantage as in 

00:00:55.909 --> 00:00:59.570
 In this case you never have to go up 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.659
 what the ball has to get you to 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:05.150
 half between the player with the ball and the 

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:06.740
 player without ball 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.960
 in this way you have seen the filter 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.579
 was intercepted in the header 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.399
 another thing I often do with maybe 

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:15.500
 or the back cover is strong 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:17.509
 so maybe shore dynastic then thanks 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.100
 I can get the ball back on the other side 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:20.659
 example as in this case try to 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.729
 send them outside in this case 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.770
 we had a match against alzo that 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.729
 certainly faster than the defender 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:30.499
 German however a match thanks to the physical is 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:31.969
 then managed to stop him by sending 

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:34.399
 on the outside in this case I did 

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:36.530
 see what diego costs has not stopped 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:38.749
 well if it is made to recover from a bes 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.969
 so we saw the stops are not 

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:42.920
 precise and also the cross to see what it is 

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:44.359
 a completely free cross that is wrong 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.579
 successful 

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:47.929
 another thing these defenders are a lot 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:51.280
 strong head so you have seen often 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:54.109
 that go to anticipate the attacker 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.189
 so I have to say that it was a fact 

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:56.899
 great work also in this case 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:58.789
 even a certain paradoxical situation 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:00.950
 but a Persian spent a lot of time 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:03.829
 goes to recover it goes to divert this 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.270
 balloon goes to reduce its power 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:06.210
 of course we must be very careful 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.680
 I see 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.270
 many people will prefer the two 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.649
 fast players because maybe there are 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.810
 also the power stations quite fast as 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.220
 chiellini but they also have a great deal 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.360
 amount of fig however there is to say that 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.010
 even these players a little bit 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.380
 fillets but maybe better than the shot 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.120
 they know for sure the fact of their head 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.739
 you have to be careful of situations like 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.989
 this that if you leave in the field 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:27.270
 open sturridge versus castanea story 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.920
 the one to import safely though 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.420
 therefore confirm nothing these years 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.230
 defenders we will see you soon 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.230
 Hi everyone
