00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
prepared for this a lot of people ask me

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.300 
prepared for this a lot of people ask me
like<00:00:39.720> what<00:00:40.020> do<00:00:40.079> you<00:00:40.110> do<00:00:40.260> against<00:00:40.560> baldo<00:00:41.040> but

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:41.310

like what do you do against baldo but
it's<00:00:41.430> not<00:00:41.610> something<00:00:41.850> you<00:00:42.000> can<00:00:42.060> sum<00:00:42.420> up<00:00:42.450> into<00:00:42.870> a

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
it's not something you can sum up into a

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.139

sentence<00:00:43.380> or<00:00:43.500> two<00:00:43.560> I<00:00:43.980> think<00:00:44.489> you<00:00:44.700> just<00:00:44.730> have<00:00:45.000> to

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
sentence or two I think you just have to

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.250 
sentence or two I think you just have to
play<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.329> match<00:00:45.600> up<00:00:45.840> it's<00:00:45.989> very<00:00:46.050> difficult

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
play the match up it's very difficult

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.170 
play the match up it's very difficult
yeah<00:00:46.829> yes<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.130> have<00:00:47.220> experienced<00:00:47.670> about<00:00:47.880> them

yeah yes I have experienced about them
about<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.720> move<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.050> everything<00:00:49.110> I'd<00:00:49.710> say

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
about the move and everything I'd say

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.410 
about the move and everything I'd say
generally<00:00:50.460> speaking<00:00:50.790> a<00:00:50.910> good<00:00:50.940> rule<00:00:51.300> of<00:00:51.329> thumb

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
generally speaking a good rule of thumb

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.290 
generally speaking a good rule of thumb
is<00:00:51.750> avoid<00:00:52.079> avoid<00:00:52.800> highs<00:00:53.130> or<00:00:53.160> midst<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:54.030> hit

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
is avoid avoid highs or midst that hit
