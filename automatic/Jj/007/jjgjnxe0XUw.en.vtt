becoming night I think we might as well
see<00:00:26.340> what<00:00:26.730> it<00:00:26.849> does<00:00:27.199> before<00:00:28.199> I<00:00:28.470> have<00:00:28.650> to

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
see what it does before I have to

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:49.279 
see what it does before I have to
explain<00:00:29.039> how<00:00:29.580> does<00:00:29.910> it<00:00:47.539> okay<00:00:48.539> now<00:00:48.930> that<00:00:48.960> you've

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
sure if I'm the first one to build this

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.139 
sure if I'm the first one to build this
or<00:01:01.109> not<00:01:01.289> but<00:01:01.530> from<00:01:02.160> what<00:01:02.280> i<00:01:02.340> have<00:01:02.520> seen<00:01:02.579> most

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
very big line of cobweb but I don't have

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.240 
very big line of cobweb but I don't have
that<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.880> have<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.750> system<00:01:13.170> if<00:01:13.650> somebody<00:01:14.040> has

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
that I have the system if somebody has

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.760 
that I have the system if somebody has
build<00:01:14.610> this<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:14.970> I<00:01:15.030> later<00:01:15.330> find<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:15.869> i'll<00:01:16.320> put

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
build this and I later find it i'll put

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.289 
build this and I later find it i'll put
the<00:01:16.890> list<00:01:17.070> officer<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.640> put<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:17.820> link<00:01:18.060> in<00:01:18.210> the

I also another thing I need to take care

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:26.490 
I also another thing I need to take care
of<00:01:24.190> is<00:01:24.549> that<00:01:24.970> there<00:01:25.180> is<00:01:25.420> one<00:01:25.450> flaw<00:01:26.080> in<00:01:26.320> this

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
of is that there is one flaw in this

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.130 
of is that there is one flaw in this
design<00:01:26.920> of<00:01:27.190> where<00:01:27.430> this<00:01:28.060> solar<00:01:28.390> panel<00:01:28.930> if

design of where this solar panel if

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.480 
design of where this solar panel if
somebody<00:01:29.979> sleeps<00:01:30.369> before<00:01:30.970> it's<00:01:31.180> around<00:01:32.490> more

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
somebody sleeps before it's around more

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.760 
somebody sleeps before it's around more
minute<00:01:33.820> after<00:01:34.330> the<00:01:34.750> night<00:01:34.930> starts<00:01:35.380> or<00:01:35.500> 30

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
solar the solar panel timer system won't

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.580 
solar the solar panel timer system won't
work<00:01:41.770> and<00:01:42.240> that<00:01:43.240> will<00:01:43.360> cause<00:01:43.540> the<00:01:43.690> chicken<00:01:44.110> the

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
work and that will cause the chicken the

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.219 
work and that will cause the chicken the
circuits<00:01:45.430> he<00:01:45.550> never<00:01:45.729> to<00:01:45.909> activate<00:01:46.390> which<00:01:47.080> will

circuits he never to activate which will

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:50.100 
circuits he never to activate which will
cause<00:01:47.440> the<00:01:47.590> chickens<00:01:48.040> do<00:01:48.880> not<00:01:49.060> fall<00:01:49.479> down<00:01:49.750> and

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
cause the chickens do not fall down and

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.719 
cause the chickens do not fall down and
that<00:01:50.440> will<00:01:50.560> cause<00:01:50.740> the<00:01:50.890> chicken<00:01:51.220> overload

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
that will cause the chicken overload

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:56.550 
that will cause the chicken overload
which<00:01:52.090> could<00:01:53.700> could<00:01:54.700> signify<00:01:55.149> a<00:01:55.570> very<00:01:56.050> big<00:01:56.259> leg

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
which could could signify a very big leg

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.010 
which could could signify a very big leg
problem<00:01:57.100> to<00:01:57.880> people<00:01:58.179> who<00:01:58.330> don't<00:01:58.539> have<00:01:58.780> good

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
problem to people who don't have good

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.840 
problem to people who don't have good
computers<00:01:59.500> or<00:01:59.679> who<00:01:59.830> cannot<00:02:00.039> come<00:02:00.310> here<00:02:00.700> and

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
computers or who cannot come here and

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.480 
computers or who cannot come here and
reset<00:02:01.330> the<00:02:01.450> system<00:02:02.190> okay<00:02:03.190> now<00:02:03.310> that<00:02:03.460> that's

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
reset the system okay now that that's

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.749 
reset the system okay now that that's
taken<00:02:03.789> care<00:02:04.119> of<00:02:04.330> let's<00:02:04.509> just<00:02:05.170> go<00:02:06.009> into<00:02:06.520> how

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
taken care of let's just go into how

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:09.630 
taken care of let's just go into how
this<00:02:06.970> works<00:02:07.270> so<00:02:08.200> up<00:02:08.350> here<00:02:08.380> is<00:02:08.800> a<00:02:08.830> very<00:02:09.429> simple

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
this works so up here is a very simple

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.479 
this works so up here is a very simple
chicken<00:02:10.000> farm<00:02:10.390> and<00:02:10.690> this<00:02:11.620> chicken<00:02:11.920> prime<00:02:12.310> is

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
chicken farm and this chicken prime is

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:14.790 
chicken farm and this chicken prime is
actually<00:02:12.820> for<00:02:13.060> laying<00:02:13.420> eggs<00:02:13.750> so<00:02:14.380> once<00:02:14.620> the

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
actually for laying eggs so once the

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.580 
actually for laying eggs so once the
eggs<00:02:15.040> go<00:02:15.310> down<00:02:15.519> they<00:02:15.730> go<00:02:15.880> down<00:02:16.090> here<00:02:16.420> so<00:02:17.380> some

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
eggs go down they go down here so some

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.259 
eggs go down they go down here so some
of<00:02:17.620> you<00:02:17.860> guys<00:02:17.980> might<00:02:18.220> think<00:02:18.519> why<00:02:18.730> did<00:02:18.940> I<00:02:19.060> put

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:19.269 
of you guys might think why did I put

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:21.630 
of you guys might think why did I put
the<00:02:19.390> chickens<00:02:19.930> in<00:02:20.080> there<00:02:20.410> the<00:02:21.340> other<00:02:21.459> reason

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
the chickens in there the other reason

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.940 
the chickens in there the other reason
is<00:02:21.910> because<00:02:22.150> after<00:02:22.569> some<00:02:22.810> testing<00:02:23.319> I<00:02:23.500> figured

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
is because after some testing I figured

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.819 
is because after some testing I figured
that<00:02:24.220> a<00:02:24.459> lot<00:02:25.120> of<00:02:25.239> eggs<00:02:25.480> are<00:02:25.750> lost<00:02:25.989> because<00:02:26.260> when

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:26.829 
that a lot of eggs are lost because when

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:28.650 
that a lot of eggs are lost because when
the<00:02:26.950> chickens<00:02:27.310> lays<00:02:27.519> an<00:02:27.670> egg<00:02:27.700> they<00:02:28.090> can<00:02:28.299> lay<00:02:28.510> it

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
the chickens lays an egg they can lay it

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.020 
the chickens lays an egg they can lay it
in<00:02:28.840> one<00:02:29.079> of<00:02:29.110> these<00:02:29.320> blocks<00:02:29.769> which<00:02:30.670> will<00:02:30.820> cause

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
in one of these blocks which will cause

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.680 
in one of these blocks which will cause
it<00:02:31.269> to<00:02:31.299> fly<00:02:31.690> away<00:02:32.019> into<00:02:32.799> nowhere<00:02:33.610> more<00:02:34.299> onto

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
it to fly away into nowhere more onto

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.229 
it to fly away into nowhere more onto
the<00:02:34.810> floor<00:02:35.340> so<00:02:36.340> that's<00:02:36.549> a<00:02:36.670> very<00:02:36.700> big<00:02:37.030> problem

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
the floor so that's a very big problem

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.449 
the floor so that's a very big problem
and<00:02:37.780> that<00:02:38.019> will<00:02:38.140> lower<00:02:38.350> your<00:02:38.530> efficiency<00:02:39.220> by<00:02:39.430> a

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
and that will lower your efficiency by a

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.569 
and that will lower your efficiency by a
lot<00:02:39.750> so<00:02:40.750> what<00:02:40.930> happens<00:02:41.290> is<00:02:41.410> that<00:02:41.440> the<00:02:41.739> X<00:02:42.280> go

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:42.579 
lot so what happens is that the X go

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:46.229 
lot so what happens is that the X go
down<00:02:42.790> here<00:02:43.120> and<00:02:43.230> go<00:02:44.230> through<00:02:44.590> this<00:02:44.769> little<00:02:45.549> bag

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
down here and go through this little bag

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:47.970 
down here and go through this little bag
golden<00:02:46.720> pressure<00:02:46.930> plate

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
golden pressure plate

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.830 
golden pressure plate
and<00:02:48.099> if<00:02:48.489> you<00:02:48.610> guys<00:02:48.790> didn't<00:02:49.120> know<00:02:49.150> I<00:02:49.420> here<00:02:49.810> I

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
and if you guys didn't know I here I

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.380 
and if you guys didn't know I here I
have<00:02:50.050> something<00:02:50.650> setup<00:02:50.860> is<00:02:51.370> that<00:02:51.909> if<00:02:52.060> there<00:02:52.299> is

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
have something setup is that if there is

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.789 
have something setup is that if there is
a<00:02:52.420> redstone<00:02:52.870> update<00:02:54.450> if<00:02:55.450> and<00:02:55.810> the<00:02:56.349> dispenser

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
a redstone update if and the dispenser

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:59.039 
a redstone update if and the dispenser
is<00:02:56.890> powered<00:02:57.280> it<00:02:57.790> will<00:02:57.940> cause<00:02:58.209> the<00:02:58.569> dispenser

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
is powered it will cause the dispenser

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:01.559 
is powered it will cause the dispenser
to<00:02:59.080> shoot<00:02:59.409> our<00:02:59.560> own<00:02:59.769> item<00:03:00.129> so<00:03:00.879> I'm<00:03:01.060> exploiting

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
to shoot our own item so I'm exploiting

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:05.309 
to shoot our own item so I'm exploiting
that<00:03:01.780> glitch<00:03:02.200> here<00:03:03.069> where<00:03:03.730> the<00:03:03.970> this<00:03:04.780> little

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
that glitch here where the this little

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.070 
that glitch here where the this little
red<00:03:05.590> this<00:03:05.980> pressure<00:03:06.459> plate<00:03:06.760> it's<00:03:07.420> causing<00:03:07.900> a

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
red this pressure plate it's causing a

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.809 
red this pressure plate it's causing a
redstone<00:03:08.590> update<00:03:08.830> which<00:03:09.160> is<00:03:09.280> causing<00:03:09.549> the

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
redstone update which is causing the

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:12.030 
redstone update which is causing the
Spencer<00:03:10.209> to<00:03:10.330> shoot<00:03:10.569> out<00:03:10.720> the<00:03:10.900> eggs<00:03:11.110> and<00:03:11.410> then

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
Spencer to shoot out the eggs and then

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.960 
Spencer to shoot out the eggs and then
being<00:03:12.250> refilled<00:03:12.700> by<00:03:12.879> the<00:03:12.940> hop<00:03:14.700> another<00:03:15.700> thing

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
being refilled by the hop another thing

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.069 
being refilled by the hop another thing
then<00:03:16.750> after<00:03:17.079> that<00:03:17.260> the<00:03:18.069> chickens<00:03:18.790> hatch<00:03:19.629> and

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079 
then after that the chickens hatch and

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:23.250 
then after that the chickens hatch and
they<00:03:20.290> go<00:03:20.440> there<00:03:20.950> and<00:03:21.220> then<00:03:22.090> after<00:03:22.450> that<00:03:22.629> we<00:03:23.049> go

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
they go there and then after that we go

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.339 
they go there and then after that we go
back<00:03:23.560> to<00:03:23.590> the<00:03:23.860> Redstone<00:03:24.690> so<00:03:25.690> right<00:03:25.870> here<00:03:26.200> I

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:26.349 
back to the Redstone so right here I

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:28.650 
back to the Redstone so right here I
have<00:03:26.620> a<00:03:26.829> solar<00:03:27.069> panel<00:03:27.340> this<00:03:27.879> solar<00:03:28.180> panel<00:03:28.569> in

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
have a solar panel this solar panel in

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.589 
have a solar panel this solar panel in
the<00:03:28.780> morning<00:03:29.140> is<00:03:29.319> powering<00:03:29.799> these<00:03:30.040> two<00:03:30.250> guys

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:30.599 
the morning is powering these two guys

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:33.449 
the morning is powering these two guys
however<00:03:31.599> in<00:03:31.750> the<00:03:31.870> night<00:03:32.079> if<00:03:32.379> I<00:03:32.590> set<00:03:33.010> the<00:03:33.220> time

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
however in the night if I set the time

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:39.839 
however in the night if I set the time
to<00:03:34.500> 20,000<00:03:37.410> it<00:03:38.410> will<00:03:38.650> turn<00:03:38.890> this<00:03:39.040> off<00:03:39.280> and<00:03:39.609> it

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:39.849 
to 20,000 it will turn this off and it

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:42.599 
to 20,000 it will turn this off and it
will<00:03:39.940> turn<00:03:40.120> the<00:03:40.299> whole<00:03:40.510> system<00:03:40.840> on<00:03:41.609> because

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:42.609 
will turn the whole system on because

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:46.199 
will turn the whole system on because
this<00:03:43.209> no<00:03:43.480> longer<00:03:43.840> has<00:03:43.989> a<00:03:44.019> frequency<00:03:44.940> so<00:03:45.940> let's

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
this no longer has a frequency so let's

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.710 
this no longer has a frequency so let's
first<00:03:46.450> go<00:03:46.629> through<00:03:46.660> here<00:03:47.970> this<00:03:48.970> goes<00:03:49.450> through

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
first go through here this goes through

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.800 
first go through here this goes through
here<00:03:50.019> and<00:03:50.140> up<00:03:50.590> and<00:03:51.400> I'll<00:03:51.819> power<00:03:52.030> that<00:03:52.419> redstone

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
here and up and I'll power that redstone

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.199 
here and up and I'll power that redstone
torch<00:03:53.200> there<00:03:53.950> is<00:03:54.190> some<00:03:54.400> Tory<00:03:54.639> to<00:03:54.790> goes<00:03:54.970> through

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
torch there is some Tory to goes through

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:57.509 
torch there is some Tory to goes through
here<00:03:55.510> to<00:03:55.720> a<00:03:55.750> simple<00:03:56.440> monostable<00:03:56.980> circuit

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
here to a simple monostable circuit

00:03:57.519 --> 00:03:59.610 
here to a simple monostable circuit
which<00:03:58.239> is<00:03:58.419> just<00:03:58.569> the<00:03:58.660> piston<00:03:59.049> with<00:03:59.230> a<00:03:59.260> block

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
which is just the piston with a block

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.080 
which is just the piston with a block
that<00:04:00.030> power<00:04:01.030> is<00:04:01.180> this<00:04:01.450> guy<00:04:01.690> this<00:04:02.079> block<00:04:02.500> and

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
for a fraction of a second which causes

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.879 
for a fraction of a second which causes
this<00:04:06.280> to<00:04:06.310> continue<00:04:06.730> and<00:04:07.269> this<00:04:07.480> do<00:04:08.230> have<00:04:08.470> to<00:04:08.739> be

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:08.889 
this to continue and this do have to be

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:11.120 
this to continue and this do have to be
no<00:04:09.040> delay<00:04:09.489> before<00:04:10.060> reaching<00:04:10.450> this<00:04:10.720> and

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.240 
makes this dispenser shoot out the lava
and<00:04:22.210> suck<00:04:22.720> it<00:04:22.750> back<00:04:23.020> in<00:04:23.320> in<00:04:23.590> a<00:04:23.710> fraction<00:04:23.950> of<00:04:24.190> a

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
and suck it back in in a fraction of a

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.379 
and suck it back in in a fraction of a
second<00:04:24.580> this<00:04:25.419> also<00:04:25.630> goes<00:04:25.900> through<00:04:26.289> here

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
second this also goes through here

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:29.719 
second this also goes through here
and<00:04:27.479> Kazem<00:04:28.169> is<00:04:28.289> a<00:04:28.319> causes<00:04:28.949> an<00:04:29.069> update<00:04:29.430> like

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:29.729 
and Kazem is a causes an update like

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:32.330 
and Kazem is a causes an update like
shown<00:04:29.999> there<00:04:30.270> which<00:04:31.229> causes<00:04:31.650> the<00:04:31.830> dispenser

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
shown there which causes the dispenser

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.469 
shown there which causes the dispenser
to<00:04:32.490> be<00:04:32.610> sucked<00:04:32.969> the<00:04:33.780> lava<00:04:34.050> to<00:04:34.229> be<00:04:34.319> sucked<00:04:34.560> back

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:35.479 
to be sucked the lava to be sucked back

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:39.189 
to be sucked the lava to be sucked back
so<00:04:36.479> that's<00:04:36.779> pretty<00:04:37.199> much<00:04:37.289> how<00:04:37.740> it<00:04:37.770> works<00:04:38.129> and

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:39.199 
so that's pretty much how it works and

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:41.959 
so that's pretty much how it works and
and<00:04:40.199> I<00:04:40.529> like<00:04:40.740> making<00:04:41.009> how<00:04:41.249> works<00:04:41.639> videos

00:04:41.959 --> 00:04:41.969 
and I like making how works videos

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:43.550 
and I like making how works videos
because<00:04:42.150> that's<00:04:42.389> how<00:04:42.599> I<00:04:42.629> pretty<00:04:43.110> much<00:04:43.199> lived

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
because that's how I pretty much lived

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.010 
because that's how I pretty much lived

whetstone what's by seeing people tell
me<00:04:46.050> how<00:04:46.919> the<00:04:46.979> contraption<00:04:47.759> works<00:04:47.969> and<00:04:48.240> why<00:04:48.419> it

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:48.449 
me how the contraption works and why it

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:53.059 
me how the contraption works and why it
works<00:04:48.779> that<00:04:49.590> way<00:04:50.029> so<00:04:51.029> let's<00:04:51.930> just<00:04:52.199> give<00:04:52.800> it<00:04:52.830> a

00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:53.069 
works that way so let's just give it a

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:56.420 
works that way so let's just give it a
let's<00:04:53.969> just<00:04:54.150> see<00:04:54.900> that<00:04:55.110> yeah<00:04:55.889> let's<00:04:56.099> just<00:04:56.159> give

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
let's just see that yeah let's just give

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.019 
let's just see that yeah let's just give
it<00:04:56.460> a<00:04:56.610> test<00:04:56.879> or<00:04:57.180> test<00:04:57.870> go<00:04:58.050> not<00:04:58.499> sweat<00:04:59.029> that's

00:05:00.019 --> 00:05:00.029 
it a test or test go not sweat that's

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:03.920 
it a test or test go not sweat that's
zero<00:05:01.099> so<00:05:02.099> it's<00:05:02.400> morning<00:05:02.699> all<00:05:03.389> the<00:05:03.779> red

sprinkles back here and backhoes now and

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.749 
sprinkles back here and backhoes now and
when<00:05:07.169> it<00:05:07.259> becomes<00:05:07.529> 9<00:05:07.860> which<00:05:08.219> is<00:05:08.250> 20<00:05:08.729> minutes

00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:08.759 
when it becomes 9 which is 20 minutes

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:11.499 
when it becomes 9 which is 20 minutes

that<00:05:18.530> the<00:05:18.650> piston<00:05:19.479> push<00:05:20.479> up<00:05:20.720> pushed<00:05:21.080> out<00:05:21.320> and

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:21.650 
that the piston push up pushed out and

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.100 
that the piston push up pushed out and
sucked<00:05:21.919> back<00:05:22.130> in<00:05:22.370> the<00:05:22.610> lava<00:05:22.820> and<00:05:23.210> then<00:05:23.900> that

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
sucked back in the lava and then that

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.800 
sucked back in the lava and then that
piston<00:05:24.470> was<00:05:24.590> pushed<00:05:24.919> back<00:05:25.190> so<00:05:26.180> let's<00:05:26.360> just<00:05:26.509> put

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.810 
piston was pushed back so let's just put

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.499 
piston was pushed back so let's just put
some<00:05:27.169> mobs<00:05:27.440> in<00:05:27.620> here<00:05:27.919> just<00:05:28.370> a<00:05:28.550> few<00:05:28.639> chickens<00:05:29.180> in

here and just close that close it up and

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.270 
here and just close that close it up and
the<00:05:35.090> flash<00:05:35.300> time<00:05:35.600> sets<00:05:36.169> hey<00:05:36.770> why<00:05:37.039> am<00:05:37.070> I<00:05:37.220> doing

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 
the flash time sets hey why am I doing

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.810 
the flash time sets hey why am I doing
this<00:05:37.550> again<00:05:38.229> morning<00:05:39.229> and<00:05:39.440> then<00:05:40.280> one<00:05:40.490> day<00:05:40.520> has

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:40.820 
this again morning and then one day has

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:46.270 
this again morning and then one day has
passed<00:05:40.910> but<00:05:41.840> yeah<00:05:44.169> one<00:05:45.169> day<00:05:45.289> s<00:05:45.440> box<00:05:45.770> and<00:05:46.039> then

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.280 
passed but yeah one day s box and then

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.629 
passed but yeah one day s box and then
it's<00:05:46.520> morning<00:05:46.880> again<00:05:47.740> so<00:05:48.740> that's<00:05:48.889> 10<00:05:49.280> minutes

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:49.639 
it's morning again so that's 10 minutes

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:51.629 
it's morning again so that's 10 minutes
so<00:05:49.910> by<00:05:50.090> then<00:05:50.270> they<00:05:50.419> would<00:05:50.570> have<00:05:50.600> grown<00:05:50.990> and

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:51.639 
so by then they would have grown and

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:55.240 
so by then they would have grown and
then<00:05:52.639> we<00:05:53.030> do<00:05:53.210> this<00:05:53.419> again<00:05:53.630> and<00:05:54.080> they<00:05:54.620> die<00:05:54.919> to

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.250 
then we do this again and they die to

00:05:55.250 --> 00:06:00.850 
then we do this again and they die to
death<00:05:58.030> did<00:05:59.030> that<00:05:59.210> actually<00:05:59.360> fine<00:05:59.720> oh<00:05:59.870> let's

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:00.860 
death did that actually fine oh let's

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.080 
death did that actually fine oh let's
see<00:06:01.039> I<00:06:01.070> guess<00:06:01.190> that's<00:06:01.550> something<00:06:01.669> I<00:06:01.910> need<00:06:02.030> to

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:02.090 
see I guess that's something I need to

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.659 
see I guess that's something I need to
work<00:06:02.150> on<00:06:02.740> but<00:06:03.740> before<00:06:04.160> I<00:06:04.190> do<00:06:04.280> the<00:06:04.490> tutorial

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:04.669 
work on but before I do the tutorial

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:07.390 
work on but before I do the tutorial
i'll<00:06:05.600> be<00:06:06.139> sure<00:06:06.410> to<00:06:06.440> fix<00:06:06.860> all<00:06:07.039> these<00:06:07.190> little

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:07.400 
i'll be sure to fix all these little

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.779 
i'll be sure to fix all these little
glitches<00:06:07.699> that<00:06:08.090> keep<00:06:09.020> happening<00:06:09.669> but<00:06:10.669> yeah

00:06:10.779 --> 00:06:10.789 
glitches that keep happening but yeah

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:14.200 
glitches that keep happening but yeah
that<00:06:10.970> shoots<00:06:11.210> out<00:06:11.389> and<00:06:11.720> then<00:06:12.020> that's<00:06:12.260> lab<00:06:13.210> that

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:14.210 
that shoots out and then that's lab that

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:17.200 
that shoots out and then that's lab that
slab<00:06:14.510> keeps<00:06:14.840> the<00:06:15.050> chickens<00:06:15.740> half<00:06:16.099> block<00:06:16.490> up<00:06:16.759> so

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:17.210 
slab keeps the chickens half block up so

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.510 
slab keeps the chickens half block up so
only<00:06:18.110> part<00:06:18.500> of<00:06:18.560> that<00:06:18.710> get<00:06:18.860> print<00:06:19.130> and<00:06:19.340> they

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:19.520 
only part of that get print and they

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.430 
only part of that get print and they
don't<00:06:19.639> die<00:06:19.910> and<00:06:20.210> then<00:06:20.570> afterwards<00:06:21.080> after<00:06:21.380> a

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:21.440 
don't die and then afterwards after a

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.520 
don't die and then afterwards after a
few<00:06:21.680> seconds<00:06:22.669> they<00:06:22.849> burn<00:06:23.180> to<00:06:23.330> death<00:06:23.530> the

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:24.530 
few seconds they burn to death the

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:26.500 
few seconds they burn to death the
Harper<00:06:25.070> picks<00:06:25.370> up<00:06:25.520> the<00:06:25.669> items<00:06:26.000> through<00:06:26.360> the

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:26.510 
Harper picks up the items through the

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:29.290 
Harper picks up the items through the
slab<00:06:26.810> and<00:06:27.260> then<00:06:28.130> puts<00:06:28.370> them<00:06:28.580> into<00:06:28.729> this<00:06:28.940> chest

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:29.300 
slab and then puts them into this chest

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.060 
slab and then puts them into this chest
so<00:06:29.539> the<00:06:29.840> raw<00:06:30.020> chicken<00:06:30.410> is<00:06:30.530> from<00:06:30.740> the<00:06:30.889> mass

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:31.070 
so the raw chicken is from the mass

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:33.159 
so the raw chicken is from the mass
massacre<00:06:31.490> I<00:06:31.820> had<00:06:32.090> because<00:06:32.539> I<00:06:32.599> had<00:06:32.720> to<00:06:32.810> kill<00:06:32.990> all

00:06:52.719 --> 00:06:52.729 
overload and then they will start the

00:06:52.729 --> 00:06:54.790 
overload and then they will start the
spawning<00:06:53.090> rather<00:06:53.630> than<00:06:53.900> saving<00:06:54.349> the<00:06:54.470> items
