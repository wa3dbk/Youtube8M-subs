00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.710 

and<00:01:03.550> I<00:01:03.640> think<00:01:03.700> due<00:01:03.910> to<00:01:04.030> both<00:01:04.180> visitors<00:01:04.660> and

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.780 
and I think due to both visitors and
locals<00:01:05.080> could<00:01:05.650> come<00:01:05.890> because<00:01:06.250> these<00:01:06.520> are

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
locals could come because these are

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.050 
locals could come because these are
things<00:01:07.150> from<00:01:07.780> their<00:01:08.680> home<00:01:08.950> we<00:01:09.670> call<00:01:09.910> it<00:01:09.940> the
