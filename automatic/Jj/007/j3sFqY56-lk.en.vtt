00:00:01.739 --> 00:00:04.810
 in general in both the novels and videolar 

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.840
 to the number 4 numerical expressions with contents in the sets numbers 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.849
 integers 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.679
 I do not think every potential annual gain 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:19.449
 we must make the modifications the division only to equivalent operations 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:23.250
 and there we do adhesions subtractions position and we go 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.550
 eliminate the relatives 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.310
 then we'll eliminate the whispers after the birds this summer 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:31.419
 Besides that 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:33.460
 we made changes 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:34.910
 example 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.280
 first three with four times 2 for those who have 15 and 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.320
 multiplication then you have to do 4 x 2 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.410
 4x2 equal or iptu 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.670
 after I multiply it and then I am the reason why multiplication and 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.550
 preference on the adhesion of the small recap are the root potencies 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.550
 have preference over the modifications or divisions 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.860
 in the stretch a year ago with 8 equal rose 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.460
 example 2 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.940
 3 - 4 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.820
 multiplied by two and three 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.830
 - the picture of the panic issue is yes do first jaden of the country 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:20.500
 3-4-1 of 3 7 to 4 if one is left to subtract a bit bitten the frame 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.890
 sign of the good driver 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.290
 At least one - we will stay for 2 different signs one is negative for 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:28.670
 positive 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.670
 negative answer - 2 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.760
 what we should do first are the ex finals 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:52.090
 and this division here is what needs to be done so I marked here the 36 years 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.300
 36 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.780
 at least 4 and of all this the rest of the group 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.690
 repeat more every 36 months 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.630
 - four agents per 20-2 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.550
 now I'll effect 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.619
 this multiplication minus two days than the two is plus 4 

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:14.870
 done that eliminated that conscious 6 - any that negative 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.739
 take care with Spain - 6-4 and goal 2 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.049
 subtracted the signal from the greater 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:24.089
 two more then 2 

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:25.879
 example number 4 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:32.209
 - two raised to the square added cohab apparent - and two she of 09 in the 6 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.829
 close parenthesis plus - two squared side equally 

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:41.059
 so first we are going to make this power to the power and this power 

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:45.859
 yes to be careful in those months and that by the following - 2 squared that is 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:48.490
 square is just the number 2 then 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:52.510
 was different said that the one that is the profit - 2 that is the square 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:58.309
 so they are alike but it is not my state at least two are square 

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:59.929
 - 4 

00:02:59.929 --> 00:03:02.419
 Is everything in one hour was equal to 1 

00:03:02.419 --> 00:03:07.899
 - whenever the same is called with less two squared here is less 

00:03:07.899 --> 00:03:11.079
 two civilians - two now more 4 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:14.079
 exponent park buzz negative the answer 

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:15.959
 positive 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.649
 if I observe here I was so high in the square here at the beginning that it was the 

00:03:19.649 --> 00:03:22.649
 number two and is not the number minus two 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:24.469
 10 

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:26.179
 now 

00:03:26.179 --> 00:03:28.400
 I cancel 1-4 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.509
 with four more stays 6min - or 

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:35.379
 - 5 are suspension exercise responses - and 

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:39.279
 5th clearest expression of 64 - 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:46.849
 now chess - yes which ones to 0 - with emits 2 - hello apparent - two to 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:48.789
 fifteen divided by fourth 

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:53.119
 the appearances and consciously the paraense - three to the body 

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:55.679
 dates to uneven 

00:03:55.679 --> 00:04:01.259
 so live to do what I can do to that power potencies without 

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:04.259
 hypotheses so root and power can do 

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:09.329
 where they meet, I'm going to do a scale of 64 

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:12.770
 is relevant 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:16.140
 the sweet orange - five caught 0-1 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.870
 it's no problem at all 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.939
 - cohab of bracket catheter 2 - it was chavez 

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:30.499
 - 2 she's here less than 2 times less 2 times - 2 - 2 5 consecutive time than 

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:34.749
 -32c west matters less 32 - wait here 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.890
 directed by 4 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:39.990
 I've told you what we'll do - three in a cube 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:45.419
 - 3 el kubra at least three times - three former ministers who is - 27/07 exponent 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:45.900
 impose 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.719
 negative answer 

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:52.819
 now class let's stop an exercise that 32 split fund 

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:54.860
 by 4 to 1 and remove 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.050
 this paradise here 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:02.499
 is the text repeats cccs repeated that 32 divided by four 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.819
 is equal to less eights to which less times less is the most not so it stayed more 

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:10.050
 eight 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.300
 r - multiplied by - deleted 46 you do not trade 

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:18.650
 in the traction distance protection and signal exchanged 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.129
 positive 

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:23.599
 now we will do two with eight 

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:28.139
 two are the poor thing eliminates is less than balance which is another plus 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:31.789
 slowed down - the rest I repeat 

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:34.370
 now do these operations that are 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:40.740
 into the waters then - let's add at least 10 is -1 11 - let's pack with 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.150
 27 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:49.699
 is equal to 16 positive eliminate gets less 16 poitou -16 angola - 8 then the 

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:51.289
 order is overrun 

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:52.680
 igor - 8
