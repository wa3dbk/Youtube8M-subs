remove<00:00:14.990> it<00:00:15.170> the<00:00:16.130> cup<00:00:16.430> make<00:00:17.270> sure<00:00:17.450> the<00:00:17.599> energy

00:00:18.249 --> 00:00:18.259 
remove it the cup make sure the energy

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:22.029 
remove it the cup make sure the energy
is<00:00:18.320> not<00:00:18.439> hot<00:00:18.680> and<00:00:20.080> you<00:00:21.080> have<00:00:21.230> to<00:00:21.380> open<00:00:21.800> the

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:22.039 
is not hot and you have to open the

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.550 
is not hot and you have to open the
valve<00:00:22.390> the<00:00:23.390> valve<00:00:23.420> is<00:00:24.430> located<00:00:25.430> underneath

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.560 
valve the valve is located underneath

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.890 
valve the valve is located underneath
would<00:00:27.560> let<00:00:27.740> me<00:00:27.859> show<00:00:28.010> you<00:00:28.070> how<00:00:28.660> so<00:00:29.660> you<00:00:29.689> go

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
would let me show you how so you go

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:38.729 
would let me show you how so you go
underneath<00:00:30.260> with<00:00:30.680> her

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:38.739 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:41.410 

basically<00:00:39.739> the<00:00:40.070> coolant<00:00:40.550> coming<00:00:40.850> from<00:00:41.180> this

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
basically the coolant coming from this

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.389 
basically the coolant coming from this
hole<00:00:41.660> first<00:00:42.050> to<00:00:42.200> the<00:00:42.320> bottle<00:00:42.770> I<00:00:42.950> wanted<00:00:43.309> to

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:43.399 
hole first to the bottle I wanted to

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:45.639 
hole first to the bottle I wanted to
call<00:00:43.579> it<00:00:43.610> the<00:00:43.790> water<00:00:43.969> and<00:00:44.390> the<00:00:45.050> valve<00:00:45.350> is

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:45.649 
call it the water and the valve is

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:58.680 
call it the water and the valve is
located<00:00:46.780> which<00:00:47.780> I<00:00:47.960> show<00:00:48.200> you

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.330 

like<00:00:59.690> in<00:00:59.870> here<00:01:00.230> where<00:01:00.530> I<00:01:00.559> point<00:01:00.949> it<00:01:01.040> with<00:01:01.190> my

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
like in here where I point it with my

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.640 
like in here where I point it with my
hand

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:05.650 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.080 

so<00:01:06.650> I<00:01:06.680> tattooed<00:01:07.100> evolve<00:01:07.460> and<00:01:07.670> you<00:01:07.760> see<00:01:07.940> that

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
so I tattooed evolve and you see that

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:14.070 
so I tattooed evolve and you see that
what<00:01:08.240> is<00:01:08.420> coming<00:01:08.630> up<00:01:08.840> in<00:01:09.620> the<00:01:09.770> book

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.320 

and<00:01:14.590> what<00:01:14.740> is<00:01:14.950> coming<00:01:15.130> up<00:01:18.210> so<00:01:19.210> they<00:01:19.300> don't

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
and what is coming up so they don't

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.450 
and what is coming up so they don't
overdo<00:01:19.810> the<00:01:19.930> value<00:01:22.530> now<00:01:23.530> to<00:01:23.590> empty<00:01:24.250> the

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
overdo the value now to empty the

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:30.000 
overdo the value now to empty the
reservoir<00:01:25.860> just<00:01:26.860> remove<00:01:27.250> this<00:01:27.990> cable<00:01:28.990> and<00:01:29.170> put

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.010 
reservoir just remove this cable and put

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.750 
reservoir just remove this cable and put
it<00:01:30.130> down

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:30.760 
it down

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.480 
it down
and<00:01:31.420> when<00:01:31.540> you<00:01:31.600> put<00:01:31.810> it<00:01:31.870> down<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.920> pressure<00:01:33.190> of

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
and when you put it down the pressure of

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.570 
and when you put it down the pressure of
the<00:01:33.670> water<00:01:33.840> of<00:01:34.840> the<00:01:34.990> reservoir<00:01:35.620> water<00:01:35.800> we

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
the water of the reservoir water we

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.500 
the water of the reservoir water we
automatically<00:01:37.710> empty<00:01:38.710> that<00:01:39.360> there's<00:01:40.360> no

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
automatically empty that there's no

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:41.490 
automatically empty that there's no
pores

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
pores

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:54.350 
pores
see<00:01:42.430> is<00:01:42.850> lik<00:01:47.310> just<00:01:48.310> like<00:01:48.460> a<00:01:49.080> limiter<00:01:52.140> leave<00:01:53.140> it

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
see is lik just like a limiter leave it

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.290 
see is lik just like a limiter leave it
and<00:01:55.360> that's<00:01:55.630> all<00:01:55.920> now<00:01:56.920> if<00:01:56.980> they<00:01:57.190> fill<00:01:57.580> out<00:01:57.760> with

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
and that's all now if they fill out with

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:04.230 
and that's all now if they fill out with
your<00:01:58.510> favorite<00:01:59.160> color<00:02:00.900> slowly<00:02:01.900> slowly<00:02:02.410> to<00:02:03.240> not

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
your favorite color slowly slowly to not

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:11.400 
your favorite color slowly slowly to not
over<00:02:04.810> them<00:02:08.910> also<00:02:09.910> try<00:02:10.480> to<00:02:10.510> double<00:02:10.929> check<00:02:10.990> after

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
over them also try to double check after

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.210 
over them also try to double check after
tooth<00:02:11.620> you<00:02:12.100> start<00:02:12.370> the<00:02:12.460> car

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
tooth you start the car

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.580 
tooth you start the car
because<00:02:15.220> are<00:02:15.370> much<00:02:15.550> water<00:02:15.850> going<00:02:16.330> to<00:02:16.450> the<00:02:17.410> air

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
because are much water going to the air

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:39.770 
because are much water going to the air
conditioning

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.460 

and<00:02:40.780> that's<00:02:41.620> me<00:02:41.800> so<00:02:42.570> close<00:02:43.570> double<00:02:43.840> check<00:02:44.020> few

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
and that's me so close double check few

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.740 
and that's me so close double check few
times
