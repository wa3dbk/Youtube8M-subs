okay<00:00:01.050> for<00:00:01.230> my<00:00:01.319> next<00:00:01.530> crazy<00:00:01.829> project<00:00:02.370> this<00:00:02.610> is<00:00:02.850> a

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
okay for my next crazy project this is a

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.900 
okay for my next crazy project this is a
3d<00:00:03.510> printed<00:00:03.990> record<00:00:04.290> lathe<00:00:04.830> so<00:00:05.700> there's<00:00:05.850> a

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
3d printed record lathe so there's a

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.670 
3d printed record lathe so there's a
stepper<00:00:06.180> motor<00:00:06.450> and<00:00:06.600> a<00:00:06.629> lead<00:00:06.839> screw<00:00:07.049> drive

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
stepper motor and a lead screw drive

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.930 
stepper motor and a lead screw drive
this<00:00:07.890> thing<00:00:08.160> as<00:00:08.910> it<00:00:09.630> cuts<00:00:09.900> and<00:00:10.340> jewel<00:00:11.340> on

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
this thing as it cuts and jewel on

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.670 
this thing as it cuts and jewel on
stereo<00:00:12.450> audio<00:00:12.719> track<00:00:13.130> into<00:00:14.130> this<00:00:14.219> CD<00:00:15.109> so<00:00:16.109> has

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
stereo audio track into this CD so has

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.939 
stereo audio track into this CD so has
two<00:00:17.480> modified<00:00:18.480> speakers<00:00:19.080> you<00:00:19.619> can<00:00:19.650> get<00:00:19.859> in

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
two modified speakers you can get in

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.550 
two modified speakers you can get in
there<00:00:20.130> and<00:00:20.160> see<00:00:20.400> that<00:00:20.430> and<00:00:21.350> there's<00:00:22.350> a<00:00:22.410> little

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
there and see that and there's a little

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.400 
there and see that and there's a little
sharpened<00:00:23.279> needle<00:00:23.609> on<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:23.850> end<00:00:24.000> there<00:00:24.410> and

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
sharpened needle on the end there and

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.000 
sharpened needle on the end there and
basically<00:00:25.740> stress<00:00:26.519> that<00:00:26.699> on<00:00:26.849> there<00:00:27.000> it<00:00:28.010> there

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
basically stress that on there it there

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.980 
basically stress that on there it there
we<00:00:29.160> can<00:00:29.310> see<00:00:29.550> I<00:00:30.090> hope<00:00:30.330> yep

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
we can see I hope yep

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.690 
we can see I hope yep
it<00:00:31.380> cuts<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:32.130> groove<00:00:33.980> just<00:00:34.980> like<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:35.460> normal

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
it cuts a groove just like a normal

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.959 
it cuts a groove just like a normal
record<00:00:36.059> would<00:00:36.390> have<00:00:37.309> so<00:00:38.309> it's<00:00:38.460> now<00:00:38.579> do<00:00:38.640> we<00:00:38.820> know

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
record would have so it's now do we know

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.860 
record would have so it's now do we know
that<00:00:39.000> drives<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.540> stepper<00:00:39.780> motor<00:00:40.760> 50<00:00:41.760> watt<00:00:41.940> fast

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
that drives a stepper motor 50 watt fast

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.529 
that drives a stepper motor 50 watt fast
the<00:00:43.079> amplifier<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.160> pre<00:00:44.789> emphasis<00:00:45.270> or

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
the amplifier and a pre emphasis or

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.590 
the amplifier and a pre emphasis or
emphasis<00:00:46.200> circuit<00:00:46.760> to<00:00:47.760> get<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:48.000> balanced<00:00:48.420> just

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
emphasis circuit to get it balanced just

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.420 
emphasis circuit to get it balanced just
lovely<00:00:48.870> that<00:00:49.260> has<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.500> sit<00:00:49.620> on<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.860> kettle<00:00:50.039> no

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
lovely that has to sit on the kettle no

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.840 
lovely that has to sit on the kettle no
not<00:00:50.610> really

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
not really

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.880 
not really
and<00:00:51.500> what<00:00:52.500> this<00:00:52.649> does<00:00:52.969> we<00:00:53.969> come<00:00:54.180> over<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.890> said

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
and what this does we come over to said

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:03.680 
and what this does we come over to said
playback<00:00:56.340> device<00:00:56.719> is<00:00:59.570> place<00:01:00.980> records<00:01:02.690> and

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
playback device is place records and

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.820 
playback device is place records and
just<00:01:03.870> this<00:01:04.320> organized<00:01:05.159> here<00:01:05.519> right<00:01:06.710> now<00:01:07.710> let's

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
just this organized here right now let's

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:22.020 
just this organized here right now let's
see<00:01:08.040> what<00:01:08.159> happens

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:28.450 

so<00:01:23.030> there<00:01:23.180> you<00:01:23.210> go<00:01:23.390> it<00:01:24.140> actually<00:01:24.710> plays<00:01:27.460> there

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
so there you go it actually plays there

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:29.700 
so there you go it actually plays there
it<00:01:28.550> goes

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
it goes

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:36.340 
it goes
in<00:01:30.710> stereo<00:01:33.250> need<00:01:34.250> to<00:01:34.340> work<00:01:34.520> on<00:01:34.729> the<00:01:35.200> bottom<00:01:36.200> end

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
in stereo need to work on the bottom end

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:50.260 
in stereo need to work on the bottom end
a<00:01:36.410> little<00:01:36.530> bit<00:01:36.680> but<00:01:37.030> still<00:01:38.030> it's<00:01:38.930> a<00:01:39.080> start

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.469 

there<00:01:51.110> you<00:01:51.200> go<00:01:51.380> we<00:01:51.890> can<00:01:52.009> increase<00:01:52.250> the<00:01:52.610> tracks

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
there you go we can increase the tracks

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.830 
there you go we can increase the tracks
per<00:01:53.780> inch<00:01:53.960> at<00:01:54.140> the<00:01:54.200> moment<00:01:54.560> it's<00:01:54.649> pretty

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
per inch at the moment it's pretty

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.359 
per inch at the moment it's pretty
pretty<00:01:56.840> quick<00:01:57.170> it<00:01:57.290> only<00:01:57.409> lasts<00:01:57.799> for<00:01:57.950> about<00:01:58.070> 30

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
pretty quick it only lasts for about 30

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:00.039 
pretty quick it only lasts for about 30
seconds<00:01:58.850> but<00:01:59.090> it<00:01:59.270> should<00:01:59.420> be<00:01:59.540> able<00:01:59.659> to<00:01:59.780> squeeze

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
seconds but it should be able to squeeze

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:03.429 
seconds but it should be able to squeeze
about<00:02:00.320> six<00:02:00.619> minutes<00:02:01.009> on<00:02:01.159> there<00:02:01.960> anyway<00:02:02.960> there

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
about six minutes on there anyway there

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:05.710 
about six minutes on there anyway there
you<00:02:03.470> go
