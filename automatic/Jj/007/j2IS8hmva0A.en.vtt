while it may appear that we only have
one<00:01:05.129> week<00:01:05.339> attack<00:01:05.640> against<00:01:06.060> our<00:01:06.150> dragon<00:01:06.570> kin

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
one week attack against our dragon kin

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.289 
one week attack against our dragon kin
keep<00:01:07.799> in<00:01:07.920> mind<00:01:08.159> that<00:01:08.310> that<00:01:08.490> emerald<00:01:08.790> presence

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
keep in mind that that emerald presence

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.750 
keep in mind that that emerald presence
is<00:01:09.510> shielding<00:01:10.200> further<00:01:10.530> from<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.400> batter's

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
is shielding further from the batter's

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.670 
is shielding further from the batter's
as<00:01:11.909> they<00:01:12.030> come<00:01:12.210> in<00:01:12.360> not<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.750> mention<00:01:12.960> the

that<00:01:16.770> may<00:01:16.890> have<00:01:17.070> been<00:01:17.189> done<00:01:17.400> on<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:17.670> round<00:01:18.950> so

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
that may have been done on that round so

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.679 
that may have been done on that round so
from<00:01:20.220> here<00:01:20.430> it's<00:01:20.610> just<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:21.000> simple<00:01:21.420> dance

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
from here it's just a simple dance

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.070 
from here it's just a simple dance
between<00:01:22.020> breath<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:23.450> reupping<00:01:24.450> our<00:01:24.659> emerald

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
between breath and reupping our emerald

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.649 
between breath and reupping our emerald
presence<00:01:25.409> when<00:01:25.650> we<00:01:25.770> have<00:01:25.950> two<00:01:26.630> followed<00:01:27.630> by

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
presence when we have two followed by

presence when we have two followed by
the<00:01:27.979> liftoff<00:01:28.979> if<00:01:29.369> we<00:01:29.670> can<00:01:29.820> get<00:01:29.939> it<00:01:30.090> off<00:01:30.210> again

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.139 

initially<00:01:47.500> I<00:01:47.710> had<00:01:47.740> chosen<00:01:48.189> chichi<00:01:48.820> for<00:01:49.030> this

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
initially I had chosen chichi for this

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:51.300 
initially I had chosen chichi for this
fight<00:01:49.360> particularly<00:01:50.079> for<00:01:50.350> that<00:01:50.560> mechanical<00:01:51.159> I

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
fight particularly for that mechanical I

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.700 
fight particularly for that mechanical I
don't<00:01:51.820> often<00:01:51.939> get<00:01:52.149> a<00:01:52.210> chance<00:01:52.299> to<00:01:52.840> show<00:01:53.049> off<00:01:53.079> her

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
don't often get a chance to show off her

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.969 
don't often get a chance to show off her
skills<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:55.450> her<00:01:55.600> evasion<00:01:56.200> is<00:01:56.350> very<00:01:56.680> powerful

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
skills the her evasion is very powerful

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:59.160 
skills the her evasion is very powerful
followed<00:01:57.850> with<00:01:58.000> a<00:01:58.030> heel<00:01:58.390> and<00:01:58.659> the<00:01:58.780> fact<00:01:59.020> that

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
followed with a heel and the fact that

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.420 
followed with a heel and the fact that
those<00:01:59.380> quills<00:01:59.710> are<00:01:59.860> strong<00:02:00.070> against<00:02:00.399> the

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
those quills are strong against the

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.410 
those quills are strong against the
mechanical<00:02:01.060> but<00:02:01.780> because<00:02:02.740> our<00:02:03.250> flyer<00:02:04.179> was

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
mechanical but because our flyer was

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.840 
mechanical but because our flyer was
coming<00:02:04.689> up<00:02:04.780> next<00:02:04.990> it<00:02:05.229> seemed<00:02:05.439> ideal<00:02:05.890> to<00:02:06.610> pick

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
coming up next it seemed ideal to pick

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.279 
coming up next it seemed ideal to pick
the<00:02:07.000> bronze<00:02:07.240> well<00:02:07.539> playing<00:02:07.810> as<00:02:07.960> it<00:02:08.170> was

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
the bronze well playing as it was

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.229 
the bronze well playing as it was
stronger<00:02:08.649> against<00:02:08.979> the<00:02:09.039> flyer<00:02:09.340> and<00:02:09.640> was<00:02:10.209> a

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
stronger against the flyer and was a

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:12.240 
stronger against the flyer and was a
double<00:02:10.660> speed<00:02:10.929> breed<00:02:11.290> so<00:02:11.500> it<00:02:11.620> was<00:02:11.769> going<00:02:12.010> to<00:02:12.130> go

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
double speed breed so it was going to go

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.240 
double speed breed so it was going to go
first<00:02:12.959> so<00:02:13.959> after<00:02:14.110> laying<00:02:14.440> down<00:02:14.680> the<00:02:14.830> arcane

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250
