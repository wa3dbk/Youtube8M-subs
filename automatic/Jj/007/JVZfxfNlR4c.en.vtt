00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 we started doing like six years good and 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.639
 to come out with these things then 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.650
 explain to us why they two 

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:13.469
 they remained the same if supposedly already 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.120
 Canada to come the same in what I say and 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.160
 it comes already another color that we explain 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.720
 now and the whole answer because we come 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.220

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.380

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.660
 organ brands and we're going to do everything 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.300
 what is in our hands to be able 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.890
 that the product does not return 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.140
 and tell yourself that you deserve it 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.520
 because if they comply because if you're 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.290
 doing everything possible to come the same 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.730
 and follow wheldon but this week already 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.290
 They are stored in the safe together 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.220
 with the ports and now it's one of those 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.840
 win garden producer 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:45.490
 onwards but we are here 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:49.300
 fulfilling so that it is staying 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:52.070
 I feel very lonely, do not think I have 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.220
 I have my team and very well very strong 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.220
 so 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:02.500
 so they can see it later on and 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.500
 after putting the others 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:12.900
 to make the little sisters of the girls 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.850
 in two groups 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:32.110
 this separation is from god what is going to 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.020
 spend with the little sisters just like 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.670
 good if we're going to make two teams that 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.600
 we'll see who does it best and who 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.600
 It really is the one that deserves 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.340
 what do you think? 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.640

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.640

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.610
 let's see what Tory can do 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.440
 obviously those that remain as leaders 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:00.600
 they have to manage a quality 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.600
 unparalleled there if it can not be equal 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.970
