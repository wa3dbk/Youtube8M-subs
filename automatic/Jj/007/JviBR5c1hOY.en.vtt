00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:22.520 
driving the new 2008 YZ 450 we made a

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.190 
driving the new 2008 YZ 450 we made a
host<00:00:22.849> of<00:00:23.029> changes<00:00:23.390> of<00:00:23.480> the<00:00:23.540> bike<00:00:23.720> this<00:00:23.930> year

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:24.200 
host of changes of the bike this year

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.049 
host of changes of the bike this year
it's<00:00:24.739> basically<00:00:24.980> got<00:00:25.189> a<00:00:25.220> brand<00:00:25.520> new<00:00:25.610> front<00:00:25.939> end

00:00:26.049 --> 00:00:26.059 
it's basically got a brand new front end

00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:27.700 
it's basically got a brand new front end
from<00:00:26.239> the<00:00:26.329> forks<00:00:26.779> to<00:00:26.930> the<00:00:27.020> triple<00:00:27.259> clamps<00:00:27.619> to

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710 
from the forks to the triple clamps to

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.889 
from the forks to the triple clamps to
the<00:00:27.800> steering<00:00:28.070> stem<00:00:28.309> to<00:00:28.489> the<00:00:28.579> front<00:00:28.820> tire<00:00:29.090> from

00:00:29.889 --> 00:00:29.899 
the steering stem to the front tire from

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:31.479 
the steering stem to the front tire from
break<00:00:30.230> everything<00:00:30.649> it's<00:00:30.919> a<00:00:31.009> lot<00:00:31.219> lighter

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:31.489 
break everything it's a lot lighter

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:33.280 
break everything it's a lot lighter
makes<00:00:31.880> the<00:00:31.969> bike<00:00:32.119> turn<00:00:32.360> a<00:00:32.390> lot<00:00:32.689> better<00:00:32.840> handle

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290 
makes the bike turn a lot better handle

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:34.750 
makes the bike turn a lot better handle
a<00:00:33.320> lot<00:00:33.470> better<00:00:33.620> so<00:00:33.860> that's<00:00:34.010> a<00:00:34.100> big<00:00:34.340> change<00:00:34.550> for

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
a lot better so that's a big change for

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:43.080 
a lot better so that's a big change for
this<00:00:34.880> year

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.090 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.340 

on<00:00:44.090> the<00:00:44.270> rear<00:00:44.450> we<00:00:44.629> have<00:00:44.719> a<00:00:44.750> new<00:00:44.930> linkage

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
on the rear we have a new linkage

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:46.900 
on the rear we have a new linkage
basically<00:00:45.950> makes<00:00:46.129> the<00:00:46.220> bike<00:00:46.399> handle<00:00:46.730> better

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
basically makes the bike handle better

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.280 
basically makes the bike handle better
out<00:00:47.090> of<00:00:47.120> corners<00:00:47.480> acceleration<00:00:48.020> bumps

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:48.290 
out of corners acceleration bumps

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.380 
out of corners acceleration bumps
absorbs<00:00:48.770> the<00:00:48.890> bumps<00:00:49.129> better<00:00:49.340> we<00:00:50.120> went<00:00:50.239> to<00:00:50.300> a

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
absorbs the bumps better we went to a

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.200 
absorbs the bumps better we went to a
wide<00:00:50.690> retire<00:00:51.110> a<00:00:51.140> 120<00:00:51.829> eighty<00:00:52.010> nineteen<00:00:52.489> to<00:00:53.059> get

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
wide retire a 120 eighty nineteen to get

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.460 
wide retire a 120 eighty nineteen to get
the<00:00:53.329> most<00:00:53.510> traction<00:00:53.629> as<00:00:54.110> humanly<00:00:54.410> possible

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:54.470 
the most traction as humanly possible

00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:05.079 
the most traction as humanly possible
out<00:00:54.890> of<00:00:54.920> the<00:00:55.040> bike

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:07.149 

also<00:01:05.840> this<00:01:05.960> year<00:01:06.170> we<00:01:06.289> went<00:01:06.439> to<00:01:06.530> an<00:01:06.619> extremely

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
also this year we went to an extremely

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:09.130 
also this year we went to an extremely
short<00:01:07.490> rear<00:01:07.820> silencer<00:01:08.090> helps<00:01:08.960> with<00:01:09.079> the

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
short rear silencer helps with the

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.810 
short rear silencer helps with the
centralization<00:01:09.859> of<00:01:09.950> mass<00:01:10.130> basically<00:01:10.670> it's<00:01:10.789> a

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
centralization of mass basically it's a

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.090 
centralization of mass basically it's a
lot<00:01:11.000> lighter<00:01:11.240> than<00:01:11.479> last<00:01:11.539> year's<00:01:12.079> that's<00:01:12.920> kind

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
lot lighter than last year's that's kind

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.069 
lot lighter than last year's that's kind
of<00:01:13.130> a<00:01:13.219> unique<00:01:13.369> dual<00:01:13.729> cone<00:01:13.969> set<00:01:14.270> up<00:01:14.390> to<00:01:14.929> make<00:01:15.020> the

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:15.079 
of a unique dual cone set up to make the

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:16.929 
of a unique dual cone set up to make the
sound<00:01:15.380> less<00:01:15.679> than<00:01:15.859> last<00:01:16.009> year<00:01:16.189> to<00:01:16.280> pass<00:01:16.460> am<00:01:16.819> a

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:16.939 
sound less than last year to pass am a

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:19.959 
sound less than last year to pass am a
stricter<00:01:17.390> sound<00:01:17.630> requirements<00:01:18.609> we<00:01:19.609> also<00:01:19.759> went

00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:19.969 
stricter sound requirements we also went

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:21.279 
stricter sound requirements we also went
with<00:01:20.090> really<00:01:20.359> wide<00:01:20.509> foot<00:01:20.750> pegs<00:01:20.929> this<00:01:21.140> year

00:01:21.279 --> 00:01:21.289 
with really wide foot pegs this year

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:22.929 
with really wide foot pegs this year
basically<00:01:21.530> straight<00:01:21.920> off<00:01:22.069> the<00:01:22.100> race<00:01:22.340> team<00:01:22.610> so
