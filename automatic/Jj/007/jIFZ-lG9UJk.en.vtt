00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
repeats so after that turn around you

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.980 
repeats so after that turn around you

get another verse another turn around

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.430 
get another verse another turn around
and<00:00:43.640> then<00:00:43.760> we<00:00:43.880> move<00:00:44.060> on<00:00:44.270> to<00:00:44.420> the<00:00:44.750> pre-chorus

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
and then we move on to the pre-chorus

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.970 
and then we move on to the pre-chorus
and<00:00:45.800> the<00:00:46.670> pre-core<00:00:47.030> is<00:00:47.120> this<00:00:47.240> plate<00:00:47.450> like<00:00:47.660> this

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:47.980 
and the pre-core is this plate like this

00:00:47.980 --> 00:01:05.359 
and the pre-core is this plate like this
three<00:00:49.060> four

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.139 

and<00:01:05.969> when<00:01:06.869> it<00:01:06.960> comes<00:01:07.079> to<00:01:07.289> speed<00:01:07.740> is<00:01:07.979> it's<00:01:08.490> quite

00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:09.149 
and when it comes to speed is it's quite

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:11.450 
and when it comes to speed is it's quite
a<00:01:09.179> bit<00:01:09.390> faster<00:01:09.570> than<00:01:09.929> that<00:01:10.140> so<00:01:10.979> it's<00:01:11.159> more<00:01:11.280> like

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
a bit faster than that so it's more like

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:30.870 
a bit faster than that so it's more like
this

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.910 

and<00:01:31.450> that's<00:01:31.659> that's<00:01:32.049> also<00:01:32.380> the<00:01:32.590> chorus

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
and that's that's also the chorus

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.240 
and that's that's also the chorus
afterwards<00:01:33.400> so<00:01:34.180> that<00:01:34.780> pre-chorus<00:01:35.590> the<00:01:36.009> course

in third position of the E string then

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.130 
in third position of the E string then
the<00:03:29.960> g7<00:03:30.560> chord<00:03:30.770> is<00:03:31.460> played<00:03:31.490> on<00:03:31.940> g7<00:03:32.360> first

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
and that's pretty much it so there you

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.220 
and that's pretty much it so there you
also<00:03:45.400> have<00:03:45.730> a<00:03:45.910> picking<00:03:46.209> pattern<00:03:46.240> but<00:03:46.750> this

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:49.240 
picking pattern only lasts for half a

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.020 
picking pattern only lasts for half a
bar<00:03:49.510> and<00:03:49.780> then<00:03:50.140> it's<00:03:50.319> repeated<00:03:50.740> already<00:03:51.069> so<00:03:51.819> it

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
bar and then it's repeated already so it

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.350 
bar and then it's repeated already so it
goes<00:03:52.180> like<00:03:52.240> this

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
goes like this

00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:01.350 
goes like this
three<00:03:55.360> four<00:03:59.670> that's<00:04:00.670> it<00:04:01.000> and<00:04:01.180> then<00:04:01.300> you

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
three four that's it and then you

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.850 
three four that's it and then you
already<00:04:01.450> move<00:04:01.780> to<00:04:01.930> the<00:04:02.080> next<00:04:02.230> chord<00:04:02.560> and<00:04:02.770> you

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
already move to the next chord and you

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.500 
already move to the next chord and you
repeat<00:04:03.190> the<00:04:03.340> same<00:04:03.520> picking<00:04:03.760> pattern<00:04:03.850> so<00:04:04.300> once

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
repeat the same picking pattern so once

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:11.050 
repeat the same picking pattern so once
more<00:04:04.830> three<00:04:05.830> four

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.030 

now<00:04:11.540> you<00:04:11.600> play<00:04:11.780> the<00:04:11.930> same<00:04:12.170> picking<00:04:12.470> pattern<00:04:12.590> on

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
now you play the same picking pattern on

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:20.979 
now you play the same picking pattern on
a<00:04:13.610> strumming<00:04:14.030> pattern<00:04:14.240> on<00:04:14.390> the<00:04:14.480> g7<00:04:15.670> 3/4

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:27.779 

and<00:04:21.470> the<00:04:21.680> same<00:04:21.919> on<00:04:22.100> the<00:04:22.190> D<00:04:22.340> minor<00:04:22.580> three<00:04:23.210> for<00:04:23.990> a

00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:27.789 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:31.540 

minor

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.850 

and<00:04:32.120> those<00:04:32.330> are<00:04:32.450> already<00:04:32.780> the<00:04:33.080> first<00:04:33.350> two<00:04:33.620> bars

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
and those are already the first two bars

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.740 
and those are already the first two bars
of<00:04:34.040> that<00:04:34.190> course<00:04:34.460> so<00:04:34.640> let's<00:04:34.820> try<00:04:35.090> to<00:04:35.120> do<00:04:35.600> those

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
of that course so let's try to do those

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:46.700 
of that course so let's try to do those
bars<00:04:36.500> together<00:04:36.680> a<00:04:37.190> bit<00:04:38.060> more<00:04:38.870> slow<00:04:39.640> three<00:04:40.640> four

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:05:01.469 

yeah

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:01.479 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:03.850 

as<00:05:02.479> you<00:05:02.689> notice<00:05:03.050> because<00:05:03.229> I<00:05:03.469> played<00:05:03.740> it

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860 
as you notice because I played it

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.390 
as you notice because I played it
through<00:05:04.750> the<00:05:05.750> last<00:05:06.110> two<00:05:06.439> bars<00:05:06.710> of<00:05:06.860> that<00:05:07.129> course

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
through the last two bars of that course

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.499 
through the last two bars of that course
are<00:05:07.729> slightly<00:05:08.569> different<00:05:09.729> so<00:05:10.729> that<00:05:10.909> third<00:05:11.180> bar

00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:11.509 
are slightly different so that third bar

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:14.290 
are slightly different so that third bar
starts<00:05:12.080> again<00:05:12.710> with<00:05:12.919> that<00:05:13.069> C<00:05:13.370> chord<00:05:13.639> and<00:05:14.240> you

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
starts again with that C chord and you

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:19.059 
starts again with that C chord and you
play<00:05:14.479> down<00:05:15.550> down<00:05:16.550> down<00:05:17.650> that's<00:05:18.650> still<00:05:18.949> the

00:05:19.059 --> 00:05:19.069 
play down down down that's still the

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:22.990 
play down down down that's still the
same<00:05:19.099> that<00:05:19.460> you<00:05:19.550> play<00:05:19.699> that<00:05:19.819> g7

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.140 

and<00:05:23.090> then<00:05:23.810> on<00:05:24.020> the<00:05:24.170> fourth<00:05:24.380> beat<00:05:24.530> you<00:05:25.310> mute<00:05:25.970> the

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
and then on the fourth beat you mute the

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.620 
and then on the fourth beat you mute the
strings<00:05:26.480> and<00:05:26.920> then<00:05:27.920> on<00:05:28.100> the<00:05:28.220> four<00:05:28.520> and<00:05:28.760> you

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:29.630 
strings and then on the four and you

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.410 
strings and then on the four and you
play<00:05:29.870> the<00:05:30.020> D<00:05:30.170> minor<00:05:30.410> chord<00:05:30.790> and<00:05:31.790> I<00:05:31.910> play<00:05:32.150> with<00:05:32.390> a

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:32.420 
play the D minor chord and I play with a

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:35.880 
play the D minor chord and I play with a
Down<00:05:32.630> stroke<00:05:33.100> like<00:05:34.100> this<00:05:34.370> from<00:05:35.000> that<00:05:35.060> g7<00:05:35.690> chord

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:35.890 
Down stroke like this from that g7 chord

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:44.530 
Down stroke like this from that g7 chord
one<00:05:36.890> two<00:05:37.790> down

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:44.540 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:48.250 

and<00:05:45.400> that<00:05:46.400> sums<00:05:46.700> up<00:05:46.850> those<00:05:47.090> last<00:05:47.480> two<00:05:47.780> bars<00:05:48.020> so

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:48.260 
and that sums up those last two bars so

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:49.840 
and that sums up those last two bars so
let's<00:05:48.440> try<00:05:48.680> to<00:05:48.740> play<00:05:48.950> those<00:05:49.160> last<00:05:49.520> two<00:05:49.670> bars

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:49.850 
let's try to play those last two bars

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:56.810 
let's try to play those last two bars
together<00:05:50.470> three<00:05:51.470> four

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:56.820 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:03.710 

mute

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.820 

all<00:06:04.720> right<00:06:04.840> so<00:06:04.990> let's<00:06:05.170> try<00:06:05.290> to<00:06:05.380> play<00:06:05.590> that

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:05.830 
all right so let's try to play that

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:21.869 
all right so let's try to play that
course<00:06:06.250> together<00:06:06.580> slowly<00:06:07.650> three<00:06:08.650> four

00:06:21.869 --> 00:06:21.879 

00:06:21.879 --> 00:06:24.480 

yeah
