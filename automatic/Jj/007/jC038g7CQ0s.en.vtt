00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 That's it. 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.120
 Talk about how you and I need 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.120
 you must have heard something from the 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.550
 kind it is impossible to progress without change 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.420
 So what are you changing to? 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.420
 progress in life 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:25.330
 ah ah ahhh yes 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.309
 Welcome to the fourth event I am 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.019
 I like henrique is a mess 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.089
 how could you come but time of 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:02.500
 vacation sorry ragged in this 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:04.089
 video you are recording with two 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.490
 cameras as you could see talking 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.380
 here and now I'm speaking here in 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.540
 second camera that will take a mode 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.880
 the more open on the second 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:16.830
 first in the first in the first 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:22.450
 Monday to Monday always always the same 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:24.310
 first and who already accompanies the videos 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.020
 must have realized that the younger brother and 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:51.070
 sometimes it appears here in the video stayed 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:52.720
 dude here and I do not know why he did 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.210
 This he told me that simply 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.430
 felt at ease there and did shave the 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.220
 hair but I have my doubts about 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.290
 the real reason is that it was because he 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.640
 wanted to look like vin diesel or 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.250
 is he suffering from a 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:09.280
 baldness or it may also be that 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.650
 he joined a group of skinhead is 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.040
 planning something against me or 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.040
 not 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:24.370
 william no no and no no, I do not know 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.350
 shaving the hair is not an event 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.750
 great but that made me think about 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.820
 things brother for some reason not 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.950
 I wanted to stay as little as I did. 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.500
 I try to motivate to do video and 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.200
 as well as promotion funnel 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.950
 armstrong studying engineering 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:45.310
 da vinci aerospace began to paint 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.140
 who did this and even for some 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.320
 reason had broken and decided to be 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.750
 musician worked on the globe 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.130
 these are common attitudes but they are 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.710
 can bring a surprising result 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.630
 in the future irrespective of the reason 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:00.910
 a different attitude is not something so 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.530
 simple and easy, we often do not 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.880
 has the courage to do so because there 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.650
 that fear than others and not 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.750
 thinking this way there is that fear of 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.450
 It seems strange that this reason for 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.160
 its action and then an idea or even a 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.690
 dream is set aside 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.270
 I personally find it very interesting. 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.489
 people are different and nobody is 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:21.760
 just like every person has his way 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:24.400
 opinion your personality then fear 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:28.000
 to be different he kind of becomes 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:30.280
 something meaningless knows that attitude that 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.380
 it seems strange at the moment it can change 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.730
 completely your life in the future I do not 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.100
 I'm satisfied with my condition 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.840
 and I always want to 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.090
 everybody this is normal 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.340
 every change in every discovery the people 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.080
 finds a new idea a new way 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.450
 and we learn from it, this is how 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:50.260
 Did you already see the ad that ended at the end? 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:53.980

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:57.930
 painting or the mona lisa chuck show 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.930
 berry did some songs there 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:06.930
 but not living in the same way is one of the 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.000
 features for you to be creative 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.550
