00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:01.660
 the team polymyxins 

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:05.800
 It is specially designed for those two or three products 

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:09.839
 components of very short life and with very low mixing percentages 

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:13.529
 as they can be from 2% to one hundred percent 

00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:17.949
 when performing the dosing in fan both products we get that the 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:20.509
 blend is perfect and homogeneous 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:24.719
 the dosage is made by pressures of the products to a 

00:00:24.719 --> 00:00:26.439
 certain viscosity 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.749
 It is totally reliable and safe without the need for electronic devices or 

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:32.600
 complex equipment 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.370
 as you can see in the images the gun has been suitable for the 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.000
 external dosage 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.210
 It is highly light and easy to use without the need of a tool 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.490
 we have manual and automatic gun for robots and facilities 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.100
 automatic 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.780
 Because the mixture is external, we do not run risks at any time 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.170
 that the product catalyzes in the hoses or in the equipment 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.660
 the mixture is always fresh 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.980
 of the three application systems that are known one of them is the system 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:03.980
 airlines 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:09.260
 consisting of high product pressure between 70 and 300 bar and without air 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.770
 by not carrying it you get that the particles are thick and we have to 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.970
 load the piece to be painted so that these particles join with each other 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.010
 as an advantage we have that by not applying air we do not have the charged environment 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.370
 because the dust that was believed is a heavy dust and almost immediately after 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:28.430
 ground 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.360
 another system is the traffic system 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.910
 that without air we can not spray due to the low pressure of the product 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.230
 it is this system of finest atomization that is known and is also the one 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.090
 more pollutes the environment in the work area 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.720
 with finishes on the painted parts of very high quality 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.970
 and the last system that is known is the mix tour as it is also known to go 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:51.790
 mix 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.950
 which consists of combining the two previous systems as in the church 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.840
 the airbrush ico and it works as follows 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.320
 The product pressure ranges between 15 and 70 bar and the air pressure between 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.680
 zero eat five horns maximum bars getting absence of dust in the 

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:13.539
 environment and an atomization almost as fine as the airbrushing system co 

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:17.639
 This is the system that has been best suited in our pol imex team 

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:21.199
 external mixture getting that by taking a little air the 

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:25.259
 homogenization is perfect the product speed and air are what 

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:26.609
 lowest possible 

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:28.899
 getting the minimum rebound and receipt
