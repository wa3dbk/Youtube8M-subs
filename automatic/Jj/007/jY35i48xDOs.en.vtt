means<00:02:42.690> I'm<00:02:42.900> guessing<00:02:43.319> a<00:02:43.380> general<00:02:43.800> and<00:02:43.950> army

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370

status<00:02:44.610> or<00:02:45.000> something<00:02:45.300> or<00:02:45.390> military<00:02:45.810> but<00:02:46.350> I

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
status or something or military but I

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.470 
status or something or military but I
don't<00:02:46.620> know<00:02:46.739> how<00:02:46.950> strong<00:02:47.010> a<00:02:47.370> general<00:02:47.970> class<00:02:48.209> is

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
don't know how strong a general class is

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.080 
don't know how strong a general class is
but<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:49.200> having<00:02:49.709> general<00:02:50.280> brought<00:02:50.550> up<00:02:50.760> into

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
but the having general brought up into

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.520 
but the having general brought up into
the<00:02:51.209> discussion<00:02:51.720> it's<00:02:52.140> ridiculous

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
the discussion it's ridiculous

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.620 
the discussion it's ridiculous
and<00:02:52.830> of<00:02:52.950> itself<00:02:53.310> since<00:02:53.940> it<00:02:54.090> is<00:02:54.209> taught<00:02:54.420> to<00:02:54.570> me

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
and of itself since it is taught to me

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.060 
and of itself since it is taught to me
our<00:02:54.720> main<00:02:54.870> character<00:02:55.290> so<00:02:55.440> he<00:02:55.590> definitely<00:02:55.739> is

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
our main character so he definitely is

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.009 
our main character so he definitely is
strong<00:02:56.400> and<00:02:56.760> so<00:02:57.180> I<00:02:57.209> wonder<00:02:57.510> exactly<00:02:57.900> how

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
strong and so I wonder exactly how

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:00.170 
strong and so I wonder exactly how
strong<00:02:58.410> the<00:02:58.590> general<00:02:58.920> class<00:02:59.130> is<00:02:59.400> that's

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
strong the general class is that's

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.580 
strong the general class is that's
pretty<00:03:00.390> much<00:03:00.660> all<00:03:00.959> day

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590

everything<00:03:08.010> felt<00:03:08.250> correctly<00:03:08.880> in<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:09.180> pacing

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
everything felt correctly in the pacing

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.300 
everything felt correctly in the pacing
felt<00:03:09.780> right<00:03:10.050> and<00:03:10.320> pretty<00:03:10.920> much<00:03:11.040> all<00:03:11.250> the

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
felt right and pretty much all the

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.610 
felt right and pretty much all the
dialogue<00:03:11.850> in<00:03:12.090> the<00:03:12.360> second<00:03:12.840> chapter<00:03:13.019> was

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
dialogue in the second chapter was

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.130 
dialogue in the second chapter was
adapted<00:03:14.130> properly<00:03:14.640> in<00:03:14.820> Episode<00:03:15.420> two<00:03:15.450> of<00:03:15.630> what

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
adapted properly in Episode two of what

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.560 
adapted properly in Episode two of what
they<00:03:16.290> did<00:03:16.500> adapt<00:03:16.890> and<00:03:17.220> so<00:03:17.670> I<00:03:17.700> feel<00:03:18.090> like<00:03:18.120> the

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
they did adapt and so I feel like the

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.660 
they did adapt and so I feel like the
main<00:03:18.810> issue<00:03:19.170> with<00:03:19.590> chapter<00:03:19.980> 10<00:03:20.010> why<00:03:20.280> a<00:03:20.310> lot<00:03:20.549> of

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
main issue with chapter 10 why a lot of

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.640 
main issue with chapter 10 why a lot of
fans<00:03:20.880> probably<00:03:21.120> be<00:03:21.420> upset<00:03:21.600> is<00:03:22.140> because<00:03:22.500> they

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
fans probably be upset is because they

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.110 
fans probably be upset is because they
skipped<00:03:22.920> the<00:03:23.010> entire<00:03:23.250> introduction<00:03:23.910> to<00:03:24.000> the

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
skipped the entire introduction to the

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.400 
skipped the entire introduction to the
different<00:03:24.239> powers<00:03:24.690> of<00:03:24.870> the<00:03:24.959> night<00:03:25.170> raids

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
different powers of the night raids

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.140 
different powers of the night raids
characters<00:03:26.040> but<00:03:26.459> here's<00:03:26.670> the<00:03:26.820> thing<00:03:27.000> okay

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
characters but here's the thing okay

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.150 
characters but here's the thing okay
they<00:03:27.510> can<00:03:27.660> easily<00:03:27.900> correct<00:03:28.440> this<00:03:28.950> and

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
they can easily correct this and

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.590 
they can easily correct this and
introduce<00:03:29.370> these<00:03:29.700> powers<00:03:30.000> later<00:03:30.209> on<00:03:30.420> and

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
introduce these powers later on and

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.300 
introduce these powers later on and
upcoming<00:03:30.930> thoughts<00:03:31.350> so<00:03:31.829> I<00:03:31.860> don't<00:03:32.070> see<00:03:32.190> how

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
upcoming thoughts so I don't see how

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.060 
upcoming thoughts so I don't see how
this<00:03:32.489> can<00:03:32.700> really<00:03:32.970> be<00:03:33.090> a<00:03:33.239> main<00:03:33.510> issue<00:03:34.070> overall

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
this can really be a main issue overall

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.039 
this can really be a main issue overall
though<00:03:35.310> it<00:03:35.549> was<00:03:35.820> a<00:03:35.850> good<00:03:36.120> chapter<00:03:36.390> and<00:03:36.660> overall

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
though it was a good chapter and overall

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.410 
though it was a good chapter and overall
episode<00:03:37.590> 2<00:03:37.769> was<00:03:38.100> a<00:03:38.130> good<00:03:38.459> episode<00:03:38.640> I<00:03:39.209> don't

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
episode 2 was a good episode I don't

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.000 
episode 2 was a good episode I don't
feel<00:03:39.660> like<00:03:39.900> there's<00:03:40.230> any<00:03:40.410> problem<00:03:40.890> with

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
feel like there's any problem with

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.650 
feel like there's any problem with
episode<00:03:41.430> 2<00:03:41.459> after<00:03:41.970> finding<00:03:42.180> out<00:03:42.390> about<00:03:42.480> these

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
episode 2 after finding out about these

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.840 
episode 2 after finding out about these
powers<00:03:43.049> because<00:03:43.650> it's<00:03:43.829> not<00:03:44.040> something<00:03:44.370> so

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
powers because it's not something so

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.030 
powers because it's not something so
major<00:03:45.209> that<00:03:45.900> I<00:03:45.930> mean<00:03:46.260> everybody<00:03:46.709> should<00:03:46.950> be

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
major that I mean everybody should be

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.890 
major that I mean everybody should be
mad<00:03:47.280> about<00:03:47.459> that<00:03:47.730> they<00:03:47.880> skipped<00:03:48.299> and<00:03:48.690> so<00:03:48.870> I

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
mad about that they skipped and so I

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.080 
mad about that they skipped and so I
still<00:03:49.290> believe<00:03:49.500> a<00:03:49.530> lot<00:03:49.769> 400%<00:03:50.730> there's<00:03:50.970> no

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
still believe a lot 400% there's no

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.850 
still believe a lot 400% there's no
problems<00:03:51.600> here<00:03:51.900> there's<00:03:52.350> the<00:03:52.440> one<00:03:52.560> thing<00:03:52.739> I'm

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
problems here there's the one thing I'm

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.890 
problems here there's the one thing I'm
waiting<00:03:53.160> for<00:03:53.190> it's<00:03:53.549> a<00:03:53.700> big<00:03:53.910> reveal<00:03:54.269> on<00:03:54.480> what

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
waiting for it's a big reveal on what

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.390 
waiting for it's a big reveal on what
the<00:03:55.019> hell<00:03:55.230> is<00:03:55.380> a<00:03:55.410> general<00:03:55.860> class<00:03:56.070> that's<00:03:56.310> the

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
the hell is a general class that's the

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.699 
the hell is a general class that's the
big<00:03:56.519> question<00:03:56.850> right<00:03:56.970> there<00:03:57.269> overall<00:03:58.170> the<00:03:58.410> art

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
big question right there overall the art

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.830 
big question right there overall the art
style<00:03:59.070> of<00:03:59.280> the<00:03:59.430> manga<00:03:59.850> looks<00:04:00.090> once<00:04:00.570> again

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
style of the manga looks once again

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.350 
style of the manga looks once again
vastly<00:04:01.380> different<00:04:01.950> from<00:04:02.250> the<00:04:02.459> anime<00:04:02.940> and<00:04:03.239> I

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
vastly different from the anime and I

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.420 
vastly different from the anime and I
will<00:04:03.510> say<00:04:03.660> the<00:04:03.780> anime<00:04:04.140> really<00:04:04.709> complements

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
will say the anime really complements

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.849 
will say the anime really complements
this<00:04:05.850> manga<00:04:06.510> and<00:04:06.690> now<00:04:07.140> that's<00:04:07.350> why<00:04:07.470> I<00:04:07.500> love<00:04:07.769> the

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:07.859 
this manga and now that's why I love the

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:09.500 
this manga and now that's why I love the
anime<00:04:08.130> so<00:04:08.280> much<00:04:08.430> so<00:04:08.640> far<00:04:08.880> from<00:04:09.060> the<00:04:09.209> different

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
anime so much so far from the different

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.390 
anime so much so far from the different
standpoints<00:04:09.989> I've<00:04:10.170> seen<00:04:10.530> I<00:04:10.739> am<00:04:10.859> enjoying<00:04:11.190> the

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
standpoints I've seen I am enjoying the

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.250 
standpoints I've seen I am enjoying the
anime<00:04:11.820> a<00:04:11.850> lot<00:04:12.120> more<00:04:12.329> than<00:04:12.510> the<00:04:12.570> manga<00:04:12.870> not

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
anime a lot more than the manga not

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.080 
anime a lot more than the manga not
because<00:04:13.560> I<00:04:13.680> hate<00:04:13.890> the<00:04:14.100> manga<00:04:14.459> or<00:04:14.790> it's<00:04:14.940> because

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
because I hate the manga or it's because

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.960 
because I hate the manga or it's because
it's<00:04:15.390> the<00:04:15.480> exact<00:04:15.810> same<00:04:15.870> it's<00:04:16.530> because<00:04:16.620> of<00:04:17.459> when

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
it's the exact same it's because of when

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:19.759 
it's the exact same it's because of when
an<00:04:18.090> anime<00:04:18.479> gets<00:04:18.660> adapted<00:04:18.900> it's<00:04:19.260> supposed<00:04:19.620> to

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
an anime gets adapted it's supposed to

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.370 
an anime gets adapted it's supposed to
be<00:04:20.099> better<00:04:20.459> than<00:04:20.940> the<00:04:21.180> manga<00:04:21.720> that<00:04:21.930> is<00:04:22.140> the

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
be better than the manga that is the

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.290 
be better than the manga that is the
main<00:04:22.710> goal<00:04:22.740> of<00:04:23.430> an<00:04:23.610> anime<00:04:24.000> it's

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
main goal of an anime it's

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.480 
main goal of an anime it's
to<00:04:24.509> be<00:04:24.660> better<00:04:25.349> than<00:04:25.770> its<00:04:25.919> original<00:04:26.009> source

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
to be better than its original source

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.659 
to be better than its original source
and<00:04:26.910> so<00:04:27.449> anime<00:04:28.289> is<00:04:28.470> doing<00:04:28.770> its<00:04:28.919> job<00:04:29.160> it's<00:04:29.460> doing

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:31.460 
and so anime is doing its job it's doing
this<00:04:29.729> job<00:04:29.910> it's<00:04:30.120> adapting<00:04:30.629> these<00:04:30.810> panels<00:04:31.319> by
