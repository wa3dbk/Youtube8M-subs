00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.850
 cadena3 the most open television that 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.890
 never very common in Lent 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:10.260
 potato pancakes with tuna in sauce 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:14.370
 tomato are delicious very simple 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:17.160
 you require two mashed potatoes 150 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.070
 grams of drained tuna 2 scallions 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.789
 chopped cambrai 2 tablespoons cilantro 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.789
 chopped salt and pepper a smoothie bread 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:30.060
 ground and for the sauce 2 cooked tomatoes 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:33.540
 half a cup of tomato puree a chile 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.760
 serrano cooked a quarter of onion a 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.399
 garlic clove half a cup of broth 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.270
 chicken and it's all that you require to 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:45.270
 I love ketchup is so 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.559
 simple and it goes very well I think with the 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.629
 potato and tuna are very very flavors 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:54.270
 simple and sometimes but the food is 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.300
 very much appreciates that then we're going to 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.879
 Start with tomato sauce that I have 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.500
 the cooked tomatoes and a Serrano chili 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.540
 if you do not with the spicy good you 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.850
 put none but a chilito 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.860
 Excellent acquaintance can take away the 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:12.470
 skin or you can leave it because we're going 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:15.200
 to strain then goes for the blender 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:18.290
 tomato puree that I know will give 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:23.300
 that consistency that we like so much 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:28.100
 raw onion and garlic let's put broth 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:31.030
 of chicken and we liquefy a basic sauce of 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:34.210
 simple tomato 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.830
 we are going to clean very well approximately 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:40.650
 some 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.650
 so that the salsita is very silky 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.950
 here I will stop but you continue to read 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:50.009
 when it is extremely silky and 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.560
 do not leave us so much sediment here in 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.899
 our colander let's strain it so that 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.530
 It is as I say very silky soft 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:02.100
 and see the color is already saying what 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:05.789
 flavor is going to have everything is very important 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:09.090
 in the kitchen the view helps us too 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:11.730
 of course know how it goes sauce 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:15.150
 times without trying it and still do not know what 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:17.760
 flavor will have and that's wonderful 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.069
 not from the kitchen also by the 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.230
 sound we can guide when it is 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.239
 bubbling too much oil we know 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.610
 which is very strong or when 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:29.040
 boiling a broth as you hear everything 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.200
 that's fascinating not from the kitchen 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:35.160
 so then you put it in very, very, very 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:38.190
 well since it 's important to leave at least 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.879
 about 7 minutes to reduce it and it 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.769
 concentren is ketchup 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:45.780
 delicious while that happens you 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:47.490
 you can make the pancakes 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.590
 that should distribute very well the 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:52.170
 activities in the kitchen so you do not 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.230
 Look tedious and do not be all morning 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.810
 there, although we like it a lot, I think that 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.720
 nobody likes all day put the 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:04.010
 cook then it better be 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:07.099
 practice the recipe 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:12.409
 how is this I am showing you here is 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:16.370
 potato tuna let's put cilantro and 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:19.549
 onion cambray let's season with 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:22.340
 a little salt and pepper the tuna and 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:26.420
 comes saladito but the potato if it requires 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:29.120
 of a little salt then with your hand 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.730
 let's start doing our 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.489
 pancakes if the egg is fixed is not 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.709
 in here we go as if I had more 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:39.709
 of a Milanese let's pass it by 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:41.780
 egg beaten and then for bread and so on 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:44.540
 it will look good golden and well 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:47.510
 Crunchy on the website 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.700
 I try on the facebook page natalia 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.709
 I try to mention that we are going to 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.470
 make our day here the next day 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:56.659
 and yesterday good dessert that we are going to do 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.060
 potato tortillas and all the questions 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:01.700
 they were very similar how I do it so that 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.359
 do not break me, look, I've 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:07.129
 found this technique very very 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:09.860
 appropriate is very simple and knows that 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:12.050
 also that they are not too big 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.820
 the same goes for hot cakes when 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:16.549
 it looks that it is very big and we want 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:18.140
 flip punch is cheap then 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:21.200
 look here there are no eggs no bread 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:23.740
 ground is simply the potato the tuna 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:27.530
 cilantro and onions a small size 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:31.550
 it will be very useful 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:34.490
 we're going to pass it through egg like this while 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:37.490
 I do the second one we're going to serve two 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:40.160
 person the truth that is a sweetie 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.740
 was saying our friend luÃ­s that 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:46.190
 it's your favorite because surely 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:49.190
 he remembers her childhood, not moms 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:52.730
 Grannies always in Lent do this 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:55.850
 stew my grandmother puts hot is to the 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:58.970
 tomato sauce and is very rich man 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:02.000
 It gives a texture to the sauce then we go 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:04.720
 to pass them by egg 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.380
 in this way 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:10.870
 we cover them with ground bread and if you have 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:14.280
 you in your cupboard bank put him bank 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:17.880
 you will see how wonderful the bank is the bread 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:20.970
 Japanese and it is extremely crunchy 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:24.340
 so then everything is cooked 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:27.160
 it's just a matter of it getting browned and 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:30.010
 it's going to last super soon you'll see the 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:33.670
 bread ground the fire should be 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:37.120
 medium high temperature not too much 

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:39.310
 strong because if you are not going to burn 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:43.960
 look let's put here of the oil a 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:46.110
 oil finger is more than enough 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:49.260
 I'm going to rinse your hands 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:51.960
 and lady do pancakes if you always 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:55.440
 has had problems that are disrupted 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:58.080
 that you burn that absorb too much 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:01.680
 oil is a good technique that you 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:05.040
 could use or know that directly from 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:09.810
 oven can take a tray and the steel 

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:11.760
 You put her pretty pancakes at 375 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:15.330
 degrees for approximately 10 minutes 

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:18.230
 to be golden and precious see 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:20.720
 nothing more than rich 

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:22.910
 so I have no problem when it comes to giving 

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:25.940
 the return because they are tiny but 

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:28.160
 they are chubby we can make them high already 

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:30.950
 that the potato is cooked tuna and everything 

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:33.860
 then of the ears also have 

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:35.990
 be careful that I will not keep it 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:38.300
 raw egg remember that we use egg 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:42.710
 then you can help him with a 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:45.350
 little bit the spatula like that and after that 

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:48.380
 7 minutes elapse sauce 

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:51.740
 tomato is this way to me 

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:54.980
 love see the density is cidh and 

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:58.070
 is a little bit spicy, nothing more 

00:06:54.980 --> 00:07:00.410
 everything was cooked here and in good sauce it 

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:02.610
