position cable for my 700r4 that was
rebuilt<00:03:52.480> 150,000<00:03:53.480> miles<00:03:53.629> ago<00:03:53.989> or<00:03:54.139> some<00:03:54.290> of

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 
rebuilt 150,000 miles ago or some of

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:57.670 
rebuilt 150,000 miles ago or some of
them<00:03:54.440> I<00:03:54.879> made<00:03:55.879> the<00:03:56.090> cable<00:03:56.510> longer<00:03:57.290> because<00:03:57.650> I

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
them I made the cable longer because I

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.220 
them I made the cable longer because I
had<00:03:57.859> previously<00:03:58.400> made<00:03:58.489> it<00:03:58.730> shorter<00:03:59.230> which

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
had previously made it shorter which

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:01.690 
had previously made it shorter which
made<00:04:00.439> the<00:04:00.530> transmission<00:04:01.069> shift<00:04:01.280> at<00:04:01.400> a<00:04:01.489> higher

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
made the transmission shift at a higher

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.440 
made the transmission shift at a higher
speed<00:04:02.319> but<00:04:03.319> to<00:04:03.590> high-speed<00:04:03.829> 4th<00:04:04.670> gear<00:04:04.879> at<00:04:05.000> 45

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
speed but to high-speed 4th gear at 45

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.030 
speed but to high-speed 4th gear at 45
miles<00:04:05.720> an<00:04:05.870> hour<00:04:05.989> with<00:04:06.230> light<00:04:06.409> throttle<00:04:06.650> so<00:04:06.950> i

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
miles an hour with light throttle so i

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.240 
miles an hour with light throttle so i
made<00:04:07.220> the<00:04:07.340> cable<00:04:07.670> longer<00:04:08.680> so<00:04:09.680> the<00:04:09.769> tranny<00:04:10.040> will

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
made the cable longer so the tranny will

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.240 
made the cable longer so the tranny will
shift<00:04:10.430> sooner<00:04:10.819> and<00:04:11.030> get<00:04:11.269> sluggish<00:04:11.750> but<00:04:12.650> tranny

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
shift sooner and get sluggish but tranny

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.659 
shift sooner and get sluggish but tranny
is<00:04:13.489> weak<00:04:13.760> in<00:04:14.000> this<00:04:14.450> better<00:04:15.160> there's<00:04:16.160> my<00:04:16.340> rust

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:16.669 
is weak in this better there's my rust

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:19.569 
is weak in this better there's my rust
proofing<00:04:17.030> grease<00:04:18.190> pretending<00:04:19.190> someone<00:04:19.459> that

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:19.579

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:21.370 
proofing grease pretending someone that
could<00:04:19.699> sell<00:04:19.849> me<00:04:19.970> a<00:04:20.000> rust<00:04:20.479> proofing<00:04:20.840> pump<00:04:21.169> and

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
could sell me a rust proofing pump and

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.920 
could sell me a rust proofing pump and
some<00:04:21.530> rust<00:04:21.739> proofing<00:04:22.070> grease<00:04:22.479> so<00:04:23.479> I<00:04:23.539> can<00:04:23.690> spray

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
some rust proofing grease so I can spray

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.330 
some rust proofing grease so I can spray
the<00:04:24.050> whole<00:04:24.169> vehicle<00:04:24.410> and<00:04:24.710> I<00:04:24.770> think

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340
