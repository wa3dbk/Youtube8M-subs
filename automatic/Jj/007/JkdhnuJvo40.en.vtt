get<00:01:24.330> a<00:01:24.360> sense<00:01:24.420> of<00:01:24.659> just<00:01:25.020> how<00:01:25.049> big<00:01:25.320> my<00:01:25.500> mech<00:01:25.680> is

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830

your shield you'll heal up and you can

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.690

kind of like determine whether or not

kind of like determine whether or not
you<00:02:31.590> would<00:02:31.680> win<00:02:31.890> would<00:02:32.519> be<00:02:32.640> good<00:02:32.849> management

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
you would win would be good management

of these three different states a lot of

of these three different states a lot of
people<00:02:34.769> kind<00:02:35.069> of<00:02:35.130> forgot<00:02:35.370> about<00:02:35.400> this<00:02:35.670> or

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
people kind of forgot about this or

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.520 
people kind of forgot about this or
maybe<00:02:36.510> thought<00:02:36.750> that<00:02:36.959> like<00:02:37.110> staying<00:02:37.410> and

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
maybe thought that like staying and

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:38.390 
maybe thought that like staying and
healing<00:02:37.800> would<00:02:37.950> just<00:02:38.099> keep<00:02:38.190> them<00:02:38.310> alive

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
healing would just keep them alive

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.920 
healing would just keep them alive
longer<00:02:38.790> but<00:02:39.090> really<00:02:39.390> if<00:02:39.540> you<00:02:39.630> can<00:02:39.750> kind<00:02:39.900> of

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
longer but really if you can kind of

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.180 
longer but really if you can kind of
actually<00:02:40.200> swap<00:02:40.410> between<00:02:40.500> like<00:02:40.860> speed<00:02:41.160> and

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
actually swap between like speed and

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.040 
actually swap between like speed and
obviously<00:02:41.700> swap<00:02:41.849> between<00:02:41.940> attack<00:02:42.360> you<00:02:42.840> can<00:02:42.959> do

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
obviously swap between attack you can do

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.540 
obviously swap between attack you can do
some<00:02:43.200> nasty<00:02:43.500> damage<00:02:43.530> and<00:02:43.920> get<00:02:44.130> around<00:02:44.190> really

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
some nasty damage and get around really

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.759 
some nasty damage and get around really
really<00:02:45.390> fast<00:02:45.600> I<00:02:45.840> probably<00:02:46.019> spent<00:02:46.350> most<00:02:46.590> of<00:02:46.709> my

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
really fast I probably spent most of my

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.199 
really fast I probably spent most of my
time<00:02:46.860> in<00:02:47.130> the<00:02:47.190> speed<00:02:47.400> class<00:02:47.610> just<00:02:48.150> because

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
time in the speed class just because

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.870 
time in the speed class just because
well<00:02:48.690> moving<00:02:49.230> fast<00:02:49.530> in<00:02:49.709> a<00:02:49.860> massive<00:02:50.010> mech<00:02:50.280> is<00:02:50.459> so

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
well moving fast in a massive mech is so

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.180 
well moving fast in a massive mech is so
so<00:02:51.390> much<00:02:51.630> fun<00:02:51.870> now<00:02:52.680> the<00:02:52.739> only<00:02:52.890> way<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.069> game

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
so much fun now the only way the game

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.440 
so much fun now the only way the game
itself<00:02:53.459> is<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:53.790> score<00:02:53.970> as<00:02:54.060> many<00:02:54.120> points<00:02:54.239> as

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
itself is the score as many points as

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.000 
itself is the score as many points as
possible<00:02:54.510> able<00:02:55.260> to<00:02:55.380> score<00:02:55.530> a<00:02:55.590> point<00:02:55.769> you<00:02:55.920> need

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
possible able to score a point you need

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.380 
possible able to score a point you need
to<00:02:56.069> get<00:02:56.280> into<00:02:56.370> overcharge<00:02:56.850> mode<00:02:57.060> and<00:02:57.239> then

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
to get into overcharge mode and then

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:58.490 
to get into overcharge mode and then
jump<00:02:57.660> through<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:57.870> Ring<00:02:57.989> in<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.230> middle<00:02:58.470> of

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
jump through the Ring in the middle of

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.900 
jump through the Ring in the middle of
the<00:02:58.560> level<00:02:58.860> now<00:02:59.340> you<00:02:59.400> went<00:02:59.580> to<00:02:59.640> overcharge

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
the level now you went to overcharge

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.910 
the level now you went to overcharge
mode<00:03:00.180> either<00:03:00.360> by<00:03:00.840> killing<00:03:01.200> three<00:03:01.470> opponents

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
mode either by killing three opponents

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:02.720 
mode either by killing three opponents
at<00:03:02.040> which<00:03:02.190> point<00:03:02.340> you'll<00:03:02.519> intro

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
at which point you'll intro

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.789 
at which point you'll intro
automatically<00:03:03.299> or<00:03:03.480> by<00:03:04.110> collecting<00:03:04.500> the<00:03:04.560> orbs

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
automatically or by collecting the orbs

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:06.140 
automatically or by collecting the orbs
that<00:03:04.860> you<00:03:05.010> see<00:03:05.190> either<00:03:05.310> around<00:03:05.640> the<00:03:05.700> level<00:03:06.000> or

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
that you see either around the level or

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.699 
that you see either around the level or
that<00:03:06.510> were<00:03:06.599> also<00:03:06.810> dropped<00:03:07.049> when<00:03:07.319> you<00:03:07.440> kill<00:03:07.620> an

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
that were also dropped when you kill an

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.530 
that were also dropped when you kill an
opponent<00:03:07.819> when<00:03:08.819> you<00:03:08.910> begin<00:03:09.030> glowing<00:03:09.269> yellow

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
opponent when you begin glowing yellow

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.059 
opponent when you begin glowing yellow
it's<00:03:09.810> at<00:03:10.049> this<00:03:10.140> point<00:03:10.290> you<00:03:10.440> can<00:03:10.530> jump<00:03:10.709> in<00:03:10.860> and

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
it's at this point you can jump in and

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:12.979 
it's at this point you can jump in and
even<00:03:11.280> score<00:03:11.549> obviously<00:03:12.360> the<00:03:12.420> enemy<00:03:12.630> team<00:03:12.780> can

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
even score obviously the enemy team can

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:14.210 
even score obviously the enemy team can
stop<00:03:13.230> you<00:03:13.410> that<00:03:13.590> can<00:03:13.680> either<00:03:13.769> shoot<00:03:14.010> you

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
stop you that can either shoot you

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.490 
stop you that can either shoot you
alternatively<00:03:15.209> on<00:03:15.480> our<00:03:15.720> three<00:03:15.959> you<00:03:16.080> also<00:03:16.349> have

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
alternatively on our three you also have

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:17.960 
alternatively on our three you also have
Mellie<00:03:16.709> so<00:03:17.130> we<00:03:17.220> can<00:03:17.370> do<00:03:17.489> is<00:03:17.609> you<00:03:17.700> can<00:03:17.730> jump

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
Mellie so we can do is you can jump

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.069 
Mellie so we can do is you can jump
towards<00:03:18.239> someone<00:03:18.390> as<00:03:18.630> they're<00:03:18.780> about<00:03:18.840> to<00:03:18.989> go

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
towards someone as they're about to go

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:20.509 
towards someone as they're about to go
in<00:03:19.170> the<00:03:19.230> gold<00:03:19.440> press<00:03:19.920> Mellie<00:03:20.130> and<00:03:20.370> you<00:03:20.430> can

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
in the gold press Mellie and you can

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:21.949 
in the gold press Mellie and you can
kind<00:03:20.609> of<00:03:20.700> punch<00:03:20.880> them<00:03:21.030> out<00:03:21.120> which<00:03:21.390> is<00:03:21.420> pretty

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
kind of punch them out which is pretty

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.330 
kind of punch them out which is pretty
awesome<00:03:22.200> that<00:03:22.500> actually<00:03:22.799> happens<00:03:23.040> to<00:03:23.130> me<00:03:23.220> in

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
awesome that actually happens to me in

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.750 
awesome that actually happens to me in
this<00:03:23.430> gameplay<00:03:23.640> so<00:03:24.030> yeah<00:03:25.280> anyway<00:03:26.280> aside<00:03:26.700> from

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
this gameplay so yeah anyway aside from

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.490 
this gameplay so yeah anyway aside from
that<00:03:26.850> just<00:03:27.660> like<00:03:27.810> with<00:03:27.900> the<00:03:27.989> diamond<00:03:28.200> heist<00:03:28.380> I

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
that just like with the diamond heist I

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:29.930 
that just like with the diamond heist I
was<00:03:28.620> actually<00:03:28.709> amazed<00:03:29.040> how<00:03:29.370> quickly<00:03:29.430> i<00:03:29.819> was

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
was actually amazed how quickly i was

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:30.890 
was actually amazed how quickly i was
able<00:03:30.090> to<00:03:30.180> pick<00:03:30.269> up<00:03:30.359> the<00:03:30.420> controls<00:03:30.720> in<00:03:30.810> this

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
able to pick up the controls in this

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.449 
able to pick up the controls in this
game<00:03:31.079> this<00:03:31.650> one<00:03:31.859> took<00:03:31.980> a<00:03:32.069> little<00:03:32.100> bit<00:03:32.340> longer

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
game this one took a little bit longer

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:33.500 
game this one took a little bit longer
because<00:03:32.670> they<00:03:32.850> were<00:03:32.940> sort<00:03:33.000> of<00:03:33.090> like<00:03:33.209> a<00:03:33.239> few

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
because they were sort of like a few

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:34.610 
because they were sort of like a few
more<00:03:33.630> mechanics<00:03:33.989> to<00:03:34.079> actually<00:03:34.290> take<00:03:34.410> into

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
more mechanics to actually take into

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:35.690 
more mechanics to actually take into
account<00:03:34.799> like<00:03:35.069> it<00:03:35.190> took<00:03:35.340> me<00:03:35.459> a<00:03:35.489> little<00:03:35.579> while

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
account like it took me a little while

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.370 
account like it took me a little while
to<00:03:36.030> click<00:03:36.600> with<00:03:36.780> the<00:03:36.870> whole<00:03:36.959> three<00:03:37.140> different

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
to click with the whole three different

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.500 
to click with the whole three different
most<00:03:37.560> things<00:03:37.799> but<00:03:38.310> still<00:03:38.760> regardless<00:03:39.209> the

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
most things but still regardless the

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:40.670 
most things but still regardless the
second<00:03:39.720> you<00:03:39.780> put<00:03:39.870> on<00:03:39.959> the<00:03:40.019> headset<00:03:40.170> as<00:03:40.470> I<00:03:40.530> can

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
second you put on the headset as I can

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.809 
second you put on the headset as I can
you<00:03:40.709> jump<00:03:40.920> in<00:03:41.040> the<00:03:41.100> world<00:03:41.280> you<00:03:41.400> start<00:03:41.609> moving

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 
you jump in the world you start moving

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:43.250 
you jump in the world you start moving
around<00:03:41.910> it<00:03:42.450> all<00:03:42.630> starts<00:03:42.930> to<00:03:43.019> make<00:03:43.049> sense

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
around it all starts to make sense

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.660 
around it all starts to make sense
straight<00:03:43.709> away<00:03:43.950> which<00:03:44.130> is<00:03:44.190> just<00:03:44.519> what's

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
straight away which is just what's

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.099 
straight away which is just what's
really<00:03:45.030> good<00:03:45.180> about<00:03:45.209> these<00:03:45.480> video<00:03:45.690> games<00:03:45.720> you

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109 
really good about these video games you

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:46.940 
really good about these video games you
know<00:03:46.200> you<00:03:46.260> think<00:03:46.560> there<00:03:46.680> will<00:03:46.739> be<00:03:46.799> like<00:03:46.920> a

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
know you think there will be like a

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.500 
know you think there will be like a
steep<00:03:47.190> learning<00:03:47.220> curve<00:03:47.549> what<00:03:47.910> feel<00:03:48.150> weird<00:03:48.389> at

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
steep learning curve what feel weird at

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.539 
steep learning curve what feel weird at
first<00:03:48.540> but<00:03:48.870> strangely<00:03:49.769> like<00:03:49.980> the<00:03:50.100> second<00:03:50.340> up

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
first but strangely like the second up

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:52.160 
first but strangely like the second up
to<00:03:50.639> the<00:03:50.730> sea<00:03:50.880> tour<00:03:50.940> just<00:03:51.150> like<00:03:51.239> this<00:03:51.870> feels

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
to the sea tour just like this feels
