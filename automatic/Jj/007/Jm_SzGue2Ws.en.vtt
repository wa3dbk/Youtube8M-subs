00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
two days really just 20 or 30 tanks and

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.570 
two days really just 20 or 30 tanks and
really<00:04:07.090> great<00:04:07.350> batteries<00:04:08.350> of<00:04:08.470> course<00:04:08.830> they

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580 
really great batteries of course they

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:14.750 
really great batteries of course they
will<00:04:09.790> improve<00:04:11.280> your<00:04:12.390> servos<00:04:13.390> the<00:04:13.720> speed<00:04:14.019> and

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
will improve your servos the speed and

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.170 
will improve your servos the speed and
the<00:04:15.870> strong<00:04:16.870> the<00:04:17.260> strong

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
the strong the strong

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.940 
the strong the strong
the<00:04:20.180> stronger<00:04:20.570> they<00:04:20.690> get<00:04:20.870> widows<00:04:21.440> batteries

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
the stronger they get widows batteries

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.610 
the stronger they get widows batteries
so<00:04:22.070> can<00:04:22.250> really<00:04:22.460> recommend<00:04:23.140> watch<00:04:24.140> that<00:04:24.440> your

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
so can really recommend watch that your

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.470 
so can really recommend watch that your
servers<00:04:25.070> are<00:04:25.100> definitely<00:04:25.760> for<00:04:26.030> high<00:04:26.270> voltage

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
servers are definitely for high voltage

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.580 
servers are definitely for high voltage
so<00:04:26.960> 7.4<00:04:28.540> another<00:04:29.540> reason<00:04:29.960> you<00:04:30.080> can<00:04:30.260> go<00:04:30.410> with

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
so 7.4 another reason you can go with

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.160 
so 7.4 another reason you can go with
those<00:04:30.770> little<00:04:31.130> things<00:04:31.280> they<00:04:31.550> will<00:04:31.780> get<00:04:32.780> much

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:33.170 
those little things they will get much

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.860 
those little things they will get much
more<00:04:33.200> lower<00:04:33.680> and<00:04:34.240> take<00:04:35.240> everything<00:04:35.570> out<00:04:35.810> of

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
more lower and take everything out of

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.960 
more lower and take everything out of
your<00:04:36.080> servos<00:04:36.560> and<00:04:36.830> I'm<00:04:37.520> gonna<00:04:37.640> come<00:04:37.850> in<00:04:37.910> with

you have here

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.770 
you have here
you<00:04:47.690> got<00:04:48.010> battery<00:04:49.010> coming<00:04:49.460> in<00:04:49.580> the<00:04:49.970> front<00:04:50.210> so

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
you got battery coming in the front so

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.330 
you got battery coming in the front so
you<00:04:50.870> see<00:04:51.080> it's<00:04:51.260> really<00:04:51.440> not<00:04:51.620> a<00:04:51.680> lot<00:04:51.950> of<00:04:52.070> space

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
you see it's really not a lot of space

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.480 
you see it's really not a lot of space
so<00:04:52.720> that's<00:04:53.720> why<00:04:53.930> I<00:04:53.960> know<00:04:54.080> I<00:04:54.230> take<00:04:54.950> that<00:04:55.010> back<00:04:55.370> to

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
so that's why I know I take that back to
