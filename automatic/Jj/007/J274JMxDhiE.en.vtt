 the mouth of the river lielupe local old-timers already 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.730
 baptized with water bermuda triangle 

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:07.680
 ships come 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.760
 but no one comes back at least 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.010
 least without help 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.920
 today two yachts are trapped and 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.949
 motor yachts someone rushed 1 meter 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.029
 eighty sediment him the same problems he 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:23.460
 catches the bottom have to walk across the river 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:24.539
 help and here look empty worth it nobody 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.279
 don't even ride 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.050
 if a few years ago here 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.240
 Regattas were held at the port 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.160
 foreign ships came Russian 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.710
 yachts to relax view room now 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.870
 this source of income of the resort is still covered 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.980
 on the memory and flight of meteors tartu Tallinn 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.020
 and saint petersburg 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.300
 here ashore as a memory of those longtime 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.370
 times there is such a shipping 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.300
 a sign that is still confusing 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.640
 water tourists 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.250
 local deputies personally decided 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.780
 demonstrate the depth of the problem in 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.120
 first to establish the battle which is now 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.579
 do not stand and pressing them around the clock 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.190
 light bulbs to any visiting 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.609
 Finn or someone else from friendly 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.770
 countries 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.570
 Asya on the yacht among other things 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.729
 existing mark and navigation 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.920
 the card broke my mast 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.280
 main head and then not sent a claim 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.590
 damages must be assumed from 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.869
 many hundred thousand frets or dollars or 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.479
 euro because the navigation here is dangerous 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.549
 for life the local boat owners at 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.340
 low tide set on the water itself blow on 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.890
 ebu and bind bottles and lowers on 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.049
 water so as not to run aground more difficult 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.270
 yacht owners high masts 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.400
 to choose another way they need 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.220
 go under the bridge which will not allow to do 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.200
 mast height then you need to call the crane 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.500
 shoot mast call again 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.320
 go in debt look for a crane puts up a mast 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.460
 all this is in general how to tell me 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.229
 interesting but as a result of people then 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.579
 new shifts will say so lost 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.399
 interest in our harbor 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.560
 waters runs local vessels there and 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.579
 back by the river whether a magnifying glass is like a swimmer 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.590
 small size pool 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.329
 so why the question is why because 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.939
 a ridiculous amount to deepen 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.280
 fairway the resort city decided huge 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.890
 profits and loses its prestige of maritime 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.410
 the port after all every year in Jurmala and at home 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.660
 allocates money for such work in 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.420
 This year the competition was won by a certain company. 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.910
 under the name 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.280
 him euro 2000 but receiving a deposit 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.020
 half of the amount of customers this company 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.180
 disappeared not her 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:25.950
 and in the business register is not responding and 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:30.640
 the phone changed every year the company and 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:32.730
 every year we received a result of zero then 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:37.030
 there are even money transferred a 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:39.730
 the result was not even possible to blame 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:43.300
 firms that firms changed people changed 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.310
 perhaps the fault of the port authority itself 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.230
 where do the deputyâ€™s money go? 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.140
 Jurmala Duma promises to understand 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.510
 soon but today it is clear that in 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.540
 this season the port of Leps will remain 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.549
 trap and not following X-Men Irina 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.880
