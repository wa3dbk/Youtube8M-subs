00:00:48.919 --> 00:00:48.929 
so that we really like to automate it

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:50.419 
so that we really like to automate it
isn't<00:00:49.289> very<00:00:49.319> expensive<00:00:49.979> to<00:00:50.069> automate<00:00:50.399> a

cylinder here in the middle has a wax
that<00:01:12.350> melts<00:01:13.350> at<00:01:13.530> about<00:01:13.910> 55<00:01:14.910> degrees<00:01:14.940> and<00:01:15.630> as<00:01:16.290> it

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
that melts at about 55 degrees and as it

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.790 
that melts at about 55 degrees and as it
melts<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:17.070> expands<00:01:17.940> as<00:01:18.350> expands<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.470> drives

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:19.800 
melts it expands as expands it drives

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.350 
melts it expands as expands it drives
this<00:01:20.570> open<00:01:21.570> as<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:22.680> cools<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.310> contracts<00:01:24.090> and

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
this open as it cools it contracts and

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.920 
this open as it cools it contracts and
allows<00:01:24.690> the<00:01:24.960> springs<00:01:25.410> to<00:01:25.680> pull<00:01:26.250> this<00:01:26.430> down<00:01:27.150> so

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
allows the springs to pull this down so

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.730 
allows the springs to pull this down so
it's<00:01:28.140> it's<00:01:28.920> pretty<00:01:29.570> pretty<00:01:30.570> stiff<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.410> idea

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
it's it's pretty pretty stiff the idea

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.580 
it's it's pretty pretty stiff the idea
of<00:01:31.920> these<00:01:32.100> three<00:01:32.550> Springs<00:01:32.970> is<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.480> hold<00:01:34.110> on<00:01:34.410> to

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
of these three Springs is to hold on to

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:35.990 
of these three Springs is to hold on to
the<00:01:34.710> vent<00:01:34.920> so<00:01:35.100> when<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.340> wind<00:01:35.520> blows<00:01:35.730> it

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
the vent so when the wind blows it

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.050 
the vent so when the wind blows it
doesn't<00:01:36.270> rip<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.570> vent<00:01:36.780> open<00:01:37.080> so<00:01:37.590> it's<00:01:38.060> you

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
doesn't rip the vent open so it's you

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.380 
doesn't rip the vent open so it's you
can<00:01:39.440> feel<00:01:40.440> how<00:01:40.680> much<00:01:41.010> tension<00:01:41.910> there<00:01:42.060> is<00:01:42.210> in

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
can feel how much tension there is in

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.670 
can feel how much tension there is in
that<00:01:43.100> yeah<00:01:44.100> there's<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.150> there's<00:01:45.480> a<00:01:45.780> just<00:01:46.470> about

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
that yeah there's a there's a just about

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.130 
that yeah there's a there's a just about
here<00:01:47.280> too<00:01:47.550> so<00:01:47.850> you<00:01:47.940> can<00:01:47.970> adjust<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.630> starting

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
here too so you can adjust the starting

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.050 
here too so you can adjust the starting
temperature<00:01:49.380> of<00:01:49.830> the<00:01:49.920> unit<00:01:50.280> if<00:01:50.730> you<00:01:50.820> want<00:01:50.970> to

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
temperature of the unit if you want to

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.740 
temperature of the unit if you want to
check<00:01:51.180> it<00:01:51.330> out

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
check it out

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.140 
check it out
okay<00:01:52.620> so<00:01:53.430> there's<00:01:53.720> several<00:01:54.720> versions<00:01:55.020> of<00:01:55.440> this

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.150 
okay so there's several versions of this

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.500 
okay so there's several versions of this
or<00:01:57.150> do<00:01:57.420> we<00:01:57.540> there's<00:01:58.290> also<00:01:58.880> that<00:01:59.880> particular

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:00.510 
or do we there's also that particular

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.620 
or do we there's also that particular
that<00:02:00.780> particular<00:02:00.960> units<00:02:01.680> made<00:02:01.890> in<00:02:02.070> England

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
that particular units made in England

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.679 
that particular units made in England
this<00:02:03.630> unit<00:02:03.990> is<00:02:04.110> made<00:02:04.229> in<00:02:04.409> Denmark

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:18.180 

similar<00:02:12.540> and<00:02:13.540> here's<00:02:13.810> the<00:02:14.280> power<00:02:15.280> tube<00:02:17.190> so

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
similar and here's the power tube so

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.979 
similar and here's the power tube so
that's<00:02:18.489> again<00:02:19.239> a<00:02:19.299> mineralized<00:02:19.780> wax<00:02:21.930> so<00:02:22.930> you

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
that's again a mineralized wax so you

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:24.869 
that's again a mineralized wax so you
attach<00:02:23.140> attach<00:02:23.769> this<00:02:24.250> to<00:02:24.310> your<00:02:24.640> greenhouse

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 
attach attach this to your greenhouse

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:27.750 
attach attach this to your greenhouse
vent<00:02:25.450> you<00:02:26.290> can<00:02:26.440> actually<00:02:26.650> use<00:02:27.129> these<00:02:27.340> on<00:02:27.489> cold

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
vent you can actually use these on cold

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.820 
vent you can actually use these on cold
frames<00:02:28.060> because<00:02:28.330> it<00:02:28.629> will<00:02:28.750> detach<00:02:29.140> very

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
frames because it will detach very

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:38.070 
frames because it will detach very
easily<00:02:30.870> and<00:02:32.849> I<00:02:34.049> set<00:02:35.049> the<00:02:35.200> power<00:02:35.379> tube<00:02:37.080> through

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
easily and I set the power tube through

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.339 
easily and I set the power tube through
the<00:02:38.230> threaded<00:02:38.500> adjustment<00:02:39.190> here<00:02:40.200> and<00:02:41.200> when

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
the threaded adjustment here and when

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:43.619 
the threaded adjustment here and when
you<00:02:41.440> get<00:02:41.530> this<00:02:41.680> all<00:02:41.860> hooked<00:02:42.129> up<00:02:42.299> you've<00:02:43.299> got<00:02:43.480> an

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:43.629 
you get this all hooked up you've got an

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:46.530 
you get this all hooked up you've got an
automatic<00:02:43.870> device<00:02:44.290> again<00:02:44.650> it's<00:02:44.860> this<00:02:45.540> twist

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
automatic device again it's this twist

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.809 
automatic device again it's this twist
to<00:02:46.810> adjust<00:02:47.230> the<00:02:47.379> temperature<00:02:47.829> setting<00:02:48.099> so<00:02:48.730> you

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
to adjust the temperature setting so you

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:52.350 
to adjust the temperature setting so you
can<00:02:49.140> set<00:02:50.140> when<00:02:50.470> it<00:02:50.500> starts<00:02:51.040> and<00:02:51.360> usually

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
can set when it starts and usually

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.479 
can set when it starts and usually
they're<00:02:52.569> open<00:02:52.930> after<00:02:53.140> about<00:02:53.440> 15<00:02:53.890> 20<00:02:54.069> degree

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
they're open after about 15 20 degree

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.009 
they're open after about 15 20 degree
temperature<00:02:54.910> riser<00:02:55.120> wide<00:02:55.480> open

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
temperature riser wide open

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:57.990 
temperature riser wide open
the<00:02:56.349> nice<00:02:56.530> thing<00:02:56.560> is<00:02:56.860> that<00:02:57.010> they<00:02:57.310> gradually

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
the nice thing is that they gradually

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.360 
the nice thing is that they gradually
open<00:02:58.299> and<00:02:58.480> gradually<00:02:59.019> close<00:02:59.319> so<00:02:59.620> they<00:02:59.739> really

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
open and gradually close so they really

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.360 
open and gradually close so they really
monitor<00:03:00.849> the<00:03:01.000> temperature<00:03:02.010> thermally<00:03:03.010> in<00:03:03.280> the

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
monitor the temperature thermally in the

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.750 
monitor the temperature thermally in the
piston<00:03:03.760> here<00:03:03.910> so<00:03:04.870> that's<00:03:05.140> the<00:03:05.590> new<00:03:06.579> way<00:03:06.730> of

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
piston here so that's the new way of

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.059 
piston here so that's the new way of
controlling<00:03:07.239> the<00:03:07.390> events<00:03:08.140> that<00:03:08.590> you<00:03:08.620> saw<00:03:09.010> the

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
controlling the events that you saw the

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:11.309 
controlling the events that you saw the
roof<00:03:09.370> fence<00:03:09.579> in<00:03:09.790> the<00:03:09.849> greenhouses<00:03:10.269> and<00:03:10.660> that's

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 
roof fence in the greenhouses and that's

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:12.960 
roof fence in the greenhouses and that's
the<00:03:11.470> way<00:03:11.590> to<00:03:11.650> control<00:03:12.040> those<00:03:12.190> in<00:03:12.430> and<00:03:12.609> again<00:03:12.819> in

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
the way to control those in and again in

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.180 
the way to control those in and again in
a<00:03:13.030> cold<00:03:13.269> frame<00:03:13.540> you<00:03:14.200> can<00:03:14.349> put<00:03:14.560> this<00:03:14.709> on<00:03:14.950> the

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
a cold frame you can put this on the

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.030 
a cold frame you can put this on the
cold<00:03:15.370> frame<00:03:15.639> lid<00:03:16.359> to<00:03:16.930> lift<00:03:17.440> the<00:03:17.590> cold<00:03:17.799> frame

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
cold frame lid to lift the cold frame

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.220 
cold frame lid to lift the cold frame
lid<00:03:18.250> and<00:03:18.400> let<00:03:18.519> it<00:03:18.579> vent<00:03:18.880> so<00:03:19.750> you<00:03:19.840> don't<00:03:20.019> have<00:03:20.109> to

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
lid and let it vent so you don't have to

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:26.470 
lid and let it vent so you don't have to
do<00:03:20.349> it<00:03:20.470> manually

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.000 

as<00:03:27.480> you<00:03:27.659> thread<00:03:27.959> those<00:03:28.140> in<00:03:28.409> the<00:03:28.590> farther<00:03:28.920> you

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
as you thread those in the farther you

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.089 
as you thread those in the farther you
thread<00:03:29.489> the<00:03:29.670> adjustment<00:03:30.299> in<00:03:30.420> the<00:03:31.170> sooner<00:03:31.980> it

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:32.099 
thread the adjustment in the sooner it

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:34.819 
thread the adjustment in the sooner it
will<00:03:32.370> start<00:03:32.670> to<00:03:32.790> open<00:03:32.819> they<00:03:33.810> all<00:03:34.019> vary<00:03:34.379> just<00:03:34.709> a

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
will start to open they all vary just a

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:38.240 
will start to open they all vary just a
little<00:03:35.099> bit<00:03:35.280> so<00:03:36.060> you'll<00:03:36.329> have<00:03:36.480> to<00:03:37.010> adjust<00:03:38.010> them

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
little bit so you'll have to adjust them

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.780 
little bit so you'll have to adjust them
a<00:03:38.430> little<00:03:39.000> bit<00:03:39.120> so<00:03:40.110> when<00:03:40.500> we<00:03:40.650> have<00:03:41.430> a<00:03:41.459> smaller

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
a little bit so when we have a smaller

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.610 
a little bit so when we have a smaller
greenhouse<00:03:42.180> they<00:03:42.360> work<00:03:42.540> great<00:03:42.750> but<00:03:43.349> if<00:03:43.530> you

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
greenhouse they work great but if you

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.589 
greenhouse they work great but if you
get<00:03:43.769> into<00:03:44.010> a<00:03:44.040> 12<00:03:44.340> by<00:03:44.489> 16<00:03:44.790> greenhouse<00:03:45.359> and

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
get into a 12 by 16 greenhouse and

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:48.830 
get into a 12 by 16 greenhouse and
you've<00:03:45.720> got<00:03:45.900> six<00:03:46.170> roof<00:03:46.439> vents<00:03:47.000> and<00:03:48.000> you<00:03:48.629> want

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
you've got six roof vents and you want

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.929 
you've got six roof vents and you want
to<00:03:49.019> you<00:03:49.230> decide<00:03:49.560> they're<00:03:50.280> opening<00:03:50.640> up<00:03:50.730> too

00:03:50.929 --> 00:03:50.939 
to you decide they're opening up too

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:52.160 
to you decide they're opening up too
soon<00:03:51.150> well<00:03:51.390> you<00:03:51.420> got<00:03:51.599> to<00:03:51.689> give<00:03:51.780> you<00:03:51.840> up<00:03:51.930> on<00:03:52.079> the

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
soon well you got to give you up on the

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.259 
soon well you got to give you up on the
ladder<00:03:52.409> and<00:03:52.680> adjust<00:03:53.280> all<00:03:53.430> six<00:03:53.730> of<00:03:53.849> those

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
ladder and adjust all six of those

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:56.240 
ladder and adjust all six of those
well<00:03:54.930> we<00:03:55.319> think<00:03:55.530> maybe<00:03:55.709> it's<00:03:55.920> a<00:03:55.950> better<00:03:56.069> idea

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
well we think maybe it's a better idea

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.550 
well we think maybe it's a better idea
to<00:03:56.430> put<00:03:56.670> a<00:03:56.700> fan<00:03:57.060> system<00:03:57.420> in<00:03:57.810> that<00:03:58.079> type<00:03:58.319> of<00:03:58.349> a

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
to put a fan system in that type of a

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.640 
to put a fan system in that type of a
greenhouse<00:03:58.920> with<00:03:59.730> a<00:03:59.790> single<00:04:00.180> thermostat<00:04:00.750> so

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
greenhouse with a single thermostat so

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.509 
greenhouse with a single thermostat so
here's<00:04:02.040> your<00:04:02.780> here's<00:04:03.780> your<00:04:04.019> thermostat<00:04:04.590> that

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
here's your here's your thermostat that

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:08.420 
here's your here's your thermostat that
would<00:04:05.670> control<00:04:06.000> a<00:04:06.030> fan<00:04:06.359> system<00:04:06.629> just<00:04:07.440> adjust

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
would control a fan system just adjust

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:09.740 
would control a fan system just adjust
the<00:04:08.549> dial<00:04:08.760> to<00:04:08.940> whatever<00:04:09.120> temperature<00:04:09.450> you

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
the dial to whatever temperature you

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.199 
the dial to whatever temperature you
want<00:04:10.109> in<00:04:10.290> the<00:04:10.470> greenhouse<00:04:10.849> this<00:04:11.849> use<00:04:12.120> your

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
want in the greenhouse this use your

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.740 
want in the greenhouse this use your
sensing<00:04:12.900> coil<00:04:13.200> and<00:04:13.470> that<00:04:14.010> will<00:04:14.480> very<00:04:15.480> quickly

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
sensing coil and that will very quickly

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.810 
sensing coil and that will very quickly
send<00:04:16.350> the<00:04:16.440> temperature<00:04:16.919> into<00:04:17.489> the<00:04:17.579> switch

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
send the temperature into the switch

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.960 
send the temperature into the switch
here<00:04:18.060> and<00:04:18.180> turn<00:04:18.299> your<00:04:18.449> fan<00:04:18.660> on<00:04:18.900> or<00:04:19.079> off<00:04:19.970> exhaust

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
here and turn your fan on or off exhaust

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.960 
here and turn your fan on or off exhaust
fans<00:04:21.269> are<00:04:21.570> shutter<00:04:22.470> mounted<00:04:22.889> so<00:04:23.430> that<00:04:23.460> when

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
fans are shutter mounted so that when

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.390 
fans are shutter mounted so that when
they're<00:04:24.150> off<00:04:24.360> the<00:04:24.840> shutter<00:04:25.080> closes<00:04:25.320> and<00:04:25.860> keeps

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
they're off the shutter closes and keeps

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.400 
they're off the shutter closes and keeps
the<00:04:26.580> warm<00:04:26.789> air<00:04:26.970> in<00:04:27.090> the<00:04:27.150> greenhouse<00:04:27.509> and<00:04:27.810> then

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
the warm air in the greenhouse and then

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.230 
the warm air in the greenhouse and then
when<00:04:28.590> the<00:04:28.710> fan<00:04:29.070> comes<00:04:29.310> on<00:04:29.460> it<00:04:29.639> just<00:04:29.789> blows<00:04:30.030> the

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
when the fan comes on it just blows the

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.439 
when the fan comes on it just blows the
shutter<00:04:30.449> open<00:04:30.870> so<00:04:31.740> this<00:04:32.010> is<00:04:32.220> a<00:04:32.449> waterproof

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:33.449 
shutter open so this is a waterproof

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:35.659 
shutter open so this is a waterproof
unit<00:04:34.349> so<00:04:34.770> you<00:04:34.800> know<00:04:35.099> I<00:04:35.130> have<00:04:35.310> to<00:04:35.400> worry<00:04:35.550> about

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:35.669 
unit so you know I have to worry about

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:38.510 
unit so you know I have to worry about
hosing<00:04:36.060> it<00:04:36.150> down<00:04:36.210> it<00:04:36.990> comes<00:04:37.289> either<00:04:37.680> pre-wired

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
hosing it down it comes either pre-wired

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.490 
hosing it down it comes either pre-wired
like<00:04:38.760> this<00:04:39.030> where<00:04:39.960> you<00:04:40.020> can<00:04:40.139> just<00:04:40.289> plug<00:04:40.470> your

like this where you can just plug your
fan<00:04:40.830> into<00:04:41.190> it<00:04:41.310> or<00:04:41.599> you<00:04:42.599> can<00:04:42.720> switch<00:04:42.930> the<00:04:43.229> wires

00:04:43.399 --> 00:04:43.409 
fan into it or you can switch the wires

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:45.620 
fan into it or you can switch the wires
in<00:04:43.710> here<00:04:43.949> and<00:04:44.190> use<00:04:44.430> this<00:04:44.580> to<00:04:44.789> run<00:04:44.940> an

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
in here and use this to run an

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.040 
in here and use this to run an
inexpensive<00:04:46.199> heater<00:04:47.479> we'll<00:04:48.479> talk<00:04:48.659> about<00:04:48.780> that

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
inexpensive heater we'll talk about that

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.520 
inexpensive heater we'll talk about that
later

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
later

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.980 
later
but<00:04:50.010> anyway<00:04:50.580> this<00:04:50.729> is<00:04:50.909> called<00:04:51.150> a<00:04:51.270> series<00:04:51.630> plug

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
but anyway this is called a series plug

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.070 
but anyway this is called a series plug
and<00:04:52.260> the<00:04:52.889> power<00:04:53.150> goes<00:04:54.150> directly<00:04:54.570> through<00:04:54.690> one

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
and the power goes directly through one

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.350 
and the power goes directly through one
side<00:04:55.349> the<00:04:56.280> other<00:04:56.460> side<00:04:56.729> goes<00:04:56.940> through<00:04:57.210> the

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
side the other side goes through the

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.629 
side the other side goes through the
thermostat<00:04:57.900> so<00:04:58.080> requires<00:04:58.650> the<00:04:59.010> thermostat<00:04:59.520> to

00:04:59.629 --> 00:04:59.639 
thermostat so requires the thermostat to

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:05.120 
thermostat so requires the thermostat to
close<00:04:59.820> the<00:05:00.030> circuit<00:05:02.960> now<00:05:03.960> for<00:05:04.260> we<00:05:04.889> talked

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
close the circuit now for we talked

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.820 
close the circuit now for we talked
about<00:05:05.220> the<00:05:05.460> fan<00:05:05.720> taking<00:05:06.720> the<00:05:06.840> warm<00:05:07.440> air<00:05:07.620> out<00:05:07.740> of

the fresh air to come in and replace it

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.129 
the fresh air to come in and replace it
if<00:05:12.060> you<00:05:12.180> don't<00:05:12.360> want<00:05:12.539> to<00:05:12.599> go<00:05:12.750> open<00:05:13.020> the<00:05:13.110> door

the fresh air to come in now these this

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.010 
the fresh air to come in now these this
is<00:05:22.680> the<00:05:22.830> outside<00:05:23.250> of<00:05:23.400> the<00:05:23.460> shutter<00:05:23.699> and<00:05:24.630> we<00:05:24.810> put

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
is the outside of the shutter and we put

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:30.080 
is the outside of the shutter and we put
a<00:05:25.050> motor<00:05:25.349> on<00:05:25.970> the<00:05:26.970> inside<00:05:28.010> that<00:05:29.010> will<00:05:29.220> attach

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:34.469 
thermostat calls for it it pulls down on

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:37.909 
thermostat calls for it it pulls down on
the<00:05:34.680> tie<00:05:34.889> rod<00:05:35.159> and<00:05:35.750> opens<00:05:36.750> the<00:05:36.870> shutter<00:05:37.139> so<00:05:37.770> the

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:37.919 
the tie rod and opens the shutter so the

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:39.950 
the tie rod and opens the shutter so the
fresh<00:05:38.130> air<00:05:38.340> can<00:05:38.520> come<00:05:38.700> in<00:05:38.849> in<00:05:38.940> the<00:05:39.000> greenhouse

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
fresh air can come in in the greenhouse

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.170

from<00:05:47.610> the<00:05:47.729> fan<00:05:48.000> so<00:05:48.750> you<00:05:48.840> can<00:05:49.110> draw<00:05:49.320> the<00:05:49.350> air<00:05:49.620> all

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:49.770 
from the fan so you can draw the air all

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:56.270 
the way through the greenhouse now we've
got<00:05:52.740> the<00:05:53.039> the<00:05:53.370> formulas<00:05:53.850> for<00:05:53.880> how<00:05:54.919> big<00:05:55.919> a<00:05:55.949> fan

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:42.830 
change the air in the greenhouse
theoretically<00:06:40.800> in<00:06:40.919> about<00:06:41.130> 2<00:06:41.370> 2<00:06:42.210> minutes<00:06:42.539> or<00:06:42.630> so

and that's fast enough if you want it if

00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:47.930 
and that's fast enough if you want it if
you<00:06:45.960> change<00:06:46.229> the<00:06:46.440> air<00:06:46.560> in<00:06:46.710> a<00:06:46.800> minute<00:06:46.830> like<00:06:47.340> the
