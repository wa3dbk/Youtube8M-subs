00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:51.090 
we build and actually I really enjoyed
this<00:02:48.700> bin<00:02:48.970> so<00:02:49.150> here<00:02:49.900> it<00:02:49.989> is<00:02:50.140> you<00:02:50.739> know<00:02:50.829> kind<00:02:51.069> of

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
this bin so here it is you know kind of

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.640 
this bin so here it is you know kind of
from<00:02:51.190> the<00:02:51.280> bottom

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
from the bottom

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.220 
from the bottom
and<00:02:53.120> what<00:02:54.120> I'm<00:02:54.180> gonna<00:02:54.299> do<00:02:54.510> to<00:02:54.659> show<00:02:54.930> you<00:02:54.989> this

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
and what I'm gonna do to show you this

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.199 
and what I'm gonna do to show you this
is<00:02:56.010> just<00:02:56.159> kind<00:02:56.370> of<00:02:56.400> take<00:02:56.610> it<00:02:56.730> apart<00:02:57.000> a<00:02:57.120> little

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
is just kind of take it apart a little

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.410 
is just kind of take it apart a little
bit<00:02:57.890> so<00:02:58.890> I<00:02:58.920> can<00:02:59.129> show<00:02:59.430> you<00:02:59.489> the<00:02:59.670> nest<00:02:59.970> itself

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
bit so I can show you the nest itself

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.240 
bit so I can show you the nest itself
kind<00:03:01.140> of<00:03:01.230> how<00:03:01.319> about<00:03:01.500> to<00:03:01.620> put<00:03:01.799> together<00:03:04.250> so

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
kind of how about to put together so

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.000 
kind of how about to put together so
there's<00:03:05.430> all<00:03:05.670> these<00:03:05.849> hinge<00:03:06.659> pieces<00:03:07.319> that<00:03:07.860> are

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
there's all these hinge pieces that are

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:15.319 
there's all these hinge pieces that are
on<00:03:08.959> eight<00:03:11.659> this<00:03:12.659> is<00:03:12.780> the<00:03:12.870> other<00:03:13.019> side<00:03:14.209> so<00:03:15.209> this

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
on eight this is the other side so this

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:18.920 
on eight this is the other side so this
is<00:03:15.510> what<00:03:15.659> we're<00:03:15.810> jumping<00:03:15.989> over<00:03:16.409> and<00:03:17.780> you<00:03:18.780> know

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
is what we're jumping over and you know

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.780 
is what we're jumping over and you know
I've<00:03:19.620> got<00:03:19.769> some<00:03:19.950> Technic<00:03:20.340> pieces<00:03:20.579> in<00:03:20.849> there

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
I've got some Technic pieces in there

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:28.569 
I've got some Technic pieces in there
and<00:03:23.930> then<00:03:24.930> these<00:03:25.379> leaves<00:03:25.970> do<00:03:26.970> act<00:03:27.269> as<00:03:27.599> ramps

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:28.579 
and then these leaves do act as ramps

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:34.690 
and then these leaves do act as ramps
the<00:03:29.579> object<00:03:30.299> here<00:03:30.900> is<00:03:31.549> to<00:03:32.549> have<00:03:32.760> your<00:03:33.180> speedor

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
the object here is to have your speedor

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.899 
the object here is to have your speedor
launched<00:03:35.930> over<00:03:36.930> the<00:03:37.049> nest<00:03:37.260> and<00:03:37.760> the<00:03:38.760> way<00:03:38.849> you

00:03:38.899 --> 00:03:38.909 
launched over the nest and the way you

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:42.050 
launched over the nest and the way you
do<00:03:39.150> that<00:03:39.359> is<00:03:39.659> by<00:03:40.049> hopefully<00:03:40.879> hitting<00:03:41.879> these

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
do that is by hopefully hitting these

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.940 
do that is by hopefully hitting these
leaves<00:03:42.390> that<00:03:42.569> act<00:03:42.810> as<00:03:42.989> ramps<00:03:43.470> and<00:03:43.650> you<00:03:43.739> want<00:03:43.890> to

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
leaves that act as ramps and you want to

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.030 
leaves that act as ramps and you want to
launch<00:03:44.359> clear<00:03:45.359> over<00:03:45.900> the<00:03:45.989> nest<00:03:46.170> so<00:03:46.920> we're

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
launch clear over the nest so we're

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.930 
launch clear over the nest so we're
gonna<00:03:47.159> give<00:03:47.370> this<00:03:47.489> a<00:03:47.549> try

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
gonna give this a try

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.479 
gonna give this a try
a<00:03:48.209> couple<00:03:48.900> of<00:03:48.989> times<00:03:49.170> now<00:03:49.620> this<00:03:50.159> kind<00:03:50.340> of

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
a couple of times now this kind of

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.630 
a couple of times now this kind of
slides<00:03:51.200> like<00:03:52.200> a<00:03:52.260> lot<00:03:52.560> of<00:03:52.709> these<00:03:52.799> speed<00:03:53.129> or<00:03:53.280> sets

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
slides like a lot of these speed or sets

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.960 
slides like a lot of these speed or sets
kind<00:03:54.569> of<00:03:54.659> wish<00:03:54.810> they<00:03:54.989> would<00:03:55.170> stay<00:03:55.409> in<00:03:55.440> place

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
kind of wish they would stay in place

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.640 
kind of wish they would stay in place
but<00:03:56.970> we're<00:03:57.510> just<00:03:57.660> gonna<00:03:57.780> give<00:03:57.989> it<00:03:58.049> a<00:03:58.139> shot<00:03:58.380> here

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
but we're just gonna give it a shot here

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.569 
but we're just gonna give it a shot here
we<00:03:58.769> go

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:01.579 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:04.849 

yeah<00:04:02.810> so<00:04:03.810> something<00:04:04.139> like<00:04:04.169> that<00:04:04.319> that

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
yeah so something like that that

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:07.400 
yeah so something like that that
actually<00:04:05.250> launched<00:04:05.730> really<00:04:06.209> well<00:04:06.419> we<00:04:07.260> can

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
actually launched really well we can

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.430 
actually launched really well we can
kind<00:04:07.650> of<00:04:07.709> see<00:04:07.919> that<00:04:08.069> it<00:04:08.220> did<00:04:08.459> hit<00:04:08.760> that<00:04:09.690> part<00:04:10.019> so

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
kind of see that it did hit that part so

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:17.210 
kind of see that it did hit that part so
that<00:04:10.859> is<00:04:11.280> why<00:04:11.489> it<00:04:11.549> moved<00:04:15.019> all<00:04:16.019> right<00:04:16.200> now<00:04:17.039> this

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
that is why it moved all right now this

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.039 
that is why it moved all right now this
set<00:04:17.459> was<00:04:17.760> a<00:04:17.789> lot<00:04:18.060> of<00:04:18.090> fun

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
set was a lot of fun

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.500 
set was a lot of fun
again<00:04:19.739> this<00:04:19.919> set<00:04:20.160> goes<00:04:20.400> with<00:04:20.639> two<00:04:20.910> other<00:04:21.150> sets

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
again this set goes with two other sets

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.600 
again this set goes with two other sets
seven<00:04:21.810> zero<00:04:22.019> one<00:04:22.139> zero<00:04:22.169> four<00:04:22.740> and<00:04:22.770> seven<00:04:23.310> zero

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
seven zero one zero four and seven zero

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.710 
seven zero one zero four and seven zero
one<00:04:23.820> zero<00:04:23.849> six<00:04:24.650> that<00:04:25.650> ice<00:04:25.919> tower<00:04:26.389> so<00:04:27.389> we<00:04:27.419> want

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
one zero six that ice tower so we want

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.659 
one zero six that ice tower so we want
to<00:04:27.810> run<00:04:30.470> and<00:04:31.470> here's<00:04:31.770> just<00:04:31.919> a<00:04:32.010> look<00:04:32.250> for<00:04:32.520> you

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:32.669 
to run and here's just a look for you

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:35.180 
to run and here's just a look for you
where<00:04:32.940> you<00:04:32.970> do<00:04:33.330> want<00:04:33.510> to<00:04:33.690> try<00:04:34.620> and<00:04:34.889> get<00:04:35.039> all

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
where you do want to try and get all

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.480 
where you do want to try and get all
three<00:04:35.639> of<00:04:35.669> these<00:04:35.820> sets<00:04:36.060> if<00:04:36.240> you<00:04:36.389> can<00:04:37.220> so<00:04:38.220> we<00:04:38.280> go

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
three of these sets if you can so we go

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.540 
three of these sets if you can so we go
through<00:04:38.820> here<00:04:39.740> over<00:04:40.740> the<00:04:40.860> nest<00:04:41.070> that<00:04:41.220> we<00:04:41.340> just

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
through here over the nest that we just

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.180 
through here over the nest that we just
built<00:04:41.820> to<00:04:42.449> the<00:04:42.599> ice<00:04:42.720> tower<00:04:43.050> try<00:04:43.620> and<00:04:43.770> knock<00:04:43.949> the

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
built to the ice tower try and knock the

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.339 
built to the ice tower try and knock the
Chi<00:04:44.400> ball<00:04:44.639> out<00:04:44.910> of<00:04:45.030> this<00:04:45.210> tower<00:04:45.510> I<00:04:45.810> gotta<00:04:46.080> say<00:04:46.320> I

00:04:46.339 --> 00:04:46.349 
Chi ball out of this tower I gotta say I

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:50.380 
Chi ball out of this tower I gotta say I
am<00:04:46.680> surprised<00:04:47.340> on<00:04:47.699> how<00:04:47.760> well<00:04:48.389> these<00:04:48.690> leap

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:50.390 
am surprised on how well these leap

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:53.180 
am surprised on how well these leap
operated<00:04:51.390> as<00:04:51.570> ramps<00:04:52.080> because<00:04:52.800> we<00:04:53.040> weren't

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
operated as ramps because we weren't

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.700 
operated as ramps because we weren't
able<00:04:53.460> to<00:04:53.610> hit<00:04:53.850> it<00:04:53.970> and<00:04:54.090> launch<00:04:54.300> off<00:04:54.710> pretty

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
able to hit it and launch off pretty

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.960 
able to hit it and launch off pretty
successfully<00:04:56.840> every<00:04:57.840> time<00:04:58.020> we<00:04:58.170> try<00:04:58.490> so<00:04:59.490> this

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
successfully every time we try so this

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.020 
successfully every time we try so this
set<00:05:00.300> is<00:05:01.070> better<00:05:02.070> than<00:05:02.370> average<00:05:02.490> of<00:05:02.850> money

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
set is better than average of money

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:04.880 
set is better than average of money
we'll<00:05:03.420> probably<00:05:03.630> will<00:05:03.900> have<00:05:04.020> better<00:05:04.290> speed<00:05:04.770> or

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:04.890 
we'll probably will have better speed or

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:05.900 
we'll probably will have better speed or
system<00:05:05.370> yeah

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
system yeah

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.430 
system yeah
so<00:05:06.120> let<00:05:06.330> us<00:05:06.420> know<00:05:06.600> what<00:05:06.750> you<00:05:06.840> think<00:05:07.050> about<00:05:07.110> this

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
so let us know what you think about this
