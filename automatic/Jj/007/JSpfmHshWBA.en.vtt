00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:24.000
 definitely a place of powerful sports 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.070
 cars not in the city but on racing 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.689
 track where at high speed you need 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.210
 go into sharp turns 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.390
 great solution for this kind 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.850
 tasks will be summer tires michelin pilot 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.309
 sport 3 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.920
 it's always interesting to see how technology 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.309
 born in the crucible of motor racing 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.309
 come to ordinary drivers 10 years 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.730
 continuous racing 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:53.070
 24 hours Lehman allowed to accumulate experience 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.870
 reflected pilot series 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.120
 sport 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.620
 tire michelin pilot sport 3 is 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.059
 third generation sport tires and 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.640
 intended for owners 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.250
 sports cars and powerful versions 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.100
 first of all sedans 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.920
 provide not only the highest 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:15.119
 level of comfort and safety on 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:18.240
 wet and dry road but also handling 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.070
 which is designed to provide bright emotions 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.780
 movement owner sports 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.159
 car and for this were applied 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:29.100
 two new technologies in rubber compound 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:31.159
 on the newest height meter here's a mushroom which 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.840
 allows thanks to its increased 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.460
 flexibility provides grip with 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.000
 slightest bumps in the road and 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:42.210
 break the water film and also changed 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.579
 tire tread profile so -called 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.840
 anti - Sov approach that reduced 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:50.359
 the amount in the shoulder area is excessive 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.920
 rubber which reduces the possibility 

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:54.250
 the occurrence of aquaplaning so 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.620
 tire float at 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.930
 plenty of water on the road this is something 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.930
 that provides unmatched 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.650
 security in particular we managed on 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.479
 three meters 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.970
 shorten the braking distance compared 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.890
 previous generation scheme is that 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.090
 Regards dry grip this 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.200
 very important for sports owners 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.209
 cars 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.250
 here technologies were applied 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.390
 including come from the world of motor racing 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.620
 endurance racing namely 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.500
 rubber compound components 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.390
 this is how the protector 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.989
 balanced to seek 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.340
 required heating temperature for 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:34.239
 getting the right clutch then 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:36.580
 keeping it in a narrow range for 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:38.800
 to prevent us from overheating those or 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.690
 other tread block elements are high 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.250
 speeds and heavy loads on the tire 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.560
 define requirements 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.239
 special requirements for tire reliability 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.900
 michelin pilot sport 3 was developed 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:52.209
 together with mercedes partners 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:55.810
 bringing this tire to its final version 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:59.709
 we tested it on the most powerful versions 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:03.459
 such cars as c and e class to them 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:05.830
 under maximum loads of speed and 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.959
 manageability and therefore technology 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.790
 which were used in it allow 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:10.530
 reliably control including 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.450
 possible 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.610
 tire deformation caused by large 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.590
 by speed 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:20.769
 move on to the specific details of this 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.780
 outstanding tires already in the title 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:23.829
 michelin pilot sport 3 laid 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.230
 the ideologies of this bus 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:28.000
 But it is that this model 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.110
 designed specifically for sports 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.420
 powerful cars 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.549
 allowing a safe ride on a very 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.190
 high speeds that means wife 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:37.030
 must withstand extreme loads 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.590
 this was achieved thanks to 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.720
 use a new component 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.600
 polymer compound long lasting 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.790
 it is thanks to him that the tire is very durable 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.280
 on rupture and dense homogeneous composition 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.170
 rubber compound provides the most 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.329
 high grip characteristics 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.820
 maximum loads that can be said 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:57.489
 about tread pattern tread pattern 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:59.470
 here is asymmetrical and very successful 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:02.049
 optimized precisely because of this 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:04.510
 the tire effectively breaks the water film 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:05.110
 and quickly removes excess moisture from the stain 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.640
 contact 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.500
 if any features are three times lower 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.510
 for example the sidewall feature of the structure 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.709
 sidewalls here such that allows 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.090
 provide the highest 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:15.010
 characteristics with active 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.900
 maneuvering is very fast and very 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.669
 accurate steering response on 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.169
 I want to sharpen this bus example 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:22.210
 attention to the fact that most 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:24.550
 sports tires produced in 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.919
 low profile sizes such tires 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.349
 more likely to damage so when 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:31.349
 their operation needs to be as 

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:31.349
 neat
