contenders<00:00:08.550> are<00:00:08.730> they<00:00:08.910> the<00:00:09.540> usual<00:00:10.019> ones<00:00:10.139> i

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
contenders are they the usual ones i

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.490 
contenders are they the usual ones i
think<00:00:10.889> that<00:00:11.269> the<00:00:12.269> competition's<00:00:12.929> got<00:00:13.200> much

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
think that the competition's got much

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.070 
think that the competition's got much
stronger<00:00:14.070> not<00:00:14.219> least<00:00:14.460> through<00:00:14.700> man<00:00:14.880> city<00:00:15.179> from

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
stronger not least through man city from

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.650 
stronger not least through man city from
the<00:00:16.199> traditional<00:00:16.410> for<00:00:17.160> but<00:00:18.029> also<00:00:18.180> of<00:00:18.420> course

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
the traditional for but also of course

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.720 
the traditional for but also of course
Tina<00:00:18.990> by<00:00:19.170> Tottenham<00:00:19.650> and<00:00:19.830> Newcastle<00:00:20.520> last

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
Tina by Tottenham and Newcastle last

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.939 
Tina by Tottenham and Newcastle last
year<00:00:21.000> Everton<00:00:21.480> with<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.170> star<00:00:22.439> they've<00:00:22.680> had

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
year Everton with the star they've had

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.519 
year Everton with the star they've had
so<00:00:23.640> I<00:00:23.670> think<00:00:23.820> it's<00:00:24.150> good<00:00:24.779> for<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.080> game<00:00:25.230> that

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
so I think it's good for the game that

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:34.639 
so I think it's good for the game that
it's<00:00:26.519> not<00:00:27.150> getting<00:00:27.359> easier<00:00:27.599> I<00:00:33.440> think<00:00:34.440> one<00:00:34.620> of

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
it's not getting easier I think one of

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.290 
it's not getting easier I think one of
the<00:00:34.829> major<00:00:35.010> things<00:00:35.340> is<00:00:35.550> going<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.850> be<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:36.059> try

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
the major things is going to be to try

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.810 
the major things is going to be to try
and<00:00:36.329> ensure<00:00:36.540> that<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.280> national<00:00:38.280> team<00:00:38.520> gets

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
and ensure that the national team gets

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.540 
and ensure that the national team gets
more<00:00:39.059> access<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.829> players<00:00:41.250> at<00:00:41.520> the

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
more access to the to the players at the

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.880 
more access to the to the players at the
club<00:00:41.879> so<00:00:42.059> we<00:00:42.090> get<00:00:42.329> more<00:00:42.540> chance<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:43.140> work<00:00:43.620> with

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
club so we get more chance to work with

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.580 
club so we get more chance to work with
them<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.129> see<00:00:44.520> them<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:45.510> our<00:00:45.629> scouting<00:00:46.170> our

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
them to see them that our scouting our

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.549 
them to see them that our scouting our
recruitment<00:00:47.039> is<00:00:47.399> improved<00:00:48.210> so<00:00:48.510> that<00:00:48.539> no<00:00:49.320> one

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
recruitment is improved so that no one

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.580 
recruitment is improved so that no one
is<00:00:49.739> being<00:00:50.039> missed<00:00:50.399> out<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:51.180> so<00:00:52.050> we're<00:00:52.199> losing

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
is being missed out and so we're losing

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.160 
is being missed out and so we're losing
an<00:00:52.739> opportunity<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:53.670> get<00:00:54.329> him<00:00:54.390> into<00:00:54.870> our

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
an opportunity to get him into our

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.830 
an opportunity to get him into our
system<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.770> onto<00:00:56.100> our<00:00:56.219> radar<00:00:56.460> at<00:00:57.360> an<00:00:57.510> early

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
system and onto our radar at an early

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.479 
system and onto our radar at an early
stage<00:00:57.870> we've<00:00:58.739> now<00:00:58.920> got<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.280> perfect

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
stage we've now got the perfect

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.670 
stage we've now got the perfect
environment<00:00:59.940> for<00:01:00.539> that<00:01:00.719> is<00:01:00.870> in<00:01:01.020> Georgia<00:01:01.320> part

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
environment for that is in Georgia part

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.910 
environment for that is in Georgia part
but<00:01:02.460> we've<00:01:02.640> got<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:03.090> work<00:01:03.780> constantly<00:01:04.589> with

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
but we've got to work constantly with

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.370 
but we've got to work constantly with
the<00:01:04.949> clubs<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.880> I'm<00:01:06.030> hoping<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.570> new<00:01:06.750> epp

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
the clubs and I'm hoping the new epp

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.620 
the clubs and I'm hoping the new epp
system<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.250> Academy's<00:01:08.790> all<00:01:09.240> of<00:01:09.479> these

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
system and the Academy's all of these

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.130 
system and the Academy's all of these
things<00:01:09.900> will<00:01:10.170> move<00:01:10.409> us<00:01:10.710> closer<00:01:11.490> maybe<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.450> what

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
things will move us closer maybe to what

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.870 
things will move us closer maybe to what
Spain<00:01:13.560> perhaps<00:01:13.950> have<00:01:14.100> had<00:01:14.280> for<00:01:14.549> a<00:01:14.580> number<00:01:14.700> of

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
Spain perhaps have had for a number of

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.700 
Spain perhaps have had for a number of
years

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.950 

I<00:01:18.799> don't<00:01:19.610> know<00:01:19.850> I'd<00:01:20.060> have<00:01:20.180> to<00:01:20.299> do<00:01:20.390> that<00:01:20.570> I<00:01:20.630> mean

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
I don't know I'd have to do that I mean

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.480 
I don't know I'd have to do that I mean
I<00:01:20.990> suppose<00:01:21.440> the<00:01:21.619> obvious<00:01:21.890> answer<00:01:22.010> is<00:01:22.280> Leo

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
I suppose the obvious answer is Leo

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.060 
I suppose the obvious answer is Leo
Messi<00:01:22.850> I<00:01:23.030> suppose<00:01:23.360> because<00:01:24.260> he<00:01:24.440> does<00:01:24.680> seem<00:01:24.950> to

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
Messi I suppose because he does seem to

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.630 
Messi I suppose because he does seem to
have<00:01:25.159> the<00:01:25.420> ability<00:01:26.420> to<00:01:26.960> to<00:01:27.560> win<00:01:27.860> games<00:01:28.220> off<00:01:28.490> his

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
have the ability to to win games off his

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.330 
have the ability to to win games off his
own<00:01:28.820> bat<00:01:29.119> it's<00:01:29.540> a<00:01:29.630> difficult<00:01:29.840> one<00:01:30.200> but<00:01:30.470> if<00:01:31.100> I

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
own bat it's a difficult one but if I

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.190 
own bat it's a difficult one but if I
must<00:01:31.670> give<00:01:31.909> an<00:01:32.000> answer<00:01:32.150> I'll<00:01:32.509> take<00:01:32.840> me<00:01:33.020> in<00:01:33.110> or

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
must give an answer I'll take me in or

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:39.130 
must give an answer I'll take me in or
missing<00:01:37.119> that<00:01:38.119> would<00:01:38.240> help<00:01:38.390> enormously<00:01:38.780> I

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
missing that would help enormously I

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.109 
missing that would help enormously I
think<00:01:39.470> we've<00:01:39.560> had<00:01:39.680> great<00:01:39.890> support<00:01:40.220> so<00:01:40.670> far<00:01:40.700> me

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
think we've had great support so far me

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:43.930 
think we've had great support so far me
it's<00:01:41.259> obviously<00:01:42.259> very<00:01:42.380> early<00:01:43.040> in<00:01:43.070> my<00:01:43.399> time<00:01:43.700> at

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
it's obviously very early in my time at

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.540 
it's obviously very early in my time at
an<00:01:44.240> England<00:01:45.050> manager<00:01:45.500> we<00:01:45.590> had<00:01:45.740> almost<00:01:46.070> a<00:01:46.310> full

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
an England manager we had almost a full

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.570 
an England manager we had almost a full
house<00:01:46.790> to<00:01:47.659> see<00:01:47.840> us<00:01:47.960> play<00:01:48.259> against<00:01:48.740> Belgium

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
house to see us play against Belgium

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.580 
house to see us play against Belgium
yeah<00:01:49.759> that<00:01:49.940> was<00:01:50.060> a<00:01:50.090> you<00:01:50.780> know<00:01:50.899> for<00:01:51.110> me<00:01:51.229> quite

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
yeah that was a you know for me quite

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.859 
yeah that was a you know for me quite
phenomenal<00:01:51.830> that<00:01:52.399> almost<00:01:52.759> 90,000<00:01:53.720> people

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
phenomenal that almost 90,000 people

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.040 
phenomenal that almost 90,000 people
came<00:01:54.289> to<00:01:54.920> see<00:01:55.130> to<00:01:55.700> see<00:01:55.729> us<00:01:56.000> off<00:01:56.149> if<00:01:56.360> you<00:01:56.479> like<00:01:56.690> to

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 
came to see to see us off if you like to

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.109 
came to see to see us off if you like to
the<00:01:57.140> years<00:01:57.410> so<00:01:58.250> I've<00:01:58.429> been<00:01:58.640> very<00:01:58.820> very

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
the years so I've been very very

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:00.669 
the years so I've been very very
impressed<00:01:59.450> with<00:01:59.539> the<00:01:59.690> support<00:02:00.110> we've<00:02:00.289> had<00:02:00.320> and

00:02:00.669 --> 00:02:00.679 
impressed with the support we've had and

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:03.520 
impressed with the support we've had and
I<00:02:00.860> really<00:02:01.640> do<00:02:01.880> hope<00:02:02.119> that<00:02:02.179> people<00:02:02.720> keep<00:02:03.080> coming

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
I really do hope that people keep coming

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.310 
I really do hope that people keep coming
to<00:02:03.679> the<00:02:03.800> games<00:02:04.009> there's<00:02:04.610> no<00:02:04.759> doubt<00:02:04.789> that<00:02:05.330> you

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
to the games there's no doubt that you

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.380 
to the games there's no doubt that you
know<00:02:06.440> feeling<00:02:06.950> that<00:02:07.340> you<00:02:07.850> have<00:02:07.970> a<00:02:08.000> crowd

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
know feeling that you have a crowd

abroad<00:03:37.870> I<00:03:38.290> think<00:03:38.860> if<00:03:38.950> anything<00:03:39.220> it<00:03:39.460> shows<00:03:39.760> that

abroad I think if anything it shows that

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.880 
abroad I think if anything it shows that
we<00:03:40.390> have<00:03:40.570> the<00:03:41.110> fact<00:03:41.320> that<00:03:41.350> we<00:03:41.500> have<00:03:41.650> something

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
we have the fact that we have something

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.360 
we have the fact that we have something
shows<00:03:42.820> to<00:03:43.240> some<00:03:43.420> extent<00:03:43.780> of<00:03:43.870> how<00:03:43.990> powerful<00:03:44.710> the

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
shows to some extent of how powerful the

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.770 
shows to some extent of how powerful the
league<00:03:45.580> has<00:03:45.820> become

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.940 

but<00:03:50.780> we<00:03:50.960> don't<00:03:51.200> know<00:03:51.410> but<00:03:51.590> we've<00:03:51.770> been

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
but we don't know but we've been

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.730 
but we don't know but we've been
certainly<00:03:52.760> hampered<00:03:53.270> by<00:03:53.510> injuries<00:03:54.230> to<00:03:54.530> very
