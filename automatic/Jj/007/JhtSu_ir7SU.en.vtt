right<00:01:42.390> next<00:01:42.659> to<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:42.960> wait<00:01:43.110> for<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:43.380> oh<00:01:43.649> oh<00:01:44.250> it<00:01:44.759> is

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
right next to it wait for it oh oh it is

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.060 
right next to it wait for it oh oh it is
rather<00:01:45.090> not<00:01:45.990> right<00:01:46.229> next<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.619> him<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:46.860> as<00:01:46.950> you

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
rather not right next to him and as you

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.850 
rather not right next to him and as you
can<00:01:47.159> see<00:01:47.310> no<00:01:47.490> stars<00:01:47.700> no<00:01:47.939> stars<00:01:48.210> no<00:01:48.390> stars<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:49.200> I

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
can see no stars no stars no stars and I

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.980 
can see no stars no stars no stars and I
got<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.189> stars<00:01:50.579> so<00:01:51.149> this<00:01:51.390> is<00:01:51.540> probably<00:01:51.810> the

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
got the stars so this is probably the

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.719 
got the stars so this is probably the
only<00:01:52.170> way<00:01:52.380> now<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.590> enter<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:53.130> military<00:01:53.549> base

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
only way now to enter the military base

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.910 
only way now to enter the military base
you<00:01:53.850> can<00:01:54.000> say<00:01:54.149> this<00:01:54.329> is<00:01:54.390> confirmed<00:01:55.110> but<00:01:55.740> also

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
you can say this is confirmed but also

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:56.649 
you can say this is confirmed but also
was

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
was

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:59.380 
was
because<00:01:57.640> the<00:01:58.640> whole<00:01:58.820> myth<00:01:59.030> is<00:01:59.240> actually

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
because the whole myth is actually

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.810 
because the whole myth is actually
busted<00:02:00.200> and<00:02:00.350> there's<00:02:00.530> no<00:02:00.770> way<00:02:00.920> you<00:02:00.979> won't<00:02:01.520> hit

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
busted and there's no way you won't hit

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.090 
busted and there's no way you won't hit
any<00:02:02.119> stars<00:02:02.689> while<00:02:03.140> entering<00:02:03.560> it<00:02:03.710> you<00:02:03.860> just

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
any stars while entering it you just

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.980 
any stars while entering it you just
won't<00:02:04.640> get<00:02:04.789> any<00:02:05.060> stars<00:02:05.329> like<00:02:05.509> straight<00:02:05.780> away

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
won't get any stars like straight away

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.410 
won't get any stars like straight away
so<00:02:06.619> the<00:02:06.829> next<00:02:07.100> myth<00:02:07.280> is<00:02:07.310> driving<00:02:07.909> a<00:02:08.000> military

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
so the next myth is driving a military

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.300 
so the next myth is driving a military
vehicle<00:02:08.660> while<00:02:09.110> entering<00:02:09.470> the<00:02:09.649> military<00:02:09.800> base

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
vehicle while entering the military base

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.670 
vehicle while entering the military base
won't<00:02:10.580> give<00:02:10.880> you<00:02:11.030> any<00:02:11.239> stars<00:02:11.780> so<00:02:12.140> we<00:02:12.349> already
