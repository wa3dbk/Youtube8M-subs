were hitting the rev limiter at 5900
they<00:04:48.900> haven't<00:04:49.170> said<00:04:49.410> so<00:04:50.100> won't<00:04:50.310> let<00:04:50.520> us

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
they haven't said so won't let us

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.330 
they haven't said so won't let us
succeed<00:04:50.790> that<00:04:51.290> that<00:04:52.290> mark<00:04:52.650> and<00:04:52.980> you<00:04:53.310> know

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
succeed that that mark and you know

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.950

usually<00:04:53.610> we<00:04:53.880> cheat<00:04:54.150> a<00:04:54.180> little<00:04:54.330> bit<00:04:54.480> and<00:04:54.600> over

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
usually we cheat a little bit and over

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.900 
usually we cheat a little bit and over
rev<00:04:55.170> it<00:04:55.290> a<00:04:55.350> little<00:04:55.590> bit<00:04:55.770> couldn't<00:04:56.490> quite<00:04:56.640> do<00:04:56.790> it

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
rev it a little bit couldn't quite do it

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.940 
rev it a little bit couldn't quite do it
so<00:04:57.060> I<00:04:57.090> think<00:04:57.240> this<00:04:57.510> boat<00:04:57.750> if<00:04:57.900> you<00:04:58.020> could<00:04:58.230> trim

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
so I think this boat if you could trim

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.280 
so I think this boat if you could trim
it<00:04:59.100> all<00:04:59.670> the<00:04:59.880> way<00:04:59.970> up<00:05:00.150> it<00:05:00.330> would<00:05:00.480> go<00:05:01.020> even

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:01.290 
it all the way up it would go even

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.900 
it all the way up it would go even
faster

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:01.910 
faster

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:04.520 
faster
great<00:05:02.910> performance<00:05:03.480> we<00:05:03.600> have<00:05:03.690> a<00:05:03.750> 20<00:05:04.410> degree

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:04.530 
great performance we have a 20 degree

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.130 
great performance we have a 20 degree
dead<00:05:04.950> rise<00:05:05.190> hull<00:05:05.490> which<00:05:06.300> really<00:05:06.660> gives<00:05:06.840> us<00:05:06.990> a

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:07.140 
dead rise hull which really gives us a

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.440 
dead rise hull which really gives us a
nice<00:05:07.290> nice<00:05:08.220> ability<00:05:08.700> to<00:05:08.790> slice<00:05:09.030> through<00:05:09.270> the

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450 
nice nice ability to slice through the

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:11.390 
nice nice ability to slice through the
waves<00:05:09.630> it's<00:05:10.260> just<00:05:10.380> a<00:05:10.560> good

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
waves it's just a good

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.780
