hey<00:00:03.319> guys<00:00:03.529> this<00:00:03.799> video<00:00:03.980> is<00:00:04.189> about<00:00:04.609> one<00:00:05.149> of<00:00:05.240> the

00:00:05.289 --> 00:00:05.299 
hey guys this video is about one of the

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:07.809 
hey guys this video is about one of the
most<00:00:05.479> common<00:00:05.930> questions<00:00:06.109> I<00:00:06.529> get<00:00:06.859> and<00:00:07.129> that<00:00:07.609> is

00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:07.819 
most common questions I get and that is

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:10.930 
most common questions I get and that is
how<00:00:08.090> you<00:00:08.149> can<00:00:08.570> increase<00:00:09.080> the<00:00:09.320> speed<00:00:09.530> of<00:00:10.039> the

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:10.940 
how you can increase the speed of the

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.539 
how you can increase the speed of the
boot<00:00:11.299> time<00:00:11.630> of<00:00:11.870> your<00:00:12.019> computer<00:00:12.530> how<00:00:13.190> can<00:00:13.490> you

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:13.549 
boot time of your computer how can you

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:15.610 
boot time of your computer how can you
make<00:00:13.759> your<00:00:13.790> computer<00:00:14.360> boot<00:00:14.570> faster<00:00:15.230> than<00:00:15.500> it

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:15.620 
make your computer boot faster than it

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.729 
make your computer boot faster than it
already<00:00:15.769> does<00:00:16.330> now<00:00:17.330> computer<00:00:17.990> slowed<00:00:18.410> down

00:00:18.729 --> 00:00:18.739 
already does now computer slowed down

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:20.979 
already does now computer slowed down
over<00:00:19.310> time<00:00:19.550> for<00:00:20.000> a<00:00:20.029> lot<00:00:20.210> of<00:00:20.239> reasons<00:00:20.480> and<00:00:20.869> I'm

00:00:20.979 --> 00:00:20.989 
over time for a lot of reasons and I'm

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:22.510 
over time for a lot of reasons and I'm
not<00:00:21.169> going<00:00:21.320> to<00:00:21.380> get<00:00:21.529> into<00:00:21.770> that<00:00:21.890> in<00:00:22.040> this<00:00:22.160> video

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:22.520 
not going to get into that in this video

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.249 
not going to get into that in this video
but<00:00:23.059> there<00:00:23.239> is<00:00:23.360> something<00:00:23.660> you<00:00:23.750> can<00:00:23.840> do<00:00:23.989> right

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:24.259 
but there is something you can do right

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:26.170 
but there is something you can do right
now<00:00:24.320> that<00:00:24.770> doesn't<00:00:24.950> take<00:00:25.160> long<00:00:25.369> at<00:00:25.399> all<00:00:25.610> that

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
now that doesn't take long at all that

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.060 
now that doesn't take long at all that
will<00:00:26.300> allow<00:00:26.750> you<00:00:26.809> to<00:00:26.989> make<00:00:27.500> your<00:00:27.559> computer

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070 
will allow you to make your computer

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.190 
will allow you to make your computer
boot<00:00:28.279> a<00:00:28.369> lot<00:00:28.579> faster<00:00:29.149> you<00:00:29.689> see<00:00:29.899> when<00:00:30.079> you're

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:30.200 
boot a lot faster you see when you're

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.350 
boot a lot faster you see when you're
booting<00:00:30.410> up<00:00:30.710> a<00:00:30.919> computer<00:00:31.520> doesn't<00:00:31.820> use<00:00:32.149> all

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
booting up a computer doesn't use all

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.990 
booting up a computer doesn't use all
the<00:00:32.750> cores<00:00:33.230> to<00:00:33.590> start<00:00:33.980> up<00:00:34.160> so<00:00:34.730> you<00:00:34.789> can

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 
the cores to start up so you can

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.849 
the cores to start up so you can
actually<00:00:35.149> enable<00:00:35.539> it<00:00:35.780> so<00:00:35.809> your<00:00:36.050> computer<00:00:36.500> uses

00:00:36.849 --> 00:00:36.859 
actually enable it so your computer uses

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:40.180 
actually enable it so your computer uses
all<00:00:37.039> your<00:00:37.550> CPUs<00:00:38.359> cores<00:00:39.109> to<00:00:39.620> boot<00:00:39.920> up<00:00:40.129> the

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
all your CPUs cores to boot up the

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.009 
all your CPUs cores to boot up the
computer<00:00:40.940> and<00:00:40.969> it'll<00:00:41.239> go<00:00:41.449> a<00:00:41.480> lot<00:00:41.719> faster

00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:42.019 
computer and it'll go a lot faster

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:44.860 
computer and it'll go a lot faster
obviously<00:00:42.949> this<00:00:43.609> will<00:00:43.820> only<00:00:44.179> work<00:00:44.390> if<00:00:44.839> you

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
obviously this will only work if you

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.189 
obviously this will only work if you
have<00:00:45.050> a<00:00:45.260> multiple<00:00:46.039> core<00:00:46.429> processor<00:00:47.239> but<00:00:47.929> that

00:00:48.189 --> 00:00:48.199 
have a multiple core processor but that

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:50.099 
have a multiple core processor but that
won't<00:00:48.320> be<00:00:48.499> a<00:00:48.530> problem<00:00:48.589> if<00:00:49.190> your<00:00:49.339> computer<00:00:49.789> is

00:00:50.099 --> 00:00:50.109 
won't be a problem if your computer is

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:54.130 
won't be a problem if your computer is
recent<00:00:51.109> at<00:00:51.230> all<00:00:51.649> only<00:00:52.460> the<00:00:52.969> oldest<00:00:53.569> computers

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
recent at all only the oldest computers

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.220 
recent at all only the oldest computers
have<00:00:54.559> single<00:00:55.100> core<00:00:55.280> processors<00:00:55.909> now<00:00:55.940> and<00:00:56.420> I

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
have single core processors now and I

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.660 
have single core processors now and I
don't<00:00:57.530> even<00:00:57.649> think<00:00:57.800> they<00:00:58.069> sell<00:00:58.309> them<00:00:58.460> anymore

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
don't even think they sell them anymore

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.669 
don't even think they sell them anymore
so<00:00:58.999> let's<00:00:59.659> go<00:00:59.809> to<00:00:59.899> the<00:00:59.989> computer<00:01:00.260> and<00:01:00.589> I'll

00:01:00.669 --> 00:01:00.679 
so let's go to the computer and I'll

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:02.349 
so let's go to the computer and I'll
show<00:01:00.710> you<00:01:00.920> exactly<00:01:01.129> how<00:01:01.550> you<00:01:01.729> can<00:01:01.850> do<00:01:02.120> it<00:01:02.149> it

00:01:02.349 --> 00:01:02.359 
show you exactly how you can do it it

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:04.200 
show you exactly how you can do it it
shouldn't<00:01:02.569> take<00:01:02.809> more<00:01:03.019> than<00:01:03.079> a<00:01:03.260> few<00:01:03.499> seconds

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
shouldn't take more than a few seconds

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.020 
shouldn't take more than a few seconds
ok<00:01:05.210> so<00:01:05.269> here<00:01:05.840> we<00:01:05.870> are<00:01:05.960> in<00:01:06.560> Windows<00:01:07.190> now<00:01:08.000> you

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
ok so here we are in Windows now you

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.270 
ok so here we are in Windows now you
have<00:01:08.450> to<00:01:08.570> follow<00:01:08.720> this<00:01:08.900> extremely<00:01:09.590> carefully

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
have to follow this extremely carefully

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.210 
have to follow this extremely carefully
or<00:01:10.460> else<00:01:10.610> you<00:01:10.730> might<00:01:11.000> mess<00:01:11.240> up<00:01:11.420> your<00:01:11.570> computer

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
or else you might mess up your computer

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.620 
or else you might mess up your computer
basically<00:01:13.220> what<00:01:13.520> you<00:01:13.640> want<00:01:13.790> to<00:01:13.850> do<00:01:14.060> is<00:01:14.330> you

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
basically what you want to do is you

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.930 
basically what you want to do is you
want<00:01:14.840> to<00:01:15.020> go<00:01:15.260> to<00:01:15.320> the<00:01:15.680> Start<00:01:15.980> menu<00:01:16.040> and<00:01:16.370> then

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:16.940 
want to go to the Start menu and then

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:17.980 
want to go to the Start menu and then
open<00:01:17.300> up<00:01:17.390> something<00:01:17.690> called

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
open up something called

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.570

click anything I don't tell you to
number<00:01:48.680> of<00:01:48.830> processors<00:01:49.610> check<00:01:50.090> that<00:01:50.420> now<00:01:50.660> as

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:50.870 
number of processors check that now as

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.110 
number of processors check that now as
you<00:01:51.020> can<00:01:51.110> see<00:01:51.170> the<00:01:51.440> default<00:01:51.680> is<00:01:52.130> 1<00:01:52.640> so<00:01:52.970> it's
