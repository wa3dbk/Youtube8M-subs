00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:06.230
 the optical effect gave the feeling is of 

00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:06.230
 30 days 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:13.230
 Well first you put forward another 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.780
 but side then goes to the other 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.360
 good 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.080
 the most disco piano party of the 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.080
 last times 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:35.130
 from the right from murray to valdés to 0 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.120
 I do not know if tomás is still thinking 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.940
 David in the calculation failure to ask 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:46.120
 more world the hawk eye I think that 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.460
 has asked because I really thought that 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.750
 your recovery congratulations and then to 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.460
 final has come out a little longer than 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.640
 what he thought and preferred 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.660
 play it 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.660
 and there it has gone wrong 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:05.050
 now removes the warning and applies the 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.050
 Murray notice for time 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.920
 it goes the ball really gets 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.060
 complicated 3 to 0 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.560
 goriz 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.820
 be called as these next 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.800
 scores of who is going to escape 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.740
 of indefectible way and murray that follow 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.119
 making gestures 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.659
 if you were about to fall in the grave 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.640
 but not 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:37.149
 terrible player in this kind of 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.149
 situations 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:50.050
 the ball is going 40 this is already too much 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:52.270
 and in this match to the physical and 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:58.020
 we imagine recovering the domain break 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:58.020
 but it is complicated other worse things 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.850
 in the past there are no other things have been 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:06.220
 achieved but yes it is true that no 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.929
 only land that you're thinking of 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.239
 this forum also 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.609
 they mix things mix that 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:14.299
 Party thinking from the point of 

00:02:13.609 --> 00:02:16.430
 party too 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:18.260
 murray improve murray deceives you 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.709
 it seems that it is outside the party that 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:24.859
 is already with a broken leg with the arm 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:28.410
 in a sling and in the end he ends up playing 

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:30.250
 good points is also clear 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.260
 it's hard 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.500
 and fight against a player of this 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.500
 caliber 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:28.690
 and from there to fail the total stone 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.690
 in very hard after what he has had 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:34.270
 have to fight after two hours and 43 minutes 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:38.200
 the tie-break is put in the situation 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:40.569
 very clear so we see how it stays 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.300
 bouncing how can you hold 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:45.760
 because even if I do not win this tournament 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.739
 champions to asylum to the hard and the 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.110
 village and management appreciates that there is a 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:51.680
 track 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:54.290
 David Ferrer will not appear 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.599
 after that 51 and murray with the possibility 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.670
 to go find now neither more nor less than 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:04.489
 five match balls 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:06.680
 that you can not stop at once 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:07.940
 sometime but always after the 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.530
 match 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.530
 and I was stiff in the camera 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:23.580
 davidson 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:27.449
 because I really do not know if clear and now 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:30.470
 everything has this game gives another 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:30.470
 back then I already 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:36.919
 to the track 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.919
 and I put on the referee costume 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.900
 first match-ball for the Scotsman 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:46.810
 let's remember something 1 before this death 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:49.110
 Sudden so hard so hard for David 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.110
 ferrer 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.220
 on the street still waiting for a miracle of 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:55.220
 life 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:01.630
 I do not know if he's going to be able to get a good 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.630
 second service 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:08.950
 is that you can not you can not finish 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:11.200
 the story of an incredible final 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:13.630
 and it is believed that he has been able to win this 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:16.720
 match or murray is what he has fought 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:19.810
 he is a great champion we recognize him all 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:22.920
 its virtues but take off this final 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:25.150
 of the game has left us with a script 

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:27.660
 corresponds to the absurdity that has been 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:30.160
 the whole plot of this meeting 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:32.020
 first face the dirt of course and 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:35.110
 I'll take all the effort of the 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.550
 sight has battled against everything because 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:39.880
 we were saying he was not playing well 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:43.480
 has been able to try to trace a 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:47.070
 almost impossible match even be still 

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.070
 a centimeter to win the game
