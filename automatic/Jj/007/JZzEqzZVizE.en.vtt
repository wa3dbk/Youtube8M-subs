what<00:02:19.170> is<00:02:19.260> just<00:02:19.440> betting<00:02:19.680> it<00:02:19.800> to<00:02:19.890> you<00:02:20.010> guys<00:02:20.190> I'm

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
what is just betting it to you guys I'm

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.119 
what is just betting it to you guys I'm
kind<00:02:21.270> of<00:02:21.450> on<00:02:21.690> the<00:02:21.870> same<00:02:22.140> boat<00:02:22.379> in<00:02:22.590> its<00:02:22.709> loop<00:02:22.890> and

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
kind of on the same boat in its loop and

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:26.030 
kind of on the same boat in its loop and
I<00:02:23.190> understand<00:02:23.670> and<00:02:24.030> I<00:02:24.360> think<00:02:25.020> it<00:02:25.200> sucks<00:02:25.650> more

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
I understand and I think it sucks more

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.979 
I understand and I think it sucks more
because<00:02:26.340> you<00:02:26.940> know<00:02:27.060> if<00:02:27.180> we<00:02:27.209> work<00:02:27.540> at<00:02:27.660> the<00:02:27.780> gym

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
because you know if we work at the gym

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:29.270 
because you know if we work at the gym
and<00:02:28.140> then<00:02:28.230> we<00:02:28.319> clean<00:02:28.560> it<00:02:28.709> up<00:02:28.770> so<00:02:28.860> it's<00:02:28.980> like<00:02:29.099> we

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
and then we clean it up so it's like we

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.490 
and then we clean it up so it's like we
obviously<00:02:29.640> we're<00:02:30.030> more<00:02:30.239> exposed<00:02:30.629> to<00:02:30.840> it<00:02:31.019> but

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
obviously we're more exposed to it but

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.509 
obviously we're more exposed to it but
at<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.680> same<00:02:31.800> time<00:02:32.010> you<00:02:32.099> gotta<00:02:32.250> think<00:02:32.400> about

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
at the same time you gotta think about

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:36.229 
at the same time you gotta think about
the<00:02:32.670> next<00:02:32.940> person<00:02:33.180> like<00:02:33.900> just<00:02:34.379> because<00:02:35.239> like

like<00:02:51.750> dumping<00:02:52.050> the<00:02:52.170> weights<00:02:52.440> way<00:02:52.590> but<00:02:53.010> I<00:02:53.040> think

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
like dumping the weights way but I think

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.630

the most thing that annoys me is like
doing<00:02:56.640> a<00:02:56.879> movement<00:02:57.180> that<00:02:57.510> you<00:02:58.170> don't<00:02:58.319> need<00:02:58.440> to

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
doing a movement that you don't need to

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.020 
doing a movement that you don't need to
do<00:02:58.650> it<00:02:58.680> like<00:02:59.099> for<00:02:59.250> instance<00:02:59.400> like<00:02:59.700> like
