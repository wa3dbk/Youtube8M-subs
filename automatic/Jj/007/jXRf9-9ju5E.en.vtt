00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.540
 find for my first tutorial of my 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.309
 youtube channel so already so I'm going 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.500
 explain how to properly configure 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.849
 your computer under windows 8 it can serve 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.160
 to many people I have not found 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.260
 a lot of videos because there's no 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.670
 long my computer mouse of my life so 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.980
 So here we begin under your 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.740
 keyboard you have because not bad the 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.289
 mans the cod say but I believe we are 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.939
 blues is everything but no it's just 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.160
 because the ama that rings do not make 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.859
 account but here on your keyboard 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.950
 at the bottom next to them and to lt 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.690
 between malt and elf m there is the logo 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.780
 windows you tap on it and you 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.980
 fall on that so here you have the 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.760
 news windows internet games 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:49.140
 you have everything that's going on 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:51.090
 So here you go up there 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.670
 have the court avatar checked 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:57.059
 it's very important because it's here 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.199
 you will define your screen so there 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.949
 it's the lock screen it's 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.480
 like you it's like when you're 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.119
 signed your computer and you feared 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.970
 him but he'll have to press click 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.820
 left and fell on the screen of 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.610
 lock that's it then so 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.400
 this is the home screen high school is 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.680
 that's it after there is the barrier of 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.930
 very important tale so rahnavard the 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.729
 so be it or not you download 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.830
 a photo you find on the internet 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.100
 either you take a picture directly 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.869
 with the camera so the user the 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.420
 bottle touching passwords 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.750
 and modified image passwords you 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.920
 can also add a user 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.049
 notification so we do not touch everything 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.659
 what is there then this is what you 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.659
 want gold that's what you want 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:51.720
 can you disable or 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:55.890
 active and any application 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.570
 of the ray that's it you do not worry it's 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.189
 not because I'm a child it's 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:04.079
 because those voices are good 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:06.439
 displaying proving so so here's in 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.640
 do look at this is to know 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:11.459

 also in economics 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:52.599
 so I'm using it a lot because 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.140
 when you unplug the purchase from your 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:57.159

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:05.379
 veiled veiled after c lesser breaks 

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:07.389
 so now we'll go to how 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:09.959
 to have applications that 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:16.659
