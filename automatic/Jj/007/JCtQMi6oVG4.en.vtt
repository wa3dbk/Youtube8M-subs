what<00:00:27.480> I'm<00:00:27.570> looking<00:00:27.599> for<00:00:28.199> I<00:00:28.410> know<00:00:28.470> I<00:00:28.590> downgraded

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920

basically<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:43.710> answer<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.190> quick<00:00:44.370> answer<00:00:44.550> is

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
basically the answer the quick answer is

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.520 
basically the answer the quick answer is
no<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.390> D<00:00:45.539> 3100<00:00:46.410> has<00:00:46.649> all<00:00:47.010> of<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:48.140> flaws<00:00:49.140> or

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
no the D 3100 has all of the flaws or

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.160 
no the D 3100 has all of the flaws or
handicaps<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.789> D<00:00:50.910> 5100<00:00:51.629> no<00:00:51.750> manual

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
handicaps of the D 5100 no manual

handicaps of the D 5100 no manual
exposure<00:00:52.469> on<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.579> D<00:00:53.730> 3100<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:55.559> would<00:00:55.829> say

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
exposure on the D 3100 and I would say

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.310 
exposure on the D 3100 and I would say
from<00:00:56.399> what<00:00:56.520> I've<00:00:56.640> seen<00:00:56.670> I<00:00:57.239> have<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.570> be<00:00:57.660> 3100

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
from what I've seen I have to be 3100

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.220 
from what I've seen I have to be 3100
the<00:00:58.800> codec<00:00:59.489> on<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.850> 3100<00:01:00.420> seems<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.079> be<00:01:01.199> a

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
the codec on the 3100 seems to be a

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.039 
the codec on the 3100 seems to be a
lower<00:01:01.440> quality<00:01:01.890> codec<00:01:02.879> that's<00:01:03.090> that's<00:01:03.390> what

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
lower quality codec that's that's what

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.660 
lower quality codec that's that's what
it's<00:01:04.170> using<00:01:04.500> if<00:01:04.589> you<00:01:04.650> don't<00:01:04.799> know<00:01:04.860> codec<00:01:05.280> is<00:01:05.460> to

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
it's using if you don't know codec is to

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.429 
it's using if you don't know codec is to
encode<00:01:06.000> that's<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.479> basically<00:01:07.350> the

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
encode that's the basically the

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.230 
encode that's the basically the
encryption<00:01:07.920> algorithm<00:01:08.220> for<00:01:08.670> recording<00:01:09.119> the

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
encryption algorithm for recording the

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.740 
encryption algorithm for recording the
video<00:01:09.510> so<00:01:10.439> it's<00:01:10.530> not<00:01:10.619> as<00:01:10.740> good<00:01:11.040> as<00:01:11.250> on<00:01:11.640> the

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
video so it's not as good as on the

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.090 
video so it's not as good as on the
d7000<00:01:12.750> I've<00:01:12.869> seen<00:01:13.110> actually<00:01:13.409> some<00:01:13.560> of<00:01:13.590> my<00:01:13.770> my

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
d7000 I've seen actually some of my my

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.740 
d7000 I've seen actually some of my my
programs<00:01:14.610> that<00:01:14.760> I<00:01:14.880> use<00:01:14.909> like<00:01:15.150> Sony<00:01:15.540> Vegas

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
programs that I use like Sony Vegas

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.140 
programs that I use like Sony Vegas
don't<00:01:16.350> seem<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.740> like<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:16.950> as<00:01:17.220> much<00:01:17.250> either<00:01:17.729> so

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
don't seem to like it as much either so

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.350 
don't seem to like it as much either so
quick<00:01:19.020> answer<00:01:19.380> no<00:01:19.770> I<00:01:20.009> wouldn't<00:01:20.490> say<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:21.210> D

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
quick answer no I wouldn't say the D

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.090 
quick answer no I wouldn't say the D

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
exposure control and again I'll

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.160 
exposure control and again I'll
reiterate<00:01:43.290> it<00:01:43.890> does<00:01:44.220> not<00:01:44.460> do<00:01:44.939> manual<00:01:45.899> exposure

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
reiterate it does not do manual exposure

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.679 
reiterate it does not do manual exposure
control<00:01:46.680> it<00:01:46.829> has<00:01:46.950> some<00:01:47.220> workarounds<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.479> can

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
control it has some workarounds you can

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.270 
control it has some workarounds you can
fiddle<00:01:48.960> with<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.350> exposure<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.070> point

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
fiddle with the exposure to the point

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.950 
fiddle with the exposure to the point
that<00:01:50.369> you<00:01:50.520> like<00:01:50.729> it<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.000> then<00:01:51.090> lock<00:01:51.390> it<00:01:51.630> in

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
that you like it and then lock it in

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.990 
that you like it and then lock it in
that's<00:01:52.380> not<00:01:52.530> manual<00:01:52.950> exposure<00:01:53.250> control<00:01:53.759> some

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
that's not manual exposure control some

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.850 
that's not manual exposure control some
people<00:01:54.240> seem<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.390> think<00:01:54.540> it<00:01:54.750> is<00:01:54.780> but<00:01:54.899> manual

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
people seem to think it is but manual

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.399 
people seem to think it is but manual
exposure<00:01:56.159> control<00:01:56.729> is<00:01:56.880> like<00:01:57.000> on<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.290> d7000<00:01:58.290> or

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
exposure control is like on the d7000 or

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.410 
exposure control is like on the d7000 or

speed and your aperture and get

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.080

exposure<00:02:12.670> you<00:02:12.910> want<00:02:13.150> not<00:02:13.830> monkeying<00:02:14.830> around

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
exposure you want not monkeying around

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.340 
exposure you want not monkeying around
until<00:02:16.090> the<00:02:16.180> camera<00:02:16.510> has<00:02:16.630> an<00:02:16.750> exposure<00:02:17.080> you

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
until the camera has an exposure you

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:18.930 
until the camera has an exposure you
like<00:02:17.590> and<00:02:17.800> then<00:02:17.890> locking<00:02:18.310> it<00:02:18.400> in<00:02:18.550> that's<00:02:18.790> not

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
like and then locking it in that's not

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.450 
like and then locking it in that's not
manual<00:02:19.270> exposure<00:02:19.540> control<00:02:20.080> so<00:02:20.740> that<00:02:21.040> is<00:02:21.310> the

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
manual exposure control so that is the

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.940 
manual exposure control so that is the
issue<00:02:21.610> with<00:02:22.000> the<00:02:22.090> 5100<00:02:22.810> the<00:02:22.960> 3100<00:02:23.680> has<00:02:23.800> the

issue with the 5100 the 3100 has the

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.830 
issue with the 5100 the 3100 has the
same<00:02:24.160> issue<00:02:24.400> so<00:02:25.090> no<00:02:25.330> I<00:02:25.360> wouldn't<00:02:25.720> suggest

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
same issue so no I wouldn't suggest

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.380 
same issue so no I wouldn't suggest
going<00:02:26.170> down<00:02:26.410> to<00:02:26.590> the<00:02:26.680> 3100<00:02:27.460> if<00:02:27.610> you<00:02:28.270> were

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
going down to the 3100 if you were

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.660 
going down to the 3100 if you were
considering<00:02:28.900> the<00:02:29.050> 5100<00:02:29.800> and<00:02:29.860> thought<00:02:30.130> that<00:02:30.280> 31

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
considering the 5100 and thought that 31

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.160 
considering the 5100 and thought that 31
would<00:02:30.850> solve<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.180> problem<00:02:31.209> certainly<00:02:32.020> won't

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
would solve the problem certainly won't

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.060 
would solve the problem certainly won't
either<00:02:33.070> go<00:02:33.730> with<00:02:33.820> the<00:02:33.880> 51<00:02:34.510> and<00:02:34.690> and<00:02:35.200> see<00:02:35.830> if<00:02:35.920> you

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
either go with the 51 and and see if you

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.040 
either go with the 51 and and see if you
if<00:02:36.220> you<00:02:36.340> like<00:02:36.580> the<00:02:36.790> controls<00:02:37.240> on<00:02:37.480> it<00:02:37.600> or<00:02:37.750> step

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
if you like the controls on it or step

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.290 
if you like the controls on it or step
up<00:02:38.170> to<00:02:38.290> the<00:02:38.380> 7000<00:02:39.130> or<00:02:39.430> if<00:02:39.790> you<00:02:39.880> want<00:02:40.060> a<00:02:40.090> really
