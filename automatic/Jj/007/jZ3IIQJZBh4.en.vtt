00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:04.509
 Nothing nicer in the winter than putting a delicious stew on the table. 

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:08.660
 We make a very tasteful version with chicken, tomato and mushrooms. 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:13.520
 You can also make it in advance, because it is even better the next day! 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.710
 While our chicken breast fillets are thawing, we can start cutting. 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.400
 First we chop a few onions and cloves of garlic. 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.310
 Mushrooms also always do well in stews. 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.910
 We cut it into 4. 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.000
 We first season our chicken breast fillets with black pepper and salt. 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.480
 Then we fry them in some olive oil. 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.550
 If the fillets are golden brown on all sides, they are allowed out of the stew again. 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.310
 Now it's the turn of the bacon cubes. 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:48.470
 If they are golden brown and crispy, we add the finely chopped onions and the garlic 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:49.470
 at. 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.829
 We let it bake while stirring. 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:57.219
 In the meantime, we can also add the mushrooms and stir-fry. 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:01.680
 Well, the baking is done, now it's time to let everything simmer gently. 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.810
 First we add the chicken again, together with the peeled tomatoes and the bay leaf. 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.959
 We pour everything with red wine and chicken broth. 

00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:22.979
 With some paprika and cayenne pepper we give our stew a good dose of spice. 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:29.299
 We bring it to a boil and let it simmer for 3 minutes over a low heat. 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:32.340
 VoilÃ , our stew is almost ready. 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.249
 We add a few tablespoons of black olives and let them warm up for a while. 

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:40.899
 You can possibly add some extra salt with black pepper and salt. 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:43.990
 Are your children or you not a fan of olives? 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.789
 Feel free to let them out, this stew is full of flavor anyway! 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:53.780
 There are so many things that are delicious with this recipe. 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.320
 We serve it with some French bread, but you can also opt for a southern one, for example 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.619
 couscous or for fries or croquettes. 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:08.479
 A fresh and fruity red wine, such as this Chianti Villa Sopita from Tuscany, is ideal 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.869
 in combination with this spicy stew. 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:11.869
 Tasty! 

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:12.869
