00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.549
 the highlight of the Sparkassen Münsterland 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.770
 giro as every year the finish of the 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.080
 profi rendsburg for protection and here 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.700
 could the Dutchman jos van emden 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.340
 celebrate the victory 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.760
 the second success in Münster already for 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:21.920
 the driver of the team with base already in 2007 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.930
 he ended up here from the top 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.220
 overjoyed I would'm happy 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.289
 I think the happiest man in 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.990
 But we look up first 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.059
 the start of the race, the nearly 180 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.630
 Drivers gathered to start in 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.910
 beckum 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.160
 it was enough time away from the one 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.790
 or another professional autographs 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.129
 to get 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.149
 In addition, the cycling friends got 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:47.190
 here the official team presentation 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:49.230
 the later winner, jos van emden, worked 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.469
 There was still something tense here 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.719
 Not really at the beginning 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:57.329
 the regional hopefuls fabian 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.670
 Wegmann did not comment from the start 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.039
 too optimistic about his chances at 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.530
 land for the track also just a lot 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.820
 too shallow we go on the stretch of 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:11.010
 state in beckum at just after half past eleven 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:14.280
 205 kilometers, it was for the professionals too 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.770
 complete and most of these 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.900
 kilometers passed through the circle 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.240
 warendorf the external conditions that 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.549
 is not necessarily good to see when 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.680
 difficult though one had luck with the 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.600
 sun aggravating the effect 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.159
 Wind conditions with some strong 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.950
 floors 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:33.020
 this in turn is ideal for outliers 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.069
 and at the bergwertung and stromberg 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.950
 we see an eleven-headed one 

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:39.770
 Outlier group around the time trial 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.079
 world champion tony martin with one 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.789
 light pad already on the main work 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:46.189
 the hill will rise 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:47.859
 Of course one of the highlights 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:50.569
 on the other hand rather 

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:53.359
 Munsterland flat route clear 

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:55.520
 many spectators took part in this rise 

00:01:53.359 --> 00:02:00.229
 cheer and they had their own 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.789
 own contemplation of the race we have 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.950
 Yes just saluted and applauded 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:06.349
 we were the first to think about it 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.610
 he grins painfully now or whether 

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:10.099
 He is happy that he has so many people 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.930
 Of course, that's what they stand for and applaud 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:14.299
 are other worlds you know yourself 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.299
 Chance to know how hard that is when 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:20.150
 one dives so high with 8 10 19h 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:21.849
 So for me it's insane because so 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.079
 I did not imagine that as well 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:26.930
 training goal training and so on 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:29.930
 clearly on the half of the route 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:35.450
 So below I push it already 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:36.859
 exciting and the fast italys 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.079
 past 11 

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:41.030
 Too bad so fast went is the chances 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:42.620
 On and off we went on the 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.380
 speed with a cut over 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.900
 48 kilometer the hour really strong 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.260
 on the way to the direction of Münster 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.060
 has been 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.040
 strong outlier groups, however, again 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.220
 put up to just start the floor 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.180
 had a new five-headed 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.400
 top shape is wrong without German 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.860
 Participate the five professionals one 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.939
 Dutch Belgian 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.310
 Carpool had a lot 

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:08.400
 comfortable advantage over the pursuers 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:12.620
 more than two minutes it was clear that 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.620
 the winner of this group 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.599
 This is cycling especially on flat 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.370
 I have my fellow combatants 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:25.230
 looked at and knew three guys are 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.849
 quickly but eventually came the 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.010
 instant in which I told myself 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:30.450
 Now your moment is without me 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.579
 I have given full throttle to look around 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.500
 first of all, hang on my 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.920
 but they have me go 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:41.849
 to let 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:44.159
 perfect the right tactics because so 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:45.900
 could jos van emden the applause of 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:48.870
 many spectators at the castle square 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:52.459
 really in front enjoys the moment 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.459
 the attack was chosen perfectly
