42 inches verse the 41 inches and I just
think<00:04:33.810> it's<00:04:33.990> the<00:04:34.080> way<00:04:34.320> they've<00:04:34.560> angled<00:04:34.979> it<00:04:35.100> or

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
think it's the way they've angled it or

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.219 
think it's the way they've angled it or
something<00:04:35.880> with<00:04:36.000> the<00:04:36.120> frame<00:04:36.360> but<00:04:36.660> definitely

something with the frame but definitely

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:39.020 
something with the frame but definitely
have<00:04:37.320> measured<00:04:37.680> them<00:04:37.770> three<00:04:38.010> times<00:04:38.280> and<00:04:38.699> the

have measured them three times and the

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.450 
have measured them three times and the
writer<00:04:39.270> is<00:04:39.720> just<00:04:39.960> a<00:04:40.050> little<00:04:40.380> bit<00:04:40.530> taller<00:04:40.740> the

the exact same thing that you play down
toy<00:04:47.940> rockets<00:04:48.510> the<00:04:48.900> only<00:04:49.080> thing<00:04:49.260> is<00:04:49.350> with<00:04:49.500> the

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
toy rockets the only thing is with the

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:52.919 
unlock it that you have to push in and

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:55.310 
unlock it that you have to push in and
then<00:04:53.340> live<00:04:53.699> this<00:04:54.210> one<00:04:54.419> you<00:04:54.600> just<00:04:54.810> lift<00:04:55.080> right

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
then live this one you just lift right

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.200 
then live this one you just lift right
up<00:04:55.350> so<00:04:55.740> I'm<00:04:55.800> not<00:04:55.860> sure<00:04:55.979> why<00:04:56.310> one<00:04:56.669> has<00:04:56.699> a<00:04:56.910> safety

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
up so I'm not sure why one has a safety

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:58.909 
up so I'm not sure why one has a safety
button<00:04:57.570> and<00:04:57.660> one<00:04:57.810> doesn't<00:04:58.050> but<00:04:58.320> that<00:04:58.530> is<00:04:58.740> the

00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 
button and one doesn't but that is the

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:01.250 
button and one doesn't but that is the
difference<00:04:59.250> the<00:05:00.000> fold<00:05:00.300> on<00:05:00.510> each<00:05:00.750> dollar<00:05:01.080> are

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.260 
difference the fold on each dollar are

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:02.900 
difference the fold on each dollar are
pretty<00:05:01.500> much<00:05:01.650> the<00:05:01.800> exact<00:05:02.190> same<00:05:02.280> you<00:05:02.580> do<00:05:02.669> it<00:05:02.789> the

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
pretty much the exact same you do it the

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:03.920 
pretty much the exact same you do it the
exact<00:05:03.180> same<00:05:03.210> way

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
exact same way

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.409 
exact same way
the<00:05:04.530> tighter<00:05:04.860> is<00:05:05.160> a<00:05:05.190> little<00:05:06.060> bit<00:05:06.180> bigger

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419 
the tighter is a little bit bigger

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:08.840 
the tighter is a little bit bigger
because<00:05:06.630> of<00:05:06.870> the<00:05:06.990> wheels<00:05:07.350> and<00:05:07.740> you<00:05:08.280> have<00:05:08.639> to

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:08.850 
because of the wheels and you have to

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:10.250 
because of the wheels and you have to
because<00:05:09.090> it<00:05:09.180> has<00:05:09.210> this<00:05:09.539> piece<00:05:09.840> that<00:05:10.050> sticks

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:10.260 
because it has this piece that sticks

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.560 
because it has this piece that sticks
out<00:05:10.470> up<00:05:10.740> here<00:05:11.190> and<00:05:11.370> on<00:05:12.000> the<00:05:12.120> trailer<00:05:12.360> you're

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:14.669 
going to have to put the footrest up

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:16.850 
going to have to put the footrest up
with<00:05:14.970> a<00:05:15.000> handlebar<00:05:15.449> up<00:05:15.690> and<00:05:15.990> set<00:05:16.350> up<00:05:16.470> down<00:05:16.650> so

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
with a handlebar up and set up down so

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.920 
with a handlebar up and set up down so
this<00:05:16.949> one's<00:05:17.130> a<00:05:17.220> tiny<00:05:17.550> bit<00:05:17.940> more<00:05:17.970> compact<00:05:18.660> but

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
this one's a tiny bit more compact but

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.080 
this one's a tiny bit more compact but
not<00:05:19.470> that<00:05:19.650> big<00:05:19.800> a<00:05:19.860> deal<00:05:20.039> I<00:05:20.160> mean<00:05:20.310> you<00:05:20.430> could<00:05:20.729> put

not that big a deal I mean you could put

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.790 
not that big a deal I mean you could put
that<00:05:21.660> one<00:05:21.840> down<00:05:22.050> like<00:05:22.380> that<00:05:22.650> and<00:05:23.160> then<00:05:24.800> like

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 
that one down like that and then like

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.040 
that one down like that and then like
that<00:05:26.130> but<00:05:26.400> like<00:05:26.520> I<00:05:26.610> said<00:05:26.820> just<00:05:26.849> a<00:05:27.180> tiny<00:05:27.690> bit

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
that but like I said just a tiny bit

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.140 
that but like I said just a tiny bit
bigger<00:05:28.229> on<00:05:28.380> the<00:05:28.500> trailer<00:05:28.710> but<00:05:28.800> nothing<00:05:29.550> that's

bigger on the trailer but nothing that's
going<00:05:30.720> to<00:05:30.810> make<00:05:30.960> too<00:05:31.110> much<00:05:31.200> of<00:05:31.260> a<00:05:31.380> difference

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
going to make too much of a difference

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.560 
going to make too much of a difference

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:12.240 
you're basically $40 difference for the

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.670 
you're basically $40 difference for the
fact<00:06:12.419> that<00:06:12.479> you<00:06:12.690> get<00:06:12.870> the<00:06:13.050> bigger<00:06:13.289> wheels

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:13.680

fact that you get the bigger wheels
they're<00:06:14.639> going<00:06:14.820> to<00:06:14.880> be<00:06:14.940> better<00:06:15.120> on<00:06:15.270> all

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:15.479 
they're going to be better on all

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:17.629 
they're going to be better on all
terrain<00:06:15.780> so<00:06:16.320> it's<00:06:16.500> got<00:06:16.650> to<00:06:16.740> come<00:06:16.949> down<00:06:16.979> to<00:06:17.430> are

00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:17.639 
terrain so it's got to come down to are

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:20.839 
terrain so it's got to come down to are
you<00:06:17.699> a<00:06:18.060> sporty<00:06:18.750> parent<00:06:19.139> or<00:06:19.770> you<00:06:20.099> an<00:06:20.280> extra

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:23.250 
sporty parent maybe jogging is totally

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:24.830 
sporty parent maybe jogging is totally
not<00:06:23.430> your<00:06:23.460> thing<00:06:23.880> you<00:06:23.909> don't<00:06:24.210> care<00:06:24.419> about<00:06:24.539> that

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:24.840 
not your thing you don't care about that

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.159 
not your thing you don't care about that
then<00:06:25.349> I

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:26.169 
then I

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:28.140 
then I
with<00:06:26.289> the<00:06:26.409> writer<00:06:26.620> but<00:06:27.249> if<00:06:27.460> you<00:06:27.610> want<00:06:27.849> a<00:06:27.909> light

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:28.150 
with the writer but if you want a light

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.179 
with the writer but if you want a light
jog<00:06:28.509> or<00:06:28.870> you<00:06:29.020> know<00:06:29.110> go<00:06:29.349> on<00:06:29.469> some<00:06:29.710> trails

00:06:30.179 --> 00:06:30.189 
jog or you know go on some trails

00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:32.429 
jog or you know go on some trails
maybe<00:06:30.639> the<00:06:31.210> trailer<00:06:31.479> is<00:06:31.689> better<00:06:31.900> for<00:06:32.139> you<00:06:32.289> so

00:06:32.429 --> 00:06:32.439 
maybe the trailer is better for you so

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:35.429 
maybe the trailer is better for you so
again<00:06:32.740> definitely<00:06:33.360> very<00:06:34.360> similar<00:06:34.870> features

00:06:35.429 --> 00:06:35.439 
again definitely very similar features

00:06:35.439 --> 00:06:37.379 
again definitely very similar features
you<00:06:36.039> know<00:06:36.159> things<00:06:36.460> are<00:06:36.550> off<00:06:36.729> a<00:06:36.759> little<00:06:37.270> bit

00:06:37.379 --> 00:06:37.389 
you know things are off a little bit

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:38.820 
you know things are off a little bit
here<00:06:37.659> and<00:06:37.749> there<00:06:38.020> so<00:06:38.229> they're<00:06:38.349> not<00:06:38.439> the<00:06:38.620> same

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:38.830 
here and there so they're not the same
