00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
back panel next to the mid boost is the

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.130 
back panel next to the mid boost is the
channel<00:01:11.250> changer<00:01:11.640> itself<00:01:12.030> from<00:01:12.240> clean<00:01:12.540> to

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
channel changer itself from clean to

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.710 
channel changer itself from clean to
overdrive<00:01:13.590> high<00:01:13.979> gain<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.520> then<00:01:15.270> these<00:01:15.509> are

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
overdrive high gain and then these are

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.359 
overdrive high gain and then these are
our<00:01:15.840> two<00:01:16.080> master<00:01:16.530> volumes<00:01:16.979> for<00:01:17.159> both

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
our two master volumes for both

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.910 
our two master volumes for both
different<00:01:17.640> channels<00:01:18.180> master<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:19.020> B<00:01:19.259> right

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
different channels master a and B right

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.249 
different channels master a and B right
now<00:01:19.979> we're<00:01:20.310> on<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.430> clean<00:01:20.790> channel<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.540> then

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
now we're on the clean channel and then

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.480 
now we're on the clean channel and then
that's<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.310> dirty<00:01:23.549> channel<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:24.030> master<00:01:24.420> B<00:01:24.630> and

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
that's the dirty channel to master B and

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.730 
that's the dirty channel to master B and
then<00:01:26.490> next<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.820> that<00:01:26.939> is<00:01:27.150> our<00:01:27.270> presence<00:01:27.750> okay

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
then next to that is our presence okay

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.590 
then next to that is our presence okay
so<00:01:28.799> those<00:01:29.070> are<00:01:29.220> all<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.430> knobs<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:30.000> then<00:01:30.240> this

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
so those are all the knobs and then this

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.200 
so those are all the knobs and then this
this<00:01:31.079> is<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.259> really<00:01:31.560> awesome<00:01:31.590> system<00:01:32.400> this<00:01:32.970> is

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
this is a really awesome system this is

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.719 
this is a really awesome system this is
the<00:01:33.240> power<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.720> monitor<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:34.710> this<00:01:35.280> will<00:01:35.549> let

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
the power to monitor and this will let

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.429 
the power to monitor and this will let
you<00:01:35.880> know<00:01:35.909> when<00:01:36.420> one<00:01:36.600> of<00:01:36.689> your<00:01:36.780> power<00:01:37.020> tubes

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
you know when one of your power tubes

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.429 
you know when one of your power tubes
isn't<00:01:38.400> feeling<00:01:38.640> so<00:01:38.759> good<00:01:39.180> okay<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.259> then<00:01:40.350> next

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
isn't feeling so good okay and then next

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.010 
isn't feeling so good okay and then next
to<00:01:40.619> that<00:01:40.650> obviously<00:01:41.070> is<00:01:41.700> our<00:01:41.820> standby<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.780> our

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
to that obviously is our standby and our

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:50.300 
to that obviously is our standby and our
power<00:01:43.290> switch<00:01:43.710> first<00:01:44.040> up<00:01:44.369> clean

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310

me

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.890 

second<00:02:02.440> up<00:02:02.560> we<00:02:02.920> have<00:02:03.070> our<00:02:03.220> gain<00:02:03.490> jacked<00:02:04.090> we're

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900 
second up we have our gain jacked we're

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.870 
second up we have our gain jacked we're
going<00:02:05.020> to<00:02:05.080> engage<00:02:05.259> the<00:02:05.710> mid<00:02:05.950> boost<00:02:06.159> button<00:02:06.549> and
