00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:27.820 
he does give it when you do give up a

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.100 
he does give it when you do give up a
chance<00:00:28.000> and<00:00:28.180> he<00:00:28.240> does<00:00:28.390> get<00:00:28.510> in<00:00:28.660> on<00:00:28.779> goal<00:00:28.990> he's

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:29.110 
chance and he does get in on goal he's

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:30.570 
chance and he does get in on goal he's
gonna<00:00:29.260> he's<00:00:29.680> going<00:00:29.830> to<00:00:29.890> take<00:00:30.039> the<00:00:30.160> chance<00:00:30.340> more

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:30.580 
gonna he's going to take the chance more

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.279 
gonna he's going to take the chance more
often<00:00:30.820> than<00:00:30.940> not<00:00:31.000> which<00:00:31.510> obviously<00:00:31.840> makes<00:00:32.079> for

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:32.289 
often than not which obviously makes for

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:34.080 
often than not which obviously makes for
more<00:00:32.439> challenging<00:00:33.100> experience<00:00:33.640> and<00:00:33.879> at<00:00:34.000> the

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.090 
more challenging experience and at the

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:35.970 
more challenging experience and at the
higher<00:00:34.270> levels<00:00:34.629> obviously<00:00:35.320> you<00:00:35.680> really<00:00:35.859> got

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
higher levels obviously you really got

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:36.990 
higher levels obviously you really got
to<00:00:36.070> be<00:00:36.129> on<00:00:36.160> your<00:00:36.250> guard<00:00:36.489> to<00:00:36.670> make<00:00:36.789> sure<00:00:36.879> you're

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.000 
to be on your guard to make sure you're

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.189 
to be on your guard to make sure you're
not<00:00:37.059> giving<00:00:37.329> up<00:00:37.420> good<00:00:37.570> chances<00:00:37.930> and<00:00:38.109> cpu<00:00:43.199> as

00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:44.199 
not giving up good chances and cpu as

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:45.719 
not giving up good chances and cpu as
for<00:00:44.469> some<00:00:44.620> new<00:00:44.829> things<00:00:45.159> that<00:00:45.370> I<00:00:45.429> think<00:00:45.489> we're

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:45.729 
for some new things that I think we're

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:47.489 
for some new things that I think we're
adding<00:00:46.030> I<00:00:46.420> think<00:00:46.809> we're<00:00:46.929> innovating<00:00:47.229> on<00:00:47.409> the

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:47.499 
adding I think we're innovating on the

00:00:47.499 --> 00:00:49.979 
adding I think we're innovating on the
cpu<00:00:47.829> I<00:00:47.889> in<00:00:47.979> a<00:00:48.039> couple<00:00:48.339> ways<00:00:48.719> one<00:00:49.719> of<00:00:49.839> them<00:00:49.960> is

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989 
cpu I in a couple ways one of them is

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:52.910 
cpu I in a couple ways one of them is
really<00:00:50.620> cool<00:00:50.799> to<00:00:51.010> me<00:00:51.129> I've<00:00:51.460> always<00:00:51.999> liked

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
really cool to me I've always liked

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.899 
really cool to me I've always liked
possession<00:00:53.920> football<00:00:54.280> I'm<00:00:54.399> an<00:00:54.489> arsenal<00:00:54.879> fan

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:57.819 
so so when I when I play the game and

00:00:57.819 --> 00:01:00.509 
so so when I when I play the game and
I'm<00:00:57.879> playing<00:00:57.909> against<00:00:58.239> the<00:00:58.329> cpu<00:00:58.679> in<00:00:59.679> times

00:01:00.509 --> 00:01:00.519 
I'm playing against the cpu in times

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:03.149 
I'm playing against the cpu in times
past<00:01:00.670> in<00:01:01.120> previous<00:01:01.690> years<00:01:01.719> it<00:01:02.379> was<00:01:02.559> very<00:01:02.769> very

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:03.159 
past in previous years it was very very

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:05.070 
past in previous years it was very very
attacking<00:01:03.879> mine<00:01:04.150> it<00:01:04.330> would<00:01:04.510> get<00:01:04.629> forward<00:01:04.989> all

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
attacking mine it would get forward all

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.450 
attacking mine it would get forward all
the<00:01:05.110> time<00:01:05.350> but<00:01:05.470> he<00:01:05.560> wasn't<00:01:05.710> always<00:01:05.890> as<00:01:06.070> patient

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
the time but he wasn't always as patient

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.190 
the time but he wasn't always as patient
as<00:01:06.549> we<00:01:06.640> would<00:01:06.760> like<00:01:06.790> so<00:01:07.420> we've<00:01:07.600> implemented

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
as we would like so we've implemented

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.450 
as we would like so we've implemented
some<00:01:08.440> features<00:01:08.770> about<00:01:08.860> keeping<00:01:09.280> possession

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
some features about keeping possession

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.430 
some features about keeping possession
this<00:01:09.909> year<00:01:10.120> so<00:01:10.300> that<00:01:10.660> he's<00:01:10.810> a<00:01:10.840> little<00:01:11.320> more

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
this year so that he's a little more

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.930 
this year so that he's a little more
calm<00:01:11.680> depending<00:01:12.160> especially<00:01:12.520> depending<00:01:12.640> on

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:12.940 
calm depending especially depending on

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.340 
calm depending especially depending on
the<00:01:13.000> custom<00:01:13.330> tactics<00:01:13.750> that<00:01:13.810> you<00:01:13.960> set<00:01:14.140> up<00:01:14.260> but

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
the custom tactics that you set up but

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.170 
the custom tactics that you set up but

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
if you have a possession style fee he's

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.310 
if you have a possession style fee he's
a<00:01:16.210> little<00:01:16.360> more<00:01:16.480> calm<00:01:16.690> on<00:01:16.900> the<00:01:16.960> ball<00:01:17.140> and

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
a little more calm on the ball and

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.080 
a little more calm on the ball and
willing<00:01:17.530> to<00:01:17.620> wait<00:01:17.800> for<00:01:18.010> his<00:01:18.130> opportunity<00:01:18.700> so

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
willing to wait for his opportunity so

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.640 
willing to wait for his opportunity so
you<00:01:19.150> quite<00:01:19.420> often<00:01:19.660> see<00:01:20.020> him<00:01:20.200> swinging<00:01:20.500> the

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:20.650 
you quite often see him swinging the

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.590 
you quite often see him swinging the

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
ball around the back line teasing it

plays in the different leagues so you

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:33.660 
plays in the different leagues so you
get<00:01:32.590> a<00:01:32.620> lot<00:01:32.770> of<00:01:32.800> variety<00:01:33.250> when<00:01:33.400> you're<00:01:33.520> playing

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
get a lot of variety when you're playing

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:39.050 
get a lot of variety when you're playing
different<00:01:33.850> opponents

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.190 

personality<00:01:40.060> plus<00:01:40.270> is<00:01:40.479> one<00:01:40.630> of<00:01:40.720> our<00:01:40.810> big

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
personality plus is one of our big

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.510 
personality plus is one of our big
features<00:01:41.590> this<00:01:41.740> year<00:01:41.950> we're<00:01:42.190> trying<00:01:42.400> to

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
features this year we're trying to

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.250 
features this year we're trying to
really<00:01:42.940> work<00:01:43.240> hard<00:01:43.300> on<00:01:43.540> the<00:01:43.630> attributes<00:01:44.110> and

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:44.260 
really work hard on the attributes and

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.140 
really work hard on the attributes and
make<00:01:44.440> players<00:01:44.650> feel<00:01:45.550> like<00:01:45.729> their<00:01:45.880> real<00:01:46.030> life

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
make players feel like their real life

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.000 
make players feel like their real life
counterparts<00:01:46.210> so<00:01:46.960> this<00:01:47.350> is<00:01:47.500> really<00:01:47.620> cool<00:01:47.830> for

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.010 
counterparts so this is really cool for

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.370 
counterparts so this is really cool for
us<00:01:48.040> on<00:01:48.220> the<00:01:48.310> cpu<00:01:48.700> your<00:01:49.240> cpu<00:01:49.600> AI<00:01:49.750> side<00:01:50.110> of<00:01:50.260> things

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
us on the cpu your cpu AI side of things

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.260 
us on the cpu your cpu AI side of things
because<00:01:50.800> when<00:01:51.580> you're<00:01:51.700> playing<00:01:51.880> against<00:01:52.150> the

because when you're playing against the

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.300 
because when you're playing against the
cpu<00:01:52.450> better<00:01:52.930> dribblers<00:01:53.380> will<00:01:53.650> do<00:01:53.770> more<00:01:53.979> trying

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
cpu better dribblers will do more trying

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.450 
cpu better dribblers will do more trying
to<00:01:54.340> take<00:01:54.520> you<00:01:54.670> on<00:01:54.750> we<00:01:55.750> had<00:01:55.840> a<00:01:55.869> feature<00:01:56.110> or<00:01:56.650> one

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
to take you on we had a feature or one

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.580 
to take you on we had a feature or one
of<00:01:57.490> the<00:01:57.670> decisions<00:01:58.330> that<00:01:58.390> the<00:01:58.509> CPU<00:01:58.900> has<00:01:59.200> to

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
of the decisions that the CPU has to

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.920 
of the decisions that the CPU has to
make<00:01:59.710> is<00:01:59.860> whether<00:02:00.190> or<00:02:00.430> not<00:02:00.520> I'm<00:02:00.670> safe<00:02:00.970> so<00:02:01.630> as

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 
make is whether or not I'm safe so as

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.900 
make is whether or not I'm safe so as
he's<00:02:02.680> dribbling<00:02:02.890> around<00:02:03.130> the<00:02:03.369> pitch<00:02:03.550> he<00:02:03.729> needs

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:03.910 
he's dribbling around the pitch he needs

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.249 
he's dribbling around the pitch he needs

continue to dribble do I turn away and

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:09.840 
continue to dribble do I turn away and
one<00:02:08.860> of<00:02:08.950> the<00:02:09.009> ways<00:02:09.039> he<00:02:09.160> does<00:02:09.369> this<00:02:09.520> is<00:02:09.640> he<00:02:09.729> has

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
one of the ways he does this is he has

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:11.699 
one of the ways he does this is he has
something<00:02:10.149> that<00:02:10.270> we<00:02:10.390> call<00:02:10.570> a<00:02:10.630> safe<00:02:10.929> zone<00:02:10.959> where

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
something that we call a safe zone where

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.400 
something that we call a safe zone where
as<00:02:11.920> an<00:02:12.670> opponent<00:02:12.940> an<00:02:13.330> opponent<00:02:14.020> will<00:02:14.110> approach

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
as an opponent an opponent will approach

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:15.690 
as an opponent an opponent will approach
him<00:02:14.650> he'll<00:02:14.860> determine<00:02:15.310> whether<00:02:15.459> he's

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
him he'll determine whether he's

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.330 
him he'll determine whether he's
becoming<00:02:16.570> safe<00:02:16.810> or<00:02:16.989> not<00:02:17.050> and<00:02:17.290> this<00:02:17.770> logic<00:02:18.190> in

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
becoming safe or not and this logic in

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.220 
becoming safe or not and this logic in
past<00:02:18.940> years<00:02:19.090> has<00:02:19.300> been<00:02:19.420> very<00:02:19.660> generic<00:02:20.080> so

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
past years has been very generic so

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.660 
past years has been very generic so
everybody<00:02:20.590> safe<00:02:20.860> someone<00:02:21.160> was<00:02:21.250> relatively

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
everybody safe someone was relatively

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.729 
everybody safe someone was relatively
similar<00:02:21.970> this<00:02:22.780> meant<00:02:22.989> that<00:02:23.080> it<00:02:23.530> didn't<00:02:23.709> matter

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
similar this meant that it didn't matter

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:25.320 
similar this meant that it didn't matter
if<00:02:23.950> you<00:02:24.010> I<00:02:24.040> Cristiano<00:02:24.489> Ronaldo<00:02:24.940> on<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.150> ball

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
if you I Cristiano Ronaldo on the ball

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.990 
if you I Cristiano Ronaldo on the ball
or<00:02:25.690> messy<00:02:26.020> on<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.260> ball<00:02:26.440> versus<00:02:27.130> Rio

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
or messy on the ball versus Rio

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.910 
or messy on the ball versus Rio
Ferdinand<00:02:28.540> or<00:02:28.810> richard<00:02:29.260> donner's<00:02:29.680> are

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
Ferdinand or richard donner's are

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.530 
Ferdinand or richard donner's are
somebody<00:02:30.459> that<00:02:30.640> really<00:02:31.060> wouldn't<00:02:31.330> try<00:02:31.510> and

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
somebody that really wouldn't try and

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.270 
somebody that really wouldn't try and
take<00:02:31.750> somebody<00:02:32.110> off<00:02:32.140> but<00:02:32.709> this<00:02:32.890> year<00:02:33.070> were

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
take somebody off but this year were

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.130 
take somebody off but this year were
dynamically<00:02:34.090> changing<00:02:34.600> the<00:02:34.690> size<00:02:34.930> of<00:02:35.110> that

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
dynamically changing the size of that

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.440 
dynamically changing the size of that
safe<00:02:35.500> zone<00:02:35.800> based<00:02:36.370> on<00:02:36.610> the<00:02:36.670> players<00:02:36.910> attribute

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
safe zone based on the players attribute

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.390 
safe zone based on the players attribute
so<00:02:37.870> players<00:02:38.110> like<00:02:38.320> Messi<00:02:38.739> and<00:02:38.769> Cristiano

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
so players like Messi and Cristiano

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.280 
so players like Messi and Cristiano
Ronaldo<00:02:40.090> will<00:02:40.330> still<00:02:40.630> try<00:02:40.780> and<00:02:40.840> dribble<00:02:41.230> out

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
Ronaldo will still try and dribble out

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.930 
Ronaldo will still try and dribble out
of<00:02:41.440> tight<00:02:41.590> situations<00:02:41.830> like<00:02:42.400> they<00:02:42.549> do<00:02:42.610> in<00:02:42.760> the

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
of tight situations like they do in the

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.430 
of tight situations like they do in the
real<00:02:43.060> world<00:02:43.330> so<00:02:43.780> it's<00:02:43.930> cool<00:02:43.989> it<00:02:44.260> brings

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
real world so it's cool it brings

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.620 
real world so it's cool it brings
another<00:02:44.760> little<00:02:45.760> bit<00:02:45.880> of<00:02:45.970> character<00:02:46.269> to<00:02:46.420> the

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
another little bit of character to the

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.120 
another little bit of character to the
CPU<00:02:46.989> AI<00:02:47.110> when<00:02:47.380> you're<00:02:47.500> playing<00:02:47.650> against<00:02:47.950> them

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
CPU AI when you're playing against them

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.710 
CPU AI when you're playing against them
and<00:02:48.280> these<00:02:48.580> guys<00:02:48.760> might<00:02:49.000> try<00:02:49.150> and<00:02:49.209> take<00:02:49.390> you<00:02:49.570> on

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
and these guys might try and take you on

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:50.910 
and these guys might try and take you on
and<00:02:49.900> you<00:02:49.959> might<00:02:50.110> be<00:02:50.140> a<00:02:50.260> little<00:02:50.320> bit<00:02:50.560> surprised

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
and you might be a little bit surprised

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.620 
and you might be a little bit surprised
of<00:02:51.070> what<00:02:51.100> they<00:02:51.280> can<00:02:51.430> do<00:02:51.549> so<00:02:51.850> it's<00:02:52.299> quite<00:02:52.480> cool

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
of what they can do so it's quite cool

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:53.699 
of what they can do so it's quite cool
when<00:02:52.810> you're<00:02:52.900> playing<00:02:53.049> against<00:02:53.290> a<00:02:53.350> seafood

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
when you're playing against a seafood

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.340 
when you're playing against a seafood
sometimes<00:02:54.400> it's<00:02:54.579> a<00:02:54.670> little<00:02:54.700> bit<00:02:55.060> humbling<00:02:55.959> yes

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
sometimes it's a little bit humbling yes

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:57.990 
sometimes it's a little bit humbling yes
so<00:02:56.739> I'm<00:02:57.010> quite<00:02:57.160> excited<00:02:57.310> about<00:02:57.579> that<00:02:57.820> feature

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
so I'm quite excited about that feature

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.390
