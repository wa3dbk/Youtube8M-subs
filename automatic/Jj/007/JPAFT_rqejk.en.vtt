00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.690 
opinion how important would you say
accuracy<00:01:31.200> is<00:01:31.320> in<00:01:31.440> cosplay<00:01:31.890> I<00:01:32.100> think<00:01:32.370> if<00:01:32.490> you're

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
accuracy is in cosplay I think if you're

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.970 
accuracy is in cosplay I think if you're
crying<00:01:33.090> that's<00:01:33.810> what<00:01:33.990> really<00:01:34.140> matters<00:01:34.650> but

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:34.980 
crying that's what really matters but

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.380 
crying that's what really matters but
accuracy<00:01:35.460> of<00:01:35.730> chords<00:01:36.000> are<00:01:36.090> going<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.300> give

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
accuracy of chords are going to give

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.630 
accuracy of chords are going to give
more<00:01:36.630> depth<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.050> character<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.950> obviously

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
more depth to character and obviously

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.920 
more depth to character and obviously
it'll<00:01:38.850> be<00:01:38.970> able<00:01:39.120> to<00:01:39.180> tell<00:01:39.360> who<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.630> character

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
it'll be able to tell who the character

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.050 
it'll be able to tell who the character
is<00:01:39.960> better<00:01:40.290> you<00:01:40.500> really<00:01:40.710> think

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
is better you really think

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.139 
is better you really think
just<00:01:41.270> about<00:01:41.479> having<00:01:41.780> fun<00:01:41.990> and<00:01:42.049> doing<00:01:42.759> but<00:01:43.759> it

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
just about having fun and doing but it

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:45.969 
just about having fun and doing but it
can<00:01:44.360> be<00:01:44.450> pretty<00:01:44.630> important<00:01:45.140> sometime<00:01:45.560> it

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
can be pretty important sometime it

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:47.530 
can be pretty important sometime it
depends<00:01:46.460> on<00:01:46.520> the<00:01:46.640> kind<00:01:46.759> of<00:01:46.850> accuracy<00:01:47.270> you're

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
depends on the kind of accuracy you're

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.870 
depends on the kind of accuracy you're
going<00:01:47.840> for<00:01:48.020> whether<00:01:48.170> it's<00:01:48.409> green<00:01:48.829> or<00:01:49.100> realism

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880
