00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
thing I filled up this whole area the

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.379 
thing I filled up this whole area the
farmland<00:02:25.170> this<00:02:25.769> is<00:02:26.010> expanded<00:02:26.819> quite<00:02:27.000> a<00:02:27.090> lot

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:27.389 
farmland this is expanded quite a lot

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:31.160 
farmland this is expanded quite a lot
and<00:02:28.340> you<00:02:29.340> can<00:02:29.489> see<00:02:29.639> I've<00:02:29.819> had<00:02:30.540> to<00:02:30.660> build<00:02:30.870> some

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
and you can see I've had to build some

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.900 
and you can see I've had to build some
city<00:02:31.410> over<00:02:31.739> here<00:02:31.980> I<00:02:32.220> should<00:02:32.579> have<00:02:32.700> planned

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
city over here I should have planned

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.699 
city over here I should have planned
more<00:02:33.209> ahead<00:02:33.510> and<00:02:33.720> built<00:02:33.870> it<00:02:34.019> down<00:02:34.200> here<00:02:34.500> but

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
more ahead and built it down here but

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.849 
more ahead and built it down here but
yeah<00:02:35.400> whatever<00:02:36.030> so<00:02:36.870> I'll<00:02:36.959> be<00:02:37.079> building<00:02:37.500> farms

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:37.859 
yeah whatever so I'll be building farms

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:39.800 
yeah whatever so I'll be building farms
around<00:02:38.010> here<00:02:38.250> the<00:02:38.549> problem<00:02:38.849> I've<00:02:39.239> got<00:02:39.269> is

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
around here the problem I've got is

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.080 
around here the problem I've got is
industries<00:02:40.709> pollution<00:02:41.310> now<00:02:41.430> fills<00:02:41.700> in<00:02:41.880> this

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
industries pollution now fills in this

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.000 
industries pollution now fills in this
so<00:02:42.269> anything<00:02:42.750> above<00:02:42.870> this<00:02:43.260> line<00:02:43.530> is<00:02:43.590> going<00:02:43.950> to

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
so anything above this line is going to

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.319 
so anything above this line is going to
probably<00:02:44.609> fail<00:02:46.459> and<00:02:47.459> if<00:02:47.639> we<00:02:47.790> come<00:02:47.970> down<00:02:48.000> here

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.329 
probably fail and if we come down here

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:50.150 
probably fail and if we come down here
you<00:02:48.450> can<00:02:48.599> see<00:02:48.810> these<00:02:48.989> are<00:02:49.049> the<00:02:49.319> homes<00:02:49.620> you<00:02:49.889> saw

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
you can see these are the homes you saw

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.330 
you can see these are the homes you saw
before<00:02:50.370> with<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.349> low<00:02:52.349> density<00:02:52.889> medium

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
before with the low density medium

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.030 
before with the low density medium
density<00:02:53.720> well<00:02:54.720> I'd<00:02:54.989> started<00:02:55.590> building<00:02:55.919> these

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
density well I'd started building these

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.550 
density well I'd started building these
high<00:02:56.370> dense<00:02:56.669> areas<00:02:57.120> these<00:02:57.299> are<00:02:57.480> all<00:02:57.599> qualified

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
high dense areas these are all qualified

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.530 
high dense areas these are all qualified
workers<00:02:59.000> and<00:03:01.340> if<00:03:02.340> we<00:03:02.579> come<00:03:02.819> back<00:03:03.000> over<00:03:03.329> to<00:03:03.450> the

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
workers and if we come back over to the

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.069 
workers and if we come back over to the
main<00:03:03.750> portion<00:03:04.290> of<00:03:04.380> the<00:03:04.530> city<00:03:04.799> I<00:03:06.079> started

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
playing with the freeform tool and it I

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:12.289 
playing with the freeform tool and it I
didn't<00:03:11.069> design<00:03:11.340> this<00:03:11.519> neighborhood<00:03:11.970> I<00:03:12.000> just

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
didn't design this neighborhood I just

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.000

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
expensive expressway you can see why

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.690 
expensive expressway you can see why
right<00:04:31.180> here<00:04:31.480> that's<00:04:32.020> three<00:04:32.470> lanes<00:04:32.710> just<00:04:33.190> one

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:33.700 
right here that's three lanes just one

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.170 
right here that's three lanes just one
direction's<00:04:34.300> solid<00:04:34.780> backup<00:04:35.050> of<00:04:35.410> cars<00:04:36.180> which

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
direction's solid backup of cars which

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.700 
direction's solid backup of cars which
is<00:04:37.330> a<00:04:37.360> pretty<00:04:37.630> heavy<00:04:37.900> traffic<00:04:39.810> this<00:04:40.810> road<00:04:41.169> here

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
is a pretty heavy traffic this road here

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.610 
is a pretty heavy traffic this road here
is<00:04:41.890> the<00:04:42.520> most<00:04:42.669> traffic<00:04:43.120> erode<00:04:43.660> next<00:04:44.320> to<00:04:44.440> this

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
is the most traffic erode next to this

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.010 
is the most traffic erode next to this
one<00:04:44.890> which<00:04:45.700> will<00:04:45.880> show<00:04:46.060> in<00:04:46.210> a<00:04:46.270> second<00:04:46.690> but<00:04:46.810> I

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
one which will show in a second but I

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.960 
one which will show in a second but I
didn't<00:04:47.530> plan<00:04:47.740> ahead<00:04:47.950> enough<00:04:48.460> and<00:04:48.700> so<00:04:48.850> this

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
didn't plan ahead enough and so this

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.360 
didn't plan ahead enough and so this
road<00:04:49.180> is<00:04:49.330> so<00:04:49.510> busy<00:04:49.780> that<00:04:50.080> I<00:04:50.350> can't<00:04:51.100> do<00:04:51.220> anything

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
road is so busy that I can't do anything

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.580 
road is so busy that I can't do anything
over<00:04:51.820> here<00:04:51.940> so<00:04:52.090> I<00:04:52.120> made<00:04:52.330> it<00:04:52.480> one<00:04:52.750> direction<00:04:53.440> and

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
over here so I made it one direction and

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.320 
over here so I made it one direction and
built<00:04:53.800> this<00:04:53.980> kind<00:04:54.250> of<00:04:54.310> bypass<00:04:54.760> around<00:04:55.000> the

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
built this kind of bypass around the

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.920 
built this kind of bypass around the
area<00:04:55.690> for<00:04:56.050> it<00:04:56.169> I<00:04:56.730> built<00:04:57.730> the<00:04:57.850> expressway<00:04:58.450> here

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
area for it I built the expressway here

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.200 
area for it I built the expressway here
as<00:04:59.080> well<00:04:59.530> it<00:04:59.860> connects<00:05:00.220> out<00:05:00.430> of<00:05:00.580> the<00:05:00.730> city<00:05:00.970> to

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
as well it connects out of the city to

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.210 
as well it connects out of the city to
alleviate<00:05:02.080> some<00:05:02.290> the<00:05:02.380> traffic<00:05:02.740> problems<00:05:03.100> on

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
alleviate some the traffic problems on

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.820 
alleviate some the traffic problems on
these<00:05:03.370> main<00:05:03.610> roads<00:05:03.910> and<00:05:04.240> I<00:05:05.080> beefed<00:05:05.380> up<00:05:05.590> the

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
these main roads and I beefed up the

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.740 
these main roads and I beefed up the
side<00:05:06.190> road<00:05:06.460> here<00:05:06.700> to<00:05:06.820> connect<00:05:07.150> the<00:05:07.270> people<00:05:07.570> for

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 
side road here to connect the people for

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.900 
side road here to connect the people for
jobs<00:05:08.160> over<00:05:09.160> here<00:05:09.370> you<00:05:09.490> can<00:05:09.640> see<00:05:09.790> I<00:05:09.820> brought

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
jobs over here you can see I brought

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.760 
jobs over here you can see I brought
another<00:05:10.330> bridge<00:05:10.600> over<00:05:10.990> and<00:05:11.169> I'll<00:05:11.530> show<00:05:11.740> you

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 
another bridge over and I'll show you

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.640 
another bridge over and I'll show you
why<00:05:12.210> as<00:05:13.210> you<00:05:13.360> can<00:05:13.450> see<00:05:13.660> my<00:05:13.810> traffic<00:05:14.350> over<00:05:14.620> here

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
why as you can see my traffic over here

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.550 
why as you can see my traffic over here
is<00:05:15.070> just<00:05:15.370> horrendous<00:05:15.640> as<00:05:16.330> the<00:05:16.570> two<00:05:16.750> two<00:05:17.200> areas

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
is just horrendous as the two two areas

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.070 
is just horrendous as the two two areas
connect<00:05:17.980> some<00:05:18.280> going<00:05:18.460> out<00:05:18.669> there<00:05:18.940> so<00:05:19.870> when

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
connect some going out there so when

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.560 
connect some going out there so when
we're<00:05:20.290> here<00:05:20.669> you<00:05:21.669> can<00:05:21.820> see<00:05:21.970> even<00:05:22.210> with<00:05:22.450> the

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:22.570 
we're here you can see even with the

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:24.480 
we're here you can see even with the
expressway<00:05:23.230> the<00:05:23.350> heavy<00:05:23.560> traffic<00:05:24.010> in<00:05:24.370> this

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 
expressway the heavy traffic in this

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:25.140 
expressway the heavy traffic in this
area

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
area

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.570 
area
and<00:05:25.780> it<00:05:25.930> just<00:05:26.110> kind<00:05:26.290> of<00:05:26.320> dies<00:05:26.680> down<00:05:27.010> over<00:05:27.310> here

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
and it just kind of dies down over here

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.550 
and it just kind of dies down over here
but<00:05:28.450> there's<00:05:28.720> a<00:05:28.780> lot<00:05:28.930> of<00:05:28.960> people<00:05:29.170> coming<00:05:29.530> down

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560

around here and then out on that side
and<00:05:43.300> I'll<00:05:43.600> connect<00:05:43.960> it<00:05:44.080> over<00:05:44.290> here<00:05:44.470> to<00:05:44.590> beef

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.250 
and I'll connect it over here to beef

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.690 
and I'll connect it over here to beef
that<00:05:45.460> up<00:05:45.520> a<00:05:45.790> lot<00:05:46.470> you<00:05:47.470> can<00:05:47.590> see<00:05:47.800> how<00:05:47.980> horribly

existing<00:06:09.280> Road<00:06:09.870> wasn't<00:06:10.870> molding<00:06:11.530> properly

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:12.130 
existing Road wasn't molding properly

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:14.010 
existing Road wasn't molding properly
with<00:06:12.310> this<00:06:12.550> one<00:06:12.790> and<00:06:12.970> it's<00:06:13.120> the<00:06:13.420> first<00:06:13.450> glitch

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:14.020 
with this one and it's the first glitch

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:17.880 
with this one and it's the first glitch
i<00:06:14.200> really<00:06:14.500> found<00:06:14.710> with<00:06:15.100> the<00:06:15.130> game<00:06:15.610> so<00:06:16.450> far<00:06:16.890> the

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:17.890 
i really found with the game so far the

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:20.160 
i really found with the game so far the
problem<00:06:18.250> was<00:06:18.400> these<00:06:18.760> lanes<00:06:19.150> extended<00:06:19.900> into

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:20.170 
problem was these lanes extended into

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:23.640 
problem was these lanes extended into
about<00:06:20.440> here<00:06:20.800> because<00:06:22.170> placement<00:06:23.170> of<00:06:23.320> this

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:23.650 
about here because placement of this

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.540 
about here because placement of this
Avenue<00:06:24.450> didn't<00:06:25.450> properly<00:06:26.070> overlay<00:06:27.070> onto<00:06:27.280> this

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:27.550 
Avenue didn't properly overlay onto this

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:29.960 
Avenue didn't properly overlay onto this
so<00:06:27.850> there<00:06:28.000> was<00:06:28.090> a<00:06:28.120> small<00:06:28.570> piece<00:06:28.900> of<00:06:29.170> this<00:06:29.320> road

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:29.970 
so there was a small piece of this road

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:32.220 
so there was a small piece of this road
coming<00:06:30.970> into<00:06:31.150> there<00:06:31.300> and<00:06:31.450> it<00:06:31.510> was<00:06:31.630> causing<00:06:31.870> a

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:32.230 
coming into there and it was causing a

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:34.560 
coming into there and it was causing a
glitch<00:06:32.740> where<00:06:33.100> the<00:06:33.280> roads<00:06:33.550> weren't<00:06:33.850> connected

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:34.570 
glitch where the roads weren't connected

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:39.180 
glitch where the roads weren't connected
and<00:06:34.780> so<00:06:35.740> all<00:06:36.010> these<00:06:37.000> businesses<00:06:37.870> failed<00:06:38.290> every

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:39.190 
and so all these businesses failed every

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:41.160 
and so all these businesses failed every
single<00:06:39.220> one<00:06:39.640> of<00:06:39.670> them<00:06:39.910> lost<00:06:40.180> everything<00:06:40.990> and<00:06:41.050> I

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:41.170 
single one of them lost everything and I

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:45.450 
single one of them lost everything and I
was<00:06:41.320> in<00:06:41.760> the<00:06:42.760> hole<00:06:43.030> about<00:06:43.420> minus<00:06:43.930> 20<00:06:44.380> credits<00:06:44.800> a

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:45.460 
was in the hole about minus 20 credits a

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.700 
was in the hole about minus 20 credits a
minute<00:06:46.000> it<00:06:46.120> was<00:06:46.210> horrible<00:06:46.570> and<00:06:46.840> took<00:06:47.530> me<00:06:47.680> a

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:47.710 
minute it was horrible and took me a

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:48.810 
minute it was horrible and took me a
while<00:06:47.830> to<00:06:47.890> figure<00:06:48.160> it<00:06:48.340> out<00:06:48.460> but<00:06:48.640> when<00:06:48.790> I

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:48.820 
while to figure it out but when I

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:50.880 
while to figure it out but when I
noticed<00:06:49.060> the<00:06:49.390> lanes<00:06:49.630> cutting<00:06:50.200> into<00:06:50.500> the<00:06:50.620> thing

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:50.890 
noticed the lanes cutting into the thing

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:54.120 
noticed the lanes cutting into the thing
into<00:06:51.850> the<00:06:51.970> actual<00:06:52.650> vertical<00:06:53.650> space<00:06:53.890> here<00:06:54.100> I

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:54.130 
into the actual vertical space here I

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:56.070 
into the actual vertical space here I
went<00:06:54.370> and<00:06:54.460> deleted<00:06:54.820> all<00:06:55.210> the<00:06:55.270> roadways<00:06:56.050> this

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:56.080 
went and deleted all the roadways this

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.810 
went and deleted all the roadways this
one<00:06:56.650> in<00:06:56.830> this<00:06:56.980> one<00:06:57.160> thankfully<00:06:57.400> I<00:06:57.550> didn't<00:06:57.730> have

00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:57.820 
one in this one thankfully I didn't have

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:00.090 
one in this one thankfully I didn't have
to<00:06:57.910> delete<00:06:58.150> the<00:06:58.300> tunnel<00:06:58.630> but<00:06:59.470> I<00:06:59.500> saw<00:06:59.830> it<00:06:59.890> and<00:07:00.040> I

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:00.100 
to delete the tunnel but I saw it and I

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:01.950 
to delete the tunnel but I saw it and I
was<00:07:00.220> able<00:07:00.340> to<00:07:00.550> delete<00:07:00.850> the<00:07:01.000> one<00:07:01.180> path<00:07:01.420> once<00:07:01.840> I

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:01.960 
was able to delete the one path once I

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.660 
was able to delete the one path once I
did<00:07:02.140> that<00:07:02.170> it<00:07:02.590> cleared<00:07:02.920> the<00:07:03.070> whole<00:07:03.220> thing<00:07:03.520> up

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:03.670 
did that it cleared the whole thing up

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:05.280 
did that it cleared the whole thing up
and<00:07:03.790> I<00:07:03.910> haven't<00:07:04.150> had<00:07:04.330> an<00:07:04.450> issue<00:07:04.570> with<00:07:04.750> it<00:07:05.020> since

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:05.290 
and I haven't had an issue with it since

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:08.550 
and I haven't had an issue with it since
so<00:07:05.680> lesson<00:07:06.400> learned
