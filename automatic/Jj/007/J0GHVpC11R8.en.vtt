vocals<00:00:55.170> guitar<00:00:56.010> bass<00:00:57.260> kick<00:00:58.260> drum<00:00:58.649> there's<00:00:59.010> a

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
vocals guitar bass kick drum there's a

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.479 
vocals guitar bass kick drum there's a
preset<00:00:59.550> called<00:00:59.730> valve<00:01:00.649> in<00:01:01.649> addition<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.250> also

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
preset called valve in addition you also

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.329 
preset called valve in addition you also
get<00:01:02.850> an<00:01:02.969> output<00:01:03.149> limiter<00:01:03.840> although<00:01:04.710> in<00:01:05.070> my

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
get an output limiter although in my

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.760 
get an output limiter although in my
opinion<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.240> output<00:01:06.659> limiter<00:01:07.140> is<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.320> little

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
opinion the output limiter is a little

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.969 
opinion the output limiter is a little
too<00:01:08.430> intense<00:01:09.380> we'll<00:01:10.380> listen<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.710> that<00:01:10.799> in<00:01:10.920> a

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
too intense we'll listen to that in a

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.920 
too intense we'll listen to that in a
second<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.580> can<00:01:11.970> hear<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.299> kind<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.510> kicking

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
second you can hear it kind of kicking

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.200 
second you can hear it kind of kicking
in<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.369> pumping<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.490> breathing<00:01:15.000> pretty

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
in and pumping and breathing pretty

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.820 
in and pumping and breathing pretty
intensely<00:01:15.750> it's<00:01:15.990> not<00:01:16.110> it's<00:01:16.380> not<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.530> subtle

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
intensely it's not it's not a subtle

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.520 
intensely it's not it's not a subtle
limiter<00:01:17.420> but<00:01:18.420> anyway<00:01:18.659> this<00:01:18.869> guy<00:01:19.020> does<00:01:19.259> add<00:01:19.500> a

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
limiter but anyway this guy does add a

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.520 
limiter but anyway this guy does add a
little<00:01:19.860> bit<00:01:20.100> of<00:01:20.130> voicing<00:01:20.670> variety<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:22.170> the

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
little bit of voicing variety to the

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.999 
little bit of voicing variety to the
already<00:01:23.250> pretty<00:01:23.610> decent<00:01:24.119> preamp<00:01:25.110> signal<00:01:25.799> path

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009

00:06:21.999 --> 00:06:22.009 
here what we can get out of it so there

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:24.820 
here what we can get out of it so there
you<00:06:22.129> go<00:06:22.219> that's<00:06:22.400> the<00:06:22.550> AR<00:06:22.879> T<00:06:23.060> tube<00:06:23.330> MP<00:06:23.629> studio<00:06:24.050> v3

you go that's the AR T tube MP studio v3
and<00:06:25.750> you<00:06:26.750> know<00:06:26.870> it's<00:06:27.169> it<00:06:27.500> does<00:06:27.800> add<00:06:28.039> a<00:06:28.069> little

00:06:28.269 --> 00:06:28.279 
and you know it's it does add a little

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:30.219 
and you know it's it does add a little
bit<00:06:28.490> of<00:06:28.580> variety<00:06:28.699> on<00:06:29.060> top<00:06:29.419> of<00:06:29.599> what<00:06:29.750> the<00:06:29.840> basics

00:06:30.219 --> 00:06:30.229 
bit of variety on top of what the basics

it's<00:06:34.879> really<00:06:35.270> nice<00:06:35.419> that<00:06:35.569> it<00:06:35.659> has<00:06:35.689> that<00:06:35.960> vu

00:06:36.399 --> 00:06:36.409 
it's really nice that it has that vu

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:39.550 
it's really nice that it has that vu
meter<00:06:36.650> and<00:06:37.360> you<00:06:38.360> can<00:06:38.599> get<00:06:38.810> sort<00:06:39.139> of<00:06:39.229> you<00:06:39.469> know

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:39.560 
meter and you can get sort of you know

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:40.929 
meter and you can get sort of you know
some<00:06:39.740> of<00:06:39.800> these<00:06:39.889> settings<00:06:40.219> I<00:06:40.310> find<00:06:40.729> a<00:06:40.819> little

00:06:40.929 --> 00:06:40.939 
some of these settings I find a little

00:06:40.939 --> 00:06:42.700 
some of these settings I find a little
bit<00:06:41.090> too<00:06:41.270> harsh<00:06:41.599> and<00:06:42.139> I<00:06:42.199> don't<00:06:42.259> necessarily

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:42.710 
bit too harsh and I don't necessarily

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:44.649 
bit too harsh and I don't necessarily
find<00:06:42.889> the<00:06:43.099> output<00:06:43.250> a<00:06:43.669> limiting<00:06:44.029> functions<00:06:44.479> to

00:06:44.649 --> 00:06:44.659 
find the output a limiting functions to

00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:48.490 
find the output a limiting functions to
be<00:06:44.690> very<00:06:45.139> practical<00:06:46.360> but<00:06:47.360> a<00:06:47.659> few<00:06:48.319> of<00:06:48.440> these

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:48.500 
be very practical but a few of these

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.890 
be very practical but a few of these
settings<00:06:48.889> do<00:06:49.159> offer<00:06:49.430> some<00:06:49.789> nice<00:06:50.120> alternatives

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:50.900 
settings do offer some nice alternatives

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:55.119 
settings do offer some nice alternatives
to<00:06:51.110> that<00:06:51.259> sort<00:06:51.589> of<00:06:51.759> default<00:06:52.759> tube<00:06:53.240> MP<00:06:53.960> sound<00:06:54.860> so

00:06:55.119 --> 00:06:55.129 
to that sort of default tube MP sound so

00:06:55.129 --> 00:06:56.740 
to that sort of default tube MP sound so
you<00:06:55.190> get<00:06:55.370> a<00:06:55.400> little<00:06:55.669> bit<00:06:55.759> more<00:06:55.940> tonal<00:06:56.360> variety

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:56.750 
you get a little bit more tonal variety

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:01.499 
you get a little bit more tonal variety
out<00:06:56.870> of<00:06:56.960> this<00:06:57.080> guy<00:06:57.259> then<00:06:58.159> then<00:06:58.909> it's<00:06:59.089> a<00:07:00.400> simpler

00:07:01.499 --> 00:07:01.509 
out of this guy then then it's a simpler

00:07:01.509 --> 00:07:04.990 
out of this guy then then it's a simpler
line<00:07:02.509> sibling<00:07:03.250> so<00:07:04.250> yeah

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:05.000
