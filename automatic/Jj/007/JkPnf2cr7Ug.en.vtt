00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.709 
things had settled down again and I
think<00:02:03.460> another<00:02:03.640> of<00:02:03.880> the<00:02:04.000> reds<00:02:04.210> players<00:02:04.450> has

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:04.719 
think another of the reds players has

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:07.740 
think another of the reds players has
gone<00:02:04.929> down<00:02:05.579> it's<00:02:06.579> okay<00:02:06.909> I'm<00:02:07.090> sure<00:02:07.299> it's<00:02:07.479> just<00:02:07.539> a

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
gone down it's okay I'm sure it's just a

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.630 
gone down it's okay I'm sure it's just a
forward<00:02:08.349> or<00:02:08.590> something<00:02:08.950> they'll<00:02:09.429> be<00:02:09.489> all

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
forward or something they'll be all

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.839 
forward or something they'll be all
right<00:02:09.789> oh<00:02:10.090> crap<00:02:10.810> it's<00:02:10.840> a<00:02:11.080> 10<00:02:11.349> dear<00:02:12.040> God<00:02:12.400> why

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849 
right oh crap it's a 10 dear God why

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:14.970 
right oh crap it's a 10 dear God why
yeah<00:02:13.720> I<00:02:13.750> think<00:02:13.989> it's<00:02:14.080> a<00:02:14.170> sprig<00:02:14.470> he's<00:02:14.590> got<00:02:14.799> there

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
yeah I think it's a sprig he's got there

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.650 
yeah I think it's a sprig he's got there
it's<00:02:15.340> just<00:02:15.549> clip<00:02:15.760> them<00:02:15.879> they're<00:02:16.090> just<00:02:16.510> right

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
it's just clip them they're just right

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.420 
it's just clip them they're just right
well<00:02:16.989> this<00:02:17.049> is<00:02:17.200> an<00:02:17.319> issue<00:02:17.410> it<00:02:17.830> turns<00:02:18.040> out<00:02:18.190> he

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
well this is an issue it turns out he

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.729 
well this is an issue it turns out he
was<00:02:18.610> all<00:02:18.760> right<00:02:18.900> but<00:02:19.900> the<00:02:20.019> Reds<00:02:20.200> lost<00:02:20.440> the

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
was all right but the Reds lost the

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.440 
was all right but the Reds lost the
Crusaders<00:02:21.310> matched<00:02:21.549> the<00:02:21.730> only<00:02:22.030> try<00:02:22.269> of<00:02:22.299> the

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
Crusaders matched the only try of the

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.220 
Crusaders matched the only try of the
game<00:02:22.660> with<00:02:22.930> five<00:02:23.310> Fievel<00:02:24.310> penalties<00:02:24.849> I<00:02:25.230> think

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
game with five Fievel penalties I think

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.319 
game with five Fievel penalties I think
we<00:02:26.410> really<00:02:26.829> know<00:02:27.010> who<00:02:27.220> won<00:02:27.459> don't<00:02:27.819> we<00:02:28.000> Todd
