00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:08.740
 hello together this is my review about 

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:10.349
 the mode screenplay not and that will 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.360
 I unpack now for the first time 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:23.070
 that's nine times 14 in size 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:30.939
 centimeter I think this is a 65 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:34.930
 then this is about for me 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:37.300
 half even a bit higher that 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:41.200
 already there and accordingly it is one 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:43.899
 a6 in the mentioned size as mentioned 99 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:48.070
 For three and a half or 15 lines times 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:01:06.810
 halftime has 192 sheets and that look 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:01:11.560
 Let us now first not only 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:14.470
 Unpacking , of course, noticed quite a bit 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:22.890
 Classical Moleskine always known that 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:26.340
 band first product name gone 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.340
 Full Page 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:34.000
 and here we go down here 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:38.230
 again with the beautiful embossed and 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.660
 screens no lettering on the rubber wall 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:46.060
 as already mentioned the part too 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:49.300
 remains and the classic of the color 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.130
 Her classic pages with the hint 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.440
 of the country is lost 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.280
 There is a reward material you can get 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.280
 of course one 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:04.820
 that feels pretty good here 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:10.369
 my first impression is a bit of light 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:16.280
 can better recognize the very valuable 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:18.980
 is a bit badly glued here 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:22.120
 okay that's gone now i hope so 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:28.970
 holds or does not happen 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:32.690
 Oh that's strong and I knew that 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:37.280
 nor is virtually the that's just 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:44.360
 Advertising a funnier you have to 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:50.030
 first read through plain culture in 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:53.420
 augsburg by moleskine ok and as 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:56.260
 Sign of quality control together 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.700
 so currently no vulnerable shown 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.140
 Can you still answer me? 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.420
 Write the comments and we will 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.180
 of course, now advances to the 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:09.440
 actually important this review its 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:11.989
 Tests caseking plans of courage proved 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:17.840
 means to write a great a6 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:20.030
 lets and I have to do that 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:23.860
 a couple of pins distributed 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:27.140
 faber castell pencil two and a half 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:29.360
 then a parka whole york just one 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:34.310
 pens now pretty much everyone 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:35.020
 stand schaaf one recognizes yes to it 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.790
 the case 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:42.830
 and last but not least is one of his 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:44.570
 beautiful blue ball as mine 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.769
 favorite pieces from my fashion 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:51.440
 collection does not have a small collection 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:53.989
 and I've been around this before 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:57.290
 date I think we have the 13th today 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:59.100
 Thirteen is sure to be mine 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:04.170
 the most beautiful font 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:04.170
 seventh 2013 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:11.440
 it does not shine through so it is 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.670
 absolutely fine and honest here 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.470
 print a little bit what that too though 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:17.230
 but they still put a little pressure 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.730
 the important thing is it has not 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.040
 pushed through so the ink is not 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:23.530
 Weigh through the paper more often 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.600
 has read something on the internet 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:29.140
 could happen so that the test 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.220
 with the rollerball as the next test 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:34.720
 let's take the park agatha 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:37.050
 pen again realistic 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:40.050
 Write the date again 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.050
 among them 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.730
 I'm just someone who cares about that 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.420
 Firm press the paper now relatively 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.420
 thin 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:02.650
 with the ink , it expresses much more 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:10.570
 by than the one at the roller 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:12.550
 when as ballpoint and assigned 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.960
 after the light and I in 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.460
 Lately, angriffig happy again 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.380
 Write because it really is one 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:24.490
 Diversity is at all about this 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:25.450
 the digital world we see that 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.540
 expresses financially, of course 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:30.040
 logically least not 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:32.080
 maybe even more 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:34.870
 really the pen by but 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.430
 I think that it is with the vacation or 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.310
 quite well running Hermann sees halt 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.930
 the pressure points the initial points and 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:44.320
 a bit quiet then up and down 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:48.400
 that was very clear that 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:52.600
 Do not stay good that you mean it 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:54.190
 to the corn kingsley notebook and me 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.740
 I wish you much fun with the review 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:58.900
 and the straight or schalke I have with 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:01.690
 Amazon ordered it for 11 euros 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:03.490
 Emails in detail a bit expensive and 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:05.140
 but there are also cheaper me 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:06.950
 I believe around 9 or 10 euros 

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:08.690
 I wanted to have and have fast 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:12.490
