00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 law 3 book well i have to try 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.210
 answer a question that haunts 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.440
 majority of voters because we buy 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.360
 all the books 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.049
 the first reason that comes to mind 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.000
 are the marine promotions is serious when 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.710
 do you see a book for 9 90 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.770
 most readers do not exist there and 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.600
 With one, you already have a book or a book. 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.820
 Who was a blogger bought right? 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.660
 because he also had someone or something from 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.210
 type 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.359
 there also comes in the head part of the 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.270
 publisher editions of books by 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.980
 example jurors games left editing 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.590
 emotional tension 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.719
 then I ended up first in English itself 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.250
 and 10 in the American competition. 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.809
 Incoherence in Brazil was accompanied by 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.180
 With attention in Brazil 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.730
 there I left in the UK a black cape that 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.000
 is the same video installation of the 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.710
 Brazil won the black cape wants to use the 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.230
 version of the uterus 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.879
 Last month, I left in the 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:02.730
 Australia a collector's edition of 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:07.229
 golden games that one in three 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:10.710
 I went there and bought some 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.780
 three American ticket options the owner 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:17.000
 national level to talk to him I want 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:19.770
 say to him that I'm something 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.110
 excellent national level and you want 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.950
 you see that we end up in the culture and 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:30.090
 another and another and another guilty in that 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:31.560
 time is an addiction is the dilemma 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.780
 You go into the culture, you get a book. 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.270
 Did you like reading a happy case? 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.340
 on this different continent 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.299
 he was walking the culture since 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:46.320
 I found this version here is a 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.939
 version you will go right to the cathedral 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.729
 I think it's reflecting something. 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.930
 which is a version of meeting the woman 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.930
 also special 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:02:04.080
 I hate so much that the black uniform will 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.080
 to see because of the shadow 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.570
 here comes the continuation part of series 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.160
 Do you have a series here in Brazil? 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.710
 I do not know if most people with 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.960
 law have English habit or also 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.730
 when I leave you have a book ailson 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.590
 another book that in brazil you will 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:24.880
 want to know if the 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:27.580
 history if you do not want but 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:35.530
 next to explain is the book of 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:37.959
 shadows of jasmine went record on white 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:41.440
 Brazil last year in France do not 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:45.370
 I'll cheat soon when he calls me. 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:47.430
 shift is the second volume of the series when 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.350
 I finished today 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:53.320
 then along then we together with 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:56.560
 pee fill the third volume of the 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.330
 series then this is that medium that is a 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.470
 circus you buy a series that goes 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.530
 want to continue your conviction 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:05.769
 continuation business continuation of the series 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:09.150
 who thinks he has been with her longer - 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:11.320
 the Livian Gadotti think it's martin 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.810
 originally published by deadly 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.370
 Record people here in Brazil is notorious 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.130
 the point is that those bone age 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.799
 of instances we are going to fall 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.170
 there goes 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:25.600
 Another reason is this when you see 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.700
 cinema you do not sc watch the movie and 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.739
 like the movie you ask will it be that a 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.130
 book 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:34.690
 this is usually the case for most 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:38.230
 adaptations of films, but since the 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.820
 last year down has book examples 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.209
 that comes to my mind when I left 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:50.890
 cinema looking book eagerly 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:53.220
 was finally seems to be invisible is a 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.220
 american version 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:04:00.010
 and here I got more talent was this 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.200
 kind heard Wednesday in the 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.990
 time of the film's release on Friday 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.130
 I never got home, I bought this 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.200
 american version 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:11.410
 not satisfied the following week 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.540
 submarine guilty and marina announced 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:15.310
 this national version published by the 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:20.050
 publisher new frontier until there the house 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:21.640
 will open even better he knows this version 

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:24.990
 she posed as this is that 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.990
 also puts the film is different 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.940
 There are people who buy a book because 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.560
 He looks beautiful on the shelf has several 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.870
 so stay here in my room that does not 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.400
 have to get up because you have to get up 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:39.760
 and not cutting the video, either 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.650
 to do this also has here a book 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.690
 that you do not know when you see there but 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.790
 You end up buying the guys too. 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:48.870
 at that time they published see what 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:48.870
 changed my life during the gymkhana 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:57.940
 He is one of those who is far away but 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.710
 He's very good, too. 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.850
 carnival week I was reading 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.490
 this book 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:05.800
 we buy anything from what is not summer 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.690
 without you also author of the movie series 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.750
 that are miguel is without a referendum 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:12.760
 now by the canon and now comes the part that 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:16.360
 I think positives are good of indications 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:18.340
 of blogs, sites and friends 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:22.380
 this book that calls Ted is arrested the 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.380
 spell of the desire of the crisis to confer 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.710
 I did not know of his release but 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:29.200
 happened on several blogs and for 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:31.210
 positive reviews and I finished our 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.890
 ship the book is super for twenty-one 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:35.350
 reais and twenty-two did not remember the 

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:36.730
 Eventually I ended up buying 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:38.320
 when you when you see many 

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:40.240
 positive reviews in a book you 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:43.150
 speak that the will to read 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.740
 Who has never been to a football bookstore? 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.610
 that our time to invent the site 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.110
 need him 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:50.740
 so I think most of the reasons 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:54.250
 buy book then between deals 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:56.290
 marine blog builds of friends and 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:57.940
 also for server continuations 

00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:00.070
 it's the three villains 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:02.470
 Can I say 'good now I see you 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:04.810
 share the reasons why you 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:07.540
 buy both books can leave here 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:09.820
 in the comments and try to create a man 

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:11.830
 that would have a conversation is a discussion 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:14.200
 between readers and commentators 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:16.510
 here on youtube also in the next 

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:19.300
 videos can we do any some link 

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:21.880
 also calls another blog to talk about 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:24.100
 so if we want our tag too 

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.540
 They can use it to feel comfortable. 

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:28.300
 have a youtube channel can create a 

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:30.580
 post written also just send the link to 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.180
 people just got bonuses on twitter or not 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:32.680
 Facebook 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:34.990
 if you like the video be clickon 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:37.240
 I liked it here and also if you want 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:39.070
 receive all lit from the e-book to 

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:41.350
 every time again we update 

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:42.220
 cycle is also part of our 

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:44.980
 channel 

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:46.780
 if you are making such a video apa 

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:49.150
 probability that it will appear in the 

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:50.650
 youtube is too big for this is good 

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:52.840
 because both the altitude and the 

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:54.580
 readers who are promoting the site 

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:56.770
 also taking a little more 

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:59.200
 knowledge to acquire new experiences 

00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:00.910
 and even making new friends torrijo has 

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:03.460
 many people who know the network 

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:05.410
 Become a friend or an internet friend. 

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:08.020
 the magician is not being able to respond 

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:10.270
 question of why buy all 

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:12.460
 other books hold other motives 

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:15.850
 and justifications you can do but I 

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:17.710
 I think the video to be very good I think 

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:19.450
 I already said a lot, I was going to be very 

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:21.610
 long at the hotel 

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:24.870
 the video of why we bought so many 

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:24.870
 stars is around here
