00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.370
 you can find false nails 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.440
 also individual and belongs to all 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.610
 sizes 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:57.030
 We will use the crazy or glue to 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.980
 the nails or can use adhesive to 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.970
 the teeth 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:06.270
 a nail clipper or something to cut some 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.940
 scissors a file to shape the 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.970
 tooth 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:14.300
 and well the first thing we are going to do 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:16.450
 let's choose the false nail that is 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.149
 of the size of the tooth 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:22.580
 we are measuring so that the little beaks 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:24.950
 we are not going to hurt the gum 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:29.810
 and with the file we will give you the 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:33.760
 curved shape of our fang to 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:36.750
 apply it on the tooth towards the gum 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:40.120
 and we are going to remove the thick ones 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.820
 then we measure to know if we have 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:46.900
 that to file more I was asked if 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:48.970
 put global tooth was toxic 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.580
 they will only put it one day and not 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:54.280
 I think nothing happens to them and they're going to 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.820
 apply only on the tooth not on the 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.600
 gum 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:01.390
 as soon as we make sure that it is 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.460
 of our size we are going to cut back the 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:07.120
 nail to the size that we want our 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:09.130
 fangs whether they are very short big 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.210
 different size then we're going to 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.640
 trim 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.980
 as soon as we have it, we have it trimmed 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:22.490
 Now we are going to give you the shape of 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:25.650
 fang that is a little sharp and we're going 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:29.689
 to bend the lime 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.689
 up and down 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.000
 giving shape to the tooth since it 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.700
 I went back to doing this video because in the 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.920
 past they had many questions and I wanted to 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:45.910
 go back to do this video 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:49.390
 good since since it is in the fang 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:52.710
 the way we want now we're going 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:55.290
 to apply with the crazy or the blues 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:58.170
 and we're going to hit it but for that 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.870
 we must have the tooth very clean and 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:04.140
 dry with a napkin that does not have 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.480
 saliva and we are going to press it so that 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.879
 this paste 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.430
 and the way they can remove it is 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:15.629
 super easy just press it towards 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:19.099
 up and it came out and they do not hurt or anything 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:23.160
 now let's apply the red lipstick 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:25.760
 intense or equal they can apply a color 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.760
 black 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:31.740
 and on that I'm going to apply one more 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.870
 intense darker if you want to see the 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:35.940
 video that I had done before how 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.920
 make the vampire teeth the 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.900
 fangs down I'm going to leave you in the 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.230
 description box the link so that 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:47.440
 they see it and good since since it paints the 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:50.590
 lips now I'm going to apply blood 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:54.720
 towards the sides of the lips as if I 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.720
 I would have just taken a sandwich 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:01.430
 and I'm going to put it with a stick so that 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:04.670
 so thin 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:06.980
 to drain the thin blood and not 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:10.930
 is very thick you can 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:14.150
 use a blood dropper 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:16.820
 synthetic can be bought in the 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:19.690
 pharmacy or where they sell everything from 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.700
 Halloween 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:25.130
 you can also do it 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:28.670
 with your law 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:31.150
 or with gelatin for gelatin also 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:31.150
 they can do it 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.310
 because many videos of how can 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.960
 make the blood come you put it 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:42.800
 the way you want 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:44.660
 and how do I tell them the nails and all the 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.960
 You can find materials in the 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:49.550
 pharmacy or where they sell beauty things 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.370
 teeth 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:56.060
 last approximately 3 to 4 hours 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:58.310
 you can remove them when you want and 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:02.380
 Do not forget to bring some extra teeth 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.380
 and glue for any accident
