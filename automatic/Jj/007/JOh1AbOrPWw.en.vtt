corn syrup now in the past I've used

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.459 
corn syrup now in the past I've used
corn<00:00:33.149> syrup<00:00:33.510> but<00:00:33.570> I've<00:00:33.719> had<00:00:33.870> people<00:00:34.200> told<00:00:34.410> me

corn syrup but I've had people told me

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.010 
corn syrup but I've had people told me
that<00:00:34.530> they<00:00:34.649> can't<00:00:35.010> find<00:00:35.370> it<00:00:35.660> so<00:00:36.660> what<00:00:36.840> I'll<00:00:36.899> do

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
that they can't find it so what I'll do

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.600 
that they can't find it so what I'll do
is<00:00:37.170> I'll<00:00:37.320> leave<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.559> link<00:00:37.710> down<00:00:37.770> below<00:00:38.010> to<00:00:38.399> my

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
is I'll leave a link down below to my

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.240 
is I'll leave a link down below to my
video<00:00:38.910> and<00:00:39.059> how<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.239> make<00:00:39.480> your<00:00:39.600> own<00:00:39.660> at<00:00:39.840> home

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
video and how to make your own at home

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.670 
video and how to make your own at home
so<00:00:41.250> just<00:00:41.280> gently<00:00:42.180> stir<00:00:42.570> it<00:00:42.690> over<00:00:42.780> medium<00:00:43.200> to

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
so just gently stir it over medium to

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.040 
so just gently stir it over medium to
high<00:00:43.860> heat<00:00:44.100> until<00:00:44.510> the<00:00:45.510> sugar<00:00:45.539> is<00:00:46.020> completely

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
high heat until the sugar is completely

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.889 
high heat until the sugar is completely
dissolved<00:00:46.940> hey<00:00:47.940> once<00:00:48.120> it's<00:00:48.270> dissolved<00:00:48.510> we're

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
dissolved hey once it's dissolved we're

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.479 
dissolved hey once it's dissolved we're
just<00:00:49.110> going<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.350> bring<00:00:49.559> it<00:00:49.680> up<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:49.920> boil

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
just going to bring it up to a boil

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.250 
just going to bring it up to a boil
by<00:00:51.210> keeping<00:00:51.360> every<00:00:51.629> one<00:00:51.719> medium<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:51.989> high<00:00:52.230> heat

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
by keeping every one medium to high heat

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.529 
by keeping every one medium to high heat
then<00:00:52.680> put<00:00:52.829> it<00:00:52.920> on<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.039> very<00:00:53.340> pilot<00:00:53.820> we<00:00:54.270> want<00:00:54.449> to

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
then put it on a very pilot we want to

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.889 
then put it on a very pilot we want to
bring<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:54.809> up<00:00:54.870> slowly<00:00:56.360> so<00:00:57.360> next<00:00:57.570> we're<00:00:57.750> going

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
bring it up slowly so next we're going

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.650 
bring it up slowly so next we're going
to<00:00:58.020> add<00:00:58.140> in<00:00:58.289> some<00:00:58.530> black<00:00:58.829> food<00:00:59.730> coloring<00:00:59.760> so

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
to add in some black food coloring so

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.599 
to add in some black food coloring so
just<00:01:01.170> add<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.289> few<00:01:01.559> drops<00:01:01.710> just<00:01:02.160> until<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.460> get

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
just add a few drops just until you get

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.479 
just add a few drops just until you get
to<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.850> desired<00:01:03.270> shade<00:01:03.949> and<00:01:04.949> next<00:01:05.189> using<00:01:05.369> a

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
to the desired shade and next using a

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.100 
to the desired shade and next using a
wet<00:01:05.640> brush<00:01:05.880> which<00:01:06.330> is<00:01:06.360> going<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.689> brush<00:01:06.930> down

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
wet brush which is going to brush down

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.960 
wet brush which is going to brush down
the<00:01:07.229> sides<00:01:07.500> just<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.340> get<00:01:08.460> rid<00:01:08.549> of<00:01:08.610> that<00:01:08.700> sugar

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
the sides just to get rid of that sugar

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.010 
the sides just to get rid of that sugar
there<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.390> that's<00:01:09.510> going<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.720> help<00:01:09.840> prevent

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
there and that's going to help prevent

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.469 
there and that's going to help prevent
those<00:01:10.560> nasty<00:01:11.130> sugar<00:01:11.430> crystals<00:01:11.850> from<00:01:12.420> forming

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
those nasty sugar crystals from forming

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.340 
those nasty sugar crystals from forming
on<00:01:13.080> top<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.530> our<00:01:13.680> syrup<00:01:14.810> so<00:01:15.810> next<00:01:15.990> we're<00:01:16.229> going

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
on top of our syrup so next we're going

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.350 
on top of our syrup so next we're going
to<00:01:16.500> use<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.650> thermometer<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.909> we<00:01:18.030> wanted<00:01:18.299> to

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
to use a thermometer and we wanted to

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.190 
to use a thermometer and we wanted to
count<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.750> 300<00:01:19.740> degrees<00:01:20.040> Fahrenheit<00:01:20.369> or<00:01:21.200> 150

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
count to 300 degrees Fahrenheit or 150

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.620 
count to 300 degrees Fahrenheit or 150
degrees<00:01:22.560> Celsius<00:01:23.070> so<00:01:24.030> we<00:01:24.150> want<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.360> go<00:01:24.450> up<00:01:24.509> to

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
degrees Celsius so we want to go up to

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.899 
degrees Celsius so we want to go up to
the<00:01:24.720> hard<00:01:24.960> crack<00:01:25.259> stage<00:01:25.320> now<00:01:26.220> these<00:01:26.400> candy

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
the hard crack stage now these candy

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.240 
the hard crack stage now these candy

on<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.509> medium<00:01:33.780> heat<00:01:33.960> it's<00:01:34.229> gonna<00:01:34.290> take<00:01:34.590> about

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
on a medium heat it's gonna take about

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.219 
on a medium heat it's gonna take about
10<00:01:35.640> minutes<00:01:35.670> give<00:01:36.090> or<00:01:36.119> take<00:01:36.299> don't<00:01:36.900> have<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.140> on

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
10 minutes give or take don't have it on

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.660 
10 minutes give or take don't have it on
a<00:01:37.290> very<00:01:37.470> high<00:01:37.710> temperature<00:01:37.950> you<00:01:38.430> want<00:01:38.549> to

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
a very high temperature you want to

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.640 
a very high temperature you want to
bring<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:38.939> up<00:01:39.060> slowly<00:01:39.659> that's<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.350> reason<00:01:40.560> why

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
bring it up slowly that's the reason why

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.200 
bring it up slowly that's the reason why
most<00:01:40.860> candy<00:01:41.310> will<00:01:41.430> fail<00:01:41.640> because<00:01:42.090> you've

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
most candy will fail because you've

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.550 
most candy will fail because you've
brought<00:01:42.540> it<00:01:42.689> up<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:42.899> temperature<00:01:43.200> too

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
brought it up to the temperature too

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.679 
brought it up to the temperature too
