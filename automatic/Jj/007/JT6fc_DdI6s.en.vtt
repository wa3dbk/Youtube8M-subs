if they didn't paint the part of the
plastic<00:04:45.050> there<00:04:45.200> so<00:04:45.410> it's<00:04:45.530> clear<00:04:45.950> just<00:04:46.730> kind<00:04:46.970> of

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
plastic there so it's clear just kind of

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.540 
plastic there so it's clear just kind of
weird<00:04:47.270> but<00:04:47.600> cool<00:04:48.230> at<00:04:48.500> the<00:04:48.530> same<00:04:48.620> time<00:04:49.040> a<00:04:49.340> little
