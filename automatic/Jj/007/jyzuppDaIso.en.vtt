00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:18.520
 Ahh ah ah ah 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.740
 U 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.440
 Ah 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:52.739
 Oh Oh Oh 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:55.770
 There must be a lot of ways to drive green. 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:59.970
 These days automobiles are usually automatic transmissions. 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:04.290
 I think there's a way to save energy using this automatic transmission. 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:07.979
 Depending on how you use the automatic transmission itself 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:13.470
 I can see that the results of fuel consumption are very different . For example, 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:17.910
 The energy saving is also depending on the position of the driving nod and the position of the nn dn 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:22.229
 I go to the downtown community because it is quite different 4 In the case of repeated toilets 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:24.270
 Depending on usage to reduce fuel consumption to such an extent that the effect is dependent at least 20% of the total 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:28.509
 There's a very important part. 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.540
 So I'm going to let you go today about how to do it. 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:30.540
 U 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:42.950
 Here's fucking car minicar I gotta automatic transmission is mounted 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:46.340
 How the automatic transmission due to Lee Yo-won energy savings, depending on the size 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.510
 Let me explain how to do it well , centering on this automatic transmission. 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.950
 I'll do it 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:56.630
 Now this is an automatic transmission is usually itgoyo parking mode is p, then the reverse 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:02:00.830
 r neutral then there is usually a lot of running d 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:03.110
 Beneath I understand there is a lot that automatically bieoseo awoke before we General 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:07.310
 Usually when you move the lever 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.720
 Usually I usually spend a lot of traveling somewhere and these opportunities at all age 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.650
 There are a lot of cases 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.210
 Whether it's a climb up a hill or a downhill road, 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.120
 It's not usually used. 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:22.250
 Especially now, 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:27.890
 Repeat this step in front of the shoe 8, depending on the position of the lever on this transmission 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:33.080
 The energy savings is a party to 20% of the total amount of energy savings 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:37.730
 If you see a pretty direct when I came dwien Odin harassment usually lead 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:39.290
 Release the brakes after driving a bright nails when you are stopped in front of traffic lights 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:44.090
 It's the most common thing. 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:46.790
 In this case , because there is a portion where energy is always consumed, 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:51.170
 So what is wrong energy savings 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:55.430
 Therefore, usually hold the brake and do not put it behind the road in front of the treatment 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:03:00.170
 It turned into a red hate, and then the length is usually two minutes and three minutes. 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:04.550
 Because there are so many at this time when you put it in Odin n where it bites back from where it runs 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:09.530
 That energy is consuming that much. 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:14.120
 That's when you see the eco- dry indicator attached directly to the front . 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:17.600
 2 Diagode 4 Checking the position shows that the fuel saving effect is already 10% 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:22.910
 You can also check that you have 15% 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:26.870
 If you look at it now , when you're behind the wheel, hey, it goes up a lot. 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:30.590
 I can see that heat and fuel are consuming a lot. 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:34.880
 Do not you think it will reduce by two spaces in Bagan 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:36.350
 If this is gonna be so much a part of the accumulated savings, especially a lot of downtown 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:41.000
 Like those who run 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:45.320
 The savings in fuel use are usually as high as 15 to 20% 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:49.640
 And one of the misconceptions is that Diagoen often comes and goes 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:50.530
 If the automatic transmission does not increase the frequency of failure , 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.819
 I have. 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:04:00.280
 Why do you think that's because the canals are personality in the face of urgency. 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:04:02.950
 DIAGO Animation I stepped on the accelerator pedal to make a battery before it was fully converted. 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:07.959
 This transmission is going to go a long way. 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:12.880
 So if you just give it a tempo and it turns green on this traffic light, 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:17.709
 Put it back. After 0.5 seconds , step on the accelerator pedal to make it slow. 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:18.790
 When the transmission is granted considerable amount of energy savings without failure is occurring 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.570
 I can raise it. 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:26.620
 So make good use of d and n, and p 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:31.480
 Ela effect. It would be nice to recognize that it is the same. And 1 and 2 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:35.890
 As I said before, if you use it properly on this hill or downhill , 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:38.100
 I'd say it's the best way to increase safety with energy . 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.100
 can 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:54.780
 I know there's not a lot of people equipped with a manual transmission these days. 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:59.250
 I 've heard that there are a lot of 2.2 for the auto guy . Yeah. 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:02.070
 2 If the automatic transmission is domestic, it is 99% 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:06.780
 There is often no choice. 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:11.910
 Such a manual gearbox is a lot of remodeling if it is a long way to go. 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:12.420
 In comparison with the automatic transmission, the steering ratio is open to 20% 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:16.350
 It's high. 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:20.100
 It's just as much as I can get, 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:24.600
 To send off the new and the purchase more than one million won FIG haeboda manual shift 0 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:26.550
 Doeguyo pay nitty automatic transmission with another social aspects and fix also ensures pindeo 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:30.060
 There's a lot more gadgets out there. 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:33.540
 One of the more important things is that you usually use it for a regular automatic transmission 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:37.740
 In the case of np 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:42.870
 This week I decided to write the applications'm going to row but not until manually 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:46.230
 The transmission is uphill, if well utilized in downhill road side or reverse fuel efficiency 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:51.000
 So you must be the one when quite significant in terms of standing up a hill to climb 

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:54.690
 You can change the stage 2 or 3 to the carol , or you can set the date downhill. 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:57.030
 If you use it, it will brake on this puff because of the engine brake . 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:06:01.280
 It has the advantage of a very high degree of safety. 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:05.790
 The few in the country in that regard, but be a little passive pinch 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:09.380
 It's much better if you learn how to use it by activating an automatic transmission 

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:09.380
 I am looking at the benefits of this 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:20.390
 I have few enemies when I'm on the ship line . 

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:23.840
 I did not know you'd make a lot of difference . 

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:27.920
 In the future , I would like to spend some time on the stop line or on good days. 

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:32.450
 Yes've thought deuneyo such as poetry, especially when passing on two downtown 

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:36.980
 It takes a lot. When it turns red, it's usually behind the driving mode. 

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:41.330
 There rocket outer surface of this bamboo grove Odin is a 415% whole philosophy of energy 

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:44.080
 To 20%, so you can save energy that you can recommend 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.080
 Is the way
