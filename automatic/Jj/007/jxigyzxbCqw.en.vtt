one<00:00:17.699> type<00:00:18.000> car<00:00:19.850> but<00:00:20.850> it's<00:00:21.000> pretty<00:00:21.150> much<00:00:21.390> the

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
one type car but it's pretty much the

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.410 
one type car but it's pretty much the
same<00:00:21.750> for<00:00:22.199> all<00:00:22.380> your<00:00:22.590> axles<00:00:23.330> basically<00:00:24.330> we

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
same for all your axles basically we

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.439 
same for all your axles basically we
start<00:00:24.689> by<00:00:24.840> taking<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.350> slotted<00:00:25.710> pulley<00:00:25.949> and

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:26.449 
start by taking the slotted pulley and

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:31.400 
start by taking the slotted pulley and
sliding<00:00:27.449> it<00:00:27.599> over<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.529> axle<00:00:28.859> assembly<00:00:30.410> we

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
sliding it over the axle assembly we

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.670 
sliding it over the axle assembly we
then<00:00:31.590> take<00:00:31.800> our<00:00:32.009> allen<00:00:32.369> key<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:33.350> clamp<00:00:34.350> the

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
the V slots on the axle carrier now

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.380 
the V slots on the axle carrier now
before<00:01:13.830> we<00:01:13.979> turn<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.340> power<00:01:14.729> on<00:01:14.939> we<00:01:15.150> need<00:01:15.330> to

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
before we turn the power on we need to

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.050 
before we turn the power on we need to
just<00:01:15.750> make<00:01:15.869> sure<00:01:16.049> that<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:17.040> bushes<00:01:17.759> are

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
just make sure that the bushes are

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.539 
just make sure that the bushes are
sitting<00:01:18.570> in<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:19.020> V<00:01:19.200> slots<00:01:21.979> it's<00:01:22.979> important<00:01:23.490> to

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
sitting in the V slots it's important to

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.240 
sitting in the V slots it's important to
check<00:01:23.759> that<00:01:23.820> because<00:01:24.540> if<00:01:24.869> you<00:01:24.990> don't<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.560> you

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
check that because if you don't and you

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.550 
check that because if you don't and you
turn<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.700> machine<00:01:27.060> on<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.479> allow<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.869> axle

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
turn the machine on and allow the axle

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.090 
turn the machine on and allow the axle
to<00:01:29.070> spin<00:01:29.100> in<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.759> V<00:01:29.970> spot<00:01:30.299> sorts<00:01:30.780> rather<00:01:31.680> than

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
to spin in the V spot sorts rather than

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.030 
to spin in the V spot sorts rather than
the<00:01:32.549> bushes<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.150> will<00:01:33.900> cause<00:01:34.229> wear<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.860> the

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
the bushes you will cause wear to the

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.569 
the bushes you will cause wear to the
aluminium<00:01:36.030> carrier<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.229> over<00:01:38.100> time<00:01:38.340> the

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
aluminium carrier and over time the

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.730 
aluminium carrier and over time the
machine<00:01:38.909> will<00:01:39.090> lose<00:01:39.240> its<00:01:39.450> accuracy<00:01:40.049> so<00:01:40.530> just

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
machine will lose its accuracy so just

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.840 
machine will lose its accuracy so just
double-check<00:01:41.220> that<00:01:41.250> that's<00:01:41.579> always<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.150> case

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
double-check that that's always the case

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.730 
double-check that that's always the case
paster<00:01:44.850> just<00:01:45.060> put<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.299> drop<00:01:45.450> of<00:01:45.540> oil<00:01:45.869> onto<00:01:46.590> your

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
paster just put a drop of oil onto your

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.870 
paster just put a drop of oil onto your
bushes<00:01:48.380> and<00:01:49.380> then<00:01:49.680> we<00:01:49.799> can<00:01:49.979> turn<00:01:50.520> on<00:01:50.759> the

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
bushes and then we can turn on the

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.410 
bushes and then we can turn on the
machine<00:01:51.270> so<00:01:51.899> turning<00:01:52.259> on<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.470> power<00:01:52.649> supply

rubber tire we can start off at about
five<00:02:22.890> or<00:02:23.040> six<00:02:23.220> volts<00:02:23.640> we<00:02:23.730> can<00:02:23.850> always<00:02:24.090> go<00:02:24.270> if<00:02:24.480> we

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
five or six volts we can always go if we

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.880 
five or six volts we can always go if we
need<00:02:24.780> to<00:02:25.190> simply<00:02:26.190> lower<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:27.530> axle<00:02:28.530> carrier

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
need to simply lower the axle carrier

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.620 
need to simply lower the axle carrier
using<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:29.430> adjustment<00:02:29.970> screw<00:02:30.270> until<00:02:31.340> you

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
using the adjustment screw until you

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.330 
using the adjustment screw until you
you'll<00:02:33.630> actually<00:02:33.810> hear<00:02:34.350> the<00:02:34.650> motor<00:02:34.860> load<00:02:35.130> up

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
you'll actually hear the motor load up

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.060 
you'll actually hear the motor load up
when<00:02:35.520> the<00:02:35.610> tires<00:02:35.880> hit<00:02:36.330> the<00:02:36.450> abrasive<00:02:36.930> paper

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.810 

and<00:02:41.070> then<00:02:41.910> by<00:02:42.170> sliding<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.610> sanding<00:02:44.610> plate

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
and then by sliding the sanding plate

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:45.920 
and then by sliding the sanding plate
backwards<00:02:45.270> and<00:02:45.390> forwards<00:02:45.750> we<00:02:45.870> are

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
backwards and forwards we are

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.540 
backwards and forwards we are
eliminating<00:02:46.110> the<00:02:46.560> possibility<00:02:46.709> of<00:02:47.160> any<00:02:47.340> high

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
eliminating the possibility of any high

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.980 
eliminating the possibility of any high
spots<00:02:48.110> being<00:02:49.110> on<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.430> sandpaper<00:02:50.430> now<00:02:50.990> the

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
spots being on the sandpaper now the

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.020 
spots being on the sandpaper now the
trick<00:02:52.260> is<00:02:52.290> to<00:02:52.560> go<00:02:52.680> nice<00:02:52.980> and<00:02:53.010> steady<00:02:53.490> if<00:02:53.730> you<00:02:53.880> go

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
trick is to go nice and steady if you go

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.970 
trick is to go nice and steady if you go
too<00:02:54.090> hard<00:02:54.480> you'll<00:02:54.780> load<00:02:55.020> up<00:02:55.200> the<00:02:55.350> Machine<00:02:55.740> and

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
too hard you'll load up the Machine and

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.400 
too hard you'll load up the Machine and
you<00:02:56.220> overheat<00:02:56.670> your<00:02:56.760> tires<00:02:57.140> you<00:02:58.140> should<00:02:58.350> be

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
you overheat your tires you should be

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.110 
you overheat your tires you should be
able<00:02:58.470> to<00:02:58.590> sleep<00:02:58.800> rubber<00:02:59.040> being<00:02:59.340> removed<00:02:59.760> and

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
able to sleep rubber being removed and

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.170 
able to sleep rubber being removed and
by<00:03:01.050> watching<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:01.650> color<00:03:02.040> of<00:03:02.250> the<00:03:02.370> toys<00:03:02.580> I<00:03:02.940> can

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
by watching the color of the toys I can

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.350 
by watching the color of the toys I can
actually<00:03:03.330> tell<00:03:03.780> when<00:03:04.050> those<00:03:04.260> tires

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
actually tell when those tires

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.890 
actually tell when those tires
become<00:03:06.360> flat

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.990 

you<00:03:11.470> can<00:03:11.650> see<00:03:11.860> the<00:03:12.010> buildup<00:03:12.340> of<00:03:12.489> rubber<00:03:12.730> on<00:03:12.909> the

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
you can see the buildup of rubber on the

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.050 
you can see the buildup of rubber on the
machine<00:03:13.390> and<00:03:13.689> on<00:03:14.200> my<00:03:14.379> hand<00:03:14.680> so<00:03:15.040> we<00:03:15.909> know<00:03:16.030> that

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
machine and on my hand so we know that

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.899 
machine and on my hand so we know that
the<00:03:16.299> material<00:03:16.780> is<00:03:16.840> being<00:03:17.079> removed<00:03:17.760> and<00:03:18.760> once

00:03:18.899 --> 00:03:18.909 
the material is being removed and once

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:21.690 
the material is being removed and once
we<00:03:19.060> feel<00:03:19.269> that<00:03:19.420> that<00:03:19.480> tire<00:03:19.870> is<00:03:20.079> flat<00:03:20.670> we<00:03:21.670> can

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
we feel that that tire is flat we can

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.110 
we feel that that tire is flat we can
raise<00:03:22.060> the<00:03:23.069> axle<00:03:24.069> carry<00:03:24.310> it<00:03:24.459> up<00:03:24.549> and<00:03:24.760> that

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
raise the axle carry it up and that

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.140 
raise the axle carry it up and that
removes<00:03:25.510> it<00:03:25.720> from<00:03:25.750> the<00:03:25.930> abrasive<00:03:26.439> paper<00:03:27.150> now

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
removes it from the abrasive paper now

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.880 
removes it from the abrasive paper now
if<00:03:28.689> I<00:03:28.900> was<00:03:29.049> going<00:03:29.290> to<00:03:29.379> use<00:03:30.280> this<00:03:30.489> car<00:03:30.819> for

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
if I was going to use this car for

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.440 
if I was going to use this car for
racing<00:03:32.890> what<00:03:33.579> I<00:03:33.609> would<00:03:33.790> do<00:03:33.939> is<00:03:34.060> just<00:03:34.090> take<00:03:34.329> a

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
racing what I would do is just take a

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.800 
racing what I would do is just take a
nail<00:03:34.720> file<00:03:35.109> and<00:03:35.439> just<00:03:35.489> radius<00:03:36.489> off<00:03:36.730> the<00:03:37.480> edges

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
nail file and just radius off the edges

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.929 
nail file and just radius off the edges
of<00:03:37.930> the<00:03:38.049> toys<00:03:38.290> so<00:03:38.739> that<00:03:39.459> they're<00:03:39.579> not<00:03:39.670> too

00:03:39.929 --> 00:03:39.939 
of the toys so that they're not too

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:41.890 
of the toys so that they're not too
squared

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
squared

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.300 
squared
but<00:03:42.500> basically<00:03:43.390> that's<00:03:44.390> how<00:03:44.810> easy<00:03:45.709> it<00:03:45.920> is<00:03:46.010> to

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
but basically that's how easy it is to

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.240 
but basically that's how easy it is to
install<00:03:46.489> an<00:03:46.939> axle<00:03:47.390> and<00:03:47.569> sand<00:03:48.200> your<00:03:48.379> tires<00:03:48.590> on

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
install an axle and sand your tires on

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.390 
install an axle and sand your tires on
the<00:03:49.640> toilet<00:03:49.939> room<00:03:50.090> machine
