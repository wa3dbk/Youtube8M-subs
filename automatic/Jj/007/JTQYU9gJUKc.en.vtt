00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
bad soiled bathtub what I would do is I

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.200 
bad soiled bathtub what I would do is I
would<00:00:45.059> spray<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:46.430> instead<00:00:47.430> of<00:00:47.670> using<00:00:48.090> my

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
would spray it and instead of using my

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.900 
would spray it and instead of using my
sponge<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.809> wipe<00:00:48.870> it<00:00:49.170> off<00:00:49.289> I<00:00:49.590> would<00:00:50.160> take<00:00:50.489> kind

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
sponge to wipe it off I would take kind

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.660 
sponge to wipe it off I would take kind
of<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.090> rough<00:00:51.899> area<00:00:52.379> of<00:00:52.559> my<00:00:52.710> sponge<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.340> just

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
of the rough area of my sponge and just

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.540 
of the rough area of my sponge and just
go<00:00:53.820> around<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.570> just<00:00:54.710> spread<00:00:55.710> it<00:00:55.739> but<00:00:56.370> not

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
go around and just spread it but not

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.540 
go around and just spread it but not
take<00:00:56.879> it<00:00:57.000> off<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.649> I<00:00:58.649> would<00:00:58.710> leave<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.309> there

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
take it off and I would leave it there

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.299 
take it off and I would leave it there
and<00:01:00.510> I<00:01:00.780> might<00:01:01.109> leave<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.440> there<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:01.980> whole

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
and I might leave it there a whole

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.719 
and I might leave it there a whole
24-hour<00:01:02.850> period<00:01:03.559> just<00:01:04.559> so<00:01:04.799> it<00:01:04.979> will<00:01:05.159> get<00:01:05.369> in

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
24-hour period just so it will get in

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.210 
24-hour period just so it will get in
and<00:01:05.909> really<00:01:06.299> eat<00:01:06.930> away<00:01:07.110> at<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.439> stain<00:01:07.950> and

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
and really eat away at that stain and

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.620 
and really eat away at that stain and
then<00:01:08.790> I<00:01:08.850> would<00:01:09.180> come<00:01:09.479> back<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:10.110> rinse<00:01:11.630> the

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
then I would come back and rinse the

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.260 
then I would come back and rinse the
stain<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:13.409> it<00:01:13.740> usually<00:01:13.950> just<00:01:14.130> takes<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:15.119> off

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
stain and it usually just takes it off

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.789 
stain and it usually just takes it off
perfectly<00:01:16.200> if<00:01:16.830> it<00:01:17.280> is<00:01:17.549> rust<00:01:18.110> what<00:01:19.110> I<00:01:19.140> would<00:01:19.439> use

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
perfectly if it is rust what I would use

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.940 
perfectly if it is rust what I would use
is<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.610> powder<00:01:21.270> that<00:01:21.689> really<00:01:22.140> takes<00:01:22.470> away<00:01:22.799> the

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
is a powder that really takes away the

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.149 
is a powder that really takes away the
rest<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.369> do<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.580> same<00:01:23.820> thing<00:01:24.060> I<00:01:24.299> would<00:01:25.159> just

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
rest and do the same thing I would just

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.020 
rest and do the same thing I would just
sprinkle<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:26.970> powder<00:01:27.210> right<00:01:27.720> on<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:29.030> rust

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030
