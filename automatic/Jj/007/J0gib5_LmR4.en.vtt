three<00:00:32.340> different<00:00:32.850> routes<00:00:33.360> that<00:00:33.750> you<00:00:33.809> can

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
three different routes that you can

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.049 
three different routes that you can
actually<00:00:34.110> go<00:00:34.440> which<00:00:34.680> is<00:00:34.890> a<00:00:34.940> you<00:00:35.940> know

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
actually go which is a you know

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.880 
actually go which is a you know
obviously<00:00:36.300> different<00:00:36.809> routes<00:00:37.020> for<00:00:37.260> different

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
obviously different routes for different

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.760 
obviously different routes for different
events<00:00:38.219> obviously<00:00:38.850> so<00:00:39.000> you've<00:00:39.090> got<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.300> f1's

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:39.770 
events obviously so you've got the f1's

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.709 
events obviously so you've got the f1's
you've<00:00:40.770> got<00:00:41.100> what<00:00:41.760> else<00:00:41.910> they<00:00:42.210> have<00:00:42.239> they've

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
you've got what else they have they've

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.690 
you've got what else they have they've
got<00:00:42.930> all<00:00:43.079> their<00:00:43.230> own<00:00:43.410> national<00:00:43.890> stuff<00:00:44.370> over

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
got all their own national stuff over

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.190 
got all their own national stuff over
there<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:44.969> they<00:00:45.120> race<00:00:45.360> tracks<00:00:45.780> and

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
there that they race tracks and

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.869 
there that they race tracks and
obviously<00:00:46.680> you've<00:00:46.829> got<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.010> GP<00:00:47.370> circuit<00:00:47.789> as

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
obviously you've got the GP circuit as

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.729 
obviously you've got the GP circuit as
well<00:00:48.059> so<00:00:48.719> there's<00:00:48.840> three<00:00:48.930> different<00:00:49.110> ones<00:00:49.440> i

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
well so there's three different ones i

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.350 
well so there's three different ones i
won't<00:00:49.950> go<00:00:50.100> into<00:00:50.129> too<00:00:50.309> much<00:00:50.489> detail<00:00:50.640> on<00:00:51.180> the

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
won't go into too much detail on the

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.450 
won't go into too much detail on the
lengths<00:00:51.719> of<00:00:51.840> them<00:00:52.050> all<00:00:52.260> but<00:00:52.890> they're<00:00:53.309> all

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
lengths of them all but they're all

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.160 
lengths of them all but they're all
roughly<00:00:53.850> well<00:00:54.360> they're<00:00:54.750> all<00:00:54.780> they're<00:00:55.140> all

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
roughly well they're all they're all

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.099 
roughly well they're all they're all
quite<00:00:55.649> different<00:00:56.129> actually<00:00:56.219> as<00:00:56.539> 4.72<00:00:57.539> to

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
quite different actually as 4.72 to

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.740 
quite different actually as 4.72 to
point<00:00:58.469> well<00:00:59.309> 2.1<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.449> about<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.199> 1.7<00:01:02.510> mile<00:01:03.510> or

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
point well 2.1 and about a 1.7 mile or

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.560 
point well 2.1 and about a 1.7 mile or
meter<00:01:04.070> track<00:01:05.070> mile<00:01:05.640> so<00:01:05.970> it'd<00:01:06.030> be<00:01:06.150> more<00:01:06.420> than

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
meter track mile so it'd be more than

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.340 
meter track mile so it'd be more than
making<00:01:06.780> dumb<00:01:07.229> ass<00:01:07.380> meters<00:01:08.570> miles<00:01:09.570> are<00:01:09.960> so<00:01:10.290> you

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
making dumb ass meters miles are so you

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.140 
making dumb ass meters miles are so you
got<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.560> three<00:01:10.830> there<00:01:11.070> which<00:01:11.490> is<00:01:11.640> pretty<00:01:11.850> cool

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
got the three there which is pretty cool

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.780 
got the three there which is pretty cool
um<00:01:12.420> now<00:01:13.229> obviously<00:01:13.619> it's<00:01:13.770> in<00:01:13.920> I<00:01:14.189> think<00:01:14.520> it's<00:01:14.670> in

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
um now obviously it's in I think it's in

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.420 
um now obviously it's in I think it's in
Spain<00:01:15.540> this<00:01:16.080> tract<00:01:16.470> which<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:16.860> pretty<00:01:17.100> cool

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430

the straight and it's quite long I don't
know<00:01:42.420> exactly<00:01:42.899> how<00:01:43.110> long<00:01:43.350> but<00:01:43.409> it<00:01:43.649> is<00:01:43.740> quite

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
know exactly how long but it is quite

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.069 
know exactly how long but it is quite
long<00:01:44.280> into<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.700> nice<00:01:45.149> tight<00:01:45.479> left<00:01:45.750> hand

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.320 
number 10 corner coming out of the 16th
turn<00:01:49.979> you've<00:01:50.909> got<00:01:51.149> an<00:01:51.299> extremely<00:01:51.780> long

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
turn you've got an extremely long

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.570 
turn you've got an extremely long
long<00:01:53.450> straight<00:01:54.200> which<00:01:54.470> comes<00:01:54.770> to<00:01:55.010> really

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 
long straight which comes to really

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.600 
long straight which comes to really
pretty<00:01:56.000> much<00:01:56.240> a<00:01:56.270> 90-degree<00:01:56.990> turn<00:01:57.020> in<00:01:57.610> quickly

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
pretty much a 90-degree turn in quickly

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.280 
pretty much a 90-degree turn in quickly
back<00:01:58.790> over<00:01:59.090> the<00:01:59.180> other<00:01:59.300> way<00:01:59.510> as<00:01:59.690> well<00:01:59.720> so<00:02:00.170> it's

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
back over the other way as well so it's

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:01.810 
back over the other way as well so it's
quite<00:02:00.560> a<00:02:00.620> little<00:02:00.770> tight<00:02:01.070> section<00:02:01.460> towards<00:02:01.760> the

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
quite a little tight section towards the

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.390 
quite a little tight section towards the
end<00:02:01.940> and<00:02:02.090> you<00:02:02.240> can<00:02:02.510> just<00:02:02.930> imagine<00:02:03.200> coming<00:02:04.190> into

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 
end and you can just imagine coming into

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.490 
end and you can just imagine coming into
it<00:02:04.520> too<00:02:04.760> fast<00:02:04.790> you're<00:02:05.750> going<00:02:05.810> to<00:02:05.990> hit<00:02:06.110> straight

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
it too fast you're going to hit straight

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.440 
it too fast you're going to hit straight
into<00:02:06.680> the<00:02:06.710> dirt<00:02:07.040> and<00:02:07.250> come<00:02:07.790> with<00:02:07.910> gutter<00:02:08.149> which

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
into the dirt and come with gutter which

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.050 
into the dirt and come with gutter which
isn't<00:02:08.690> much<00:02:08.720> fun<00:02:09.550> fortunately<00:02:10.550> i<00:02:10.580> don't<00:02:10.850> think

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.190 
track on the GP box as well in the game
and<00:02:15.740> it's<00:02:16.100> a<00:02:16.250> lot<00:02:16.460> different<00:02:16.670> um<00:02:17.090> I've<00:02:17.660> played

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.810 
and it's a lot different um I've played
a<00:02:18.230> couple<00:02:18.800> online<00:02:19.130> games<00:02:19.370> last<00:02:19.610> night

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
a couple online games last night

actually played on this track and the

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.860 
actually played on this track and the
breaking<00:02:22.400> points<00:02:22.850> are<00:02:22.970> completely<00:02:23.480> different

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
breaking points are completely different

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.690 
breaking points are completely different
like<00:02:23.990> on<00:02:24.140> the<00:02:24.200> 125<00:02:24.770> you<00:02:24.950> can<00:02:25.100> break<00:02:25.280> a<00:02:25.310> lot

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
like on the 125 you can break a lot

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.100 
like on the 125 you can break a lot
later<00:02:26.000> because<00:02:26.210> of<00:02:26.330> box<00:02:26.540> a<00:02:26.660> lot<00:02:26.810> smaller

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
later because of box a lot smaller

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.500 
later because of box a lot smaller

i do pretty good in this one guys third
again<00:03:45.320> i<00:03:45.560> could<00:03:45.980> have<00:03:46.070> possibly<00:03:46.310> pulled

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
again i could have possibly pulled

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.420 
again i could have possibly pulled
second<00:03:47.269> butter<00:03:47.540> I've<00:03:47.900> failed<00:03:48.590> to<00:03:48.950> take<00:03:49.190> the

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
second butter I've failed to take the

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.729 
second butter I've failed to take the
last<00:03:49.670> turn<00:03:50.180> properly<00:03:50.810> if<00:03:51.019> I<00:03:51.110> had<00:03:51.290> have<00:03:51.380> taken

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
last turn properly if I had have taken

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:53.560 
last turn properly if I had have taken
the<00:03:51.799> right<00:03:52.010> line<00:03:52.340> I<00:03:52.580> think<00:03:53.060> I<00:03:53.150> probably<00:03:53.330> would

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
the right line I think I probably would

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.870 
the right line I think I probably would
have<00:03:53.630> shot<00:03:53.900> up<00:03:54.019> into<00:03:54.470> second<00:03:55.100> and<00:03:55.220> probably<00:03:55.700> I

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
have shot up into second and probably I

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.370 
have shot up into second and probably I
would<00:03:56.090> have<00:03:56.209> had<00:03:56.330> to<00:03:56.420> try<00:03:56.720> to<00:03:56.780> hold<00:03:57.080> him<00:03:57.260> off

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
would have had to try to hold him off

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.320 
would have had to try to hold him off
but<00:03:57.650> I<00:03:57.860> think<00:03:58.489> I<00:03:58.549> was<00:03:58.700> even<00:03:58.820> with<00:03:59.000> a<00:03:59.060> bit<00:03:59.180> of<00:03:59.209> a

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
but I think I was even with a bit of a

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:00.520 
but I think I was even with a bit of a
chance<00:03:59.570> i<00:03:59.720> probably<00:04:00.019> could<00:04:00.260> have<00:04:00.290> done<00:04:00.500> it

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
chance i probably could have done it

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:01.190 
chance i probably could have done it
unfor

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
unfor

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.380 
unfor
may<00:04:01.319> I<00:04:01.349> took<00:04:02.250> the<00:04:02.400> wrong<00:04:02.550> line<00:04:02.819> into<00:04:03.150> it<00:04:03.270> and

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
may I took the wrong line into it and

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.089 
may I took the wrong line into it and
actually<00:04:03.870> ran<00:04:04.170> in<00:04:04.290> the<00:04:04.379> back<00:04:04.530> of<00:04:04.680> second<00:04:04.980> guy

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099 
actually ran in the back of second guy

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:07.130 
actually ran in the back of second guy
which<00:04:05.310> pushed<00:04:05.640> him<00:04:05.819> further<00:04:06.090> further<00:04:06.810> further

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
which pushed him further further further

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.430 
which pushed him further further further
further<00:04:08.209> well<00:04:09.209> Jays<00:04:09.629> can't<00:04:09.959> even<00:04:10.140> speak

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
further well Jays can't even speak

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.220 
further well Jays can't even speak
further<00:04:11.220> ahead<00:04:11.550> and<00:04:11.910> I<00:04:12.450> had<00:04:12.660> no<00:04:12.810> chance<00:04:13.019> of

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
further ahead and I had no chance of

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.140 
further ahead and I had no chance of
catching<00:04:13.440> him<00:04:13.709> after<00:04:13.950> that<00:04:13.980> so<00:04:14.459> it's<00:04:15.000> a<00:04:15.030> bit<00:04:15.120> of

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
catching him after that so it's a bit of

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.090 
catching him after that so it's a bit of
a<00:04:15.269> fail<00:04:15.480> but<00:04:15.510> it<00:04:15.780> was<00:04:15.870> good<00:04:16.049> effort<00:04:16.380> and<00:04:16.530> to<00:04:16.950> get

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
a fail but it was good effort and to get

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.830 
a fail but it was good effort and to get
a<00:04:17.130> third<00:04:17.430> position<00:04:17.850> was<00:04:18.000> good<00:04:18.209> on<00:04:18.450> a<00:04:18.510> track

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
a third position was good on a track

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.479 
a third position was good on a track
that<00:04:18.870> I<00:04:19.019> haven't<00:04:19.169> really<00:04:19.410> raced<00:04:19.769> too<00:04:20.280> much

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
that I haven't really raced too much
