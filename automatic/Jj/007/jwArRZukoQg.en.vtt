00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.829
 we have very big goals 

00:00:09.829 --> 00:00:12.479
 I do not mind that end on 

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:14.249
 surrender from Poland delivered play 

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:16.409
 only a good game can be tightened 

00:00:16.409 --> 00:00:18.539
 sold that stadium under this we will 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.209
 engage the edge assessment all these teams 

00:00:21.209 --> 00:00:23.479
 achieve something if i saw again 

00:00:23.479 --> 00:00:24.550
 I repeat that 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:25.930
 there is not only if cues 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.150
 work in it will not be able to disgrace this 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:29.960
 yourself and so on 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.210
 I see about it 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.440
 and more I will say goa sure that 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.440
 the future of these teams 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.780
 many questions 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.600
 many questions this is nothing i would take in 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.090
 assets 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.330
 but the quality of the game certainly leaves 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.330
 want something better 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.830
 you see what the problems of power 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.810
 just in position 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.320
 but such games for us were very 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.020
 are attentive 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:05.730
 we will work to ensure that these 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.480
 problems how to solve 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.910
 naturally due to 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:10.570
 our local resources 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.710
 we can not invite 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.750
 but I wonâ€™t call anyone 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.320
 can we invited because they don't 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.320
 Ukrainians 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.870
 first thing of course 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.470
 game in defense 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.590
 20 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.960
 in twos allows the team 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.840
 rival 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.620
 so easy to get our people is of course m 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.620
 bad and as for 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.840
 aggression 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.030
 settings 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.030
 in attack 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.619
 unfortunately for today 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:59.100
 to date 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.570
 we select tactics for the players they are the trench 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.220
 tactics and I liked this one 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.910
 football player in the locker room 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:06.670
 some eyes lowered a little 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.549
 was ashamed 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:10.819
 I think that hours because I kind of 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:12.649
 psychologically 

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:15.019
 so ready no so the Brazilian often is 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:18.019
 it seems no 

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:24.539
 you know 

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:26.769
 potential 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:28.559
 in these guys both teams 

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:30.809
 previously there was integrity yes starts 

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:32.379
 Were not bad We were not failed 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:34.229
 We show Russian men so 

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:36.039
 said in his penalty for some reason not 

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:36.899
 beaten 

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:38.099
 without interference 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.479
 inattention 

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:42.829
 and for this it is necessary to tear off was busy laid out
