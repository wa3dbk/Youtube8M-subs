jail<00:02:55.430> started<00:02:56.430> something<00:02:56.730> which<00:02:57.600> is<00:02:57.870> a

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
jail started something which is a

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.390 
jail started something which is a
nucleus<00:02:59.459> and<00:02:59.870> I<00:03:00.870> have<00:03:01.050> no<00:03:01.230> idea<00:03:01.709> what<00:03:02.250> the

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
nucleus and I have no idea what the

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.340 
nucleus and I have no idea what the
outcome<00:03:02.430> would<00:03:02.970> be<00:03:03.000> quite<00:03:03.630> different<00:03:03.840> to<00:03:04.200> the

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
outcome would be quite different to the

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.250 
outcome would be quite different to the
Western<00:03:04.970> concept<00:03:05.970> of<00:03:06.150> having<00:03:06.330> a<00:03:06.540> sketch<00:03:06.840> and

Western concept of having a sketch and

then<00:03:08.070> you<00:03:08.250> add<00:03:08.519> and<00:03:09.060> you<00:03:09.180> make<00:03:09.630> this<00:03:10.170> and<00:03:10.410> that

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
then you add and you make this and that

no I start with the nucleus which is

no I start with the nucleus which is
