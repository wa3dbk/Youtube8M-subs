00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 in the beauty gallery term that aek to 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.620
 you again with an easy tip 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.960
 maybe you have this doubt with 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.190
 many people ask me how I do it 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.950
 the chicken 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.789
 I usually clean the chicken already in 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.130
 bag is as if I already saw I cleaned chicken 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:22.470
 place in the pan a small 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.680
 cut into pieces and place inside the 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.680
 pan 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.140
 It depends if I had the chicken dry myself too 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.510
 I put water on it if it does not dry 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.600
 I leave with water that is there that a 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.460
 nice water at the beginning I put the 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:43.620
 glass in spices are at home here 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:46.500
 onion there the pepper whatever it takes 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.739
 base whatever you have here in the closet 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.750
 I do not have anything specific 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:53.850
 So I created this neat needle. 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.739
 water it creates showing us 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.770
 willingness to show that the chicken is 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.379
 here I observed the state has a water nÃ© 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.210
 a needle and I already have mine here 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.710
 I'm going to take logic that only 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.710
 an example for you to see 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.799
 so what I do is the basics are you 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:14.070
 catch water is on your chicken 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:17.070
 water you left there and put a 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.479
 spoonful of water that has a 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.740
 little spice to have a little of 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.180
 Query 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.950
 so you do not eat a meal 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.740
 very tasteless 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:29.100
 course I'd rather eat a block him 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.020
 with taste of this than ate block in the 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.450
 scenario also if you have nothing 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.689
 have had a taste of time but it is a tip 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.670
 you may have trouble eating the 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.740
 Your block to eat your food 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.140
 maybe you do not like the 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.880
 food and a tip for you to use 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.790
 caldinho maybe put a little more 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.680
 water and then it will give you a broth 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.350
 add in other foods over 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.149
 to give that tasty but bottle 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.100
 for you so that you have liked and 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.920
 I'll be right back here right now. 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:06.940
 channel on this webb had the 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:10.509
 I have in my head in the hospital in 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.509
