burn an extra 400 calories just while

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.500 
burn an extra 400 calories just while
you're<00:01:06.990> sleeping<00:01:07.470> so<00:01:07.640> for<00:01:08.640> half<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.210> kilo<00:01:09.390> of

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
you're sleeping so for half a kilo of

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.960 
you're sleeping so for half a kilo of
fat<00:01:09.810> it<00:01:10.020> only<00:01:10.200> burns<00:01:10.409> one<00:01:10.710> two<00:01:10.860> three<00:01:11.070> calories

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
fat it only burns one two three calories

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.700 
fat it only burns one two three calories
just<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.390> sustain<00:01:12.570> itself<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.530> most

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
just to sustain itself and the most

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.620 
just to sustain itself and the most
important<00:01:14.130> thing<00:01:14.250> I<00:01:14.340> think<00:01:14.369> is<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:14.850> it

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
important thing I think is that it

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.240 
important thing I think is that it
prevents<00:01:16.049> you<00:01:16.140> from<00:01:16.170> gaining<00:01:16.680> weight<00:01:16.890> as<00:01:17.070> you

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
prevents you from gaining weight as you

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.120 
prevents you from gaining weight as you
age<00:01:17.430> because<00:01:18.330> after<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.780> age<00:01:18.869> of<00:01:18.990> 35<00:01:19.530> we<00:01:19.920> lose

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
age because after the age of 35 we lose

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.929 
age because after the age of 35 we lose
5%<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:21.030> our<00:01:21.180> muscle<00:01:21.720> mass<00:01:21.750> every<00:01:22.140> 10<00:01:22.619> years<00:01:22.939> so

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
5% of our muscle mass every 10 years so

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.510 
5% of our muscle mass every 10 years so
if<00:01:24.299> you<00:01:24.600> don't<00:01:24.810> rebuild<00:01:25.470> that<00:01:25.650> muscle<00:01:26.100> then

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
if you don't rebuild that muscle then

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.249 
if you don't rebuild that muscle then
the<00:01:26.880> calories<00:01:27.299> that<00:01:27.390> that<00:01:27.600> muscle<00:01:27.900> will<00:01:28.020> burn

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
the calories that that muscle will burn

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.960 
the calories that that muscle will burn
that's<00:01:28.710> what<00:01:28.920> gets<00:01:29.130> sought<00:01:29.340> so<00:01:29.520> that's<00:01:29.700> why<00:01:29.820> we

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
that's what gets sought so that's why we

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.140 
that's what gets sought so that's why we
put<00:01:30.930> on<00:01:31.049> weight<00:01:31.229> as<00:01:31.380> we<00:01:31.560> age<00:01:31.740> so<00:01:32.549> it's<00:01:32.790> really

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
put on weight as we age so it's really

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.999 
put on weight as we age so it's really
important<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:33.960> I<00:01:34.170> want<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.409> show<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:34.650> some
