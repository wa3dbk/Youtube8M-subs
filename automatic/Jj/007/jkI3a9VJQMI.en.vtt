00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
all that and obviously it would be a

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.090 
all that and obviously it would be a
steal<00:00:41.010> with<00:00:41.940> this<00:00:42.120> service<00:00:42.360> compared<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.469> the

thirty<00:00:49.230> dollars<00:00:49.559> per<00:00:49.770> month<00:00:50.010> so<00:00:50.809> today<00:00:51.809> be<00:00:52.079> and

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
thirty dollars per month so today be and

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
on it and and possibly even just

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.510
