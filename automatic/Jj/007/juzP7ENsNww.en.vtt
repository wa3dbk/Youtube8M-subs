00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
says to do that in the program

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.729 
says to do that in the program
guidelines<00:00:41.670> why<00:00:42.390> because<00:00:43.140> when<00:00:43.260> you<00:00:43.350> exercise

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
guidelines why because when you exercise

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.380 
guidelines why because when you exercise
you'll<00:00:44.100> lose<00:00:44.250> calories<00:00:44.520> you're<00:00:45.239> on<00:00:45.360> a

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
you'll lose calories you're on a

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.810 
you'll lose calories you're on a
low-calorie<00:00:45.870> diet<00:00:46.410> anyway<00:00:46.800> so<00:00:46.950> why<00:00:47.550> would<00:00:47.730> you

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
low-calorie diet anyway so why would you

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:48.920 
low-calorie diet anyway so why would you
want<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.030> stick<00:00:48.210> yourself<00:00:48.510> into<00:00:48.690> starvation

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
want to stick yourself into starvation

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.360 
want to stick yourself into starvation
not<00:00:49.530> too<00:00:49.770> smart<00:00:50.480> secondly<00:00:51.480> water<00:00:51.840> intake

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
not too smart secondly water intake

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.910 
not too smart secondly water intake
whitewater<00:00:53.539> guess<00:00:54.539> what<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:55.410> need<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.680> drink

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
whitewater guess what you need to drink

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.160 
whitewater guess what you need to drink
it<00:00:56.070> because<00:00:56.250> your<00:00:56.520> fat<00:00:56.699> molecules<00:00:57.210> stick<00:00:57.899> to

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
it because your fat molecules stick to

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.779 
it because your fat molecules stick to
the<00:00:58.260> water<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:58.800> that's<00:00:59.100> how<00:00:59.280> they<00:00:59.430> leave<00:00:59.609> your

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
the water and that's how they leave your

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.660 
the water and that's how they leave your
body<00:01:00.440> so<00:01:02.180> get<00:01:03.180> yourself<00:01:03.510> one<00:01:03.570> of<00:01:03.629> these<00:01:04.670> and

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
body so get yourself one of these and

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.149 
body so get yourself one of these and
get<00:01:05.970> yourself<00:01:06.330> some<00:01:06.510> of<00:01:06.659> these<00:01:06.900> or<00:01:07.710> whatever

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
get yourself some of these or whatever

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.550 
get yourself some of these or whatever
kind<00:01:08.369> of<00:01:08.520> water<00:01:08.640> flavor<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.119> like<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.810> drink
