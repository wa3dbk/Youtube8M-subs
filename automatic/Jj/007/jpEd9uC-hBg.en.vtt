00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.720
 well I'm here for a 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.750
 demonstration with the people who asked 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:11.790
 how do you put the chipped stone in this 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:13.740
 I would then look for quick tips on 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.170
 people who have already put the stones 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.260
 day before putting the floor in 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.260
 porcelain tile 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.840
 how can you see the members there 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.050
 everything in line does not even have to 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.599
 Mirror I made a thin flour because of 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.120
 of the skin of two centimeters and 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.579
 porcelanato has a snag I'm going to give a 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.860
 I've left a step that more or 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:42.750
 less put you have a notion 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.640
 when you put the stone in the way 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.170
 if here I put a stone one 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.050
 little bigger 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.730
 I made a hole in the wall to deliver 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.500
 better make more safety about the 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.969
 stone does not need it but it is 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:00.300
 good to have more security in case 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:03.690
 I used a bad line that more or 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:08.760
 one and a half centimeters 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:11.760
 size of the porcelain tile with the size 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:17.820
 porcelain tile with the mortar I put there 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:21.720
 under the stone is this space left in the 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:27.720
 and a level that is important is not 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:32.490
 on both sides and for 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:36.020
 here we will take the porcelain tile and the 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:40.740
 mirror the mirror will give the finish 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:43.979
 above the threshold take over 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.880
 any small pieces of flooring goes 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.880
 stay the beautiful wedding 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:55.079
 so here for you that a nation the 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:59.760
 stones are well placed and I go 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:03.010
