okay if we're going to take a vision the

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.690 
okay if we're going to take a vision the
tape<00:00:09.809> we<00:00:10.050> use<00:00:10.200> a<00:00:10.230> soft<00:00:10.620> tape<00:00:10.980> so<00:00:11.370> that<00:00:11.580> will

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
tape we use a soft tape so that will

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.180 
tape we use a soft tape so that will
conform<00:00:12.120> with<00:00:12.360> the<00:00:12.570> head<00:00:12.870> put<00:00:13.500> it<00:00:13.620> just<00:00:13.830> above

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
conform with the head put it just above

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.460 
conform with the head put it just above
the<00:00:14.250> ears<00:00:14.730> and<00:00:15.120> across<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.630> forehead

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
the ears and across the forehead

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.609 
the ears and across the forehead
this<00:00:17.190> measure<00:00:17.490> is<00:00:17.690> 56<00:00:18.690> and<00:00:19.109> a<00:00:19.170> bit<00:00:20.029> 56

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:21.619 
this measure is 56 and a bit 56

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.880 
this measure is 56 and a bit 56
centimeters<00:00:22.619> so<00:00:22.859> it's<00:00:23.010> a<00:00:23.070> size<00:00:23.310> 56<00:00:24.180> hat<00:00:24.890> Mike

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
centimeters so it's a size 56 hat Mike

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.450 
centimeters so it's a size 56 hat Mike
will<00:00:26.189> try<00:00:26.609> on<00:00:26.849> some<00:00:27.180> apps<00:00:27.420> and<00:00:28.130> put<00:00:29.130> them<00:00:29.279> on

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
will try on some apps and put them on

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.730 
will try on some apps and put them on
just<00:00:29.910> so<00:00:30.090> they're<00:00:30.300> comfortable<00:00:30.599> we'll<00:00:31.470> try

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
just so they're comfortable we'll try

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.420 
just so they're comfortable we'll try
one<00:00:32.219> that's<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.669> size<00:00:33.149> 55<00:00:34.020> which<00:00:34.410> is<00:00:34.620> smaller

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
one that's a size 55 which is smaller

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.150 
one that's a size 55 which is smaller
than<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:36.239> measurement<00:00:36.600> indicates<00:00:37.200> if<00:00:37.980> you

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
than the measurement indicates if you

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.799 
than the measurement indicates if you
put<00:00:38.370> it<00:00:38.489> on<00:00:38.670> just<00:00:39.120> where<00:00:39.390> it's<00:00:39.510> comfortable

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
put it on just where it's comfortable

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.590 
put it on just where it's comfortable
not<00:00:40.350> tight<00:00:40.710> then<00:00:41.670> you<00:00:41.879> see<00:00:42.149> that<00:00:42.390> this<00:00:42.540> is

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
not tight then you see that this is

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.490 
not tight then you see that this is
riding<00:00:43.230> high<00:00:43.500> above<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.100> ears<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:45.289> high<00:00:46.289> on

riding high above the ears and high on

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.369 
riding high above the ears and high on
the<00:00:46.649> forehead<00:00:47.210> it's<00:00:48.210> going<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.600> be<00:00:48.719> insecure

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
the forehead it's going to be insecure

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.150 
the forehead it's going to be insecure
and<00:00:49.710> it<00:00:50.700> doesn't<00:00:51.059> look<00:00:51.239> right<00:00:51.500> now<00:00:52.500> let's<00:00:52.920> try

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
and it doesn't look right now let's try

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.430 
and it doesn't look right now let's try
on<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.730> one<00:00:54.149> that<00:00:54.360> one<00:00:54.750> that's<00:00:54.989> too<00:00:55.230> big<00:00:56.660> 57<00:00:57.660> this

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
on a one that one that's too big 57 this

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.290 
on a one that one that's too big 57 this
comes<00:00:58.770> down<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.309> pushes<00:00:59.670> on<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.030> ears

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
comes down and pushes on the ears

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.579 
comes down and pushes on the ears
obviously<00:01:01.289> too<00:01:01.920> big<00:01:02.160> all<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.730> way<00:01:02.969> around<00:01:03.589> if

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
obviously too big all the way around if

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.910 
obviously too big all the way around if
we<00:01:04.710> go<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:05.070> 56<00:01:06.110> which<00:01:07.110> is<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.590> correct<00:01:08.340> size

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
we go to a 56 which is the correct size

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.440 
we go to a 56 which is the correct size
when<00:01:10.920> it's<00:01:11.100> comfortable<00:01:11.520> it's<00:01:11.850> just<00:01:12.180> above

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
when it's comfortable it's just above

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.490 
when it's comfortable it's just above
the<00:01:12.630> ears<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.200> fits

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
the ears and fits

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.899 
the ears and fits
now<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.979> best<00:01:17.220> way<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.790> try<00:01:18.570> on<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.810> hat<00:01:19.729> to<00:01:20.729> get

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
now the best way to try on a hat to get

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.950 
now the best way to try on a hat to get
the<00:01:21.090> size<00:01:21.299> is<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.930> take<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.170> soft<00:01:22.680> fur<00:01:23.100> felt<00:01:23.960> such

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
the size is to take a soft fur felt such

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.030 
the size is to take a soft fur felt such
as<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.290> Sydney<00:01:25.680> fedora<00:01:26.070> where<00:01:26.790> there<00:01:27.350> the<00:01:28.350> Hat

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
as the Sydney fedora where there the Hat

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.370 
as the Sydney fedora where there the Hat
can<00:01:29.369> conform<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.180> your<00:01:30.270> head<00:01:30.570> shape<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.229> other

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
can conform to your head shape the other

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.069 
can conform to your head shape the other
factor<00:01:31.920> of<00:01:32.009> fitting<00:01:32.340> is<00:01:32.460> not<00:01:32.670> just<00:01:32.939> size<00:01:33.180> but

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
factor of fitting is not just size but

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.490 
factor of fitting is not just size but
the<00:01:34.290> oval<00:01:34.890> this<00:01:35.390> oval<00:01:36.390> where<00:01:36.600> it<00:01:36.750> fits<00:01:36.990> on

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
the oval this oval where it fits on

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.580 
the oval this oval where it fits on
heads<00:01:38.190> differ<00:01:38.630> so<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:39.690> have<00:01:40.050> to<00:01:40.230> have<00:01:40.350> one

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
heads differ so you have to have one

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.310 
heads differ so you have to have one
that<00:01:40.770> will<00:01:40.920> adapt<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.670> soft<00:01:42.000> Sydney<00:01:42.690> will

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
that will adapt and the soft Sydney will

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.630 
that will adapt and the soft Sydney will
adapt<00:01:43.650> to<00:01:43.680> your<00:01:43.980> head<00:01:44.340> shape<00:01:45.530> they<00:01:46.530> all<00:01:47.280> look

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
adapt to your head shape they all look

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.160 
adapt to your head shape they all look
better<00:01:47.880> when<00:01:48.120> they<00:01:48.240> have<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.390> little<00:01:48.690> crease<00:01:48.960> in

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
better when they have a little crease in

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.170 
better when they have a little crease in
it<00:01:49.290> why<00:01:49.950> don't<00:01:50.160> you<00:01:50.280> put<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.490> crease<00:01:50.790> in<00:01:51.000> that

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
it why don't you put a crease in that

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:59.870 
it why don't you put a crease in that
take<00:01:52.110> it<00:01:52.260> down<00:01:55.160> the<00:01:56.160> traditional<00:01:58.880> Fedora

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
take it down the traditional Fedora

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.380 
take it down the traditional Fedora
crease<00:02:00.330> was<00:02:00.720> just<00:02:01.020> a<00:02:01.200> simple<00:02:01.970> grease<00:02:02.970> on<00:02:03.240> the

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
crease was just a simple grease on the

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.840 
crease was just a simple grease on the
top<00:02:03.630> a<00:02:03.990> couple<00:02:04.619> of<00:02:04.680> dents<00:02:05.070> in<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.340> front<00:02:05.580> turn

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
top a couple of dents in the front turn

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.169 
top a couple of dents in the front turn
down<00:02:06.150> makes<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:06.990> major<00:02:07.710> difference<00:02:08.039> with<00:02:09.000> the

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
down makes a major difference with the

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.240 
down makes a major difference with the
Sun<00:02:09.390> with<00:02:09.750> it<00:02:09.929> ungreased<00:02:10.410> we<00:02:10.679> can<00:02:10.890> show<00:02:11.070> the

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
Sun with it ungreased we can show the

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.660 
Sun with it ungreased we can show the
size<00:02:11.489> if<00:02:11.930> your<00:02:12.930> hat<00:02:13.110> is<00:02:13.350> just<00:02:13.380> a<00:02:13.800> little<00:02:14.100> too

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
size if your hat is just a little too

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.650 
size if your hat is just a little too
big<00:02:14.910> for<00:02:15.209> you<00:02:15.770> then<00:02:16.770> you<00:02:16.950> can<00:02:17.160> use<00:02:17.370> padding<00:02:17.970> to

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
big for you then you can use padding to

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.570 
big for you then you can use padding to
Pat<00:02:19.020> it<00:02:19.230> up<00:02:19.380> by<00:02:19.650> putting<00:02:19.890> felt<00:02:20.280> tape

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
Pat it up by putting felt tape

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.570 
Pat it up by putting felt tape
underneath<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.600> sweat<00:02:22.080> band<00:02:22.380> if<00:02:22.650> it's<00:02:23.340> a

little loose at the sides compared to
the<00:02:25.739> front<00:02:26.040> you<00:02:26.700> can<00:02:26.910> fill<00:02:27.150> in<00:02:27.300> the<00:02:27.450> sides<00:02:27.720> with
