00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.029
 little unpacking packages in 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.730
 of highway chan then I got one 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.769
 small and we will start with the most 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.930
 big because there are more things and 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.230
 the smallest and the most important for 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.990
 me 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:34.309
 so we start right away with the 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:40.739
 big package then there is a 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:45.469

 I saw I invested in a cutter that 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.539
 do not do much more since I 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.610
 do not use them very often then it's 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:11.250

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:14.189

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.610
