groups on contraction you can see that

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.139 
groups on contraction you can see that
she<00:00:36.250> has<00:00:36.400> lines<00:00:36.670> here<00:00:37.090> on<00:00:37.239> the<00:00:37.750> forehead<00:00:38.020> and

when she relaxes her muscles those
wrinkles<00:00:46.270> remain<00:00:46.800> both<00:00:47.800> here<00:00:48.190> and<00:00:48.370> here<00:00:48.700> and

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
wrinkles remain both here and here and

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.910 
wrinkles remain both here and here and
there<00:00:49.239> are<00:00:49.329> also<00:00:49.420> some<00:00:49.899> around<00:00:50.800> the

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920 
there are also some around the

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.119 
there are also some around the
periorbital<00:00:51.190> region<00:00:52.530> when<00:00:53.530> assessing<00:00:53.860> a

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:54.129 
periorbital region when assessing a

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:56.069 
periorbital region when assessing a
patient's<00:00:54.579> face<00:00:54.789> it<00:00:55.059> is<00:00:55.180> also<00:00:55.360> important<00:00:56.020> to

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:56.079 
patient's face it is also important to

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:59.580 
patient's face it is also important to
take<00:00:56.199> note<00:00:56.620> of<00:00:56.649> any<00:00:56.980> asymmetry<00:00:58.050> some<00:00:59.050> patients

00:00:59.580 --> 00:00:59.590 
take note of any asymmetry some patients

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.439 
take note of any asymmetry some patients
may<00:00:59.710> have<00:00:59.890> more<00:01:00.129> wrinkles<00:01:00.370> on<00:01:00.789> a<00:01:00.820> particular

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:01.449 
may have more wrinkles on a particular

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:03.240 
may have more wrinkles on a particular
side<00:01:01.690> of<00:01:01.840> their<00:01:01.989> face<00:01:02.199> than<00:01:02.469> on<00:01:02.590> the<00:01:02.739> other<00:01:02.890> and

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
side of their face than on the other and

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.420 
side of their face than on the other and
this<00:01:04.149> is<00:01:04.360> particularly<00:01:04.930> important<00:01:05.860> when<00:01:06.130> you

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
this is particularly important when you

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.840 
this is particularly important when you
are<00:01:06.460> assessing<00:01:07.420> for<00:01:07.720> an<00:01:07.960> eyebrow<00:01:08.530> droop<00:01:09.159> or<00:01:09.340> if

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
are assessing for an eyebrow droop or if

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.850 
are assessing for an eyebrow droop or if
you're<00:01:10.060> attempting<00:01:10.750> to<00:01:10.780> create<00:01:11.200> an<00:01:11.560> eyebrow

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
you're attempting to create an eyebrow

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.270 
you're attempting to create an eyebrow
lift<00:01:12.310> a<00:01:13.080> patient<00:01:14.080> may<00:01:14.290> have<00:01:14.320> one<00:01:15.070> eyebrow

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
lift a patient may have one eyebrow

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.399 
lift a patient may have one eyebrow
slightly<00:01:16.000> lower<00:01:16.180> down<00:01:16.570> and<00:01:16.930> the<00:01:17.170> other<00:01:17.320> one

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:17.409 
slightly lower down and the other one

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:19.020 
slightly lower down and the other one
and<00:01:17.830> then<00:01:18.189> we<00:01:18.310> would<00:01:18.460> need<00:01:18.610> to<00:01:18.790> administer

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
and then we would need to administer

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.630 
and then we would need to administer
more<00:01:19.630> anti<00:01:20.320> wrinkle<00:01:20.439> treatment<00:01:21.009> on<00:01:21.130> this<00:01:21.369> side

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
more anti wrinkle treatment on this side

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.320 
more anti wrinkle treatment on this side
than<00:01:22.000> on<00:01:22.030> the<00:01:22.180> other<00:01:22.420> side<00:01:23.670> this<00:01:24.670> particular

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
than on the other side this particular

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.840 
than on the other side this particular
patient<00:01:25.570> seems<00:01:26.110> to<00:01:26.290> have<00:01:26.439> fairly<00:01:26.860> symmetrical

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
patient seems to have fairly symmetrical

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.300 
patient seems to have fairly symmetrical
wrinkles<00:01:28.689> if<00:01:29.320> you'd<00:01:29.530> like<00:01:29.680> to<00:01:29.830> elevate<00:01:30.220> your

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
wrinkles if you'd like to elevate your

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.760 
wrinkles if you'd like to elevate your
eyebrows<00:01:30.729> please<00:01:31.060> as<00:01:31.330> you<00:01:32.259> can<00:01:32.439> see<00:01:32.619> the

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
eyebrows please as you can see the

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.410 
eyebrows please as you can see the
forehead<00:01:33.159> is<00:01:33.310> wrinkling<00:01:33.790> fairly

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
forehead is wrinkling fairly

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.390 
forehead is wrinkling fairly
symmetrically<00:01:35.170> and<00:01:35.380> therefore<00:01:36.040> we<00:01:36.159> will<00:01:36.280> be

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.400 
symmetrically and therefore we will be

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.039 
symmetrically and therefore we will be
administering<00:01:36.939> the<00:01:37.090> product<00:01:37.509> evenly

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:38.049 
administering the product evenly

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:41.520 
administering the product evenly
throughout<00:01:38.470> the<00:01:38.770> frontalis<00:01:39.340> muscle<00:01:40.380> she<00:01:41.380> also

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
throughout the frontalis muscle she also

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.999 
throughout the frontalis muscle she also
has<00:01:41.860> a<00:01:41.890> fairly<00:01:42.340> symmetrical<00:01:43.030> frown<00:01:43.390> as<00:01:44.009> you

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
has a fairly symmetrical frown as you

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:46.469 
has a fairly symmetrical frown as you
can<00:01:45.159> see<00:01:45.369> there<00:01:45.549> are<00:01:45.640> two<00:01:45.790> quite<00:01:46.030> strong

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
can see there are two quite strong

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:48.179 
can see there are two quite strong
wrinkles<00:01:46.750> here<00:01:47.259> so<00:01:47.500> therefore<00:01:47.710> we'll<00:01:48.070> be

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:48.189 
wrinkles here so therefore we'll be

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:51.510 
wrinkles here so therefore we'll be
injecting<00:01:48.729> the<00:01:49.509> same<00:01:49.780> on<00:01:49.960> both<00:01:49.990> sides<00:01:50.520> so

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
injecting the same on both sides so

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.889 
injecting the same on both sides so
there<00:01:51.700> isn't<00:01:51.820> any<00:01:52.030> asymmetry<00:01:52.659> in<00:01:52.750> this

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 
there isn't any asymmetry in this

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:54.480 
there isn't any asymmetry in this
particular<00:01:53.439> patient<00:01:53.680> but<00:01:54.040> it<00:01:54.130> is<00:01:54.250> something

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
particular patient but it is something

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.719 
particular patient but it is something
that<00:01:54.640> we<00:01:54.939> need<00:01:55.090> to<00:01:55.210> be<00:01:55.360> aware<00:01:55.600> of<00:01:56.520> if<00:01:57.520> you'd

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
that we need to be aware of if you'd

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:00.090 
that we need to be aware of if you'd
like<00:01:57.880> to<00:01:58.060> raise<00:01:58.240> your<00:01:58.450> eyes<00:01:58.710> having<00:01:59.710> a<00:01:59.799> look<00:01:59.950> at

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
like to raise your eyes having a look at

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.639 
like to raise your eyes having a look at
the<00:02:00.189> front<00:02:00.430> a<00:02:00.610> list<00:02:00.850> muscle<00:02:01.210> here<00:02:01.509> we<00:02:02.259> can<00:02:02.469> see

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:02.649 
the front a list muscle here we can see

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:05.999 
the front a list muscle here we can see
that<00:02:02.799> it<00:02:02.950> wrinkles<00:02:03.700> all<00:02:03.969> the<00:02:04.509> way<00:02:04.630> across<00:02:05.009> so

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009 
that it wrinkles all the way across so

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:07.370 
that it wrinkles all the way across so
this<00:02:06.159> patient<00:02:06.399> would<00:02:06.670> benefit<00:02:07.090> from

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
this patient would benefit from

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.319 
this patient would benefit from
treatment<00:02:08.380> across<00:02:09.040> this<00:02:09.280> entire<00:02:09.640> muscle<00:02:09.910> area
