from<00:00:09.690> other<00:00:09.840> nations<00:00:10.080> simulation<00:00:10.679> games<00:00:11.179> now

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
from other nations simulation games now

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.850 
from other nations simulation games now
to<00:00:12.389> start<00:00:12.599> off<00:00:12.660> with<00:00:12.900> politics<00:00:13.410> and<00:00:13.530> war<00:00:13.650> has

to start off with politics and war has

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.269 
to start off with politics and war has
11<00:00:14.580> different<00:00:14.820> resources<00:00:15.570> that<00:00:15.900> are<00:00:16.379> used<00:00:16.859> for

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
11 different resources that are used for

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.429 
11 different resources that are used for
different<00:00:17.940> purposes<00:00:18.090> in<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.660> game<00:00:18.869> by<00:00:19.230> all

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
different purposes in the game by all

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.160 
different purposes in the game by all
kinds<00:00:19.740> of<00:00:19.800> nations<00:00:20.160> and<00:00:20.400> so<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.810> first<00:00:22.020> thing

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
kinds of nations and so the first thing

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.359 
kinds of nations and so the first thing
I<00:00:22.289> want<00:00:22.439> to<00:00:22.470> do<00:00:22.590> is<00:00:22.710> show<00:00:22.800> you<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:22.949> world<00:00:23.160> map

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
I want to do is show you the world map

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.359 
I want to do is show you the world map
now<00:00:24.150> there<00:00:24.420> are<00:00:24.660> seven<00:00:25.170> basic<00:00:25.320> raw<00:00:25.740> resources

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
now there are seven basic raw resources

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.189 
now there are seven basic raw resources
one<00:00:26.970> of<00:00:27.060> them<00:00:27.210> is<00:00:27.330> food<00:00:27.510> which<00:00:27.869> is<00:00:28.019> available

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
one of them is food which is available

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.310 
one of them is food which is available
on<00:00:28.560> all<00:00:28.769> continents<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.789> other<00:00:29.970> six<00:00:30.390> vary<00:00:31.109> on

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
on all continents the other six vary on

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.860 
on all continents the other six vary on
availability<00:00:31.800> each<00:00:32.730> one<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.149> resources<00:00:33.690> is

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
availability each one the resources is

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.049 
availability each one the resources is
found<00:00:34.140> on<00:00:34.350> three<00:00:34.800> of<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:34.980> continents<00:00:35.399> and

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
found on three of the continents and

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.400 
found on three of the continents and
each<00:00:36.239> continent<00:00:36.630> features<00:00:36.960> three<00:00:37.230> of<00:00:37.320> the

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
each continent features three of the

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.010 
each continent features three of the
resources<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.040> so<00:00:38.550> no<00:00:39.300> two<00:00:39.360> continents<00:00:39.899> have

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
resources and so no two continents have

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.660 
resources and so no two continents have
the<00:00:40.140> same<00:00:40.320> combination<00:00:40.860> of<00:00:40.920> resources<00:00:41.489> and

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
the same combination of resources and

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.580 
the same combination of resources and
for<00:00:42.120> this<00:00:42.239> reason<00:00:42.420> you'll<00:00:42.840> always<00:00:43.140> not<00:00:43.440> be

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
for this reason you'll always not be

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.950 
for this reason you'll always not be
able<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:44.120> self-sustain<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.420> you'll<00:00:45.600> need<00:00:45.809> to

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
able to self-sustain and you'll need to

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.709 
able to self-sustain and you'll need to
cooperate<00:00:46.789> with<00:00:47.789> other<00:00:47.969> nations<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.510> trade

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
cooperate with other nations and trade

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.520 
cooperate with other nations and trade
with<00:00:48.870> them<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.200> succeed<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:49.920> advance<00:00:50.190> for<00:00:50.460> it

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
with them to succeed and advance for it

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.959 
with them to succeed and advance for it
now<00:00:52.530> there<00:00:52.829> are<00:00:52.890> essentially<00:00:53.129> three<00:00:53.520> tiers<00:00:53.789> of

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
now there are essentially three tiers of

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.360 
now there are essentially three tiers of
nations<00:00:54.300> in<00:00:54.449> politics<00:00:54.930> more<00:00:55.199> now<00:00:56.039> starting

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
nations in politics more now starting

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.069 
nations in politics more now starting
off<00:00:56.489> in<00:00:56.640> most<00:00:56.820> games<00:00:57.090> you'd<00:00:57.329> be<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.510> brand<00:00:57.989> new

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
off in most games you'd be a brand new

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.540 
off in most games you'd be a brand new
nation<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.590> you<00:00:58.649> really<00:00:58.829> wouldn't<00:00:59.070> have<00:00:59.250> a

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
nation and you really wouldn't have a

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.060 
nation and you really wouldn't have a
whole<00:00:59.730> lot<00:00:59.879> to<00:01:00.030> do<00:01:00.239> there's<00:01:00.840> not<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.079> lot<00:01:01.320> for

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
whole lot to do there's not a lot for

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.369 
whole lot to do there's not a lot for
you<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.340> do<00:01:02.640> because<00:01:03.510> until<00:01:03.899> you<00:01:04.019> are<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.140> large

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
you to do because until you are a large

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.479 
you to do because until you are a large
nation<00:01:04.589> till<00:01:04.920> you've<00:01:05.010> been<00:01:05.129> playing<00:01:05.339> for

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
nation till you've been playing for

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.090 
nation till you've been playing for
months<00:01:06.210> or<00:01:06.330> even<00:01:06.360> years<00:01:06.570> sometimes<00:01:07.229> you

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
months or even years sometimes you

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.800 
months or even years sometimes you
really<00:01:08.369> can't<00:01:08.760> do<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.000> whole<00:01:09.210> lot<00:01:09.270> impaired<00:01:09.750> to

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
really can't do a whole lot impaired to

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.109 
really can't do a whole lot impaired to
what<00:01:09.930> other<00:01:10.080> nations<00:01:10.409> can<00:01:10.590> do<00:01:10.880> however<00:01:11.880> in

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
what other nations can do however in

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.640 
what other nations can do however in
politics<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.630> war<00:01:12.750> this<00:01:12.930> is<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.110> lot<00:01:13.290> different

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
politics and war this is a lot different

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.580 
politics and war this is a lot different
for<00:01:14.430> example<00:01:14.820> as<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.000> new<00:01:15.210> nation<00:01:15.570> your<00:01:16.380> main

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
for example as a new nation your main

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.590 
for example as a new nation your main
goal<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.310> start<00:01:17.640> producing<00:01:17.939> lots<00:01:18.450> of

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
goal is to start producing lots of

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.109 
goal is to start producing lots of
resources<00:01:18.930> because<00:01:19.560> larger<00:01:20.310> nations<00:01:20.640> are<00:01:20.909> in

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
resources because larger nations are in

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.640 
resources because larger nations are in
demand<00:01:21.420> for<00:01:21.570> these<00:01:21.689> resources<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.439> by

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
demand for these resources and by

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.830 
demand for these resources and by
selling<00:01:23.009> these<00:01:23.130> resources<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.790> them<00:01:24.000> you<00:01:24.720> can

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
selling these resources to them you can

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.300 
selling these resources to them you can
gain<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:24.990> lot<00:01:25.080> of<00:01:25.200> money<00:01:25.439> which<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:25.650> can<00:01:25.890> use<00:01:26.070> to

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
gain a lot of money which you can use to

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.060 
gain a lot of money which you can use to
grow<00:01:26.759> your<00:01:26.939> nation<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.479> so<00:01:28.259> because<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:28.799> the

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
grow your nation and so because of the

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.620 
grow your nation and so because of the
high<00:01:29.100> demand<00:01:29.610> for<00:01:29.759> resources<00:01:30.150> that<00:01:30.299> really

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
high demand for resources that really

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.679 
high demand for resources that really
make<00:01:30.780> smaller<00:01:31.110> nations<00:01:31.470> very<00:01:31.710> vital<00:01:32.159> for

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:32.689 
make smaller nations very vital for

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:34.910 
make smaller nations very vital for
example<00:01:33.689> in<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:33.930> war<00:01:34.110> an<00:01:34.229> alliance<00:01:34.500> might<00:01:34.740> want

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
example in a war an alliance might want

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.560 
example in a war an alliance might want
to<00:01:34.979> keep<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.220> very<00:01:35.430> watchful<00:01:36.000> eye<00:01:36.210> on<00:01:36.240> its

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
to keep a very watchful eye on its

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.260 
to keep a very watchful eye on its
economy<00:01:36.890> so<00:01:37.890> that<00:01:37.950> it's<00:01:38.220> smaller<00:01:38.790> nations<00:01:39.150> are

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
economy so that it's smaller nations are

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.060 
economy so that it's smaller nations are
properly<00:01:39.659> supplying<00:01:40.140> its<00:01:40.439> larger<00:01:40.770> nations

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
properly supplying its larger nations

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.950 
properly supplying its larger nations
with<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.400> materials<00:01:41.820> that<00:01:41.939> they<00:01:42.090> need<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.299> win

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
with the materials that they need to win

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.200 
with the materials that they need to win
in<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.229> war<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:44.340> this<00:01:44.490> is<00:01:44.640> something<00:01:44.909> that<00:01:44.970> is

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
in the war and this is something that is

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.819 
in the war and this is something that is
really<00:01:45.570> mimicked<00:01:45.899> in<00:01:45.990> real<00:01:46.290> life<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.740> that's

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
really mimicked in real life and that's

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.340 
really mimicked in real life and that's
what<00:01:47.040> makes<00:01:47.220> politics<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:47.850> more<00:01:47.970> such<00:01:48.180> a

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
what makes politics and more such a

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.679 
what makes politics and more such a
unique<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.470> fun<00:01:49.710> game<00:01:50.210> because<00:01:51.210> it<00:01:51.390> shares

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
unique and fun game because it shares

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.469 
unique and fun game because it shares
these<00:01:51.810> similar<00:01:52.110> ideals<00:01:52.470> with<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.710> real<00:01:52.860> world

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
these similar ideals with the real world

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.600 
these similar ideals with the real world
now<00:01:54.479> as<00:01:54.750> I<00:01:55.140> said<00:01:55.200> new<00:01:55.470> nations<00:01:55.829> can<00:01:56.460> produce

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
now as I said new nations can produce

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.780 
now as I said new nations can produce
these<00:01:56.939> raw<00:01:57.149> resources<00:01:57.829> such<00:01:58.829> as<00:01:58.860> bauxite<00:01:59.430> iron

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
these raw resources such as bauxite iron

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.810 
these raw resources such as bauxite iron
lead<00:02:00.329> uranium<00:02:00.899> oil<00:02:01.200> coal<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:01.979> food<00:02:02.310> which<00:02:02.610> all

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
lead uranium oil coal and food which all

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.340 
lead uranium oil coal and food which all
have<00:02:03.000> varying<00:02:03.360> purposes<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.049> are<00:02:04.140> always

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
have varying purposes and are always

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.280 
have varying purposes and are always
high<00:02:04.680> in<00:02:04.740> demand<00:02:04.920> for<00:02:05.430> large<00:02:06.030> nations

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
high in demand for large nations

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.140 
high in demand for large nations
now<00:02:07.800> a<00:02:07.830> few<00:02:08.040> of<00:02:08.130> these<00:02:08.280> resources<00:02:08.670> can<00:02:09.090> be

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:09.150 
now a few of these resources can be

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.240 
now a few of these resources can be
refined<00:02:09.690> or<00:02:09.960> manufactured<00:02:10.740> into<00:02:10.890> better

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
refined or manufactured into better

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.520 
refined or manufactured into better
resources<00:02:11.820> that<00:02:12.000> also<00:02:12.330> have<00:02:12.540> their<00:02:13.500> own

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
resources that also have their own

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.860 
resources that also have their own
unique<00:02:13.650> purposes<00:02:14.400> for<00:02:14.820> example<00:02:14.880> bauxite<00:02:15.690> is

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
unique purposes for example bauxite is

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.800 
unique purposes for example bauxite is
the<00:02:16.290> raw<00:02:16.440> form<00:02:16.740> of<00:02:16.920> aluminum<00:02:17.310> and<00:02:17.600> middle<00:02:18.600> tier

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
the raw form of aluminum and middle tier

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.660 
the raw form of aluminum and middle tier
nations<00:02:19.140> can<00:02:19.380> refine<00:02:19.710> this<00:02:19.860> bauxite<00:02:20.310> into

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
nations can refine this bauxite into

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.400 
nations can refine this bauxite into
aluminum<00:02:21.060> and<00:02:21.210> then<00:02:21.420> sell<00:02:21.720> that<00:02:21.870> aluminum<00:02:22.200> to

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
aluminum and then sell that aluminum to

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.490 
aluminum and then sell that aluminum to
even<00:02:22.800> larger<00:02:23.160> nations<00:02:23.930> iron<00:02:24.930> can<00:02:25.140> be<00:02:25.230> made<00:02:25.380> in

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
even larger nations iron can be made in

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.110 
even larger nations iron can be made in
the<00:02:25.590> steel<00:02:25.860> lead<00:02:26.340> can<00:02:26.640> be<00:02:26.760> made<00:02:26.910> into

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
the steel lead can be made into

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.900 
the steel lead can be made into
munitions<00:02:27.600> which<00:02:27.840> are<00:02:27.960> like<00:02:28.080> bullets<00:02:28.430> and<00:02:29.430> oil

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
munitions which are like bullets and oil

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.550 
munitions which are like bullets and oil
can<00:02:30.120> be<00:02:30.240> made<00:02:30.390> into<00:02:30.570> gasoline<00:02:30.960> which<00:02:31.380> has<00:02:31.530> a

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
can be made into gasoline which has a

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.070 
can be made into gasoline which has a
lot<00:02:31.800> of<00:02:31.830> purposes<00:02:32.310> as<00:02:32.490> well<00:02:32.520> and<00:02:33.330> so<00:02:33.900> this

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
lot of purposes as well and so this

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.690 
lot of purposes as well and so this
really<00:02:34.290> creates<00:02:34.560> a<00:02:34.740> middle<00:02:35.100> tier<00:02:35.220> of<00:02:35.340> nations

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
really creates a middle tier of nations

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.000 
really creates a middle tier of nations
where<00:02:35.910> these<00:02:36.750> middle<00:02:37.110> tiers<00:02:37.320> as<00:02:37.500> you<00:02:37.650> grow<00:02:37.830> and

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
where these middle tiers as you grow and

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.040 
where these middle tiers as you grow and
as<00:02:38.310> you<00:02:38.580> have<00:02:38.640> advanced<00:02:39.060> somewhat<00:02:39.390> you<00:02:39.690> start

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
as you have advanced somewhat you start

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.020 
as you have advanced somewhat you start
buying<00:02:40.380> these<00:02:40.830> basic<00:02:41.280> resources<00:02:41.700> from<00:02:41.910> the

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
buying these basic resources from the

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.060 
buying these basic resources from the
smaller<00:02:42.270> nations<00:02:42.630> refining<00:02:43.500> them<00:02:43.650> and<00:02:43.860> then

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
smaller nations refining them and then

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.820 
smaller nations refining them and then
shipping<00:02:44.310> them<00:02:44.520> out<00:02:44.610> to<00:02:44.850> larger<00:02:45.240> nations<00:02:45.570> and

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
shipping them out to larger nations and

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.290 
shipping them out to larger nations and
then<00:02:46.830> finally<00:02:47.280> we<00:02:47.400> have<00:02:47.550> the<00:02:47.730> third<00:02:47.760> tier<00:02:48.150> the

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
then finally we have the third tier the

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.180 
then finally we have the third tier the
large<00:02:48.510> nation<00:02:48.870> tier<00:02:49.110> and<00:02:49.800> this<00:02:49.920> tier

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
large nation tier and this tier

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.890 
large nation tier and this tier
essentially<00:02:51.120> makes<00:02:51.300> a<00:02:51.390> lot<00:02:51.540> of<00:02:51.570> their<00:02:51.750> money

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
essentially makes a lot of their money

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.170 
essentially makes a lot of their money
through<00:02:52.520> increasing<00:02:53.520> the<00:02:53.610> quality<00:02:53.970> of<00:02:54.030> life

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
through increasing the quality of life

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.360 
through increasing the quality of life
through<00:02:54.420> of<00:02:54.690> their<00:02:55.050> citizens<00:02:55.470> they<00:02:55.980> want<00:02:56.220> to

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
through of their citizens they want to

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.860 
through of their citizens they want to
increase<00:02:56.670> the<00:02:56.820> average<00:02:56.940> income<00:02:57.420> as<00:02:57.570> much<00:02:57.720> as

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
increase the average income as much as

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.290 
increase the average income as much as
possible<00:02:58.080> and<00:02:58.500> then<00:02:59.040> tax<00:02:59.459> those<00:02:59.730> citizens<00:02:59.970> as

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
possible and then tax those citizens as

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.910 
possible and then tax those citizens as
much<00:03:00.480> as<00:03:00.630> possible<00:03:01.020> and<00:03:01.170> use<00:03:01.290> that<00:03:01.440> money<00:03:01.620> to

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
much as possible and use that money to

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.740 
much as possible and use that money to
then<00:03:02.040> import<00:03:02.490> the<00:03:02.610> resources<00:03:03.120> that<00:03:03.540> they<00:03:03.720> need

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
then import the resources that they need

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.449 
then import the resources that they need
and<00:03:04.140> there<00:03:04.680> are<00:03:04.740> a<00:03:04.800> lot<00:03:04.920> of<00:03:04.950> reasons<00:03:05.160> that

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
and there are a lot of reasons that

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.699 
and there are a lot of reasons that
large<00:03:05.700> nations<00:03:05.880> aren't<00:03:06.240> self-sufficient<00:03:06.959> for

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
large nations aren't self-sufficient for

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.350 
large nations aren't self-sufficient for
example<00:03:08.100> pollution<00:03:08.550> is<00:03:08.670> a<00:03:08.700> main<00:03:08.880> factor<00:03:09.330> in

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
example pollution is a main factor in

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.180 
example pollution is a main factor in
why<00:03:09.600> large<00:03:09.840> nations<00:03:10.260> would<00:03:10.470> rather<00:03:10.680> import

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
why large nations would rather import

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.370 
why large nations would rather import
resources<00:03:11.520> than<00:03:11.970> harvest<00:03:12.510> them<00:03:12.720> domestically

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
resources than harvest them domestically

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:14.780 
resources than harvest them domestically
because<00:03:13.560> that<00:03:13.950> creates<00:03:14.190> a<00:03:14.250> lot<00:03:14.430> of<00:03:14.489> pollution

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
because that creates a lot of pollution

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.820 
because that creates a lot of pollution
which<00:03:15.060> causes<00:03:15.420> problems<00:03:15.810> and<00:03:16.050> decreases

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
which causes problems and decreases

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.610 
which causes problems and decreases
their<00:03:17.010> revenue<00:03:17.459> and<00:03:18.050> so<00:03:19.050> essentially<00:03:19.440> in<00:03:19.530> this

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
their revenue and so essentially in this

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.140 
their revenue and so essentially in this
way<00:03:19.770> you'll<00:03:19.980> see<00:03:20.040> a<00:03:20.160> trickle-down<00:03:20.670> system

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
way you'll see a trickle-down system

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.670 
way you'll see a trickle-down system
these<00:03:21.330> large<00:03:21.600> nations<00:03:22.020> can<00:03:22.290> buy<00:03:22.410> from<00:03:22.590> the

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
these large nations can buy from the

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.470 
these large nations can buy from the
middle<00:03:22.890> nations<00:03:23.220> the<00:03:23.790> middle<00:03:24.030> nations<00:03:24.300> can

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
middle nations the middle nations can

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.300 
middle nations the middle nations can
buy<00:03:24.600> from<00:03:24.780> the<00:03:24.900> low<00:03:25.019> nations<00:03:25.380> and<00:03:25.620> you<00:03:26.010> can<00:03:26.160> see

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
buy from the low nations and you can see

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.880 
buy from the low nations and you can see
the<00:03:26.430> wealth<00:03:26.640> slowly<00:03:27.239> spillover<00:03:27.810> and<00:03:27.959> downward

the wealth slowly spillover and downward

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.800 
the wealth slowly spillover and downward
and<00:03:29.130> you<00:03:29.790> can<00:03:29.910> see<00:03:30.090> that<00:03:30.269> all<00:03:30.420> these<00:03:30.630> nations

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
and you can see that all these nations

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.570 
and you can see that all these nations
are<00:03:31.080> vital<00:03:31.410> because<00:03:31.560> it<00:03:31.709> creates<00:03:32.040> a<00:03:32.190> sort<00:03:32.430> of

are vital because it creates a sort of

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.090 
are vital because it creates a sort of
supply<00:03:33.060> line<00:03:33.330> from<00:03:33.630> small<00:03:34.410> nation<00:03:34.739> to<00:03:34.890> large
