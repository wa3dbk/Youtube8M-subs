because methane is one of the major
greenhouse<00:00:49.440> gases<00:00:50.129> so<00:00:50.969> let's<00:00:51.149> have<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.329> look

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
greenhouse gases so let's have a look

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.420 
greenhouse gases so let's have a look
inside<00:00:54.199> every<00:00:55.199> four<00:00:55.440> days<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.680> new<00:00:55.980> couple<00:00:56.250> of

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
cows is being brought into these

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.500 
cows is being brought into these
chambers<00:00:58.170> all<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:59.430> gases<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.940> cows<00:01:00.149> emitting

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
chambers all the gases the cows emitting

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:08.390 
chambers all the gases the cows emitting
here<00:01:00.840> are<00:01:00.960> being<00:01:01.379> measured<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.949> collected

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.300 

the<00:01:08.880> cow<00:01:09.060> produces<00:01:09.570> roughly<00:01:10.110> 500<00:01:11.040> litres<00:01:11.250> of

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
the cow produces roughly 500 litres of

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.400 
the cow produces roughly 500 litres of
meth<00:01:11.520> in<00:01:11.730> a<00:01:11.790> day<00:01:12.000> which<00:01:12.270> is<00:01:12.450> obviously<00:01:12.990> quite<00:01:13.260> a

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:13.410 
meth in a day which is obviously quite a

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.980 
meth in a day which is obviously quite a
lot<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:13.890> he<00:01:14.700> would<00:01:14.820> like<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.150> reduce<00:01:15.450> that<00:01:15.720> by

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
lot and he would like to reduce that by

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.010 
lot and he would like to reduce that by
taking<00:01:16.560> dietary<00:01:17.220> measures<00:01:17.520> so<00:01:18.450> we<00:01:18.930> have

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
taking dietary measures so we have

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.510 
taking dietary measures so we have
already<00:01:19.140> tested<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.830> couple<00:01:20.130> of<00:01:20.190> dietary

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
already tested a couple of dietary

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.760 
already tested a couple of dietary
measures<00:01:20.760> such<00:01:21.540> as<00:01:21.620> increasing<00:01:22.620> the

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
measures such as increasing the

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.400 
measures such as increasing the
proportion<00:01:23.190> of<00:01:23.670> may<00:01:23.970> Silas<00:01:24.510> corn<00:01:24.840> silage<00:01:25.140> in

proportion of may Silas corn silage in

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.590 
proportion of may Silas corn silage in
the<00:01:25.500> diet<00:01:25.710> for<00:01:25.980> cows<00:01:26.190> which<00:01:26.940> will<00:01:27.180> reduce

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
the diet for cows which will reduce

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.460 
the diet for cows which will reduce
methane<00:01:28.050> by<00:01:28.530> ten<00:01:28.920> or<00:01:29.190> fifteen<00:01:29.670> percent<00:01:30.470> of

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
methane by ten or fifteen percent of

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.560 
methane by ten or fifteen percent of
course<00:01:31.800> if<00:01:32.010> you<00:01:32.130> reduce<00:01:32.490> methane<00:01:32.790> only<00:01:33.390> in<00:01:33.480> a

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
course if you reduce methane only in a

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.510 
course if you reduce methane only in a
small<00:01:33.900> country<00:01:34.140> like<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.680> Netherland<00:01:35.070> it

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
small country like the Netherland it

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.700 
small country like the Netherland it
wouldn't<00:01:35.910> make<00:01:36.030> much<00:01:36.090> difference<00:01:36.680> but<00:01:37.680> a

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
wouldn't make much difference but a

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.470 
wouldn't make much difference but a
major<00:01:38.040> breakthrough<00:01:38.430> in<00:01:38.670> this<00:01:38.910> field<00:01:39.210> would

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:39.480 
major breakthrough in this field would

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.600 
major breakthrough in this field would
have<00:01:39.630> enormous<00:01:40.200> implications<00:01:40.500> for<00:01:41.250> countries

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
have enormous implications for countries

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.840 
have enormous implications for countries
like<00:01:41.640> India<00:01:42.270> Brazil<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:43.050> China<00:01:43.640> these<00:01:44.640> three

like India Brazil and China these three

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.700 
like India Brazil and China these three
countries<00:01:45.119> keep<00:01:45.630> over<00:01:45.960> half<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.440> world's
