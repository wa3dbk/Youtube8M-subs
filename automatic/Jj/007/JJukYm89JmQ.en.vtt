500 times one it was bad enough I tried
the<00:00:53.380> meteor<00:00:53.680> mod<00:00:53.950> and<00:00:54.190> I<00:00:54.610> had<00:00:54.760> to<00:00:54.850> cut<00:00:55.059> out<00:00:55.090> two

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
the meteor mod and I had to cut out two

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:56.760 
the meteor mod and I had to cut out two
minutes<00:00:55.600> of<00:00:55.840> me<00:00:55.930> standing<00:00:56.170> there<00:00:56.470> I<00:00:56.530> was<00:00:56.680> like

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:56.770 
minutes of me standing there I was like

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.560 
minutes of me standing there I was like
why<00:00:56.950> the<00:00:57.040> hell<00:00:57.280> won't<00:00:57.430> this<00:00:57.610> work<00:00:57.820> and<00:00:58.300> it<00:00:58.540> just

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
why the hell won't this work and it just

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.530 
why the hell won't this work and it just
turns<00:00:58.870> out<00:00:59.050> that<00:00:59.230> it<00:00:59.500> lags<00:00:59.739> so<00:01:00.070> bad<00:01:00.309> that<00:01:00.640> it

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:01.540 
turns out that it lags so bad that it

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.079 
turns out that it lags so bad that it
wouldn't<00:01:01.870> work<00:01:02.100> now<00:01:03.100> I<00:01:03.130> cut<00:01:03.579> out<00:01:03.610> a<00:01:03.730> lot<00:01:03.940> of<00:01:03.969> the

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
wouldn't work now I cut out a lot of the

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:06.480 
wouldn't work now I cut out a lot of the
parts<00:01:04.420> where<00:01:04.750> it<00:01:05.199> lags<00:01:05.530> so<00:01:06.009> we<00:01:06.130> can<00:01:06.250> just<00:01:06.369> go

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
parts where it lags so we can just go

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.380 
parts where it lags so we can just go
straight<00:01:06.729> to<00:01:06.850> the<00:01:06.940> explosion<00:01:07.450> and<00:01:09.390> my
