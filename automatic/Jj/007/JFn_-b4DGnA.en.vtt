00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.420
 hello kids here panda commenting and you 

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:07.330
 I bring another gameplay more than the black ops 2 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.860
 as many of you will know that the same 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.809
 Those who follow me on twitter will know 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.450
 I've been sick with pharyngitis 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:14.860
 slight this last week and well just 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.839
 can talk so obviously I could not 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.599
 comment on any gameplay nor can I talk 

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:22.419
 not even five minutes in a row is 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:24.310
 impossible then I was a 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:26.619
 week already after the exams that I have 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.329
 finished already without being able to comment anything neither 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.550
 obviously you can upload any video or 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:31.869
 nothing the good thing is that I could play a lot and 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.610
 I have a lot of gameplays 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:35.740
 spectacular or that I think are 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.300
 pretty good that I think they can 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.070
 serve to help you and entertain us 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.340
 obviously so I hope it 's like that 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:44.560
 this is one of them are 111 casualties I think 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.780
 with the fal the first part because it 's 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:50.080
 pretty bad the truth that happens to me almost 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.530
 always here from 23-6 it seems to me and then 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:55.360
 a second part some a streak of 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.010
 where low I think they are 20-25 weapons 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.810
 and fixation to nuclear and then from 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.540
 contacts bullets and that with swarm and 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:04.119
 the dogs counting the well over 60 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.220
 I think they are then finally 111 finished 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:08.680
 7 asik in the second round are 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.690
 twenty-odd casualties and one death only 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.120
 that is really foolish you will see 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.010
 then I die because I did not have a weapon 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.870
 I was running with a knife was 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.190
 a stone and a weapon comes to me and a 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:18.730
 Uncle enemy who did not expect me though 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.280
 there are clouds 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:23.260
 I did not realize it and obviously in 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.530
 a blade but no ak two thousand rifles 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.850
 It's a fucking jewel so they killed me 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.550
 as you see in the gameplay before clear 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.810
 also comment that it is a little more 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.250
 tactile let's say a little more defensively 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.960
 obviously i'm not russia i walk with the 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.180
 salt because good does not make much sense 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.380
 do that is playing in peat in that 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.090
 move very big 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.680
 de juana distance and using then 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.790
 coverage obviously to have the 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.500
 advantage in all confrontations 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.970
 against the enemy 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.070
 so you 'll see what a little more is 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.540
 you can say that tactical field but 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.790
 I'm a corner obviously but yes 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.350
 I'm using more then the stones and whore 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.119
 the shit so they do not kill me enemy 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.190
 of 20 and yes I'm a little bit 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:58.900
 patient do not give each other crazy to be able 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.490
 take out some gusts and be able to affirm a 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.070
 drop a game saying more than 100 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.960
 low because it was a bit the objective 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.610
 as you know what I want to do 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.320
 behind nuclear with all the weapons and 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.910
 on all the maps but it 's different that 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.550
 I would like to start from 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.910
 more than 100 casualties in this one I think that 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:18.070
 they are 111 but right at the end just when 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.710
 10 seconds left I do not take the dogs 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.060
 the swarms for the third time I see and so 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.920
 that the game is just over I think 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.640
 that may have been easily over 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.350
 of 130 140 casualties but that has the 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.170
 luck of the games there are as you see is 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.910
 when they kill me a bitch but good and 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.340
 there you see the relentless medal that 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.260
 There are 20 casualties so we were almost there 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.550
 a nuclear decade but a good part of the 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.440
 gameplay also wanted to comment a couple 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.140
 of little things the pro I said before that 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.270
 I was sick, you know, I have 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.220
 been pretty fucked with pharyngitis and 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.840
 I had you with hippies before but 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.970
 it was much more much worse than 20 this 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.040
 that was simply that he could not speak 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.660
 nothing for throat and swallowing hurt me 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.300
 and such and that lasted quite a 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.680
 week of the disease but now 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.990
 I'm full but I'm fine and I can 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.030
 keep commenting and as I said before 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.430
 I have a lot of nuclear games 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.350
 and of 100 casualties and lots of boats 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.210
 proportion and also comment that I have 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.670
 used different weapons a lot I suspected 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:15.430
 since he only used alarte dw and ms 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.830
 mc so I used a lot the mp7 had 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.210
 5,000 casualties with the mp7 I used the fal 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.040
 quite and the in the 90 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.630
 I love you will see also a couple of 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.880
 gameplay without nuclear parts with it 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.250
 so good a little variety 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.750
 also to the channel and apart from that also 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.120
 want to comment that I have finished the 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.010
 exams at the university so now 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.710
 I have much more time to comment and 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.050
 play obviously I 'm not much more or 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:40.270
 less stressed so I can comment and 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.580
 games so we can continue with a 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.530
 Regularly upload videos to me 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.320
 channel I hope it's beneficial to me 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.000
 and for you obviously and also that 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.710
 I have a lot of series and small 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.180
 little things besides the nuclear ones and 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:53.920
 the games of more than 100 casualties and 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.170
 that I have a couple of ideas that I think 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.600
 You can like it and I liked it 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:01.990
 enough that I will tell you in the next video 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:03.520
 and then it opens a little then also on 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:05.140
 the 100 casualties and upload entire games 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.000
 do not upload are some part with a lot 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.410
 people in this video that for me is a lot 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.690
 more comfortable because I can comment videos 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:13.540
 shorter and it's more dynamic and more 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.880
 entertaining is not so boring but already 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.790
 you know in the comments what 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:21.540
 what do you think about that 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:24.330
 and also comment that in the channel is 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:26.760
 but now I hope to be able to upload 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.230
 video every day or at least more 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.330
 regularly and not having a stop 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:33.060
 week or whatever I 've had 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:35.400
 in recent months by the 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.830
 university and for this kind of thing and 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.240
 I hope to be able to follow that obviously 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.030
 going up every day and follow 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.470
 raising zombies that do not leave llc and 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.360
 these gameplays of more than 100 casualties 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.030
 singular all that roll in here has 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.590
 taken the game to 111 to 7 created the ones in 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:54.860
 one part is a ninety- one to one 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.860
 I hope you liked it and see you later
