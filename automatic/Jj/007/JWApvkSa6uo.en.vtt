00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.899
 Hello everyone today did a video review on 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.220
 curling remington sang like that 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.570
 me 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:15.150
 I liked her very much 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.449
 let's get down to the detailed description means 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.689
 we have a plastic handle 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:25.109
 beautiful stylish flowers here have 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.449
 us three buttons one button means 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.939
 turn on off there are two buttons 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:34.320
 one you add another temperature 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:37.110
 here's the plastic 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.129
 a tip that does not heat it 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.350
 very big plus 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.300
 there is such a coaster, that is, we 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.829
 put there on the surface and not afraid 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.070
 that us there is something on fire or 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:51.690
 melt very cool rotating 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:56.730
 the cord that is very convenient the cord itself has 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:59.430
 length of 3 meters is also very good and most 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.039
 our main coating is ceramic 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.890
 They say that it does not damage the hair 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.380
 as if i don't know of course well i think 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.820
 any heating element at some 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.520
 degree hurts your hair well 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:16.500
 ceramic means ceramic 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.900
 if still use and extra 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.869
 remedies there is some kind of thermal protection 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.140
 milking we have sold in stores 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:28.560
 that is, it will generally be a super duper 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:31.590
 I liked the curtain very well 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:35.579
 curls hair quickly ie 10 seconds 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:39.000
 and you are ready to curl great curling 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:41.729
 and what else did we have in the kit this 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.270
 Here is such a little book here is a lot 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:48.950
 many pages in Russian in our language 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.990
 we are only 1 2 2 pages 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.659
 we had such a glove 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:02:00.000
 naughty which is very comfortable you dress 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:03.270
 Signet take a strand and with one hand you 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.229
 hold curling iron and start to wind 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.860
 little by little 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:10.920
 and you do it here 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:15.810
 seconds wonderful curl great 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:22.950
 curling iron so here we have this yet 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:25.320
 box means productively written 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.870
 that's what's exclusive 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.820
 my pearl ceramic coating 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.340
 training tons provides optimum 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:35.220
 heating temperature for making it 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.970
 perfect style thirteen twenty 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:41.700
 five millimeters conical forceps for 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:44.970
 soft curls heating control 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:49.440
 temperatures from 130 that is it is minimum 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:53.450
 130 and the maximum is 210 degrees 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:56.190
 multiply like these buttons to manage 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.760
 digital display quickly heat up 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.660
 ready to work in 30 seconds 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.090
 non-heating tip 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.060
 automatic shutdown of work through 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:11.580
 hour heat resistant handbag by the way here it is 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:14.959
 Here is such a blue handbag hot 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:18.780
 I did not try to put a curtain there somehow 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:21.330
 We do not know well, if it is written only 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.180
 then you can probably put a hot duo 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:27.030
 I prefer to cool down and 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.940
 then put this barrel back there 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.489
 the only disadvantage of this bag is that 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:36.410
 herself a curd in like she enters there 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:40.380
 Yes, look, but the cord itself is included 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:42.810
 it turns out there does not fit that is it 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:47.220
 Straight with difficulty there can be stuffed like 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:49.650
 then something like this if you try 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.360
 You can and completely vzbryknut well 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.010
 as it is of course not very convenient but 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.459
 it is not 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:59.820
 this is all garbage the most important thing is curling is good 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:03.450
 working supersu perfectly means there is 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:06.730
 glove and rotating 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.680
 Here is such a great cool 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:12.580
 I really liked it before me 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:15.610
 it was loyko me so praised yes what are you 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:17.380
 she was professional in my name 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:23.470
 would have fought but she had this here 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:26.230
 clamp buy and it does not hurt there 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:28.660
 hair, too, I have seen enough 1 beauty 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.540
 blogger how she praised her I 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.760
 ran to a professional store 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:35.830
 bought this curling iron and came home became 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.910
 to hammer and girls i just haven't 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.480
 cheat 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:43.230
 it didn't work out curls just awful i 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.900
 I think that with my hair why they 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:50.050
 wriggle turned out done in this flesh 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:53.410
 I do not know and I gave the girls she and 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:56.410
 used in general the curd did not flood 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:59.800
 Well, in short, not the essence of the girls here 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:03.210
 this curler calls for any hair thin and 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:06.100
 thick you have no difference you can 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.840
 do a lot of hairstyles with this curling 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:10.360
 that is, if you want small curls 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.890
 please you take 5 by name if you 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.480
 want to 

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:15.220
 large such curls take strand 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:18.130
 more that is, it gives us just 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:20.710
 excellent curls they are as soft as 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:26.040
 as if you have your own length 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:28.540
 and hair are curled my hair 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:32.410
 length just below the shoulders to 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:35.410
 but I generally develop the whole head in 10 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:38.680
 minutes just fine fast 10 minutes and 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:41.470
