you're<00:03:34.130> going<00:03:34.250> to<00:03:34.310> be<00:03:34.370> doing<00:03:34.459> that<00:03:34.670> well<00:03:35.359> I

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
you're going to be doing that well I

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.380 
you're going to be doing that well I
think<00:03:35.540> what<00:03:36.200> he's<00:03:36.320> done<00:03:36.560> in<00:03:36.829> the<00:03:37.150> three<00:03:38.150> plus

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
think what he's done in the three plus

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.300 
think what he's done in the three plus
years<00:03:38.420> he's<00:03:38.900> been<00:03:39.049> in<00:03:39.230> office<00:03:39.350> has<00:03:42.160> done<00:03:43.160> the

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
years he's been in office has done the

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:44.770 
years he's been in office has done the
promises<00:03:43.790> that<00:03:43.820> he<00:03:44.090> said<00:03:44.269> he<00:03:44.359> was<00:03:44.480> going<00:03:44.630> to<00:03:44.660> do

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
promises that he said he was going to do

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.560 
promises that he said he was going to do
when<00:03:44.989> when<00:03:45.380> he<00:03:45.470> was<00:03:45.560> elected<00:03:45.829> and<00:03:46.190> I<00:03:47.060> think

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:47.570 
when when he was elected and I think

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:49.479 
when when he was elected and I think
with<00:03:47.750> four<00:03:47.959> more<00:03:48.140> years<00:03:48.380> we<00:03:48.620> can<00:03:48.859> keep<00:03:49.280> the

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
with four more years we can keep the

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:51.310 
with four more years we can keep the
economy<00:03:49.670> on<00:03:50.030> the<00:03:50.209> trend<00:03:50.510> it<00:03:50.630> is<00:03:50.780> and<00:03:51.019> I<00:03:51.290> think

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320 
economy on the trend it is and I think

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.550 
economy on the trend it is and I think
it's<00:03:51.650> up<00:03:51.950> surging<00:03:52.400> trend<00:03:53.140> do<00:03:54.140> you<00:03:54.260> have<00:03:54.380> any

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
it's up surging trend do you have any

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.509 
it's up surging trend do you have any
opinion<00:03:54.920> a<00:03:54.980> lot<00:03:55.070> of<00:03:55.220> people<00:03:55.400> are<00:03:55.489> talking

about the added police presence that
