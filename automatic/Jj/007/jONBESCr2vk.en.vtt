00:05:44.619 --> 00:05:44.629 
standing by at Randall I thought them to

standing by at Randall I thought them to
be<00:05:44.749> some<00:05:44.929> protection

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:46.169

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:52.169 
I wasn't really sure is everyone Potter

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:53.059 
I wasn't really sure is everyone Potter
what<00:05:52.409> I<00:05:52.439> said

00:05:53.059 --> 00:05:53.069 
what I said

00:05:53.069 --> 00:06:03.819 
what I said
a<00:05:53.099> small<00:05:53.460> plane<00:05:53.729> passed<00:05:54.029> overhead

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:03.829 

00:06:03.829 --> 00:06:07.879 

well<00:06:04.829> it<00:06:05.789> could<00:06:06.119> have<00:06:06.209> been<00:06:06.239> sabotage<00:06:06.929> there

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:07.889 
well it could have been sabotage there

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:11.139 
well it could have been sabotage there
are<00:06:08.009> some<00:06:08.339> who<00:06:08.519> hate<00:06:08.729> steam<00:06:09.089> engines<00:06:09.419> still

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:11.149 
are some who hate steam engines still

00:06:11.149 --> 00:06:14.239 
are some who hate steam engines still
yes<00:06:12.149> but<00:06:12.959> who<00:06:13.199> would<00:06:13.379> be<00:06:13.529> stupid<00:06:13.829> enough<00:06:14.039> to

00:06:14.239 --> 00:06:14.249 
yes but who would be stupid enough to

00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:18.859 
yes but who would be stupid enough to
sabotage<00:06:14.939> a<00:06:14.969> railway<00:06:15.889> that's<00:06:16.889> true<00:06:17.629> but<00:06:18.629> I

00:06:18.859 --> 00:06:18.869 
sabotage a railway that's true but I

00:06:18.869 --> 00:06:20.719 
sabotage a railway that's true but I
think<00:06:19.409> we<00:06:19.559> should<00:06:19.589> still<00:06:19.949> consider<00:06:20.129> human

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:20.729 
think we should still consider human

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:25.669 
think we should still consider human
hair<00:06:22.309> yes<00:06:23.309> but<00:06:24.029> also<00:06:24.509> remember<00:06:25.199> we<00:06:25.619> are

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:25.679 
hair yes but also remember we are

00:06:25.679 --> 00:06:27.819 
hair yes but also remember we are
talking<00:06:26.069> about<00:06:26.129> an<00:06:26.369> experienced<00:06:26.969> workers<00:06:27.360> who

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:27.829 
talking about an experienced workers who

00:06:27.829 --> 00:06:30.679 
talking about an experienced workers who
had<00:06:28.829> been<00:06:28.979> driving<00:06:29.219> steam<00:06:29.699> for<00:06:29.999> over<00:06:30.179> 25<00:06:30.659> years

00:06:30.679 --> 00:06:30.689 
had been driving steam for over 25 years

00:06:30.689 --> 00:06:32.539 
had been driving steam for over 25 years
I<00:06:31.259> think<00:06:31.769> they<00:06:32.099> would<00:06:32.249> know<00:06:32.369> it<00:06:32.429> with

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:32.549 
I think they would know it with

00:06:32.549 --> 00:06:35.899 
I think they would know it with
everything<00:06:33.949> what's<00:06:34.949> about<00:06:35.159> the<00:06:35.219> passengers

00:06:35.899 --> 00:06:35.909 
everything what's about the passengers

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:44.659 
everything what's about the passengers
how<00:06:36.419> many<00:06:36.689> survived<00:06:38.809> six<00:06:40.429> I<00:06:43.189> think<00:06:44.189> this<00:06:44.519> may

00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:44.669 
how many survived six I think this may

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:48.949 
how many survived six I think this may
be<00:06:44.729> a<00:06:45.119> good<00:06:45.389> time<00:06:45.769> for<00:06:46.769> some<00:06:46.829> flight<00:06:47.959> maybe

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:48.959 
be a good time for some flight maybe

00:06:48.959 --> 00:06:51.829 
be a good time for some flight maybe
even<00:06:49.229> prayer<00:06:49.499> for<00:06:49.679> those<00:06:49.829> guys<00:06:50.509> we<00:06:51.509> can't<00:06:51.719> do

00:06:51.829 --> 00:06:51.839 
even prayer for those guys we can't do

00:06:51.839 --> 00:06:54.709 
even prayer for those guys we can't do
anything<00:06:52.110> about<00:06:52.319> it<00:06:52.499> them<00:06:52.969> all<00:06:53.969> we<00:06:54.119> can<00:06:54.269> do<00:06:54.419> is
