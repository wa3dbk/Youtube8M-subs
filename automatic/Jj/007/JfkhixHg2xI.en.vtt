 and here we see that the word is composed 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.100

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.030

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.329
 of the cell phone 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.039
 to each weight is behind we have the number 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:03.190

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:06.430
 lecce is the email and others 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.570
 data there the cell phone in the part of 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.210
 back we have what are the 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:13.390
 characteristics of the cell phone is that it is 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:16.600
 a 4g version that comes with 8 cores 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:19.030
 of the 64-bit processor is a screen 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.900
 of 5.1 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:26.950
 h the change resolution increased in full 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:29.170
 hd to 44 h from the rear camera of 10 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.500
 megapixels and the front or the front 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.420
 5 megapixel cell line also 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.980
 with a possibility to make a charge 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.280
 wireless 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.930
 and I saw the internal internal memory of 30 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.580
 logical remember that is already familiar 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.010
 is 6 can no longer be expanded by 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:49.590
 sd card but that is already with what 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:52.210
 come internally be 32 64 128 gb 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.549
 also here we are going to highlight it 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.540
 we take away this part here we have the 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:58.049
 White box 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.049
 simple 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.320
 here come so many that are already the 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.170
 materials in instructions from the 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.869
 warranty 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:10.640
 we have the cell phone on the 16th and the 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.640
 black version 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.070
 and here we intend with the cuts in 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.070
 curve 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.819
 both on the right side and on the side 

00:02:18.249 --> 00:02:20.819
 left 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.380
 it's light enough it feels very 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.520
 well in the hands is quite thin and 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.990
 with these curves 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.090
 the feeling that stops as slimmer 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.400
 a part back that we already have the 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.110
 typical plastic material or the lid that 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.240
 it was already removed material in a single 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.180
 body and you can not remove the lid 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.960
 back and on the back cover is with a 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.360
 material like there is a glass 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.950
 the screen comes with glass gorilla 4 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.500
 that gives greater protection to the 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.500
 screen against scratches or bumps 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:58.690
 here we see it the camera also excels 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:02.700
 a little bit like it works like that of 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.700
 iphone sticks out a little 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.530
 this is pretty nice 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.260
 and we are going to learn it 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:19.880
 and later on we will make an analysis 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:22.760
 at the depth of the cell 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.380
 to check the camera the speed and 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.790
 to see how the aura action of the 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.950
 drums 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.200
 for now that's all social a boxing 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.680
 colombia mobile and see you in the 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.680
