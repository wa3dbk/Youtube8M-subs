00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
even though it's wood it'll go into the

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.949 
even though it's wood it'll go into the
system<00:02:20.640> it'll<00:02:21.000> get<00:02:21.090> pulled<00:02:21.360> out<00:02:21.480> through<00:02:21.720> that

system it'll get pulled out through that

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.920 
system it'll get pulled out through that
pipe<00:02:22.319> and<00:02:22.760> again<00:02:23.760> it<00:02:23.940> falls<00:02:24.180> through<00:02:24.540> because

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
pipe and again it falls through because

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.690

so you know it sticks are building up
into<00:02:52.200> here<00:02:52.440> as<00:02:52.590> is<00:02:52.890> the<00:02:53.099> cobblestone<00:02:53.640> which<00:02:53.849> is

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
into here as is the cobblestone which is

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.030 
into here as is the cobblestone which is
coming<00:02:54.180> out<00:02:54.269> of<00:02:54.329> that<00:02:54.390> chest<00:02:54.890> and<00:02:55.890> of<00:02:56.010> course
