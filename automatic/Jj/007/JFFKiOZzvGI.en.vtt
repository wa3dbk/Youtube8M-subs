yeah it's really good to see no we're
going<00:00:02.370> to<00:00:02.429> be<00:00:02.490> showing<00:00:02.730> people<00:00:02.820> because<00:00:03.240> it's

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
going to be showing people because it's

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.110 
going to be showing people because it's
all<00:00:03.720> about<00:00:04.069> back<00:00:05.069> problems<00:00:05.640> doesn't<00:00:05.819> it<00:00:06.029> you

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
all about back problems doesn't it you

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.240 
all about back problems doesn't it you
did<00:00:06.210> an<00:00:06.270> expert<00:00:06.839> on<00:00:07.140> this<00:00:07.410> and<00:00:07.470> I'm<00:00:07.799> sorting

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
did an expert on this and I'm sorting

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.250 
did an expert on this and I'm sorting
out<00:00:08.370> people's<00:00:08.670> backs<00:00:08.849> so<00:00:09.360> much<00:00:09.540> saw<00:00:09.750> that<00:00:09.990> then

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
out people's backs so much saw that then

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.890 
out people's backs so much saw that then
Prince<00:00:10.620> Charles<00:00:10.980> has<00:00:11.099> asked<00:00:11.309> you<00:00:11.370> for<00:00:11.519> help

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:14.900 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.150 

manipulated<00:00:15.900> that<00:00:16.020> over<00:00:16.199> Spain<00:00:16.440> because<00:00:17.039> he

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
manipulated that over Spain because he

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.680 
manipulated that over Spain because he
said<00:00:17.310> lots<00:00:17.490> of<00:00:17.550> polo<00:00:17.760> injuries<00:00:18.180> hasn't<00:00:18.449> any

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
said lots of polo injuries hasn't any

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.349 
said lots of polo injuries hasn't any
has<00:00:18.840> problems<00:00:19.410> yes<00:00:20.160> he<00:00:20.430> said<00:00:20.609> he's<00:00:20.760> active<00:00:21.150> and

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
has problems yes he said he's active and

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.540 
has problems yes he said he's active and
he<00:00:21.449> likes<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:22.080> ride<00:00:22.380> he<00:00:22.680> likes<00:00:22.890> to<00:00:23.100> do<00:00:23.250> things

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
he likes to ride he likes to do things

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.029 
he likes to ride he likes to do things
when<00:00:24.449> he's<00:00:24.600> not<00:00:24.779> on<00:00:24.840> duty<00:00:25.199> he<00:00:25.380> likes<00:00:25.590> to<00:00:25.740> get<00:00:25.890> up

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
when he's not on duty he likes to get up

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.950 
when he's not on duty he likes to get up
and<00:00:26.250> get<00:00:26.340> lots<00:00:26.519> of<00:00:26.670> fresh<00:00:27.300> air<00:00:27.510> through<00:00:27.750> his

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
and get lots of fresh air through his

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.769 
and get lots of fresh air through his
lungs<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.650> so<00:00:29.010> inevitably<00:00:29.910> I<00:00:30.269> guess<00:00:30.539> that

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
lungs and so inevitably I guess that

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.170 
lungs and so inevitably I guess that
knocks<00:00:31.289> his<00:00:31.470> span<00:00:31.710> around<00:00:32.040> a<00:00:32.099> bit<00:00:32.279> great<00:00:32.910> sort

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
knocks his span around a bit great sort

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.729 
knocks his span around a bit great sort
so<00:00:33.570> really<00:00:33.930> I<00:00:33.960> mean<00:00:34.140> is<00:00:34.260> there<00:00:34.380> anything<00:00:34.590> that

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
so really I mean is there anything that

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:35.780 
so really I mean is there anything that
you<00:00:34.890> would<00:00:34.980> say<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.160> any<00:00:35.370> because<00:00:35.579> that

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
you would say to any because that

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.639 
you would say to any because that
problem<00:00:36.210> is<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.329> huge<00:00:36.840> problem<00:00:37.440> in<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.620> country

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
problem is a huge problem in the country

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.580 
problem is a huge problem in the country
as<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:38.219> is<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:38.850> really<00:00:39.270> difficult<00:00:39.600> one<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.260> so

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
as it is a really difficult one and so

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.100 
as it is a really difficult one and so
many<00:00:40.739> people<00:00:41.070> get<00:00:41.190> into<00:00:41.430> so<00:00:41.579> many<00:00:41.670> ds<00:00:42.030> of<00:00:42.420> work

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
many people get into so many ds of work

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.560 
many people get into so many ds of work
laws<00:00:43.440> because<00:00:43.980> we<00:00:44.100> look<00:00:44.460> back<00:00:44.610> is<00:00:45.090> there<00:00:45.390> any

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
laws because we look back is there any

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.170 
laws because we look back is there any
one<00:00:45.870> thing<00:00:46.079> that<00:00:46.260> we<00:00:46.350> could<00:00:46.500> do<00:00:46.739> well<00:00:47.730> maybe<00:00:47.850> we

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
one thing that we could do well maybe we

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.660 
one thing that we could do well maybe we
will<00:00:48.719> it<00:00:48.870> be<00:00:48.989> bear<00:00:49.170> in<00:00:49.320> mind<00:00:49.530> that<00:00:49.710> be<00:00:49.980> that<00:00:50.579> the

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
will it be bear in mind that be that the

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.700 
will it be bear in mind that be that the
main<00:00:50.879> cause<00:00:51.270> of<00:00:51.300> that<00:00:51.660> problems<00:00:52.050> as<00:00:52.230> I<00:00:52.260> see<00:00:52.649> it

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
main cause of that problems as I see it

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.229 
main cause of that problems as I see it
right<00:00:53.219> is<00:00:53.430> it<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.670> base<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.149> spine

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
right is it the base of the spine

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.750 
right is it the base of the spine
compresses<00:00:55.020> because<00:00:55.379> we're<00:00:55.559> vertical<00:00:56.070> the

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
compresses because we're vertical the

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.610 
compresses because we're vertical the
spine<00:00:57.000> is<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.239> vertical<00:00:57.600> structure<00:00:57.899> race<00:00:58.289> and

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
spine is a vertical structure race and

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.680 
spine is a vertical structure race and
because<00:00:58.829> we<00:00:58.949> also<00:00:59.100> sit<00:00:59.550> too<00:00:59.789> much<00:01:00.000> we're<00:01:00.570> not

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
because we also sit too much we're not

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.209 
because we also sit too much we're not
actually<00:01:00.899> meant<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.350> sit<00:01:01.559> as<00:01:01.649> much<00:01:01.800> as<00:01:01.949> we<00:01:02.070> do

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
actually meant to sit as much as we do

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.789 
actually meant to sit as much as we do
and<00:01:02.609> because<00:01:03.210> we<00:01:03.390> sit<00:01:03.600> so<00:01:03.809> much<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.439> base<00:01:04.619> of

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
and because we sit so much the base of

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.340 
and because we sit so much the base of
the<00:01:04.860> spine<00:01:04.949> compresses<00:01:05.880> okay<00:01:06.659> in<00:01:06.780> comes<00:01:06.990> bahut

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
the spine compresses okay in comes bahut

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.429 
the spine compresses okay in comes bahut
comes<00:01:08.010> brittle<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.510> little<00:01:09.750> shock<00:01:09.990> absorbers

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
comes brittle the little shock absorbers

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:11.899 
comes brittle the little shock absorbers
between<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.890> vertebrae<00:01:11.310> known<00:01:11.640> as<00:01:11.790> the

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
between the vertebrae known as the

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.840 
between the vertebrae known as the
intervertebral<00:01:12.180> discs<00:01:12.900> lose<00:01:13.830> water<00:01:14.250> so<00:01:14.729> the

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
intervertebral discs lose water so the

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.520 
intervertebral discs lose water so the
spine<00:01:15.090> actually<00:01:15.479> compresses<00:01:16.020> at<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.200> basin

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
spine actually compresses at the basin

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.770 
spine actually compresses at the basin
becomes<00:01:16.799> brittle<00:01:17.040> so<00:01:17.850> as<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.030> fundamental

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
becomes brittle so as a fundamental

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.679 
becomes brittle so as a fundamental

causing trouble to start with I believe

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.230 
causing trouble to start with I believe
you<00:01:25.770> need<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.100> decompress<00:01:26.549> your<00:01:26.670> spine<00:01:26.850> all

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
you need to decompress your spine all

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.980 
you need to decompress your spine all
the<00:01:27.540> time<00:01:28.130> well<00:01:29.130> this<00:01:29.759> back<00:01:30.030> block<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:30.840> I'll

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
you slide a block under but it doesn't

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
where you feed her down like this you

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.550 
where you feed her down like this you
lift<00:03:33.640> your<00:03:33.820> head<00:03:33.970> a<00:03:34.000> couple<00:03:34.209> of<00:03:34.420> that's<00:03:35.200> it<00:03:35.410> now

lift your head a couple of that's it now
that<00:03:35.680> the<00:03:35.890> crunches<00:03:36.280> that's<00:03:36.459> what<00:03:36.580> everybody

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
that the crunches that's what everybody

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.550 
that the crunches that's what everybody
does<00:03:37.120> that's<00:03:37.720> what<00:03:37.870> they<00:03:37.959> should<00:03:37.989> never<00:03:38.320> do

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
does that's what they should never do

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.590 
does that's what they should never do
that<00:03:38.830> compresses<00:03:39.340> the<00:03:39.610> spine<00:03:39.850> yeah<00:03:40.090> sometimes

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
that compresses the spine yeah sometimes

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.780 
that compresses the spine yeah sometimes
but<00:03:40.720> in<00:03:40.810> the<00:03:40.930> very<00:03:41.019> very<00:03:41.170> occasions<00:03:41.799> I<00:03:41.950> do<00:03:42.580> that

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
but in the very very occasions I do that

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.210 
but in the very very occasions I do that
we're<00:03:43.030> gonna<00:03:43.330> have<00:03:43.510> a<00:03:43.570> madness<00:03:44.560> I<00:03:44.739> actually

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
we're gonna have a madness I actually

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.680 
we're gonna have a madness I actually
think<00:03:45.549> for<00:03:45.760> taste<00:03:45.940> it<00:03:46.030> just<00:03:46.209> hurt<00:03:46.360> you<00:03:46.480> by

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
think for taste it just hurt you by

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.590 
think for taste it just hurt you by
adults<00:03:47.410> really<00:03:47.890> embrace<00:03:48.310> it<00:03:48.580> more<00:03:48.730> just<00:03:49.239> do<00:03:49.480> it

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
adults really embrace it more just do it

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.479 
adults really embrace it more just do it
just<00:03:49.780> open<00:03:50.560> it<00:03:50.620> out<00:03:50.799> again<00:03:51.040> that's<00:03:51.220> it<00:03:51.370> and

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
just open it out again that's it and

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:53.850 
just open it out again that's it and
that's<00:03:51.810> separating<00:03:52.810> the<00:03:52.930> base<00:03:53.110> as<00:03:53.410> much<00:03:53.620> space

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860 
that's separating the base as much space

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.949 
that's separating the base as much space
and<00:03:54.760> that's<00:03:54.850> a<00:03:55.000> wonderful<00:03:55.239> preventative

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
and that's a wonderful preventative

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:57.660 
and that's a wonderful preventative
thing<00:03:56.140> to<00:03:56.260> do<00:03:56.380> if<00:03:56.920> you're<00:03:57.130> in<00:03:57.250> the<00:03:57.340> middle<00:03:57.580> of

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
thing to do if you're in the middle of

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.990 
thing to do if you're in the middle of
an<00:03:57.760> attack<00:03:58.090> of<00:03:59.049> back<00:03:59.470> pain<00:03:59.739> the<00:04:00.430> back<00:04:00.610> the<00:04:00.880> back

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
an attack of back pain the back the back

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.320 
an attack of back pain the back the back
drops<00:04:01.299> quite<00:04:01.620> provoking<00:04:02.620> rates<00:04:03.459> but<00:04:03.970> it<00:04:04.180> will

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
drops quite provoking rates but it will

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.630 
drops quite provoking rates but it will
also<00:04:04.540> help<00:04:04.900> you<00:04:05.140> but<00:04:05.320> really<00:04:05.890> is<00:04:06.130> a<00:04:06.160> routine

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
also help you but really is a routine

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.160 
also help you but really is a routine
thing<00:04:06.790> as<00:04:06.910> a<00:04:06.940> fundamental<00:04:07.570> perhaps<00:04:07.690> don't<00:04:08.019> do

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
thing as a fundamental perhaps don't do

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.530 
thing as a fundamental perhaps don't do
it<00:04:08.260> when<00:04:08.410> you're<00:04:08.530> in<00:04:08.560> pain<00:04:08.890> right<00:04:09.299> do<00:04:10.299> it<00:04:10.330> is<00:04:10.510> a

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
it when you're in pain right do it is a

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.199 
it when you're in pain right do it is a
preventative<00:04:11.260> you<00:04:11.950> can<00:04:12.130> stop<00:04:12.340> now

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.659 

Sylvania<00:04:15.989> is<00:04:16.169> really<00:04:16.380> good<00:04:16.500> so<00:04:17.009> that<00:04:17.039> that<00:04:17.519> can

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
Sylvania is really good so that that can

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:19.370 
Sylvania is really good so that that can
think<00:04:17.850> of<00:04:17.970> a<00:04:18.120> back<00:04:18.299> look<00:04:18.630> would<00:04:18.870> actually<00:04:19.259> work

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
think of a back look would actually work

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.140 
think of a back look would actually work
well<00:04:19.620> and<00:04:19.799> just<00:04:20.009> do<00:04:20.400> you<00:04:20.759> know<00:04:20.850> making<00:04:21.060> sure

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
well and just do you know making sure

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.390 
well and just do you know making sure
you're<00:04:21.449> doing<00:04:21.539> that<00:04:21.660> also<00:04:21.840> we<00:04:22.410> slouch

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
you're doing that also we slouch

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.070 
you're doing that also we slouch
we<00:04:23.550> slouch<00:04:23.820> so<00:04:24.060> much<00:04:24.240> to<00:04:24.389> it<00:04:24.479> I<00:04:24.539> do<00:04:24.600> all<00:04:24.930> the

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
we slouch so much to it I do all the

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.330 
we slouch so much to it I do all the
time<00:04:25.199> I'm<00:04:25.380> sitting<00:04:25.680> in<00:04:25.740> that<00:04:25.860> sort<00:04:26.070> of<00:04:26.130> those

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
time I'm sitting in that sort of those

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.219 
time I'm sitting in that sort of those
in<00:04:26.520> England<00:04:26.789> absolutely<00:04:27.389> what<00:04:27.840> happens

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:28.229 
in England absolutely what happens

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:30.830 
in England absolutely what happens
what's<00:04:28.949> particularly<00:04:29.340> bad<00:04:29.669> about<00:04:29.940> sitting<00:04:30.630> is

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
what's particularly bad about sitting is

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.439 
what's particularly bad about sitting is
the<00:04:30.900> slouching<00:04:31.680> if<00:04:32.280> if<00:04:32.669> when<00:04:32.910> you're<00:04:33.060> sitting

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:33.449 
the slouching if if when you're sitting

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:36.350 
the slouching if if when you're sitting
you<00:04:33.570> can<00:04:33.600> keep<00:04:33.990> an<00:04:34.139> S<00:04:34.289> Bend<00:04:34.650> from<00:04:35.520> the<00:04:35.610> side<00:04:35.970> a

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
you can keep an S Bend from the side a

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.450 
you can keep an S Bend from the side a
hollow<00:04:36.600> here<00:04:37.050> yeah<00:04:37.380> then<00:04:37.770> your<00:04:37.919> spine<00:04:38.160> won't

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
hollow here yeah then your spine won't

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.150 
hollow here yeah then your spine won't
compress<00:04:38.910> so<00:04:39.120> much<00:04:39.300> this<00:04:40.050> you<00:04:40.169> slouch<00:04:40.680> like<00:04:41.009> we

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
compress so much this you slouch like we

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.129 
compress so much this you slouch like we
all<00:04:41.280> do<00:04:41.520> and<00:04:42.330> these<00:04:42.479> surface<00:04:42.960> here

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:43.139 
all do and these surface here

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:49.850 
all do and these surface here
particularly<00:04:43.500> bad<00:04:43.830> they<00:04:44.400> are<00:04:44.520> actually<00:04:48.860> that

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
particularly bad they are actually that

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.499 
particularly bad they are actually that
makes<00:04:50.190> the<00:04:50.340> spine<00:04:50.580> compressed<00:04:51.030> more<00:04:51.240> and<00:04:51.419> that

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:51.509 
makes the spine compressed more and that

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:54.230 
makes the spine compressed more and that
makes<00:04:51.750> the<00:04:51.900> disks<00:04:52.320> lose<00:04:52.650> fluid<00:04:53.220> more<00:04:53.430> that

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
makes the disks lose fluid more that

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.990 
makes the disks lose fluid more that
means<00:04:54.710> whenever<00:04:55.710> the<00:04:55.919> spine<00:04:56.130> compresses<00:04:56.759> more

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
means whenever the spine compresses more

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.779 
means whenever the spine compresses more
it's<00:04:57.720> easier<00:04:58.199> to<00:04:58.320> hurt<00:04:58.530> but<00:04:59.460> you'd<00:04:59.610> also

00:04:59.779 --> 00:04:59.789 
it's easier to hurt but you'd also

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:02.450 
it's easier to hurt but you'd also
prevent<00:05:00.780> stiff<00:05:01.020> measures<00:05:01.440> like<00:05:01.650> this<00:05:01.889> about

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
prevent stiff measures like this about

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:03.740 
prevent stiff measures like this about
their<00:05:02.639> alternative<00:05:03.240> treatments<00:05:03.630> like

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
their alternative treatments like

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.180 
their alternative treatments like
acupuncture<00:05:04.289> like<00:05:04.530> a<00:05:04.560> pear<00:05:04.800> shape<00:05:04.830> things

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
acupuncture like a pear shape things

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:06.950 
acupuncture like a pear shape things
like<00:05:05.400> that<00:05:05.580> you're<00:05:05.880> facing<00:05:06.060> that<00:05:06.210> yes<00:05:06.660> I<00:05:06.840> mean

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
like that you're facing that yes I mean

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.719

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470

yeah but I'm more interested in the sort
of<00:05:25.530> nuts<00:05:26.070> and<00:05:26.250> bolts<00:05:26.550> physical<00:05:27.000> things<00:05:27.180> of

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
of nuts and bolts physical things of

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:28.939 
of nuts and bolts physical things of
what<00:05:27.479> goes<00:05:27.659> wrong<00:05:27.930> right<00:05:28.110> how<00:05:28.590> the<00:05:28.650> spine

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:28.949 
what goes wrong right how the spine

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:31.070 
what goes wrong right how the spine
actually<00:05:29.340> compresses<00:05:29.940> and<00:05:30.150> how<00:05:30.570> the<00:05:30.630> joints

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
actually compresses and how the joints

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.589 
actually compresses and how the joints
start<00:05:31.260> to<00:05:31.440> rub<00:05:31.650> when<00:05:31.860> you<00:05:31.979> lose<00:05:32.270> when<00:05:33.270> you<00:05:33.300> lose

00:05:33.589 --> 00:05:33.599 
start to rub when you lose when you lose

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:35.390 
start to rub when you lose when you lose
bounce<00:05:34.169> from<00:05:34.409> your<00:05:34.620> shock<00:05:34.770> absorbers<00:05:35.250> when

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 
bounce from your shock absorbers when

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.180 
bounce from your shock absorbers when
the<00:05:35.490> span<00:05:35.699> literally<00:05:36.570> piles<00:05:37.380> down<00:05:37.710> on<00:05:37.889> itself

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.190 
the span literally piles down on itself

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.570 
the span literally piles down on itself
and<00:05:39.199> becomes<00:05:40.199> brittle<00:05:40.440> as<00:05:40.680> I<00:05:40.770> said<00:05:41.010> before<00:05:41.159> and

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 
and becomes brittle as I said before and

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.060 
and becomes brittle as I said before and
so<00:05:42.000> I'm<00:05:42.120> interested<00:05:42.570> in<00:05:42.840> showing<00:05:43.500> people<00:05:43.650> what

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500 
to do in a very simple way but they can

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.830
