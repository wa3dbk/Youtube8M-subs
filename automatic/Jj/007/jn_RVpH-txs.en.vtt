00:00:01.489 --> 00:00:08.639
 hi fisherman want to show you how 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:11.820
 make the most common most 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:15.929
 simple pedal snap called 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:21.090
 equip garner her need to knit on 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:24.660
 braids but to be better seen and 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:30.960
 to make it faster I will knit on 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:38.430
 fishing line about us on the line 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:38.910
 wicker we take a feeder that us 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.020
 need 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:45.000
 as much as possible fastener without me 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:50.870
 use zipper that you could 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:56.510
 put different feeders here we take 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.510
 we dress our feeder on a braid 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:06.540
 stepping somewhere centimeters i think thats 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:13.820
 such somewhere 50 centimeters that's the end 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:19.140
 line we enter 50 centimeters we take 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:22.280
 two lines approach we took a line 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.260
 two retreat somewhere 10-15 centimeters 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:29.300
 beta centimeters like this somewhere 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:32.840
 10 centimeters a little more than 12 somewhere and 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:38.810
 loop here 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:43.500
 loop do such a pretty big 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.909
 so that you can feed the feeder do 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:52.970
 eight knot loop 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:52.970
 Here we scroll through our feeder 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:02:03.259
 somewhere in 10-15 centimeters 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:11.060
 tighten our knot knot knot 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:18.060
 be sure to wet moisten and 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:24.330
 we tightened this loop 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:25.530
 on it will run the feeder and now on 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:32.459
 free end 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:37.380
 but the volume that stayed doing a loop 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:42.150
 knotting too 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:46.470
 eight to this loop we will 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:55.069
 tie our leash a length of about 40 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:55.069
 80 centimeters knot too we brush off and 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.400
 delaying 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:10.410
 here 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:12.200
 no end cut off all our tooling 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:16.400
 ready 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:21.000
 very simple tackle 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:24.150
 used by those places on those ponds 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.220
 where a lot of silt equipment falls 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.410
 the feeder can submerge the mouth 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:33.799
 immerse yourself in LA 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.799
 on top we will see bite 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:47.340
 this is how it will be if you will manger 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:50.940
 she will be clearly visible bite everything to everyone 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:53.370
