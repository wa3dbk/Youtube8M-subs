00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:21.009
 of the video today I bring you one more topic 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:24.009
 for your windows 8 8.1 of 32 or 64 bits ok 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:27.699
 they are really two only change or 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:31.539
 the color varies in this case it's like gray 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:34.030
 and blue and good before you start the video 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:36.370
 I would like to ask for your help in 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.320
 can subscribe to my channel to be able to 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.290
 share and in case you have them 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.930

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:47.320
 hand up or like and with that then 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:50.080
 would bring a great milestone let's not say 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.879
 so for that I could go up more 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.920
 videos or share the videos to you 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:56.430
 to friends well now now we are going to 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.379
 boot with this little tutorial 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.750
 it really is very easy and let's start 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:03.729
 third parties in case you do not have 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.470
 patched your windows if you have patched 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:07.119
 your windows you can jump to where 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.130
 we can sit now it's more you know 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:11.799
 how, then, just download the theme and 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.240
 ready it goes well then I'm going to leave 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:14.460
 I will upload the download link to 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.409
 mega 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.380
 so they can download it and have it 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.360
 on your computer it goes very well once 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.340
 that we have the file downloaded in 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.470
 our computer will appear this 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.150
 obviously going to look like a file 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.430
 winrar we decompress it and it's going to 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.830
 be the same folder that I have and 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.649
 we will open it , it will come out 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:37.710
 this we have what is the cursor is a 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:39.720
 extra along with a twix that's what I'm going to 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.090
 show and then the subject that is no longer 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.750
 well the program which will help us 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.759
 to be able to install and use other third parties or 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.369
 unofficial microsoft in our 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:54.010
 computer ok and well here we have a 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:56.740
 preview of the topics 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:02:00.450
 What are these, he told them, was like 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:03.640
 gray and blue and can notice the change of 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.790
 the buttons of the minimized closure and 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:10.149
 then the buttons are also maximized 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:12.730
 back and forth the bar and then the 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:15.760
 information bars of the 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.430
 ok devices as well what we 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:22.460
 to do first is to install this that 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:24.620
 says style we install it 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:27.500
 we wait for you to open this little 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.260
 window we give to the cry of teams and 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:33.530
 We give in style or install really not 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:36.230
 this installation does not last long because 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:40.090
 which is this very fast as you can notice 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.090
 it is very very fast 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.170
 because it has not been such a gift to us 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.080
 we give proust means we already have 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.600
 our supposedly our windows 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.280
 patched to be able to use themes then 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.550
 alright let's go now to the folder that says 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.970
 teams 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:59.370
 let's copy these three files the 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.220
 theme and two theme applications and what 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.350
 let's go to our local disk ce and 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.110
 we go to windows we look for the folder 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:09.570
 that says of users that in this case it will be 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.090
 well and we look for another folder called 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.819
 teams and well here we are going to 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.939
 proceed to paste 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:19.459
 and charge then I have them, you are going to 

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:20.840
 paste without problem and without any error 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.420
 if you dial mistake them even if 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.879
 I doubt this one try again 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:29.750
 but I doubt that any mistake 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:33.860
 well since we have this 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:37.370
 let's say copied or pasted our three 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:39.260
 files there let's proceed to go 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.870
 back to the folder that we just 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.780
 download it the music of the course 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.970
 and we are going to look for this file that they say 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.340
 6 we are going to give you right click above 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.810
 this file and we will proceed to 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:55.040
 install 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:56.330
 we put you open click open as 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.730
 they will also see the 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:01.430
 installation we close and now we are going to 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.200
 proceed to open then well let's 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:06.590
 open up a writer and let's go to 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.940
 customize to apply the theme what 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.310
 we will find it in the in the 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:13.970
 section of installed topics and then here 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:16.599
 they are the minimal blu and the minimum pre 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.599
 to put one 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:22.389
 how is the blues like you can already notice 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.219
 the bar that changes a bit 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:26.979
 in the aspect of the windows the 

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:30.009
 buttons and then the front buttons and 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:32.050
 back and then obviously nothing else changes 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:34.300
 the color if we look for the other one too 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:38.169
 case I like it then this one 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:40.430
 ok and well we open the folder again and 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:43.910
 we look good 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:47.120
 we can occupy this tweet that only 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:49.640
 is how you can make the subject thinner 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:52.210
 or slim let's say it like that and we can 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:54.280
 enable it to disable it 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.860
 you can not tell the difference that by 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.689
 example if we give disabled 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:02.409
 we will be the window a bit more 

00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:04.960
 thick good what are the sides and 

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:08.650
 if we give enable we will be more 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:10.689
 delgadito samek armero regularly the 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.880
 that I like more slim 

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:15.340
 then I'm going to leave it like that 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:19.350
 and well this would be all from me
