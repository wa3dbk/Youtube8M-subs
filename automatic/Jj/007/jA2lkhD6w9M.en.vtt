of<00:01:41.180> another<00:01:41.540> that<00:01:42.439> one<00:01:42.740> actually<00:01:43.100> came<00:01:43.700> out

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
of another that one actually came out

upside<00:01:44.210> down<00:01:44.390> as<00:01:44.540> you<00:01:44.630> guys<00:01:44.750> are<00:01:44.780> seeing<00:01:45.140> in

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
upside down as you guys are seeing in

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.950 
upside down as you guys are seeing in
the<00:01:45.409> room<00:01:45.850> the<00:01:46.850> new<00:01:47.030> crew<00:01:47.330> was<00:01:47.540> actually

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
the room the new crew was actually

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.499 
the room the new crew was actually
teleported<00:01:48.710> to<00:01:48.740> die<00:01:49.130> rise<00:01:49.430> by<00:01:49.880> Richthofen

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
teleported to die rise by Richthofen

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:52.330 
teleported to die rise by Richthofen
which<00:01:51.020> is<00:01:51.170> something<00:01:51.500> new<00:01:51.619> that<00:01:51.830> we<00:01:51.920> learned

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
which is something new that we learned

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.399 
which is something new that we learned
Richtofen<00:01:53.000> apparently<00:01:53.689> has<00:01:53.930> the<00:01:54.080> power<00:01:54.290> to

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
Richtofen apparently has the power to

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:57.100 
Richtofen apparently has the power to
teleport<00:01:54.799> the<00:01:55.220> entire<00:01:55.520> crew<00:01:55.909> and<00:01:56.150> on<00:01:56.720> top<00:01:56.960> of

teleport the entire crew and on top of

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.410 
teleport the entire crew and on top of
that<00:01:57.229> it<00:01:57.680> seems<00:01:58.070> that<00:01:58.250> Richtofen<00:01:58.880> actually

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
that it seems that Richtofen actually

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.600 
that it seems that Richtofen actually
has<00:01:59.600> the<00:01:59.810> power<00:01:59.990> to<00:02:00.350> teleport<00:02:01.189> them<00:02:01.369> through

has the power to teleport them through
time<00:02:01.909> as<00:02:02.180> well<00:02:02.450> this<00:02:03.350> is<00:02:03.500> not<00:02:03.619> a<00:02:03.650> far-fetched

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
time as well this is not a far-fetched

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.429 
time as well this is not a far-fetched
idea<00:02:04.400> that<00:02:04.820> Richtofen<00:02:05.329> is<00:02:05.509> able<00:02:05.900> to<00:02:06.079> make<00:02:06.290> the

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 
idea that Richtofen is able to make the

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:08.859 
idea that Richtofen is able to make the
crew<00:02:06.650> travel<00:02:07.100> through<00:02:07.310> space<00:02:07.490> and<00:02:07.640> time<00:02:07.909> the

ops 2 another clue as to what time this

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.069 
ops 2 another clue as to what time this
period<00:02:58.560> might<00:02:58.739> be<00:02:58.980> is<00:02:59.730> a<00:02:59.790> picture<00:03:00.540> on<00:03:00.720> the<00:03:00.840> wall

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
period might be is a picture on the wall

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:04.539 
period might be is a picture on the wall
in<00:03:01.379> the<00:03:01.409> PDW<00:03:02.280> room<00:03:02.549> which<00:03:02.849> shows<00:03:03.150> here<00:03:04.019> since

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
in the PDW room which shows here since

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:08.210 
in the PDW room which shows here since
1996<00:03:05.810> so<00:03:06.810> we<00:03:07.019> can<00:03:07.169> draw<00:03:07.379> is<00:03:07.650> that<00:03:07.799> I<00:03:07.980> rise

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
1996 so we can draw is that I rise

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.849 
1996 so we can draw is that I rise
either<00:03:08.489> takes<00:03:08.790> place<00:03:09.090> near<00:03:09.540> 2025<00:03:10.500> but

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:10.859 
either takes place near 2025 but

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:14.210 
either takes place near 2025 but
certainly<00:03:11.639> after<00:03:12.260> 1996<00:03:13.260> although<00:03:13.829> there<00:03:14.129> is

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
certainly after 1996 although there is

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.429 
certainly after 1996 although there is
no<00:03:14.340> specific<00:03:14.879> date<00:03:15.090> the<00:03:15.419> reason<00:03:16.349> that

no specific date the reason that

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:18.559 
no specific date the reason that
Richthofen<00:03:17.010> made<00:03:17.340> the<00:03:17.549> new<00:03:17.760> crew<00:03:18.030> travelled

Richthofen made the new crew travelled
to<00:03:18.689> die<00:03:18.900> rise<00:03:19.169> is<00:03:19.500> because<00:03:20.159> he<00:03:20.310> wants<00:03:20.579> to

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
to die rise is because he wants to

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:22.520 
to die rise is because he wants to
continue<00:03:21.150> his<00:03:21.299> plan<00:03:21.510> in<00:03:21.900> order<00:03:22.139> to<00:03:22.260> restore
