00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.510
 hello today will be a video of empty 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.490
 jars talk about care products 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.710
 the hair that I ran out and 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.980
 let's start with the company dst from me 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:26.400
 Keratin Shampoo and Mask and Series 41 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.290
 and 43 these are exactly remedies for 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.330
 restore the structure of your hair 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.860
 I really like these products. 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.230
 really restore your 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:36.810
 hair they become more well-groomed and 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.750
 brilliant gorgeous foods therefore 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:41.820
 if you are looking for exactly remedies 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.190
 to care for your hair draw 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.050
 the company's focus dsd their huge 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.790
 the choice of different means is the only thing 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.040
 should they add unfortunately let's say 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:53.160
 so not democratic and at its price 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:56.300
 shampoo costs about 2000 a mask about 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.550
 three also can not say that shampoo 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:02.130
 some kind of more economical its 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.710
 use compared to others not 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:07.080
 that is, this volume of shampoo was not enough 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.790
 bring for a month and a half that's it 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.560
 the mask is really very economical 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.380
 its use of this volume to me 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.579
 enough for 3 months 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.170
 the products are really great 

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:19.770
 pay your attention and with pleasure 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.219
 Buy them again 2 products that I 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.259
 I wanted to tell this shampoo from 

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:30.539
 companies lash is called big why 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:33.179
 there in translation is called the ocean . highly 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:34.740
 strange it is shampoo for deep 

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:36.749
 cleansing your hair 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.600
 that is, by such means naturally not 

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:41.819
 use every day they are not only 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.600
 wash off let's say some pollution on 

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:46.390
 your hair 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:49.060
 they wash out exactly the excess 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.670
 lay-up measures or masks with 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:55.330
 your hair therefore this shampoo I 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:58.750
 use once a week sometimes even 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:01.119
 once a fortnight it looks like this 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.180
 here it is as if you are 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:06.820
 sea â€‹â€‹salt but when you put this 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.590
 shampoo wet hair and start them 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.620
 cut it turns into a normal 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.810
 shampoo it is really very good 

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:15.310
 washes hair I can say a little 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.170
 dries hair 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.360
 but since really shampoo for 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.570
 deep cleansing after you 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.950
 apply a mask or conditioner absolutely 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.989
 no problem no hair 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.900
 really become more voluminous 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:32.560
 more fluffy wonderful tool 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.300
 I love him very much this is probably 2 packaging 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.200
 and in the near future I plan to buy 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.700
 third so pay your attention 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.739
 the third product which is not like that 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:46.000
 disappointed if I honestly did not understand 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:49.239
 why is he so called vitamins for 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.760
 hair that you are using this one 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:54.850
 polarizers are sprayed distributed 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.400
 homemade hair recipes 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.560
 honestly what if you see this 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.570
 product and pour ordinary water there and 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.750
 there will always be the same absolutely no 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:08.049
 I do not understand why you want it 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.870
 it is written that it contains rosehip oil 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:12.640
 and I do not know that it contains it absolutely 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.790
 unfortunately stupid products even 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.950
 despite the fact that it's worth it let's say not 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.950
 more than a hundred rubles but for the money 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.049
 buy yourself aramis chocolate 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.910
 you will get much more 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:27.150
 pleasure to use 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.590
 if I didn't like her at all 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:32.650
 second remedy which is surprising 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:35.590
 I was disappointed though she is from the firm 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:38.080
 farther guard and rene furterer i 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.000
 I like it very much 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.700
 products I really like and 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.440
 it can even say the first remedy for 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.260
 firms time farther which me 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:50.290
 disappointed it shampoo for thin 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.360
 hair to give them volume well I can 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.030
 say that no amount it gives 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:59.170
 and in fact absolutely mediocre 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:00.790
 shampoo well this is really the first 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.680
 internet drug remedy which to me 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.930
 disappointed and therefore recommend i 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.180
 you can't buy him either 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.830
 there will be a last resort which I 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.100
 I wanted to tell you today is 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:13.840
 serum from the company altera on which 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.989
 aimed at again at 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.989
 restoring the structure of your hair 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:23.260
 I liked it very much in the first place 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:26.830
 what does hair really become 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:29.380
 more elastic and that's it tips 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.910
 being restored and so the most important thing 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.980
 that I liked it like her 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:35.860
 used you do not need to allocate 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:39.250
 some time during the day to go with a mask 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:41.140
 Like this mask is applied at night then 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:44.370
 have you not washing your hair 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:47.260
 you put on dry hair 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:49.000
 mostly of course at your tips 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.820
 hair this means and go to bed 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.300
 wake up in the morning and put in the wash 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.530
 hair styled as usual 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:59.050
 Great product is very convenient 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:01.380
 I recommend everyone to recommend it with great 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:04.530
 enjoyed and plan 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.840
