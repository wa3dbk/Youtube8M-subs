00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:13.500
 I'm sure the dream is of all 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:15.059
 our viewers to own a horse I 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.440
 didn't used to be when I was younger 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.480
 always had my own horse I have 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.699
 always had a few of others 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.350
 people who can borrow or who can 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.490
 I just used 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.900
 and that way I have a lot 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.189
 experience gained with different 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.119
 horses and that's how I got my first one 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.519
 competed 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.750

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.640
 bought with it have my parents 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.960

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.370
 pictures of 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.700
 of course I already had some experience back then 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.100
 I started so this was a younger pony 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.170
 this one is called in and so I have a whole one 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.700
 folder with all things collected 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.170

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.059
 match results 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.340

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.199
 mother is also and I have every horse 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.600

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.550
 also with all pictures in it so that we 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.079
 have you seen my first 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.609
 own pony 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.350
 and then I'm going to give you tips about it now 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.690
 how you can purchase amounts yourself 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.979
 and first of all the biggest tip is you 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.510
 looking for a good one 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.400
 supervisor who can help you with it 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.710
 buy a horse and that is whole 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.299
 important because very often mistakes 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.890
 be made with sure if you haven't 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.900
 have so much experience buying one 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.189
 partner if it is your own horse it is 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.110
 very important that someone can do you 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.979
 help looking and accept that with him 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.229
 suits 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.000
 a good companion is you, for example 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.290
 teaching and in my case loved it 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.810
 my mother who has been with me 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.610
 to buy a few de and you can 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.540
 nowadays even hire someone for it 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.829
 buying your horse 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.270
 after you ate a good companion 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.400
 found it is important that you go 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.780
 consider what kind of horse you want and 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.430
 it goes beyond just four legs 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.500
 a tail anyway, for example , pay attention 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.150
 in what was the horse use 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.570
 chair experience 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:48.030
 age height gender and of course 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.500
 what your budget is if it's really me first 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.820
 a few it is therefore wise to have one 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.720
 few to take an average 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.250
 Age 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.780
 so no young horse because that is really one 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.240
 whole job separately and then you have much more 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.100
 experience needed and not too 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.600
 old horse that you have to assume that 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.250
 you might go your horse again 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.619
 For example if you sell the big one 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:08.910
 need a horse for your first horse 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:10.119
 age from 7 to 12 would be good 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.099
 then the size 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.750
 of your horse and it is important that you 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:15.040
 first consider if you like a horse or 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.870
 a pony tail 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.760
 and you can still join the 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.409
 riding ponies is often very pleasant 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.940
 and those matches are very nice me 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:23.349
 find the pony club 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.989
 but you so you abolish a pony 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:27.519
 which come in different sizes and as 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.690
 you are still growing you are natural 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:29.739
 important that you take that into account 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.569
 because otherwise you might be 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.739
 within a year from your pony or grown 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:35.200
 and that is of course sun 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:37.000
 I obviously males mate so save 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.069
 and this important that you also think 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.260
 about the gender of the horse as the 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.450
 first horse is it wise to 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.340
 no scary to take tom hanks is often something 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.470
 harder and fun this is a job 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.410
 separately you need more experience and 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.930
 an exchange is often easy and yes 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.579
 can use for many things and you 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.890
 can also possibly take a mare as 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:58.959
 you put on your socks and 50's and lots 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.340
 of course have different levels 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.349
 you can have horses that are whole 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.730
 driven a lot of experience in sport 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:05.349
 have already done many matches 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.760
 and of course horses too 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:08.650
 for example, have a lot of experience 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.390
 in outings in that really very good 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.129
 and it is important that you consider 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.870
 what you want and it really is that 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:14.440
 first horse then it is wise to 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.299
 a 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.980
 school horse to purchase his horse what 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.810
 or has experience with a quiet 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.430
 character and that if you for example 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.859
 wants to ride competitions even high in the 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.500
 sport text if you run very high 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:28.169
 sport jos really jump dutch 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.269
 championships and such 

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:33.010
 for example, views do not pick up like that 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:34.810
 very suitable for or may mine 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.590
 partner 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.510
 rough such wash please 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.670
 third house was forgotten we must be me 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.849
 also look for drinking hupsakee 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.440
 film died for example am 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:48.090
 yes I do not call him what a fjord horse 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.830
 so very suitable and you can look better 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.750
 go to a horse that is attached for 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:54.120
 for example the jumping sport it is too 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.830
 wise couple not very hot 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.090
 as the first horse is in your will 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.739
 like something quieter that you don't have 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.150
 thoroughbred arab 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.830
 because they are often more difficult 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.379
 but that you are just a breed living what 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:06.569
 quieter December suits you too I do 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:08.640
 Gone was the question of what a horse costs 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:11.579
 but you can't just answer that 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.989
 because small shetlanders give you what you want 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:15.690
 socializing often costs 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:17.430
 makes much less than a great sport and 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.590
 I consciously chose it or the last one 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.660
 because it is wiser to fix first 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.070
 to set what you want and then there 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.020
 to watch from that goes to 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.490
 about as many costs 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.110
 and if you only want a very small budget 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.000
 but you really want a big one 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.979
 sports card then you better a little longer 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.510
 by saving to end up with one 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:35.729
 choose what you want 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:37.289
 when you figured out what kind of what you want 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:38.340
 then you naturally look for one 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:40.440
 horse and then you can go on different 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.600
 ways you can go for example 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.760
 a well-written 3 misto go and 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.169
 they often have fewer pairs for sale 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.910
 you can buy a horse from private individuals 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:49.889
 buy that can be done through various websites 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.360
 I'll also show you that later 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:53.039
 it is also possible with and so-called 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.740
 commissioner and that is actually one 

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:58.289
 kind of broker for couple so then 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.820
 the guidance that will help you get started 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:00.810
 search and horses that suit you 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.070
 to wish 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.570
 I just told you if you were one 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.620
 couple will look for that you can do that 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.240
 at a training stable 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.639
 or at a broker but there are 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.580
 also two very useful websites for this 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:13.500
 is, for example, sporthorses punt nl 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.940
 on this website you can choose whether you 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.490
 are looking for a horse or a pony 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:21.450
 I would like a horse between the ages of 7 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:22.689
 and 12 and level or higher 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:25.299
 spacious I think 

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:27.699
 for example, I can tailor this 

00:05:25.299 --> 00:05:29.499
 and so I am quite tall and 

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:31.059
 i know of myself that i have big horses 

00:05:29.499 --> 00:05:33.789
 should like that 

00:05:31.059 --> 00:05:35.619
 so I go for height above 1 meter 

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:37.389
 65 

00:05:35.619 --> 00:05:39.360
 I have no preference for one by one 

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:42.249
 breeds for a studbook say 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:44.019
 video ads were at State 

00:05:42.249 --> 00:05:45.819
 are very handy then you can already see 

00:05:44.019 --> 00:05:47.769
 how a horse moves and your horses out 

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:49.629
 and it is also very handy to have this 

00:05:47.769 --> 00:05:51.219
 to do together with your supervisor or to 

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:52.929
 a horse what you have found by 

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:55.779
 mail to your supervisor and that is possible 

00:05:52.929 --> 00:05:58.319
 for example we have seen this go 

00:05:55.779 --> 00:05:58.319
 We are a marketplace 

00:05:59.619 --> 00:06:03.809
 they had a brown and set 

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:08.190
 and 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.919
 when you have a number of horses 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.879
 found that you like then you go 

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:15.650
 look at it naturally 

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:16.970
 and who will look at what kind of character they are 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:18.860
 have one goes on of course 

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:19.610
 you have to travel a few times 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:20.840
 to attempt 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:22.250
 you go to a few different ones 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.139
 watching horses is very important 

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:26.539
 because that way you find out what 

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:28.639
 you fine, and for your work and I 

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:30.349
 know for example from experience that I 

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:31.789
 find a big horse stijn 

00:06:30.349 --> 00:06:34.099
 is sturdy and for example I have one 

00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:36.289
 preference for gelding on stallions 

00:06:34.099 --> 00:06:37.849
 did you find a horse what you 

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:39.530
 very much like you have a few 

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:41.629
 tried it out once and you are sure 

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:43.639
 this is going to be your horse then you go 

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:45.440
 not directly about the purchase but 

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:47.509
 it's wise to have it tested first 

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:49.219
 at the vet check at the 

00:06:47.509 --> 00:06:50.990
 Vet that actually means that 

00:06:49.219 --> 00:06:53.000
 veterinarian doing a few tests to 

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:54.949
 see if the horse is healthy and that 

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.610
 can be clinical so those are real 

00:06:54.949 --> 00:06:57.199
 particular 

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:59.360
 but you can do that too 

00:06:57.199 --> 00:07:01.250
 having it done radiographically means 

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:03.139
 that the vet takes pictures of it 

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:04.819
 horse and see if it is healthy inside 

00:07:03.139 --> 00:07:06.740
 is that can happen to you for example 

00:07:04.819 --> 00:07:07.969
 horse or damage that you put on 

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:10.340
 the first moment 

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:12.020
 can't see but later on up 

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:14.300
 it is of course super sin like 

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:15.469
 you buy a sick horse by accident or 

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.630
 a few falls after a few months 

00:07:15.469 --> 00:07:19.039
 lame is your horse approved then 

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:21.020
 you can proceed to the purchase 

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:23.509
 this is so barigo this is my own 

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:26.029
 horse and of course I bought it 

00:07:23.509 --> 00:07:27.620
 along with tips that I just told 

00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:29.360
 and well i am color happy with now 

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:31.190
 perrineau and certainly prints like you 

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:33.440
 all tips or dry that you just so 

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:35.210
 going to be happy talking to you and having it 

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:37.219
 you yourself a very good tip or is 

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:39.020
 something you really all the most important 

00:07:37.219 --> 00:07:40.370
 finds when purchasing a horse 

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:42.919
 definitely leave it in the comments 

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:44.270
 behind and ducked a thumb used for 

00:07:42.919 --> 00:07:46.400
 looking and next week 

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:48.409
 nevertheless have just shown naturally 

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.759
 how is that with the left canter with is 

00:07:48.409 --> 00:07:51.319
 naturally also useful as we show 

00:07:49.759 --> 00:07:52.279
 how you can see your rights 

00:07:51.319 --> 00:07:53.479
 canter 

00:07:52.279 --> 00:07:56.800
 but for that we need that 

00:07:53.479 --> 00:07:56.800
 change colored bondages
