00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:22.880
 very good two we are going well here mysterium 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:25.430
 I go what you just saw is an ipad 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.170
 here flipeis is the teaser 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.450
 that appears at the end of the movie 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.800
 spit that is so talked about this 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.720
 new pokémon that is talked about so much 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.059
 since the movie comes out finally 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.620
 someone has gone to see her at the cinema in japan 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:39.530
 and it has been recorded and filtered and here 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.510
 you have it and as you can see 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.710
 clearly it's the pokemon that all the 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.170
 world talks about that everyone had 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.120
 made little drawings that if you fan out almost things 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.070
 Well, now we have it in the flesh and 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.260
 bone I can no longer but officially as 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.690
 is going to be already you have it is a little curious 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.670
 not because it's a bit too small and I do not know 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.710
 it does not look good well a pokémon but 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.360
 good always the new ones because no 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.519
 they seem a bit but in this case this 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.100
 it's like very small so they do not have anything 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:05.930
 in particular and then we see in the new 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.610
 form is of giant we do not know well what 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.280
 what is it but what has been confirmed 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.560
 things like for example that the monster 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.960
 this giant has like the full body 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.900
 of some flakes like that in hexagons plan 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.460
 similar to wings that you have and 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.500
 garde so they have all the 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.240
 possibilities of it being the new way 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.840
 to fix this kid this 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.109
 tiny 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:30.200
 nothing at all, nothing at all 

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:32.539
 we know it's red and green, I've lost 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.679
 with the chest so a little red if it is 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:35.929
 that can be called chest to that 

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:37.159
 then what is going to be then they have all 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:38.899
 it looks like it's going to be the new one because 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:42.380
 where it is is seventh generation 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:44.509
 forgiveness in which good always in 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.850
 the pokemon movies in the last 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:48.740
 copy of the pokemon movie are usually 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.899
 teach a pokémon of the next 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.329
 generation then it could be that it 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:55.459
 out in one of the first pokemon of 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:57.679
 seventh generation then I guess that 

00:01:55.459 --> 00:02:00.709
 it would be a little bit a bit legendary 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:02.329
 but it's a little curious it does not look 

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:04.250
 will be without plan tour chiffelle tracks 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:06.349
 they made little ones or things like that but 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.299
 I do not know the same as in a new way with 

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:10.970
 something like that but you can not see anything 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:14.360
 more we only have this image of the end 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.160
 of the iupa not to miss the teaser of 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.660
 next year's movie but hey 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.400
 until next year we do not know anything 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.890
 of this movie and I guess they will go 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.299
 revealing new information about whether it's going 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.660
 to be a seventh generation or I do not know what 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:27.950
 but well let's talk about more things 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.240
 because we have here the new way of 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.010
 look at you 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.470
 we have already seen the trailer and we have seen 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:37.070
 that has a scream and when the 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:39.920
 title of pokemon the movie 2016 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.810
 appears in green with which it gives more foot 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.730
 to make it a new way to quote from 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.760
 Well, mediation is a form 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.320
 primigenia can be an unleashed form 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.780
 we do not know but what we do know is 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:54.020
 criticize the very low states 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.250
 has 600 status and other pokemon like 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.600
 can be the tub that is the 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.300
 fourth generation and also had a 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.190
 new form in pokémon platinum is from 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.380
 pearl diamond and then in platinum had 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:06.440
 a new way but it has some stands 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.310
 much greater then 680 of these in 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.920
 base 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.930
 and 600 of girls require 3 660 with what 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.790
 which is something that gives a lot to think about 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.430
 it may be the new form then 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.560
 we have the two attacks these are 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.240
 there what the fuck are you going that 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.160
 we have programs with which we have 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.260
 managed to create pokémons and see that 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.630
 had these two attacks that are a thousand 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.310
 tremors and a thousand arrows but really 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.750
 we have not worked out how you can 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.540
 get in the game officially 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.730
 whereupon it could lead to it coming out 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.860
 a new way of playing and what 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.480
 there were these two new attacks the 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.940
 which are a pass and that are very 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:45.170
 handsome but good we do not know not what 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:47.209
 we know so good that we have volcano 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.940
 and a volcano jon that cojones happens with 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:52.010
 volcanoes very truck is a pokémon this 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.049
 legendary water fire not that is like 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.750
 a plan the uncle is not a trio but 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:58.099
 form a kind of with julián yes but 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.129
 volcanoes we know nothing and do not know 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:03.700
 they wrote down how you can get it but in 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:06.230
 the description of whether green is said to 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:09.470
 if green appears when some 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.360
 alteration of the ecosystem and the volcano in 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.640
 this pokemon that from which not yet 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.770
 you know nothing 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.810
 It is what makes or made like 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:18.190
 uses his attacks to be able to 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.450
 ecosystem that is still then 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.090
 it may be that the next movie 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:24.850
 jon volcano appeared bursting the car 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:27.250
 and see you appear with a new form 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.080
 and they will start or start and start 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.120
 of that the seventh generation from 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.970
 that movie I do not know but it would be 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.860
 final chick then we have to 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.960
 tell you to get on the front 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.180
 where he was chasing volcano Jon and 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:43.300
 he found it in heat but and giotto or 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:45.250
 that they have already put on in these games in 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.440
 ruby or mega and sapphire to funk since 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.270
 is one of the characters has already 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.100
 found to capsize and now seen so 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.450
 which are we going to have a volcano 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.340
 obviously we are not going to stay in 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:56.350
 we will have this pokemon but only 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.870
 it is known that this this character in 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:00.310
 a challenge he has seen but good too 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.380
 as I said the last movie 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:05.350
 there always comes something that the next 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:07.600
 generation like the movie can be 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:09.400
 only arc that came out or was it from 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.290
 fourth generation and appeared zoroark and 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.870
 zorba that is from the fifth generation or 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:16.419
 as the user and the mystery of my 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.320
 game that was called that came out in 2005 and 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:19.120
 the game 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.070
 of fourth generation that were lost from 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.230
 mante came out in the following year so 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:25.750
 good is something they usually do but 

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:27.430
 good that more things well we also have 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.440
 if you remember the video that the one that says of 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.510
 the possible ones of emails of seeing of eyes 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.220
 fire reds on which I relied on the 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:37.150
 chapters these that take specials from 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:39.100
 mega evolution that the title is the mega 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.470
 evolution has a number always part 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:44.500
 1 1 2 3 and 4 not so a quarter had 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:46.480
 those colors red and green which I 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.070
 I said that they can be so diverse ariza 

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.020
 and it was a bit unlikely but I wanted to 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:52.030
 teach then the mega evolutions 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:54.280
 basically what comes to be singing 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:58.930
 but in this case 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:06:00.970
 red and green are the colors of this 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:04.060
 new pokémon the little boy with his 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:05.590
 colors is not green with the red chest 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:08.050
 so basically they are their colors and 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:09.760
 It may be that he will unveil this new 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:11.650
 pokémon but of course mega blues has to 

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:13.660
 be something more related to mega 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:15.580
 evolution basically so it could be 

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:19.030
 also what is that green outside for a cig 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:21.070
 art and that what will show out good 

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:22.480
 this mega evolved we do not know how 

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:25.090
 call her but this new way of quoting 

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:27.760
 so we do not know what can be 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:30.550
 but well then finally we have a 

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:33.340
 very rare thing not the last data that 

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:35.620
 we have something very strange that is that in 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:39.160
 pokémon xd and there is a backpacker there 

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:41.070
 is in which is an object called 

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:43.500
 these rare footprints 

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:45.510
 that you do not know at all that this 

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:47.550
 figurine absolutely absolutely nothing 

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:49.020
 so what is this for? 

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:50.970
 have some kind of sense because never 

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:53.340
 an object so unique by third 

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:54.720
 somehow they have given it to you and not 

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:55.890
 served for nothing is always for something 

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.480
 I who know the vessel of punishment also 

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:59.490
 it's a very unique object that says that 

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:00.960
 cojones is this ok but then when 

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:02.910
 you find out that it's good to play because 

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:06.020
 it would be a bitch because is is like yours 

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:08.400
 rare may it serve to evolve to 

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:10.470
 apply to you to unleash your form or to 

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:12.690
 the new pokémon does not know well 

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:14.670
 because the truth does not have any 

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:16.920
 resemblance to no pokemon no I do not know no 

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:19.410
 I know what it may look good but the 

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:21.300
 true that good something has to have 

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:23.100
 something that has to have so good 

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:24.510
 So far this video I hope you have 

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:26.250
 liked leave me the comments what 

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:27.870
 you think about this new pokémon that is 

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:29.100
 a little one but to do a lot in 

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:32.100
 pokemon I've said it before but good 

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:33.420
 and give your opinion about a 

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:35.730
 new form the end of all these 

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:38.430
 indexes that you can say that either 

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:39.900
 get out of here those that have to be that 

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:41.490
 because they have for cojones has to be 

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:44.310
 a new sixth generation game but 

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:45.900
 we have the doubt that if from this 

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:46.760
 new pokémon of this new pokémon no 

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:50.090
 I believe that 

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:51.290
 a new completely new Pokémon what 

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:52.700
 they carry in a sixth generation game 

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:55.220
 when this will be the seventh generation 

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:57.290
 well then I'm not sure what the hell they go 

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:59.030
 to do without fusion a fusion of Carlos 

00:07:57.290 --> 00:08:00.410
 leave that generation with the new 

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:02.270
 seventh generation a game in which 

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:05.660
 include these two new ones the good 

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:07.850
 last and the new generation and region or 

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:09.500
 I know I do not know I do not know what can 

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:11.240
 can do so by telling me in what 

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:12.890

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:14.450
