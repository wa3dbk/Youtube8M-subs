this<00:03:34.260> scale<00:03:34.560> except<00:03:34.860> they<00:03:35.010> weren't<00:03:35.190> as<00:03:35.340> well

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:35.520 
this scale except they weren't as well

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.460 
this scale except they weren't as well
so<00:03:35.819> it's<00:03:36.420> gonna<00:03:36.810> make<00:03:36.989> it<00:03:37.080> a<00:03:37.140> little<00:03:37.260> bit

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
so it's gonna make it a little bit

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:38.870 
so it's gonna make it a little bit
difficult<00:03:37.620> for<00:03:37.860> you<00:03:38.069> if<00:03:38.130> you<00:03:38.250> want<00:03:38.489> to<00:03:38.610> get<00:03:38.760> an

going to grab this guy that's for sure

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.360 
going to grab this guy that's for sure
it<00:03:51.959> comes<00:03:52.110> with<00:03:52.260> two<00:03:52.410> peg<00:03:52.650> holes<00:03:52.920> on<00:03:53.099> the<00:03:53.220> back

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
it comes with two peg holes on the back

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.309 
it comes with two peg holes on the back
you<00:03:54.120> don't<00:03:54.650> we<00:03:55.650> can<00:03:56.040> basically<00:03:56.280> move<00:03:56.730> that<00:03:57.319> gun

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
you don't we can basically move that gun

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:00.350 
you don't we can basically move that gun
the<00:03:58.560> component<00:03:59.130> around<00:03:59.430> let<00:04:00.000> me<00:04:00.030> give<00:04:00.209> you<00:04:00.300> a

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
the component around let me give you a

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.490 
the component around let me give you a
little<00:04:00.569> bit<00:04:00.660> of<00:04:00.690> a<00:04:00.780> closer<00:04:01.019> look<00:04:01.319> at<00:04:01.470> that

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
little bit of a closer look at that

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.059 
little bit of a closer look at that
there<00:04:01.970> so<00:04:02.970> it's<00:04:03.090> not<00:04:03.150> a<00:04:03.299> swivel<00:04:03.840> hook<00:04:04.769> clear

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
there so it's not a swivel hook clear

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:08.059 
there so it's not a swivel hook clear
and<00:04:05.310> you'll<00:04:05.400> also<00:04:05.640> see<00:04:05.940> a<00:04:05.970> hinge<00:04:06.560> so<00:04:07.560> it<00:04:07.799> seems

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069 
and you'll also see a hinge so it seems

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:09.680 
and you'll also see a hinge so it seems
a<00:04:08.160> little<00:04:08.250> miss<00:04:08.549> Elaine<00:04:08.850> to<00:04:09.090> me<00:04:09.239> I<00:04:09.269> think<00:04:09.540> in

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
a little miss Elaine to me I think in

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.420 
a little miss Elaine to me I think in
some<00:04:09.870> ways<00:04:09.900> that<00:04:10.260> perhaps<00:04:10.470> should<00:04:10.799> be<00:04:10.860> molded

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
some ways that perhaps should be molded

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.940 
some ways that perhaps should be molded
with<00:04:12.269> a<00:04:12.330> peg<00:04:12.690> on<00:04:12.840> the<00:04:12.900> other<00:04:13.170> side<00:04:13.470> and<00:04:13.709> moved

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
with a peg on the other side and moved

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.350 
with a peg on the other side and moved
around<00:04:14.069> it<00:04:14.430> seems<00:04:14.610> a<00:04:14.670> little<00:04:14.760> off-kilter

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
around it seems a little off-kilter

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.140 
around it seems a little off-kilter
there<00:04:15.720> but<00:04:16.010> look<00:04:17.010> at<00:04:17.130> what<00:04:17.340> you'll<00:04:17.729> see<00:04:17.910> if<00:04:18.030> I

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
there but look at what you'll see if I

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:19.729 
there but look at what you'll see if I
move<00:04:18.359> it<00:04:18.479> around<00:04:18.570> so<00:04:18.780> that<00:04:18.840> I<00:04:18.959> said<00:04:19.229> it's<00:04:19.620> a

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
move it around so that I said it's a

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.900 
move it around so that I said it's a
little<00:04:20.010> bit<00:04:20.160> more<00:04:20.489> in<00:04:22.040> line<00:04:23.040> with<00:04:23.070> how<00:04:23.850> it

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
little bit more in line with how it

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.600 
little bit more in line with how it
should<00:04:24.210> be<00:04:24.450> so<00:04:24.860> of<00:04:25.860> course<00:04:26.130> she<00:04:26.220> was<00:04:26.370> going<00:04:26.520> on

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
should be so of course she was going on

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.250 
should be so of course she was going on
there<00:04:26.790> but<00:04:27.080> it<00:04:28.080> works<00:04:28.350> so<00:04:29.240> we<00:04:30.240> get<00:04:30.390> this<00:04:30.600> gun

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
there but it works so we get this gun

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.740 
there but it works so we get this gun
placement<00:04:31.860> on<00:04:32.460> Rudy<00:04:32.970> there<00:04:33.120> you'll<00:04:33.390> see<00:04:33.630> all

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
placement on Rudy there you'll see all

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.850 
placement on Rudy there you'll see all
the<00:04:33.870> detail<00:04:34.260> on<00:04:34.500> ease<00:04:35.900> the<00:04:36.900> gun<00:04:37.080> itself<00:04:37.440> it's

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
the detail on ease the gun itself it's

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.230 
the detail on ease the gun itself it's
pretty<00:04:38.280> straightforward<00:04:38.669> and<00:04:40.760> pretty<00:04:41.760> solid

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
pretty straightforward and pretty solid

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.920 
pretty straightforward and pretty solid
too<00:04:42.510> so<00:04:42.840> even<00:04:43.110> younger<00:04:43.620> kids<00:04:44.360> won't<00:04:45.360> have<00:04:45.600> too

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
too so even younger kids won't have too

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.390 
too so even younger kids won't have too
much<00:04:46.050> of<00:04:46.110> a<00:04:46.260> problem<00:04:46.500> they<00:04:46.650> went<00:04:46.830> down

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
much of a problem they went down

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.900 
much of a problem they went down
easily<00:04:48.470> so<00:04:49.470> rotates<00:04:49.949> and<00:04:50.160> moves<00:04:50.190> around<00:04:50.430> and

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
easily so rotates and moves around and

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:52.249 
easily so rotates and moves around and
bands<00:04:51.150> so<00:04:51.389> there's<00:04:51.570> plenty<00:04:51.690> of<00:04:51.900> movement<00:04:52.229> on

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:52.259 
bands so there's plenty of movement on

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:55.700 
bands so there's plenty of movement on
that<00:04:52.320> you<00:04:52.560> can<00:04:52.740> stay<00:04:53.040> like<00:04:53.190> positive<00:04:54.350> you<00:04:55.350> just

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
that you can stay like positive you just

look badass
so<00:04:57.660> the<00:04:57.840> lords<00:04:58.110> of<00:04:58.169> articulation<00:04:58.800> on<00:04:58.919> this<00:04:59.100> guy

evolved right there with the hinge you
can<00:05:22.260> see<00:05:22.470> that<00:05:22.620> there's<00:05:22.830> a<00:05:23.010> full<00:05:23.280> 360<00:05:23.880> movement

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
can see that there's a full 360 movement

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:29.330 
can see that there's a full 360 movement
you'll<00:05:24.780> see<00:05:25.139> on<00:05:25.380> the<00:05:27.650> say<00:05:28.650> that<00:05:28.860> the<00:05:28.919> elbow

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 
you'll see on the say that the elbow

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.010 
you'll see on the say that the elbow
there<00:05:29.520> four<00:05:29.729> ton<00:05:29.940> that<00:05:30.060> arraigned<00:05:30.360> he's

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 
there four ton that arraigned he's

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.840 
there four ton that arraigned he's
double-jointed<00:05:31.710> elbows

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:32.850 
double-jointed elbows

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:34.730 
double-jointed elbows
so<00:05:33.060> again<00:05:33.630> loads<00:05:33.930> and<00:05:34.139> loads<00:05:34.169> of<00:05:34.380> movement<00:05:34.710> on

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
so again loads and loads of movement on

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.439 
so again loads and loads of movement on
now<00:05:34.889> which<00:05:35.039> really<00:05:35.340> helps<00:05:35.699> consider<00:05:36.090> there's

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:36.449 
now which really helps consider there's

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:38.779 
now which really helps consider there's
a<00:05:37.050> lot<00:05:37.650> of<00:05:37.770> armor<00:05:38.039> on<00:05:38.070> the<00:05:38.250> figure<00:05:38.520> so<00:05:38.580> it's<00:05:38.729> a

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:38.789 
a lot of armor on the figure so it's a

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:40.730 
a lot of armor on the figure so it's a
little<00:05:38.970> difficult<00:05:39.360> to<00:05:39.389> move<00:05:39.539> and<00:05:39.780> one<00:05:40.289> place

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
little difficult to move and one place

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.710 
little difficult to move and one place
where<00:05:40.949> you<00:05:41.070> can<00:05:41.220> see<00:05:41.430> the<00:05:41.550> difficulty<00:05:41.940> to<00:05:42.449> move

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 
where you can see the difficulty to move

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.020 
where you can see the difficulty to move
is<00:05:42.870> on<00:05:43.320> the<00:05:43.680> rest<00:05:43.949> there<00:05:44.280> there's<00:05:44.610> actually<00:05:44.729> a

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.030 
is on the rest there there's actually a

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.510 
is on the rest there there's actually a
joint<00:05:45.360> which<00:05:45.509> allows<00:05:45.660> the<00:05:46.259> rest<00:05:46.860> to<00:05:47.130> go<00:05:47.280> back

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 
joint which allows the rest to go back

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.370 
joint which allows the rest to go back
but<00:05:47.849> obviously<00:05:48.270> because<00:05:48.750> of<00:05:48.780> this<00:05:48.990> piece<00:05:49.259> of

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:49.380 
but obviously because of this piece of

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.140 
but obviously because of this piece of
arm<00:05:49.560> on<00:05:49.680> the<00:05:49.740> front<00:05:49.949> it<00:05:50.340> restricts<00:05:50.789> it<00:05:50.970> so<00:05:51.090> you

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.150 
arm on the front it restricts it so you

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.020 
arm on the front it restricts it so you
can<00:05:51.539> however<00:05:51.810> get<00:05:52.650> hand<00:05:53.039> to<00:05:53.340> go<00:05:53.520> a<00:05:53.550> little<00:05:53.849> bit

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.030 
can however get hand to go a little bit

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.240 
can however get hand to go a little bit
forward<00:05:54.270> the<00:05:54.539> Eagle<00:05:54.900> if<00:05:55.110> you<00:05:55.199> understand<00:05:55.650> you

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250 
forward the Eagle if you understand you

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:59.270 
forward the Eagle if you understand you
can<00:05:56.430> make<00:05:57.300> a<00:05:57.330> punch<00:05:57.750> there<00:05:57.979> so<00:05:58.979> it's<00:05:59.099> a<00:05:59.160> little

00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 
can make a punch there so it's a little

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.710 
can make a punch there so it's a little
bit<00:05:59.490> limiting<00:05:59.910> with<00:06:00.060> armor<00:06:00.360> but<00:06:00.510> keeps

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 
bit limiting with armor but keeps

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.510 
bit limiting with armor but keeps
everything<00:06:01.139> it's<00:06:01.349> got<00:06:01.470> so<00:06:01.680> much<00:06:01.830> arm<00:06:02.099> on<00:06:02.250> under

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:02.520 
everything it's got so much arm on under

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.820 
everything it's got so much arm on under
still<00:06:02.789> plenty<00:06:03.180> room<00:06:03.539> here<00:06:03.780> so<00:06:03.810> as<00:06:04.590> I<00:06:04.680> said

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830 
still plenty room here so as I said

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.170 
still plenty room here so as I said
double<00:06:05.070> joint<00:06:05.280> on<00:06:05.430> the<00:06:05.460> elbows<00:06:05.880> gives<00:06:06.060> it

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.180 
double joint on the elbows gives it

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.120 
double joint on the elbows gives it
plate<00:06:06.419> and<00:06:06.690> movement<00:06:07.020> on<00:06:07.110> the<00:06:07.349> torso<00:06:07.919> even

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:08.130 
plate and movement on the torso even

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:09.680 
plate and movement on the torso even
modes<00:06:08.490> of<00:06:08.639> movement<00:06:08.940> as<00:06:09.000> well<00:06:09.120> click<00:06:09.479> trim

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:09.690 
modes of movement as well click trim

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:13.390 
modes of movement as well click trim
like<00:06:09.930> an<00:06:10.020> old<00:06:10.760> pro<00:06:11.760> Android<00:06:12.150> from<00:06:12.389> Star<00:06:12.960> Wars

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:13.400 
like an old pro Android from Star Wars

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.219 
like an old pro Android from Star Wars
so<00:06:14.400> pointing<00:06:14.820> up<00:06:14.880> movement<00:06:15.270> there<00:06:15.479> on<00:06:16.020> the

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:16.229 
so pointing up movement there on the

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:18.140 
so pointing up movement there on the
hips<00:06:16.409> you'll<00:06:16.680> see<00:06:16.889> ball<00:06:17.310> joint<00:06:17.639> with<00:06:17.849> a<00:06:17.940> hinge

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:18.150 
hips you'll see ball joint with a hinge

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.330 
hips you'll see ball joint with a hinge
or<00:06:18.539> append<00:06:19.199> on<00:06:19.440> there<00:06:19.650> were<00:06:19.710> steps<00:06:19.949> I<00:06:20.159> should

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:20.340 
or append on there were steps I should

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:23.570 
or append on there were steps I should
say<00:06:20.520> and<00:06:21.120> on<00:06:21.810> the<00:06:21.960> knees<00:06:22.190> double<00:06:23.190> jointed

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:23.580 
say and on the knees double jointed

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:23.839 
say and on the knees double jointed
knees

00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:23.849 
knees

00:06:23.849 --> 00:06:26.740 
knees
I<00:06:24.120> believe<00:06:24.510> this<00:06:24.630> double<00:06:24.870> jointed<00:06:25.169> bitters

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:26.750 
I believe this double jointed bitters

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:29.450 
I believe this double jointed bitters
you<00:06:27.750> see<00:06:28.110> that<00:06:28.260> W<00:06:28.680> joined<00:06:28.919> up<00:06:29.039> on<00:06:29.130> there<00:06:29.280> so

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:29.460 
you see that W joined up on there so

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:31.610 
you see that W joined up on there so
again<00:06:29.669> plenty<00:06:30.300> of<00:06:30.389> movement<00:06:30.630> again<00:06:31.139> consider

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:31.620 
again plenty of movement again consider

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:34.040 
again plenty of movement again consider
lots<00:06:31.830> of<00:06:31.949> armor<00:06:32.300> plenty<00:06:33.300> movement<00:06:33.720> for<00:06:33.960> them

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.050 
lots of armor plenty movement for them

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.710 
lots of armor plenty movement for them
and<00:06:34.490> on<00:06:35.490> the<00:06:35.610> ankles<00:06:36.060> but<00:06:36.180> a<00:06:36.240> little<00:06:36.510> bit

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:36.720 
and on the ankles but a little bit

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.899 
and on the ankles but a little bit
limited<00:06:37.199> to<00:06:37.289> you<00:06:37.409> but<00:06:37.560> you<00:06:37.680> can<00:06:38.010> move<00:06:38.789> that

00:06:38.899 --> 00:06:38.909 
limited to you but you can move that

00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:41.480 
limited to you but you can move that
around<00:06:38.970> just<00:06:39.270> as<00:06:39.690> a<00:06:39.720> it's<00:06:40.440> kind<00:06:40.979> of<00:06:41.070> limited<00:06:41.460> by

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:41.490 
around just as a it's kind of limited by

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:44.149 
around just as a it's kind of limited by
the<00:06:42.229> piece<00:06:43.229> that's<00:06:43.500> just<00:06:43.560> covering<00:06:44.010> that

00:06:44.149 --> 00:06:44.159 
the piece that's just covering that

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:45.740 
the piece that's just covering that
ankle<00:06:44.580> there<00:06:44.729> but<00:06:44.940> you'll<00:06:45.120> just<00:06:45.150> see<00:06:45.599> that

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:45.750 
ankle there but you'll just see that

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:46.820 
ankle there but you'll just see that
I've<00:06:45.900> been<00:06:46.260> better

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:46.830 
I've been better

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:49.560 
I've been better
just<00:06:47.830> let<00:06:48.070> me<00:06:48.160> make<00:06:48.340> the<00:06:48.460> hinge<00:06:48.670> under<00:06:49.180> your<00:06:49.390> so

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:49.570 
just let me make the hinge under your so

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:52.110 
just let me make the hinge under your so
the<00:06:50.170> game<00:06:50.380> that<00:06:50.710> is<00:06:50.860> pointing<00:06:51.460> moving<00:06:51.730> on<00:06:51.850> that

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:52.120 
the game that is pointing moving on that

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.120 
the game that is pointing moving on that
so<00:06:52.240> four<00:06:52.840> six<00:06:53.050> inch<00:06:53.200> finger<00:06:53.530> absolutely

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:54.130 
so four six inch finger absolutely

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:55.410 
so four six inch finger absolutely
articulate<00:06:54.610> there's<00:06:54.880> nothing<00:06:55.210> really

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:55.420 
articulate there's nothing really

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:57.330 
articulate there's nothing really
missing<00:06:55.930> on<00:06:56.140> night<00:06:56.380> and<00:06:56.590> that<00:06:56.740> terms<00:06:57.010> a<00:06:57.100> front

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:57.340 
missing on night and that terms a front

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.880 
missing on night and that terms a front
but<00:06:58.060> it's<00:06:58.660> just<00:06:58.900> a<00:06:58.990> designer's<00:06:59.440> factor<00:06:59.800> you

00:06:59.880 --> 00:06:59.890 
but it's just a designer's factor you

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:02.000 
but it's just a designer's factor you
really<00:07:00.490> want<00:07:00.670> to<00:07:00.760> get<00:07:00.850> this<00:07:01.030> one<00:07:01.270> so

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:02.010 
really want to get this one so

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:04.560 
really want to get this one so
definitely<00:07:03.010> pick<00:07:03.220> up<00:07:03.460> my<00:07:03.640> own<00:07:03.820> page<00:07:04.090> it's<00:07:04.420> so
