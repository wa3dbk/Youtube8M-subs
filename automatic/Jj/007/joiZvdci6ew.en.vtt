show called this week in YouTube and on
Monday<00:00:31.050> I<00:00:31.080> just<00:00:31.410> did<00:00:31.529> was<00:00:31.679> I<00:00:31.769> know<00:00:31.830> we<00:00:32.070> talked

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
Monday I just did was I know we talked

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.770 
Monday I just did was I know we talked
about<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.669> YouTube<00:00:33.090> comments<00:00:33.360> cuz<00:00:33.630> you<00:00:33.690> know

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
about the YouTube comments cuz you know

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.229 
about the YouTube comments cuz you know
everybody<00:00:34.260> is<00:00:34.530> going<00:00:35.309> crazy<00:00:35.370> about<00:00:35.790> nothing

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
everybody is going crazy about nothing

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.790 
everybody is going crazy about nothing
I<00:00:36.270> think<00:00:36.630> most<00:00:36.809> people<00:00:36.899> kind<00:00:37.200> of<00:00:37.350> settle<00:00:37.620> down

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
I think most people kind of settle down

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.530 
I think most people kind of settle down
now<00:00:38.040> so<00:00:38.250> if<00:00:38.399> you<00:00:38.550> even<00:00:38.730> wanted<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.000> know<00:00:39.210> what<00:00:39.360> I

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
now so if you even wanted to know what I

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.000 
now so if you even wanted to know what I
personally<00:00:40.200> think<00:00:40.290> about<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.620> YouTube
