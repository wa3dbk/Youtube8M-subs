before<00:00:00.630> we<00:00:00.719> start<00:00:01.020> building<00:00:01.199> our<00:00:01.909> classes<00:00:02.909> or

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
before we start building our classes or

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:04.700 
before we start building our classes or
the<00:00:03.360> main<00:00:03.510> classes<00:00:04.049> that<00:00:04.230> we're<00:00:04.350> going<00:00:04.440> to<00:00:04.529> use

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
the main classes that we're going to use

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.619 
the main classes that we're going to use
in<00:00:04.859> our<00:00:04.920> application<00:00:05.270> it's<00:00:06.270> worth<00:00:06.480> knowing

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
in our application it's worth knowing

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.270 
in our application it's worth knowing
that<00:00:06.839> we<00:00:06.930> should<00:00:07.109> set<00:00:07.560> up<00:00:07.710> an<00:00:07.830> initialization

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
that we should set up an initialization

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.000 
that we should set up an initialization
file<00:00:08.910> that<00:00:09.090> we<00:00:09.150> include<00:00:09.480> on<00:00:09.660> each<00:00:09.870> page<00:00:10.200> what

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
file that we include on each page what

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.110 
file that we include on each page what
this<00:00:11.130> is<00:00:11.250> going<00:00:11.429> to<00:00:11.490> do<00:00:11.580> is<00:00:11.700> it's<00:00:11.880> going<00:00:12.059> to

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
this is going to do is it's going to

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.530 
this is going to do is it's going to
define<00:00:12.540> things<00:00:12.990> like<00:00:13.519> well<00:00:14.519> start<00:00:15.030> sessions

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
define things like well start sessions

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.890 
define things like well start sessions
so<00:00:15.870> people<00:00:16.440> can<00:00:16.560> log<00:00:16.710> in<00:00:17.029> set<00:00:18.029> config<00:00:18.449> file<00:00:18.690> so

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
so people can log in set config file so

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.720 
so people can log in set config file so
we're<00:00:18.990> going<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:19.140> include<00:00:19.380> our<00:00:19.619> config<00:00:20.160> in

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
we're going to include our config in

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.330 
we're going to include our config in
this<00:00:20.970> file<00:00:21.270> and<00:00:21.539> autoload<00:00:22.350> classes<00:00:23.160> which

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
this file and autoload classes which

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.099 
this file and autoload classes which
we'll<00:00:23.609> touch<00:00:24.029> on<00:00:24.269> and<00:00:24.510> then<00:00:24.660> we'll<00:00:24.900> explain

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
we'll touch on and then we'll explain

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.400 
we'll touch on and then we'll explain
what<00:00:25.859> this<00:00:26.010> actually<00:00:26.220> does<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:26.820> why<00:00:27.000> we<00:00:27.210> do<00:00:27.330> it

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:27.410 
what this actually does and why we do it

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.599 
what this actually does and why we do it
and<00:00:28.410> also<00:00:28.619> include<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.099> functions<00:00:29.519> that

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
and also include the functions that

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:30.980 
and also include the functions that
we're<00:00:29.820> going<00:00:29.939> to<00:00:30.000> use<00:00:30.179> so<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.510> sanitize

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
we're going to use so the sanitize

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.900 
we're going to use so the sanitize
function<00:00:31.439> here<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:31.859> any<00:00:32.309> other<00:00:32.460> functions

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
function here and any other functions

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.340 
function here and any other functions
that<00:00:33.059> you<00:00:33.210> decide<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.719> include<00:00:33.960> in<00:00:34.290> your

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
that you decide to include in your

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.610 
that you decide to include in your
application<00:00:35.989> so<00:00:36.989> let's<00:00:37.170> go<00:00:37.260> ahead<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:37.440> get

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
application so let's go ahead and get

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.170 
application so let's go ahead and get
started<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:38.250> first<00:00:38.280> thing<00:00:38.670> that<00:00:38.820> we<00:00:38.910> want<00:00:39.120> to

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
started the first thing that we want to

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.139 
started the first thing that we want to
do<00:00:39.390> is<00:00:39.690> obviously<00:00:39.840> call<00:00:40.770> session<00:00:41.190> start<00:00:41.520> just

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
do is obviously call session start just

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.900 
do is obviously call session start just
so<00:00:42.270> we<00:00:42.620> basically<00:00:43.620> allow<00:00:44.070> people<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.430> log<00:00:44.730> in

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
so we basically allow people to log in

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.610 
so we basically allow people to log in
without<00:00:45.180> this<00:00:45.570> we<00:00:45.780> wouldn't<00:00:46.020> be<00:00:46.140> able<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.379> set

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
without this we wouldn't be able to set

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.819 
without this we wouldn't be able to set
any<00:00:46.770> sessions<00:00:47.219> at<00:00:47.370> all<00:00:47.899> so<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.350> next<00:00:49.559> thing

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
any sessions at all so the next thing

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.639 
any sessions at all so the next thing
then<00:00:50.219> is<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.879> create<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.270> config<00:00:51.809> now<00:00:52.379> this<00:00:52.530> is

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
then is to create a config now this is

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.250 
then is to create a config now this is
going<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.860> be<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.129> global<00:00:53.789> variable<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:54.989> it's

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
going to be a global variable and it's

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.619 
going to be a global variable and it's
going<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.440> be<00:00:55.530> an<00:00:55.710> array<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.340> different<00:00:56.910> config

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
going to be an array of different config

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.580 
going to be an array of different config
settings<00:00:58.410> so<00:00:59.250> for<00:00:59.460> example<00:01:00.109> MySQL<00:01:01.109> convicts

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
settings so for example MySQL convicts

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.149 
settings so for example MySQL convicts
our<00:01:01.770> database<00:01:02.219> config<00:01:03.320> different<00:01:04.320> names<00:01:04.769> for

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
our database config different names for

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.800 
our database config different names for
things<00:01:05.280> like<00:01:05.580> cookies<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.060> different<00:01:06.630> names

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
things like cookies and different names

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.539 
things like cookies and different names
for<00:01:07.049> things<00:01:07.140> like<00:01:07.290> sessions<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.430> this

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
for things like sessions and this

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.640 
for things like sessions and this
basically<00:01:08.939> just<00:01:09.210> lets<00:01:09.390> us<00:01:09.540> keep<00:01:09.750> consistency

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
basically just lets us keep consistency

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.620 
basically just lets us keep consistency
so<00:01:10.920> once<00:01:11.130> we've<00:01:11.310> done<00:01:11.460> this<00:01:11.670> we<00:01:11.729> will

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
so once we've done this we will

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.109 
so once we've done this we will
eventually<00:01:12.990> crowd<00:01:13.500> our<00:01:13.619> config<00:01:14.130> class<00:01:14.820> which

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
eventually crowd our config class which

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.350 
eventually crowd our config class which
allow<00:01:15.479> us<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.630> just<00:01:15.900> pull<00:01:16.740> any<00:01:17.430> data<00:01:17.880> we<00:01:18.150> want

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
allow us to just pull any data we want

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.320 
allow us to just pull any data we want
from<00:01:18.570> this<00:01:18.750> config<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.320> make<00:01:19.439> it<00:01:19.590> super<00:01:19.890> easy

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
from this config and make it super easy

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.359 
from this config and make it super easy
to<00:01:21.330> set<00:01:21.509> things<00:01:21.750> up<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:22.229> this<00:01:22.500> again<00:01:22.770> saves<00:01:23.220> a

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
to set things up and this again saves a

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.230 
to set things up and this again saves a
massive<00:01:23.850> amount<00:01:24.060> of<00:01:24.150> time<00:01:24.210> in<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.600> future<00:01:24.979> so

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
massive amount of time in the future so

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.510 
massive amount of time in the future so
Global's<00:01:28.159> config<00:01:29.159> is<00:01:29.700> going<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.210> be<00:01:30.360> an<00:01:31.110> array

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
Global's config is going to be an array

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.740 
Global's config is going to be an array
so<00:01:32.520> what<00:01:32.670> we're<00:01:32.790> going<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:32.970> place<00:01:33.180> inside<00:01:33.630> of

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
so what we're going to place inside of

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.210 
so what we're going to place inside of
this<00:01:33.840> array<00:01:34.020> well<00:01:34.409> what<00:01:34.770> we're<00:01:34.860> going<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.040> do

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
this array well what we're going to do

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.270 
this array well what we're going to do
is<00:01:35.310> we're<00:01:35.430> going<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.579> have<00:01:35.790> this<00:01:35.970> as<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:36.210> sort<00:01:36.600> of

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
is we're going to have this as a sort of

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.859 
is we're going to have this as a sort of
storage<00:01:38.280> area<00:01:38.700> so<00:01:38.939> I'm<00:01:39.000> going<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.210> say<00:01:39.420> I<00:01:39.450> want

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
storage area so I'm going to say I want

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.530 
storage area so I'm going to say I want
a<00:01:40.079> MySQL<00:01:41.750> settings<00:01:44.329> array

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
a MySQL settings array

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.130 
a MySQL settings array
I<00:01:45.570> want<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.909> remember<00:01:47.909> settings<00:01:48.570> array<00:01:48.869> and

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
I want a remember settings array and

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.310 
I want a remember settings array and
this<00:01:49.350> is<00:01:49.500> going<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.860> be<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.869> cookie<00:01:51.869> names<00:01:52.079> and

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
this is going to be the cookie names and

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.080 
the cookery cookie expiry of how long we
want<00:01:55.079> users<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.560> be<00:01:55.770> remembered<00:01:56.250> for<00:01:56.490> if<00:01:56.640> we<00:01:56.790> if

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
want users to be remembered for if we if

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.030 
want users to be remembered for if we if
they<00:01:57.450> check<00:01:57.689> that<00:01:57.899> little<00:01:58.079> box<00:01:58.409> on<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.740> login

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
they check that little box on the login

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.380 
they check that little box on the login
page<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.969> we<00:02:00.119> also<00:02:00.270> have<00:02:00.860> session<00:02:01.860> as<00:02:02.009> well<00:02:02.390> so

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
page and we also have session as well so

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.880 
page and we also have session as well so
this<00:02:03.659> will<00:02:03.780> just<00:02:03.899> be<00:02:04.020> basically<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.500> session

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
this will just be basically the session

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.600 
this will just be basically the session
name<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.119> token<00:02:06.659> and<00:02:06.840> that<00:02:07.320> we<00:02:07.409> use<00:02:07.610> so

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
name and the token and that we use so

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.339 
name and the token and that we use so
inside<00:02:09.450> of<00:02:09.569> here

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 
inside of here

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:13.440 
inside of here
let's<00:02:12.010> go<00:02:12.129> ahead<00:02:12.219> and<00:02:12.340> set<00:02:12.730> up<00:02:12.760> our<00:02:13.120> database

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
let's go ahead and set up our database

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.379 
let's go ahead and set up our database
properties<00:02:14.200> so<00:02:15.040> the<00:02:15.159> host<00:02:15.430> is<00:02:15.819> obviously

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:16.389 
properties so the host is obviously

00:02:16.389 --> 00:02:21.569 
properties so the host is obviously
going<00:02:16.599> to<00:02:16.719> be<00:02:17.760> 127.0.0.1<00:02:18.989> or<00:02:20.310> localhost<00:02:21.310> but

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:21.579 
going to be 127.0.0.1 or localhost but

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:23.729 
going to be 127.0.0.1 or localhost but
with<00:02:21.700> local<00:02:21.939> host<00:02:22.359> and<00:02:22.629> PDO<00:02:23.200> you're<00:02:23.499> actually

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
with local host and PDO you're actually

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:25.920 
with local host and PDO you're actually
going<00:02:23.829> to<00:02:23.920> have<00:02:24.010> to<00:02:24.099> do<00:02:24.219> a<00:02:24.249> DNS<00:02:24.760> table<00:02:25.540> lookup

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
going to have to do a DNS table lookup

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.599 
going to have to do a DNS table lookup
so<00:02:26.379> that's<00:02:26.530> going<00:02:26.680> to<00:02:26.739> significantly

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:27.609 
so that's going to significantly

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:29.789 
so that's going to significantly
increase<00:02:28.359> the<00:02:28.900> amount<00:02:29.079> of<00:02:29.170> time<00:02:29.379> it<00:02:29.500> takes<00:02:29.650> for

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:29.799 
increase the amount of time it takes for

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:31.800 
increase the amount of time it takes for
your<00:02:29.920> page<00:02:30.129> to<00:02:30.310> load<00:02:30.459> so<00:02:30.819> please<00:02:31.389> please

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
your page to load so please please

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.520 
your page to load so please please
please<00:02:31.840> use<00:02:32.379> one<00:02:32.849> 27.1<00:02:33.849> to<00:02:34.750> avoid<00:02:34.989> that<00:02:35.109> lookup

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
please use one 27.1 to avoid that lookup

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.839 
please use one 27.1 to avoid that lookup
so<00:02:36.400> user<00:02:36.760> name<00:02:37.060> is<00:02:37.299> going<00:02:37.659> to<00:02:37.750> be<00:02:38.069> root<00:02:39.069> these

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:39.849 
so user name is going to be root these

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:42.000 
so user name is going to be root these
are<00:02:40.000> just<00:02:40.150> my<00:02:40.389> database<00:02:40.900> settings<00:02:41.319> so<00:02:41.560> yours

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
are just my database settings so yours

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.699 
are just my database settings so yours
will<00:02:42.280> obviously<00:02:42.519> vary<00:02:42.669> and<00:02:43.439> password<00:02:44.439> is

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
will obviously vary and password is

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.009 
will obviously vary and password is
going<00:02:45.010> to<00:02:45.129> be<00:02:45.450> nothing<00:02:46.450> I<00:02:46.750> don't<00:02:46.900> have<00:02:46.989> a

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
database name itself is going to be LR

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.399 
database name itself is going to be LR
as<00:02:55.030> we've<00:02:55.209> looked<00:02:55.480> at<00:02:55.629> in<00:02:55.750> previous<00:02:55.870> parts<00:02:56.379> of

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:36.729 
be a day or 12 hours for example so

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:38.520 
be a day or 12 hours for example so
we've<00:03:36.849> got<00:03:37.000> this<00:03:37.120> data<00:03:37.329> here<00:03:37.720> don't<00:03:37.959> worry<00:03:38.139> too

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
we've got this data here don't worry too

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.110 
we've got this data here don't worry too
much<00:03:38.560> about<00:03:38.739> what<00:03:39.159> this<00:03:39.280> actually<00:03:39.340> means<00:03:39.669> at

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
much about what this actually means at

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.330 
much about what this actually means at
the<00:03:40.180> moment<00:03:40.540> because<00:03:40.919> when<00:03:41.919> we<00:03:42.040> actually<00:03:42.159> come

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
the moment because when we actually come

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.909 
the moment because when we actually come
to<00:03:42.669> creating<00:03:43.239> our<00:03:43.419> out<00:03:43.689> the<00:03:44.139> ability<00:03:44.500> for<00:03:44.530> a

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:44.919 
to creating our out the ability for a

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:47.159 
to creating our out the ability for a
user<00:03:44.949> to<00:03:45.340> be<00:03:45.459> remembered<00:03:45.939> we'll<00:03:46.120> see<00:03:46.389> why<00:03:46.959> all

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:47.169 
user to be remembered we'll see why all

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:51.659 
user to be remembered we'll see why all
this<00:03:47.349> is<00:03:48.040> is<00:03:48.370> significant<00:03:49.120> so<00:03:50.459> the<00:03:51.459> session

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:51.669 
this is is significant so the session

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:57.390 
this is is significant so the session
name<00:03:52.000> here<00:03:52.389> is<00:03:52.689> going<00:03:52.989> to<00:03:53.139> be<00:03:53.969> user<00:03:54.969> and<00:03:56.400> that's

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
name here is going to be user and that's

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.159 
name here is going to be user and that's
what<00:03:57.609> we're<00:03:57.729> going<00:03:57.849> to<00:03:57.879> need<00:03:58.000> to<00:03:58.150> do<00:03:58.329> so<00:03:58.719> we

00:03:59.159 --> 00:03:59.169 
what we're going to need to do so we

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:01.379 
what we're going to need to do so we
have<00:03:59.560> set<00:03:59.919> a<00:03:59.949> little<00:04:00.129> config<00:04:00.669> file<00:04:00.909> there<00:04:01.180> so

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:01.389 
have set a little config file there so

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:04.020 
have set a little config file there so
we<00:04:01.479> can<00:04:01.680> pull<00:04:02.680> from<00:04:03.069> that<00:04:03.099> when<00:04:03.519> we<00:04:03.639> go<00:04:03.790> ahead

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
we can pull from that when we go ahead

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.920 
we can pull from that when we go ahead
and<00:04:04.209> create<00:04:04.449> our<00:04:04.509> config<00:04:05.849> our<00:04:06.849> config<00:04:07.389> class

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
and create our config our config class

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.319 
and create our config our config class
eventually<00:04:08.799> now<00:04:09.459> the<00:04:09.549> next<00:04:09.789> thing<00:04:09.909> to<00:04:09.969> do<00:04:10.209> is

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:10.329 
eventually now the next thing to do is

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:11.580 
eventually now the next thing to do is
because<00:04:10.629> we're<00:04:10.750> going<00:04:10.870> to<00:04:10.930> be<00:04:10.989> working<00:04:11.169> with

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
because we're going to be working with

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.469 
because we're going to be working with
lots<00:04:11.829> of<00:04:11.979> different<00:04:12.039> classes<00:04:12.789> we<00:04:13.180> want<00:04:13.389> to

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:13.479 
lots of different classes we want to

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:16.080 
lots of different classes we want to
auto<00:04:13.689> load<00:04:14.139> these<00:04:14.379> in<00:04:14.620> now<00:04:15.189> also<00:04:15.400> loading<00:04:15.969> is

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
auto load these in now also loading is

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.560 
auto load these in now also loading is
basically<00:04:16.570> a<00:04:17.759> quick<00:04:18.759> and<00:04:18.969> very<00:04:19.209> very

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
basically a quick and very very

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.959 
basically a quick and very very
efficient<00:04:20.109> way<00:04:20.289> of<00:04:20.500> loading<00:04:21.130> in<00:04:21.370> classes<00:04:21.820> as

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:21.969 
efficient way of loading in classes as

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:24.330 
efficient way of loading in classes as
and<00:04:22.330> when<00:04:22.599> they're<00:04:22.840> required<00:04:23.229> rather<00:04:23.979> than

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
and when they're required rather than

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.870 
and when they're required rather than
meant

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
meant

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.910 
meant
creating<00:04:25.780> and<00:04:25.930> maintaining<00:04:26.080> a<00:04:26.530> list<00:04:26.770> of

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:26.920 
creating and maintaining a list of

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.400 
creating and maintaining a list of
requires<00:04:27.310> so<00:04:28.090> traditionally<00:04:28.810> what<00:04:28.990> we'd<00:04:29.200> do

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
requires so traditionally what we'd do

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.620 
requires so traditionally what we'd do
is<00:04:29.560> we'd<00:04:29.590> say<00:04:29.920> require<00:04:30.370> once<00:04:30.730> just<00:04:31.150> to<00:04:31.480> make

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
is we'd say require once just to make

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:32.910 
is we'd say require once just to make
sure<00:04:31.780> that<00:04:31.930> things<00:04:32.110> aren't<00:04:32.290> required<00:04:32.500> twice

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:32.920 
sure that things aren't required twice

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:38.070 
sure that things aren't required twice
would<00:04:33.880> say<00:04:34.090> classes<00:04:35.220> config.php<00:04:36.930> we<00:04:37.930> would

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
would say classes config.php we would

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.040 
would say classes config.php we would
then<00:04:38.200> go<00:04:38.380> and<00:04:38.650> change<00:04:39.190> this<00:04:39.460> to<00:04:39.870> cookie<00:04:40.870> dot

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
then go and change this to cookie dot

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.900 
then go and change this to cookie dot
PHP<00:04:41.620> we<00:04:41.860> change<00:04:42.610> this<00:04:42.880> to<00:04:43.410> DB<00:04:44.410> PHP<00:04:45.220> and<00:04:45.460> you<00:04:45.760> can

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
PHP we change this to DB PHP and you can

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.880 
PHP we change this to DB PHP and you can
see<00:04:46.090> that<00:04:46.360> I'm<00:04:46.510> just<00:04:46.780> basically<00:04:47.110> including

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:47.890 
see that I'm just basically including

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:50.100 
see that I'm just basically including
every<00:04:48.490> class<00:04:48.820> I've<00:04:49.030> created<00:04:49.300> in<00:04:49.570> this<00:04:49.630> classes

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
every class I've created in this classes

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.960 
every class I've created in this classes
folder<00:04:50.470> now<00:04:51.010> this<00:04:51.130> is<00:04:51.250> going<00:04:51.430> to<00:04:51.490> be<00:04:51.550> a<00:04:51.610> massive

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
folder now this is going to be a massive

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.390 
folder now this is going to be a massive
long<00:04:52.120> list<00:04:52.420> it's<00:04:52.750> going<00:04:53.050> to<00:04:53.260> be<00:04:53.860> inefficient

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 
long list it's going to be inefficient

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.910 
long list it's going to be inefficient
because<00:04:54.700> we're<00:04:54.940> including<00:04:55.740> everything<00:04:56.740> that

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:56.920 
because we're including everything that

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.160 
because we're including everything that
we<00:04:57.160> want<00:04:57.400> in<00:04:57.610> this<00:04:57.880> init<00:04:58.210> file<00:04:58.480> which<00:04:58.690> we<00:04:58.870> might

00:04:59.160 --> 00:04:59.170 
we want in this init file which we might

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:03.060 
we want in this init file which we might
not<00:04:59.380> want<00:04:59.560> to<00:04:59.650> do<00:05:00.000> and<00:05:01.350> also<00:05:02.350> it's<00:05:02.680> going<00:05:02.860> to<00:05:02.920> be

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.070 
not want to do and also it's going to be

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:04.950 
not want to do and also it's going to be
extremely<00:05:03.520> difficult<00:05:03.820> to<00:05:04.180> maintain<00:05:04.360> because

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
extremely difficult to maintain because

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.720 
extremely difficult to maintain because
what<00:05:05.380> if<00:05:05.500> we<00:05:05.590> change<00:05:05.830> the<00:05:05.980> name<00:05:06.100> of<00:05:06.160> this<00:05:06.340> DB

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:06.730 
what if we change the name of this DB

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:09.090 
what if we change the name of this DB
class<00:05:07.030> we<00:05:08.020> then<00:05:08.260> have<00:05:08.410> to<00:05:08.440> go<00:05:08.620> and<00:05:08.740> change<00:05:08.890> it

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.100 
class we then have to go and change it

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.310 
class we then have to go and change it
here<00:05:09.310> or<00:05:09.490> what<00:05:09.790> if<00:05:09.910> we<00:05:09.940> change<00:05:10.480> the<00:05:10.690> name<00:05:11.140> of

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 
here or what if we change the name of

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.200 
here or what if we change the name of
the<00:05:11.440> folder<00:05:11.620> for<00:05:12.010> example<00:05:12.130> the<00:05:12.610> location<00:05:13.120> of

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
the folder for example the location of

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.540 
the folder for example the location of
the<00:05:13.270> folder<00:05:13.480> we<00:05:14.020> can<00:05:14.140> have<00:05:14.260> to<00:05:14.350> go<00:05:14.470> back<00:05:14.620> and

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
the folder we can have to go back and

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.570 
the folder we can have to go back and
update<00:05:15.640> this<00:05:16.060> so<00:05:16.800> we'll<00:05:17.800> scrap<00:05:18.100> that<00:05:18.130> and

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
update this so we'll scrap that and

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.850 
update this so we'll scrap that and
instead<00:05:18.970> we'll<00:05:19.210> use<00:05:19.570> a<00:05:19.780> function<00:05:20.530> in<00:05:20.710> PHP

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860 
instead we'll use a function in PHP

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.210 
instead we'll use a function in PHP
called<00:05:21.340> SPL<00:05:21.910> autoload<00:05:22.690> register<00:05:23.440> now<00:05:24.070> what

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:24.220 
called SPL autoload register now what

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.190 
called SPL autoload register now what
this<00:05:24.340> does<00:05:24.400> is<00:05:24.700> it<00:05:24.790> allows<00:05:24.820> you<00:05:25.270> to<00:05:25.330> pass<00:05:25.660> in<00:05:25.990> a

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:26.200 
this does is it allows you to pass in a

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.820 
this does is it allows you to pass in a
function<00:05:26.410> that<00:05:27.160> deals<00:05:27.880> with<00:05:28.320> or<00:05:29.320> that's<00:05:29.500> run

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:29.830 
function that deals with or that's run

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.520 
function that deals with or that's run
every<00:05:30.310> time<00:05:30.520> a<00:05:30.550> class<00:05:30.910> is<00:05:31.180> accessed<00:05:31.780> what<00:05:32.410> we

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:32.530 
every time a class is accessed what we

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.200 
every time a class is accessed what we
then<00:05:32.710> do<00:05:32.950> is<00:05:33.070> from<00:05:33.220> the<00:05:33.340> argument<00:05:33.880> list<00:05:34.000> of

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
then do is from the argument list of

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.270 
then do is from the argument list of
this<00:05:34.360> function<00:05:34.810> take<00:05:35.020> the<00:05:35.140> class<00:05:35.470> name<00:05:35.860> and<00:05:36.190> we

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:36.280 
this function take the class name and we

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.610 
this function take the class name and we
can<00:05:36.430> then<00:05:36.580> require<00:05:37.030> that<00:05:37.330> so<00:05:37.900> we<00:05:38.050> really<00:05:38.440> are

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:38.620 
can then require that so we really are

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.790 
can then require that so we really are
taking<00:05:38.920> you<00:05:39.820> know<00:05:39.940> say<00:05:40.510> ten<00:05:41.050> lines<00:05:41.380> of<00:05:41.590> code

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:41.800 
taking you know say ten lines of code

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.550 
taking you know say ten lines of code
and<00:05:41.980> reducing<00:05:42.460> it<00:05:42.550> to<00:05:42.580> just<00:05:42.880> a<00:05:42.970> couple<00:05:43.210> so<00:05:44.050> I'm

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 
and reducing it to just a couple so I'm

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.110 
and reducing it to just a couple so I'm
going<00:05:44.710> to<00:05:44.770> use<00:05:44.950> an<00:05:45.070> anonymous<00:05:45.490> function<00:05:45.670> here

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
going to use an anonymous function here

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.930 
going to use an anonymous function here
a<00:05:46.620> PHP<00:05:47.620> version<00:05:47.890> depending<00:05:48.550> you<00:05:48.670> might<00:05:48.820> have

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:48.940 
a PHP version depending you might have

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:50.580 
a PHP version depending you might have
to<00:05:49.030> create<00:05:49.210> this<00:05:49.330> function<00:05:49.540> outside<00:05:49.930> of<00:05:50.380> here

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:50.590 
to create this function outside of here

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.440 
to create this function outside of here
but<00:05:51.070> the<00:05:51.160> anonymous<00:05:51.550> function<00:05:51.700> is<00:05:52.060> basically

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:52.450 
but the anonymous function is basically

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:54.090 
but the anonymous function is basically
going<00:05:52.690> to<00:05:52.750> have<00:05:52.930> as<00:05:53.200> I've<00:05:53.620> mentioned<00:05:53.830> already

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:54.100 
going to have as I've mentioned already

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.030 
going to have as I've mentioned already
the<00:05:54.910> parameter<00:05:55.600> class<00:05:55.810> which<00:05:56.350> represents<00:05:56.920> the

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:57.040 
the parameter class which represents the

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.040 
the parameter class which represents the
class<00:05:57.280> we're<00:05:57.550> trying<00:05:57.790> to<00:05:57.880> access<00:05:58.330> so<00:05:58.900> for

00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.050 
class we're trying to access so for

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:00.960 
class we're trying to access so for
example<00:05:59.440> if<00:05:59.560> down<00:05:59.770> here<00:06:00.040> we<00:06:00.160> were<00:06:00.280> to<00:06:00.430> say<00:06:00.610> new

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:00.970 
example if down here we were to say new

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:05.850 
example if down here we were to say new
oh<00:06:01.270> sorry<00:06:02.140> DB<00:06:02.770> equals<00:06:03.430> new<00:06:03.910> DB<00:06:04.630> what<00:06:05.530> this<00:06:05.710> is

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:05.860 
oh sorry DB equals new DB what this is

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:07.350 
oh sorry DB equals new DB what this is
then<00:06:06.010> going<00:06:06.190> to<00:06:06.220> do<00:06:06.370> is<00:06:06.520> call<00:06:06.880> this<00:06:07.090> function

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 
then going to do is call this function

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.810 
then going to do is call this function
because<00:06:08.170> we've<00:06:08.320> applied<00:06:09.010> the<00:06:09.280> auto<00:06:09.580> low

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:09.820 
because we've applied the auto low

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.670 
because we've applied the auto low
register<00:06:10.270> an<00:06:10.420> SPL<00:06:10.900> by<00:06:10.990> the<00:06:11.050> way<00:06:11.170> stands<00:06:11.470> for

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 
register an SPL by the way stands for

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.120 
register an SPL by the way stands for
standard<00:06:12.070> PHP<00:06:12.700> library<00:06:13.150> and<00:06:13.890> it's<00:06:14.890> basically

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:15.130 
standard PHP library and it's basically

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:17.130 
standard PHP library and it's basically
just<00:06:15.220> a<00:06:15.400> library<00:06:15.760> of<00:06:15.820> everything<00:06:16.180> that<00:06:16.330> we<00:06:16.510> get

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:17.140 
just a library of everything that we get

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:19.680 
just a library of everything that we get
included<00:06:17.590> with<00:06:17.680> PHP<00:06:17.980> we<00:06:18.970> run<00:06:19.150> this<00:06:19.300> anonymous

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:19.690 
included with PHP we run this anonymous

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:22.190 
included with PHP we run this anonymous
function<00:06:19.800> no<00:06:20.800> need<00:06:20.950> really<00:06:21.100> to<00:06:21.460> define<00:06:21.790> a<00:06:21.820> name

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:22.200 
function no need really to define a name

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:26.160 
function no need really to define a name
class<00:06:23.200> then<00:06:23.650> is<00:06:23.860> DB<00:06:24.790> and<00:06:25.120> what<00:06:25.510> we<00:06:25.600> can<00:06:25.780> then<00:06:25.930> do

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:26.170 
class then is DB and what we can then do

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:29.970 
class then is DB and what we can then do
is<00:06:26.380> inside<00:06:26.710> of<00:06:26.860> here<00:06:27.160> we<00:06:27.400> can<00:06:27.430> require<00:06:27.970> once<00:06:28.980> so

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:29.980 
is inside of here we can require once so

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:33.180 
is inside of here we can require once so
traditionally<00:06:30.430> we'd<00:06:30.610> do<00:06:30.760> classes<00:06:31.420> /d<00:06:32.380> b<00:06:32.530> PHP

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:33.190 
traditionally we'd do classes /d b PHP

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:36.719 
traditionally we'd do classes /d b PHP
but<00:06:33.729> we<00:06:33.880> replace<00:06:34.300> DB<00:06:35.020> with<00:06:35.650> the<00:06:36.100> name<00:06:36.490> of<00:06:36.640> the

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:36.729 
but we replace DB with the name of the

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:37.770 
but we replace DB with the name of the
class<00:06:37.000> so<00:06:37.479> we

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:37.780 
class so we

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:42.120 
class so we
can<00:06:37.990> catenate<00:06:38.380> on<00:06:39.330> class<00:06:40.410> so<00:06:41.410> now<00:06:41.650> when<00:06:41.889> we<00:06:42.010> do

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:42.130 
can catenate on class so now when we do

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:45.780 
can catenate on class so now when we do
something<00:06:42.460> like<00:06:42.490> DB<00:06:43.000> equals<00:06:43.450> new<00:06:43.780> DB<00:06:44.460> this<00:06:45.460> is

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:45.790 
something like DB equals new DB this is

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:46.500 
something like DB equals new DB this is
called

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:46.510 
called

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:48.720 
called
this<00:06:46.780> function<00:06:47.169> is<00:06:47.260> called<00:06:47.440> this<00:06:48.160> represents

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:48.730 
this function is called this represents

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:51.480 
this function is called this represents
DB<00:06:49.090> and<00:06:49.330> we<00:06:49.480> require<00:06:49.930> in<00:06:50.169> DB<00:06:50.650> so<00:06:51.280> we're<00:06:51.400> not

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:51.490 
DB and we require in DB so we're not

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:54.600 
DB and we require in DB so we're not
requiring<00:06:51.970> every<00:06:52.600> single<00:06:52.960> class<00:06:53.320> in<00:06:53.740> this

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:54.610 
requiring every single class in this

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:58.050 
requiring every single class in this
init<00:06:54.970> dot<00:06:55.120> PHP<00:06:55.630> file<00:06:56.850> unnecessarily<00:06:57.850> we're

00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:58.060 
init dot PHP file unnecessarily we're

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.480 
init dot PHP file unnecessarily we're
only<00:06:58.389> requiring<00:06:58.840> things<00:06:59.320> in<00:06:59.560> as<00:06:59.740> we<00:07:00.070> need<00:07:00.250> them

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:00.490 
only requiring things in as we need them

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:03.870 
only requiring things in as we need them
so<00:07:00.910> very<00:07:01.090> very<00:07:01.330> useful<00:07:01.740> so<00:07:02.740> we<00:07:03.370> also<00:07:03.520> then<00:07:03.790> want

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:03.880 
so very very useful so we also then want

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.010 
so very very useful so we also then want
to<00:07:03.970> go<00:07:04.030> ahead<00:07:04.150> and<00:07:04.360> just<00:07:04.480> include<00:07:04.870> the
