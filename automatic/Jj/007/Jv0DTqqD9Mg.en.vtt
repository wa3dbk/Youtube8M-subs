00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:20.019 
answering for us so let's get right into

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:23.399 
answering for us so let's get right into
it<00:00:20.259> the<00:00:20.919> first<00:00:21.130> question<00:00:21.339> is<00:00:21.669> y<00:00:22.599> hasta<00:00:22.869> to<00:00:23.140> you

00:00:23.399 --> 00:00:23.409 
it the first question is y hasta to you

00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:24.689 
it the first question is y hasta to you
very<00:00:23.619> much<00:00:23.739> focus<00:00:24.070> on<00:00:24.130> the<00:00:24.220> physics<00:00:24.519> in<00:00:24.609> the

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:24.699 
very much focus on the physics in the

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:26.550 
very much focus on the physics in the
game<00:00:24.849> one<00:00:25.419> you<00:00:25.720> tell<00:00:25.900> us<00:00:25.929> about<00:00:26.079> how<00:00:26.499> the

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.560 
game one you tell us about how the

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.460 
game one you tell us about how the
handling<00:00:27.039> isn't<00:00:27.390> handling<00:00:28.390> yeah<00:00:28.599> it's<00:00:29.349> pretty

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:29.470 
handling isn't handling yeah it's pretty

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.589 
handling isn't handling yeah it's pretty
exciting<00:00:29.739> actually<00:00:29.919> um<00:00:30.399> so<00:00:31.179> we<00:00:31.269> have<00:00:31.390> copper

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:31.599 
exciting actually um so we have copper

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:33.690 
exciting actually um so we have copper
soup<00:00:31.839> Arkady<00:00:33.160> which<00:00:33.399> is<00:00:33.489> very

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:33.700 
soup Arkady which is very

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.270 
soup Arkady which is very
simulation<00:00:34.180> in<00:00:34.300> franchise<00:00:34.750> so<00:00:35.559> we're<00:00:35.739> really

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
simulation in franchise so we're really

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.490 
simulation in franchise so we're really
targeting<00:00:36.519> somewhere<00:00:37.120> between<00:00:37.269> those<00:00:37.629> two<00:00:37.840> so

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:38.500 
targeting somewhere between those two so

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.400 
targeting somewhere between those two so
I<00:00:39.129> want<00:00:39.699> people<00:00:39.879> out<00:00:40.210> quite<00:00:40.780> used<00:00:40.989> to<00:00:41.050> racing

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.410 
I want people out quite used to racing

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.139 
I want people out quite used to racing
eggs<00:00:41.590> according<00:00:42.070> to<00:00:42.160> pick<00:00:42.309> up<00:00:42.460> a<00:00:42.489> play<00:00:42.760> have

00:00:43.139 --> 00:00:43.149 
eggs according to pick up a play have

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:44.939 
eggs according to pick up a play have
fun<00:00:43.210> they'll<00:00:44.079> feel<00:00:44.320> like<00:00:44.440> they're<00:00:44.590> doing<00:00:44.920> a

00:00:46.709 --> 00:00:46.719 
good job driving the car I'm going to

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:47.980 
good job driving the car I'm going to
spin<00:00:46.989> out<00:00:47.079> all<00:00:47.289> the<00:00:47.350> time

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:47.990 
spin out all the time

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.650 
spin out all the time
yeah<00:00:48.800> you<00:00:49.040> like<00:00:49.190> me<00:00:49.370> like<00:00:49.550> racing<00:00:49.970> racing<00:00:50.540> game

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
challenge so I want to enjoy the physics

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.030 
challenge so I want to enjoy the physics
put<00:00:55.250> a<00:00:55.280> depth<00:00:55.580> to<00:00:55.700> them<00:00:56.350> cast<00:00:57.350> feel<00:00:57.710> like<00:00:57.920> the

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:58.040 
put a depth to them cast feel like the

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.950 
put a depth to them cast feel like the
real-world<00:00:58.220> counterparts<00:00:58.520> so<00:00:59.150> we<00:00:59.570> do<00:00:59.750> take<00:00:59.900> a

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
real-world counterparts so we do take a

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.360 
real-world counterparts so we do take a
lot<00:01:00.020> of<00:01:00.140> care<00:01:00.380> and<00:01:00.590> love<00:01:00.740> like<00:01:00.950> the<00:01:01.040> details

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
lot of care and love like the details

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.790 
lot of care and love like the details
for<00:01:01.460> cars<00:01:01.760> and<00:01:01.940> maybe<00:01:02.660> sure<00:01:02.870> they<00:01:02.990> feel<00:01:03.200> like<00:01:03.770> a

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
for cars and maybe sure they feel like a

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.160 
for cars and maybe sure they feel like a
faster<00:01:04.670> than<00:01:04.790> my<00:01:04.880> life<00:01:05.030> so<00:01:05.420> something

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
faster than my life so something

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.190 
faster than my life so something
everyone<00:01:06.530> something<00:01:07.280> all<00:01:07.700> the<00:01:07.790> cast<00:01:08.000> cool<00:01:08.660> all

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
everyone something all the cast cool all

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.800 
everyone something all the cast cool all
right<00:01:09.230> second<00:01:09.890> question<00:01:10.220> is<00:01:10.450> what<00:01:11.450> a<00:01:11.480> person

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
right second question is what a person

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.600 
right second question is what a person
finishes<00:01:11.930> of<00:01:12.230> the<00:01:12.320> game<00:01:12.530> how<00:01:13.190> can<00:01:13.340> that<00:01:13.370> person

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
finishes of the game how can that person

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.210 
finishes of the game how can that person
return<00:01:14.180> to<00:01:14.450> a<00:01:14.480> previous<00:01:14.720> part<00:01:15.200> of<00:01:15.470> the<00:01:15.770> run<00:01:15.980> and

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
return to a previous part of the run and

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.210 
return to a previous part of the run and
play<00:01:16.790> through<00:01:16.850> game<00:01:17.500> so<00:01:18.500> we<00:01:18.590> using<00:01:18.830> auto<00:01:18.950> log

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
play through game so we using auto log

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.219 
play through game so we using auto log
run<00:01:20.120> cell<00:01:20.360> so<00:01:20.570> I'm<00:01:20.660> just<00:01:20.750> going<00:01:20.870> to<00:01:20.930> track

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
run cell so I'm just going to track

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:23.980 
run cell so I'm just going to track
stats<00:01:22.100> it's<00:01:22.910> going<00:01:23.090> to<00:01:23.150> track<00:01:23.330> where<00:01:23.660> your

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
stats it's going to track where your

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.510 
stats it's going to track where your
friends<00:01:24.260> are<00:01:24.350> lower<00:01:24.680> the<00:01:24.830> head<00:01:25.250> off<00:01:25.400> behind

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
friends are lower the head off behind

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.700 
friends are lower the head off behind
you<00:01:25.850> so<00:01:26.570> you<00:01:26.869> know<00:01:27.050> if<00:01:27.110> your<00:01:27.260> friends<00:01:27.500> behind

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
you so you know if your friends behind

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.770 
you so you know if your friends behind
you<00:01:27.950> like<00:01:28.790> that<00:01:29.030> that's<00:01:29.180> cool<00:01:29.360> you<00:01:29.690> know

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
you like that that's cool you know

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.240 
you like that that's cool you know
you're<00:01:29.990> beating<00:01:30.290> them<00:01:30.320> if<00:01:30.890> you're<00:01:31.040> kind<00:01:31.220> of

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
you're beating them if you're kind of

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:32.680 
you're beating them if you're kind of
like<00:01:31.520> trading<00:01:31.820> your<00:01:32.000> friend<00:01:32.270> then<00:01:32.450> you<00:01:32.479> might

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.690 
like trading your friend then you might

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.960 
like trading your friend then you might
want<00:01:32.720> to<00:01:32.869> go<00:01:32.960> back<00:01:33.170> and<00:01:33.200> redo<00:01:33.770> stage<00:01:34.670> or<00:01:34.940> a

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
want to go back and redo stage or a

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.370 
want to go back and redo stage or a
series<00:01:35.300> of<00:01:35.390> tracks<00:01:35.600> trying<00:01:35.990> to<00:01:36.050> improve<00:01:36.229> your

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
series of tracks trying to improve your

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.260
