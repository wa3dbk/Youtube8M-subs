00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
here pretty cool I guess it some of the

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.859 
here pretty cool I guess it some of the
darts<00:01:37.979> look<00:01:38.130> like<00:01:38.280> they're<00:01:38.490> flipping<00:01:39.450> off<00:01:39.570> so

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
darts look like they're flipping off so

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.910 
darts look like they're flipping off so
that's<00:01:40.560> one<00:01:40.770> problem<00:01:41.070> about<00:01:41.400> it<00:01:42.829> here's<00:01:43.829> the

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
that's one problem about it here's the

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.510 
that's one problem about it here's the
instructions<00:01:44.490> on<00:01:44.640> how<00:01:44.670> you<00:01:45.270> get<00:01:45.720> it<00:01:45.810> open<00:01:46.520> I'll

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
something like that it's kind of like a

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.170 
something like that it's kind of like a
backup<00:03:10.989> gun<00:03:11.170> except<00:03:11.680> it's<00:03:11.860> actually<00:03:12.190> very<00:03:12.220> it

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
backup gun except it's actually very it

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.660 
backup gun except it's actually very it
goes<00:03:13.390> very<00:03:13.600> far<00:03:14.489> which<00:03:15.489> is<00:03:16.470> kind<00:03:17.470> of<00:03:17.530> good<00:03:18.370> and

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
goes very far which is kind of good and

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.370 
goes very far which is kind of good and
bad<00:03:18.730> because<00:03:19.239> the<00:03:19.690> bad<00:03:19.840> part<00:03:20.080> about<00:03:20.140> it<00:03:20.290> is

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
bad because the bad part about it is

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.910 
bad because the bad part about it is
that<00:03:20.820> usually<00:03:21.820> shotguns<00:03:22.450> don't<00:03:23.380> go<00:03:23.530> that<00:03:23.709> far

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
that usually shotguns don't go that far

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.740 
that usually shotguns don't go that far
but<00:03:24.130> this<00:03:24.310> does<00:03:24.580> but<00:03:24.940> they<00:03:25.360> go<00:03:25.450> towards<00:03:25.690> that

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
but this does but they go towards that

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.860 
but this does but they go towards that
is<00:03:25.930> that<00:03:26.110> it<00:03:26.320> goes<00:03:26.560> for<00:03:26.800> which<00:03:27.070> you<00:03:27.430> can<00:03:27.610> shoot

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
is that it goes for which you can shoot

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:37.470
