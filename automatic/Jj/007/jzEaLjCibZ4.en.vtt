00:01:22.779 --> 00:01:22.789 
to Cape Coral that was such amazing fun

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:25.059 
to Cape Coral that was such amazing fun
but<00:01:23.420> I<00:01:23.659> decided<00:01:24.109> to<00:01:24.319> do<00:01:24.469> a<00:01:24.499> trip<00:01:24.770> every<00:01:25.039> year

00:01:25.059 --> 00:01:25.069 
but I decided to do a trip every year

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:28.679 
but I decided to do a trip every year
the<00:01:25.939> intention<00:01:26.509> is<00:01:27.049> to<00:01:27.229> do<00:01:27.530> a<00:01:27.560> trip<00:01:28.310> every<00:01:28.460> year

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:28.689 
the intention is to do a trip every year

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:31.270 
the intention is to do a trip every year
using<00:01:29.689> a<00:01:29.869> different<00:01:30.259> mode<00:01:30.439> of<00:01:30.590> transport<00:01:31.009> so

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
using a different mode of transport so

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.309 
using a different mode of transport so
the<00:01:31.819> first<00:01:32.060> you<00:01:32.240> were<00:01:32.329> cycling<00:01:32.719> second<00:01:33.109> year

00:01:33.309 --> 00:01:33.319 
the first you were cycling second year

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:35.410 
the first you were cycling second year
was<00:01:33.859> canoeing<00:01:34.310> but<00:01:34.429> the<00:01:34.520> canoeing<00:01:34.789> seems<00:01:35.210> to

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
was canoeing but the canoeing seems to

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.499 
was canoeing but the canoeing seems to
be<00:01:35.619> holding<00:01:36.619> on<00:01:36.710> because<00:01:37.130> it's<00:01:37.280> it<00:01:38.060> takes<00:01:38.090> you

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
be holding on because it's it takes you

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:41.020 
be holding on because it's it takes you
to<00:01:38.600> places<00:01:38.740> you<00:01:39.740> wouldn't<00:01:40.069> otherwise<00:01:40.280> get<00:01:40.819> at

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
to places you wouldn't otherwise get at

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.270 
to places you wouldn't otherwise get at
all<00:01:41.210> so<00:01:41.539> I've<00:01:41.630> had<00:01:41.899> two<00:01:42.499> years<00:01:42.710> of<00:01:42.859> canoeing

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
all so I've had two years of canoeing

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.520 
all so I've had two years of canoeing
there<00:01:43.460> but<00:01:44.240> I<00:01:44.270> would<00:01:44.479> like<00:01:44.689> to<00:01:44.869> do<00:01:45.079> a<00:01:45.109> narrow

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
there but I would like to do a narrow

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.730 
there but I would like to do a narrow
boats<00:01:45.859> down<00:01:46.219> the<00:01:46.670> river<00:01:46.909> Thames<00:01:47.619> so<00:01:48.619> I<00:01:48.679> think

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
boats down the river Thames so I think

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.719 
boats down the river Thames so I think
that<00:01:48.950> would<00:01:49.069> be<00:01:49.100> cool<00:01:51.159> the<00:01:52.159> good<00:01:52.369> thing<00:01:52.639> about

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
that would be cool the good thing about

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:54.940 
that would be cool the good thing about
visiting<00:01:53.389> the<00:01:53.569> same<00:01:53.840> place<00:01:54.289> over<00:01:54.560> and<00:01:54.859> over

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
visiting the same place over and over

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.639 
visiting the same place over and over
again<00:01:55.159> you<00:01:56.149> look<00:01:56.329> at<00:01:56.420> a<00:01:56.509> piece<00:01:56.689> of<00:01:56.719> water<00:01:57.079> do

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649 
again you look at a piece of water do

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:59.230 
again you look at a piece of water do
you<00:01:57.709> know<00:01:57.920> that<00:01:58.100> when<00:01:58.249> the<00:01:58.369> tides<00:01:58.639> right<00:01:58.939> out

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
you know that when the tides right out

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.389 
you know that when the tides right out
there's<00:01:59.630> a<00:01:59.689> big<00:01:59.929> trough<00:02:00.439> in<00:02:00.679> that<00:02:00.829> piece<00:02:01.100> there

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
there's a big trough in that piece there

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:03.459 
there's a big trough in that piece there
rocks<00:02:02.090> very<00:02:02.299> close<00:02:02.689> to<00:02:02.840> the<00:02:02.959> surface<00:02:03.200> in

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:03.469 
rocks very close to the surface in

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:06.120 
rocks very close to the surface in
another<00:02:03.770> piece<00:02:04.069> so<00:02:04.700> are<00:02:05.029> some<00:02:05.329> sort<00:02:05.630> of<00:02:05.689> hidden

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
another piece so are some sort of hidden

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:12.910 
another piece so are some sort of hidden
depths<00:02:07.130> there<00:02:07.399> I<00:02:10.180> usually<00:02:11.500> paint<00:02:12.500> three<00:02:12.830> or

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
depths there I usually paint three or

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.210 
depths there I usually paint three or
four<00:02:13.190> of<00:02:13.370> the<00:02:13.490> same<00:02:13.819> view<00:02:14.240> so<00:02:14.780> that<00:02:14.810> some<00:02:15.319> once

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
four of the same view so that some once

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.830 
four of the same view so that some once
back<00:02:16.459> in<00:02:16.610> the<00:02:16.700> studio<00:02:16.939> can<00:02:17.360> make<00:02:17.510> a<00:02:17.540> choice

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
back in the studio can make a choice

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.140 
back in the studio can make a choice
cause<00:02:18.739> the<00:02:18.920> tides<00:02:19.159> coming<00:02:19.549> in<00:02:19.640> and<00:02:19.790> going<00:02:19.879> out

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
cause the tides coming in and going out

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.570 
cause the tides coming in and going out
and

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
and

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.270 
and
the<00:02:21.360> sun's<00:02:21.630> going<00:02:21.930> around<00:02:22.140> so<00:02:22.470> obviously

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
the sun's going around so obviously

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.210 
the sun's going around so obviously
they're<00:02:23.430> quite<00:02:23.640> sometimes<00:02:24.330> quite<00:02:24.540> different

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
they're quite sometimes quite different

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.680 
they're quite sometimes quite different
because<00:02:26.220> if<00:02:26.370> you<00:02:26.580> know<00:02:26.700> if<00:02:26.760> anybody<00:02:27.120> was<00:02:27.240> to<00:02:27.510> be

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
because if you know if anybody was to be

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.350 
because if you know if anybody was to be
particularly<00:02:28.380> pedantic<00:02:29.190> about<00:02:29.490> the<00:02:29.940> shape<00:02:30.180> of

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
particularly pedantic about the shape of

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.600 
particularly pedantic about the shape of
particular<00:02:30.750> bits<00:02:31.140> of<00:02:31.320> rock<00:02:31.560> or<00:02:31.920> the<00:02:32.160> closeness

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
particular bits of rock or the closeness

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.160 
particular bits of rock or the closeness
to<00:02:32.790> the<00:02:33.060> real<00:02:33.360> landscape<00:02:35.570> he<00:02:36.570> completely<00:02:36.990> lost

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
to the real landscape he completely lost

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.440 
to the real landscape he completely lost
their<00:02:37.440> because<00:02:37.650> as<00:02:37.830> you<00:02:38.430> can<00:02:38.580> see<00:02:38.730> it<00:02:38.940> changes

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
their because as you can see it changes

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.350 
their because as you can see it changes
as<00:02:39.960> the<00:02:40.260> process<00:02:40.740> goes<00:02:41.040> through<00:02:41.150> the<00:02:42.150> real

as the process goes through the real

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.910 
as the process goes through the real
nature<00:02:42.660> of<00:02:42.870> things<00:02:43.020> is<00:02:43.230> not<00:02:43.260> really<00:02:43.770> that

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
nature of things is not really that

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.090 
nature of things is not really that
material<00:02:44.520> is<00:02:44.640> how<00:02:45.180> its<00:02:45.710> regarded<00:02:46.710> and<00:02:46.830> I<00:02:46.920> mean

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
material is how its regarded and I mean

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.060 
material is how its regarded and I mean
a<00:02:47.250> lot<00:02:47.400> of<00:02:47.460> things<00:02:47.640> you<00:02:47.730> take<00:02:47.970> out<00:02:48.740> and<00:02:49.740> you<00:02:49.860> put

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
a lot of things you take out and you put

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.190 
a lot of things you take out and you put
in<00:02:50.190> a<00:02:50.310> lot<00:02:50.430> of<00:02:50.460> stuff<00:02:50.880> that<00:02:51.150> you<00:02:51.360> would<00:02:51.930> prefer

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
in a lot of stuff that you would prefer

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:59.900 
in a lot of stuff that you would prefer
to<00:02:52.380> see

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.260 

the<00:03:00.570> reason<00:03:01.020> I've<00:03:01.140> started<00:03:01.410> using<00:03:01.680> watercolor

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
the reason I've started using watercolor

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.200 
the reason I've started using watercolor
as<00:03:03.270> a<00:03:03.380> starting<00:03:04.380> medium<00:03:04.770> it's<00:03:05.520> because<00:03:05.940> of<00:03:06.060> the

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
as a starting medium it's because of the

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.900 
as a starting medium it's because of the
the<00:03:06.480> trips<00:03:06.750> I've<00:03:06.930> made<00:03:06.960> recently<00:03:07.910> watercolor

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
the trips I've made recently watercolor

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.900 
the trips I've made recently watercolor
is<00:03:09.540> a<00:03:09.570> bit<00:03:09.840> fuzzy<00:03:10.080> for<00:03:10.380> me<00:03:10.530> and<00:03:11.220> I<00:03:11.310> don't<00:03:11.370> use<00:03:11.760> it

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
is a bit fuzzy for me and I don't use it

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.450 
is a bit fuzzy for me and I don't use it
as<00:03:12.030> a<00:03:12.060> traditional<00:03:12.800> water<00:03:13.800> colorist<00:03:14.280> would

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:14.460 
as a traditional water colorist would

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.940 
as a traditional water colorist would
use<00:03:14.640> it<00:03:14.820> I<00:03:15.000> use<00:03:15.720> it<00:03:15.900> because<00:03:15.990> I<00:03:16.200> can<00:03:16.590> fit<00:03:16.830> in

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
use it I use it because I can fit in

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.030 
use it I use it because I can fit in
watercolor<00:03:17.340> pad<00:03:17.550> in<00:03:17.730> a<00:03:17.910> bag<00:03:18.590> or<00:03:19.590> into<00:03:19.950> the

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
watercolor pad in a bag or into the

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.130 
watercolor pad in a bag or into the
canoe<00:03:20.370> and<00:03:20.880> then<00:03:21.000> I<00:03:21.030> can<00:03:21.300> travel<00:03:21.540> around<00:03:21.840> and

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
canoe and then I can travel around and

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.760 
canoe and then I can travel around and
get<00:03:22.320> quite<00:03:22.710> a<00:03:22.740> few<00:03:22.860> sketches<00:03:23.420> thrown<00:03:24.420> in<00:03:24.770> get

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
get quite a few sketches thrown in get

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:35.840 
get quite a few sketches thrown in get
it<00:03:25.890> back<00:03:26.040> to<00:03:26.220> the<00:03:26.310> studio<00:03:34.280> if<00:03:35.280> I<00:03:35.430> go<00:03:35.610> on<00:03:35.640> holiday

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
it back to the studio if I go on holiday

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.520 
it back to the studio if I go on holiday
for<00:03:36.330> instance<00:03:36.630> I've<00:03:36.810> taken<00:03:37.050> usually<00:03:37.290> taste

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
for instance I've taken usually taste

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
know I can't sit next to a pool and do

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.600 
know I can't sit next to a pool and do
nothing<00:03:42.870> so<00:03:43.590> there's<00:03:43.950> other<00:03:44.040> other<00:03:44.280> people

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
nothing so there's other other people

nothing so there's other other people
around<00:03:44.700> me<00:03:45.000> I'll<00:03:45.120> throw<00:03:45.360> I've<00:03:45.690> got<00:03:45.840> masses<00:03:46.230> of

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
around me I'll throw I've got masses of

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.490 
around me I'll throw I've got masses of
sketchbooks<00:03:46.950> of<00:03:47.130> people<00:03:47.520> on<00:03:48.240> beaches<00:03:48.990> and<00:03:49.350> on

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
sketchbooks of people on beaches and on

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.100 
sketchbooks of people on beaches and on
mountains<00:03:50.070> and<00:03:50.370> I've<00:03:51.270> done<00:03:51.480> drawings<00:03:51.900> of<00:03:51.990> my

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
mountains and I've done drawings of my

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.820 
mountains and I've done drawings of my
feet<00:03:52.440> of<00:03:53.270> the<00:03:54.270> Trangia<00:03:54.690> stove<00:03:55.230> and<00:03:55.530> of<00:03:55.620> being

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
feet of the Trangia stove and of being

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:00.710 
feet of the Trangia stove and of being
camping<00:03:57.590> anything<00:03:58.590> really<00:03:59.250> I<00:03:59.550> suppose<00:04:00.450> it's<00:04:00.660> a

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
camping anything really I suppose it's a

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.840 
camping anything really I suppose it's a
failing<00:04:00.990> I<00:04:01.170> really<00:04:01.440> can't<00:04:01.710> relax<00:04:02.160> find<00:04:02.760> it

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
failing I really can't relax find it

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.450 
failing I really can't relax find it
almost<00:04:03.000> impossible<00:04:03.210> to<00:04:03.690> relax

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:04.460 
almost impossible to relax

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:14.160 
almost impossible to relax
unless<00:04:05.460> I'm<00:04:05.970> painting

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.430 

so<00:04:14.800> I've<00:04:15.160> done<00:04:15.340> the<00:04:15.490> drawing<00:04:16.079> put<00:04:17.079> the<00:04:17.170> first

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440
