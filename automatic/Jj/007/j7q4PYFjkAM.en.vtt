 128 bits say up to four players at the same time for good players

 Get feet for a thick fish ashore or into the boat 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.010
 pull 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.250
 we loved it so our game needs explaining 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.590
 as soon as a fish has eaten, it is sentimental to the water-dweller 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.799
 catch up because the fishing line could tear otherwise 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.330

 with high speed 16 which makes you feel good when you are watching 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.490
 what does it cost us to make it the PlayStation 3 and their consoles 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.770
 Competitors now focus on the protest 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.490
 The so-called game consoles currently share the world market 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.570
 However, they give their children a nose ahead with their two models son 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.840
 for the cheapest 10 the Christian Smid graphics and computing power of 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.400
 new Christian are noteworthy but not unknown similarly good 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.770
 Animations are already on the market the winning team Kost is actually 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.639
 the first console of the new generation 

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:22.610
 the console in front 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.920
 a beer has come on his stomach and is the first console with which one 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.790
 actually could go to the internet it is to learn and to 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.639
 Modern costs do not come to the internet now 

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:36.759
 the console is for planners 90 watts provide today quite cheap and the 

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:40.679
 Games that are currently there for this opportunity comes the preliminary round 

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:44.369
 9 percent Konrad hectic for his vision the console is class me 

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:45.370
 can fly 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.789
 Everything in it is supple everything 

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:49.849
 everything around 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:52.980
 the form of her the Chancellor has been able to use for the console though 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.069
 Representatives of Apple are still a two years ago so people crying before 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.890
 Dirk Winkler 4 million customers with tele2 my eyes 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:03.569
 still equivalent 

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:05.659
 suddenly came 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:08.429
 Now hire a Hyundai 

00:03:08.429 --> 00:03:10.309
 Bohemia had to be from chords so 

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:13.309
 the people who have the old PlayStation and the consolidated record on all 

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:17.159
 Cases do not matter what it costs the price does not matter but I think 870 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:20.979
 Matrix still a controller the memory card costs 90 times and the periphery 

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:24.279
 speaks Monien Mouse Keyboard should all come in the blender yet 

00:03:24.279 --> 00:03:28.469
 and fairground Constanze swine flu does not take real meaningful 

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:32.839
 the doctors are the experts agree that currently at least try the 

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:34.889
 not really well laid out yet 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:38.430
 Compared to identical games, it quickly becomes apparent that the difference 

00:03:38.429 --> 00:03:42.989
 in terms of animation and 3d graphics the surcharge of currently just under 500 market 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:44.319
 not justified 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:48.419
 The situation is different with the accessories with DVD and a lot of work ahead of us 

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:50.749
 You have options for the Sony ps2 

00:03:50.749 --> 00:03:51.779
 the nose in front 

00:03:51.779 --> 00:03:55.109
 an argument that Michael and Oliver, however, not really convinced 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:58.999
 he had expected something more 

00:03:58.999 --> 00:04:01.999
 So it was clearly the big sayings 

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:06.319
 has brought it to this day has appeared that's exactly what's okay too 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:08.049
 bring 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:12.010
 Börsianer expect the console promised it's just easy you can 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.589
 she also knows that she only cooks with water 

00:04:14.589 --> 00:04:16.849
 he missed 

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:19.529
 So on the US side, the Chinese side put the 

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:21.609
 Southwest half of Germany here begins 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.210
 since then, respect 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.389
 Michael and Oliver are now far from such actions 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.500
 The new console is good, but to risk your own skin 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.500
 She after a detailed plays is for exaggerated 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.750
 meanwhile faltering 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.520
 because the old PlayStation is probably from the capitalist 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.040
 shows up to be enthusiastic but in between on the PC or on the Vegas 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.979
 also played 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:47.979
 first know the graphic city he is indeed a racer 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:52.819
 Some of the places in crèches were taken up by daycare centers 

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:53.969
 method 

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:57.119
 and as a kind 48 play forward without anything 

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:58.789
 it is difficult to reconcile
