00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 hey people and welcome to 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.520
 this intervention video and today would like 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.060
 through the snapshot 12 42 years 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.060
 imagine 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.290
 so the first innovation is eg that one 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.450
 now at the redstone repeater the signal 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.300
 I can just say 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.830
 and that can either no signal 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.680
 do not care what you do here 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.970
 or no signal can be ended or 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.980
 turned off 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.440
 For this one would have to switch this power 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.540
 press here and then hold it like this 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.530
 That would be that you stop so that's how you know 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.690
 turn it off 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.940
 Do you do that around so you should 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.860
 first go to the other and make sense 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.620
 the whole signal is on it though 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.030
 this bedrock lock is there says and around 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.290
 then turn it off again because you 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.180
 With these you could fail that 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.920
 seasoning signal does not need to turn off 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.680
 you turn the power switch and such 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.780
 everything would go out 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.399
 besides, there is a new crafting 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.920
 a recipe for the bus and two weeks 

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:09.090
 only three iron blocks and otherwise only 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.920
 four more railways 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.600
 I would wish that I was here 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.970
 even railways would need 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.330
 but maybe there is something else left 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:22.070
 depending on the case, the depth gets 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:25.110
 ambush also a certain harm 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.119
 besides, you can now do it easier 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.250
 repair because earlier it was like that 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.689
 you had to have a pickaxe in there 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.790
 you took the same tip here 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.020
 do it clean then fix it like that 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.090
 you just have to use the material 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.810
 use the pickaxe or that 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.759
 tool is old 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.110
 so if I travel now pickaxe 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.210
 I would then have railways 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.820
 reintun and then I could do that here 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.740
 decide to fix again and 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.979
 important to decide already and 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.600
 So cost 1 and that is red 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.159
 displayed because I have this one level 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.880
 I just can not do that 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.549
 give 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.689
 and now I would have a level and thus 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.549
 Can I just stop the pickaxe 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.799
 repair again and the old green 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.049
 displayed and the pickaxe who again 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.820
 repaired then we come now too 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.369
 already to the last innovations 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.470
 Bats do not release pressure plates 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.070
 and they do not destroy those anymore 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.959
 fields 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.850
 yes and then there are so small 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.910
 things as always actually bugfixes and 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.410
 then still the language data became 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.720
 updated but otherwise it is just a stop 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.209
 been a small step because mine 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.160
 team now premiere this brings out 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.590
 Because yes it is not far away 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.110
 until the right 14 update by 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.790
 official update yes and how you got the sf 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.349
 Installed 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.879
 you just have to do that 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:37.849
 So other snapshots of me are watching 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:39.620
 I have shown in most of them 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:41.420
 how to install it but meanwhile 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.400
 it's just there you know is 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.650
 actually already and he goes to the 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.530
 page in the video description mo yan 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.629
 point comes thunder the client and 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.310
 yes then you just have to go through yours 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:54.170
 replace minecraft year and have already 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.659
 her the slapshot installed because herself 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.609
 want to play on the set and yes then 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:59.930

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:03.920
 I hope you liked it I have 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:05.269
