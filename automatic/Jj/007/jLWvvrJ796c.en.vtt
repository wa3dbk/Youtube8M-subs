00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.560
 Welcome young people to a new one 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.080
 video today there is the second episode of 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.950
 how to play league of legends at the beginning 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.990
 you have the opportunity here again 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.540
 Click through it and get that 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.070
 to look at the desired topic and in the 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.360
 today's consequence is to become a technical term 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.430
 go around words in league of legends 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.199
 important are the ones you need to deal with 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.880
 to communicate the team you need around 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.800
 a stinginess and my tutorials and 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.060
 ever league of legends comments 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.640
 to understand and the whole game 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.890
 to comprehend at all, but as 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.170
 First of all, we want you 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.850
 show again the league of legends web 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.989
 and we will be here again 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.940
 clarify things and once again 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.989
 explain 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.430
 Here we can see that the 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.559
 markets three different lanes 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.420
 split once is the top line the 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.020
 middle of the bot learning and once in the 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.390
 jungle 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.789
 Here it is enough for us to know which one 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.289
 Role on which alone represent the 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.879
 because this merck will be in the 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.340
 next sequence follows in the third order 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.390
 analyzed a bit more closely and that 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.780
 then we stop in the third 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.760
 episode 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.770
 and now we look only times the 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.829
 Roll on that would be on the top player 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.989
 the tank or often hangs in the jungle 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.119
 the tank or the often in the 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.790
 middle of the ap carey on the hotline of 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.770
 hd kerry together with the supporter like that 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.810
 what are these roles now exactly 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.450
 The tank is just a few of the very ones 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.189
 a lot of def a lot of magic resistance and a lot 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.570
 he has a bit of a life for it 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.880
 less of that compared to the 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.150
 others who often think is a champion 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.070
 which also has a lot of the magic resistance 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.250
 and had a lot to live less than the 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.979
 volcano but he makes on tank more 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.860
 damage as the tank that is only so 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.630
 rather the mediocre and combined 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.880
 live a lot with a lot of harm 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.979
 and then we would have the careys 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.810
 these are divided into ab and ad 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.729
 carey careys are basically the 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.210
 main of the players on the whole 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.549
 game 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.250
 These usually have little life left 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.560
 defense for it all the more so and so 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.780
 They are the key to every game 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.340
 and they can easily do that again 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.530
 turn the whole page and become the one 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.210
 split the off and ad carey dag 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.250
 Careys down and does physical 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.270
 damage and the arteries in the middle makes 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.280
 magic damage 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.160
 and then last but not least 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.330
 the supporter of this is to be there 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.390
 support team 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.560
 through yours through healing through the going 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.200
 and through stunts 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.319
 these eyes are in principle mostly 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.730
 Items the supporter buys and from what 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.730
 the whole team can benefit 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.430
 now we come to the slower 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.160
 General terms in league of 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:32.610
 legends there would be the one in gaydon 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:35.489
 the commitment of a team that means 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.890
 as much as opening a team that 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.989
 If, for example, once feed with 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.760
 his whole team on one side 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.440
 and the opposing team on the other 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.970
 side is there must now one the 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.580
 open fight and do that mostly 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.170
 The tanks in this case times feed and 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.250
 this money was his freedom 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.810
 for example, by using his multi-use 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.549
 the bag this is a tactic in 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.620
 the one trying to destroy towers 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:00.299
 without the help of basal from the 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.049
 ambush and without that 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:05.940
 opposing champions what notice that 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:07.830
 Jason this is actually relatively simple 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.670
 reading just means one opponent 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.010
 to pursue 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.860
 usually an opponent if he is very angry 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.299
 little life has pray is to pray 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.130
 the enticement of an opponent 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:18.930
 should be called if a whole team for 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.120
 example is in a book and the 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.310
 opponent then wants to set a trap 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.650
 can you if you live a little less 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.480
 have the opponent in this book late 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.180
 and thus presents himself with a trap 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.519
 Mistress eating means the enemy 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.890
 damage with as little effort as possible 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:37.380
 to add and thus his game too 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.870
 disturb that peace that is peace 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.760
 Constant dying of a player 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.769
 the opponents get a lot of kills and 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.519
 thus a lot of money and are at the end 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:47.160
 educated 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:48.900
 killshot 1 killshot is a skill 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.819
 which can be avoided 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.160
 or if you have 1 killshot 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:54.660
 you have to aim for that first 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:58.709
 to hit your opponent's target 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:00.959
 si it stands for crowd control so 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:03.200
 translates mass control and that 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:06.450
 Instance and any 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.400
 movement restrictions that rome 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.920
 is the free wandering around on the map 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.500
 this makes it mostly when there when the 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.900
 lane pushes it then you go rom one man 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.840
 moves freely on the map and helps 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.729
 the other lanes the cold cold 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.370
 means in principle is to hit and run 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:25.110
 You meet the man meets his 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.240
 Opponent's pension piece hits his opponent 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.160
 pensions 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.229
 this ability or no that no 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.819
 ability but these tactics walls 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:33.680
 Most sade careys on 

00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:36.199
 So you reach your goal to a piece 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.430
 reach the target hands a piece and 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:39.349
 That's just the advantage of being one 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.720
 so the opponent does but no himself 

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:43.400
 damage suffers so now we look 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.720
 once again the chat terms to the man 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.759
 needs to go with his keeway too 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.979
 communicate with or with the 

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:50.900
 to communicate with opponents so when in 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:52.819
 a game comes in then you read 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.729
 mostly ghd 

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:57.889
 that's supposed to be good luck effern 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:59.210
 translates a lot of fun and good luck that 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:01.550
 you usually write at the beginning of the 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.110
 courtesy of courtesy when you're in 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:06.620
 Game inside is then usually heard 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:08.979
 such things the good job so abbreviation 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:12.800
 gj that means good work in principle 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:13.659
 something like lvmh means forget it 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.870
 all right 

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:20.870
 and at the end when the game is over 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:23.090
 you write either bg or gg should 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:25.009
 Hot bed game or good game that 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.460
 game bad game goodgame good 

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:27.050
 game 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.610
 depending on already won or 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.259
 Once you have lost yourself, you look for yourself 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:33.110
 and in between you can also again 

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:35.330
 So wp read plate and that means im 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:37.250
 Principle well played that way and now 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:39.590
 again you only understand with his 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:41.120
 team mates uses the one only in 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:44.240
 the normal chat does not stand in the whole 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:46.610
 writes that the means for a bb 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.740
 so go back if thats yours 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:50.360
 team with something wrong or 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:51.949
 somewhere pure rendel and you know that 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.740
 because an opponent is then you write 

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:56.330
 bring and then the player goes too 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:58.909
 back again because he knows that goes 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:02.780
 back then there is once focus 

00:05:58.909 --> 00:06:07.310
 So you saw focus so focus for example 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:09.680
 then your team knows that's what they say 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:12.259
 to be focused in a team 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.150
 so that everyone should station and then 

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:17.120
 the rest 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:18.500
 gangbang means a person in the team 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.690
 targeted to kill 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:23.389
 then there is the word ks again 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:24.919
 Abbreviation for kills style and that is 

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:26.690
 just keep that one writing when 

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:27.740
 someone stole a kill mostly 

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:31.340
 in the blue area 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:33.919
 then there is the word it stands for 

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:37.130
 me and if someone is not on the ley 

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:39.560
 there you write miss and say 

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.860
 short that's not on the ladies and 

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.530
 Mrs 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:45.469
 on the map room wandert and 

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:49.069
 could possibly think bmw is called 

00:06:45.469 --> 00:06:55.129
 am my way on my way to be called 

00:06:49.069 --> 00:06:57.860
 go and'll be right there so 

00:06:55.129 --> 00:06:59.780
 out of mana have no more men so 

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:03.530
 do not attack if possible I can you 

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:05.960
 do not push that push that kill 

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:07.669
 the opposing vassals for their own 

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:10.430
 vasallen to the opposing gate 

00:07:07.669 --> 00:07:12.229
 Press like that and it was too 

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:12.830
 the second episode said play league 

00:07:12.229 --> 00:07:15.229
 of legends 

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:18.169
 I hope I could agree with you 

00:07:15.229 --> 00:07:20.270
 help and you should 

00:07:18.169 --> 00:07:21.949
 really the concepts we now 

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:24.050
 really have memorized 

00:07:21.949 --> 00:07:25.520
 learn because these are absolute basics the 

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:27.529
 Everyone must know the league of legends 

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:29.509
 plays those are really pretty easy and it 

00:07:27.529 --> 00:07:30.979
 There are many more things you can do 

00:07:29.509 --> 00:07:32.810
 So you have to know technical terms and 

00:07:30.979 --> 00:07:33.800
 tactics and so but we will become ourselves 

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:36.650
 watch later 

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:37.879
 but here are the ones that follow 

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:39.469
 In any case you should know that 

00:07:37.879 --> 00:07:40.430
 and absolute basics and they are too 

00:07:39.469 --> 00:07:42.050
 not hard to learn 

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:44.930
 That's easy that comes with time 

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:46.190
 Just look at that and that is 

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:48.440
 not difficult in any case 

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:51.190
 yes in the sense to the next episode 

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:51.190
 and skin in
