00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.220
 how to imagine then the effect that 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.290
 could produce an asteroid of 500 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.980
 kilometers in diameter entering 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.980
 collision with the earth 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:30.290
 this reconstruction has been carried out under 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.290
 the control of experts in geophysics 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.840
 to facilitate the understanding of 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:36.520
 proportions the earth has 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.000
 represented as we know it in 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.000
 the present 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.930
 an asteroid 500 kilometers from 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.550
 diameter is for example larger than 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.850
 any of the islands that make up 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.850
 Japan 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.610
 the point of impact was located at 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.970
 full pacific ocean between japan and 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.970
 Australia 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.170
 the speed of the asteroid is 72 thousand 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.940
 kilometers per hour but as it is huge 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.940
 everything seems to develop in slow motion 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.330
 by the effect of the impact the bark 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.970
 terrestrial of a ten kilometers of 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.890
 thickness is removed from the mantle producing 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.830
 what is known as a tsunami crash 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.560
 a tsunami of the earth's crust 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:46.850
 the fine white film is the 4000 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.850
 meters deep ocean 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.880
 the archipelago of japan is 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.880
 Automatically sprayed 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.260
 gigantic pieces are projected more 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.120
 beyond the atmosphere to several thousand 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.379
 kilometers of the surface before 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.120
 fall back on the earth 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:26.840
 producing the effect of bombs of a 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.840
 great power 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.760
 the lips of the crater form an immense 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.090
 mountain chain of 7000 meters 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.090
 height 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.350
 the crater itself is a gulf of 4000 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:52.450
 kilometers in diameter 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:55.860
 and this is no more than the first 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.860
 instants of the catastrophe 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.879
 this immense incandescent dome that 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.489
 remains on the crater for about 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:06.790
 moments after the impact is the vapor of 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:06.790
 rock 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:13.280
 100,000 million megatons of rock 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.960
 instantly transformed into steam 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.350
 because of the extreme heat generated by 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.350
 collision 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:34.760
 after inflating forming a dome this 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:36.409
 rock vapor mass is flattened and it 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.499
 expands at great speed in all 

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:38.499
 addresses 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.130
 barely three hours after the impact on 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.900
 the ocean an extraordinary blast of 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.610
 rock vapor with 4000 degrees 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.620
 centigrade temperature and 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:04:00.050
 moving at a speed of 300 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.050
 meters per second reaches the himalayas 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.400
 the rock vapor now reaches the 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:25.389
 amazonÃ­a in the antipodes of the place 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.389
 where the impact occurred 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:33.370
 the intensity of the heat produces a 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:35.110
 phenomenon of spontaneous combustion in a 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.640
 blink of an eye the jungle will 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.640
 turns into an ocean in flames 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:55.280
 24 hours after the impact the planet 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:58.900
 whole is covered in a cloud of 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.900
 high temperature rock vapor 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:08.080
 this cloud will cover the globe 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.080
 for about a year 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:25.180
 the ocean origin of life does not escape 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.310
 the catastrophe 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.470
 while the rock vapor ends up 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:32.940
 wrap the earth the marine surface 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.940
 Bubbles everywhere 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.259
 and then it goes into a boil 

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:43.170
 the violence of evaporation makes 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.210
 descend the water level at a rate 

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:47.660
 unimaginable five centimeters by 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.660
 minute 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:03.490
 the water of the sea disappears completely 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:03.490
 only the salt remains 

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:07.249
 but it also evaporates quickly 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:12.550
 the ocean floor is now bare 

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:17.790
 and continues to be subjected to that temperature 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:17.790
 extreme very quickly begins to melt 

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:30.280
 just one month after the impact this 

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:33.990
 is the aspect that the earth would show 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:33.990
 under his rock steam shroud 

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:52.890
 a single collision with an asteroid 

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:56.840
 500 kilometers in diameter and there is no 

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:56.840
 a single drop of water on the entire planet 

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:05.440
 when that event occurred 

00:07:02.789 --> 00:07:07.620
 had to eradicate all life form of 

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:11.490
 the surface of the balloon and yet 

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:11.490
 we are here 

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:25.560
 but after a year the rock vapor 

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:28.430
 it dissipated and the temperature started to 

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.430
 progressively decrease 

00:07:35.169 --> 00:07:39.669
 thousand years later the water evaporated from 

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:41.919
 the oceans finally returned to 

00:07:39.669 --> 00:07:43.840
 condense in the form of rain and fell 

00:07:41.919 --> 00:07:46.979
 over the earth at a rate of three thousand 

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:46.979
 millimeters per year 

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:52.650
 this rainfall just as 

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:54.600
 torrential than those of our zones 

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:57.980
 tropical were the food of the 

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.980
 oceanic vessels 

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:04.250
 at that precise moment far below 

00:08:01.699 --> 00:08:06.259
 ocean floor numerous microorganisms 

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:09.789
 they were still surviving and among them 

00:08:06.259 --> 00:08:09.789
 our first ancestors
