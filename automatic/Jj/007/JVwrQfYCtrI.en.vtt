so<00:00:45.480> some<00:00:45.660> great<00:00:45.870> driving<00:00:46.140> from<00:00:46.440> him<00:00:46.589> there<00:00:46.769> and

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
so some great driving from him there and

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.369 
so some great driving from him there and
hardly<00:00:48.089> surprising<00:00:48.449> that<00:00:48.660> Steve<00:00:48.960> Moore<00:00:49.199> is

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
hardly surprising that Steve Moore is

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.630 
hardly surprising that Steve Moore is
out<00:00:49.559> of<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.769> front<00:00:49.980> at<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.100> moment<00:00:50.460> he<00:00:50.550> of

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
out of the front at the moment he of

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.910 
out of the front at the moment he of
course<00:00:50.820> is<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.300> water<00:00:51.510> ski<00:00:51.780> champion<00:00:52.050> so<00:00:52.769> he

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
course is the water ski champion so he

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.170 
course is the water ski champion so he
knows<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.190> thing<00:00:53.339> I<00:00:53.430> feel<00:00:53.640> about<00:00:53.820> being<00:00:54.030> on

the<00:00:54.300> water<00:00:54.479> you<00:00:55.170> can<00:00:55.290> see<00:00:55.440> there<00:00:55.680> how<00:00:55.710> he

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
the water you can see there how he

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.410 
the water you can see there how he
transferred<00:00:56.519> his<00:00:56.699> weight<00:00:56.909> indeed<00:00:57.239> how

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
transferred his weight indeed how

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.119 
transferred his weight indeed how
they're<00:00:57.629> all<00:00:57.780> doing<00:00:57.809> it<00:00:58.170> now<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.409> change

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.460 
they're all doing it now to change
direction<00:00:59.610> and<00:01:00.149> he's<00:01:00.329> very<00:01:00.570> tricky<00:01:00.930> little

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:01.470
