from<00:01:08.850> NYX<00:01:09.240> in<00:01:09.510> milk<00:01:09.960> this<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:10.950> just<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.280> matte

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
from NYX in milk this is just a matte

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.420 
from NYX in milk this is just a matte
white<00:01:12.150> base<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:13.020> I<00:01:13.140> said<00:01:13.439> in<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.680> other<00:01:14.040> video

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
white base and I said in the other video

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.039 
white base and I said in the other video
the<00:01:14.610> reason<00:01:14.939> that<00:01:14.970> I<00:01:15.150> do<00:01:15.210> this<00:01:15.540> is<00:01:15.750> when<00:01:15.900> you're

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
the reason that I do this is when you're

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.440 
the reason that I do this is when you're
working<00:01:16.170> with<00:01:16.500> light<00:01:16.740> colors<00:01:17.159> it<00:01:17.939> really

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
working with light colors it really

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.640 
working with light colors it really
helps<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.170> bring<00:01:20.009> them<00:01:20.250> out<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.960> make<00:01:21.960> them

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
helps to bring them out and make them

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.980 
helps to bring them out and make them
appear<00:01:23.159> more<00:01:23.729> pigmented<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.600> since<00:01:24.810> we're

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
appear more pigmented and since we're

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.249 
appear more pigmented and since we're
working<00:01:25.320> with<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.650> coral<00:01:26.189> color<00:01:26.600> I<00:01:27.600> really<00:01:28.049> want

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
working with a coral color I really want

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.260 
working with a coral color I really want
