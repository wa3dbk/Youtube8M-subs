 match for the nineteenth day of the third division of the 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.820
 group seventh encounter very bad especially in the first part highlighted the 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.950
 defensive solvency the pretty door of the individualities showed press the 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.850
 local team reached the first leg after their respective day of rest 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.519
 the spokesman of the pair pedrosa after being thrashed at home by alcalá and accumulating 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:28.519
 an income of the meetings without knowing the victory 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:35.280
 the first part went unnoticed by all attendees of municipal soto 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.150
 neither of the two teams controlled the game at any time and apparently 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.990
 they wanted and only one kilogram of the protagonist's stopped ball 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.990
 Sunday morning dream to the spectators 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.400
 here we can see the corner launch is that about to enter 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.780
 for the entire squad 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.660
 I think he scored with a big stretch gets clear and finally catch 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.660
 the ball 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.050
 there would not be much more to see in this first part and you would arrive at rest 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:08.600
 with a little flashy game of the móstoles that seemed to come out to the relaxed 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.320
 the door with some changes in his usual eleven 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.900
 tried to reserve the result for in the second half try to surprise 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.440
 the second part was something more animated 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.540
 the bridge is going to add two good chances to get ahead in the 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:23.460
 marker 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.909
 the first one in this one rejects that it falls within the sanse area 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.409
 but that marked very attentive manages to clear the shot of the porteño 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.520
 in the next play a recovery magerit or propitiates an occasion inside 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.149
 of the guide the arousano gets funding and his shots stopped 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:43.260
 no problems by frame 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.300
 in Móstoles tried to relate to set pieces 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.470
 first lush with a great center but the Buenos Aires defense clears at the end 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.450
 then again healthy in a great shot from the front that passes 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.450
 grazing by the left corner of goalkeeper Oscar levín he 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.780
 the móstoles little by little it was becoming owner of the party 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.410
 again on set piece this time diddy about to surprise the defense 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.420
 visitor but his shot fails to find a goal 

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:16.189
 Oscar Slim responded to the rush rivals with a strong shot 

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:18.159
 although somewhat centered 

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:21.159
 marco has no problems catching the ball 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:25.659
 later a center for the left lay carlos lópez inside the area 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:28.229
 but his shots plugged by little angel 

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:31.559
 the rejection falls to him to lush that puts a ball to live but its firings 

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:33.390
 -Detained by oscar medina 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.069
 that nobody goes out of play 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.629
 more than ten minutes to the end a center from the right of lush in the 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:42.969
 launching a foul goes through the middle of the defense and the attackers 

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:46.519
 that strip locates gets the leg then the ball inside the 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:49.519
 goal 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:57.029
 It was 1 to 0 

00:02:57.029 --> 00:03:00.659
 and a nice knock on the door that I had seen that I could get a point 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:03.659
 of the game but now the hopes vanished 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:10.430
 with a beautiful door turned over to the rival area of ​​the local team could 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.730
 extend the result a backlash after a fault in favor of visitors by 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.290
 Juan Ortega propred a pass deep that left the player alone 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:19.079
 local 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:20.749
 who dribbled oscar medina 

00:03:20.749 --> 00:03:23.819
 somewhat heeled central ball that was cleared by crossed 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.449
 the clearance fell a great move hierarchies leaving three players but 

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:32.809
 its quite weak state does not bring problems to the visiting goalkeeper 

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:40.629
 in this way the match would end a match that could finish any 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:46.010
 way there were moments of expiration of the two teams but general a match 

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:49.009
 very poor 

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:53.859
 with this result the móstoles is even more leader staying at four points 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:55.729
 of the fifth place 

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:59.129
 the pretty door on the other hand falls to descent positions 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:01.459
 even with only point of salvation 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:04.799
 with this defeat he has accumulated thirteen matches without knowing the victory 

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:10.819
 ray valley b will be the rival of the móstoles in the next day 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:16.049
 instead the getafe b will visit the old caravanchel without 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.499
 doubt a strong rival stop due door
