00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.390
 the interaction directly with people 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.460
 in general the establishment 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.150
 or cultures because in some of them yes 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.970

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:34.660

 given within this 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:40.540

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.540
 our position 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:50.300
