strictly off of his macro which is

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.950 
strictly off of his macro which is
carrying<00:03:14.710> this<00:03:14.890> -<00:03:15.070> Gemini<00:03:15.400> Oh<00:03:15.520> however<00:03:15.880> it<00:03:16.840> is

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:16.960 
carrying this - Gemini Oh however it is

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.000 
carrying this - Gemini Oh however it is
possible<00:03:17.440> that<00:03:17.470> it<00:03:17.800> could<00:03:17.950> happen<00:03:18.100> that<00:03:19.980> is<00:03:20.980> a

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
possible that it could happen that is a

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:45.530 
possible that it could happen that is a
rotor

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.280 

okay<00:03:46.849> this<00:03:47.849> gets<00:03:48.120> destroyed<00:03:48.480> if<00:03:48.750> two<00:03:49.019> worlds

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
okay this gets destroyed if two worlds

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.890 
okay this gets destroyed if two worlds
destroyed<00:03:49.620> and<00:03:50.069> that's<00:03:50.340> unfortunate<00:03:50.900> this

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
destroyed and that's unfortunate this

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.599 
destroyed and that's unfortunate this
comes<00:03:52.140> a<00:03:52.200> to<00:03:52.349> Kingdom<00:03:52.680> outside<00:03:52.799> of<00:03:53.280> the<00:03:53.370> field

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609 
comes a to Kingdom outside of the field

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:56.619 
comes a to Kingdom outside of the field
right<00:03:53.819> so<00:03:54.120> if<00:03:54.840> this<00:03:55.019> gets<00:03:55.140> destroyed<00:03:55.500> then

00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:56.629 
right so if this gets destroyed then

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:01.330 
right so if this gets destroyed then
just<00:03:57.629> doesn't<00:03:57.840> get<00:03:57.900> destroyed<00:03:58.170> right<00:03:58.459> anyway

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
just doesn't get destroyed right anyway

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:06.460 
just doesn't get destroyed right anyway
attack<00:04:04.310> yes

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470
