 figure of Christmas trees 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.670

 craft stores keep in mind 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.250

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.070

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.140

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.140

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.340
 a thin foami tape 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:47.570
 and we will also place another one in this part 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:13.050
 to hang up our boot we're going to 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:16.400
 form an ear by sticking a ribbon 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.400
 foami in this part 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:23.860

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:26.910
 bowtie we made in our 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.910
