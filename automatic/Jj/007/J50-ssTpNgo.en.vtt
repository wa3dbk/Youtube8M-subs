general like I think specialist is
really<00:03:18.930> cool<00:03:19.140> you<00:03:20.010> know<00:03:20.040> that<00:03:20.670> uh<00:03:20.840> that's<00:03:21.840> a

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
really cool you know that uh that's a

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.949 
really cool you know that uh that's a
positive<00:03:22.410> of<00:03:22.860> modern<00:03:23.130> warfare<00:03:23.280> 3<00:03:23.430> but<00:03:24.360> the

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
positive of modern warfare 3 but the

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.180 
positive of modern warfare 3 but the
support<00:03:25.410> now<00:03:26.870> you<00:03:27.870> think<00:03:28.110> support<00:03:28.620> you<00:03:28.890> think

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
support now you think support you think

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.470 
support now you think support you think
like<00:03:29.489> I<00:03:30.320> don't<00:03:31.320> know<00:03:31.500> like<00:03:31.560> a<00:03:31.769> health<00:03:32.070> pack

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480

like<00:03:33.480> for<00:03:33.959> example<00:03:34.049> like<00:03:34.560> ballistic<00:03:35.190> vest<00:03:35.549> i

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
like for example like ballistic vest i

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.449 
like for example like ballistic vest i

think it's called um you know that stuff

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.069 
think it's called um you know that stuff
is<00:03:38.640> okay<00:03:38.790> because<00:03:39.150> that's<00:03:39.360> actual<00:03:39.780> support

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
is okay because that's actual support

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:42.410 
is okay because that's actual support
stuff<00:03:40.440> but<00:03:41.040> you<00:03:41.400> have<00:03:41.610> stealth<00:03:41.970> bombers

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
stuff but you have stealth bombers

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.870 
stuff but you have stealth bombers
juggernauts<00:03:43.079> and<00:03:43.530> shit<00:03:43.769> like<00:03:43.799> that<00:03:43.980> like

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
juggernauts and shit like that like

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.759 
juggernauts and shit like that like
there's<00:03:45.150> just<00:03:45.239> no<00:03:45.630> skill<00:03:46.019> because<00:03:46.260> you<00:03:46.530> can

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
there's just no skill because you can

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:50.990 
there's just no skill because you can
die<00:03:47.010> and<00:03:47.510> still<00:03:48.510> rack<00:03:48.900> up<00:03:49.200> points<00:03:50.000> towards
