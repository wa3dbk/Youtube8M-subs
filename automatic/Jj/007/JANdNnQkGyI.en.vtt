00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:04.020
 we are very well here in this 

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.310
 entretiempo will thank you 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.200
 Alejandro Sabella the technician of the 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.450
 selection that gives us these minutes 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.549
 so that all the Argentine people are 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.719
 all the soccer fan I hear is a 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:14.849
 technical team of Argentina 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.139
 present, this should not be emphasized anymore 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.420
 every time you have the opportunity and the 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.130
 possibility of watching football is moving away 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.480
 know by watching the players of the 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.769
 football of the Argentine republic as 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.359
 you're away thanks and all good the 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.980
 doubt the first question has to do 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.679
 with what happened yesterday with the kun aguero 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.170
 not because the truth is that we 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.970
 we all worry and I do not know if you could 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.710
 talk to him or someone from the body 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:42.280
 coach could talk to him and as I cu 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:44.829
 yes good spoke the doctor spoke the 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.260
 white julián professor have communicated 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:49.300
 with the 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.859
 it was not apparently good in the 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.710
 sense that there was no injury to 

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:55.960
 seriousness but simply a very 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:59.219
 strong that has an edema and you have to 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:02.229
 wait for recovery as it goes 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.909
 absorbing that inflammation that has 

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:07.549
 obviously what 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:10.999
 quiet because at first it seemed 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:13.369
 much more something more important you 

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:14.869
 convinced lisandro lópez and we are 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:18.049
 looking at me for a while now that I am 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:22.060
 following because he has very good game 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:24.670
 good aerial and also ship once more 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:28.630
 and has made another goal has a good 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.890
 technique and good that goal we said put it 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.740
 with the director when he wants total 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.600
 we are talking about is that goal to live 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.100
 be front forward of office because 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.880
 they also have it taken from above and the 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.039
 leader resolves like a forward 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.369
 and resolved very well I had not seen it 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:46.380
 as clearly as now they are shot nor of 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.119
 those free throws that for the 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.750
 coaches are very difficult does not know 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:54.899
 where to put the defense the barcelona 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.149
 when it has as it is missing 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.420
 cabeceadores is usually a team 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.860
 with players of low stature pulls us out 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.689
 quite outside the area I do not know if they have 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.060
 seen river does he does it well he has 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.700
 Real Madrid because when that falls 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.319
 ball and it gets complicated it's hard 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.549
 on the one hand good to the goalkeeper more 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:18.090
 but if you deviate it some are 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:21.599
 a student of alejandro sabella 11 and 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:24.060
 trobbiani vos tenés omen and higuaín a 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:26.880
 di maria and am there is the question is this 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.519
 with that exuberance in attack is a 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.140
 tactical decision or an obligation to assume 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:33.989
 the risks involved in using those 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.530
 resources putting them all together 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:39.040
 it's a bit of both 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:43.550
 all parties are with the same 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:45.980
 distinctive dilemma and see if yes 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.560
 they all play if they do not play di maria 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.840
 obviously he plays and month and then yes 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.400
 we put the other two forwards to one 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.760
 only good, I always say the same 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.560
 but we have been finding much more 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.910
 it does not give the feeling that they are 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.440
 at least in this part against 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.569
 Germany is ignored by the beans and 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.739
 everything else but that precision in 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:06.290
 speed of the second goal 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:07.489
 it's as if they played during all the 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.760
 week and they had a lot of load 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:12.350
 training and good look at the goal that 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:16.630
 with ecuador as I drug the goal of messi 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.630
 also at a lot of speed it changes 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:23.769
 in the last matches of the match with 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:27.280
 that speed but connected with brazil 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:30.670
 in the united states with colombia in 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.769
 Colombia with Swiss Switzerland already when 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.389
 The three of them gathered at some point 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:37.540
 party in the case of Ecuador was 

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:39.060
 entrance are pictures tremendously 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.500
 destabilizing 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.419
 Alejandro estela cheap we appreciate 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.519
 these minutes to talk a little bit about 

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:47.469
 the selection is coming again and 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:49.540
 we are there a new presentation of the 

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:50.769
 eliminatory how much are you already doing 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.689
 a year that you're more or less in the 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:54.519
 Argentina team selection that you 

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:56.550
 pretend is at what point I was on the 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:59.970
 question 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:02.330
 and I think the team has grown 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.220
 a little 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:07.090
 we are already trying to form a good 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.910
 group outside the field 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:12.700
 It is also important because it helps 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:16.329
 reflect things in on some 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:18.699
 posts we have some 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:20.169
 and we lack a bit of variants and 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:22.000
 well we are looking for that we are 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:24.370
 permanently watching matches 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.700
 talking about talking workouts 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:29.160
 with coaches 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:33.630
 you always have to be in some 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:35.730
 details that thank you I'm going to lose a lot 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.710
 very important luck what he said form 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:39.150
 a large group in the face of what comes with 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.310
 the Argentine team we continue to live 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:44.060
 sharing with you all the 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.060
 great soccer of the argentina
