we're<00:00:54.230> therefore<00:00:54.680> looking<00:00:54.980> at<00:00:55.160> ways<00:00:55.340> of

we're therefore looking at ways of

we're therefore looking at ways of
developing<00:00:56.030> our<00:00:56.149> specialism<00:00:56.809> in<00:00:57.020> order<00:00:57.350> to

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
bring revenue into the charity so they

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:02.189 
bring revenue into the charity so they
can<00:00:59.930> train<00:01:00.170> dogs<00:01:00.469> for<00:01:00.710> people<00:01:00.739> more<00:01:01.129> quickly
