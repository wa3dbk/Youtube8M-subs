 I have also especially when you 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.739

 esperanto although it is neither more nor less than 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.810
 when we wait for someone so long that 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:40.030
 It gives you time to learn several languages 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:45.580
 mix it between them 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:45.580

 Mongolian only Mongolian Europe 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:56.139
 of the South as Australia would protect from 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:58.780
 Machu Picchu finally happened that he speculated 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:01.210
