 Hi, I 'm fine and I invite you to 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.520
 subscribe you will learn how to do 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.919
 a beautiful braid for these seen 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.960
 parents or customize it for any 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.410
 occasion I was inspired by a photo if 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.199
 we will send a big hello list 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.270
 with hair in hand let's start dividing the 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.689
 hair in half and so 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.670
 move towards the nape place the forceps the 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.470
 The rest of the hair is separated with a 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.470
 league I return to divide 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:36.090
 which in turn and making their requests 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:39.120
 all around and separating each one 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.400
 with the clamp why do I do this this is 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.989
 just a guide that make it easier for us to have 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.989
 best more symmetrical 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.600
 you can skip these steps but this is 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.530
 something very basic that will lead you to obtain 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.530
 a better result 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:07.070
 at the beginning of the braid I will continue making 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:07.070
 more partitions set the bar 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:13.390
 start by taking the first lock and what 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:16.360
 divided into three crosses the lock one by 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:19.360
 above the second step, lath 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.280
 above the first and the third by 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.240
 below the first 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.240
 we repeat 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.039
 no no 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:39.620
 cross the first over the second 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.430
 continues splitting and increasing hair 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.430
 to the first 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:54.370
 and passes the bar above it 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.370
 the third below the first 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.320
 Y 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:06.200
 as we go forward we are loosening the 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.740
 braid at the end we will make this same 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.740
 both sides 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.379
 i 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:23.070
 we continue match weaving and 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.070
 offering the braid all around 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.120
 trying to take very thick the 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:43.830
 strands so that it is well distributed 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.830
 and not be too open 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:51.090
 If your hair is too long we only do 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.090
 a little flower and ready 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:08.620
 we continue loosening the braid of both 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:11.410
 sides and clear all around places 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:15.750
 spray and with the tail of the comb 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.750
 loose hair I do it like that 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:29.060
 in case the hair is shorter 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:32.090
 as in this case we can lose the 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:35.120
 beginning and end of the braid hiding it 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:39.560
 below and covering the beginning with the 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:45.190
 end of this set with enough 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:47.900
 hairpins at the same height and loosening 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:51.830
 arrange it so that it does not look 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:53.810
 where you start or where you end up waiting for you 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.240

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.910
