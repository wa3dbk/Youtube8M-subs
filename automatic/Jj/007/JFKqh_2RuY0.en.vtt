very important ideas and let's not
forget<00:05:41.050> of<00:05:41.530> course<00:05:41.560> that<00:05:42.040> one<00:05:42.250> never<00:05:42.550> turns

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:42.940 
forget of course that one never turns

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:46.550 
forget of course that one never turns
one's<00:05:43.300> back<00:05:43.750> for<00:05:44.230> very<00:05:44.470> long<00:05:44.740> to<00:05:45.490> the<00:05:45.640> ocean

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 
one's back for very long to the ocean

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.380 
one's back for very long to the ocean
yes<00:05:47.560> so<00:05:47.830> we<00:05:47.980> have<00:05:48.130> to<00:05:48.280> make<00:05:48.490> sure<00:05:48.520> when<00:05:49.210> we're

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:49.390 
yes so we have to make sure when we're

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:52.800 
yes so we have to make sure when we're
excavating<00:05:49.930> our<00:05:50.560> sandcastle<00:05:51.010> and<00:05:51.810> building

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:52.810 
excavating our sandcastle and building

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.070 
excavating our sandcastle and building
the<00:05:52.960> same<00:05:53.230> that<00:05:53.920> we<00:05:54.160> don't<00:05:54.400> turn<00:05:54.820> our<00:05:55.210> backs<00:05:55.630> on

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 
the same that we don't turn our backs on

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:03.300 
the same that we don't turn our backs on
the<00:05:56.560> sea<00:05:57.810> for<00:05:58.810> so<00:05:59.050> doing<00:05:59.460> good<00:06:00.460> and<00:06:01.080> what<00:06:02.310> as

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:03.310 
the sea for so doing good and what as

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:08.240 
the sea for so doing good and what as
you<00:06:03.490> can<00:06:03.640> appreciate<00:06:05.280> if<00:06:06.280> there<00:06:06.730> were<00:06:07.420> to

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:08.250 
you can appreciate if there were to

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:12.330 
you can appreciate if there were to
build<00:06:09.250> a<00:06:09.400> large<00:06:09.670> swell<00:06:10.380> unforeseen<00:06:11.380> it<00:06:12.100> could

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:12.340 
build a large swell unforeseen it could

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.300 
build a large swell unforeseen it could
come<00:06:12.550> crashing<00:06:13.030> down<00:06:13.060> on<00:06:13.510> the<00:06:13.630> ill<00:06:14.020> prepared

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:14.310 
come crashing down on the ill prepared

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:19.280 
come crashing down on the ill prepared
and

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:19.290 

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:22.800 

the<00:06:20.290> child<00:06:20.620> could<00:06:20.860> be<00:06:20.980> swept<00:06:21.250> out<00:06:21.400> to<00:06:21.460> sea<00:06:21.810> you

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:22.810 
the child could be swept out to sea you

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:27.320 
the child could be swept out to sea you
so<00:06:23.250> never<00:06:24.250> turn<00:06:24.580> your<00:06:24.700> back<00:06:24.760> on<00:06:24.940> on<00:06:25.630> the<00:06:25.750> ocean

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:27.330 
so never turn your back on on the ocean

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:31.370 
so never turn your back on on the ocean
