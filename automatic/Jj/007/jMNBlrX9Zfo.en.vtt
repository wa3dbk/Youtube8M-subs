00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
watches the bowler before the ball is

00:04:54.190 --> 00:05:00.480 
watches the bowler before the ball is
released

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.040 

what<00:05:01.490> we<00:05:01.610> found<00:05:01.819> was<00:05:02.120> that<00:05:02.150> batsman<00:05:02.930> is

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
what we found was that batsman is

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:04.480 
what we found was that batsman is
actually<00:05:03.289> very<00:05:03.379> stable<00:05:03.770> in<00:05:04.039> terms<00:05:04.250> of<00:05:04.400> his

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
actually very stable in terms of his

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.999 
actually very stable in terms of his
gaze<00:05:04.699> pattern<00:05:05.150> and<00:05:05.360> tends<00:05:06.349> to<00:05:06.590> fixate

00:05:06.999 --> 00:05:07.009 
gaze pattern and tends to fixate

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:08.499 
gaze pattern and tends to fixate
primarily<00:05:07.639> on<00:05:07.759> the<00:05:07.849> head<00:05:08.000> and<00:05:08.120> shoulders<00:05:08.479> of

00:05:08.499 --> 00:05:08.509 
primarily on the head and shoulders of

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:10.679 
primarily on the head and shoulders of
the<00:05:08.659> bowler<00:05:08.840> for<00:05:09.169> most<00:05:09.860> of<00:05:10.069> the<00:05:10.159> relative<00:05:10.520> aims

00:05:10.679 --> 00:05:10.689 
the bowler for most of the relative aims

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:13.240 
the bowler for most of the relative aims
so<00:05:11.689> this<00:05:12.199> is<00:05:12.349> the<00:05:12.469> kind<00:05:12.590> of<00:05:12.680> midpoint<00:05:13.129> with

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
so this is the kind of midpoint with

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:14.800 
so this is the kind of midpoint with
them<00:05:13.370> the<00:05:13.520> run-up<00:05:13.759> and<00:05:13.909> as<00:05:14.060> you<00:05:14.180> can<00:05:14.360> see<00:05:14.599> the

them the run-up and as you can see the

concerned that the left arm and the left

that<00:07:16.700> starts<00:07:17.060> with<00:07:17.240> the<00:07:17.360> grip<00:07:17.600> with<00:07:18.260> the<00:07:18.290> hands

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:18.770 
that starts with the grip with the hands

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:20.860 
that starts with the grip with the hands
evenly<00:07:19.190> spaced<00:07:19.460> on<00:07:19.640> the<00:07:19.700> handle<00:07:20.150> as<00:07:20.390> such<00:07:20.630> like

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:20.870 
evenly spaced on the handle as such like

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:23.740 
evenly spaced on the handle as such like
that<00:07:21.050> but<00:07:21.290> more<00:07:21.710> importantly<00:07:22.250> the<00:07:22.460> v's<00:07:22.750> the

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:23.750 
that but more importantly the v's the

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:25.060 
that but more importantly the v's the
video<00:07:24.080> made<00:07:24.350> there<00:07:24.560> with<00:07:24.680> my<00:07:24.800> thumb<00:07:25.040> and

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:25.070 
video made there with my thumb and

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:27.250 
video made there with my thumb and
forefinger<00:07:25.729> on<00:07:25.820> both<00:07:26.030> hands<00:07:26.570> should<00:07:26.720> be

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:27.260 
forefinger on both hands should be

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260 
forefinger on both hands should be
pointing<00:07:27.890> more<00:07:28.100> or<00:07:28.190> less<00:07:28.310> down<00:07:28.729> the<00:07:28.970> back<00:07:29.120> of

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:29.270 
pointing more or less down the back of

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:31.030 
pointing more or less down the back of
the<00:07:29.360> bat<00:07:29.540> there<00:07:30.140> okay

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:31.040 
the bat there okay

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.070 
the bat there okay
so<00:07:31.160> that's<00:07:31.340> that's<00:07:31.610> the<00:07:31.820> basic<00:07:32.240> grip<00:07:32.479> from

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:33.080 
so that's that's the basic grip from

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:34.719 
so that's that's the basic grip from
there<00:07:33.320> we'll<00:07:33.500> move<00:07:33.530> on<00:07:33.800> to<00:07:33.830> the<00:07:34.040> basic<00:07:34.430> stance

00:07:34.719 --> 00:07:34.729 
there we'll move on to the basic stance

00:07:34.729 --> 00:07:38.170 
there we'll move on to the basic stance
which<00:07:35.600> is<00:07:35.810> the<00:07:35.960> bat<00:07:36.640> tucks<00:07:37.640> in<00:07:37.850> here<00:07:38.030> behind

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:38.180 
which is the bat tucks in here behind

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:41.409 
which is the bat tucks in here behind
the<00:07:38.510> back<00:07:38.690> foot<00:07:39.070> right<00:07:40.070> feet<00:07:40.610> evenly<00:07:41.060> spaced

00:07:41.409 --> 00:07:41.419 
the back foot right feet evenly spaced

00:07:41.419 --> 00:07:43.990 
the back foot right feet evenly spaced
apart<00:07:41.750> with<00:07:42.020> the<00:07:42.169> knees<00:07:42.380> slightly<00:07:42.710> bent<00:07:43.000> very

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:44.000 
apart with the knees slightly bent very

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.340 
apart with the knees slightly bent very
important<00:07:44.479> have<00:07:44.570> the<00:07:44.600> knees<00:07:44.870> slightly<00:07:45.169> bent

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:45.350 
important have the knees slightly bent

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:47.080 
important have the knees slightly bent
because<00:07:45.710> that<00:07:45.890> means<00:07:46.100> you're<00:07:46.340> more<00:07:46.520> evenly

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:47.090 
because that means you're more evenly

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:49.900 
because that means you're more evenly
balanced<00:07:47.600> okay<00:07:48.590> and<00:07:48.860> from<00:07:49.220> that<00:07:49.370> position<00:07:49.580> I

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:49.910 
balanced okay and from that position I

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:54.340 
balanced okay and from that position I
can<00:07:50.120> move<00:07:50.300> forward<00:07:51.289> easily<00:07:51.620> or<00:07:52.100> back
