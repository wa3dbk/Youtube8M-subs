00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
spent as much as I have on hearthstone

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.520 
spent as much as I have on hearthstone
cards<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:00.690> they<00:01:00.840> really<00:01:01.050> don't<00:01:01.079> need<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.350> make

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
cards and they really don't need to make

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.900 
cards and they really don't need to make
a<00:01:01.559> cosmetic<00:01:02.070> purchase<00:01:02.399> like<00:01:02.550> they're<00:01:02.699> so

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
a cosmetic purchase like they're so

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.479 
a cosmetic purchase like they're so
expensive<00:01:03.180> I<00:01:03.660> think<00:01:04.229> that<00:01:04.470> at<00:01:04.680> about<00:01:04.830> half<00:01:05.220> the

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
expensive I think that at about half the

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.160 
expensive I think that at about half the
price<00:01:05.729> plus<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.510> would<00:01:06.630> sell<00:01:06.840> more<00:01:07.110> of

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
price plus it would sell more of

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.050 
price plus it would sell more of
cosmetic<00:01:07.770> items<00:01:08.010> like<00:01:08.100> this<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.549> make<00:01:08.880> more

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
cosmetic items like this and make more

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.789 
cosmetic items like this and make more
money<00:01:09.240> through<00:01:09.570> volume<00:01:10.020> sold<00:01:10.350> rather<00:01:10.619> than

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
money through volume sold rather than

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.350 
money through volume sold rather than
just<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.280> really<00:01:11.400> high<00:01:11.580> priced<00:01:11.880> at<00:01:12.060> it<00:01:12.150> said
