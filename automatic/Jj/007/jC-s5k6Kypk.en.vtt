techspray<00:00:00.870> are<00:00:00.960> not<00:00:01.170> as<00:00:01.410> used<00:00:01.770> for<00:00:02.070> tying<00:00:02.310> off

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
techspray are not as used for tying off

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.269 
techspray are not as used for tying off
and<00:00:02.879> there's<00:00:03.629> just<00:00:04.290> really<00:00:04.560> an<00:00:04.650> extension<00:00:04.980> of

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
and there's just really an extension of

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:06.889 
and there's just really an extension of
the<00:00:05.370> figure<00:00:05.640> eight<00:00:05.790> and<00:00:06.270> about<00:00:06.600> the<00:00:06.720> same

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
the figure eight and about the same

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.860 
the figure eight and about the same
strength<00:00:07.410> as<00:00:07.740> a<00:00:07.830> figure<00:00:08.250> eight<00:00:08.400> knot<00:00:08.599> we<00:00:09.599> type

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
strength as a figure eight knot we type

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.620 
strength as a figure eight knot we type
between<00:00:10.260> the<00:00:10.679> rivets<00:00:11.040> here<00:00:11.340> so<00:00:12.179> you<00:00:12.240> cut<00:00:12.480> your

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
between the rivets here so you cut your

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.720 
between the rivets here so you cut your
wire<00:00:12.809> so<00:00:13.139> it's<00:00:13.290> going<00:00:13.469> about<00:00:13.650> 300<00:00:14.309> each<00:00:14.429> side

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
wire so it's going about 300 each side

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.370 
wire so it's going about 300 each side
of<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.240> rivets<00:00:15.949> the<00:00:16.949> first<00:00:17.279> bin<00:00:18.170> goes<00:00:19.170> in<00:00:19.289> the

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
of the rivets the first bin goes in the

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.730 
of the rivets the first bin goes in the
work<00:00:19.590> coming<00:00:20.130> along<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.520> chain<00:00:20.789> there<00:00:21.060> and

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:21.740 
work coming along the chain there and

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.500 
work coming along the chain there and
put<00:00:22.740> your<00:00:22.830> thumb<00:00:22.890> between<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.550> rivets<00:00:23.880> start

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
put your thumb between the rivets start

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.290 
put your thumb between the rivets start
pinning<00:00:24.750> it<00:00:24.930> must<00:00:25.350> go<00:00:25.590> over<00:00:26.279> in<00:00:26.460> clockwise<00:00:26.939> for

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
pinning it must go over in clockwise for

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.740 
pinning it must go over in clockwise for
the<00:00:27.390> smooth<00:00:27.660> one<00:00:27.900> and<00:00:28.619> pull<00:00:28.859> it<00:00:28.980> along<00:00:29.539> so<00:00:30.539> it's

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
the smooth one and pull it along so it's

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.270 
the smooth one and pull it along so it's
quite<00:00:30.960> small<00:00:33.350> and<00:00:34.350> now<00:00:34.590> we<00:00:34.649> go<00:00:34.890> back<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:35.100> that

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
quite small and now we go back to that

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.280 
quite small and now we go back to that
rule<00:00:35.460> of<00:00:35.610> thumb<00:00:35.820> workers<00:00:36.180> under<00:00:36.600> over<00:00:36.960> so<00:00:37.140> it's

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
rule of thumb workers under over so it's

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.010 
rule of thumb workers under over so it's
going<00:00:37.530> under<00:00:37.770> then<00:00:38.370> going<00:00:38.610> over<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:39.780> lean

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
going under then going over and lean

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.770 
going under then going over and lean
into<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.500> chain<00:00:40.710> strain<00:00:41.100> or<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.309> bit<00:00:41.570> slide<00:00:42.570> up

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
into the chain strain or a bit slide up

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.979 
into the chain strain or a bit slide up
there<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.829> pull<00:00:44.040> that<00:00:44.190> round<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:44.520> hold<00:00:44.760> it<00:00:44.989> and

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
there to pull that round to hold it and

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.889 
there to pull that round to hold it and
this<00:00:46.170> wise<00:00:46.410> gone<00:00:46.739> under<00:00:47.329> over<00:00:48.329> so<00:00:48.539> now<00:00:48.690> there's

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
this wise gone under over so now there's

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.439 
this wise gone under over so now there's
been<00:00:49.079> under<00:00:52.550> and<00:00:53.550> then<00:00:53.969> it<00:00:54.090> just<00:00:54.210> comes

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
been under and then it just comes

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.209 
been under and then it just comes
straight<00:00:54.570> back<00:00:54.960> up<00:00:57.500> this<00:00:58.500> one<00:00:58.710> round<00:00:58.949> in<00:00:59.129> the

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
straight back up this one round in the

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.939 
straight back up this one round in the
slide<00:00:59.550> that<00:00:59.579> along<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.180> war<00:01:00.410> and<00:01:01.410> now<00:01:01.739> we're

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
slide that along the war and now we're

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:09.580 
slide that along the war and now we're
ready<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.370> take<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.670> chain<00:01:02.879> strainer<00:01:03.239> off

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.500 

chain<00:01:10.590> strainer<00:01:10.920> off<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.790> right<00:01:12.000> hand<00:01:12.270> one

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
chain strainer off the right hand one

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.410 
chain strainer off the right hand one
stays<00:01:13.110> where<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.500> is<00:01:13.939> just<00:01:14.939> one<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.210> left

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
stays where it is just one the left

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.030 
stays where it is just one the left
inside<00:01:16.790> goes<00:01:17.790> underneath<00:01:18.650> put<00:01:19.650> a<00:01:19.680> couple<00:01:19.979> of

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
inside goes underneath put a couple of

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.859 
inside goes underneath put a couple of
cranks<00:01:20.280> in<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:20.759> it's<00:01:20.939> easy<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.479> tie<00:01:21.720> off

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
cranks in and it's easy to tie off

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.870 
cranks in and it's easy to tie off
because<00:01:22.280> they<00:01:23.280> go<00:01:23.460> in<00:01:23.520> different<00:01:23.580> directions

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
because they go in different directions

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.859 
because they go in different directions
so<00:01:24.600> just<00:01:25.700> with<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.790> right<00:01:27.000> hand<00:01:27.270> but<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.689> little

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
so just with the right hand but a little

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.810 
so just with the right hand but a little
bit<00:01:27.960> of<00:01:28.080> pressure<00:01:28.259> downward<00:01:29.220> pressure<00:01:29.610> on

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
bit of pressure downward pressure on

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:37.789 
bit of pressure downward pressure on
there<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.299> let<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.659> slip<00:01:30.869> went<00:01:31.140> off

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.609 

and<00:01:38.799> then<00:01:38.920> swap<00:01:39.580> hands<00:01:39.960> is<00:01:40.960> the<00:01:41.080> right<00:01:41.259> hand<00:01:41.470> to

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
and then swap hands is the right hand to

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:48.760 
and then swap hands is the right hand to
wrap<00:01:41.799> that<00:01:41.950> one<00:01:42.130> off

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.560 

once<00:01:49.340> you're<00:01:49.460> done<00:01:49.549> both<00:01:49.790> them<00:01:50.030> you<00:01:50.299> can<00:01:50.450> do

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
once you're done both them you can do

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:56.710 
once you're done both them you can do
the<00:01:50.690> brakes<00:01:54.880> and<00:01:55.880> you've<00:01:55.970> got<00:01:56.090> a<00:01:56.119> knot<00:01:56.330> with<00:01:56.360> no

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
the brakes and you've got a knot with no

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.670 
the brakes and you've got a knot with no
