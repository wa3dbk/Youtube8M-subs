00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.550 
black um and yeah it's pretty small this
height<00:02:06.990> right<00:02:07.020> now<00:02:08.300> is<00:02:09.300> six<00:02:09.750> and<00:02:09.869> a<00:02:10.080> fork<00:02:10.379> and

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
height right now is six and a fork and

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.290 
height right now is six and a fork and
just<00:02:10.709> haul<00:02:10.920> but<00:02:11.160> when<00:02:11.280> you<00:02:11.340> open<00:02:11.610> it<00:02:11.700> out<00:02:11.879> this

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
just haul but when you open it out this

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.350 
just haul but when you open it out this
short<00:02:12.510> is

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
short is

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.020 
short is
shorter<00:02:13.630> so<00:02:13.810> it's<00:02:13.960> doing<00:02:14.200> a<00:02:14.260> half<00:02:14.470> inches<00:02:14.770> tall

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
shorter so it's doing a half inches tall

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.390 
shorter so it's doing a half inches tall
it's<00:02:16.030> pretty<00:02:16.270> good<00:02:16.450> for<00:02:16.830> videos<00:02:17.830> that<00:02:18.130> don't

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
it's pretty good for videos that don't

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.090 
it's pretty good for videos that don't
need<00:02:18.610> much<00:02:18.880> height<00:02:19.240> required<00:02:19.870> when<00:02:20.800> you<00:02:20.950> do

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
need much height required when you do

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.650 
need much height required when you do
the<00:02:21.250> videos<00:02:21.550> because<00:02:21.970> as<00:02:22.210> you<00:02:22.300> can<00:02:22.360> see<00:02:22.480> it's

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
the videos because as you can see it's

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.360 
the videos because as you can see it's
pretty<00:02:22.780> close<00:02:23.050> to<00:02:23.170> the<00:02:23.230> ground<00:02:23.410> so<00:02:24.190> we're

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
pretty close to the ground so we're

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:25.620 
pretty close to the ground so we're
using<00:02:24.550> this<00:02:24.790> on<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.090> table<00:02:25.390> and<00:02:25.510> you're

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
using this on the table and you're

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.120 
using this on the table and you're
facing<00:02:25.840> it<00:02:26.020> towards<00:02:26.350> you<00:02:26.470> that's<00:02:26.710> totally

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
facing it towards you that's totally

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.280 
facing it towards you that's totally
fine<00:02:27.310> would<00:02:27.970> you<00:02:28.060> want<00:02:28.240> to<00:02:28.360> show<00:02:28.780> your<00:02:28.990> terms

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
fine would you want to show your terms

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.080 
fine would you want to show your terms
on<00:02:29.620> a<00:02:29.650> table<00:02:30.040> you<00:02:30.130> might<00:02:30.190> have<00:02:30.430> to<00:02:30.550> stack<00:02:30.790> it<00:02:30.820> on

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
on a table you might have to stack it on

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.120 
on a table you might have to stack it on
top<00:02:31.150> of<00:02:31.330> some<00:02:31.630> books<00:02:32.730> yeah<00:02:33.730> that's<00:02:34.330> right<00:02:34.510> only

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
top of some books yeah that's right only

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.020 
top of some books yeah that's right only
downside<00:02:36.130> though<00:02:36.310> is<00:02:36.340> that<00:02:36.520> it's<00:02:36.760> really

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
downside though is that it's really

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.390 
downside though is that it's really
small<00:02:37.240> but<00:02:37.840> during<00:02:38.350> your<00:02:38.590> quality<00:02:38.980> and<00:02:39.190> it's

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
small but during your quality and it's

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.020 
small but during your quality and it's
really<00:02:39.490> nice<00:02:39.700> you<00:02:40.330> can<00:02:40.510> also<00:02:40.720> attach<00:02:41.260> it<00:02:41.470> to

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
really nice you can also attach it to

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.590 
really nice you can also attach it to
something<00:02:43.030> else<00:02:43.270> like<00:02:43.630> a<00:02:43.660> tree<00:02:43.959> branch<00:02:45.600> maybe

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
something else like a tree branch maybe

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:52.560 
something else like a tree branch maybe
a<00:02:46.930> bar<00:02:47.440> right<00:02:48.220> here<00:02:50.010> now<00:02:51.060> so<00:02:52.060> right<00:02:52.239> now<00:02:52.270> it's
