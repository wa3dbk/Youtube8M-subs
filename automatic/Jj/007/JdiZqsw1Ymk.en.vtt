00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
that there is a third one maybe even a

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:49.660 
that there is a third one maybe even a
fourth<00:02:48.650> one<00:02:48.830> but<00:02:49.010> I<00:02:49.070> know<00:02:49.130> there's<00:02:49.400> a<00:02:49.490> third

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
fourth one but I know there's a third

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.130 
fourth one but I know there's a third
one<00:02:49.850> for<00:02:49.880> sure<00:02:50.180> and<00:02:50.510> I'm<00:02:50.600> pretty<00:02:50.810> sure<00:02:50.990> it's

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
one for sure and I'm pretty sure it's

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.860 
one for sure and I'm pretty sure it's
for<00:02:51.320> like<00:02:51.470> color<00:02:52.070> protection<00:02:52.700> but<00:02:53.570> I<00:02:53.600> don't

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
for like color protection but I don't

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.300 
for like color protection but I don't
have<00:02:53.960> any<00:02:54.080> color<00:02:54.290> in<00:02:54.440> my<00:02:54.530> hair<00:02:54.560> besides<00:02:55.040> bleach

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
have any color in my hair besides bleach

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.560 
have any color in my hair besides bleach
and<00:02:55.670> that<00:02:55.910> doesn't<00:02:56.150> really<00:02:56.270> need<00:02:56.420> protection

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
and that doesn't really need protection

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.860 
and that doesn't really need protection
because<00:02:57.260> it's<00:02:57.500> bleach<00:02:57.740> and<00:02:58.480> so<00:02:59.480> I<00:02:59.540> didn't<00:02:59.720> try

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
because it's bleach and so I didn't try

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.900 
because it's bleach and so I didn't try
that<00:03:00.080> one<00:03:00.260> but<00:03:00.500> if<00:03:00.650> I<00:03:00.800> had<00:03:01.010> color<00:03:01.250> in<00:03:01.430> my<00:03:01.550> hair<00:03:01.760> I

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
that one but if I had color in my hair I

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.930 
that one but if I had color in my hair I
might<00:03:02.120> try<00:03:02.300> it<00:03:02.740> but<00:03:03.740> out<00:03:04.070> of<00:03:04.130> the<00:03:04.460> two<00:03:04.640> of<00:03:04.790> these

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
might try it but out of the two of these

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.200 
might try it but out of the two of these
if<00:03:05.240> you<00:03:05.270> have<00:03:05.570> damaged<00:03:06.050> hair<00:03:06.980> or<00:03:07.340> if<00:03:08.000> you<00:03:08.180> just
