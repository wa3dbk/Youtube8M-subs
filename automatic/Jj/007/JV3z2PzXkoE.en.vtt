00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
it's cheaper and it's frankly better now

better<00:02:01.680> but<00:02:02.280> um<00:02:02.460> I<00:02:02.700> would<00:02:02.939> highly<00:02:03.240> recommend

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
better but um I would highly recommend

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.690 
better but um I would highly recommend
it<00:02:03.869> definitely<00:02:04.439> so<00:02:05.009> let's<00:02:05.159> go<00:02:05.280> with<00:02:05.399> some<00:02:05.610> of

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
it definitely so let's go with some of

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.190 
it definitely so let's go with some of
the<00:02:05.759> features<00:02:06.119> let's<00:02:06.360> see<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.630> stock<00:02:06.899> board

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
the features let's see the stock board

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.740 
the features let's see the stock board
has<00:02:07.380> three<00:02:07.740> different<00:02:07.920> modes<00:02:08.390> semi-auto

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
has three different modes semi-auto

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.350 
has three different modes semi-auto
3<00:02:10.259> round<00:02:10.470> burst<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:11.009> fully<00:02:11.190> automatic<00:02:11.580> like<00:02:12.270> I

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
3 round burst and fully automatic like I

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.780 
3 round burst and fully automatic like I
said<00:02:12.540> it's<00:02:12.690> capped<00:02:12.900> at<00:02:13.020> 11<00:02:13.319> so<00:02:13.500> for

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
said it's capped at 11 so for

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.899 
said it's capped at 11 so for
I<00:02:13.819> was<00:02:13.969> gonna<00:02:14.090> shoot<00:02:14.299> around<00:02:14.599> 11<00:02:15.019> or<00:02:15.200> so<00:02:15.909> it's

00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:16.909 
I was gonna shoot around 11 or so it's

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:18.819 
I was gonna shoot around 11 or so it's
got<00:02:17.030> a<00:02:17.060> low<00:02:17.360> floors<00:02:17.689> bolts<00:02:18.200> you<00:02:18.409> can<00:02:18.560> stick

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:18.829 
got a low floors bolts you can stick

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:20.110 
got a low floors bolts you can stick
your<00:02:18.859> finger<00:02:18.980> right<00:02:19.250> in<00:02:19.430> the<00:02:19.489> feed<00:02:19.700> neck<00:02:19.909> and

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
your finger right in the feed neck and

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.910 
your finger right in the feed neck and
right<00:02:20.239> in<00:02:20.329> the<00:02:20.420> breech<00:02:20.629> pull<00:02:21.319> the<00:02:21.439> trigger<00:02:21.680> and

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
right in the breech pull the trigger and

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.289 
right in the breech pull the trigger and
your<00:02:22.010> finger<00:02:22.370> will<00:02:22.640> remain<00:02:22.939> intact<00:02:25.030> do<00:02:26.030> that

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:26.299 
your finger will remain intact do that

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:29.530 
your finger will remain intact do that
so<00:02:26.599> it<00:02:26.750> doesn't<00:02:26.780> it<00:02:27.260> does<00:02:27.769> not<00:02:27.799> shop<00:02:28.250> at<00:02:29.000> all<00:02:29.239> I

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
so it doesn't it does not shop at all I

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.089 
so it doesn't it does not shop at all I
mean<00:02:29.840> it<00:02:30.560> might<00:02:31.310> but<00:02:32.269> very<00:02:32.989> very<00:02:33.349> very<00:02:33.739> rarely

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
mean it might but very very very rarely

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:35.470 
mean it might but very very very rarely
it's<00:02:34.609> which<00:02:34.879> is<00:02:35.000> great

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
it's which is great

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.039 
it's which is great
well<00:02:35.900> force<00:02:36.140> bolts<00:02:36.500> gotta<00:02:36.920> love<00:02:37.129> it<00:02:38.150> it<00:02:38.870> also

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
well force bolts gotta love it it also

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:41.860 
well force bolts gotta love it it also
makes<00:02:39.319> a<00:02:39.409> cool<00:02:39.560> sound<00:02:40.060> when<00:02:41.060> you<00:02:41.120> shoot<00:02:41.359> it<00:02:41.540> so

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
makes a cool sound when you shoot it so

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.629 
makes a cool sound when you shoot it so
that's<00:02:42.170> always<00:02:42.319> cool<00:02:42.560> works<00:02:43.040> with<00:02:43.219> co2<00:02:43.489> or<00:02:43.730> HPA

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:45.639 
that's always cool works with co2 or HPA

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:48.490 
that's always cool works with co2 or HPA
but<00:02:46.639> obviously<00:02:47.090> we<00:02:47.269> recommend<00:02:47.720> HPA<00:02:48.019> is<00:02:48.290> better

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
but obviously we recommend HPA is better

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.440 
but obviously we recommend HPA is better
for<00:02:48.650> your<00:02:48.739> gun<00:02:48.920> cleaner<00:02:49.519> and<00:02:49.879> we're<00:02:50.299> going<00:02:50.420> to

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
for your gun cleaner and we're going to

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.629 
for your gun cleaner and we're going to
the<00:02:50.629> new<00:02:50.780> video<00:02:50.930> for<00:02:51.290> the<00:02:51.319> beginners<00:02:51.769> telling

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:52.639 
the new video for the beginners telling

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:55.000 
the new video for the beginners telling
you<00:02:52.730> why<00:02:52.909> I<00:02:53.209> can<00:02:53.900> just<00:02:54.049> our<00:02:54.169> velocity<00:02:54.620> with<00:02:54.980> the

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
you why I can just our velocity with the

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.229 
you why I can just our velocity with the
Helmke<00:02:55.340> right<00:02:55.730> in<00:02:55.819> the<00:02:55.879> bomb<00:02:56.060> in<00:02:56.180> the

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
Helmke right in the bomb in the

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.899 
Helmke right in the bomb in the
regulator<00:02:57.250> can't<00:02:58.250> remember<00:02:58.459> the<00:02:58.579> name<00:02:58.730> of<00:02:58.849> the

00:02:58.899 --> 00:02:58.909 
regulator can't remember the name of the

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:02.319 
regulator can't remember the name of the
regulator<00:02:59.299> but<00:03:00.760> I've<00:03:01.760> been<00:03:01.909> trying<00:03:02.120> to<00:03:02.209> think

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:02.329 
regulator but I've been trying to think

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:04.360 
regulator but I've been trying to think
about<00:03:02.569> before<00:03:02.780> the<00:03:03.019> video<00:03:03.230> too<00:03:03.319> but<00:03:03.980> it's<00:03:04.129> the

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
about before the video too but it's the

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.849 
about before the video too but it's the
same<00:03:04.549> regular<00:03:04.939> they<00:03:05.120> use<00:03:05.269> on<00:03:05.560> man<00:03:06.560> I<00:03:06.590> can't

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:06.859 
same regular they use on man I can't

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:08.800 
same regular they use on man I can't
think<00:03:07.069> of<00:03:07.099> it<00:03:07.189> by<00:03:07.310> post<00:03:07.519> and<00:03:07.700> then<00:03:08.060> the<00:03:08.090> knob

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
think of it by post and then the knob

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.740 
think of it by post and then the knob
now<00:03:09.169> in<00:03:09.769> the<00:03:09.889> description<00:03:10.400> but<00:03:11.209> I<00:03:11.299> do<00:03:11.359> think<00:03:11.689> of

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
now in the description but I do think of

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.770 
now in the description but I do think of
it<00:03:11.900> try<00:03:12.590> to<00:03:12.650> talk<00:03:12.829> fast<00:03:13.069> that<00:03:13.340> I<00:03:13.370> can't<00:03:13.780> it
