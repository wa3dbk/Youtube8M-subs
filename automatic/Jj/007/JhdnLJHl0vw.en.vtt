00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:35.390 
my shop um but I'm glad I picked it up
anyway<00:05:33.840> I<00:05:33.870> think<00:05:34.020> it's<00:05:34.260> just<00:05:34.440> such<00:05:34.620> a<00:05:34.650> unique

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 
anyway I think it's just such a unique

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.210 
anyway I think it's just such a unique
piece<00:05:35.640> and

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:42.170 

it's<00:05:38.850> cool<00:05:39.800> then<00:05:40.800> I<00:05:40.890> found<00:05:41.070> this<00:05:41.220> and<00:05:41.640> if<00:05:42.060> you

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180 
it's cool then I found this and if you

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.930 
it's cool then I found this and if you
saw<00:05:42.450> from<00:05:42.930> the<00:05:43.050> footage<00:05:43.680> I<00:05:43.980> first<00:05:44.550> I<00:05:44.700> had<00:05:44.820> no

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:44.940 
saw from the footage I first I had no

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:47.210 
saw from the footage I first I had no
idea<00:05:44.970> what<00:05:45.360> it<00:05:45.480> was<00:05:45.630> and<00:05:45.990> I<00:05:46.500> started<00:05:46.920> filming

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:47.220 
idea what it was and I started filming

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:48.940 
idea what it was and I started filming
up<00:05:47.340> I<00:05:47.460> figured<00:05:47.820> out<00:05:47.910> what<00:05:48.060> it<00:05:48.150> was<00:05:48.270> um

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:48.950 
up I figured out what it was um

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:52.580 
up I figured out what it was um
obviously<00:05:49.950> it<00:05:50.400> looks<00:05:50.430> like<00:05:50.820> a<00:05:50.850> typewriter<00:05:51.590> but

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:52.590 
obviously it looks like a typewriter but

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:55.610 
obviously it looks like a typewriter but
it's<00:05:53.370> actually<00:05:53.580> a<00:05:54.090> piggy<00:05:54.720> bank<00:05:54.900> and<00:05:55.170> you<00:05:55.470> can

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.620 
it's actually a piggy bank and you can

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.770 
it's actually a piggy bank and you can
just<00:05:55.830> put<00:05:56.100> your<00:05:56.250> coins<00:05:56.460> in<00:05:56.640> it<00:05:56.730> and<00:05:56.940> I<00:05:57.450> just

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 
just put your coins in it and I just

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.290 
just put your coins in it and I just
thought<00:05:57.900> that<00:05:57.960> was<00:05:58.320> really<00:05:58.620> awesome<00:05:58.860> and<00:05:59.310> i

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 
thought that was really awesome and i

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.480 
thought that was really awesome and i
paid<00:06:00.750> almost<00:06:00.930> five<00:06:01.410> dollars<00:06:01.860> for<00:06:02.070> this<00:06:02.190> it<00:06:02.400> was

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:02.490 
paid almost five dollars for this it was

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.540 
paid almost five dollars for this it was
four<00:06:02.820> dollars<00:06:03.120> and<00:06:03.270> fifty<00:06:03.480> cents<00:06:03.750> plus<00:06:03.930> tax

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:04.550 
four dollars and fifty cents plus tax

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:07.610 
four dollars and fifty cents plus tax
but<00:06:05.550> it'll<00:06:06.300> probably<00:06:06.540> be<00:06:06.870> on<00:06:07.050> my<00:06:07.230> shop<00:06:07.410> as<00:06:07.590> well

rushed out before I got a chance to look
at<00:06:52.980> the<00:06:53.040> jewelry<00:06:53.370> because<00:06:53.610> I<00:06:53.940> really<00:06:54.479> do<00:06:54.570> need

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:54.720 
at the jewelry because I really do need

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:58.340 
at the jewelry because I really do need
to<00:06:54.780> get<00:06:55.020> it<00:06:55.260> get<00:06:55.919> somewhere<00:06:56.280> and<00:06:56.340> um<00:06:57.150> I<00:06:57.750> knew<00:06:58.290> I

00:06:58.340 --> 00:06:58.350 
to get it get somewhere and um I knew I

00:06:58.350 --> 00:06:59.930 
to get it get somewhere and um I knew I
wanted<00:06:58.620> to<00:06:58.740> have<00:06:58.890> time<00:06:59.220> to<00:06:59.340> film<00:06:59.580> this<00:06:59.669> really

00:06:59.930 --> 00:06:59.940 
wanted to have time to film this really

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:01.520 
wanted to have time to film this really
quickly<00:07:00.120> and<00:07:00.450> I<00:07:00.810> think<00:07:01.020> it's<00:07:01.140> already<00:07:01.380> been

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:01.530 
quickly and I think it's already been

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:04.280 
quickly and I think it's already been
quite<00:07:02.070> a<00:07:02.100> time<00:07:02.460> so<00:07:02.910> I<00:07:02.970> should<00:07:03.120> probably<00:07:03.150> go<00:07:03.690> but

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:04.290 
quite a time so I should probably go but

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:07.219 
quite a time so I should probably go but
um<00:07:04.740> I'm<00:07:05.040> so<00:07:05.550> glad<00:07:05.669> that<00:07:05.850> I<00:07:05.880> got<00:07:06.090> another<00:07:06.690> 50<00:07:06.900> for
