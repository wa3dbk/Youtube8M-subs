00:00:30.566 --> 00:00:33.482
 Stop it! I don't want you to shoot me. 

00:00:33.502 --> 00:00:36.383
 Why? You are beautiful. You look like a supermodel. 

00:00:36.403 --> 00:00:38.274
 What? No, I don't look. 

00:00:38.294 --> 00:00:42.087
 Well, you're right. You're too ugly. Like a troll. 

00:00:42.107 --> 00:00:45.236
 - What? Ugly? - Yeah, like an angry troll. 

00:00:46.494 --> 00:00:48.364
 Shut up! Give me the camera. 

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:53.730
 What are you doing? 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.148
 Nothing. 

00:01:10.932 --> 00:01:14.188
 Continuum 1x03 - A Step Back to the Future 

00:01:16.278 --> 00:01:18.536
 I thought I heard someone's laughter. 

00:01:19.315 --> 00:01:24.147
 Oh yes. I read ... something funny. 

00:01:24.588 --> 00:01:27.057
 Great. You found the books. 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:28.871
 Yes. 

00:01:45.423 --> 00:01:48.257
 Real Books I ... 

00:01:49.154 --> 00:01:52.447
 I haven't seen real paper books for a long time. 

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:55.276
 New, I agree. 

00:01:57.287 --> 00:01:59.474
 That's funny. Novelty. 

00:02:00.223 --> 00:02:02.701
 So you don't miss a sense of humor. 

00:02:02.721 --> 00:02:04.624
 I do not understand. 

00:02:07.412 --> 00:02:09.349
 All those books are mine? 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.319
 These are the personal items you took with you. 

00:02:12.643 --> 00:02:14.443
 You thought they might come in handy. 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.850
 Throw what? 

00:02:16.186 --> 00:02:17.538
 You didn't mention that. 

00:03:16.881 --> 00:03:18.081
 You found him. 

00:03:18.482 --> 00:03:20.899
 You said I was the only person aboard. 

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:21.953
 You are. 

00:03:21.973 --> 00:03:23.473
 So who the hell is this? 

00:03:23.493 --> 00:03:25.564
 It is not important. 

00:03:26.033 --> 00:03:27.194
 As? 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:28.951
 Is dead. 

00:03:29.454 --> 00:03:33.859
 That's why I said you were the only living flesh and bone man on board the ship. 

00:03:36.763 --> 00:03:38.212
 So what was he? 

00:03:38.232 --> 00:03:39.382
 Prisoner. 

00:03:41.878 --> 00:03:43.154
 What did he do? 

00:03:43.174 --> 00:03:44.743
 He was a mercenary ... 

00:03:45.765 --> 00:03:47.115
 who was supposed to kill you. 

00:04:00.931 --> 00:04:06.562
