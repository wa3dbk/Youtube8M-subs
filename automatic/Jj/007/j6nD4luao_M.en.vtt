00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:14.040
 hello my name is crazy 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:20.580
 professor arte from lab science they 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:22.590
 and we are more than a bang today 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.689
 I will introduce you to an amazing chemical 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:29.820
 a substance called liquid nitrogen 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:32.610
 this gas whose temperature reaches 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.010
 inconceivable minus 196 degrees Celsius 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.960
 it's just incredibly so low 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.879
 temperature can be found except in 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.780
 space and on earth 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:47.309
 she turns ordinary things to me ordinary 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:49.710
 and for storing liquid nitrogen came up 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.289
 special thermos which is called 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.370
 vessel of theor about him we'll talk in 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.370
 next video and now 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.379
 for demonstrating crazy properties 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.710
 liquid nitrogen we need a rose and 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:12.390
 of course liquid nitrogen itself 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:14.960
 drop pink george nitrogen and look at 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.960
 what is desirable 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.929
 It looks like a rose after liquid nitrogen and 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.929
 that's why she is unusual 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.150
 Here we are such a wonderful experiment 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.230
 Today we will check with you 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.080
 mad professor 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:43.190
 artes from laboratories on hands and not 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.100
 experiment with and because 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.260
 we are more than ear more videos from 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:52.630

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.630
