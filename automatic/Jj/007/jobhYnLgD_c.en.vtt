another<00:01:33.840> thing<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.200> we<00:01:34.229> want<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.560> do<00:01:34.740> is<00:01:35.040> if

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
another thing that we want to do is if

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.010 
another thing that we want to do is if
we<00:01:35.520> receive<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:35.939> call<00:01:36.210> we<00:01:36.420> want<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.659> be<00:01:36.750> able<00:01:36.840> to

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
we receive a call we want to be able to

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:43.429 
we receive a call we want to be able to
transfer<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.619> call<00:01:38.060> so<00:01:39.060> if<00:01:39.090> I<00:01:39.689> dialed<00:01:40.400> 126<00:01:42.439> made

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
transfer a call so if I dialed 126 made

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.929 
transfer a call so if I dialed 126 made
that<00:01:43.649> call<00:01:45.140> answer<00:01:46.140> that<00:01:46.320> call<00:01:46.560> now<00:01:46.860> I<00:01:47.490> can<00:01:47.729> see

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
that call answer that call now I can see

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.840 
that call answer that call now I can see
that<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.270> transfer<00:01:48.750> shows<00:01:49.590> up<00:01:49.860> here<00:01:50.220> so<00:01:50.820> I

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
that the transfer shows up here so I

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.770 
that the transfer shows up here so I
could<00:01:50.970> actually<00:01:51.240> hit<00:01:51.600> that

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
could actually hit that

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.980 
could actually hit that
to<00:01:53.170> transfer<00:01:53.680> the<00:01:53.799> call<00:01:54.040> and<00:01:54.630> dial<00:01:55.630> whatever

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
to transfer the call and dial whatever

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:02.539 
to transfer the call and dial whatever
three<00:01:56.290> number<00:01:56.680> extension<00:01:57.670> I<00:01:57.760> wanted<00:01:58.060> to<00:01:58.180> go<00:01:58.330> to

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.109 

so<00:02:03.549> that's<00:02:03.729> how<00:02:03.880> you<00:02:03.940> transfer<00:02:04.509> a<00:02:04.540> call

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
so that's how you transfer a call

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.719 
so that's how you transfer a call
another<00:02:07.119> thing<00:02:07.360> is<00:02:07.390> to<00:02:07.810> put<00:02:07.990> a<00:02:08.020> call<00:02:08.259> on<00:02:08.470> hold

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
another thing is to put a call on hold

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:15.960 
another thing is to put a call on hold
so<00:02:09.729> if<00:02:10.090> I<00:02:10.890> receive<00:02:11.890> a<00:02:11.920> call<00:02:13.830> and<00:02:14.830> I<00:02:15.430> pick<00:02:15.670> it<00:02:15.700> up

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
so if I receive a call and I pick it up

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.390 
so if I receive a call and I pick it up
and<00:02:16.390> now<00:02:17.020> I<00:02:17.050> want<00:02:17.410> to<00:02:17.470> put<00:02:17.590> this<00:02:17.709> call<00:02:17.950> and<00:02:18.130> hold

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
and now I want to put this call and hold

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.490 
and now I want to put this call and hold
I'm<00:02:18.910> going<00:02:19.150> to<00:02:19.209> use<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:19.569> hold<00:02:19.840> button<00:02:19.930> here

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
I'm going to use the hold button here

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.350 
I'm going to use the hold button here
and<00:02:22.560> so<00:02:23.560> now<00:02:23.800> I'm<00:02:24.580> going<00:02:24.730> to<00:02:24.790> take<00:02:24.880> that<00:02:24.940> off<00:02:25.209> so

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
and so now I'm going to take that off so

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.270 
and so now I'm going to take that off so
we<00:02:25.420> don't<00:02:25.600> hear<00:02:25.840> it<00:02:25.989> so<00:02:26.470> now<00:02:26.620> this<00:02:26.800> called<00:02:27.130> us

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
extension 126 I could actually go to

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:51.300 
extension 126 I could actually go to
another<00:02:46.690> phone<00:02:47.080> I<00:02:47.380> can<00:02:48.100> dial<00:02:49.080> extension<00:02:50.310> 126

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.420 
extension 113 so i type in run on three
and<00:05:02.090> then<00:05:03.090> i<00:05:03.210> hit<00:05:03.360> n<00:05:03.570> call<00:05:03.930> now<00:05:04.890> we<00:05:04.950> can<00:05:05.250> see
