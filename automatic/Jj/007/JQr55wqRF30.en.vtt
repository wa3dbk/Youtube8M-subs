00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.840
 I do not know if my only true this video 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:17.789
 I do not know if there is sound now 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:23.160
 I am to many taste and in the 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:25.859
 lights of you well the system on 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.160
 the operational I do not visit the systems 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:47.790
 nobody saw the harbor and I myself 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:50.430
 otherwise its maturation number 2 today 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.600
 I will share with you a reflex to 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.360
 to have when you do some exploration 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.129
 but not necessarily to have done 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.689
 the fees since I lost some 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.640
 percentages of roosters arriving near 

00:00:57.689 --> 00:01:01.830
 a star a little too close 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.610
 of a star in an unknown system 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:07.710
 so repeat that I have now and 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.820
 that I make myself surrender that the 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.970
 countdown is running 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.710
 as currently where as soon as the 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.160
 ship is a super cruz like 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.260
 now I'm going to 0 engines that's 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.270
 a huge advantage because as soon as we 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.340
 arrives near the star of destination 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.920
 the speed of the ship will fall 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.710
 immediately at 30 km second what is 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.290
 its minimum speed in super cruz and 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.820
 it's something that you should 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.460
 to avoid having bad 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:39.140
 surprises in any case it's a 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:42.960
 technique that I find unstoppable and who 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:45.450
 clean the ship since that's when 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.550
 even paradoxical screw on the ship in 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.909
 explodes I have nothing better 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.800
 listen 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.200
 I hope this little SLR will be you 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.150
 helpful I leave you now with 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.920
 some pictures 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.920
 see you soon have fun 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.230
 and
