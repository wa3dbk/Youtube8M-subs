spill it if I wasn't videotaping this I

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.750 
spill it if I wasn't videotaping this I
would<00:01:28.200> just<00:01:28.439> latch<00:01:28.680> it<00:01:28.890> on<00:01:29.040> here<00:01:29.369> which<00:01:29.610> would

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:29.760 
would just latch it on here which would

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.780 
would just latch it on here which would
keep<00:01:29.909> it<00:01:30.090> upright<00:01:30.299> but<00:01:31.020> we'll<00:01:31.229> just<00:01:31.260> let<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:31.710> go

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.240 

yeah<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:36.390> hope<00:01:36.780> it<00:01:36.930> doesn't<00:01:36.960> spill<00:01:37.650> because

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
yeah and hope it doesn't spill because

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:46.380 
yeah and hope it doesn't spill because
that<00:01:38.430> would<00:01:38.580> suck<00:01:41.750> anyway<00:01:42.890> yeah

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:57.880 

electrolytes<00:01:47.390> for<00:01:47.660> ultra<00:01:48.410> running<00:01:48.640> perfect
