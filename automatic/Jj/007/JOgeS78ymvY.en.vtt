the crescendo audio super - did I have I

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:19.820 
the crescendo audio super - did I have I
start<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.279> black<00:00:17.460> one<00:00:17.699> over<00:00:17.850> there<00:00:18.060> and<00:00:18.800> I<00:00:19.800> got

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
start the black one over there and I got

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.250 
start the black one over there and I got
the<00:00:20.539> -<00:00:21.539> oh<00:00:21.720> yeah

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260

the - oh yeah
I<00:00:22.490> think<00:00:23.490> think<00:00:23.640> these<00:00:23.760> look<00:00:23.970> better<00:00:24.150> with<00:00:24.449> the

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
I think think these look better with the

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.689 
I think think these look better with the
office<00:00:25.019> they're<00:00:25.289> new<00:00:25.439> pwx<00:00:26.070> is<00:00:26.220> that's<00:00:26.369> in<00:00:26.519> here

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
office they're new pwx is that's in here

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:46.130 
office they're new pwx is that's in here
too<00:00:26.880> but<00:00:27.140> the<00:00:28.140> black<00:00:28.349> on<00:00:28.560> black<00:00:42.860> I<00:00:44.960> got<00:00:45.960> these

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
too but the black on black I got these

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.410 
too but the black on black I got these
wired<00:00:46.440> at<00:00:46.770> our<00:00:46.920> 8<00:00:47.280> ohms<00:00:47.520> so<00:00:47.879> I<00:00:47.940> got<00:00:48.149> them<00:00:48.239> all

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
wired at our 8 ohms so I got them all

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.150 
wired at our 8 ohms so I got them all
hooked<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.719> get<00:00:48.870> all<00:00:49.200> hooked<00:00:49.469> up<00:00:49.620> together<00:00:49.770> why

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
hooked to get all hooked up together why

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.020 
hooked to get all hooked up together why
the<00:00:50.219> 8<00:00:50.520> ohms<00:00:50.930> crossed<00:00:51.930> over<00:00:52.170> at<00:00:52.410> 4500<00:00:53.309> Hertz<00:00:53.520> so

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
the 8 ohms crossed over at 4500 Hertz so

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.590 
the 8 ohms crossed over at 4500 Hertz so
and<00:00:54.870> I<00:00:55.079> actually<00:00:55.230> got<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.559> selenium<00:00:56.600> passive

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
and I actually got a selenium passive

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.720 
and I actually got a selenium passive
crossover<00:00:58.079> made<00:00:58.920> just<00:00:59.280> for<00:00:59.399> these<00:00:59.520> super

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
crossover made just for these super

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.080 
crossover made just for these super
tweeter<00:01:00.000> so<00:01:00.359> they<00:01:01.320> should<00:01:01.559> actually<00:01:01.910> come<00:01:02.910> out

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
tweeter so they should actually come out

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.000 
tweeter so they should actually come out
a<00:01:03.120> lot<00:01:03.270> better<00:01:03.510> not<00:01:03.840> cleaner<00:01:04.199> especially<00:01:04.769> for

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
a lot better not cleaner especially for

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.120 
a lot better not cleaner especially for
him<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.189> be<00:01:05.280> running<00:01:05.489> at<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.270> tone<00:01:06.479> so<00:01:07.130> there

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
him to be running at a tone so there

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.230 
him to be running at a tone so there
really<00:01:08.280> ain't<00:01:08.460> too<00:01:08.640> bad

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
really ain't too bad

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.500 
really ain't too bad

like on the fifth day and apparently I'm

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.080 
like on the fifth day and apparently I'm
not<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.650> only<00:01:31.890> one<00:01:32.159> who<00:01:32.400> having<00:01:32.640> problem<00:01:33.000> with

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
not the only one who having problem with

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.170 
not the only one who having problem with
the<00:01:33.210> PW<00:01:33.570> X's<00:01:34.110> mainly<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.829> six<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.280> half

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
the PW X's mainly the six and a half

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.780 
the PW X's mainly the six and a half
apparently<00:01:37.140> it's<00:01:37.259> intensively<00:01:37.799> problem<00:01:38.520> or

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
apparently it's intensively problem or

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.249 
apparently it's intensively problem or
something<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.390> shorts<00:01:39.720> out<00:01:39.869> because<00:01:40.140> they

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
something that shorts out because they

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.410 
something that shorts out because they
don't<00:01:40.380> have<00:01:40.530> enough<00:01:40.770> epoxy<00:01:41.280> on<00:01:41.430> it<00:01:41.579> or<00:01:42.180> they

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
don't have enough epoxy on it or they

don't have enough epoxy on it or they
don't<00:01:42.600> have<00:01:42.750> epoxy<00:01:43.380> on<00:01:43.530> it<00:01:43.560> at<00:01:44.460> all

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
don't have epoxy on it at all

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.389

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
so I'll talk to the guy that I think it

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.999 
so I'll talk to the guy that I think it
needed<00:01:47.610> nabbit<00:01:48.149> from<00:01:48.780> crescendo<00:01:49.320> if<00:01:49.770> that's

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
needed nabbit from crescendo if that's

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.399 
needed nabbit from crescendo if that's
him<00:01:50.189> that<00:01:50.399> I'm<00:01:50.520> talking<00:01:50.729> to

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
he's sending me out to more replacements

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.170 
he's sending me out to more replacements
plus<00:01:55.229> three<00:01:55.560> more<00:01:55.740> than<00:01:55.890> our<00:01:56.040> bolts<00:01:56.430> so<00:01:56.610> and

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180

they were saying that the new bed that
he<00:01:59.100> said<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.310> best<00:01:59.520> that<00:01:59.820> I<00:01:59.939> had<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.540> other

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
people had could have been a bad batch

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.530 
people had could have been a bad batch
so<00:02:03.360> I<00:02:03.680> mean<00:02:04.680> when<00:02:05.460> I<00:02:05.490> press<00:02:05.820> I<00:02:05.969> wanted<00:02:06.210> to<00:02:06.270> play

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
so I mean when I press I wanted to play

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.779 
so I mean when I press I wanted to play
and<00:02:07.079> when<00:02:07.469> it's<00:02:07.619> like<00:02:07.799> when<00:02:08.129> I'm<00:02:08.220> not<00:02:08.369> personal

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
and when it's like when I'm not personal

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.160 
and when it's like when I'm not personal
I'm<00:02:08.910> not<00:02:09.060> pressing<00:02:09.270> on<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.539> color

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
I'm not pressing on the color

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.860 
I'm not pressing on the color
not<00:02:11.319> even<00:02:11.530> playing<00:02:11.890> so<00:02:12.420> both<00:02:13.420> of<00:02:13.450> these<00:02:13.630> fish

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
not even playing so both of these fish

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.870 
not even playing so both of these fish
enough<00:02:14.140> to<00:02:14.319> design<00:02:14.650> we're<00:02:15.130> not<00:02:15.250> treated<00:02:15.790> but
