00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
and and so it's hard to not have that I

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.230 
and and so it's hard to not have that I
would<00:01:40.259> look<00:01:40.439> at<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.649> same<00:01:40.830> time<00:01:41.100> I<00:01:41.399> have

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240

managed<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.750> create<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.409> conditions<00:01:43.799> somehow

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
managed to create the conditions somehow

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.480 
managed to create the conditions somehow
magically<00:01:44.670> that<00:01:45.210> where<00:01:45.810> I<00:01:45.840> do<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.200> show<00:01:46.470> that<00:01:46.500> is

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490
