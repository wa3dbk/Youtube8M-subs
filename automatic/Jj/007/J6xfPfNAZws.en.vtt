00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
strong passed pawns so again he's like

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.180

to the opponent and you know if we took

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.280 
to the opponent and you know if we took
this<00:02:37.850> the<00:02:38.240> same<00:02:38.480> notion<00:02:38.870> that<00:02:38.960> he's<00:02:39.140> just

applied to the other man elements then

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.090 
applied to the other man elements then
obviously<00:02:41.390> there's<00:02:42.320> a<00:02:42.410> hint<00:02:42.680> that<00:02:42.770> you<00:02:42.980> know

obviously there's a hint that you know

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.560 
obviously there's a hint that you know
maybe<00:02:43.280> you're<00:02:43.460> trying<00:02:43.700> to<00:02:43.790> get<00:02:43.940> superior

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
maybe you're trying to get superior

maybe you're trying to get superior
pawns<00:02:44.840> the<00:02:45.140> opponent's<00:02:45.620> you<00:02:45.710> know<00:02:45.800> you're

to trump the opponent on the imbalances
in<00:02:57.860> the<00:02:58.070> position<00:02:58.960> so<00:02:59.960> at<00:03:00.620> this<00:03:00.770> stage<00:03:00.980> you

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
in the position so at this stage you

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.610 
in the position so at this stage you
know<00:03:01.370> it's<00:03:01.550> not<00:03:01.760> all<00:03:02.510> about<00:03:02.810> the<00:03:02.930> technical

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
know it's not all about the technical

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.360 
know it's not all about the technical
stuff<00:03:03.890> which<00:03:04.730> you<00:03:05.300> know<00:03:05.420> this<00:03:05.840> machine-like

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
stuff which you know this machine-like

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.060 
stuff which you know this machine-like
calculation<00:03:07.370> of<00:03:07.550> variations<00:03:08.800> these<00:03:09.800> are<00:03:10.010> the

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
calculation of variations these are the

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:11.830 
calculation of variations these are the
preliminary<00:03:10.250> stages<00:03:10.880> which<00:03:11.180> cause<00:03:11.450> of<00:03:11.660> is

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
preliminary stages which cause of is

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.100 
preliminary stages which cause of is
describing<00:03:12.680> as<00:03:12.800> an<00:03:12.920> introduction<00:03:13.840> so<00:03:14.840> he<00:03:14.960> goes

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
describing as an introduction so he goes

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:16.840 
describing as an introduction so he goes
on<00:03:15.440> now<00:03:15.680> to<00:03:15.740> talk<00:03:16.070> about<00:03:16.100> something<00:03:16.490> even<00:03:16.730> more

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
on now to talk about something even more

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.120 
on now to talk about something even more
subtle<00:03:17.270> it<00:03:17.570> says<00:03:17.900> in<00:03:18.170> a<00:03:18.260> more<00:03:18.440> subconscious

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
subtle it says in a more subconscious

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.130 
subtle it says in a more subconscious
than<00:03:19.790> conscious<00:03:20.270> way<00:03:20.420> he'll<00:03:20.600> establish<00:03:20.960> where

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
than conscious way he'll establish where

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.890 
than conscious way he'll establish where
there<00:03:21.290> is<00:03:21.380> cooperation<00:03:22.070> and<00:03:22.790> harmony<00:03:23.090> between

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
there is cooperation and harmony between

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.310 
there is cooperation and harmony between
his<00:03:24.380> pieces<00:03:24.740> I<00:03:25.510> likewise<00:03:26.510> for<00:03:26.780> the<00:03:26.840> opponent

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
his pieces I likewise for the opponent

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.290 
his pieces I likewise for the opponent
so<00:03:27.860> he's<00:03:27.980> actually<00:03:28.160> talking<00:03:28.550> about<00:03:28.580> trumping

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.300 
so he's actually talking about trumping

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:30.820 
so he's actually talking about trumping
the<00:03:29.330> opponent's<00:03:29.780> for<00:03:29.930> teaching<00:03:30.260> in<00:03:30.440> terms<00:03:30.650> of

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
the opponent's for teaching in terms of

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.010 
the opponent's for teaching in terms of
cooperation<00:03:31.730> and<00:03:32.000> harmony<00:03:32.240> maybe<00:03:32.690> there's<00:03:32.930> a

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:33.020 
cooperation and harmony maybe there's a

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.130 
cooperation and harmony maybe there's a
way<00:03:33.260> of<00:03:33.560> Disick<00:03:34.280> locating<00:03:35.240> the<00:03:35.690> harmony<00:03:36.110> of

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
way of Disick locating the harmony of

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.540 
way of Disick locating the harmony of
the<00:03:36.260> opponent's<00:03:36.650> pieces<00:03:36.800> you<00:03:37.010> know<00:03:37.100> say<00:03:37.310> so

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:37.550 
the opponent's pieces you know say so

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.760 
the opponent's pieces you know say so
you<00:03:37.610> had<00:03:37.760> a<00:03:37.790> knight<00:03:38.320> dislocating<00:03:39.320> the

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:39.770 
you had a knight dislocating the

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:41.380 
you had a knight dislocating the
opponent<00:03:40.160> you<00:03:40.220> know<00:03:40.310> if<00:03:40.490> you<00:03:40.580> had<00:03:40.700> it<00:03:40.820> on<00:03:40.880> d4

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
opponent you know if you had it on d4

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.000 
opponent you know if you had it on d4
you<00:03:41.540> know<00:03:41.630> if<00:03:41.720> he<00:03:41.840> punt<00:03:42.020> asked<00:03:42.200> to<00:03:42.290> take<00:03:42.470> on<00:03:42.680> d4

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
you know if he punt asked to take on d4

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.560 
you know if he punt asked to take on d4
you<00:03:43.160> could<00:03:43.310> dislocate<00:03:43.610> the<00:03:44.210> opponent's

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570 
you could dislocate the opponent's

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.080 
you could dislocate the opponent's
position<00:03:44.690> I<00:03:45.200> guess<00:03:45.860> so<00:03:46.070> so<00:03:46.640> you<00:03:46.700> know<00:03:46.940> he's

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
position I guess so so you know he's

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.120 
position I guess so so you know he's

who<00:04:11.270> takes<00:04:11.570> quite<00:04:12.350> a<00:04:12.380> critical<00:04:12.650> you<00:04:13.160> know

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
who takes quite a critical you know

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.130 
who takes quite a critical you know
outlook<00:04:13.850> on<00:04:14.290> cata<00:04:15.290> of<00:04:15.470> some<00:04:16.120> subsequent

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.140 
outlook on cata of some subsequent

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.370 
outlook on cata of some subsequent
implied<00:04:18.140> stages<00:04:18.710> of<00:04:18.830> a<00:04:18.890> grandmaster<00:04:19.250> thinking

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
implied stages of a grandmaster thinking

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.530 
implied stages of a grandmaster thinking
so<00:04:21.380> basically<00:04:21.830> it's<00:04:22.610> the<00:04:22.760> assessment<00:04:23.300> here

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540 
so basically it's the assessment here

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.520 
so basically it's the assessment here
staged<00:04:24.440> here<00:04:24.710> which<00:04:24.860> I<00:04:25.040> recognize<00:04:25.610> most<00:04:26.530> and

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
staged here which I recognize most and

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.440 
staged here which I recognize most and
then<00:04:27.770> you<00:04:27.950> know<00:04:28.040> cut<00:04:28.340> off<00:04:28.550> basically<00:04:29.090> says<00:04:29.300> the

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
then you know cut off basically says the

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.810 
then you know cut off basically says the
grandmasters<00:04:30.020> thoughts<00:04:30.370> you<00:04:31.370> know<00:04:31.400> have<00:04:31.669> been

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
grandmasters thoughts you know have been

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.129 
grandmasters thoughts you know have been
based<00:04:32.060> on<00:04:32.240> general<00:04:32.630> idea

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:33.139 
based on general idea

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:36.969 
based on general idea
pratik<00:04:33.860> principles<00:04:35.139> yes<00:04:36.139> I<00:04:36.379> recognize<00:04:36.949> that

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:36.979 
pratik principles yes I recognize that

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:39.279 
pratik principles yes I recognize that
in<00:04:37.659> particular<00:04:38.659> you<00:04:38.960> know<00:04:39.080> how<00:04:39.229> to

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:39.289 
in particular you know how to

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:40.869 
in particular you know how to
strategically<00:04:40.039> crush<00:04:40.340> the<00:04:40.490> opponent<00:04:40.789> I<00:04:40.849> don't

00:04:40.869 --> 00:04:40.879 
strategically crush the opponent I don't

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:44.909 
strategically crush the opponent I don't
think<00:04:41.330> that's<00:04:41.509> you<00:04:41.749> know<00:04:41.779> the<00:04:41.960> foremost<00:04:42.789> idea

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
think that's you know the foremost idea

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:47.350 
think that's you know the foremost idea
but<00:04:45.919> now<00:04:46.099> concept<00:04:46.520> says<00:04:46.669> now<00:04:46.909> he'll<00:04:47.180> start

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
but now concept says now he'll start

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.450 
but now concept says now he'll start
looking<00:04:47.930> for<00:04:47.960> the<00:04:48.319> best<00:04:48.529> move<00:04:48.889> he<00:04:49.400> will

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
looking for the best move he will

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.189 
looking for the best move he will
establish<00:04:49.580> what<00:04:50.150> moves<00:04:50.389> are<00:04:50.569> possible<00:04:50.719> and

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:51.199 
establish what moves are possible and

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:53.589 
establish what moves are possible and
how<00:04:51.680> they<00:04:51.889> fit<00:04:52.069> in<00:04:52.249> with<00:04:52.279> the<00:04:52.490> plan<00:04:52.759> and<00:04:53.479> then

00:04:53.589 --> 00:04:53.599 
how they fit in with the plan and then

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:56.170 
how they fit in with the plan and then
analyzing<00:04:54.050> the<00:04:54.229> variations<00:04:54.710> as<00:04:55.249> it's<00:04:55.789> in<00:04:55.999> this

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.180 
analyzing the variations as it's in this

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:01.239 
analyzing the variations as it's in this
technical<00:04:56.599> stage<00:04:57.020> which<00:04:57.289> am<00:04:57.590> i<00:04:59.439> come<00:05:00.439> very

00:05:01.239 --> 00:05:01.249 
technical stage which am i come very

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:03.820 
technical stage which am i come very
uncomfortable<00:05:02.150> with<00:05:02.389> some<00:05:03.080> of<00:05:03.169> the<00:05:03.259> examples

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:03.830 
uncomfortable with some of the examples

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.670 
uncomfortable with some of the examples
and<00:05:04.099> this<00:05:04.699> is<00:05:04.879> the<00:05:05.389> first<00:05:05.629> example<00:05:06.289> where<00:05:06.469> a

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
and this is the first example where a

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.519 
and this is the first example where a
master<00:05:07.219> apparently<00:05:07.699> yeah<00:05:08.689> you<00:05:09.409> know<00:05:09.500> a

00:05:09.519 --> 00:05:09.529 
master apparently yeah you know a

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:12.070 
master apparently yeah you know a
theoretical<00:05:10.159> master<00:05:10.610> and<00:05:10.819> had<00:05:11.509> this<00:05:11.689> position

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
theoretical master and had this position

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:17.409 
theoretical master and had this position
with<00:05:12.289> white<00:05:12.580> and<00:05:13.870> you<00:05:14.870> know<00:05:15.639> said<00:05:16.639> he<00:05:16.819> wanted

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:17.419 
with white and you know said he wanted

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:19.869 
with white and you know said he wanted
the<00:05:17.509> sacrifice<00:05:17.990> but<00:05:18.259> which<00:05:18.469> piece<00:05:18.800> and<00:05:19.129> he<00:05:19.610> he

00:05:19.869 --> 00:05:19.879 
the sacrifice but which piece and he he

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:21.730 
the sacrifice but which piece and he he
was<00:05:19.969> looking<00:05:20.270> at<00:05:20.360> like<00:05:20.539> you<00:05:21.289> know<00:05:21.319> several

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
was looking at like you know several

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.490 
was looking at like you know several
kinds<00:05:22.219> of<00:05:22.250> eight<00:05:22.400> sacrifices<00:05:23.210> here<00:05:23.479> so<00:05:24.439> you

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:24.500 
kinds of eight sacrifices here so you

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.409 
kinds of eight sacrifices here so you
know<00:05:24.740> what<00:05:24.949> sacrifices<00:05:25.520> would<00:05:25.849> you<00:05:26.000> consider

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:26.419 
know what sacrifices would you consider

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:28.450 
know what sacrifices would you consider
in<00:05:26.750> this<00:05:26.839> position<00:05:27.229> obviously<00:05:27.710> you<00:05:28.189> know<00:05:28.279> why

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.460 
in this position obviously you know why

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:29.829 
in this position obviously you know why
it's<00:05:28.610> got<00:05:28.759> some<00:05:28.939> dangerous<00:05:29.180> you<00:05:29.719> know

00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:29.839 
it's got some dangerous you know

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:31.570 
it's got some dangerous you know
attacking<00:05:30.259> pieces<00:05:30.680> this<00:05:30.889> bishop<00:05:31.219> on<00:05:31.400> this

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:31.580 
attacking pieces this bishop on this

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.700 
attacking pieces this bishop on this
diagonal<00:05:31.909> this<00:05:32.509> rook<00:05:32.779> here<00:05:32.990> this<00:05:33.229> Queen's

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:33.710 
diagonal this rook here this Queen's

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.760 
diagonal this rook here this Queen's
nice<00:05:34.370> the<00:05:34.639> knight<00:05:34.819> outpost<00:05:35.270> in<00:05:35.479> fact<00:05:36.139> and<00:05:36.439> this

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:36.770 
nice the knight outpost in fact and this

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:38.740 
nice the knight outpost in fact and this
is<00:05:36.919> a<00:05:36.949> type<00:05:37.279> of<00:05:37.310> position<00:05:37.819> where<00:05:38.120> the<00:05:38.330> isolated

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:38.750 
is a type of position where the isolated

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:40.899 
is a type of position where the isolated
Queen<00:05:39.110> pawn<00:05:39.379> is<00:05:39.500> offering<00:05:39.919> a<00:05:40.069> nice<00:05:40.250> outpost

00:05:40.899 --> 00:05:40.909 
Queen pawn is offering a nice outpost

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:45.189 
Queen pawn is offering a nice outpost
for<00:05:41.719> the<00:05:41.779> e5<00:05:42.289> Knight<00:05:42.620> so<00:05:43.400> if<00:05:43.930> black<00:05:44.930> can

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:45.199 
for the e5 Knight so if black can

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:47.230 
for the e5 Knight so if black can
survive<00:05:45.560> the<00:05:45.800> attack<00:05:46.159> then<00:05:46.789> you<00:05:47.120> know

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:47.240 
survive the attack then you know

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.360 
survive the attack then you know
structurally<00:05:47.839> you<00:05:48.020> know<00:05:48.110> then<00:05:48.800> White's<00:05:49.069> had

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:49.370 
structurally you know then White's had

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:52.420 
structurally you know then White's had
it<00:05:50.199> so<00:05:51.199> what<00:05:51.439> has<00:05:51.620> to<00:05:51.740> make<00:05:51.919> the<00:05:52.039> most<00:05:52.219> out<00:05:52.370> of

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:52.430 
it so what has to make the most out of

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.879 
it so what has to make the most out of
this<00:05:52.610> attack<00:05:53.000> so<00:05:53.599> there<00:05:53.750> are<00:05:53.870> various<00:05:54.229> moves

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:54.889 
this attack so there are various moves

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:58.570 
this attack so there are various moves
which<00:05:55.449> you<00:05:56.449> can<00:05:56.659> concretely<00:05:57.580> calculate

00:05:58.570 --> 00:05:58.580 
which you can concretely calculate

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.200 
which you can concretely calculate
because<00:05:58.759> they're<00:05:58.939> forcing<00:05:59.479> in<00:05:59.599> nature<00:06:00.080> and

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.210 
because they're forcing in nature and

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:03.459 
because they're forcing in nature and
you<00:06:02.210> know<00:06:02.330> maybe<00:06:02.539> you<00:06:02.839> know<00:06:02.960> this<00:06:03.169> this

00:06:03.459 --> 00:06:03.469 
you know maybe you know this this

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:06.269 
you know maybe you know this this
example<00:06:03.680> is<00:06:04.310> is<00:06:04.659> it's<00:06:05.659> kind<00:06:05.899> of<00:06:05.990> where

00:06:06.269 --> 00:06:06.279 
example is is it's kind of where

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:08.800 
example is is it's kind of where
calculation<00:06:07.279> should<00:06:08.029> in<00:06:08.180> theory<00:06:08.419> excel

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:08.810 
calculation should in theory excel

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:10.360 
calculation should in theory excel
because<00:06:08.990> there<00:06:09.349> are<00:06:09.469> for<00:06:09.770> example<00:06:09.800> you<00:06:10.250> know

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:10.370 
because there are for example you know

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.129 
because there are for example you know
there's<00:06:10.879> the<00:06:11.029> concrete<00:06:11.389> forcing<00:06:11.779> move<00:06:11.930> rook

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:12.139 
there's the concrete forcing move rook

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:14.559 
there's the concrete forcing move rook
takes<00:06:12.379> Knight<00:06:12.770> or<00:06:13.069> Bishop<00:06:13.699> takes<00:06:13.939> pawn<00:06:14.089> or

00:06:14.559 --> 00:06:14.569 
takes Knight or Bishop takes pawn or

Knight<00:06:15.080> takes<00:06:15.439> pawn<00:06:15.849> or<00:06:16.849> Knight<00:06:17.300> g4<00:06:17.779> even

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:18.169 
Knight takes pawn or Knight g4 even

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:21.129 
Knight takes pawn or Knight g4 even

attacking the Queen or even Bishop takes
pawn<00:06:21.259> so<00:06:21.949> how<00:06:22.099> would<00:06:22.159> you<00:06:22.279> go<00:06:22.520> about<00:06:22.639> looking

00:06:23.429 --> 00:06:23.439 
pawn so how would you go about looking

00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:28.089 
pawn so how would you go about looking
at<00:06:24.439> all<00:06:24.649> these<00:06:24.830> forcing<00:06:25.430> moves<00:06:25.819> and<00:06:27.069> what<00:06:28.069> I

00:06:28.089 --> 00:06:28.099 
at all these forcing moves and what I

00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:30.790 
at all these forcing moves and what I
have<00:06:28.520> along<00:06:29.060> comfort<00:06:29.539> with<00:06:29.719> is<00:06:29.960> the

have along comfort with is the

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:35.379 
have along comfort with is the
calculation<00:06:31.479> of<00:06:32.830> candidate<00:06:33.830> moves<00:06:34.129> is<00:06:34.460> best

00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:35.389 
calculation of candidate moves is best

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:40.719 
calculation of candidate moves is best
on<00:06:35.659> with<00:06:36.259> computers<00:06:36.889> if<00:06:37.300> it<00:06:38.300> is<00:06:38.509> a<00:06:39.159> raw<00:06:40.159> process

that initial stage before coming down to
the<00:07:18.500> concrete<00:07:18.680> variations<00:07:19.750> but<00:07:20.750> anyway<00:07:21.050> so

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:21.440 
the concrete variations but anyway so

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.200 
the concrete variations but anyway so
console<00:07:21.860> says<00:07:22.130> you<00:07:22.460> know<00:07:22.550> the<00:07:22.670> master<00:07:23.090> was

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:23.210 
console says you know the master was

console says you know the master was
looking<00:07:23.660> at<00:07:23.750> different<00:07:24.140> candidate<00:07:24.590> moves

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:24.800 
looking at different candidate moves

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:29.260 
looking at different candidate moves
here<00:07:25.130> and<00:07:27.340> so<00:07:28.340> he<00:07:28.460> looked<00:07:28.670> at<00:07:28.850> apparently

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:29.270 
here and so he looked at apparently

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:31.570 
here and so he looked at apparently
Bishop<00:07:29.600> takes<00:07:29.840> rook<00:07:29.990> spawn<00:07:30.470> so<00:07:31.130> this<00:07:31.280> is<00:07:31.430> in

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:31.580 
Bishop takes rook spawn so this is in

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:34.120 
Bishop takes rook spawn so this is in
the<00:07:31.700> old<00:07:31.960> notation<00:07:32.960> harmony<00:07:33.590> Bishop<00:07:33.920> takes

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:34.130 
the old notation harmony Bishop takes

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:38.680 
the old notation harmony Bishop takes
rook<00:07:35.080> spawn<00:07:36.100> the<00:07:37.100> Knight<00:07:37.340> takes<00:07:37.670> Knight<00:07:37.790> was

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:38.690 
rook spawn the Knight takes Knight was

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:43.180 
rook spawn the Knight takes Knight was
another<00:07:39.170> possibility<00:07:40.660> night<00:07:41.660> tonight<00:07:42.380> for<00:07:42.410> is

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:43.190 
another possibility night tonight for is

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:45.370 
another possibility night tonight for is
another<00:07:43.580> possibility<00:07:44.020> so<00:07:45.020> these<00:07:45.140> are<00:07:45.290> all

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:45.380 
another possibility so these are all

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:49.420 
another possibility so these are all
forcing<00:07:45.830> moves<00:07:46.040> so<00:07:46.250> far<00:07:47.920> but<00:07:48.920> night<00:07:49.160> tonight

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:49.430 
forcing moves so far but night tonight
