00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.610 
then here are the two hoops
to<00:02:32.860> keep<00:02:33.129> your<00:02:33.690> earbuds<00:02:34.690> in<00:02:34.870> so<00:02:35.230> that<00:02:35.440> if

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
to keep your earbuds in so that if

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.900 
to keep your earbuds in so that if
you're<00:02:35.860> going<00:02:36.069> to<00:02:36.220> go<00:02:36.430> running<00:02:37.739> whoops<00:02:38.910> then

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
you're going to go running whoops then

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.559 
you're going to go running whoops then
you're<00:02:40.720> going<00:02:40.840> to<00:02:40.930> have<00:02:41.049> a<00:02:41.110> bit<00:02:41.410> more<00:02:41.620> security

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
you're going to have a bit more security

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:48.030 
you're going to have a bit more security
keeping<00:02:43.739> your<00:02:44.739> earbuds<00:02:45.310> in<00:02:46.379> because<00:02:47.379> they<00:02:47.769> are

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
keeping your earbuds in because they are

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.360 
keeping your earbuds in because they are
attached<00:02:48.849> to<00:02:49.090> your<00:02:49.180> hat<00:02:49.799> so<00:02:50.799> it's<00:02:50.920> just<00:02:51.099> going

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
attached to your hat so it's just going

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:57.150 
attached to your hat so it's just going
to<00:02:51.459> keep<00:02:51.609> it<00:02:52.290> around<00:02:53.290> a<00:02:53.560> bit<00:02:53.739> more<00:02:55.920> let's<00:02:56.920> just

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
to keep it around a bit more let's just

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.289 
to keep it around a bit more let's just
put<00:02:57.400> those<00:02:57.549> in<00:02:59.010> so<00:03:00.010> yeah<00:03:00.099> so<00:03:00.819> there<00:03:01.030> you<00:03:01.150> go<00:03:01.269> so

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299 
put those in so yeah so there you go so

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:06.420 
put those in so yeah so there you go so
you<00:03:02.230> can<00:03:03.269> have<00:03:04.269> your<00:03:04.420> hat<00:03:04.629> and<00:03:05.109> then<00:03:05.890> put<00:03:06.220> your

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
you can have your hat and then put your

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.789 
you can have your hat and then put your
earbuds<00:03:06.970> into<00:03:07.750> your<00:03:07.870> ears<00:03:08.109> and<00:03:08.410> they<00:03:08.560> should

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
earbuds into your ears and they should

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:11.940 
earbuds into your ears and they should
stay<00:03:09.099> fairly<00:03:09.400> secure<00:03:09.879> I<00:03:10.230> like<00:03:11.230> this<00:03:11.530> hat<00:03:11.769> I

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
stay fairly secure I like this hat I

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.009 
stay fairly secure I like this hat I
like<00:03:12.160> the<00:03:12.340> color<00:03:12.579> it's<00:03:12.879> great<00:03:13.329> as<00:03:13.540> a<00:03:13.569> travel

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
like the color it's great as a travel

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.890 
like the color it's great as a travel
hat<00:03:14.200> the<00:03:14.410> only<00:03:15.220> improvement<00:03:15.849> I<00:03:16.239> think<00:03:16.720> that

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
hat the only improvement I think that

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.069 
hat the only improvement I think that
could<00:03:17.109> be<00:03:17.139> made<00:03:17.470> on<00:03:17.500> this<00:03:17.919> hat<00:03:18.220> is<00:03:18.840> that<00:03:19.840> there

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079 
could be made on this hat is that there

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:23.129 
could be made on this hat is that there
would<00:03:20.260> be<00:03:20.290> a<00:03:21.269> little<00:03:22.269> hole<00:03:22.510> and<00:03:22.750> I<00:03:22.870> keep

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:23.139 
would be a little hole and I keep

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:26.220 
would be a little hole and I keep
looking<00:03:23.410> to<00:03:23.950> see<00:03:24.130> if<00:03:24.220> there<00:03:24.400> is<00:03:24.430> one<00:03:25.200> but<00:03:26.200> a

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
looking to see if there is one but a

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.309 
looking to see if there is one but a
little<00:03:26.650> hole<00:03:26.950> that<00:03:27.400> would<00:03:27.519> come<00:03:27.849> out<00:03:27.880> of<00:03:28.510> here

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319 
little hole that would come out of here

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:32.550 
little hole that would come out of here
so<00:03:29.889> that<00:03:30.099> actually<00:03:30.480> what<00:03:31.480> I<00:03:31.720> would<00:03:32.019> prefer<00:03:32.349> to

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
so that actually what I would prefer to

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:38.759 
so that actually what I would prefer to
do<00:03:34.590> just<00:03:35.590> take<00:03:35.859> these<00:03:36.040> out<00:03:36.310> again<00:03:37.769> whilst

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
do just take these out again whilst

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.819 
do just take these out again whilst
don't<00:03:39.010> suppose<00:03:39.220> I<00:03:39.370> need<00:03:39.549> to<00:03:39.669> take<00:03:39.970> manage<00:03:40.829> what

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
don't suppose I need to take manage what

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:46.699 
don't suppose I need to take manage what
I<00:03:41.859> would<00:03:42.340> have<00:03:42.489> preferred<00:03:42.910> to<00:03:42.940> do<00:03:43.269> is<00:03:44.160> have<00:03:45.160> my

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
I would have preferred to do is have my

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:56.460 
I would have preferred to do is have my
Nano<00:03:47.709> in<00:03:48.010> here<00:03:50.130> all<00:03:51.130> locked<00:03:51.579> up<00:03:54.480> okay<00:03:55.480> my

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
Nano in here all locked up okay my

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:02.039 
Nano in here all locked up okay my
battery<00:03:56.919> just<00:04:00.000> okay<00:04:01.000> my<00:04:01.209> battery<00:04:01.599> just<00:04:01.629> died

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:02.049 
battery just okay my battery just died

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:06.000 
battery just okay my battery just died
so<00:04:03.209> wonder<00:04:04.209> where<00:04:04.389> I<00:04:04.419> was<00:04:04.720> but<00:04:05.349> what<00:04:05.650> I<00:04:05.680> was

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
so wonder where I was but what I was

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.309 
so wonder where I was but what I was
going<00:04:06.280> to<00:04:06.400> say<00:04:06.519> to<00:04:06.579> make<00:04:07.000> this<00:04:07.209> my<00:04:07.510> ideal<00:04:08.049> that

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 
going to say to make this my ideal that

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:17.789 
going to say to make this my ideal that
what<00:04:09.040> I<00:04:09.310> would<00:04:09.459> love<00:04:10.239> is<00:04:11.250> a<00:04:14.280> hole<00:04:15.280> here

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.170 

but<00:04:18.459> I<00:04:18.489> could<00:04:18.849> thread<00:04:19.269> this<00:04:20.139> in<00:04:20.440> through<00:04:21.180> so

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
but I could thread this in through so

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.950 
but I could thread this in through so
that<00:04:22.449> then<00:04:22.810> I<00:04:23.139> could<00:04:23.530> plug<00:04:23.949> it<00:04:24.129> into<00:04:24.310> there<00:04:25.180> and

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
that then I could plug it into there and

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:35.070 
that then I could plug it into there and
then<00:04:26.470> all<00:04:26.800> this<00:04:27.250> extra<00:04:28.650> cable<00:04:33.419> could<00:04:34.419> go<00:04:34.659> up<00:04:34.840> in

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
then all this extra cable could go up in

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:41.249 
then all this extra cable could go up in
there<00:04:38.729> so<00:04:39.729> then<00:04:40.060> these<00:04:40.270> two<00:04:40.599> bits<00:04:40.900> that<00:04:41.110> were

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:41.259 
there so then these two bits that were

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:45.839 
there so then these two bits that were
this<00:04:41.560> would<00:04:41.800> then<00:04:41.979> be<00:04:42.039> closed<00:04:42.460> obviously<00:04:44.849> and

00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:45.849 
this would then be closed obviously and

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:47.399 
this would then be closed obviously and
these<00:04:46.060> headphone<00:04:46.569> ear<00:04:46.750> bits<00:04:46.900> would<00:04:47.050> be<00:04:47.199> coming

00:04:47.399 --> 00:04:47.409 
these headphone ear bits would be coming

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:51.779 
these headphone ear bits would be coming
out<00:04:47.620> from<00:04:47.889> there<00:04:48.599> so<00:04:49.599> then<00:04:49.930> I<00:04:50.319> could<00:04:51.280> just<00:04:51.490> hook

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:51.789 
out from there so then I could just hook

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:53.309 
out from there so then I could just hook
them<00:04:51.940> into<00:04:52.180> my<00:04:52.300> ears<00:04:52.479> using<00:04:52.690> that<00:04:52.960> they<00:04:53.169> could

00:04:53.309 --> 00:04:53.319 
them into my ears using that they could

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:56.219 
them into my ears using that they could
go<00:04:53.469> through<00:04:53.830> those<00:04:54.060> come<00:04:55.060> out<00:04:55.210> here<00:04:55.479> won't<00:04:56.050> go

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:56.229 
go through those come out here won't go

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:57.540 
go through those come out here won't go
through<00:04:56.409> there<00:04:56.620> one<00:04:56.830> goes<00:04:57.069> through<00:04:57.250> there

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
through there one goes through there

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.570 
through there one goes through there
okay<00:04:58.479> one<00:04:58.690> of<00:04:58.810> them<00:04:58.990> would<00:04:59.139> have<00:04:59.169> to<00:04:59.580> maybe

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
okay one of them would have to maybe

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.610 
okay one of them would have to maybe
have<00:05:00.819> a<00:05:00.849> little<00:05:01.060> loop<00:05:01.389> through<00:05:01.719> there<00:05:01.990> Scott

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
have a little loop through there Scott

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.520 
have a little loop through there Scott
to<00:05:03.009> keep<00:05:03.250> it<00:05:03.460> a<00:05:03.610> little<00:05:03.759> extra<00:05:04.090> loop<00:05:04.479> and<00:05:05.110> but

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
to keep it a little extra loop and but

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.559 
to keep it a little extra loop and but
then<00:05:05.770> why<00:05:06.280> not<00:05:06.340> finished<00:05:06.789> running<00:05:07.030> I<00:05:07.360> could

00:05:07.559 --> 00:05:07.569 
then why not finished running I could

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:09.959 
then why not finished running I could
just<00:05:07.750> take<00:05:07.930> the<00:05:08.110> whole<00:05:08.289> hat<00:05:08.500> off<00:05:08.770> and<00:05:09.580> leave<00:05:09.759> my

00:05:09.959 --> 00:05:09.969 
just take the whole hat off and leave my

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:11.730 
just take the whole hat off and leave my
Nano<00:05:10.180> in<00:05:10.479> there<00:05:10.719> or<00:05:10.870> my<00:05:11.050> shuffle<00:05:11.500> I<00:05:11.590> mean<00:05:11.710> a

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 
Nano in there or my shuffle I mean a

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.409 
Nano in there or my shuffle I mean a
shuffle<00:05:12.190> would<00:05:12.340> be<00:05:12.460> from<00:05:12.699> better<00:05:13.000> because<00:05:13.330> I

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:13.419 
shuffle would be from better because I

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:16.890
