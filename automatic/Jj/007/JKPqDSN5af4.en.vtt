00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.690
 hi friends tankers I am Reason and give out 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.690
 wonderful day we'll talk about 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.540
 american heavy tank level 9 m103 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.640
 in the background is a pretty good fight 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.830
 where we are with a friend from Orenburg briskly 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.949
 asked for a whole direction not without 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.750
 Allied aid course I can 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.390
 congratulate finally bought good 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.840
 headphones with a microphone dns are called they 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.219
 dex blaze if interested in the link under 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.510
 videos can see how they look 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.890
 And I write this review on them 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.140
 why i called the video american dream 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.219
 yes just because it's a dream of yourself 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.360
 does not represent anything 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.890
 beautiful and spectacular but so empty i am 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.320
 pleasure passed great 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.500
 tanks t 29 and t32 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.079
 a whole crowd of masters 1000 Nathan wrought 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.329
 tower damage and an indescribable feeling 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.649
 impunity when taking positions 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:03.660
 where the enemy only sees dozens of tower 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.600
 situations where you understand classmates 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.460
 not fully received a single breakthrough 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.860
 with such inspiration and bought this tank 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.979
 his model is simply superb plan 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.570
 design strong lines beautiful tower yes 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.960
 and in a random when meeting him there were 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.310
 serious problems with breaking through 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.500
 partly because of him, I started to rock 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.840
 this branch just wanted to have such 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.150
 mercedes 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:30.810
 20 fights have passed and something is somehow not 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.000
 it went bad then vanshot in tartu toba kata 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.000
 to standard positions for heavy duty and at least 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.770
 would one ricochet think okay while stock 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.119
 all tanks make you chew your lip and 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:46.100
 sometimes lay foil 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:48.200
 Eager to fall in love with the end of the video I want waiting 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.799
 surprise you about the brown threat 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:54.939
 hanging over us when we play it 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:57.380
 and so passed 280 fights the tank becomes 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:58.580
 tapping already and the tower is good 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.679
 engine and harp 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.619
 the crew got to the cherished 100 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:06.759
 percent think everything will start now 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:09.769
 Naga aga as they say recording water 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:12.709
 punching each fight as if 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:15.170
 play the borscht penetration penetration is still 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.780
 break through broken ammunition commander 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:21.410
 contused you that one is broken there 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:26.410
 loader killed 2 so out of combat foil 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:28.640
 already nifiga can not cope on 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.130
 160 m of the battle had the opportunity 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.049
 I buy a top gun with a large 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.260
 looked at her with curiosity and noted 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:38.840
 what is it different from tapping well 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.319
 very little but requires 60 thousand 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.200
 of experience 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:43.970
 and this is another 100 battles to endure tough 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.280
 desire to assemble the entire computer along with 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:50.450
 monitor into a big bag and give a leg 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:52.190
 20 minutes and did not want all the same there is still 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:56.299
 a lot of tanks which are very nice 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.700
 play my hard tank experience 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:59.379
 quite limited 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.050
 my hangar is beautiful 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:03.190
 the ninth level of the water which can 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.040
 understand and love 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.180
 he frisky with a great gun and german 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.860
 heavy e-75 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.390
 for me it is the ideal weight of the ninth 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.459
 level with excellent armor 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.769
 which beats off thousands of damage 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:18.459
 from acb back puts in half a thousand 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:20.410
 with every shot what does m103 have 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:23.170
 firstly itâ€™s a good gun 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.510
 which after t32 makes a tangible step 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.190
 forward armor penetration can be 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.290
 almost forget the need 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.390
 to roll a large amount of gold 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.180
 and about almost all classmates 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:37.690
 slight problems may arise 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.220
 a gain of only 10 but they don't care 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.980
 sewn in vulnerabilities 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.940
 somehow the lower armor turret either 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.849
 rollers at an angle 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:48.220
 them what else are very good angles 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:51.069
 vertical pickup 8 degrees down 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:53.940
 and at 15 up speed dial 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:56.829
 true maximum speed only 34 cenotaph hour 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:59.860
 very strong mask weapon weapons 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:02.739
 which keeps hitting even from pt level 10 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.480
 quick turn of the tower and if more 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:07.420
 help and turn the case 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:10.829
 Antoniades not spin firefly us 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.829
 this actually ends the pros 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:16.620
 and this fight comes to an end we look 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:19.180
 results and that very surprise 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:23.170
 dedicated to the brown menace as it is 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:26.220
 Sometimes thanks for watching likes 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:29.460
 subscribe to the channel for new meetings 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.460
 bye Bye
