00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:08.420
 in this first World Cup tournament from the 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.420
 usa currently in the lead 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.929
 elisabeth price 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.550
 but they indeed twice not to live 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.550
 start like vanessa ferrari 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.239
 So she will definitely be here 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.079
 not next to the double stretched in the 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.079
 second track 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.670
 always inventive gymnasts 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.820
 what in between pave the jump 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.990
 make everything magic on the floor 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.660
 he always clung a naturally 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.000
 little bit of the others too 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:37.380
 settle down and do your own thing 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.060
 just to stay in memory 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.070
 he shines after the last track of the 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.780
 double page is also great 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.370
 that was the one in the booth 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.660
 title defense the successful 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:51.760
 title defense difficult I think so 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.780
 the really really exciting so we 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:57.970
 call maybe once again the 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:59.620
 result of larissa dache 57 9 98 and 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.770
 although the rating comes back the 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:07.030
 look right to top total colon 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:10.330
 is there and you have to have more than 57 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:13.270
 99 8 then then would have rather 58th 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.770
 stand before that if she would win 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.890
 the gymnasts seems to be safe 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.890
 his 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.319
 well maybe you congratulate her here 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:28.040
 also first of all to the successful 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:30.170
 ground exercise the next to all the services 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:34.010
 actually top was from all 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:37.549
 Turnerinnen but it's about the first 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:40.840
 World Cup victory and it is about 15,000 euros 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:44.750
 Prize money double saloon with double screw 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:51.769
 this is the work for the later salary 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:54.220
 So then there is a 58 in front then 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:54.220
 Has 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:13.730
 Judges take a lot of time 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:18.020
 And there is the price 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:20.810
 wins the first World Cup tournament in 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:25.750
 this world cup season you are all sitting there 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:34.430
 eight gymnasts vanessa ferrari he 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:36.410
 ranked third he is really great 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.489
 that the gymnast is so tight 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.290
 lie together 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:41.600
 that just shows that again in the 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.750
 more fight then but each every little 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.130
 Fehlchen counts the first placed and 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.200
 the second place is not here 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.989
 a tenth apart and that at 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:54.040
 four devices with four ratings is 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:59.660
 of course great and Elizabeth Seitz 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:01.720
 remains seventh with 53 9 32 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.720
 Points
