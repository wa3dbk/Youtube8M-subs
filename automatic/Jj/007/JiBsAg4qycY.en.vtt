there's no question The Dispensing gun

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.420 
there's no question The Dispensing gun
takes<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.720> lot<00:01:09.930> of<00:01:09.960> hassles<00:01:10.530> out<00:01:10.710> of<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:10.950> mixing

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
takes a lot of hassles out of the mixing

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.149 
takes a lot of hassles out of the mixing
application<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.360> storage<00:01:12.750> processes<00:01:13.409> but

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
application and storage processes but

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.310 
application and storage processes but
paint<00:01:14.490> crews<00:01:14.760> also<00:01:15.090> really<00:01:15.630> like<00:01:15.810> how<00:01:16.049> easy

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
the fill bond works great I like the

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.180 
the fill bond works great I like the
consistency<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.630> it<00:01:21.840> spreads<00:01:22.590> good<00:01:22.830> fill

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190

you don't have to worry about going over
it<00:01:26.790> again<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:27.180> mean<00:01:27.450> he'd<00:01:27.630> go<00:01:27.780> over<00:01:27.930> multiple

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
it again I mean he'd go over multiple

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.050 
it again I mean he'd go over multiple
times<00:01:28.560> without<00:01:28.770> clumping<00:01:29.280> up<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.640> flaking

back to work and smooth it you also

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.779 
back to work and smooth it you also
shorten<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.229> downtime<00:02:04.770> between<00:02:04.979> application

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:05.789 
shorten the downtime between application

for<00:04:25.260> four<00:04:25.470> hours<00:04:25.500> maybe<00:04:26.190> the<00:04:26.490> top<00:04:26.730> will

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
for four hours maybe the top will

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.210 
for four hours maybe the top will
practically<00:04:28.200> down<00:04:28.380> with<00:04:28.560> aircraft<00:04:28.980> the

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
practically down with aircraft the

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.620 
practically down with aircraft the
consistency<00:04:30.060> of<00:04:30.090> good<00:04:30.390> and<00:04:31.790> it<00:04:32.790> cures<00:04:33.270> a<00:04:33.390> lot

product we be the next day that's a
positive<00:04:46.650> thing<00:04:46.950> for<00:04:47.310> me<00:04:47.430> because<00:04:47.550> it<00:04:47.820> cuts<00:04:47.970> my

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
positive thing for me because it cuts my

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.140 
positive thing for me because it cuts my
