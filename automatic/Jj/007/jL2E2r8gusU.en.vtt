everybody<00:00:14.610> on<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:14.820> internet<00:00:15.179> has<00:00:15.299> been

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
everybody on the internet has been

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.769 
everybody on the internet has been
speculating<00:00:16.109> how<00:00:16.230> fast<00:00:16.650> is<00:00:17.010> this<00:00:17.250> engine<00:00:17.779> in

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
speculating how fast is this engine in

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.410 
speculating how fast is this engine in
practice<00:00:19.350> because<00:00:20.340> there's<00:00:20.609> no<00:00:20.789> horsepower

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
practice because there's no horsepower

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.990 
practice because there's no horsepower
indication<00:00:22.109> of<00:00:22.230> this<00:00:22.410> engine<00:00:22.830> I<00:00:23.160> would<00:00:23.789> say

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
indication of this engine I would say

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.460 
indication of this engine I would say
the<00:00:24.210> horsepower<00:00:24.630> maybe<00:00:25.939> 0.72<00:00:26.970> maybe<00:00:27.420> max<00:00:28.109> two

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
the horsepower maybe 0.72 maybe max two

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.659 
the horsepower maybe 0.72 maybe max two
holes<00:00:28.859> powers<00:00:29.310> but<00:00:30.590> it<00:00:31.590> actually<00:00:32.009> works<00:00:32.430> very

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
holes powers but it actually works very

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.090 
holes powers but it actually works very
well<00:00:32.790> if<00:00:33.410> it's<00:00:34.410> fast<00:00:34.920> enough<00:00:35.280> we<00:00:36.030> are<00:00:36.920> having<00:00:37.920> a

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
well if it's fast enough we are having a

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.760 
well if it's fast enough we are having a
speed<00:00:38.399> of<00:00:38.550> about<00:00:38.700> 5<00:00:39.239> to<00:00:39.270> 6<00:00:39.690> kilometers<00:00:40.530> per

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
speed of about 5 to 6 kilometers per

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.810 
speed of about 5 to 6 kilometers per
hour<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:42.200> it's<00:00:43.200> really<00:00:43.800> quiet<00:00:44.100> you<00:00:44.399> can<00:00:44.520> talk

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
hour and it's really quiet you can talk

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.600 
hour and it's really quiet you can talk
in<00:00:45.809> this<00:00:45.989> inflatable<00:00:46.829> boat<00:00:47.010> we<00:00:47.219> actually

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
in this inflatable boat we actually

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.470 
in this inflatable boat we actually
using<00:00:48.090> now<00:00:48.239> we<00:00:48.300> are<00:00:48.629> two<00:00:49.110> persons<00:00:49.559> in<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.860> boat

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
using now we are two persons in the boat

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.630 
using now we are two persons in the boat
this<00:00:51.480> is<00:00:51.660> pier<00:00:52.050> which<00:00:52.590> is<00:00:52.800> driving<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.489> boat

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
this is pier which is driving the boat

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.869 
this is pier which is driving the boat
right<00:00:53.699> now<00:00:54.590> and<00:00:55.590> as<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:55.949> can<00:00:56.070> see<00:00:56.129> we<00:00:56.699> can

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
right now and as you can see we can

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.459 
right now and as you can see we can
speak<00:00:57.239> freely<00:00:59.210> there's<00:01:00.210> no<00:01:00.539> engine<00:01:00.960> noise<00:01:01.170> at

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
speak freely there's no engine noise at

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.800 
speak freely there's no engine noise at
all<00:01:02.480> and<00:01:03.480> we<00:01:03.660> have<00:01:03.780> been<00:01:04.019> using<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:05.479> 75<00:01:06.479> in

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
all and we have been using the 75 in

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.460 
all and we have been using the 75 in
power<00:01:07.140> our<00:01:07.409> memory<00:01:08.369> about<00:01:09.330> one<00:01:09.630> hour<00:01:09.840> now<00:01:10.140> at

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
power our memory about one hour now at

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.219 
power our memory about one hour now at
full<00:01:10.830> speed<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:12.119> there's<00:01:12.630> no<00:01:12.780> indication

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
full speed and there's no indication

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.800 
full speed and there's no indication
that<00:01:13.439> in<00:01:13.770> this<00:01:13.920> if<00:01:14.310> -<00:01:14.640> right<00:01:14.970> now<00:01:15.180> I<00:01:15.210> was<00:01:15.600> think

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
that in this if - right now I was think

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.440 
that in this if - right now I was think
we<00:01:15.900> can<00:01:16.080> go<00:01:16.799> for<00:01:17.040> another<00:01:17.220> hour<00:01:17.490> before<00:01:18.030> it's

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
we can go for another hour before it's

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.060 
we can go for another hour before it's
empty

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
empty

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.390 
empty
so<00:01:20.070> this<00:01:20.280> is<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.460> really<00:01:22.070> really<00:01:23.070> nice

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
so this is a really really nice

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.700 
so this is a really really nice
experience<00:01:23.880> we<00:01:24.479> have<00:01:24.630> been<00:01:24.840> speaking<00:01:25.229> all<00:01:25.530> the

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
experience we have been speaking all the

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.950 
experience we have been speaking all the
time<00:01:25.979> this<00:01:26.549> is<00:01:26.610> new<00:01:27.000> in<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.390> small<00:01:27.720> boat<00:01:27.930> like

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
time this is new in a small boat like

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.700 
time this is new in a small boat like
this<00:01:28.290> if<00:01:28.979> you<00:01:29.189> use<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.549> petrol<00:01:29.909> engine<00:01:30.680> make<00:01:31.680> a

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
this if you use the petrol engine make a

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.550 
this if you use the petrol engine make a
lot<00:01:31.950> of<00:01:31.979> noise<00:01:32.750> as<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:33.840> can<00:01:33.990> see<00:01:34.170> we<00:01:34.380> have<00:01:34.530> a

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
lot of noise as you can see we have a

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.980 
lot of noise as you can see we have a
state<00:01:34.950> of<00:01:35.070> speed

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
state of speed

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.810 
state of speed
and<00:01:37.990> it's<00:01:38.140> so<00:01:38.380> quiet<00:01:38.710> and<00:01:38.979> nice<00:01:39.159> this<00:01:40.149> is<00:01:40.360> a

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
and it's so quiet and nice this is a

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.740 
and it's so quiet and nice this is a
something<00:01:42.820> I<00:01:43.090> would<00:01:45.030> say<00:01:46.030> many<00:01:46.240> people<00:01:46.330> should

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
something I would say many people should

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.240 
something I would say many people should
drive<00:01:47.159> this<00:01:48.159> is<00:01:48.369> the<00:01:48.820> situation<00:01:50.100> it's<00:01:51.100> also

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
drive this is the situation it's also

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.219 
drive this is the situation it's also
called<00:01:51.610> Shakespeare<00:01:52.210> I<00:01:53.909> think<00:01:54.909> you<00:01:54.970> should

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
called Shakespeare I think you should

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:02.899 
called Shakespeare I think you should
have<00:01:56.229> fur<00:01:56.560> tries<00:01:56.950> not<00:01:57.429> very<00:01:57.729> expensive<00:01:58.179> engine

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.969 

and<00:02:03.909> is<00:02:04.030> there<00:02:04.240> very<00:02:04.420> easily<00:02:04.810> setup<00:02:05.259> just<00:02:05.619> have

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
and is there very easily setup just have

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.919 
and is there very easily setup just have
to<00:02:06.130> put<00:02:06.369> the<00:02:07.319> battery<00:02:08.319> on<00:02:08.619> and<00:02:09.340> just<00:02:09.750> flip<00:02:10.750> on

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
to put the battery on and just flip on

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:16.220 
to put the battery on and just flip on
the<00:02:11.970> cables<00:02:12.970> to<00:02:13.840> the<00:02:14.019> legend<00:02:14.860> weights<00:02:15.130> maybe

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
the cables to the legend weights maybe

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.309 
the cables to the legend weights maybe
about<00:02:17.230> one<00:02:17.950> little<00:02:18.130> yellow<00:02:18.340> tip<00:02:19.060> kilos<00:02:19.480> the

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
about one little yellow tip kilos the

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.400 
about one little yellow tip kilos the
bear<00:02:20.530> battery<00:02:20.980> that's<00:02:21.310> about<00:02:21.640> 18<00:02:22.120> kilos<00:02:22.480> then

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
bear battery that's about 18 kilos then

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.340 
bear battery that's about 18 kilos then
you<00:02:23.560> are<00:02:23.739> running<00:02:24.030> so<00:02:25.030> easy<00:02:25.269> and<00:02:26.110> it's<00:02:26.260> so

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
you are running so easy and it's so

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.940 
you are running so easy and it's so
quiet<00:02:26.709> and<00:02:27.540> it<00:02:28.540> seems<00:02:28.870> like<00:02:29.170> the<00:02:29.500> engine

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
quiet and it seems like the engine

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
quiet and it seems like the engine
really<00:02:30.700> performs<00:02:31.330> very<00:02:31.600> well<00:02:31.720> on<00:02:32.640> where<00:02:33.640> wins

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
really performs very well on where wins

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.180 
really performs very well on where wins
a<00:02:34.180> lot<00:02:34.390> of<00:02:34.510> people<00:02:34.810> in<00:02:34.900> the<00:02:35.049> burbs<00:02:35.260> it<00:02:35.799> actually

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
a lot of people in the burbs it actually

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.150 
a lot of people in the burbs it actually
performs<00:02:36.670> just<00:02:36.700> as<00:02:37.000> well<00:02:37.060> it's<00:02:37.540> about<00:02:37.810> 4<00:02:38.620> to<00:02:38.920> 6

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
performs just as well it's about 4 to 6

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.630 
performs just as well it's about 4 to 6
