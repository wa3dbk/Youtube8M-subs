00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.930
 we are going to integrate immediately what 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.850
 that revealed a study about a plant 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:32.360
 that helps to fight diabetes seems 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:34.190
 a company always custom all 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:39.739
 on Tuesdays and we're talking about one 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:42.380
 I would think it strange , however, if 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.720
 it really is the fundi what happens is 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.280
 that there was a study at a university 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.500
 again 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.320
 where was a small study for 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.630
 check if love really had the 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.120
 effects what 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:58.180
 for many years tell him he has to 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.710
 hypoglycemic effects to reduce the 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.500
 glucose in the blood had 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:05.080
 exact ancestors then that was done 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.750
 study and it definitely turned out that if 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.540
 in humans but then a university 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.910
 in Japan decided to do it in animals 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:16.030
 to then be able to determine in a 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:19.030
 way better it turned out that they tried it on 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.500
 the juice of the fruit you know that the kun 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.880
 of love has a fruit for not 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.490
 damage what was the fruit 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.860
 and children but they play has and I know 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:30.580
 They also eat those who most enjoy 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:33.460
 that fruit is the home in truth is the 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:36.580
 hummingbird so they enjoy 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.040
 the fundi love it turns out that the leaves 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.890
 in you 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.630
 the 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:46.790
 the raw fruit and the cooked fruit are 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.670
 Then they gave the extract so that the 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.830
 animals will use it of course 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.800
 it induced them to get on their glucose 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:57.229
 and others and it turned out that definitely in 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.880
 the three forms will not have 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.380
 how it works in that aspect that what 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.200
 makes specific what is really the 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:06.800
 theory of these scientists is that 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.170
 nourishes the pancreas and allows the 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.090
 beta cells that are the cells that 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.060
 they help produce insulin 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.700
 allows to produce more insulin then 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.070
 but these studies the clarification is that 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.989
 was done on patients in the study who 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.730
 it was done in india it was done in patients of 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.620
 type 2 diabetes so they are not 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.980
 dependent insulin 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.739
 definitely now, it's already coming to 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.950
 port rich in extract comes in powder 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:35.180
 the kun of love and good in capsules of 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.710
 way to make a small fruit by 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.060
 the amount of change 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.740
 it was enough for the verÃ­n of this 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.660
 way so it simplifies everything if 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.940
 definitely now it's 500 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.040
 we milled the capsule but the studies 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:49.520
 They were made with 1,000 milligrams or be 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.250
 that the person is of average weight 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.050
 You can use two capsules a day to 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.970
 Once they touch it for water, we do not prevent it 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.580
 be divided in the morning and in the night 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.910
 so the fundi love we know it's a 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.860
 creeper and that is achieved in form 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.870
 wild and you can definitely 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.660
 take the leaf preferably the most 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.730
 the youngest but also a 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.610
 code that is called true then then 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.230
 he puts the water to boil and 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.720
 when the water is boiling it is left 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.870
 to fall the leaf is covered the fire is extinguished 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.670
 and then it is taken is taken little by little 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.770
 there are people who like to eat 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.960
 fruit but you also have to be careful 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.670
 because sometimes it goes down a little bit because it does not 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.980
 there is control as such of the amount of 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:34.010
 Seattle now gives a warning is that 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.720
 the thing the only warning is that 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.160
 the person who uses we can not 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.130
 be pregnant 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.860
 in effect it has two proteins that make 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.750
 that the person can abort or that 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.120
 the pregnant woman should not use a let's say 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.680
 but the rest of the 300 that are 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.690
 diabetics of course they are in 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.520
 control with your doctor can use it 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.120
 and they inform their doctor that they are 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.120
 using
