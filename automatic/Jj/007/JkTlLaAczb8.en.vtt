wow<00:01:42.240> that's<00:01:42.570> that's<00:01:43.020> quite<00:01:43.200> fast<00:01:43.500> em<00:01:43.649> yeah

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
wow that's that's quite fast em yeah

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.289 
wow that's that's quite fast em yeah
it's<00:01:44.040> coming<00:01:44.250> along<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.670> realistic

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
it's coming along and realistic

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.359 
it's coming along and realistic
what<00:01:45.899> is<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.079> capex<00:01:46.320> for<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.590> project<00:01:47.040> it's<00:01:47.280> a

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
what is the capex for the project it's a

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.819 
what is the capex for the project it's a
big<00:01:47.549> capex<00:01:47.970> 750<00:01:48.630> million<00:01:48.810> dollars<00:01:49.259> but<00:01:49.710> we're

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
big capex 750 million dollars but we're

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.920 
big capex 750 million dollars but we're
well<00:01:49.979> on<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.130> way<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.340> funding<00:01:50.790> that<00:01:50.909> if<00:01:51.630> you

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
well on the way to funding that if you

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.109 
well on the way to funding that if you
look<00:01:52.079> at<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.290> gold<00:01:52.500> production<00:01:53.009> per<00:01:53.340> amount

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
look at the gold production per amount

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.649 
look at the gold production per amount
of<00:01:54.240> capex<00:01:54.600> it's<00:01:55.110> quite<00:01:55.470> low<00:01:56.390> during<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.479> first

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
of capex it's quite low during the first

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.090 
of capex it's quite low during the first
ten<00:01:57.899> years<00:01:57.930> of<00:01:58.229> mine<00:01:58.380> production<00:01:58.680> we<00:01:59.070> will

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
ten years of mine production we will

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.480 
ten years of mine production we will
average<00:01:59.869> 497<00:02:00.869> thousand<00:02:01.380> ounces<00:02:01.680> of<00:02:01.950> gold<00:02:02.219> per

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
average 497 thousand ounces of gold per

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.760 
average 497 thousand ounces of gold per
year<00:02:02.729> uh<00:02:02.909> not<00:02:03.270> at<00:02:03.719> first<00:02:03.960> eight<00:02:04.140> years<00:02:04.170> over

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
year uh not at first eight years over

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.319 
year uh not at first eight years over
five<00:02:05.009> hundred<00:02:05.040> thousand<00:02:05.640> ounces<00:02:05.729> of<00:02:05.939> gold<00:02:06.149> per

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
five hundred thousand ounces of gold per

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.180 
five hundred thousand ounces of gold per
year<00:02:06.509> so<00:02:06.810> for<00:02:06.990> seven<00:02:07.259> or<00:02:07.350> $50,000,000

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
year so for seven or $50,000,000

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.460 
year so for seven or $50,000,000
so<00:02:08.729> you<00:02:08.849> get<00:02:08.970> a<00:02:09.000> lot<00:02:09.209> of<00:02:09.330> gold<00:02:09.479> production<00:02:10.080> if

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
so you get a lot of gold production if

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.350 
so you get a lot of gold production if
it<00:02:10.590> ends<00:02:10.830> of<00:02:10.950> an<00:02:11.129> additional<00:02:11.520> cost

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
it ends of an additional cost

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.480 
it ends of an additional cost
we<00:02:12.840> do<00:02:12.960> get<00:02:13.140> sober<00:02:13.380> but<00:02:13.530> it<00:02:13.980> truly<00:02:14.370> is<00:02:14.460> a

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
we do get sober but it truly is a

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.220 
we do get sober but it truly is a
goldmine<00:02:14.880> perhaps<00:02:15.420> when<00:02:15.690> we're<00:02:15.810> producing

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
goldmine perhaps when we're producing

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.550 
goldmine perhaps when we're producing
roughly<00:02:16.530> 500<00:02:17.190> thousand<00:02:17.490> ounces<00:02:17.640> of<00:02:17.850> gold

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
roughly 500 thousand ounces of gold

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.110 
roughly 500 thousand ounces of gold
silver<00:02:19.560> is<00:02:19.830> maybe<00:02:20.160> three<00:02:20.430> hundred<00:02:20.700> thousand

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
silver is maybe three hundred thousand

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.860 
silver is maybe three hundred thousand
mmm<00:02:24.920> fantastic<00:02:26.030> well<00:02:27.030> that<00:02:27.180> sounds<00:02:27.450> like<00:02:27.600> very

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
mmm fantastic well that sounds like very

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.930 
mmm fantastic well that sounds like very
robust<00:02:28.470> economics<00:02:29.010> because<00:02:29.130> she<00:02:29.340> said<00:02:29.490> eleven

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
robust economics because she said eleven

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.340 
robust economics because she said eleven
hundred<00:02:30.060> you<00:02:30.330> know<00:02:30.360> I<00:02:30.450> think<00:02:30.510> I<00:02:30.690> said<00:02:30.870> fifteen

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
hundred you know I think I said fifteen

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.070 
hundred you know I think I said fifteen
dollars<00:02:31.740> for<00:02:31.920> the<00:02:32.310> silver<00:02:32.670> we<00:02:33.330> are<00:02:33.360> today<00:02:33.690> at

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
dollars for the silver we are today at

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.020 
dollars for the silver we are today at
eleven<00:02:34.500> sixty<00:02:34.890> eight<00:02:35.010> and<00:02:35.040> probably<00:02:35.640> sixteen

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
eleven sixty eight and probably sixteen

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.730 
eleven sixty eight and probably sixteen
dollars<00:02:36.300> silver<00:02:36.510> so<00:02:36.600> we<00:02:36.720> are<00:02:36.840> quite<00:02:37.110> close<00:02:37.410> of

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
dollars silver so we are quite close of

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.920 
dollars silver so we are quite close of
course<00:02:37.950> but<00:02:38.370> I<00:02:38.400> think<00:02:38.700> we<00:02:39.300> are<00:02:39.420> going<00:02:39.660> up<00:02:39.750> in

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
course but I think we are going up in

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.750 
course but I think we are going up in
the<00:02:40.020> next<00:02:40.290> year<00:02:40.470> so<00:02:40.560> there's<00:02:41.160> a<00:02:41.220> lot<00:02:41.340> of<00:02:41.430> upside

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
the next year so there's a lot of upside

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.410 
the next year so there's a lot of upside
then<00:02:42.500> we<00:02:43.500> are<00:02:43.950> very<00:02:44.220> if<00:02:44.520> gold<00:02:44.760> stays<00:02:45.090> where<00:02:45.330> it

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
then we are very if gold stays where it

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.470 
then we are very if gold stays where it
is<00:02:45.560> this<00:02:46.560> project<00:02:47.130> will<00:02:47.340> make<00:02:47.850> a<00:02:47.910> lot<00:02:48.150> of<00:02:48.180> money

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
is this project will make a lot of money

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.390 
is this project will make a lot of money
and<00:02:48.630> kick<00:02:48.810> off<00:02:48.960> a<00:02:48.990> lot<00:02:49.230> of<00:02:49.320> cash<00:02:49.530> that<00:02:50.010> if<00:02:50.160> gold

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
and kick off a lot of cash that if gold

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.220 
and kick off a lot of cash that if gold
goes<00:02:50.490> up<00:02:50.880> it's<00:02:51.060> only<00:02:51.210> better<00:02:51.510> yeah<00:02:51.960> yeah

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
goes up it's only better yeah yeah

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.970 
goes up it's only better yeah yeah
absolutely

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
absolutely

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.560 
absolutely
um<00:02:53.930> some<00:02:54.930> of<00:02:55.080> the<00:02:55.320> yeah<00:02:55.680> let's<00:02:55.980> say<00:02:56.360> the<00:02:57.360> major

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
um some of the yeah let's say the major

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.990 
um some of the yeah let's say the major
targets<00:02:58.200> you<00:02:58.290> want<00:02:58.470> to<00:02:58.560> achieve<00:02:58.880> 2015<00:02:59.880> now

2015 what they want the stones for 2015

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.800 
2015 what they want the stones for 2015
are<00:03:06.960> first<00:03:07.680> of<00:03:07.800> all<00:03:08.180> have<00:03:09.180> our<00:03:09.330> permits<00:03:09.570> in

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
are first of all have our permits in

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.500 
are first of all have our permits in
hand<00:03:10.020> late<00:03:10.290> March<00:03:10.590> early<00:03:10.920> April<00:03:11.390> during<00:03:12.390> that

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
hand late March early April during that

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.540 
hand late March early April during that
period<00:03:12.780> we'll<00:03:13.110> line<00:03:13.290> up<00:03:13.320> our<00:03:13.530> financing<00:03:14.190> to

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
period we'll line up our financing to

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.370 
period we'll line up our financing to
build<00:03:14.670> a<00:03:14.820> mind<00:03:15.000> critical<00:03:15.480> path<00:03:15.630> is<00:03:15.900> permitting

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
build a mind critical path is permitting

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.050 
build a mind critical path is permitting
so<00:03:17.010> while<00:03:17.190> we're<00:03:17.370> getting<00:03:17.580> the<00:03:17.640> permitting

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
so while we're getting the permitting

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.030 
so while we're getting the permitting
done<00:03:18.209> we<00:03:18.570> will<00:03:18.720> we<00:03:19.200> will<00:03:19.230> line<00:03:19.800> up<00:03:19.830> our

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
done we will we will line up our

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.729 
done we will we will line up our
financing<00:03:20.640> and<00:03:20.820> also<00:03:21.360> get<00:03:21.840> way<00:03:22.020> ahead<00:03:22.140> of<00:03:22.290> the

financing and also get way ahead of the
curve<00:03:22.770> on<00:03:23.190> engineering<00:03:23.790> that's<00:03:24.390> what<00:03:24.600> we'll

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
curve on engineering that's what we'll

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.090 
curve on engineering that's what we'll
be<00:03:24.810> doing<00:03:24.959> up<00:03:25.200> until<00:03:25.290> the<00:03:25.560> permits<00:03:25.890> are<00:03:26.010> issued

be doing up until the permits are issued

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.160 
be doing up until the permits are issued
once<00:03:26.730> the<00:03:26.850> permits<00:03:27.180> are<00:03:27.300> issued<00:03:27.390> we're

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
once the permits are issued we're
