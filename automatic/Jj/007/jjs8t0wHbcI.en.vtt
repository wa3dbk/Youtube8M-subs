00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
it's for el84 that was kind of done as a

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:46.620 
it's for el84 that was kind of done as a
request<00:01:44.319> from<00:01:44.470> Mark<00:01:44.709> Knopfler<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:46.270> I<00:01:46.479> also

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
request from Mark Knopfler and I also

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.419 
request from Mark Knopfler and I also
have<00:01:46.899> my<00:01:47.049> Sonoma<00:01:47.440> which<00:01:47.679> is<00:01:47.799> my<00:01:47.950> dumb<00:01:48.130> belief

style<00:01:48.700> anthem<00:01:49.119> so<00:01:49.270> I<00:01:50.520> guess<00:01:51.520> that's<00:01:51.729> kind<00:01:51.940> of

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
style anthem so I guess that's kind of

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.839 
style anthem so I guess that's kind of
the<00:01:52.119> new<00:01:52.240> stuff<00:01:52.539> so<00:01:53.190> ok<00:01:54.190> the<00:01:54.340> amp<00:01:54.459> he's<00:01:54.670> going

00:01:54.839 --> 00:01:54.849 
the new stuff so ok the amp he's going

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:58.229 
the new stuff so ok the amp he's going
to<00:01:54.910> be<00:01:55.030> playing<00:01:55.239> through<00:01:55.390> is<00:01:55.539> my<00:01:55.690> sh<00:01:56.050> g<00:01:57.030> it's<00:01:58.030> a

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:58.239 
to be playing through is my sh g it's a

00:01:58.239 --> 00:02:00.479 
to be playing through is my sh g it's a
very<00:01:58.569> high<00:01:58.810> gain<00:01:58.869> amp<00:01:59.470> but<00:01:59.739> it<00:01:59.860> doesn't<00:02:00.190> do<00:02:00.310> the

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:00.489 
very high gain amp but it doesn't do the

00:02:00.489 --> 00:02:02.460 
very high gain amp but it doesn't do the
high<00:02:00.670> gain<00:02:00.910> scoop<00:02:01.390> thing<00:02:01.660> it<00:02:01.810> still<00:02:02.080> sounds

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
high gain scoop thing it still sounds

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:03.930 
high gain scoop thing it still sounds
like<00:02:02.500> a<00:02:02.649> vintage<00:02:02.920> marshall<00:02:03.489> but<00:02:03.610> it's<00:02:03.759> got<00:02:03.910> a

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
like a vintage marshall but it's got a

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.719 
like a vintage marshall but it's got a
ridiculous<00:02:04.509> amount<00:02:04.660> of<00:02:04.869> gain<00:02:05.080> I<00:02:05.649> kind<00:02:06.550> of<00:02:06.610> was

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
ridiculous amount of gain I kind of was

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:08.249 
ridiculous amount of gain I kind of was
going<00:02:06.910> for<00:02:07.030> the<00:02:07.149> 80s<00:02:07.420> hair<00:02:07.629> metal<00:02:07.660> without

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
going for the 80s hair metal without

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:09.779 
going for the 80s hair metal without
having<00:02:08.530> to<00:02:08.590> use<00:02:08.709> a<00:02:08.739> pedal<00:02:09.099> thing<00:02:09.280> I<00:02:09.429> just<00:02:09.640> like

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
having to use a pedal thing I just like

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.670 
having to use a pedal thing I just like
the<00:02:09.940> old<00:02:10.060> high<00:02:10.300> gain<00:02:10.539> marshall<00:02:11.019> so<00:02:11.170> that's<00:02:11.379> I

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
the old high gain marshall so that's I

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.380 
the old high gain marshall so that's I
guess<00:02:12.340> that's<00:02:12.550> kind<00:02:12.610> of<00:02:12.790> what<00:02:12.940> it<00:02:13.060> is<00:02:13.090> it's

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
guess that's kind of what it is it's

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.809 
guess that's kind of what it is it's
it's<00:02:13.599> v<00:02:13.989> gain<00:02:14.290> stages<00:02:14.860> so<00:02:15.129> it's<00:02:15.250> it's<00:02:15.519> got<00:02:15.790> a

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
it's v gain stages so it's it's got a

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.759 
it's v gain stages so it's it's got a
lot<00:02:16.180> of<00:02:16.209> gain<00:02:16.540> but<00:02:16.780> it<00:02:16.870> still<00:02:17.140> retains<00:02:17.349> a<00:02:17.739> lot

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769 
lot of gain but it still retains a lot

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:20.520 
lot of gain but it still retains a lot
of<00:02:17.950> old-school<00:02:18.849> feel<00:02:19.420> and<00:02:19.720> style<00:02:19.989> and<00:02:20.290> tones

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
of old-school feel and style and tones

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.710 
of old-school feel and style and tones
so<00:02:20.980> well<00:02:21.610> and<00:02:21.760> what<00:02:21.940> are<00:02:21.970> you<00:02:22.120> have<00:02:22.480> in<00:02:22.599> the

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
so well and what are you have in the

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.809 
so well and what are you have in the
cabinet<00:02:23.010> there<00:02:24.010> are<00:02:24.099> two<00:02:24.220> speakers<00:02:24.610> that<00:02:24.760> are

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
cabinet there are two speakers that are

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.000
