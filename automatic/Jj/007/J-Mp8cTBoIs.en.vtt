think what it is I'm going to go through

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.070 
think what it is I'm going to go through
it<00:00:22.310> once<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:23.609> then<00:00:24.359> you<00:00:24.510> can<00:00:24.660> just<00:00:24.810> kind<00:00:24.960> of

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
it once and then you can just kind of

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.109 
it once and then you can just kind of
you<00:00:25.590> know<00:00:25.650> rewind<00:00:26.160> fast-forward<00:00:26.580> whatever<00:00:27.060> it

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
it's not the actual guitar apart from

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.319 
it's not the actual guitar apart from
the<00:00:58.800> song<00:00:59.010> in<00:00:59.250> fact<00:00:59.489> I<00:00:59.640> kind<00:00:59.820> of<00:00:59.910> use<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.030> hybrid

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
the song in fact I kind of use a hybrid

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.280 
the song in fact I kind of use a hybrid
of<00:01:00.629> of<00:01:01.020> that<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:02.239> a<00:01:03.239> lot<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.899> keyboard

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
of of that and a lot of the keyboard

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.080 
of of that and a lot of the keyboard
chords<00:01:04.559> or<00:01:04.890> at<00:01:05.250> least<00:01:05.400> what<00:01:05.549> I<00:01:05.580> hear<00:01:05.909> in<00:01:06.000> the

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
chords or at least what I hear in the

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.700 
chords or at least what I hear in the
keyboard<00:01:06.450> chords<00:01:06.750> that<00:01:07.080> kind<00:01:07.320> of<00:01:07.350> make<00:01:07.500> up<00:01:07.619> the

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
keyboard chords that kind of make up the

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.789 
keyboard chords that kind of make up the
melody<00:01:08.010> of<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.220> song<00:01:09.350> the<00:01:10.350> other<00:01:10.409> thing<00:01:10.680> I've

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
melody of the song the other thing I've

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.440 
melody of the song the other thing I've
noticed<00:01:11.430> I've<00:01:11.549> been<00:01:11.580> playing<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:12.000> recently

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
noticed I've been playing it recently

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.270 
noticed I've been playing it recently
and<00:01:12.810> that<00:01:13.200> is<00:01:13.350> I<00:01:13.439> actually<00:01:13.590> played<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:13.979> little

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
and that is I actually played a little

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.710 
and that is I actually played a little
bit<00:01:14.490> differently<00:01:14.850> like<00:01:15.000> I<00:01:15.150> used<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.390> little<00:01:15.540> bit

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
bit differently like I used a little bit

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.300 
bit differently like I used a little bit
different<00:01:16.200> finger<00:01:16.470> picking<00:01:16.710> patterns<00:01:17.100> and

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
different finger picking patterns and

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.460 
different finger picking patterns and
when<00:01:18.030> I<00:01:18.060> actually<00:01:18.270> recorded<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:18.900> video<00:01:19.200> but

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
when I actually recorded that video but

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.240 
when I actually recorded that video but
I<00:01:19.530> guess<00:01:19.710> that's<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:19.920> way<00:01:20.040> these<00:01:20.189> things

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
I guess that's the way these things

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.740 
I guess that's the way these things
evolve<00:01:21.590> anyway<00:01:22.590> so<00:01:23.100> uh<00:01:23.130> why<00:01:23.970> we<00:01:24.119> get<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:24.600> and

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
evolve anyway so uh why we get to it and

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.929 
evolve anyway so uh why we get to it and
start<00:01:25.409> off<00:01:25.530> with<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.860> first<00:01:26.369> major<00:01:26.490> section

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
start off with the first major section

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.910 
start off with the first major section
of<00:01:27.030> chords<00:01:27.390> which<00:01:27.570> is<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.869> intros<00:01:28.290> intro

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
of chords which is the intros intro

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.830 
of chords which is the intros intro
section<00:01:29.159> we'll<00:01:29.820> go<00:01:29.939> we'll<00:01:30.360> just<00:01:30.390> go<00:01:30.600> quickly

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
section we'll go we'll just go quickly

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.319 
section we'll go we'll just go quickly
past<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.610> you<00:01:32.610> know<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.850> frit<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.150> first

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
past the you know the frit the first

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.440 
past the you know the frit the first
opening<00:01:33.600> couple<00:01:33.900> of<00:01:33.960> notes<00:01:34.140> which<00:01:34.350> is<00:01:34.530> just

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
opening couple of notes which is just

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:43.030 
opening couple of notes which is just
it's<00:01:36.450> just<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.750> G<00:01:37.320> sharp<00:01:37.700> to<00:01:38.700> an<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:39.950> to<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:40.979> B<00:01:41.220> so

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
it's just the G sharp to an a to a B so

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.130 
it's just the G sharp to an a to a B so
from<00:01:44.040> there<00:01:44.340> it<00:01:44.640> goes<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:44.970> it's<00:01:45.450> basically<00:01:45.869> an

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
from there it goes to it's basically an

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:57.609 
from there it goes to it's basically an
A<00:01:46.759> and<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:48.570> D<00:01:48.750> at<00:01:48.899> 9<00:01:50.840> so

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.130 

that<00:01:58.619> is<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.100> major<00:01:59.460> 9th<00:01:59.759> chord<00:02:00.110> without<00:02:01.110> a

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
that is a a major 9th chord without a

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.120 
that is a a major 9th chord without a
third<00:02:01.469> so<00:02:02.250> it's<00:02:02.549> it's<00:02:02.880> a<00:02:03.210> D<00:02:03.630> at<00:02:03.810> 9:00<00:02:04.079> to<00:02:04.590> a<00:02:04.619> back

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
third so it's it's a D at 9:00 to a back

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.850 
third so it's it's a D at 9:00 to a back

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
now if you find that particular version

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.090 
now if you find that particular version
of<00:04:30.880> a<00:04:30.970> D<00:04:31.090> major<00:04:31.270> seven<00:04:31.720> more<00:04:32.320> difficult<00:04:32.980> you

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
of a D major seven more difficult you

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.890 
of a D major seven more difficult you
can<00:04:33.370> go<00:04:33.550> just<00:04:33.640> go<00:04:33.820> with<00:04:34.030> the<00:04:34.210> three<00:04:34.600> fingers

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
can go just go with the three fingers

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:52.860 
can go just go with the three fingers
like<00:04:34.990> this<00:04:35.170> so<00:04:35.350> though<00:04:50.340> that<00:04:51.340> part<00:04:51.720> in<00:04:52.720> the

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
like this so though that part in the

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.770 
like this so though that part in the
next<00:04:53.080> part<00:04:53.260> it<00:04:53.350> goes<00:04:53.470> from<00:04:53.710> a<00:04:53.800> benign<00:04:54.600> to<00:04:55.600> an<00:04:55.690> e

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
next part it goes from a benign to an e

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:03.460 
next part it goes from a benign to an e
7<00:04:57.000> back<00:04:58.000> to<00:04:58.180> a<00:04:58.210> benign

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.470 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.780 

remember<00:05:04.470> we<00:05:04.590> talked<00:05:04.800> about<00:05:04.919> the<00:05:05.160> e7<00:05:05.520> before

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:05.790 
remember we talked about the e7 before

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:08.060 
remember we talked about the e7 before
which<00:05:05.970> is<00:05:06.000> this<00:05:06.660> in<00:05:07.290> the<00:05:07.380> previous<00:05:07.740> section

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
which is this in the previous section

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:09.950 
which is this in the previous section
but<00:05:08.310> now<00:05:08.430> I'm<00:05:08.550> just<00:05:08.730> adding<00:05:08.880> them<00:05:09.060> I'm<00:05:09.600> adding

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
but now I'm just adding them I'm adding

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.870 
but now I'm just adding them I'm adding
the<00:05:10.199> be<00:05:11.190> on<00:05:11.550> the<00:05:11.970> root<00:05:13.160> it's<00:05:14.160> still<00:05:14.340> an<00:05:14.460> e7

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
the be on the root it's still an e7

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:30.560 
the be on the root it's still an e7
chord<00:05:23.000> 2097<00:05:24.000> back<00:05:24.330> to<00:05:24.510> be<00:05:24.630> 9<00:05:27.590> and<00:05:29.360> then<00:05:30.360> there's

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:30.570 
chord 2097 back to be 9 and then there's

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.659 
chord 2097 back to be 9 and then there's
the<00:05:30.750> run<00:05:30.960> up<00:05:31.110> heading<00:05:32.040> back<00:05:32.190> to<00:05:32.400> the<00:05:32.520> main

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:32.669 
the run up heading back to the main

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:36.469 
the run up heading back to the main
melody<00:05:32.880> again<00:05:33.180> and<00:05:33.600> it<00:05:33.690> starts<00:05:33.990> on<00:05:34.110> the<00:05:34.139> b9<00:05:35.479> to

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479 
melody again and it starts on the b9 to

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:38.930 
melody again and it starts on the b9 to
another<00:05:36.810> form<00:05:37.139> of<00:05:37.260> a<00:05:37.530> which<00:05:37.919> has<00:05:37.950> a<00:05:38.130> c-sharp<00:05:38.669> on

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:38.940 
another form of a which has a c-sharp on

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:48.379 
another form of a which has a c-sharp on
the<00:05:39.060> root<00:05:44.180> then<00:05:45.180> i<00:05:45.240> go<00:05:45.419> to<00:05:45.479> a<00:05:45.600> d<00:05:46.910> again<00:05:47.910> a<00:05:47.970> little

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:48.389 
the root then i go to a d again a little

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:50.780 
the root then i go to a d again a little
more<00:05:48.510> complicated<00:05:48.810> form<00:05:49.229> just<00:05:49.580> you<00:05:50.580> can<00:05:50.700> do

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:50.790 
more complicated form just you can do

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:54.170
