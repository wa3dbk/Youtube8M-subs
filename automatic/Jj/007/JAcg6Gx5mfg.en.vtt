woofer I placed it behind the computer
close<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.430> two<00:01:08.640> walls<00:01:08.940> as<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:09.360> can<00:01:09.509> see

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:09.660 
close to the two walls as you can see

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.740 
close to the two walls as you can see
from<00:01:09.899> the<00:01:09.990> different<00:01:10.350> colors<00:01:11.180> so<00:01:12.180> when<00:01:12.570> it's

from the different colors so when it's

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:20.270 
from the different colors so when it's
on<00:01:14.360> take<00:01:15.360> turn<00:01:15.840> it<00:01:16.020> off<00:01:18.140> okay<00:01:19.140> now<00:01:20.039> when<00:01:20.220> you

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.969 
connect the two satellite speakers wires
into<00:01:39.179> this<00:01:40.910> port<00:01:41.910> here<00:01:42.270> which<00:01:43.170> leads<00:01:43.530> into<00:01:43.770> the

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
into this port here which leads into the

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.870 
into this port here which leads into the
sub<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.550> then<00:01:44.910> you<00:01:45.899> plug<00:01:46.200> in<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.530> power<00:01:46.880> is

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
sub and then you plug in the power is

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.380 
sub and then you plug in the power is
going<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.179> be<00:01:48.330> here<00:01:48.660> down<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.580> power<00:01:50.880> cord

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
going to be here down to the power cord

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:59.870 
going to be here down to the power cord
