00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
so something I've always wanted to work

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.050 
so something I've always wanted to work
on<00:00:03.689> was<00:00:04.170> trying<00:00:04.529> to<00:00:04.710> figure<00:00:04.859> out<00:00:05.040> a<00:00:05.069> way<00:00:05.190> to<00:00:05.640> rig

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
on was trying to figure out a way to rig

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.980 
on was trying to figure out a way to rig
a<00:00:06.270> pole<00:00:06.660> start<00:00:07.080> or<00:00:07.379> a<00:00:07.440> manual<00:00:07.919> start<00:00:08.960> without<00:00:09.960> a

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
a pole start or a manual start without a

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.780 
a pole start or a manual start without a
recoil<00:00:10.559> on<00:00:10.830> to<00:00:11.580> a<00:00:11.990> large<00:00:12.990> Briggs<00:00:13.590> engine<00:00:14.130> that

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
recoil on to a large Briggs engine that

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.840 
recoil on to a large Briggs engine that
typically<00:00:15.179> needs<00:00:15.570> an<00:00:16.410> electric<00:00:16.890> starter<00:00:17.279> to

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
typically needs an electric starter to

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.790 
typically needs an electric starter to
fire<00:00:18.060> so<00:00:18.750> that's<00:00:18.840> what<00:00:19.020> I'd<00:00:19.199> actually<00:00:19.500> cut<00:00:19.619> out

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
fire so that's what I'd actually cut out

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.260 
fire so that's what I'd actually cut out
your<00:00:20.010> doing<00:00:20.279> today<00:00:20.430> I've<00:00:20.760> been<00:00:20.850> toying<00:00:21.060> around

your<00:01:09.750> motor<00:01:09.930> here's<00:01:10.740> what<00:01:10.950> I've<00:01:11.100> done<00:01:11.369> this<00:01:11.880> is

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
your motor here's what I've done this is

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.200 
your motor here's what I've done this is
actually<00:01:12.720> an<00:01:12.810> idler<00:01:13.200> pulley<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.520> mower<00:01:14.880> deck

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
actually an idler pulley to a mower deck

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.140 
actually an idler pulley to a mower deck
on<00:01:15.420> like<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:16.049> craftsman<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:16.979> I<00:01:17.580> mean<00:01:17.790> I'll<00:01:17.970> our

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
on like a craftsman and I mean I'll our

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.940 
on like a craftsman and I mean I'll our
poly<00:01:18.330> because<00:01:18.780> it's<00:01:19.080> not<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.259> spindle<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:19.830> can

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
poly because it's not a spindle you can

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.890 
poly because it's not a spindle you can
actually<00:01:20.100> see<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.670> still<00:01:21.030> has<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.570> idler

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
actually see it still has the idler

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.340 
actually see it still has the idler
bearing<00:01:22.259> built<00:01:22.500> into<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:23.009> right<00:01:23.159> there<00:01:24.350> the

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
bearing built into it right there the

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.289 
bearing built into it right there the
only<00:01:25.560> thing<00:01:25.740> I<00:01:25.830> did<00:01:26.040> to<00:01:26.220> it<00:01:26.340> was<00:01:26.640> drill<00:01:26.939> three

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
only thing I did to it was drill three

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.620 
only thing I did to it was drill three
holes<00:01:27.330> in<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:27.930> I<00:01:28.140> used<00:01:28.979> this<00:01:29.579> plastic<00:01:30.150> piece<00:01:30.390> as

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
holes in it I used this plastic piece as

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.499 
holes in it I used this plastic piece as
a<00:01:30.659> template<00:01:31.140> I<00:01:31.409> laid<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.340> down<00:01:32.369> on<00:01:32.820> top<00:01:33.240> of<00:01:33.390> my

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
a template I laid it down on top of my

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.330 
a template I laid it down on top of my
pulley<00:01:33.780> you<00:01:34.320> got<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.560> get<00:01:34.650> it<00:01:34.740> as<00:01:34.829> centered<00:01:35.009> as

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
pulley you got to get it as centered as

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.819 
pulley you got to get it as centered as
you<00:01:35.460> possibly<00:01:36.030> can<00:01:36.329> measure<00:01:36.659> or<00:01:37.110> whatever

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
you possibly can measure or whatever

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.469 
you possibly can measure or whatever
you've<00:01:37.979> got<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.189> do<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:38.700> then<00:01:39.180> mark<00:01:39.420> your

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
you've got to do and then mark your

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.240 
you've got to do and then mark your
three<00:01:39.810> holes<00:01:40.049> pull<00:01:40.560> this<00:01:40.650> thing<00:01:40.890> back<00:01:41.040> off

three holes pull this thing back off

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.190 
three holes pull this thing back off
drill<00:01:41.610> your<00:01:41.759> three<00:01:42.000> holes<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.570> then<00:01:42.869> put<00:01:43.110> the

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
drill your three holes and then put the

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.370 
drill your three holes and then put the
pulley<00:01:43.409> down<00:01:43.680> on<00:01:43.950> top<00:01:44.220> of<00:01:44.430> that<00:01:44.579> triangular

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
pulley down on top of that triangular

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.899 
pulley down on top of that triangular
metal<00:01:46.380> thing<00:01:46.619> on<00:01:46.740> top<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:47.070> your<00:01:47.189> flywheel<00:01:47.430> and

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
metal thing on top of your flywheel and

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.030 
metal thing on top of your flywheel and
run<00:01:48.479> your<00:01:48.600> Torx<00:01:48.899> screws<00:01:49.229> right<00:01:49.619> back<00:01:49.829> down

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
run your Torx screws right back down

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.950 
run your Torx screws right back down
through<00:01:50.340> your<00:01:50.579> new<00:01:50.729> holes<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.540> other<00:01:51.689> thing

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
through your new holes the other thing

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.510 
through your new holes the other thing
you're<00:01:52.079> also<00:01:52.259> going<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.680> have<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:53.100> do<00:01:53.250> is

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
you're also going to have to do is

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.789 
you're also going to have to do is
create<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.509> little<00:01:54.780> notch<00:01:54.960> which<00:01:55.500> you<00:01:55.619> can

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
create a little notch which you can

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:56.840 
create a little notch which you can
actually<00:01:55.950> see<00:01:56.280> right<00:01:56.310> there

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
actually see right there

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.090 
actually see right there
and<00:01:56.939> it<00:01:57.750> doesn't<00:01:57.960> need<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.320> be<00:01:58.350> very<00:01:58.619> deep<00:01:58.890> in

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
and it doesn't need to be very deep in

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.740 
and it doesn't need to be very deep in
fact<00:01:59.280> you<00:01:59.490> don't<00:01:59.700> want<00:01:59.939> it<00:02:00.090> too<00:02:00.270> deep<00:02:00.479> because

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
fact you don't want it too deep because

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.359 
fact you don't want it too deep because
then<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.229> rope<00:02:01.409> won't<00:02:01.560> be<00:02:01.740> able<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:01.979> pull<00:02:02.189> out

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
then the rope won't be able to pull out

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.480 
then the rope won't be able to pull out
and<00:02:02.610> it<00:02:03.000> also<00:02:03.240> needs<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.350> be<00:02:04.439> a<00:02:04.710> directional

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
and it also needs to be a directional

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.670 
and it also needs to be a directional
notch<00:02:05.670> and<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.750> best<00:02:06.990> way<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.200> figure<00:02:07.590> out

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
notch and the best way to figure out

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.350 
notch and the best way to figure out
what<00:02:07.860> direction<00:02:07.979> you're<00:02:08.429> not<00:02:08.580> needs<00:02:08.879> to<00:02:08.940> go<00:02:09.149> in

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
what direction you're not needs to go in

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.910 
what direction you're not needs to go in
is<00:02:09.569> if<00:02:09.780> you're<00:02:09.929> standing<00:02:10.319> over<00:02:10.440> your<00:02:10.679> motor

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
is if you're standing over your motor

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.390 
is if you're standing over your motor
your<00:02:11.640> motor<00:02:11.910> typically<00:02:12.510> spins

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
your motor typically spins

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.899 
your motor typically spins
clockwise<00:02:14.950> so<00:02:15.950> a<00:02:15.980> real<00:02:16.220> easy<00:02:16.370> way<00:02:16.640> to<00:02:16.700> figure

00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:16.909 
clockwise so a real easy way to figure

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:19.000 
clockwise so a real easy way to figure
this<00:02:17.030> out<00:02:17.330> is<00:02:17.569> basically<00:02:18.319> as<00:02:18.530> you're<00:02:18.739> spinning

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
this out is basically as you're spinning

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.759 
this out is basically as you're spinning
clockwise<00:02:19.730> you<00:02:20.510> basically<00:02:21.260> imagine<00:02:21.470> your

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
clockwise you basically imagine your

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:23.500 
clockwise you basically imagine your
finger<00:02:22.040> as<00:02:22.099> a<00:02:22.129> marker<00:02:22.519> and<00:02:22.700> you<00:02:23.090> will<00:02:23.239> want<00:02:23.420> to

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
finger as a marker and you will want to

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.190 
finger as a marker and you will want to
make<00:02:23.599> a<00:02:23.930> gouge<00:02:24.230> in<00:02:24.860> a<00:02:25.610> clockwise<00:02:26.269> spiral<00:02:26.930> sort

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
make a gouge in a clockwise spiral sort

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.660 
make a gouge in a clockwise spiral sort
of<00:02:27.290> motion<00:02:27.680> like<00:02:27.890> this<00:02:28.159> there's<00:02:28.489> a<00:02:28.549> little

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
of motion like this there's a little

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.539 
of motion like this there's a little
gouge<00:02:28.970> kind<00:02:29.390> of<00:02:29.480> a<00:02:29.569> spiral<00:02:30.140> formation<00:02:30.890> it's

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:31.549 
gouge kind of a spiral formation it's

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:34.360 
gouge kind of a spiral formation it's
hard<00:02:31.730> to<00:02:31.849> explain<00:02:32.200> but<00:02:33.200> it's<00:02:33.379> very<00:02:33.590> important

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
hard to explain but it's very important

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.520 
hard to explain but it's very important
that<00:02:34.430> you<00:02:34.730> have<00:02:34.760> that<00:02:35.599> you<00:02:36.019> cannot<00:02:36.290> have<00:02:36.500> a

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
that you have that you cannot have a

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.440 
that you have that you cannot have a
gouge<00:02:36.799> straight<00:02:37.220> up<00:02:37.310> and<00:02:37.459> down<00:02:37.489> it<00:02:37.819> has<00:02:38.060> to<00:02:38.239> be

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
gouge straight up and down it has to be

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.110 
gouge straight up and down it has to be
at<00:02:38.690> an<00:02:39.200> angle<00:02:39.530> like<00:02:39.560> that<00:02:39.760> and<00:02:40.760> here's<00:02:40.970> the

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
at an angle like that and here's the

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.030 
at an angle like that and here's the
reason<00:02:41.269> why<00:02:41.450> we're<00:02:42.379> going<00:02:42.470> to<00:02:42.530> put<00:02:42.709> a<00:02:42.739> knot<00:02:43.010> in

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
reason why we're going to put a knot in

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.610 
reason why we're going to put a knot in
this<00:02:43.459> rope<00:02:43.730> in<00:02:44.000> this<00:02:44.329> pull<00:02:44.569> rope<00:02:44.810> and<00:02:45.049> when

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
this rope in this pull rope and when

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.369 
this rope in this pull rope and when
this<00:02:45.799> thing<00:02:46.069> spins<00:02:46.940> around<00:02:47.090> and<00:02:47.599> the<00:02:48.200> motor

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:48.379 
this thing spins around and the motor

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:50.380 
this thing spins around and the motor
starts<00:02:48.739> to<00:02:48.890> run<00:02:49.069> this<00:02:49.609> needs<00:02:49.910> to<00:02:50.090> release

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
starts to run this needs to release

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.240 
starts to run this needs to release
instantly<00:02:51.049> if<00:02:51.530> this<00:02:51.769> is<00:02:51.920> a<00:02:51.950> straight

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
instantly if this is a straight

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.430 
instantly if this is a straight
up-and-down<00:02:52.430> knotch<00:02:52.879> this<00:02:53.780> thing<00:02:54.049> can<00:02:54.230> rip

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
up-and-down knotch this thing can rip

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.440 
up-and-down knotch this thing can rip
the<00:02:54.920> pull<00:02:55.129> cord<00:02:55.400> right<00:02:55.609> out<00:02:55.760> of<00:02:55.879> your<00:02:56.000> hands

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
the pull cord right out of your hands

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.119 
the pull cord right out of your hands
staying<00:02:57.170> attached<00:02:57.530> to<00:02:57.769> the<00:02:57.859> motor<00:02:58.040> and

00:02:58.119 --> 00:02:58.129 
staying attached to the motor and

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:00.250 
staying attached to the motor and
basically<00:02:58.579> creating<00:02:59.090> a<00:02:59.269> centrifugal<00:02:59.810> pull

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
basically creating a centrifugal pull

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.530 
basically creating a centrifugal pull
starting<00:03:00.620> cord<00:03:00.890> of<00:03:01.129> terror<00:03:01.549> but<00:03:02.120> as<00:03:02.239> you<00:03:02.420> can

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
starting cord of terror but as you can

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.630 
starting cord of terror but as you can
see<00:03:02.599> I've<00:03:02.989> obviously<00:03:03.140> got<00:03:03.470> mine<00:03:03.829> screwed<00:03:04.459> down

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
see I've obviously got mine screwed down

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.000 
see I've obviously got mine screwed down
and<00:03:04.940> mostly<00:03:05.239> in<00:03:05.390> place<00:03:05.659> I<00:03:05.930> have<00:03:06.230> not<00:03:06.440> tested<00:03:06.680> it

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
and mostly in place I have not tested it

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.920 
and mostly in place I have not tested it
yet<00:03:07.159> as<00:03:07.340> you<00:03:07.489> can<00:03:07.640> see<00:03:07.879> because<00:03:08.269> I<00:03:08.359> do<00:03:08.420> not<00:03:08.720> have

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
yet as you can see because I do not have

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.470 
yet as you can see because I do not have
the<00:03:09.170> fan<00:03:09.409> shroud<00:03:09.620> in<00:03:09.920> place<00:03:10.190> so<00:03:11.000> I'm<00:03:11.120> going<00:03:11.359> to

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
the fan shroud in place so I'm going to

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.030 
the fan shroud in place so I'm going to
put<00:03:11.629> all<00:03:11.810> that<00:03:11.840> back<00:03:12.260> together<00:03:12.470> right<00:03:12.829> now

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
put all that back together right now

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.000 
put all that back together right now
I've<00:03:13.340> got<00:03:14.209> my<00:03:14.239> pull<00:03:14.599> cord<00:03:14.900> right<00:03:15.379> here<00:03:15.440> and

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
I've got my pull cord right here and

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.809 
I've got my pull cord right here and
this<00:03:16.849> thing<00:03:17.090> is<00:03:17.269> dead<00:03:17.599> cold<00:03:18.200> dead<00:03:19.130> cold<00:03:19.519> see

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:19.819 
this thing is dead cold dead cold see

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:21.699 
this thing is dead cold dead cold see
I'm<00:03:19.910> touching<00:03:20.209> the<00:03:20.299> exhaust<00:03:20.630> the<00:03:20.989> head<00:03:21.230> this

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
basically going to do here is you tie a

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.539 
basically going to do here is you tie a
knot<00:03:44.959> in<00:03:45.019> the<00:03:45.169> end<00:03:45.260> of<00:03:45.410> your<00:03:45.560> pull<00:03:46.099> cord<00:03:46.340> rope

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
knot in the end of your pull cord rope

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:48.280 
knot in the end of your pull cord rope
and<00:03:47.209> you<00:03:47.299> don't<00:03:47.449> want<00:03:47.569> your<00:03:47.690> pull<00:03:47.840> cord<00:03:48.109> rope

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
and you don't want your pull cord rope

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.020 
and you don't want your pull cord rope
too<00:03:48.470> long<00:03:48.709> I'd<00:03:48.949> say<00:03:49.129> 2<00:03:49.190> feet<00:03:49.579> is<00:03:49.699> probably<00:03:49.970> a

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
too long I'd say 2 feet is probably a

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.140 
too long I'd say 2 feet is probably a
maximum<00:03:50.949> but<00:03:51.949> you'll<00:03:52.069> put<00:03:52.190> your<00:03:52.310> cord<00:03:52.609> in<00:03:52.790> your

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
maximum but you'll put your cord in your

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.629 
maximum but you'll put your cord in your
knot<00:03:53.329> on<00:03:53.540> the<00:03:53.690> top<00:03:53.930> and<00:03:54.260> then<00:03:55.010> basically<00:03:55.370> take

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:55.639 
knot on the top and then basically take

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:58.210 
knot on the top and then basically take
your<00:03:55.760> cord<00:03:56.090> and<00:03:56.329> wrap<00:03:56.629> it<00:03:56.780> around<00:03:56.900> this<00:03:57.859> whole

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
your cord and wrap it around this whole

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.420 
your cord and wrap it around this whole
thing<00:03:58.519> here<00:03:59.949> double<00:04:00.949> check<00:04:01.129> to<00:04:01.250> make<00:04:01.280> sure

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
thing here double check to make sure

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:02.680 
thing here double check to make sure
I've<00:04:01.639> done<00:04:01.849> this<00:04:01.970> right<00:04:02.150> because<00:04:02.299> it's<00:04:02.510> hard

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
I've done this right because it's hard

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.750 
I've done this right because it's hard
to<00:04:02.780> see<00:04:02.930> on<00:04:03.049> camera<00:04:03.079> so<00:04:03.949> what<00:04:04.099> you<00:04:04.220> do<00:04:04.400> is<00:04:04.579> make

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
to see on camera so what you do is make

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.039 
to see on camera so what you do is make
sure<00:04:04.790> all<00:04:04.970> your<00:04:05.180> safety<00:04:05.389> switches<00:04:05.780> are<00:04:06.019> on

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:06.049 
sure all your safety switches are on

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:08.229 
sure all your safety switches are on
your<00:04:06.410> fuel<00:04:06.709> your<00:04:07.129> clutch<00:04:07.430> and<00:04:07.910> your<00:04:08.000> brakes

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 
your fuel your clutch and your brakes

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:10.119 
your fuel your clutch and your brakes
and<00:04:08.510> everything<00:04:08.900> and<00:04:09.109> give<00:04:09.680> this<00:04:09.829> thing<00:04:10.069> a

00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:10.129 
and everything and give this thing a

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:12.670 
and everything and give this thing a
really<00:04:10.430> good<00:04:10.669> pull<00:04:11.049> which<00:04:12.049> I<00:04:12.260> can't<00:04:12.500> do<00:04:12.650> with

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
really good pull which I can't do with

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.439 
really good pull which I can't do with
one<00:04:12.980> hand<00:04:13.220> obviously<00:04:13.730> with<00:04:13.879> Cameron<00:04:14.180> Mahan

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:14.449 
one hand obviously with Cameron Mahan

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:16.099 
but let's give this thing a try and see

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:18.039 
but let's give this thing a try and see
how<00:04:16.130> she<00:04:16.280> fires<00:04:16.609> alright<00:04:17.510> so<00:04:17.630> I<00:04:17.660> got<00:04:17.810> the<00:04:17.900> Rope

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
wrapped around there I got it choked

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.969 
wrapped around there I got it choked
right<00:04:20.180> up<00:04:20.389> and<00:04:21.260> you<00:04:21.320> give<00:04:21.500> this<00:04:21.590> thing<00:04:21.739> a<00:04:21.829> damn

00:04:25.280 --> 00:05:00.140 
doesn't rip the cord out of my hand and
kill<00:04:25.550> me

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.570 

there<00:05:01.150> you<00:05:01.240> go<00:05:01.360> guys<00:05:01.570> you<00:05:02.020> can<00:05:02.140> see<00:05:02.290> it<00:05:02.380> wasn't

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
there you go guys you can see it wasn't

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.520 
there you go guys you can see it wasn't
perfectly<00:05:03.580> centered<00:05:04.150> but<00:05:05.020> it's<00:05:05.170> enough<00:05:05.500> that

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
perfectly centered but it's enough that

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.080 
perfectly centered but it's enough that
it's<00:05:05.860> not<00:05:05.920> going<00:05:06.220> to<00:05:06.280> fly<00:05:06.490> off<00:05:06.700> of<00:05:06.730> there<00:05:07.000> and

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
it's not going to fly off of there and

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.300 
it's not going to fly off of there and
kill<00:05:07.330> someone<00:05:07.830> the<00:05:08.830> other<00:05:08.860> thing<00:05:09.190> you

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
kill someone the other thing you

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:10.770 
kill someone the other thing you
probably<00:05:09.670> want<00:05:09.880> to<00:05:09.940> make<00:05:10.000> sure<00:05:10.120> of<00:05:10.360> is<00:05:10.600> that

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
probably want to make sure of is that

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.290 
probably want to make sure of is that
you<00:05:10.870> leave<00:05:11.170> a<00:05:11.500> good<00:05:11.890> amount<00:05:12.310> of<00:05:12.490> area<00:05:12.940> in<00:05:13.090> here

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
you leave a good amount of area in here

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.320 
you leave a good amount of area in here
open<00:05:13.540> so<00:05:14.440> this<00:05:14.560> thing<00:05:14.800> can<00:05:14.950> still<00:05:15.250> get<00:05:15.400> air<00:05:15.760> but

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
open so this thing can still get air but

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.360 
open so this thing can still get air but
I'm<00:05:17.140> going<00:05:17.320> to<00:05:17.380> try<00:05:17.530> this<00:05:17.590> setup<00:05:17.920> for<00:05:18.010> a<00:05:18.190> little

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 
I'm going to try this setup for a little

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.760 
I'm going to try this setup for a little
while<00:05:18.490> see<00:05:18.790> how<00:05:18.820> it<00:05:19.030> works<00:05:19.210> I<00:05:19.570> like<00:05:20.320> the<00:05:20.530> fact

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
while see how it works I like the fact

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.740 
while see how it works I like the fact
that<00:05:20.890> I'm<00:05:21.070> not<00:05:21.220> stranded<00:05:21.910> and<00:05:22.180> relying

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750 
that I'm not stranded and relying

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.960 
that I'm not stranded and relying
completely<00:05:22.930> on<00:05:23.350> my<00:05:23.590> battery<00:05:24.040> say<00:05:24.400> my<00:05:24.580> battery

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:52.150 
much do it to any Briggs motor but uh

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:54.570 
much do it to any Briggs motor but uh
but<00:06:52.960> that's<00:06:53.050> it<00:06:53.290> for<00:06:53.440> today's<00:06:53.650> little<00:06:53.919> tip<00:06:54.340> and

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:54.580 
but that's it for today's little tip and

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:58.050 
but that's it for today's little tip and
