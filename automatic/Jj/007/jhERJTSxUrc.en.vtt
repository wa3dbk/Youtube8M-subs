00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:11.100
 hello today I would like to show 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:14.670
 how do we use the direct tissue so 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:16.710
 the fabric is white like the others 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.220
 tyvek but actually it's called fabric 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.169
 because he has a kind of armor that's 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.419
 to say that we see a kind of tram 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:24.869
 a little like threads on it 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:28.050
 below 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.970
 even if it's exactly like tibet 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.349
 which is always indecipherable and in 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.350
 anyway he has this aspect and then he is 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.980
 also much more flexible than Quebec 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.719
 same paper that the tibet fears so 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.949
 here are some uses that can be 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.289
 the same or different it really takes 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:45.660
 experienced and different textures so 

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:48.539
 here I paint them with bpo paint 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.100
 for fabrics I used chestnuts 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.890
 I made mixtures and then use 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.239
 a copper and in the collection of 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.039
 moirÃ© so that's what gives a little 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.039
 little the shiny side that you can 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.920
 see so engaged and I mixed 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.440
 many colors so what are we going 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.680
 do if so that's warm my 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:10.400
 tyvek which I do not use his hair 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.570
 but an agent who opens even more 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.670
 you can use a hair dryer or 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.550
 an iron protecting with 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.770
 parchment paper so less good 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.380
 heats a lot in it goes very fast 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.390
 react here we see that really very 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.550
 very quickly it cools do not go there 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:31.320
 too much either and that's the result 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:35.790
 so that narrowed the leaf that made 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.810
 hollow effects here so it's very 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.810
 well what I would like to do 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.780
 dead leaves with so really I 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.250
 will be able to use this texture you 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.420
 can always give a little help 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.580
 unless you find that it fits 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.900
 not what you want but it's worth 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.300
 better get there gradually because 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:54.260
 otherwise it can be very quickly will be reduced 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:57.540
 the size of a postage stamp 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:01.350
 so on this first piece I heated 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.880
 with an eagle or what to do with it on the 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.700
 above that is to say on the part that 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.350
 I was scared I would like to show you what 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.800
 what happens when we heat 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.550
 on the other side so on the non 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.650
 painted 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:18.650
 so that's exactly the same way 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.940
 with the same tool 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:26.879
 with me he mouths I go there by heating 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:29.300
 in the same way the reaction is very 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:29.300
 quick 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:44.489
 and now I have their tour 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:46.440
 to show you that's where you are 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:50.930
 see that in fact just now I had 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.930
 hollows and now I have bubbles 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.390
 here and on the back I was hollow so 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.459
 in fact according to the side where we 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.010
 heats the side where you heat you 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:04.860
 will always have volumes rather 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.230
 hollow and then on the other side here rather 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.530
 bubbles so it depends what you 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.900
 need me here for my leaves on 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:16.079
 hollow side like that is going to be fine 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.310
 because the species of two things 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:18.900
 who are the hottest are going to do it a 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:23.220
 little bit like it was veins 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:25.430
 so that fits well with what I 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.430
 want to do 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.650
 and here are my cut leaves 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.150
 I was inspired by the species of 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.190
 ribs that are created by heating 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.950
 to cut them out of which they have 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.110
 shapes a little weird but that's good 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.910
 still looks like leaves 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.050
 to note so it is always necessary first 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.970
 heat the tibet which is then 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.650
 cut out the fawns that you want if 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.850
 you do the opposite you risk 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.650
 to have tiny shapes that 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:54.020
 do not match what you are looking for 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.690
 so first have warm and then we 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:59.500
 cutting in ce1 ce1 according to the reasons 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.500
 created by the volume
