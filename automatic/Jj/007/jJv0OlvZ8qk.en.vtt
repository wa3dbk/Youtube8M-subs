Noctowl I was actually given this one a
long<00:02:41.730> time<00:02:41.790> ago<00:02:42.060> and<00:02:42.360> I<00:02:43.020> had<00:02:43.320> raised<00:02:43.560> it<00:02:43.740> myself

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
long time ago and I had raised it myself

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.800 
long time ago and I had raised it myself
pretty<00:02:44.670> high<00:02:44.820> so<00:02:45.060> this<00:02:45.180> one<00:02:45.330> actually<00:02:45.450> was

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
pretty high so this one actually was

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.260 
pretty high so this one actually was
raised<00:02:46.170> but<00:02:46.410> it's<00:02:46.560> at<00:02:46.680> a<00:02:46.709> pretty<00:02:47.040> high<00:02:47.100> level

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.250 
raised but it's at a pretty high level
the<00:02:48.270> reason<00:02:48.480> it<00:02:48.570> doesn't<00:02:48.690> have<00:02:48.870> a<00:02:48.900> move<00:02:49.080> here

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
the reason it doesn't have a move here

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.720 
the reason it doesn't have a move here
is<00:02:49.320> because<00:02:49.470> I<00:02:49.650> used<00:02:49.860> to<00:02:49.950> be<00:02:50.040> fly<00:02:50.280> I<00:02:50.520> just

that's why it was traded up like this

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.810 
that's why it was traded up like this
basically<00:03:46.500> the<00:03:46.769> exact<00:03:47.070> same<00:03:47.280> thing<00:03:47.519> is<00:03:47.640> that

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
basically the exact same thing is that

he<00:04:26.960> really<00:04:27.620> didn't<00:04:27.920> look<00:04:28.180> this<00:04:29.180> this<00:04:30.080> obvious

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
he really didn't look this this obvious

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.800 
he really didn't look this this obvious
before<00:04:31.070> other<00:04:31.430> than<00:04:31.700> the<00:04:31.820> blue<00:04:32.090> obviously<00:04:32.720> in

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
before other than the blue obviously in

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.320 
before other than the blue obviously in
the<00:04:32.900> ring<00:04:33.110> so<00:04:33.860> that's<00:04:34.340> a<00:04:34.520> really<00:04:34.550> nice<00:04:35.030> one<00:04:35.270> I

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
the ring so that's a really nice one I

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.300 
the ring so that's a really nice one I
really<00:04:35.510> liked<00:04:35.900> this<00:04:36.350> one<00:04:36.560> as<00:04:36.710> well<00:04:36.890> I<00:04:36.950> also

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
really liked this one as well I also

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.330 
really liked this one as well I also
fought<00:04:37.730> with<00:04:37.910> it<00:04:38.030> um<00:04:38.210> probably<00:04:39.020> new<00:04:39.560> surf<00:04:39.920> down

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
fought with it um probably new surf down

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.010 
fought with it um probably new surf down
here<00:04:40.670> which<00:04:40.940> is<00:04:41.060> why<00:04:41.180> it<00:04:41.240> is<00:04:41.360> missing<00:04:41.570> a<00:04:41.780> move

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
here which is why it is missing a move

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.410 
here which is why it is missing a move
so<00:04:42.740> this<00:04:43.220> is<00:04:43.340> going<00:04:43.580> to<00:04:43.670> be<00:04:43.730> a<00:04:43.760> really<00:04:44.150> cool<00:04:44.360> one

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:44.420 
so this is going to be a really cool one

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:48.670 
so this is going to be a really cool one
he's<00:04:44.660> on<00:04:44.810> level<00:04:44.960> 69<00:04:45.800> at<00:04:46.220> the<00:04:46.250> moment<00:04:47.410> the<00:04:48.410> top

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
he's on level 69 at the moment the top

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.460 
he's on level 69 at the moment the top
screen<00:04:49.070> he<00:04:49.880> is<00:04:50.120> oblivious<00:04:50.570> and<00:04:50.990> is<00:04:51.170> also

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
screen he is oblivious and is also

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.740 
screen he is oblivious and is also
neutral<00:04:52.280> so<00:04:52.400> that's<00:04:52.550> good<00:04:52.730> serious<00:04:53.450> takes

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750 
neutral so that's good serious takes

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.460 
neutral so that's good serious takes
plenty<00:04:54.050> of<00:04:54.290> siestas<00:04:54.970> so<00:04:55.970> that<00:04:56.150> is<00:04:56.300> another

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
plenty of siestas so that is another

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:01.450 
plenty of siestas so that is another
