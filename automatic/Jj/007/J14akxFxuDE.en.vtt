00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:15.090
 over 1800 spectators in the stuttgarter 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.880
 arena were already five minutes ago 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.380
 finish on for your tv askfeld too 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.750
 pretty high before the season 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.370
 traded ancient boys showed against the 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.890
 table leaders from emsdetten their to 

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:27.420
 dato best seasonal in attack 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.000
 The Swabians acted fluid and 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.510
 creatively behind him boarded jürgen müller 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.489
 the gate 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.469
 also in the second half could 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.070
 The keeper on his aggressive cover 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.879
 leave 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.109
 the early disturbed balls and intercepted 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:41.909
 tempo collisions opened the 

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:43.649
 Swabian defense stronghold had become 

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:46.469
 excellent on the replacement weakened 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.229
 but also little effective tv backspace 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.059
 set this kemper symbolic 

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:54.989
 for the bitterfield spielwitz in the 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:57.179
 offensive a sovereign 31 27 in the end 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.889
 after a long thirsty run so 

00:00:57.179 --> 00:01:01.289
 finally a reason to celebrate 

00:00:58.889 --> 00:01:02.729
 at home , of course, it is the goal in the 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.729
 team is still playing up 

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:07.350
 and printing out pressure we have 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.860
 Just not good handball shown in 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.990
 the last weeks it came like that 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.909
 just right for us that we are against 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.110
 top rider at home two points and 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.729
 I think that will give us back too 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.009
 but the next game was the 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.170
 Bergisch HC as the worst discovery 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.890
 Tracker in the second league table that 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.380
 exploit 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.570
 the task against henstedt much harder 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.549
 as thought because the frogs showed up 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.500
 team -manned fight-strong 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.869
 and also playfully 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.500
 accents the audience dared theirs 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.570
 hardly eyes 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.399
 because at half past two was against the ex 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.770
 federal leagues even more in it for 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:42.869
 the relegation candidates a three goals 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.250
 leadership shortly before the end then 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.530
 instead of then refuse the hands 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.140
 a little annoying against ripped lions 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.719
 the bhc prevented a shame thanks 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.479
 individual class 30 30 

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:56.070
 that actually meant point sharing 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.049
 a great result for the schleswig 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.479
 holsteiner and yet somehow 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.790
 a little annoying 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.560
 I think 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.720
 on the performance of or with the 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.780
 no one's performance today 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.250
 hide team can strengthen yes 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.780
 in the last games go the 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.120
 results of 29 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.150
 spielag bietigheim with a whole 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.830
 important away win in friesenheim 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.840
 askfeld proposes emsdetten the 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.580
 hüttenberger victory in aue is less 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.600
 surprised 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.780
 sensational turn the tie 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:29.270
 gain in henstedt eisenach saarlouis 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.220
 and rostock win at home as well 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.980
 like the hildesheimer the unexpected 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.600
 against nordhorn is seven in the table 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.660
 bietigheim the winner of the game day 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.940
 The Swabians jump on rank four 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.640
 then a tight midfield 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.560
 and below lose the three third league 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.070
 promoted by their defeats 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.070
 ground
