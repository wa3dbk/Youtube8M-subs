to make a quick video on how to operate

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.360 
to make a quick video on how to operate
this<00:00:15.570> tractor<00:00:15.990> so<00:00:16.139> I<00:00:16.200> don't<00:00:16.350> forget<00:00:16.470> anyway

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:17.370 
this tractor so I don't forget anyway

this tractor so I don't forget anyway
here<00:00:18.120> is<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:19.940> fuel<00:00:20.940> cutoff<00:00:21.270> valve<00:00:21.870> which<00:00:22.670> just

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
here is the fuel cutoff valve which just

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.930 
here is the fuel cutoff valve which just
turns<00:00:24.740> clockwise<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:26.220> counterclockwise<00:00:26.520> I

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:26.940 
turns clockwise and counterclockwise I

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.670 
turns clockwise and counterclockwise I
mean<00:00:27.240> while<00:00:27.420> you<00:00:27.600> unscrew<00:00:28.020> it<00:00:28.260> all<00:00:28.440> the<00:00:28.560> way

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
mean while you unscrew it all the way

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.080 
mean while you unscrew it all the way
out<00:00:29.300> to<00:00:30.300> make<00:00:30.510> sure<00:00:30.750> that<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.410> fuel<00:00:31.650> is

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
out to make sure that the fuel is

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:39.380 
out to make sure that the fuel is
available<00:00:36.110> and<00:00:37.110> then<00:00:37.880> basically<00:00:38.880> the<00:00:39.270> only

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
available and then basically the only

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.760 
available and then basically the only
other<00:00:39.630> thing<00:00:39.930> that's<00:00:40.680> what<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:40.950> key<00:00:42.650> where<00:00:43.650> is

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
other thing that's what the key where is

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.700 
other thing that's what the key where is
the<00:00:43.920> key<00:00:44.870> that's<00:00:45.870> what<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.110> key<00:00:46.260> looks<00:00:46.500> like

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
the key that's what the key looks like

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.500 
the key that's what the key looks like
it's<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:46.980> little<00:00:47.220> black<00:00:47.430> key<00:00:47.850> that's<00:00:48.210> on<00:00:48.360> the

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
it's a little black key that's on the

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.600 
it's a little black key that's on the
right<00:00:48.750> side<00:00:49.050> of<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.260> garage<00:00:49.470> door<00:00:49.890> hanging<00:00:50.400> up

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
right side of the garage door hanging up

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.000 
right side of the garage door hanging up
on<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.760> little<00:00:51.030> nail<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:53.989> the<00:00:54.989> throttle<00:00:55.530> is<00:00:55.739> all

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
on a little nail and the throttle is all

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.800 
on a little nail and the throttle is all
the<00:00:56.130> way<00:00:56.250> up<00:00:56.460> is<00:00:56.610> idle<00:00:57.360> slowest<00:00:57.989> speed<00:00:59.510> this<00:01:00.510> is

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:00.810 
the way up is idle slowest speed this is

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:05.719 
the way up is idle slowest speed this is
the<00:01:00.870> this<00:01:01.829> red<00:01:02.100> knob<00:01:02.310> is<00:01:02.610> the<00:01:02.850> fuel<00:01:03.199> cutoff<00:01:04.729> so

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
the this red knob is the fuel cutoff so

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.440 
the this red knob is the fuel cutoff so
to<00:01:06.570> turn<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.990> tractor<00:01:07.979> off<00:01:08.159> you<00:01:08.580> always<00:01:08.820> pull

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
to turn the tractor off you always pull

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.380 
to turn the tractor off you always pull
this<00:01:09.659> out<00:01:09.930> instead<00:01:10.409> of<00:01:10.470> turning<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.920> key<00:01:11.070> off

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
this out instead of turning the key off

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.710 
this out instead of turning the key off
so<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.450> crank<00:01:12.870> it<00:01:12.990> up<00:01:13.050> you<00:01:13.290> just<00:01:13.440> push<00:01:13.650> it<00:01:13.680> in

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
so to crank it up you just push it in

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.460 
so to crank it up you just push it in
this<00:01:15.720> lever<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.290> right<00:01:16.530> lever<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.159> high<00:01:18.470> low

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
this lever the right lever is a high low

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.940 
this lever the right lever is a high low
gear<00:01:20.130> which<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:21.380> explained<00:01:22.380> up<00:01:22.620> here<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:24.950> that

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
gear which is explained up here and that

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.130 
gear which is explained up here and that
has<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.310> be<00:01:26.430> in<00:01:26.520> neutral<00:01:28.670> I<00:01:29.840> believe<00:01:30.840> this<00:01:30.990> has

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
has to be in neutral I believe this has

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.420 
has to be in neutral I believe this has
to<00:01:31.290> be<00:01:31.380> in<00:01:31.470> neutral<00:01:31.860> in<00:01:31.979> order<00:01:32.190> for<00:01:32.340> the

to be in neutral in order for the

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.070 
to be in neutral in order for the
starter<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:32.909> engage<00:01:33.240> so<00:01:33.570> just<00:01:33.780> make<00:01:33.960> sure

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
starter to engage so just make sure

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.719 
starter to engage so just make sure
that's<00:01:34.229> in<00:01:34.440> neutral<00:01:34.830> and<00:01:34.950> then<00:01:35.580> of<00:01:35.700> course

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
that's in neutral and then of course

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.640 
that's in neutral and then of course
your<00:01:36.119> gears<00:01:36.690> are<00:01:37.020> there<00:01:38.210> these<00:01:39.210> levers<00:01:39.650> the

bush<00:02:08.159> hog<00:02:08.369> on<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.909> back<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.539> make<00:02:09.719> it<00:02:09.779> spin<00:02:10.700> and

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
bush hog on the back to make it spin and

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.129 
bush hog on the back to make it spin and
I<00:02:11.760> believe<00:02:12.060> that<00:02:12.090> you<00:02:12.329> pull<00:02:12.540> it<00:02:12.719> straight<00:02:12.930> back

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:13.139 
I believe that you pull it straight back

00:02:13.139 --> 00:02:14.090 
I believe that you pull it straight back
and<00:02:13.769> it

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
and it

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:23.360 
and it
we'll<00:02:14.190> engage<00:02:14.400> that<00:02:20.510> other<00:02:21.510> than<00:02:21.720> that<00:02:22.370> that's

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
we'll engage that other than that that's

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.720 
we'll engage that other than that that's
pretty<00:02:23.490> much<00:02:23.700> it<00:02:24.060> just<00:02:24.360> remember<00:02:24.780> to<00:02:25.490> when<00:02:26.490> you

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
pretty much it just remember to when you

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.900 
pretty much it just remember to when you
turn<00:02:27.030> it<00:02:27.210> off<00:02:27.390> to<00:02:28.220> pull<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.370> mixture<00:02:29.760> out

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
turn it off to pull the mixture out

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.900 
turn it off to pull the mixture out
first<00:02:30.740> then<00:02:31.740> turn<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.100> key<00:02:32.280> off<00:02:32.310> and<00:02:32.790> then

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
first then turn the key off and then

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.640 
first then turn the key off and then
when<00:02:33.120> we<00:02:33.240> shut<00:02:33.510> it<00:02:33.660> down<00:02:33.810> for<00:02:34.170> a<00:02:34.200> while<00:02:34.410> we're
