 galaxies gamer I hope you go 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:15.820
 well the scales in any case it's going very 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.080
 very well 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.619
 today guys we will find ourselves 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:23.110
 for another squat builder I'm going to you 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:24.310
 propose a friendly team and 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:27.369
 very complete and that I reassure you 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:30.910
 you when you cost about 170 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:32.140
 miles on xbox live and on psk I get 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.670
 remember more but do not worry 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:38.260
 will display on the screen worry 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:42.010
 not as I told you it's 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.829
 a small hybrid I do not have everything 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.170
 a hybrid do not brief there will be half 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.480
 rather a series and a half rather 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.730
 league 1 is really born gaza constitutes 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.340
 a very very strong team but before 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.559
 that I introduce you to this team if we 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.780
 could reach 40 young and gaza 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:01.359
 would be quite extraordinary and 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.180
 here we start right away with the 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:05.800
 liga goaltender for the goalkeeper i 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.940
 decided to put it going very very beautiful 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.980
 so 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.730
 nothing about this guardian he looks very very 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:15.310
 good guys really he made me a 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:17.740
 stops quite extraordinary 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.380
 knowing they're tall enough and he's measuring 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.170
 1 m 92 and the cedar and a chromatic this 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.760
 which makes me love every ski 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.370
 acrobatic one could see take the 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.320
 clips there he helped things all to 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.610
 make me quite extraordinary and 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.190
 this is you really recommend it is 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.290
 rather rather feature rather wind I 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.090
 know this good 84 years positioning 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.200
 bearded judged that positioning on this 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.680
 game is very important 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.720
 and here I urge you 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.310
 then then the roma for the first 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.080
 central defender david luiz so that's 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.660
 better for the trouble that I'm talking to you about 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.060
 this magnificent central defender it was 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.430
 a chelsea player heads 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.650
 unfortunately he went to paris 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.630
 holy germain but hey you know that 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:02.290
 change and unfair here it is always 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:04.240
 as strong is very good stadiums 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.670
 perfect for a central defender and 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.560
 you see that 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.110
 here he was also for the cases 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.310
 so much this 80 of the French reduced that 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.690
 you feel a little more at least one 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:19.290
 good 83 and here it is super good and then 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.340
 after in central right defender you 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.480
 decide to m kelly 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.980
 so who is not so in defense pardon 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.900
 I love him I love him 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.090
 he's too strong guys like we could 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.410
 see it I played the 67 part effect and 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.459
 I scored five goals and two assists 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.690
 decisive 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.370
 I did basile so it's rather 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.019
 a lot of money I scored five times 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.250
 for that little joke but really 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.350
 the guys who simply denies 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.019
 amazing really rock high school kids 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.000
 he is very very very very very strong in 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:47.459
 defense really exercise 87 in 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.590
 defense really feels a sound 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.390
 marking is quite incredible and 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.870
 his slipped tackles slip you 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.160
 on a utterly beautiful disappointment 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.410
 pretty much so that allowed me to put a 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.769
 basically a player who was a middle 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.660
 law 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:03.030
 but with its version one end but that 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.269
 becomes a detention of roy put himself 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.799
 steiner then in my opinion in my opinion it's 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.580
 one of the best defenders believe that 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:09.510
 you were only fire 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.390
 really she is simply 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.940
 amazing kids tired atlantico 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.950
 of match you do a good I think 87 in 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.690
 endurance so that's what makes it 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.670
 can not cover his presence 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.350
 be it at the neck him off also 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:26.850
 offensively speaking or defensively 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:28.739
 and we come and well represented in the 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.060
 gameplay and that's it I thought 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.830
 really and in 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.270
 the more they can buy it at age 31 there 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.790
 is currently a judgment it's a 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:38.250
 little more than 40 miles should rather 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.709
 assists and to finish this defense which 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:43.410
 20 meters a good little siqueira for that 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:45.720
 go he's pretty good I do not know he 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.000
 does not have extraordinary stats but a 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.590
 relay it's a left defender all or 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.950
 rather not bad and more 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.430
 staggering 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:55.230
 why is it all nice then 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.900
 so we unite and who rattle I'll 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.819
 put a good griezmann unfortunately 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.590
 I played five games so I had 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:02.670
 the opportunity to score only one goal 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.090
 had seen as can be seen on 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:09.630
 the screen but otherwise here I have rather 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.830
 liked beugré was very present 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.140
 offensively and that's it 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.959
 he has enough touch in god to create 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.459
 from any form of disturbance 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:19.380
 on the opposing defense and here I was 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.700
 really kiffed to death 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.190
 and then after that I said to myself 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.110
 am going to put a good matuidi who is very 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.120
 very defensive is very sturdy guys 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:31.620
 not lie to you and I tell you I could 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:39.690
 I enjoyed it is pretty good and that's it and 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:41.789
 with this town 60-70 good and amassed 76 in 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.460
 passes and dribbles however the little 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:47.160
 67 draws is quite low and behold 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.270
 we feel quickly that we want to try 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.580
 languages things with him it works 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:53.729
 not really so we'll finish this 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:56.340
 little French side and we will put a 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:59.039
 good karim benzema karim bezema really 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.660
 the idea wins everything put too loud I know 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:02.250
 not if you had the opportunity to test 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:05.240
 but me anyway I overcuffed the 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.240
 gains as we can see 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.289
 I bought 40 friends like me or men 

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:13.319
 a little cheaper I play with 8.35 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:15.389
 party I scored 38 goals and made 5 

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:17.639
 assists really karim benzema 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:18.899
 is quite incredible especially that 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:20.490
 the big ones and here are the yields they 

00:05:18.899 --> 00:05:22.649
 are pretty good I'm rather bompard 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:25.740
 whose karkwa technical gesture 80th bad 

00:05:22.649 --> 00:05:28.649
 piece is extraordinary for a start 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:31.169
 in addition it is fast and there is that 

00:05:28.649 --> 00:05:34.619
 a good 84 years draws it's pretty good 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:36.869
 so i'm going to put another french 

00:05:34.619 --> 00:05:38.059
 this is paul pogba guys the 

00:05:36.869 --> 00:05:40.169
 french hope 

00:05:38.059 --> 00:05:41.909
 he's coming too I adored you guys 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:42.899
 really there already loved it I scored 

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:44.249
 several languages things with him 

00:05:42.899 --> 00:05:46.819
 unfortunately I can not find the 

00:05:44.249 --> 00:05:50.550
 clips but here in prison 

00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:53.519
 it is a cheap version of cheaper 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:55.229
 yaya pardon rounded with a good 4 

00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:58.379
 just technical stars and 4.3 bad 

00:05:55.229 --> 00:06:00.240
 foot and that's it there's also this good 4th 8 in 

00:05:58.379 --> 00:06:02.039
 physical it really feels so I 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:06.179
 want more than 36 games I scored 17 

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:07.860
 goals 21 assists is there low 

00:06:06.179 --> 00:06:09.749
 I had put in another training in 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:11.279
 enamels know and I really found very 

00:06:09.749 --> 00:06:12.329
 effective damage especially because it has to 

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:14.339
 very good so wished a good 

00:06:12.329 --> 00:06:15.749
 very good shooting power even and 

00:06:14.339 --> 00:06:17.099
 here I found very very effective 

00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:18.749
 also like but of course for him m in 

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:20.249
 dc opening even if it changes nothing 

00:06:18.749 --> 00:06:22.949
 knowing that there are escaut his stats are 

00:06:20.249 --> 00:06:24.329
 very balanced and pretty much in a year 

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:27.599
 makes it better right I put a good 

00:06:24.329 --> 00:06:31.919
 cuadrado So the first time I 

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:33.180
 test on this fifa 15 me rather I know 

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:35.129
 not really I do not know I do not know 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.569
 if he disappointed me or rather typed but 

00:06:35.129 --> 00:06:38.490
 here I have sometimes I have not found very 

00:06:36.569 --> 00:06:40.889
 very effective even if been fast but 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:42.869
 that's what three-star sense bad foot 

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:44.459
 really feels like we want to shoot 

00:06:42.869 --> 00:06:46.810
 with his left foot because you 

00:06:44.459 --> 00:06:48.730
 see sometimes we want to 

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:50.290
 we want to enlist and unfortunately 

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:53.080
 he has that sempé check to enlist so 

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:55.030
 sometimes it feels fast but 

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:57.600
 otherwise I have scored a very nice goal 

00:06:55.030 --> 00:07:00.550
 with him when you could see him and 

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:02.980
 if it's new to this player 

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:04.180
 it's five-star technical gesture and 

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:04.600
 it's pretty good guys I 'm not going 

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:07.930
 lie to you 

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:09.790
 so here we are going to finish with another 

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:11.040
 attacker whom I completely adored 

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:14.110
 Guys, it's a monster 

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:15.010
 it is about carlos tevez all 

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:18.040
 simply magnificent 

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:19.570
 the only problem the only problem if he 

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:20.740
 had the four floors and signed four 

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:22.300
 weather bad foot its attacking cherry 

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:23.470
 perfect and unfortunately there is only 

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:25.990
 three for both domains 

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:31.030
 but if not the ja I really loved this 

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:34.180
 Gala 57 games played 49 goals and 25 25 

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:35.740
 incredible assists when you 

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:38.320
 see in this magnificent stadium a points 

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:40.990
 goal two cases with 85 general 86 years 

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:43.780
 speed 87 in dribbling 86 years 168 years 

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:45.310
 going on and a good 84 in physics in addition 

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:46.930
