00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:12.280
 welcome once more to mattek and today 

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:13.770
 I will teach you how to install whatsapp 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.960
 tiny on any computer 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:19.150
 really this is governed by three steps the 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.420
 first would be to install an emulator for 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:24.340
 to be able to use whatsapp and be able to 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.289
 install it later we will have to 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.810
 download whatsapp application on 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:32.500
 said emulator and finally as last 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:35.260
 step will follow the different options 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.570
 and measures to get to confirm 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.010
 our mobile phone in the application 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.440
 of whatsapp of the emulator that we have 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.180
 installed as a first step what 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.920
 we will have to do will be to click on the 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.570
 link that I leave in the description of 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.479
 emulator that you should download with 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.699
 point 2.2 and we will have to choose 

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:53.229
 the option that we like the most according to 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:55.120
 in our operating system the 

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:57.610
 computer in my case is windows so 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.769
 so much I downloaded the one that is 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.750
 on the left and subsequently 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:04.059
 we will have to wait a few seconds 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.940
 to which we are made of the download 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.640
 totally and when this happens what 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.140
 we will have to do will be to execute said 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.060
 for that program that we will have 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.040
 installed that is the emulator 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.079
 once executed what we have to 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.759
 make will wait about three seconds 

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:21.240
 until the emulator is completely 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:24.640
 actually downloaded this process usually 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.009
 occupy between 10 minutes between 10 and 15 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.329
 minutes already according to depends on the ram of 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:31.060
 each computer and the speed of 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:32.590
 connection and everything once the 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.270
 installation what we should do is to 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.789
 click on the search button the one that is 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.079
 top left it at that time 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:39.310
 what we have to do is look for the 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:41.439
 whatsapp application typing 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.000
 whatsapp in the search engine like no os 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:45.520
 no resulting application appears 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.140
 we will look for it in the play store a 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.340
 once punctured in it will be charged a 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.709
 lots of different applications of 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.030
 whatsapp since it is about the same 

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:53.679
 play store app that we 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.720
 are listed in our terminal in 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:57.220
 our smartphone once that's done 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.200
 what we have to do is click on 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.479
 whatsapp install it as if a 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.939
 normal application will be treated and wait for 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.890
 that is installed once installed what 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:07.990
 we must realize be the steps 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.060
 following to write the number of 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.349
 phone that we want to link with this 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.030
 emulator so we can use 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:15.130
 whatsapp with our account in our 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.599
 mobile phone and once done I'm 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.190
 following the steps in which to 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:20.290
 verify the number of what should be 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.049
 will make you send us a message 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.630
 direct or a sms in the normal or we 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:27.220
 will call with the verification code 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.750
 once we already know that code what 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.060
 we must do will be to write it to 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.550
 continuation for 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.440
 that accepts the accounts and permits and everything 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.870
 this that those that we usually click 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.640
 always and we can get to 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.430
 use whatsapp as if it were about 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.260
 our smartphone but in this case what 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.599
 What changes is that we are in 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.950
 our pc and good until there will be 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:49.420
