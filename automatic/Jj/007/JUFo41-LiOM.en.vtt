00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.170
 we are in 4 3 to 5 and we are in the chat 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.640
 and I do not have how it was answered and good 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:25.869
 let's see this game of what's going 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:29.030
 good in the tutorials for plants 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:35.770
 and weird and good things 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:35.770
 but that seems normal 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.830
 big 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.430
 in containers 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.670
 fair 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.110
 to define it 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.539
 well could I have to spend the 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.539
 level 4 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.000
 I do not understand what the three points are 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.000
 where I think you can improve people 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.560
 tutorial is not that I took off in 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.560
 home but good 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:56.049
 for this 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.649
 I could have enemies vary 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:58.649
 I would be pretty 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.440
 i 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:31.210
 well here the desert a thousand things now 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:36.390
 because even normal ones is not so much 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:36.390
 more I do not know I think it's the best there 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.830
 for me I hope to give in when 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:49.120
 just two women and this is decent 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.020
 it is playable at least 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:03:00.319
 entity 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:03:02.530
 better now than all 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:05.440
 what 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.770
 without any way of this prepared 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.480
 to go back to see where 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:14.550
 was 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.550
 hi girls 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.510
 I am very expert in metals 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:31.650
 that's ingenious and been to give 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.140
 complicated turns is worth so valuable 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:38.180
 pour portals on what it does 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:40.810
 where is the state is for that reason 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.810
 OK 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:51.280
 and well, well 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:03.400
 one 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.080
 two 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:14.150
 it seems easier to us than it is 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:14.150
 game 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:16.640
 these races
