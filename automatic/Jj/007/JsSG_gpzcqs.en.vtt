00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:13.030 
so this is the 805 I know I'm talking to
the<00:00:08.690> camera<00:00:09.550> we'll<00:00:10.550> get<00:00:10.790> there<00:00:11.140> 800<00:00:12.140> 5.6<00:00:12.920> a

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:13.040 
the camera we'll get there 800 5.6 a

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.660 
the camera we'll get there 800 5.6 a
this<00:00:13.460> is<00:00:13.610> the<00:00:13.760> first<00:00:14.710> major<00:00:15.710> telephoto<00:00:16.400> that's

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:16.670 
this is the first major telephoto that's

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:18.729 
this is the first major telephoto that's
got<00:00:16.910> an<00:00:17.060> electronic<00:00:17.539> aperture<00:00:17.869> in<00:00:18.140> it<00:00:18.259> that's

00:00:18.729 --> 00:00:18.739 
got an electronic aperture in it that's

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:21.729 
got an electronic aperture in it that's
only<00:00:18.949> found<00:00:19.249> in<00:00:19.640> the<00:00:19.820> two<00:00:20.329> chip<00:00:20.599> PCE<00:00:21.079> lenses

00:00:21.729 --> 00:00:21.739 
only found in the two chip PCE lenses

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:25.149 
only found in the two chip PCE lenses
this<00:00:22.310> one<00:00:22.609> also<00:00:23.390> has<00:00:23.599> a<00:00:23.989> flourite<00:00:24.649> element

00:00:25.149 --> 00:00:25.159 
this one also has a flourite element

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:28.300 
this one also has a flourite element
like<00:00:25.339> the<00:00:25.579> Canon<00:00:26.149> I<00:00:26.449> think<00:00:27.079> that<00:00:27.259> 70<00:00:28.009> to<00:00:28.130> 200

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 
like the Canon I think that 70 to 200

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:29.859 
like the Canon I think that 70 to 200
has<00:00:28.789> a<00:00:28.819> flourite<00:00:29.179> a<00:00:29.239> couple<00:00:29.630> of<00:00:29.720> their

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869 
has a flourite a couple of their

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:31.779 
has a flourite a couple of their
high-end<00:00:30.259> lenses<00:00:30.619> have<00:00:30.769> it<00:00:30.949> this<00:00:31.099> one<00:00:31.309> does<00:00:31.519> -

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:31.789 
high-end lenses have it this one does -

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:33.910 
high-end lenses have it this one does -
now<00:00:31.999> it's<00:00:32.570> not<00:00:32.780> until<00:00:33.050> you<00:00:33.200> realize<00:00:33.530> this

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
now it's not until you realize this

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.890 
now it's not until you realize this
little<00:00:34.490> thing<00:00:34.820> hanging<00:00:35.090> off<00:00:35.300> the<00:00:35.480> end<00:00:35.660> of<00:00:35.780> it

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:35.900 
little thing hanging off the end of it

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.470 
little thing hanging off the end of it
like<00:00:36.170> a<00:00:36.200> stag<00:00:36.710> beetle<00:00:36.740> is<00:00:37.280> actually<00:00:37.880> an<00:00:37.940> 800

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
like a stag beetle is actually an 800

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.900 
like a stag beetle is actually an 800
you<00:00:38.570> realize<00:00:38.870> how<00:00:39.230> enormous<00:00:40.010> this<00:00:40.460> thing<00:00:40.700> is

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
you realize how enormous this thing is

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.720 
you realize how enormous this thing is
now<00:00:41.570> this<00:00:41.750> is<00:00:41.990> one<00:00:42.320> of<00:00:42.470> only<00:00:42.560> two<00:00:42.950> in<00:00:42.980> the<00:00:43.190> probe

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
now this is one of only two in the probe

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.060 
now this is one of only two in the probe
lens<00:00:44.480> range<00:00:44.870> that<00:00:45.170> they've<00:00:45.320> announced<00:00:45.590> and

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
lens range that they've announced and

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.920 
lens range that they've announced and
are<00:00:46.250> exhibiting<00:00:46.670> for<00:00:46.820> the<00:00:46.880> first<00:00:47.090> time<00:00:47.300> at<00:00:47.510> CP

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
are exhibiting for the first time at CP

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.860 
are exhibiting for the first time at CP
plus<00:00:48.170> this<00:00:48.380> and<00:00:48.620> 18<00:00:49.520> to<00:00:49.670> 35<00:00:50.120> variable<00:00:50.600> aperture

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
plus this and 18 to 35 variable aperture

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.319 
plus this and 18 to 35 variable aperture
G<00:00:51.200> lens<00:00:51.470> and<00:00:52.100> this<00:00:52.610> is<00:00:52.760> the<00:00:52.850> only<00:00:53.000> one<00:00:53.180> where

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329 
G lens and this is the only one where

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:54.520 
G lens and this is the only one where
actually<00:00:53.570> they<00:00:53.660> had<00:00:53.780> to<00:00:53.900> take<00:00:54.050> test<00:00:54.290> shots

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
actually they had to take test shots

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.430 
actually they had to take test shots
with<00:00:54.740> so<00:00:55.040> let's<00:00:55.910> throw<00:00:56.510> a<00:00:56.540> card<00:00:56.870> in<00:00:57.050> this<00:00:57.200> guy

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
with so let's throw a card in this guy

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.500 
with so let's throw a card in this guy
and<00:00:57.710> see<00:00:58.160> how<00:00:58.370> it<00:00:58.490> does<00:00:59.320> no<00:01:00.320> excuses<00:01:00.850> the<00:01:01.850> d800

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
and see how it does no excuses the d800

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.359 
and see how it does no excuses the d800
is<00:01:02.540> fairly<00:01:02.810> unforgiving<00:01:03.729> so<00:01:05.200> I'd<00:01:06.200> notice<00:01:06.530> this

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
is fairly unforgiving so I'd notice this

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:09.190 
is fairly unforgiving so I'd notice this
is<00:01:07.579> a<00:01:07.609> viewing<00:01:08.179> platform<00:01:08.299> so<00:01:08.810> that's<00:01:08.990> to<00:01:09.109> be

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
is a viewing platform so that's to be

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.849 
is a viewing platform so that's to be
expected

00:01:09.849 --> 00:01:09.859 
expected

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:12.459 
expected
so<00:01:10.460> let's<00:01:10.670> take<00:01:11.030> a<00:01:11.090> few<00:01:11.479> test<00:01:11.780> shots<00:01:11.869> it's<00:01:12.259> hot

00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:12.469 
so let's take a few test shots it's hot

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:14.529 
so let's take a few test shots it's hot
really<00:01:13.039> easy<00:01:13.249> to<00:01:13.460> lose<00:01:13.609> yourself<00:01:14.090> with<00:01:14.210> a<00:01:14.240> lens

00:01:14.529 --> 00:01:14.539 
really easy to lose yourself with a lens

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:16.209 
really easy to lose yourself with a lens
like<00:01:14.689> this<00:01:14.840> and<00:01:15.229> I'll<00:01:15.350> be<00:01:15.469> able<00:01:15.590> to<00:01:15.740> find<00:01:15.979> where

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:16.219 
like this and I'll be able to find where

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:18.940 
like this and I'll be able to find where
you're<00:01:16.340> actually<00:01:16.729> shooting<00:01:17.439> let's<00:01:18.439> pick<00:01:18.799> out

let's pop it in and do some video tests

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:50.950 
let's pop it in and do some video tests
okay<00:01:46.159> so<00:01:46.219> we're<00:01:46.549> now<00:01:46.729> on<00:01:46.759> the<00:01:47.029> water

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.080 

using<00:01:51.960> my<00:01:52.110> while<00:01:52.350> a<00:01:52.380> somatic<00:01:52.860> system

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
using my while a somatic system

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.920 
using my while a somatic system
at<00:01:55.990> 5.6<00:01:56.829> and<00:01:57.250> obviously<00:01:57.640> and<00:01:58.000> I<00:01:58.090> can<00:01:58.329> reveal<00:01:58.630> to

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
at 5.6 and obviously and I can reveal to

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.100 
at 5.6 and obviously and I can reveal to
the<00:01:59.049> trial

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
the trial

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.840 
the trial
you<00:02:01.380> can<00:02:01.530> see<00:02:01.710> you<00:02:01.800> can<00:02:01.980> blow<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.460> background

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
you can see you can blow the background

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.800 
you can see you can blow the background
to<00:02:02.970> hell<00:02:03.150> you<00:02:03.690> don't<00:02:03.840> have<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.110> worry<00:02:04.290> about

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
to hell you don't have to worry about

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:13.150 
to hell you don't have to worry about
you<00:02:05.899> can<00:02:06.110> create<00:02:09.759> really<00:02:10.759> quite<00:02:10.970> beautiful

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
and if we pop that on let's just go out

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.680 
and if we pop that on let's just go out
of<00:02:15.350> ideomotor<00:02:15.710> pop<00:02:15.980> it<00:02:16.100> on
