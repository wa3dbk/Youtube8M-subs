00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:08.519
 one day we will see in 1592 he asks us 

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:12.090
 rescue 16 pets 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.730
 they are a lot of pets so 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.660
 we started loading the resort landmark of 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.970
 this 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.300
 and we are taking out the iron cubes for 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:24.800
 start 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.400
 to load it fast we take advantage 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.870
 these windmills 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:34.250
 we take advantage to make combinations 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.250
 more or less large 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:41.739
 we complete the spring much faster 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.080
 I concentrate I said nothing more than that 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:47.170
 for now take everything until we know 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:51.340
 all the iron cubes at least 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:55.290
 only to load the resort and everything 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.290
 and throwing it down there 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.360
 now yes we can 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.340
 begin to 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.520
 accommodate the shortest ones so they go 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.520
 coming out 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.950
 accommodating everything and the iron cubes 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.850
 that appear as much as possible 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.850
 we align them 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:21.530
 to save them with the spring and if not 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.799
 they bother leaving them directly 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.780
 Juanes in another part of the screen 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:29.670
 requirement that I always try to lower in 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.369
 those two columns in the middle 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.850
 then we go that they keep appearing in 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.370
 that 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.310
 in this column 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:41.350
 in that same is a little messy 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.770
 but greece is 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.899
 excellence is already there 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.110
 always play the same columns to 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:52.590
 where there is no iron in 12 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.810
 it's easier to lower the pets well 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.970
 I hope you can pass the level you 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.070
 also and see you in the next if 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:02.060
 God means they have a great day 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.060
 regards
