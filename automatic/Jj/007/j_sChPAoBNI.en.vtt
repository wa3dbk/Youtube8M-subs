one<00:00:17.160> yeah<00:00:17.640> that<00:00:18.000> was<00:00:18.119> foul<00:00:18.390> but<00:00:18.750> anyway<00:00:18.960> here

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
one yeah that was foul but anyway here

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.020 
one yeah that was foul but anyway here
we<00:00:19.289> are<00:00:19.530> so<00:00:20.039> you'll<00:00:20.220> need<00:00:20.310> rest<00:00:20.550> are<00:00:20.699> repeaters

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:21.030 
we are so you'll need rest are repeaters

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.089 
we are so you'll need rest are repeaters
on<00:00:21.300> every<00:00:21.570> second<00:00:22.050> block<00:00:22.380> for<00:00:22.679> eight<00:00:22.800> blocks

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:23.099 
on every second block for eight blocks

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:27.050 
on every second block for eight blocks
so<00:00:23.580> that's<00:00:24.300> four<00:00:24.769> five<00:00:25.769> six<00:00:26.339> seven<00:00:26.759> eight

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
so that's four five six seven eight

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.589 
so that's four five six seven eight
technically<00:00:27.720> it's<00:00:27.929> like<00:00:28.199> 16<00:00:28.830> walks<00:00:29.429> but<00:00:29.849> yeah

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
technically it's like 16 walks but yeah

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.020 
technically it's like 16 walks but yeah
you'll<00:00:31.140> also<00:00:31.289> need<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:31.589> put<00:00:31.769> some<00:00:32.099> stone<00:00:32.700> or

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
you'll also need to put some stone or

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.580 
you'll also need to put some stone or
some<00:00:33.210> cobblestone<00:00:33.540> I'm<00:00:33.870> just<00:00:34.020> using<00:00:34.200> stone

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
some cobblestone I'm just using stone

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.250 
some cobblestone I'm just using stone
for<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:34.890> fact<00:00:35.220> and<00:00:35.720> then<00:00:36.720> we<00:00:36.840> need<00:00:36.990> to<00:00:37.050> put<00:00:37.230> a

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
for a fact and then we need to put a

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.640 
for a fact and then we need to put a
redstone<00:00:40.040> oops<00:00:41.040> we<00:00:41.670> go<00:00:41.880> make<00:00:42.600> it<00:00:42.870> on<00:00:43.200> top<00:00:43.590> of

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:43.650 
redstone oops we go make it on top of

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.440 
redstone oops we go make it on top of
the<00:00:43.890> block<00:00:44.130> and<00:00:44.400> next<00:00:44.970> to<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.090> block<00:00:45.270> will

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
the block and next to the block will

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.540 
the block and next to the block will
make<00:00:45.600> an<00:00:45.750> ass<00:00:45.960> you'll<00:00:46.650> also<00:00:46.740> need<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.130> change

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
make an ass you'll also need to change

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.300 
make an ass you'll also need to change
these<00:00:48.140> one<00:00:49.140> notch<00:00:49.970> haha<00:00:50.970> not<00:00:51.560> so<00:00:52.560> they're<00:00:53.100> on<00:00:53.250> a

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:53.310 
these one notch haha not so they're on a

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:54.860 
these one notch haha not so they're on a
little<00:00:53.640> bit<00:00:53.760> of<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.880> delay<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.390> then<00:00:54.630> you<00:00:54.720> need

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
little bit of a delay and then you need

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.120 
little bit of a delay and then you need
to<00:00:54.930> put<00:00:55.110> in<00:00:55.230> your<00:00:55.550> note<00:00:56.550> blocks<00:00:57.740> now<00:00:58.740> go<00:00:58.920> and

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
then we can wire it up to a button there

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.570 
then we can wire it up to a button there
we<00:01:03.570> go<00:01:03.720> and<00:01:04.339> right<00:01:05.339> now<00:01:05.489> if<00:01:05.580> we<00:01:05.670> play<00:01:05.909> it

00:02:04.449 --> 00:02:04.459 
we play it if we've done it right how

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:06.880 
we play it if we've done it right how
cool<00:02:04.700> is<00:02:04.880> that<00:02:04.929> so<00:02:05.929> that's<00:02:06.259> the<00:02:06.409> basic

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
cool is that so that's the basic

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.839 
cool is that so that's the basic
tutorial<00:02:07.520> it's<00:02:08.380> pretty<00:02:09.380> cool<00:02:09.829> and<00:02:10.099> it<00:02:10.610> works

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849 
tutorial it's pretty cool and it works

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:13.390 
tutorial it's pretty cool and it works
think<00:02:11.480> that<00:02:11.629> was<00:02:11.750> on<00:02:11.900> that<00:02:12.650> was<00:02:12.799> on<00:02:12.950> too<00:02:13.250> much

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
think that was on that was on too much

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.699 
think that was on that was on too much
of<00:02:13.610> a<00:02:13.670> delay<00:02:14.140> so<00:02:15.140> I<00:02:15.170> think<00:02:15.260> that's<00:02:15.440> why<00:02:15.620> it

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
of a delay so I think that's why it

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.380 
of a delay so I think that's why it
sounded<00:02:16.069> weird<00:02:16.340> so<00:02:16.640> I'll<00:02:16.700> just<00:02:16.730> do<00:02:16.940> it<00:02:17.060> again

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.630 

there<00:02:20.390> we<00:02:20.569> go<00:02:20.720> that<00:02:20.900> sounds<00:02:21.170> much<00:02:21.290> better<00:02:21.640> and

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
there we go that sounds much better and

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.470 
there we go that sounds much better and
still<00:02:22.970> not<00:02:23.120> as<00:02:23.299> fast<00:02:23.569> as<00:02:23.900> it<00:02:24.500> is<00:02:25.190> but<00:02:25.489> this<00:02:26.329> is

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
still not as fast as it is but this is

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.000 
still not as fast as it is but this is
the<00:02:26.599> best<00:02:26.720> way<00:02:26.959> you<00:02:27.019> can<00:02:27.140> do<00:02:27.379> it<00:02:27.410> since

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
the best way you can do it since

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.240 
the best way you can do it since
