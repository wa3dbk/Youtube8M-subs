00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
pretty good there's probably only about

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.090 
pretty good there's probably only about
three<00:00:36.750> or<00:00:36.780> four<00:00:36.899> things<00:00:37.230> that<00:00:37.380> got<00:00:37.620> left<00:00:37.860> in

three or four things that got left in

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.650 
three or four things that got left in
here<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.730> that's<00:00:38.940> because<00:00:39.120> I<00:00:39.329> was<00:00:39.450> dealing

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
here and that's because I was dealing

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.840 
here and that's because I was dealing
with<00:00:39.989> small<00:00:40.320> flathead<00:00:40.710> screwdrivers<00:00:41.700> as

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
with small flathead screwdrivers as

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.720 
with small flathead screwdrivers as
opposed<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.450> hex<00:00:42.840> all<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.890> screws<00:00:44.250> on<00:00:44.550> this

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
opposed to a hex all the screws on this

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.510 
opposed to a hex all the screws on this
printer<00:00:45.180> are<00:00:45.420> hex<00:00:45.870> screws<00:00:46.440> so<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.129> few<00:00:47.309> things

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
printer are hex screws so the few things

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.549 
printer are hex screws so the few things
that<00:00:47.670> we<00:00:47.850> weren't<00:00:48.090> able<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.539> get<00:00:48.750> out<00:00:48.960> we<00:00:49.379> had<00:00:49.530> a

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
that we weren't able to get out we had a

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.770 
that we weren't able to get out we had a
motor<00:00:49.860> here<00:00:50.370> this<00:00:50.789> is<00:00:50.969> what<00:00:51.149> turn<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.600> gears

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
motor here this is what turn the gears

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.510 
motor here this is what turn the gears
to<00:00:52.020> get<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.230> paper<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.620> go<00:00:52.800> up<00:00:52.949> in<00:00:53.129> this<00:00:53.219> view

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
forth because of hex screws we had this

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.790 
forth because of hex screws we had this
motor<00:00:56.699> here<00:00:57.270> which<00:00:57.600> is<00:00:57.780> what<00:00:58.050> moved<00:00:58.500> our

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
motor here which is what moved our

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.670 
motor here which is what moved our
spooler<00:00:59.460> back<00:00:59.730> and<00:00:59.940> forth<00:01:00.180> again<00:01:00.690> hex<00:01:01.260> screws

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
spooler back and forth again hex screws

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.709 
spooler back and forth again hex screws
we<00:01:02.129> had<00:01:02.309> this<00:01:02.460> breadboard<00:01:02.820> here<00:01:03.329> which<00:01:03.510> had

got<00:01:05.970> through<00:01:06.180> two<00:01:06.450> of<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.720> hex<00:01:06.930> screws<00:01:07.260> that

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
got through two of the hex screws that

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.289 
got through two of the hex screws that
were<00:01:07.500> holding<00:01:07.770> in<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.130> board<00:01:08.400> but<00:01:08.790> there<00:01:09.180> was

thing that I thought about while I was
taking<00:01:30.689> this<00:01:30.990> printer<00:01:31.409> apart<00:01:31.829> is<00:01:32.460> I<00:01:32.610> want<00:01:32.790> to

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
taking this printer apart is I want to

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.760 
taking this printer apart is I want to
know<00:01:33.000> who<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.360> heck<00:01:33.720> makes<00:01:34.079> these<00:01:34.380> little

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
know who the heck makes these little

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.920 
know who the heck makes these little
things<00:01:34.799> what<00:01:35.549> these<00:01:35.790> are<00:01:36.030> their<00:01:36.360> little<00:01:36.600> clips

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
things what these are their little clips

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.140 
things what these are their little clips
that<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.290> stick<00:01:37.590> into<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.890> hole<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.579> then<00:01:39.000> it

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
that you stick into a hole and then it

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.870 
that you stick into a hole and then it
holds<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.750> wire<00:01:39.990> together<00:01:40.490> against<00:01:41.490> whatever

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
holds the wire together against whatever

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.510 
holds the wire together against whatever
surface<00:01:42.299> it's<00:01:42.720> connected<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:43.770> who<00:01:44.250> has<00:01:44.490> the

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
surface it's connected to who has the

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.149 
surface it's connected to who has the
patent<00:01:45.270> on<00:01:45.509> these<00:01:45.810> I<00:01:46.200> think<00:01:46.560> an<00:01:46.649> almost

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
patent on these I think an almost

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.889 
patent on these I think an almost
everything<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:47.820> we've<00:01:48.030> taken<00:01:48.060> apart<00:01:48.659> I've

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
everything that we've taken apart I've

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.200 
everything that we've taken apart I've
seen<00:01:49.290> one<00:01:49.530> of<00:01:49.649> these<00:01:49.770> things<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.850> only<00:01:51.180> other

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
seen one of these things the only other

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.360 
seen one of these things the only other
thing<00:01:51.450> that<00:01:51.659> I<00:01:51.810> guess<00:01:51.960> I<00:01:52.110> would<00:01:52.229> find

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.370 
thing that I guess I would find

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.030 
thing that I guess I would find
the<00:01:54.000> Rolly<00:01:54.300> thing<00:01:54.450> here<00:01:55.050> I<00:01:55.230> don't<00:01:55.830> know<00:01:55.890> why

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
the Rolly thing here I don't know why

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.590 
the Rolly thing here I don't know why
I've<00:01:56.160> always<00:01:56.310> been<00:01:56.490> interested<00:01:56.700> in<00:01:57.030> years<00:01:57.510> and

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
I've always been interested in years and

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.270 
I've always been interested in years and
things<00:01:58.020> that<00:01:58.200> move<00:01:58.470> oh<00:01:58.710> these<00:01:58.890> things<00:01:58.950> were

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
things that move oh these things were

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.280 
things that move oh these things were
interesting<00:01:59.820> the<00:01:59.940> way<00:01:59.970> these<00:02:00.240> were<00:02:00.510> you<00:02:00.810> turn

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
interesting the way these were you turn

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.990
