00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:07.190
 Nicolae made boilesen and defended from the arena last Sunday 

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:08.499
 debut in the first 

00:00:08.499 --> 00:00:11.339
 Frank the farmer does not hesitate to make his selection supplemented with 

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:13.059
 players from their own youth 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:15.420
 the plan top 10 a baby 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.730
 a strong failure 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.890
 and then you must not be able to store too much moisture, although you must have faith 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.529
 in playing in his youth 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:23.349
 but if it doesn't lose the bank 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:26.699
 because otherwise you might as well not sit on the couch so hence 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.399
 are flying out the door 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:31.399
 we could not have doubted for a moment 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.970
 the authorities it 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.670
 an emergency hold for what you do 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.790
 jobs costs 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.330
 and of course it is also one 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.570
 a logical consequence 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.900
 that must have been the step as 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.470
 players of the first for safe atmosphere 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.750
 what are you going to see what you have at home 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.970
 are you not convinced of that or 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.740
 7 so that moment no one wants to sit and then they could play for the 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.130
 collision 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.630
 we have the same philosophy on behalf of the draw's interests 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:07.630
 the same player playing style both have on 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.920
 if the young ajax that she walks can easily integrate into around 10 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.920
 if it is 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.950
 the diplomat 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.240
 Yes 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.770
 and then approve 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.770
 pay attention to what is asked in 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.440
 the discussions will also be a suggestion that you suddenly have to stand in. i 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.130
 find 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.270
 the 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.960
 what kind of opponent the PVV have agreed upon the boxes in the 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.450
 standard situations smoke some of wanting to use tactics against these 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.360
 opponent 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.040
 that has a idea with schuitema face October I suddenly have to go 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.680
 a boober what happens is all right 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.460
 and there you try to make such people 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.260
 that they are allowed to make mistakes as an editor-in-chief yes, that is part of it 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.320
 teacher all for your own game 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.290
 it's a reward came 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.090
 this season what happened so far mutu be judged on in it 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.569
 past is assessed for an entire season 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.739
 and because they have done a very good season this is the rewards 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:15.869
 ultimately by the toppers are not or queens 

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:19.199
 that the that the stuff where you as a reader player 

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:25.509
 then wait 

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:28.640
 The second year may only make a mistake 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.680
 the error is wrong because you have to do it 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.139
 be it often 

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:36.419
 People have constantly emerged as experienced 

00:02:36.419 --> 00:02:38.629
 go colleague 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:40.589
 the 

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:43.589
 the 

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:46.859
 4 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:51.049
 the invention the more experienced yes then you have to be there unexpectedly 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:53.879
 always structural sieves zuma 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:55.749
 that just belongs to ajax and 

00:02:55.749 --> 00:02:59.139
 these guys have a lot of talent but mostly experienced and also a lot 

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:00.589
 mental area 

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:01.980
 do they still have to live 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.909
 soon after his appointment in December the farmer left the base in the studio 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:07.799
 debuting against vitesse 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:09.110
 So 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.869
 Those were the visitors who repaid 

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:15.779
 In addition, therefore, the drivers do not break the storm bag 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.129
 has vicento 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:21.999
 hence there is no doubt about it 

00:03:21.999 --> 00:03:22.920
 to be made 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.529
 that went so well and ultimately 

00:03:25.529 --> 00:03:28.529
 sustain a very long period 

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:38.309
 what do they need says broker to make estate 

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:40.619
 from that the video is one 

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:43.949
 the difference with jolien and 

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:48.379
 due to a malfunction that you now actually see the deen is never something already starts one 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:52.309
 dude by another is still overpasses the little boy actually still 

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:55.959
 and if you come to the first one longer because that actually goes without saying 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:57.599
 becomes naive 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:59.259
 what you still have in childhood 

00:03:59.259 --> 00:04:03.319
 it may have but that it is just a process i have you with suddenly 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:05.679
 to make adults 

00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:07.949
 Then you go that he himself is also acting 

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:11.009
 moureaux ps for you then do it again for free 

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:15.499
 the there you have to think i'm still going in march and 

00:04:15.499 --> 00:04:18.659
 but want to stay out of my youth at the last minute and 

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:21.659
 head slowly back to Antwerp at that moment 

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:24.659
 a real feyenoord 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.969
 there were 14 

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:34.990
 to make the move 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.449
 a year falls 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:41.240
 the getting better in Aachen it remains for the bottle first goal made on what 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.039
 can of course help again such a process 

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:46.270
 there the strong one 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.520
 there she becomes less 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.590
 naively see the disease increase 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:54.669
 the 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:57.879
 for the player 

00:04:57.879 --> 00:05:00.879
 but a point especially in the mental field of leadership 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.930
 I also recently talked about I think it's wonderful 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.860
 drivers of the fed cup 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.469
 then make sure that 

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:11.659
 the player is bothered by lynden 5 and the same number of minutes 

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:18.600
 then the edge am of course if that plays 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.569
 the paving stones 

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:24.429
 it just has to be an incentive for the games themselves 

00:05:24.429 --> 00:05:25.909
 but also benefits 

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:27.630
 for the players 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:30.729
 who now play youths that simons 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:32.270
 the bridge is coming 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.629
 then you hope that without a ball 

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:35.849
 inner city 

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:36.970
 after being 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:37.630
 the hull of
