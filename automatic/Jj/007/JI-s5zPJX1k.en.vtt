preseason NFL under 36 it's not that low
of<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.590> total<00:00:43.920> maybe<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.250> total<00:00:44.550> will<00:00:44.670> go<00:00:44.820> down

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
of a total maybe the total will go down

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.450 
of a total maybe the total will go down
but<00:00:45.390> for<00:00:45.960> you<00:00:46.050> know<00:00:46.140> jack<00:00:46.860> del<00:00:47.070> rio<00:00:47.250> from

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
everything he's been saying it seems

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.090 
everything he's been saying it seems
like<00:00:48.870> it's<00:00:48.989> gonna<00:00:49.079> be<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.260> very<00:00:49.440> vanilla<00:00:49.739> game

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
like it's gonna be a very vanilla game

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.860 
like it's gonna be a very vanilla game
for<00:00:50.550> Oakland<00:00:50.940> we<00:00:51.059> know<00:00:51.239> that<00:00:51.420> st.<00:00:51.629> Louis

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
for Oakland we know that st. Louis

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.049 
for Oakland we know that st. Louis
should<00:00:52.320> be<00:00:52.469> uh<00:00:52.500> you<00:00:53.039> know<00:00:53.309> pretty<00:00:53.520> run<00:00:53.820> heavy

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
should be uh you know pretty run heavy

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.319 
should be uh you know pretty run heavy
and<00:00:55.129> defense-oriented<00:00:56.129> this<00:00:56.520> year<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.000> the

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
and defense-oriented this year the the

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.849 
and defense-oriented this year the the
offensive<00:00:57.809> line<00:00:57.840> is<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.260> big<00:00:58.469> question<00:00:58.829> mark

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
offensive line is a big question mark

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.260 
offensive line is a big question mark
for<00:00:59.039> them<00:00:59.250> so<00:00:59.430> they're<00:00:59.550> presumably<00:01:00.030> going<00:01:00.210> to

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
for them so they're presumably going to

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.000 
for them so they're presumably going to
be<00:01:00.359> doing<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.719> lot<00:01:00.930> of<00:01:00.989> running<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.680> lot<00:01:01.859> of

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
be doing a lot of running and a lot of

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.609 
be doing a lot of running and a lot of
testing<00:01:02.670> out<00:01:02.820> of<00:01:03.000> there<00:01:03.600> you<00:01:03.989> know<00:01:04.110> depth<00:01:04.409> and

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
testing out of there you know depth and

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.070 
testing out of there you know depth and
backups<00:01:05.610> on<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:06.150> offensive<00:01:06.659> line<00:01:06.689> in<00:01:06.990> this

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
backups on the offensive line in this

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.480 
backups on the offensive line in this
game<00:01:07.290> so<00:01:07.409> I'm<00:01:07.500> guessing<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:07.920> lot<00:01:07.950> of<00:01:08.250> running

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
game so I'm guessing a lot of running

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.460 
game so I'm guessing a lot of running
from<00:01:08.580> st.<00:01:08.850> Louis<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.210> lot<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.600> vanilla<00:01:10.170> stuff

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
from st. Louis a lot of a vanilla stuff

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.929 
from st. Louis a lot of a vanilla stuff
from<00:01:10.650> Oakland<00:01:11.070> I<00:01:11.189> guess<00:01:11.400> I'm<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.580> little<00:01:11.640> bit

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
from Oakland I guess I'm a little bit

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.630 
from Oakland I guess I'm a little bit
nervous<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:13.350> know<00:01:13.380> maybe<00:01:13.890> Derek<00:01:14.460> Carr

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
nervous that you know maybe Derek Carr

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.580 
nervous that you know maybe Derek Carr
lymari<00:01:15.060> Cooper<00:01:15.450> will<00:01:15.630> open<00:01:16.140> up<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.380> first

lymari Cooper will open up the first

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.960 
lymari Cooper will open up the first
quarter<00:01:16.860> with<00:01:17.070> two<00:01:17.159> touchdowns<00:01:17.580> or<00:01:17.729> something

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
quarter with two touchdowns or something

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.539

like<00:01:18.060> that<00:01:18.119> but<00:01:18.570> i<00:01:18.810> think<00:01:19.229> under<00:01:19.619> 36<00:01:20.220> is<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.369> play

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
like that but i think under 36 is a play

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.039 
like that but i think under 36 is a play

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
course living up to the hype and

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.899 
course living up to the hype and
practices<00:01:31.470> one<00:01:31.619> thing<00:01:31.890> preseason<00:01:32.490> so<00:01:32.759> now

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
practices one thing preseason so now

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.370 
practices one thing preseason so now
then<00:01:33.210> we<00:01:33.360> get<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.659> regular<00:01:33.960> season<00:01:34.110> but<00:01:34.320> I

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
then we get to the regular season but I

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.140 
then we get to the regular season but I
do<00:01:34.470> think<00:01:34.799> that<00:01:34.920> Cooper<00:01:35.610> is<00:01:35.640> going<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:36.000> come

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
do think that Cooper is going to come

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.719 
do think that Cooper is going to come
out<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.479> want<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:36.869> show<00:01:37.229> that<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:38.280> know<00:01:38.400> he<00:01:38.579> is

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
out and want to show that you know he is

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.580 
out and want to show that you know he is
something<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.390> as<00:01:39.479> we<00:01:39.630> know<00:01:39.659> that<00:01:40.079> Derek<00:01:40.380> Carr

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
something and as we know that Derek Carr

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.039 
something and as we know that Derek Carr
he<00:01:40.799> certainly<00:01:41.340> showed<00:01:41.610> some<00:01:41.880> progress<00:01:42.390> about

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
he certainly showed some progress about

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.840 
he certainly showed some progress about
being<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.500> franchise<00:01:43.979> quarterback<00:01:44.009> so<00:01:44.670> that's

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
being a franchise quarterback so that's

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.060 
being a franchise quarterback so that's
a<00:01:44.939> combination<00:01:45.180> I<00:01:45.689> do<00:01:45.750> think<00:01:46.140> it<00:01:46.259> has<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.680> little

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
a combination I do think it has a little

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.789 
a combination I do think it has a little
bit<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.460> prove<00:01:47.729> but<00:01:48.299> what<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:48.540> said<00:01:49.049> is<00:01:49.740> very

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
bit to prove but what you said is very

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.740 
bit to prove but what you said is very
true<00:01:50.460> that<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.880> Rams<00:01:51.270> are<00:01:51.420> going<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.659> be<00:01:51.720> a

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
true that the Rams are going to be a

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.929 
true that the Rams are going to be a
little<00:01:51.960> conservative<00:01:52.409> with<00:01:52.890> three<00:01:53.729> new

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
little conservative with three new

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.700 
little conservative with three new
starters<00:01:54.000> on<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.630> offensive<00:01:54.659> line<00:01:55.170> Nick

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
starters on the offensive line Nick

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.350 
starters on the offensive line Nick
Foles<00:01:56.009> as<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.280> guide<00:01:56.549> their<00:01:56.729> new<00:01:56.850> quarterback

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
Foles as a guide their new quarterback

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.600 
Foles as a guide their new quarterback
who<00:01:57.600> was<00:01:58.259> hurt<00:01:58.530> when<00:01:58.560> he<00:01:58.860> was<00:01:59.009> in<00:01:59.189> Philadelphia

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
who was hurt when he was in Philadelphia

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.520 
who was hurt when he was in Philadelphia
of<00:02:00.149> course<00:02:00.420> they<00:02:00.630> had<00:02:00.810> problems<00:02:01.350> with

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
of course they had problems with

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.020 
of course they had problems with
Bradford<00:02:02.009> always<00:02:02.280> getting<00:02:02.579> hurt<00:02:02.700> so<00:02:02.939> I<00:02:02.969> do

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
Bradford always getting hurt so I do

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.910 
Bradford always getting hurt so I do
think<00:02:03.450> that<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.719> Rams<00:02:03.930> will<00:02:04.110> be<00:02:04.229> very

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
think that the Rams will be very

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.499 
think that the Rams will be very
conservative<00:02:05.430> they<00:02:05.759> do<00:02:05.820> apparently<00:02:06.390> one

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
conservative they do apparently one

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.119 
conservative they do apparently one

quite<00:02:19.710> quickly<00:02:20.210> also<00:02:21.210> the<00:02:21.720> Rams<00:02:21.930> are<00:02:22.170> going<00:02:22.500> to

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
quite quickly also the Rams are going to

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.060 
quite quickly also the Rams are going to
go<00:02:22.740> deep<00:02:23.160> into<00:02:23.640> uh<00:02:24.150> there<00:02:24.840> they<00:02:25.200> might<00:02:25.620> use<00:02:25.860> all

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
go deep into uh there they might use all

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.800 
go deep into uh there they might use all
four<00:02:26.340> they<00:02:26.520> might<00:02:26.700> use<00:02:26.880> four<00:02:27.180> units<00:02:27.630> they're

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
four they might use four units they're

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.390 
four they might use four units they're
going<00:02:28.080> to<00:02:28.170> go<00:02:28.260> deep<00:02:28.500> into<00:02:28.680> their<00:02:28.830> bench<00:02:29.100> in<00:02:29.310> the

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
going to go deep into their bench in the

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.670 
going to go deep into their bench in the
second<00:02:29.820> half<00:02:30.030> and<00:02:30.330> their<00:02:30.900> defense<00:02:31.470> is

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
second half and their defense is

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.580 
second half and their defense is
definitely<00:02:32.190> deeper<00:02:32.790> than<00:02:33.420> their<00:02:33.660> offense<00:02:34.290> so

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
definitely deeper than their offense so

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.620 
definitely deeper than their offense so
I<00:02:34.620> know<00:02:34.800> you<00:02:34.950> liked<00:02:35.250> to<00:02:35.550> play<00:02:35.670> unders<00:02:36.270> because

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
I know you liked to play unders because

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.600 
I know you liked to play unders because
of<00:02:36.810> that<00:02:36.960> I<00:02:36.990> do<00:02:37.170> think<00:02:37.560> that<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:37.800> under<00:02:38.130> is<00:02:38.310> a

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
of that I do think that the under is a

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.270 
of that I do think that the under is a
pretty<00:02:39.030> good<00:02:39.240> play<00:02:39.450> well<00:02:39.780> I'm<00:02:39.990> going<00:02:40.200> under<00:02:40.620> 36

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
check on because I might wind up making

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.400 
check on because I might wind up making
a<00:02:50.400> premium<00:02:50.730> pick<00:02:50.910> on<00:02:51.270> this<00:02:51.540> game<00:02:51.720> but<00:02:51.870> I'm<00:02:51.990> not

a premium pick on this game but I'm not

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.320 
a premium pick on this game but I'm not
certain<00:02:52.680> so<00:02:52.920> we'll<00:02:53.070> say<00:02:53.280> it's<00:02:53.700> a<00:02:53.820> pass<00:02:54.060> which

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
certain so we'll say it's a pass which

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.090 
certain so we'll say it's a pass which
forces<00:02:54.690> you<00:02:54.870> to<00:02:54.990> make<00:02:55.140> that<00:02:55.170> pick<00:02:55.590> all<00:02:55.890> right
