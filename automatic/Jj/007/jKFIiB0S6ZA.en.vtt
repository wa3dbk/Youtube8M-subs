00:00:02.860 --> 00:01:20.460 

today<00:00:03.860> we<00:00:04.100> are<00:00:04.190> going<00:00:04.370> to<00:00:29.380> we're<00:00:30.380> using<00:00:30.529> clean

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.710 

so<00:01:21.470> this<00:01:21.619> water<00:01:22.250> soaking<00:01:22.850> in<00:01:23.030> is<00:01:23.270> basically

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
so this water soaking in is basically

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.270 
so this water soaking in is basically
going<00:01:23.990> to<00:01:24.080> pull<00:01:24.290> through<00:01:24.500> the<00:01:24.619> pores<00:01:24.950> of<00:01:25.220> the

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
going to pull through the pores of the

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:45.090 
going to pull through the pores of the
wood<00:01:25.340> up<00:01:25.780> to<00:01:26.780> allow<00:01:27.020> the<00:01:27.080> bleach<00:01:27.470> to<00:01:27.799> get<00:01:27.979> in

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.620 

we're<00:01:46.100> gonna<00:01:46.190> bleep<00:01:46.490> sit<00:01:46.670> all<00:01:46.820> the<00:01:46.850> same<00:01:47.330> time

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
we're gonna bleep sit all the same time

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.980 
we're gonna bleep sit all the same time
so<00:01:47.990> there<00:01:48.170> I<00:01:49.000> essentially<00:01:50.000> have<00:01:51.789> iteration

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
so there I essentially have iteration

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.529 
so there I essentially have iteration
solution<00:01:53.990> of<00:01:54.800> course<00:01:54.979> our<00:01:55.190> hope<00:01:55.399> is<00:01:55.640> that<00:01:55.909> once

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:56.539 
solution of course our hope is that once

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:57.340 
solution of course our hope is that once
will<00:01:56.720> be<00:01:56.869> enough

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
will be enough

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:10.059 
will be enough
we<00:01:58.039> won't<00:01:58.220> need<00:01:58.369> number<00:01:58.759> two

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:14.100 

clink<00:02:10.910> Starfleet's<00:02:11.450> whip<00:02:12.290> bleeps<00:02:12.530> comes<00:02:12.890> in

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
clink Starfleet's whip bleeps comes in

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:20.140 
clink Starfleet's whip bleeps comes in
two<00:02:15.110> gallon<00:02:15.440> container<00:02:16.299> Part<00:02:17.299> A<00:02:17.890> and<00:02:19.030> Part<00:02:20.030> B

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
two gallon container Part A and Part B

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.569 
two gallon container Part A and Part B
which<00:02:20.900> are<00:02:21.110> mixed<00:02:21.799> into<00:02:21.980> equal<00:02:22.880> amounts

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:24.579 
which are mixed into equal amounts

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:27.400 
which are mixed into equal amounts
proportions<00:02:25.579> and<00:02:25.850> then<00:02:26.000> we<00:02:26.180> use<00:02:26.420> just<00:02:27.260> a

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
proportions and then we use just a

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:33.449 
proportions and then we use just a
simple<00:02:27.799> foaming<00:02:28.190> to<00:02:28.940> lay<00:02:29.930> the<00:02:30.140> leaves<00:02:30.410> on

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:03:34.850 

respirators<00:02:34.459> are<00:02:35.090> a<00:02:35.120> good<00:02:35.390> thing<00:02:35.600> we're<00:02:36.470> told

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.430 

so<00:03:35.860> now<00:03:36.040> we're<00:03:36.250> applying<00:03:36.490> the<00:03:36.790> bleach<00:03:37.540> on<00:03:37.840> to

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
so now we're applying the bleach on to

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.640 
so now we're applying the bleach on to
the<00:03:38.730> avatar<00:03:39.730> which<00:03:40.570> is<00:03:40.600> the<00:03:41.080> would<00:03:41.320> done

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
the avatar which is the would done

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.960 
the avatar which is the would done
Dannenberg<00:03:42.130> tells<00:03:43.000> us<00:03:43.270> the<00:03:43.720> century<00:03:44.640> used<00:03:45.640> for

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
Dannenberg tells us the century used for

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:51.750 
Dannenberg tells us the century used for
its<00:03:46.230> it's<00:03:47.230> blind<00:03:47.650> decking<00:03:50.250> so<00:03:51.250> the<00:03:51.460> trick<00:03:51.730> is

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
its it's blind decking so the trick is

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.060 
its it's blind decking so the trick is
to<00:03:51.940> get<00:03:52.240> a<00:03:52.270> a<00:03:52.510> full<00:03:53.170> coat<00:03:53.470> on<00:03:55.470> but<00:03:56.470> not<00:03:56.650> so<00:03:56.890> much

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.070 
to get a a full coat on but not so much

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.480 
to get a a full coat on but not so much
that<00:03:57.340> it<00:03:57.520> runs<00:03:57.700> down<00:03:58.000> the<00:03:58.330> sides<00:03:58.630> and<00:03:59.380> onto<00:04:00.370> the

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:00.490 
that it runs down the sides and onto the

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:03.240 
that it runs down the sides and onto the
top<00:04:01.030> sides<00:04:01.330> on<00:04:01.540> to<00:04:01.690> the<00:04:01.810> finished<00:04:02.680> varnish<00:04:03.070> of

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
top sides on to the finished varnish of

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:35.410 
top sides on to the finished varnish of
the<00:04:03.430> top<00:04:03.640> sides

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:35.420 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.780 

not<00:04:36.420> easy<00:04:36.840> to<00:04:37.290> see<00:04:37.560> but<00:04:37.860> we<00:04:38.100> can<00:04:38.130> tell<00:04:38.550> where

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
not easy to see but we can tell where

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.240 
not easy to see but we can tell where
it's<00:04:38.970> working<00:04:39.320> it's<00:04:40.320> begun<00:04:40.620> working<00:04:41.010> because

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
it's working it's begun working because

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.570 
it's working it's begun working because
the<00:04:41.990> material<00:04:42.990> on<00:04:43.110> top<00:04:43.290> has<00:04:43.560> begun<00:04:43.890> foaming<00:04:44.460> up

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
the material on top has begun foaming up

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.060 
the material on top has begun foaming up
a<00:04:44.700> little<00:04:44.850> bit

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
a little bit

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:51.680 
a little bit
yep<00:04:48.320> brian<00:04:49.320> is<00:04:50.240> pointing<00:04:51.240> out<00:04:51.300> where<00:04:51.540> it's

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
yep brian is pointing out where it's

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:59.330 
yep brian is pointing out where it's
foaming<00:04:57.230> and<00:04:58.230> we<00:04:58.320> discovered<00:04:58.860> that<00:04:58.890> it<00:04:59.100> really

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
foaming and we discovered that it really

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.680 
foaming and we discovered that it really
takes<00:05:01.160> very<00:05:02.160> very<00:05:02.250> little<00:05:02.700> of<00:05:02.910> the<00:05:03.120> solution

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
takes very very little of the solution

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:09.370 
takes very very little of the solution
so<00:05:04.530> we<00:05:04.740> are<00:05:04.980> gonna<00:05:05.760> go<00:05:06.000> back<00:05:06.180> in<00:05:07.070> lay<00:05:08.070> on<00:05:08.250> a<00:05:08.280> a

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.380 
so we are gonna go back in lay on a a

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:18.230 
so we are gonna go back in lay on a a
follow-up<00:05:10.380> heavy<00:05:10.650> coat<00:05:16.610> yes<00:05:17.610> we<00:05:17.820> want<00:05:18.120> it

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
follow-up heavy coat yes we want it

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:29.770 
follow-up heavy coat yes we want it
blunt<00:05:19.700> but<00:05:20.700> it'll<00:05:21.330> be<00:05:21.420> smart<00:05:21.780> blunt

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.930 

now<00:05:30.780> we're<00:05:30.990> gonna<00:05:31.080> let<00:05:31.380> her<00:05:31.500> sit<00:05:32.400> for<00:05:32.640> a<00:05:32.670> couple

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
now we're gonna let her sit for a couple

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.640 
now we're gonna let her sit for a couple
of<00:05:33.000> hours<00:05:33.120> and<00:05:35.480> we'll<00:05:36.480> be<00:05:36.630> back<00:05:36.840> to<00:05:37.290> see<00:05:37.500> what

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
of hours and we'll be back to see what

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:43.320 
of hours and we'll be back to see what
the<00:05:37.770> result<00:05:38.100> is<00:05:38.280> at<00:05:38.550> the<00:05:38.700> other<00:05:38.850> second

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:43.330 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.180 

so<00:05:44.330> we're<00:05:44.480> now<00:05:44.660> about

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:47.190 
so we're now about

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:50.940 
so we're now about
two<00:05:47.790> hours<00:05:48.150> after<00:05:48.390> applying<00:05:48.870> the<00:05:49.080> bleach

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:50.950 
two hours after applying the bleach

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:54.210 
two hours after applying the bleach
and<00:05:51.280> you<00:05:51.790> can<00:05:51.970> see<00:05:52.180> in<00:05:52.300> this<00:05:52.450> light<00:05:52.720> that<00:05:53.220> the

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:54.220 
and you can see in this light that the

00:05:54.220 --> 00:06:00.230 
and you can see in this light that the
colors<00:05:54.580> not<00:05:54.760> really<00:05:55.510> uniform<00:05:55.870> yet<00:05:56.140> because

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:04.040 

it's<00:06:00.630> not<00:06:00.900> uniformly<00:06:01.800> derived<00:06:02.400> across<00:06:03.180> the

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.050 
it's not uniformly derived across the

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.930 
it's not uniformly derived across the
surfaces

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:06.940 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:11.590 

like<00:06:07.540> tomorrow<00:06:08.100> when<00:06:09.100> we<00:06:09.280> neutralize<00:06:09.940> it

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:11.600 
like tomorrow when we neutralize it

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.140 
like tomorrow when we neutralize it
that<00:06:12.050> the<00:06:12.200> uniformly<00:06:12.830> brown<00:06:13.190> what's

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:14.150 
that the uniformly brown what's

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:19.480 
that the uniformly brown what's
particularly<00:06:14.870> neat<00:06:15.400> is<00:06:16.400> that

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:19.490 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:25.970 

we<00:06:20.490> were<00:06:20.730> reduced<00:06:21.450> to<00:06:21.840> using

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:25.980 

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:29.150 

-<00:06:26.520> plugs<00:06:27.120> and<00:06:28.080> we're<00:06:28.230> concerned<00:06:28.710> that<00:06:28.890> we

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:29.160 
- plugs and we're concerned that we

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.710 
- plugs and we're concerned that we
weren't<00:06:29.400> going<00:06:29.610> to<00:06:29.700> be<00:06:29.760> able<00:06:29.880> to<00:06:30.030> bleach<00:06:30.420> them

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:30.720 
weren't going to be able to bleach them

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.119 
weren't going to be able to bleach them
white<00:06:30.800> enough

00:06:33.119 --> 00:06:33.129 
white enough
