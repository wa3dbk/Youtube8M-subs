00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
start with that's what I use and I just

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.020 
start with that's what I use and I just
take<00:01:08.040> my<00:01:08.280> roller<00:01:09.350> and<00:01:10.350> twist<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:11.310> ends<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.820> my

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030

hair<00:01:12.060> around<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.840> road<00:01:13.049> first<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.950> secure<00:01:14.369> it

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
hair around the road first to secure it

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.990 
hair around the road first to secure it
you<00:01:16.560> can<00:01:16.740> see<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.250> then<00:01:17.970> just<00:01:18.390> roll<00:01:18.630> up

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.460 

and<00:01:22.120> then<00:01:22.270> when<00:01:22.390> I<00:01:22.480> get<00:01:22.660> to<00:01:22.750> the<00:01:22.810> top<00:01:23.020> I<00:01:23.230> just

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
and then when I get to the top I just

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:47.590 
and then when I get to the top I just
been<00:01:23.740> to<00:01:24.160> the<00:01:24.580> end<00:01:26.280> it's<00:01:27.280> secure

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.210 

so<00:01:48.600> as<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:48.870> can<00:01:48.960> see<00:01:49.020> if<00:01:49.260> I<00:01:49.409> move<00:01:49.530> that<00:01:49.770> section

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
so as you can see if I move that section

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.120 
so as you can see if I move that section
and<00:01:50.460> I'll<00:01:50.640> come<00:01:50.880> back<00:01:51.060> when<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.360> rest<00:01:51.479> is<00:01:51.630> done

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
and I'll come back when the rest is done

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.440 
and I'll come back when the rest is done
so<00:01:53.130> as<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.369> can<00:01:53.490> see<00:01:53.550> I<00:01:53.670> have<00:01:53.820> two<00:01:54.000> sections

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
so as you can see I have two sections

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.410 
so as you can see I have two sections

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
had to take into another room just

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.520 
had to take into another room just
because<00:04:50.180> lighting<00:04:50.509> was<00:04:50.750> better<00:04:50.990> in<00:04:51.169> there<00:04:51.380> so

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
because lighting was better in there so

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.100 
because lighting was better in there so
you<00:04:51.650> could<00:04:51.860> see<00:04:52.160> it<00:04:52.220> properly<00:04:52.400> and<00:04:53.360> yep<00:04:53.930> this

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
you could see it properly and yep this
