hi guys Rick here back with another lick

00:00:50.400 --> 00:01:00.830 
hi guys Rick here back with another lick
to<00:00:50.640> make<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.970> guys<00:00:51.180> go<00:00:54.350> and<00:00:55.580> the<00:00:56.580> women<00:00:56.879> go<00:00:57.120> ah

but<00:01:01.019> as<00:01:01.140> always<00:01:01.320> it's<00:01:01.769> not<00:01:01.949> really<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.309> lick<00:01:02.580> is

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
but as always it's not really a lick is

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.299 
but as always it's not really a lick is
it<00:01:02.940> it's<00:01:03.120> more<00:01:03.330> of<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.570> rapid-fire<00:01:04.309> pentatonic

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
it it's more of a rapid-fire pentatonic

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.370 
it it's more of a rapid-fire pentatonic
picking<00:01:05.760> pattern<00:01:06.180> but<00:01:06.720> what<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:06.990> it<00:01:07.140> let's

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
picking pattern but what of it let's

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.620 
picking pattern but what of it let's
crack<00:01:07.619> on<00:01:07.650> with<00:01:07.830> it<00:01:08.070> it's<00:01:08.640> in<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.820> key<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.180> B<00:01:11.630> so

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
crack on with it it's in the key of B so

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.190 
crack on with it it's in the key of B so
starting<00:01:13.140> up<00:01:13.200> fret<00:01:13.500> 9<00:01:14.509> no<00:01:15.509> it's<00:01:15.660> not<00:01:15.780> fret<00:01:16.020> 9th

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
starting up fret 9 no it's not fret 9th

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.290 
starting up fret 9 no it's not fret 9th
fret<00:01:16.530> 7<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.670> we're<00:01:17.759> going<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:17.940> play<00:01:18.090> this

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:18.300 
fret 7 and we're going to play this

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:24.950 
fret 7 and we're going to play this
repeating<00:01:18.869> pattern<00:01:21.500> ok<00:01:22.500> so<00:01:22.920> we<00:01:23.039> get<00:01:23.330> 7<00:01:24.330> 9<00:01:24.690> 10

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
repeating pattern ok so we get 7 9 10

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.660 
repeating pattern ok so we get 7 9 10
then<00:01:25.340> we<00:01:26.340> bar<00:01:26.700> here<00:01:27.180> fret<00:01:27.690> 9<00:01:28.070> and<00:01:29.070> then

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
then we bar here fret 9 and then

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.990 
then we bar here fret 9 and then
continue<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.119> pattern

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.960 

I'm<00:01:35.000> going<00:01:35.240> to<00:01:35.299> go<00:01:35.390> 10<00:01:35.720> 12<00:01:36.020> on<00:01:36.530> the<00:01:36.619> B<00:01:36.799> then<00:01:37.610> 10

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
I'm going to go 10 12 on the B then 10

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:46.830 
I'm going to go 10 12 on the B then 10
14<00:01:38.510> and<00:01:38.810> it's<00:01:38.990> into<00:01:39.890> a<00:01:39.920> B<00:01:40.369> minor<00:01:40.760> 7<00:01:41.240> arpeggio

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.460 

we're<00:01:47.840> picking<00:01:48.200> every<00:01:48.409> note<00:01:48.560> on<00:01:48.590> this

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.850 

okay<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:53.400> that<00:01:53.520> whole<00:01:53.700> pattern<00:01:53.940> sort<00:01:54.840> of<00:01:54.960> that

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
okay and that whole pattern sort of that

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.150 
okay and that whole pattern sort of that
section<00:01:56.340> comes<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.330> this<00:01:58.260> point<00:01:58.500> here<00:01:58.950> the

00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.160 
section comes to this point here the

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.750 
section comes to this point here the
where<00:01:59.640> we<00:01:59.850> play<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.150> fifth<00:02:00.390> degree<00:02:00.540> of<00:02:00.810> B<00:02:01.760> at

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.760 
where we play the fifth degree of B at

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:11.210 
where we play the fifth degree of B at
fret<00:02:03.210> 16<00:02:04.020> so<00:02:04.350> I'll<00:02:04.620> do<00:02:04.740> that<00:02:04.770> slowly<00:02:09.890> okay<00:02:10.890> now

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
fret 16 so I'll do that slowly okay now

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.500 
fret 16 so I'll do that slowly okay now
we're<00:02:11.640> going<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:11.820> go<00:02:11.910> back<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.210> the<00:02:12.300> fifth

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
we're going to go back to the fifth

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.870 
we're going to go back to the fifth
string<00:02:12.800> I'm<00:02:13.800> going<00:02:13.920> to<00:02:14.040> play<00:02:14.190> this<00:02:14.310> pentatonic

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
string I'm going to play this pentatonic

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.620 
string I'm going to play this pentatonic
pattern<00:02:16.250> okay<00:02:17.250> so<00:02:17.310> we<00:02:17.490> have<00:02:17.580> two<00:02:17.820> notes<00:02:18.120> on<00:02:18.390> the

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
pattern okay so we have two notes on the

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.750 
pattern okay so we have two notes on the
a<00:02:18.660> one<00:02:19.590> on<00:02:19.740> the<00:02:19.830> D<00:02:20.010> and<00:02:20.040> three<00:02:20.580> on<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:20.760> G<00:02:22.760> okay

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
a one on the D and three on the G okay

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.130 
a one on the D and three on the G okay
once<00:02:24.240> we've<00:02:24.360> done<00:02:24.450> that<00:02:24.510> we're<00:02:24.780> going<00:02:24.870> to<00:02:24.930> come

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
once we've done that we're going to come

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.540 
once we've done that we're going to come
back<00:02:25.290> to<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:25.560> D<00:02:25.710> string<00:02:25.770> I'm<00:02:26.190> going<00:02:26.280> to<00:02:26.400> play

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
back to the D string I'm going to play

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.040 
back to the D string I'm going to play
two<00:02:27.200> then<00:02:28.200> three

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
two then three

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.640 
two then three
while<00:02:31.050> on<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.319> bee<00:02:32.990> that's<00:02:33.990> not<00:02:34.380> the<00:02:34.500> right

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
while on the bee that's not the right

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.210 
while on the bee that's not the right
now<00:02:34.860> is<00:02:35.040> it<00:02:36.110> that's<00:02:37.110> it<00:02:37.319> three<00:02:37.650> on<00:02:37.770> the<00:02:37.800> top<00:02:38.010> E

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
now is it that's it three on the top E

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:44.420 
now is it that's it three on the top E
so<00:02:38.459> that<00:02:38.730> pattern<00:02:43.100> once<00:02:44.100> we've<00:02:44.250> done<00:02:44.370> that

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
so that pattern once we've done that

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.980 
so that pattern once we've done that
we're<00:02:44.730> going<00:02:44.819> to<00:02:44.880> shift<00:02:45.209> down<00:02:45.360> with<00:02:45.810> a<00:02:45.840> little

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
we're going to shift down with a little

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.420 
we're going to shift down with a little
finger<00:02:46.290> and<00:02:46.590> play

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:56.520 

okay

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:03.550 

that<00:02:57.530> takes<00:02:57.800> us<00:02:57.980> up<00:02:58.010> to<00:02:58.130> here<00:02:58.810> at<00:02:59.810> fret<00:03:00.260> 17<00:03:02.560> okay

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
that takes us up to here at fret 17 okay

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.210 
that takes us up to here at fret 17 okay
and<00:03:04.010> the<00:03:04.130> last<00:03:04.370> pattern<00:03:04.760> moves<00:03:05.720> down<00:03:06.170> to<00:03:07.010> fret

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
and the last pattern moves down to fret

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:14.369 
and the last pattern moves down to fret
14<00:03:07.520> and<00:03:07.910> we<00:03:07.970> get<00:03:08.120> this<00:03:09.790> really<00:03:10.790> nice

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:14.379 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:20.410 

great<00:03:15.379> little<00:03:16.340> little<00:03:17.290> sequence<00:03:18.290> there<00:03:19.420> and

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
great little little sequence there and

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.580 
great little little sequence there and
I'm<00:03:20.510> going<00:03:20.629> to<00:03:20.689> do<00:03:20.780> the<00:03:20.900> same<00:03:21.079> thing<00:03:21.260> an<00:03:21.349> octave

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
I'm going to do the same thing an octave

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.559 
I'm going to do the same thing an octave
lower<00:03:23.950> then<00:03:24.950> we're<00:03:25.099> finished<00:03:25.280> so<00:03:26.239> all

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:26.569 
lower then we're finished so all

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:43.140 
lower then we're finished so all
together<00:03:26.959> nice<00:03:27.200> and<00:03:27.439> slowly

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.880 

okay<00:03:44.150> then<00:03:44.690> we<00:03:44.810> get<00:03:44.900> this<00:03:45.080> a<00:03:45.110> little<00:03:45.260> hybrid

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
okay then we get this a little hybrid

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.010 
okay then we get this a little hybrid
thing<00:03:46.400> which<00:03:47.150> might<00:03:47.360> take<00:03:47.599> a<00:03:47.630> bit<00:03:47.870> of<00:03:47.930> practice

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.020 
thing which might take a bit of practice

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.339 
thing which might take a bit of practice
if<00:03:48.560> you're<00:03:48.680> not<00:03:48.770> used<00:03:48.980> to<00:03:49.099> it<00:03:50.020> picking<00:03:51.020> pattern

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:51.349 
if you're not used to it picking pattern

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:55.690 
if you're not used to it picking pattern
goes<00:03:51.560> up<00:03:52.520> down<00:03:53.480> like<00:03:53.870> on<00:03:54.020> the<00:03:54.170> E<00:03:54.200> and<00:03:54.709> then<00:03:55.640> a

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
goes up down like on the E and then a

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.220 
goes up down like on the E and then a
middle<00:03:56.209> finger<00:03:56.540> or<00:03:56.720> hybrid<00:03:57.230> with<00:03:58.069> the<00:03:59.080> on<00:04:00.080> the

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
middle finger or hybrid with the on the

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:05.440 
middle finger or hybrid with the on the
D<00:04:00.410> string<00:04:00.440> so<00:04:02.080> down<00:04:03.370> Highbury<00:04:04.370> and<00:04:05.090> what<00:04:05.360> we're
