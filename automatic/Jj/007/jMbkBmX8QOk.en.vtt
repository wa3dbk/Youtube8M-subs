00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
disappointing didn't keep him to nil but

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.760 
disappointing didn't keep him to nil but
i<00:02:42.370> think<00:02:42.640> you<00:02:42.700> know<00:02:42.760> overall<00:02:43.350> not<00:02:44.350> only<00:02:44.590> on<00:02:44.680> the

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
i think you know overall not only on the

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.620 
i think you know overall not only on the
field<00:02:45.010> would<00:02:45.100> come<00:02:45.310> closer<00:02:45.580> to<00:02:45.700> give<00:02:45.940> up<00:02:46.060> so

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
field would come closer to give up so

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.350 
field would come closer to give up so
this<00:02:47.280> preparations<00:02:48.280> for<00:02:48.370> mixer<00:02:48.700> I<00:02:49.000> think<00:02:49.270> it

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
this preparations for mixer I think it

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.940 
this preparations for mixer I think it
was<00:02:49.390> a<00:02:49.480> bigger<00:02:49.690> winning<00:02:50.020> margin<00:02:50.440> so<00:02:50.650> not

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
was a bigger winning margin so not

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.340 
was a bigger winning margin so not
another<00:02:51.400> step<00:02:51.640> in<00:02:51.790> the<00:02:51.880> right<00:02:52.030> direction<00:02:52.350> well

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
another step in the right direction well

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.979 
another step in the right direction well
I<00:02:53.530> can<00:02:53.709> say<00:02:53.860> we<00:02:54.400> weren't<00:02:54.580> too<00:02:55.510> bothered<00:02:55.810> by<00:02:55.870> the

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
I can say we weren't too bothered by the

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:57.170 
I can say we weren't too bothered by the
school<00:02:56.290> we<00:02:56.410> said<00:02:56.590> to<00:02:56.680> worry<00:02:56.830> about<00:02:56.920> ourselves

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
school we said to worry about ourselves

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.790 
school we said to worry about ourselves
at<00:02:58.180> times<00:02:58.510> here<00:02:58.750> you<00:02:58.870> know<00:02:59.020> made<00:02:59.320> some

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
at times here you know made some

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.120 
at times here you know made some
mistakes<00:03:00.160> including<00:03:00.370> myself<00:03:01.739> but<00:03:02.739> you<00:03:03.010> know

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
mistakes including myself but you know

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.860 
mistakes including myself but you know
that<00:03:03.340> cohesion<00:03:03.760> is<00:03:04.120> getting<00:03:04.570> better<00:03:04.690> and

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
that cohesion is getting better and

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.080 
that cohesion is getting better and
stronger<00:03:05.200> every<00:03:05.380> time<00:03:05.650> we<00:03:05.770> meet<00:03:05.950> up<00:03:06.130> so<00:03:06.400> the

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
stronger every time we meet up so the

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.090 
stronger every time we meet up so the
bullet<00:03:07.360> on<00:03:07.540> world<00:03:07.780> cup<00:03:07.989> comes<00:03:08.230> you<00:03:08.770> know<00:03:08.920> would

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
bullet on world cup comes you know would

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.160 
bullet on world cup comes you know would
be<00:03:09.220> much<00:03:09.550> hotter<00:03:09.790> unit<00:03:10.150> yeah<00:03:10.510> it<00:03:10.630> was<00:03:10.750> good<00:03:10.900> and

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
be much hotter unit yeah it was good and

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.320 
be much hotter unit yeah it was good and
I<00:03:11.560> think<00:03:11.770> the<00:03:11.830> series<00:03:12.220> as<00:03:12.700> a<00:03:12.760> whole<00:03:12.910> been<00:03:13.300> a

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
I think the series as a whole been a

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.330 
I think the series as a whole been a
muscle<00:03:13.840> successful<00:03:14.380> it's<00:03:14.500> not<00:03:14.620> just<00:03:14.799> not<00:03:15.310> just

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
muscle successful it's not just not just

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.229 
muscle successful it's not just not just
what<00:03:15.519> we've<00:03:15.640> done<00:03:15.700> on<00:03:15.820> the<00:03:15.910> field<00:03:16.060> you<00:03:16.209> know

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
what we've done on the field you know

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.420

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.759 
the limits of what we're trying to
achieve<00:03:43.180> and<00:03:43.600> they've<00:03:43.870> done<00:03:43.989> a<00:03:44.049> very<00:03:44.230> best<00:03:44.440> to

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
achieve and they've done a very best to

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:46.470 
achieve and they've done a very best to
achieve<00:03:44.860> that<00:03:45.220> and<00:03:45.640> it<00:03:45.760> gets<00:03:45.910> like<00:03:46.120> we<00:03:46.150> had<00:03:46.330> to

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
achieve that and it gets like we had to

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.699 
achieve that and it gets like we had to
wait<00:03:46.600> for<00:03:46.660> the<00:03:46.870> benefits<00:03:47.530> of<00:03:47.620> the

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
wait for the benefits of the

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:49.380 
wait for the benefits of the
high-altitude<00:03:48.010> I<00:03:48.519> guess<00:03:48.640> left<00:03:48.880> away<00:03:49.120> and<00:03:49.269> so

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
high-altitude I guess left away and so

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:50.550 
high-altitude I guess left away and so
we're<00:03:49.540> getting<00:03:49.780> to<00:03:49.870> the<00:03:49.959> World<00:03:50.140> Cup<00:03:50.290> see<00:03:50.500> the
