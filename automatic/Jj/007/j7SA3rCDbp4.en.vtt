to practice we are at the practice ility
so<00:03:51.040> so<00:03:51.639> this<00:03:51.909> is<00:03:51.940> a<00:03:52.150> mini<00:03:52.659> game<00:03:52.870> called<00:03:53.229> Target

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
so so this is a mini game called Target

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.819 
so so this is a mini game called Target
to<00:03:53.709> target<00:03:55.109> you<00:03:56.109> know<00:03:56.199> you<00:03:56.260> can<00:03:56.440> see<00:03:56.650> there's

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:56.829 
to target you know you can see there's

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:58.500 
to target you know you can see there's
all<00:03:56.979> sorts<00:03:57.310> of<00:03:57.370> stuff<00:03:57.430> going<00:03:57.790> on<00:03:58.000> out<00:03:58.209> here<00:03:58.239> you

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
all sorts of stuff going on out here you

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.990 
all sorts of stuff going on out here you
got<00:03:58.659> water<00:03:58.959> to<00:03:59.199> worry<00:03:59.409> about<00:03:59.590> you<00:04:00.430> have<00:04:00.639> a

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
got water to worry about you have a

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.490 
got water to worry about you have a
bunch<00:04:01.599> of<00:04:01.690> it<00:04:01.840> I<00:04:01.900> think<00:04:01.959> we<00:04:02.109> have<00:04:02.139> six

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
bunch of it I think we have six

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:03.809 
bunch of it I think we have six
different<00:04:02.620> greens<00:04:03.040> out<00:04:03.280> here<00:04:03.519> they're<00:04:03.790> all

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:03.819 
different greens out here they're all

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:07.409 
different greens out here they're all
tricked<00:04:04.299> out<00:04:04.449> bunkers<00:04:05.280> windmills<00:04:06.419> no

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:07.419 
tricked out bunkers windmills no

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:10.559 
tricked out bunkers windmills no
windmills<00:04:07.780> with<00:04:08.709> the<00:04:08.799> nose<00:04:09.040> no<00:04:09.729> so<00:04:10.449> this

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 
windmills with the nose no so this

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:13.890 
windmills with the nose no so this
minigame<00:04:10.870> is<00:04:11.109> basically<00:04:11.560> yeah<00:04:12.400> you<00:04:12.669> know<00:04:12.900> my

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
minigame is basically yeah you know my

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.979 
minigame is basically yeah you know my
