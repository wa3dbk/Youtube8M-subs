at<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.880> ends<00:00:30.180> using<00:00:30.359> beading<00:00:30.990> cones<00:00:31.309> but

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
at the ends using beading cones but

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.619 
at the ends using beading cones but
let's<00:00:32.519> start<00:00:32.730> out<00:00:32.850> by<00:00:32.970> using<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.390> knitting

00:00:33.619 --> 00:00:33.629 
let's start out by using the knitting

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:36.290 
let's start out by using the knitting
tool<00:00:33.840> so<00:00:34.650> what<00:00:34.800> this<00:00:34.949> is<00:00:35.160> is<00:00:35.400> you<00:00:36.090> made<00:00:36.210> me

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
tool so what this is is you made me

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.580 
tool so what this is is you made me
remember<00:00:36.600> this<00:00:36.720> from<00:00:36.930> your<00:00:36.989> childhood<00:00:37.470> a

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
remember this from your childhood a

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.740 
remember this from your childhood a
spool<00:00:38.010> knitter<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.550> it's<00:00:38.970> specially

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
spool knitter and it's specially

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.960 
spool knitter and it's specially
designed<00:00:40.110> for<00:00:40.290> using<00:00:40.470> it<00:00:40.680> with<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:40.830> wire<00:00:41.040> so<00:00:41.879> I'm

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:41.970 
designed for using it with a wire so I'm

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.270 
designed for using it with a wire so I'm
using<00:00:42.150> 28<00:00:42.720> gauge<00:00:42.960> wire<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.650> you're<00:00:44.100> just

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
using 28 gauge wire and you're just

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.740 
using 28 gauge wire and you're just
going<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.519> pass<00:00:44.729> it<00:00:44.940> down<00:00:45.089> through<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.479> center

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
going to pass it down through the center

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.680 
going to pass it down through the center
of<00:00:45.839> the<00:00:45.960> tool<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.970> you<00:00:47.970> want<00:00:48.150> your<00:00:48.239> end<00:00:48.449> to

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
of the tool and you want your end to

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.689 
of the tool and you want your end to
extend<00:00:49.110> out<00:00:49.350> by<00:00:49.620> about<00:00:49.860> five<00:00:50.129> or<00:00:50.339> six<00:00:50.489> inches

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:52.699 
extend out by about five or six inches

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:57.320 
extend out by about five or six inches
and<00:00:54.379> then<00:00:55.379> you're<00:00:55.530> going<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.769> attach<00:00:56.640> it<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:57.030> a

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:57.330 
and then you're going to attach it to a

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.660 
and then you're going to attach it to a
weight<00:00:57.659> and<00:00:58.019> that<00:00:58.680> helps<00:00:58.979> to<00:00:59.040> maintain<00:00:59.280> an

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
weight and that helps to maintain an

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.000 
weight and that helps to maintain an
even<00:00:59.850> tension<00:01:00.239> while<00:01:00.570> you're<00:01:00.750> working<00:01:01.010> to

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
even tension while you're working to

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.380 
even tension while you're working to
attach<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.460> weight<00:01:02.610> it<00:01:02.760> doesn't<00:01:02.909> have<00:01:03.150> to<00:01:03.269> be

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
attach the weight it doesn't have to be

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.210 
attach the weight it doesn't have to be
fancy<00:01:03.600> you<00:01:03.869> can<00:01:04.140> just<00:01:04.440> twist<00:01:04.739> your<00:01:04.830> wires

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
fancy you can just twist your wires

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.780 
fancy you can just twist your wires
together<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:06.030> hook<00:01:06.869> it<00:01:07.020> on<00:01:07.490> just<00:01:08.490> make<00:01:08.610> sure

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
together and hook it on just make sure

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.010 
together and hook it on just make sure
that<00:01:08.820> it's<00:01:09.119> tight<00:01:09.299> enough<00:01:09.330> that<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:09.869> won't

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
that it's tight enough that it won't

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.740 
that it's tight enough that it won't
fall<00:01:10.200> off<00:01:10.909> then<00:01:11.909> when<00:01:12.060> you're<00:01:12.180> ready<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.540> start

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.289 
this is going to start to form the top
of<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.909> tube<00:02:12.120> of<00:02:12.420> shape<00:02:13.670> now<00:02:14.670> for<00:02:14.879> the<00:02:14.970> second

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
of the tube of shape now for the second

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:18.649 
of the tube of shape now for the second
pass<00:02:15.480> you're<00:02:16.170> going<00:02:16.409> to<00:02:16.500> hold<00:02:16.709> the<00:02:16.890> end<00:02:17.659> your

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:18.659 
pass you're going to hold the end your

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:24.860 
pass you're going to hold the end your
wire<00:02:19.760> bring<00:02:20.760> it<00:02:20.850> around<00:02:21.709> over<00:02:22.709> the<00:02:22.920> top<00:02:23.870> over

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
wire bring it around over the top over

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.740 
wire bring it around over the top over
the<00:02:24.959> top<00:02:24.990> again<00:02:25.700> you're<00:02:26.700> always<00:02:26.819> crossing<00:02:27.480> in

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
the top again you're always crossing in

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.490 
the top again you're always crossing in
a<00:02:28.319> counterclockwise<00:02:30.140> way<00:02:31.140> around<00:02:32.069> that<00:02:32.400> prong

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
a counterclockwise way around that prong

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
a counterclockwise way around that prong
now<00:02:34.500> you're<00:02:34.650> going<00:02:34.770> to<00:02:34.830> bring<00:02:35.040> your<00:02:35.160> bottom

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
now you're going to bring your bottom

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.900 
now you're going to bring your bottom
loop<00:02:35.700> up<00:02:35.940> and<00:02:36.300> over<00:02:36.890> and<00:02:37.890> you<00:02:38.430> can<00:02:38.580> do<00:02:38.730> this

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
loop up and over and you can do this

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.640 
loop up and over and you can do this
with<00:02:39.209> other<00:02:39.360> gauges<00:02:39.810> of<00:02:39.959> wire<00:02:39.990> so<00:02:40.440> you<00:02:40.500> don't

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
with other gauges of wire so you don't

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.490 
with other gauges of wire so you don't
have<00:02:40.830> to<00:02:40.980> work<00:02:41.160> just<00:02:41.459> with<00:02:41.610> 28<00:02:42.000> gauge<00:02:42.290> but<00:02:43.290> this

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
have to work just with 28 gauge but this

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.170 
have to work just with 28 gauge but this
one<00:02:43.680> is<00:02:43.800> an<00:02:43.980> easier<00:02:44.430> one<00:02:44.610> to<00:02:44.640> start<00:02:45.000> with

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
one is an easier one to start with

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.350 
one is an easier one to start with
because<00:02:45.420> it's<00:02:45.720> more<00:02:46.280> flexible<00:02:47.280> it's<00:02:48.090> a<00:02:48.150> little

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
because it's more flexible it's a little

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.589 
because it's more flexible it's a little
bit<00:02:48.480> more<00:02:48.630> forgiving<00:02:50.030> you<00:02:51.030> could<00:02:51.180> in<00:02:51.300> it<00:02:51.510> of

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
bit more forgiving you could in it of

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:52.670 
bit more forgiving you could in it of
course<00:02:51.660> it<00:02:51.930> comes<00:02:52.110> in<00:02:52.260> a<00:02:52.319> lot<00:02:52.440> of<00:02:52.500> different

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
course it comes in a lot of different

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.410 
course it comes in a lot of different
colors<00:02:53.160> that<00:02:53.520> you<00:02:53.580> can<00:02:53.819> coordinate<00:02:54.030> with

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
colors that you can coordinate with

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.110 
colors that you can coordinate with
whatever<00:02:54.660> beads<00:02:55.050> you're<00:02:55.260> using<00:02:55.910> so<00:02:56.910> I'm<00:02:57.000> going

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
whatever beads you're using so I'm going

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.620 
whatever beads you're using so I'm going
to<00:02:57.180> continue<00:02:58.760> all<00:02:59.760> the<00:02:59.819> way<00:03:00.030> around<00:03:00.120> and<00:03:00.569> you

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
to continue all the way around and you

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.390 
to continue all the way around and you
can<00:03:00.750> start<00:03:01.020> to<00:03:01.170> see<00:03:01.349> that<00:03:01.530> it's<00:03:01.680> making<00:03:02.069> a<00:03:02.160> tube

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
can start to see that it's making a tube

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.430 
can start to see that it's making a tube
now<00:03:03.120> if<00:03:03.240> you<00:03:03.330> wanted<00:03:03.569> to<00:03:03.720> you<00:03:03.870> could<00:03:04.020> run<00:03:04.230> some

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
now if you wanted to you could run some

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.020 
now if you wanted to you could run some
beads<00:03:04.680> down<00:03:04.980> through<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:05.550> center<00:03:05.790> of<00:03:05.910> the

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
beads down through the center of the

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.580 
beads down through the center of the
tube<00:03:06.209> and<00:03:06.420> that<00:03:06.540> creates<00:03:06.870> a<00:03:06.959> kind<00:03:07.050> of<00:03:07.170> a<00:03:07.260> netted

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
tube and that creates a kind of a netted

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.800 
tube and that creates a kind of a netted
captured<00:03:08.099> effect<00:03:08.430> but<00:03:09.209> I'm<00:03:09.300> just<00:03:09.540> going<00:03:09.720> to

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
captured effect but I'm just going to

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.370 
captured effect but I'm just going to
use<00:03:10.739> this<00:03:10.950> as<00:03:11.190> a<00:03:11.250> basic<00:03:11.910> tube<00:03:12.150> so<00:03:12.599> we'll

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
use this as a basic tube so we'll

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.580 
use this as a basic tube so we'll
continue<00:03:13.560> making<00:03:14.550> our<00:03:14.880> loops<00:03:15.150> all<00:03:15.870> the<00:03:16.349> way

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
continue making our loops all the way

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.680 
continue making our loops all the way
around<00:03:16.920> now<00:03:17.190> what<00:03:18.000> it's<00:03:18.120> going<00:03:18.300> to<00:03:18.390> start<00:03:18.569> to

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
around now what it's going to start to

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.780 
around now what it's going to start to
look<00:03:18.900> like<00:03:18.959> as<00:03:19.380> it<00:03:19.410> comes<00:03:19.890> out<00:03:20.069> the<00:03:20.220> bottom<00:03:20.580> of

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
look like as it comes out the bottom of

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.240 
look like as it comes out the bottom of
the<00:03:20.970> tool<00:03:21.180> is<00:03:21.390> this<00:03:22.200> knitted<00:03:22.530> tube<00:03:22.709> here<00:03:23.069> and

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
the tool is this knitted tube here and

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.670 
the tool is this knitted tube here and
you<00:03:24.120> can<00:03:24.300> pull<00:03:24.780> this<00:03:24.930> a<00:03:24.989> little<00:03:25.170> bit<00:03:25.410> with<00:03:25.560> your

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
you can pull this a little bit with your

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.170 
you can pull this a little bit with your
hands<00:03:25.890> but<00:03:26.099> you<00:03:26.160> don't<00:03:26.400> want<00:03:26.580> to<00:03:26.640> be<00:03:26.760> sure<00:03:27.000> be

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
hands but you don't want to be sure be

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.640 
hands but you don't want to be sure be
sure<00:03:27.330> not<00:03:27.510> to<00:03:27.569> flatten<00:03:28.020> it<00:03:28.080> out<00:03:28.200> too<00:03:28.440> much

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
sure not to flatten it out too much

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.620 
sure not to flatten it out too much
because<00:03:29.280> we<00:03:29.520> do<00:03:29.640> want<00:03:29.790> to<00:03:29.849> maintain<00:03:30.000> the<00:03:30.450> shape

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
because we do want to maintain the shape

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.860 
because we do want to maintain the shape
of<00:03:30.870> that<00:03:31.319> tube<00:03:31.680> now<00:03:32.580> when<00:03:32.760> once<00:03:33.180> you've<00:03:33.360> worked

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
of that tube now when once you've worked

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.540 
of that tube now when once you've worked
it<00:03:34.050> so<00:03:34.349> that<00:03:34.500> you<00:03:34.560> have<00:03:34.590> a<00:03:34.709> long<00:03:34.980> chain<00:03:35.280> like

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
it so that you have a long chain like

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.820 
it so that you have a long chain like
this<00:03:35.819> then<00:03:36.209> you're<00:03:36.360> ready<00:03:36.510> to<00:03:36.599> remove<00:03:36.870> it<00:03:37.200> and

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
this then you're ready to remove it and

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.530 
this then you're ready to remove it and
there's<00:03:38.010> one<00:03:38.190> little<00:03:38.400> tip<00:03:38.580> for<00:03:38.910> removing<00:03:38.940> it

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
there's one little tip for removing it

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.720 
there's one little tip for removing it
you<00:03:39.810> want<00:03:40.440> to<00:03:40.500> make<00:03:40.530> kind<00:03:40.950> of<00:03:41.040> a<00:03:41.160> long<00:03:41.370> tail

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
you want to make kind of a long tail

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.290 
you want to make kind of a long tail
here<00:03:42.180> and<00:03:42.800> then<00:03:43.800> you're<00:03:43.950> going<00:03:44.190> to<00:03:44.430> pass<00:03:45.000> it

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.300 
here and then you're going to pass it

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.460 
here and then you're going to pass it
through<00:03:46.080> the<00:03:46.890> loops<00:03:47.160> on<00:03:47.810> the<00:03:48.810> top<00:03:48.840> of<00:03:49.230> the

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
through the loops on the top of the

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.250 
through the loops on the top of the
pattern<00:03:49.800> so<00:03:50.340> make<00:03:50.550> sure<00:03:50.580> that<00:03:50.730> you<00:03:50.970> capture

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
pattern so make sure that you capture

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.890 
pattern so make sure that you capture
each<00:03:52.260> of<00:03:52.530> those<00:03:52.910> loops<00:03:53.910> as<00:03:54.270> you<00:03:54.510> go<00:03:54.629> all<00:03:54.810> the

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
each of those loops as you go all the

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.220 
each of those loops as you go all the
way<00:03:54.930> around<00:03:56.510> we're<00:03:57.510> just<00:03:57.720> going<00:03:57.870> to<00:03:57.900> go<00:03:58.050> around

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
way around we're just going to go around

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:03.680 
way around we're just going to go around
all<00:03:58.620> four<00:03:58.980> and<00:04:00.230> then<00:04:01.230> we'll<00:04:01.440> be<00:04:01.560> able<00:04:01.770> to<00:04:02.690> cinch

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
all four and then we'll be able to cinch

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.430 
all four and then we'll be able to cinch
it<00:04:03.840> up<00:04:04.519> now<00:04:05.519> this<00:04:05.640> tool<00:04:05.910> also<00:04:06.360> is<00:04:06.660> there<00:04:07.230> is<00:04:07.410> a

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
it up now this tool also is there is a

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.740 
it up now this tool also is there is a
