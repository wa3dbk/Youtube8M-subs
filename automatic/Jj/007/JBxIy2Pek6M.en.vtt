00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.049
 already known title 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.430
 for example, pinkish purple became more playable 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.320
 character in super smash brothers 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.960

 nintendo can experience new conditions 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.680
 So there were a few more 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.000
 surprises ready we hope now 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.350
 but really on big new announcement 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.060

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.829
 this is already playing to a new star wars 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.840

 the space title by using thai 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.390
 fighter and x1 in the big battle 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.829
 But there is some skepticism about it 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.479
 appropriate attacks of dreams will be 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.250
 namely a free to play game and 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.909
 supports only 16 players multiplayer 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.740
 fight 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.840
 also graphically you look newest 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.950
 title not necessarily stunning times 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.509
 wait 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.399
 apparently , the developments are approaching 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:55.539
 mass effect four makes great progress 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:57.640
 that at least goes from a twitter 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:59.409
 plus from bioware developer flynn 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.479
 He writes that the next part 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.460
 the Zeiss already ag is now playable 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.560
 and already beautiful looks 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.250
 on the other hand already damn much 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.750
 fun makes us hope for the best 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.519
 the analysts of cowen &amp; company 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.319
 According to the sales figures of 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:16.239
 call of duty goes far behind 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:18.430
 expectations of both investors and 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.650
 also activision itself compared to 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.780
 black ops 2 in the previous year was only 19 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.340
 had sold worse before 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.720
 activision in the face of the consoles 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.380
 generation changes you expections 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.720
 customized 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.849
 these were now undercut chief 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.069
 executive officer eric hirshberg believes 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:34.630
 not that the partly rather moderate 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.220
 criticisms for big influence 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.079
 the sales figures finally have 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.519
 Listen to the fans and give them something 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:41.079
 they want whatever they want 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:42.730
 We may hope for falling numbers 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:44.560
 that activision is as a consequence of that 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.150
 dare more with the next call of duty 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.760
 and simply a better game 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.530
 deliver 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.730

 of the Holy Roman Empire 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.389
 should 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:03.220
 The developers emphasize that 

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:04.180
 no fantasy elements and no magic 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.859
 in this world there 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.540
 instead they want to come with kingdom 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:09.040
 tie up the medieval battle as well 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.569
 provide very ego-perspective 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.010
 the role play is 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:14.109

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:11.500
 look further down there 

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:13.750

 remains the episode necessarily times 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.440
 daily 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.150

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.159
 I take her to the master chiefs 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.590
