00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
various materials that are used in

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.890 
various materials that are used in
drawing<00:00:16.379> a<00:00:16.770> variety<00:00:17.490> of<00:00:17.880> pencils<00:00:18.570> that<00:00:18.720> are

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
drawing a variety of pencils that are

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.490 
drawing a variety of pencils that are
both<00:00:19.170> hard<00:00:19.680> and<00:00:20.039> soft<00:00:20.689> the<00:00:21.689> FS

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
both hard and soft the FS

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.700 
both hard and soft the FS
and<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:23.490> H<00:00:23.699> is<00:00:23.730> being<00:00:24.330> hard<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:25.880> the<00:00:26.880> beaze

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710 
and the H is being hard and the beaze

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.240 
and the H is being hard and the beaze
being<00:00:28.710> softer<00:00:29.640> and<00:00:29.970> also<00:00:30.750> darker<00:00:31.289> they<00:00:32.070> don't

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
being softer and also darker they don't

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.250 
being softer and also darker they don't
really<00:00:32.399> get<00:00:32.640> this<00:00:32.820> concept<00:00:33.450> until<00:00:34.140> they

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
really get this concept until they

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.060 
really get this concept until they
actually<00:00:34.550> extrait<00:00:35.809> so<00:00:36.809> one<00:00:37.620> of<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.829> things

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
actually extrait so one of the things

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.360 
actually extrait so one of the things
that<00:00:38.340> I<00:00:38.370> do<00:00:38.489> is<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.899> give<00:00:40.469> all<00:00:40.680> my<00:00:40.890> students<00:00:41.250> a

piece of paper where they can then

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.610 
piece of paper where they can then
divide<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.460> sheet<00:00:44.489> in<00:00:45.110> different<00:00:46.110> sections

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
divide the sheet in different sections

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.880 
divide the sheet in different sections
about<00:00:46.980> 6<00:00:47.309> sections<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:48.170> they<00:00:49.170> begin<00:00:49.530> by

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
about 6 sections and they begin by

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:56.299 
about 6 sections and they begin by
writing<00:00:50.700> in<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.120> first<00:00:51.390> section<00:00:51.780> 2<00:00:52.469> h<00:00:52.789> HB<00:00:54.140> b<00:00:55.309> 2

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
b 4b and 6b I asked them to take these

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.200 
b 4b and 6b I asked them to take these
pencils<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:02.100> with<00:01:03.030> each<00:01:03.449> pencil<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.830> draw<00:01:05.010> the

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
pencils and with each pencil to draw the

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.990 
pencils and with each pencil to draw the
lightest<00:01:06.210> light<00:01:06.659> line<00:01:07.320> that<00:01:07.799> they<00:01:07.950> can<00:01:08.220> with

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
lightest light line that they can with

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.020 
lightest light line that they can with
each<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.479> them<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:09.960> then<00:01:10.710> gradually<00:01:11.670> in<00:01:11.790> about

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
each of them and then gradually in about

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.450 
each of them and then gradually in about
10<00:01:12.479> steps<00:01:14.299> get<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.600> darkest<00:01:16.020> one<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.560> they

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
10 steps get to the darkest one and they

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.260 
10 steps get to the darkest one and they
find<00:01:17.930> very<00:01:18.930> surprisingly<00:01:19.740> that<00:01:20.250> pencils<00:01:20.820> have

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
find very surprisingly that pencils have

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.340 
find very surprisingly that pencils have
different<00:01:21.979> hardnesses<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.220> softness<00:01:23.640> --is

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
different hardnesses and softness --is

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.469 
different hardnesses and softness --is
darknesses<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.560> likenesses<00:01:26.479> thicknesses

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
darknesses and likenesses thicknesses

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.460 
darknesses and likenesses thicknesses
and<00:01:27.840> Fitness's<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:29.310> h's<00:01:29.850> being<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.290> F's

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
and Fitness's the h's being and the F's

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.310 
and Fitness's the h's being and the F's
being<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:33.119> hardest<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:35.000> lighter<00:01:36.140> when<00:01:37.140> you

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
being the hardest and lighter when you

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.690 
being the hardest and lighter when you
really<00:01:37.710> really<00:01:37.740> press<00:01:38.250> down<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.869> 6b

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
really really press down and the 6b

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.359 
really really press down and the 6b
getting<00:01:41.700> darker<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:43.430> also<00:01:44.540> softer<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:46.020> you

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
getting darker and also softer and you

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.700 
getting darker and also softer and you
can<00:01:47.369> just<00:01:47.579> see<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.939> difference<00:01:48.409> in<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.649> lines

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
can just see the difference in the lines

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.250 
can just see the difference in the lines
I<00:01:51.000> explained<00:01:52.000> to<00:01:52.210> them<00:01:52.390> the<00:01:52.780> different

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:53.260 
I explained to them the different

which<00:02:40.000> is<00:02:40.239> a<00:02:40.600> value<00:02:41.230> scale<00:02:41.590> I<00:02:42.180> explained<00:02:43.180> that

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
which is a value scale I explained that

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.520 
which is a value scale I explained that
a<00:02:43.450> value<00:02:43.930> scale<00:02:44.350> is<00:02:45.090> similar<00:02:46.090> to<00:02:46.450> a<00:02:46.810> musical

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
but in the visual world a value scale as

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.710 
but in the visual world a value scale as
a<00:02:58.750> difference<00:02:59.320> in<00:02:59.590> tone<00:02:59.920> so<00:03:00.850> this<00:03:01.060> value<00:03:01.299> scale

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
a difference in tone so this value scale

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.620 
a difference in tone so this value scale

finished with that and they have a

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.229 
finished with that and they have a
feeling<00:03:44.140> of<00:03:44.380> how<00:03:44.890> pencils<00:03:45.400> are<00:03:45.549> blended<00:03:46.000> I

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
feeling of how pencils are blended I

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:48.690 
feeling of how pencils are blended I
then<00:03:46.900> explained<00:03:47.440> to<00:03:47.650> them<00:03:47.799> the<00:03:47.859> concept<00:03:48.549> of

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
then explained to them the concept of

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.590 
then explained to them the concept of
volume<00:03:49.829> light<00:03:50.829> and<00:03:51.040> dark<00:03:51.340> and<00:03:51.670> it's

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
volume light and dark and it's

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.009 
volume light and dark and it's
illustrated<00:03:52.870> by<00:03:53.739> a<00:03:54.130> 3-dimensional<00:03:55.120> sphere<00:03:55.329> on

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
illustrated by a 3-dimensional sphere on

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:59.580 
illustrated by a 3-dimensional sphere on
the<00:03:56.859> right<00:03:57.250> of<00:03:57.579> the<00:03:57.850> columns<00:03:58.269> so<00:03:59.169> they<00:03:59.470> are

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
the right of the columns so they are

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.690 
the right of the columns so they are
then<00:03:59.859> supposed<00:04:00.130> to<00:04:00.639> take

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
then supposed to take

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.660 
then supposed to take
a<00:04:01.790> pencil<00:04:02.599> of<00:04:02.840> their<00:04:03.020> choice<00:04:03.349> and<00:04:03.379> I<00:04:04.250> recommend

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
a pencil of their choice and I recommend

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.130 
a pencil of their choice and I recommend
the<00:04:05.239> to<00:04:05.629> be<00:04:05.840> for<00:04:06.230> being<00:04:06.440> 6b<00:04:06.980> to<00:04:07.099> do<00:04:07.280> that<00:04:07.489> and<00:04:07.760> I

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
the to be for being 6b to do that and I

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.860 
the to be for being 6b to do that and I
try<00:04:09.140> to<00:04:09.170> encourage<00:04:10.010> my<00:04:10.370> students<00:04:10.849> not<00:04:11.180> to

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
try to encourage my students not to

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.100 
try to encourage my students not to
depend<00:04:12.260> on<00:04:12.440> blenders<00:04:13.099> so<00:04:13.370> much<00:04:13.640> but<00:04:14.390> to<00:04:14.599> really

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.110 
depend on blenders so much but to really

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
depend on blenders so much but to really
depend<00:04:15.319> on<00:04:16.180> their<00:04:17.180> hand<00:04:17.859> pressing<00:04:18.859> and

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
depend on their hand pressing and

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.830 
depend on their hand pressing and
softening<00:04:20.060> so<00:04:20.630> they<00:04:20.840> can<00:04:21.049> learn<00:04:21.260> the<00:04:21.530> skill<00:04:22.010> of

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
softening so they can learn the skill of

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.129 
softening so they can learn the skill of
just<00:04:23.840> using<00:04:24.410> your<00:04:24.650> hand<00:04:25.040> I<00:04:25.400> will<00:04:25.850> then<00:04:26.240> now<00:04:26.840> go

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:27.139 
just using your hand I will then now go

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:32.290 
just using your hand I will then now go
to<00:04:27.200> a<00:04:27.440> couple<00:04:28.160> of<00:04:28.370> student<00:04:29.330> examples<00:04:30.139> of<00:04:31.300> the

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
to a couple of student examples of the

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.469 
to a couple of student examples of the
