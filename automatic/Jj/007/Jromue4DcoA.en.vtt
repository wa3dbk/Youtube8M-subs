00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
and the first thing to do is to measure

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.460 
and the first thing to do is to measure
the<00:03:04.430> jig<00:03:04.730> head<00:03:04.910> alongside<00:03:05.300> the<00:03:05.750> tail<00:03:05.989> like<00:03:06.290> I'm

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
the jig head and have a look where the

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.440 
the jig head and have a look where the
bend<00:03:12.560> of<00:03:12.799> the<00:03:12.890> hook<00:03:13.430> comes<00:03:13.910> to<00:03:14.120> because<00:03:14.420> that

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
bend of the hook comes to because that

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.270

is<00:03:14.780> where<00:03:14.989> you're<00:03:15.080> going<00:03:15.230> to<00:03:15.320> want<00:03:15.500> the<00:03:15.980> point

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
is where you're going to want the point

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.250 
is where you're going to want the point
to<00:03:16.459> exit<00:03:16.850> when<00:03:16.970> you<00:03:17.060> rig<00:03:17.269> it<00:03:17.390> now<00:03:17.900> I'll<00:03:18.080> note

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.570 
to exit when you rig it now I'll note
that's<00:03:18.530> about<00:03:18.799> that's<00:03:19.070> about<00:03:19.160> half<00:03:19.489> a
