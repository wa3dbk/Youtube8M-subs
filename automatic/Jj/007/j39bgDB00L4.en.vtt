00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:08.550
 so welcome to the second part of which the PSP Go features video order 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.550
 Today I would like to clarify 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:14.819
 so far silence can be 

00:00:14.819 --> 00:00:19.259
 Like the PSG Goalie on-board system, it works like the EHC Gran 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:21.570
 Turismo Korbel will get in five days 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.829
 and again for prey 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:27.179
 that percent 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:30.539
 also the percent that on Screen 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.110
 because I do not say 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.440
 a bit closer to mowing 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.530
 Percent must be Markets 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.450
 make up 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.960
 Clement 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.330
 Sar now 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.190
 percent 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.970
 Sabine Jäger 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.160
 the Swico gets to the head this great Uhlir 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.180
 Vreden percent with whom do Bamber 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.490
 with the owner 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.520
 can do a great thing and 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.290
 no fast calendars here 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.090
 Ads can not be large but can be as with entries 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.090
 Triumphant Susan Boyle says 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.910
 Manchester also met today were percent 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.450
 the storage media 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:15.640
 graze 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.720
 she changed me from there 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.720
 Process in which I now become others 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.370
 Of course I'll already know the PSP Go 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.170
 Barisic 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.400
 Proto 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.750
 and percent 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.730
 the Sony PSP Go forest percent 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.390
 the smaller one gets the Theremin Mystique Mike Schoen 2 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.330
 We can also say that is buy 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.980
 until 10 we are this year as the dar 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.500
 and around 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.280
 the same at 8 1 but saving time for the percent 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.920
 for the bean really there 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.900
 So you can see a lot of space 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.900
 lead it 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.870
 flat2flat Marot off 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.020
 On the PSP go for counter is more portable actions 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.469
 and 70 the creditors comes to speak 

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:10.469
 szo 

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:13.469
 Contours 

00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:19.289
 So this Week or Goals and Gran Turismo portable action are actually relative 

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:20.649
 i 

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:22.369
 a-tec has the 

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:26.589
 the mows through the same com com with the short I have here two more three days 

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:29.589
 to get

 all world Gran Turismo cable shareholder rights him the Beatles in 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.709
 fourth quarter here 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.329
 and that would have to be a miracle that percent 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:50.329
 that the learning materials 

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:54.439
 and then he gets automatic e-mail after a few days 

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:58.999
 Percent now comma for the noise 

00:02:58.999 --> 00:03:01.789
 the STIKO 

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:02.799
 like Works 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.509
 the sequence works as follows 

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:07.689
 more about 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:09.739
 takes 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:14.580
 you invite percent more all registered for your duty figure in that he 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:17.099
 The end of this mother caught 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:19.489
 is quite linear download 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:21.049

 with the with the lowlands I also lured into the gate 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:46.079

 Kyle Busch also made Sony off against it 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.449

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:49.629
 empty promises 

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:50.889
