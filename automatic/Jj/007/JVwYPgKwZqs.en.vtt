 in this section we have a cute recipe to please the little afagal 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.400
 "Potato Paste with Tomato" 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.720
 But if you want to have a look at the required material first 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.120
 1 potato 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.600
 1 tomato 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.360
 half water cup water 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.720
 1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.480
 and salt 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.240
 now we can proceed to the production of our food 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.000
 First of all, we've peeled our potatoes 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.000
 and chop us up 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 not so important, how to be crushed 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.120
 let's take the bowl 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.160
 we robbed our tomato 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.120
 To feed our children correctly ... 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.120
 let's do this in tomato season 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.920
 now we cut the core, the core of the core are scraped out 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.640
 now let's chop this up fine 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.120
 we're adding this to our potatoes 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.040
 half a cup of water on the water 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.080
 adding a flick 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.240
 The caravan is not harmful, contains 82 mines in it 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.200
 we strongly recommend kayatuzu 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.680
 fire 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.640
 in the middle of the fire, the cover 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.880
 and cook until the potato is soft 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.960
 yes our potatoes have softened 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.880
 cooked food 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.960
 Now, finally, for our baby's intestine to work better ... 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.200
 1 teaspoon of pure olive oil to leave 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.160
 let's mix 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.280
 Cover the cover 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.280
 Let's wait a bit to cool down 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.120
 It's time for our food to be puree now 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.560
 crush with fork 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.160
 Yes now service time 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:08.920
 We can eat this baby after 1 year 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.640
 yes, that's it 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.640
 Modest Flavors in this part of the kitchen ... 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.360
 we shared a beautiful recipe for babies 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.040
 We learned the production of "Potato Paste with Tomato" 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.720

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.680
