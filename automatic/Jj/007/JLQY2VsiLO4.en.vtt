00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:12.030
 Hello friends I did not have time 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.650
 talk about the topic 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:18.390
 where in america take this or that food 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.380
 tasty but not tasty where to find that 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.580
 which do you want 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.919
 how then i got the question more on 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.980
 really serious is the question where 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:31.230
 take the usual medicines specifically here 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.380
 in the situation that you ask us 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.780
 there is a young man he periodically 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:41.430
 there with some purity arise 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:44.160
 severe headaches and what to do 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.230
 enough today enjoys analgin and 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.390
 says he will give everything 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.249
 I tried it 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.030
 the rest is analgin for him right away 

00:00:50.249 --> 00:00:56.699
 where he works is that it is now in 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.890
 America is a suitcase analgin I carry 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.929
 your narrow analgin suitcase is simply not 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.329
 allowed to hold because there is 

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:08.220
 certain transport restrictions 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:09.960
 medications but let's we so in more 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.650
 broadly speaking i am not that i am to 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.210
 Fortunately, I do not need such questions 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.250
 decide I somehow got used to the local 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.380
 medicine when he came was healthy 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.230
 did not use drugs at all now 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.920
 I already like 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:26.110
 to the place ok but i remember was the case 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.210
 we have the only such item plot 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.070
 when we needed valerian 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:33.190
 here valerian conclusion we somehow 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:36.550
 we know that we were good with valerian 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:38.910
 and almost start in the Russian store and there is 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:41.470
 in the Russian store shelf such 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:44.920
 essentially i can actually go 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:47.140
 and and actually shoot i will try 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.690
 find i already shot there this shop with 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.800
 That shelf I just give a link with us 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.470
 there is locally 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:57.010
 such a small Russian store here 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:59.530
 from there but to san francisco for example if 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:02.260
 watch this hour from us 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:05.350
 there is a couple none there is 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:08.619
 a couple of Russian pharmacies is full 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:11.590
 full-scale pharmacy where just well 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.630
 istanbul missionary people pass there 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.910
 the staff speaks Russian and the owners 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.920
 Accordingly, our something to flow nicks and them 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.070
 just there it is convenient that is a pharmacy 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.600
 and no different in the sense 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.310
 prescribed drugs for any 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.440
 American then this is all you need 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.240
 would need to get in american 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.000
 just Russian service is convenient and 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:35.290
 but there are a lot of drugs in particular 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.230
 who are from Russia there from Ukraine the window is not 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:41.110
 habitual to us from the homeland and medicines it 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.410
 common thing is in all places where 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.780
 lives 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.930
 many of our compatriots are there 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.130
 such pharmacies or it will be there stinkers 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.990
 it will be either 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:57.140
 I kiss the big pharmacy here and they 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:59.270
 will be ordered there happily 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.390
 young man he kinda says that 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:04.610
 Here I do not like the doctors who it is 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:08.000
 where I live they are mercenary they are there 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:10.010
 benefit and marvel not at how well this 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.200
 tonic is not it manifested in life there with 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:15.740
 prescribed medication as it is related but 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:18.050
 we have so many doctors who 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.910
 your fellow countrymen especially again 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.280
 big cities where there are many pensioners 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:25.400
 they love to be treated there and so on with them 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.890
 good medicare insurance such 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.780
 state santa pays well now 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.760
 It can be so good as it was 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.470
 maybe you will continue to be so good 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.230
 as now we will see but in every 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.330
 case they have medical insurance, doctors 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.640
 these are stash insurance many wild 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.710
 that cover what is not covering 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.760
 there it is the most decker i have it 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:49.930
 such communism can say such 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:53.030
 polyclinic pharmacy that's why 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.770
 There are many Russian doctors 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:58.070
 the clientele of which are these older ones 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:00.350
 people and accordingly they got used to 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:02.780
 the fact that you have written to him that he 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.780
 says you need me either he 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:08.330
 just go to the other he will be discharged 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:10.790
 so I, in general, have repeatedly 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.650
 heard stories like these oldies like 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.080
 they just manipulate the doctors she doesn't 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:18.489
 shit me write down this is what's with him 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:21.290
 if it does not contradict there 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:24.560
 by law or there for what licenses deprive 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:26.420
 he will pay fees to him so if you 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.150
 will need some medicine 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:31.220
 which can be obtained by prescription means 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.200
 you will write a recipe you have problems with 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:36.440
 the recipe will definitely not be i just want 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:39.190
 add to this that all the same 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.640
 there is a lot of medicine there is a whole empire 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.830
 pharmaceutical united states 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:45.980
 therefore not excluded 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:48.670
 it is possible that you are a doctor here especially 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:52.600
 the doctor who here comes from 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:56.200
 the USSR will choose a good medicine 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.200
 painkillers you enjoy
