Forest camera taken earlier today you

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.529 
Forest camera taken earlier today you
could<00:00:43.710> see<00:00:43.890> those<00:00:44.100> low-lying<00:00:44.730> clouds<00:00:45.059> that

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
could see those low-lying clouds that

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.810 
could see those low-lying clouds that
rolled<00:00:45.930> in<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.649> that's<00:00:46.860> what<00:00:47.190> gave<00:00:47.520> us<00:00:47.670> that

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
rolled in and that's what gave us that

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.029 
rolled in and that's what gave us that
drizzle<00:00:48.210> this<00:00:48.450> morning<00:00:48.510> so<00:00:49.379> we<00:00:49.680> are<00:00:49.800> seeing

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
drizzle this morning so we are seeing

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.250 
drizzle this morning so we are seeing
some<00:00:50.190> sunshine<00:00:50.579> later<00:00:51.270> into<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.719> week<00:00:51.809> but<00:00:52.170> we

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
some sunshine later into the week but we

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.330 
some sunshine later into the week but we
first<00:00:52.530> have<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.739> deal<00:00:52.980> with<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.219> cold

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
first have to deal with the cold

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.979 
first have to deal with the cold
temperatures<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:54.210> that's<00:00:54.329> because<00:00:54.690> of<00:00:54.840> these

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
temperatures and that's because of these

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.040 
temperatures and that's because of these
thick<00:00:55.320> clouds<00:00:55.680> but<00:00:56.399> finally<00:00:57.030> over<00:00:57.270> LAX<00:00:57.809> you

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
thick clouds but finally over LAX you

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.930 
thick clouds but finally over LAX you
can<00:00:58.170> see<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.469> roads<00:00:58.739> are<00:00:59.039> drying<00:00:59.370> out<00:00:59.670> it's

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
can see the roads are drying out it's

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.970 
can see the roads are drying out it's
not<00:01:00.270> as<00:01:00.480> wet<00:01:00.750> that's<00:01:01.230> because<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.739> clouds

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
not as wet that's because the clouds

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.490 
not as wet that's because the clouds
have<00:01:02.340> lifted<00:01:02.370> as<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.600> happens<00:01:04.019> towards<00:01:04.260> the

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
have lifted as that happens towards the

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.679 
have lifted as that happens towards the
afternoon<00:01:04.979> we'll<00:01:05.220> be<00:01:05.250> drying<00:01:05.700> out<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.210> on<00:01:06.570> the

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
afternoon we'll be drying out and on the

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.359 
afternoon we'll be drying out and on the
relative<00:01:07.080> humidity<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:07.619> can<00:01:07.770> see<00:01:07.950> exactly

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
relative humidity you can see exactly

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.240 
relative humidity you can see exactly
where<00:01:08.820> you<00:01:09.060> could<00:01:09.210> see<00:01:09.390> some<00:01:09.420> sunshine<00:01:10.250> 77%

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
where you could see some sunshine 77%

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.000 
where you could see some sunshine 77%
relative<00:01:11.850> humidity<00:01:12.689> in<00:01:12.869> Palmdale<00:01:13.470> so<00:01:13.979> a

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
relative humidity in Palmdale so a

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.160 
relative humidity in Palmdale so a
little<00:01:14.250> bit<00:01:14.490> of<00:01:14.670> sunshine<00:01:14.970> there<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.720> then

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
little bit of sunshine there and then

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.950 
little bit of sunshine there and then
also<00:01:16.409> Big<00:01:17.009> Bear<00:01:17.250> 33<00:01:18.240> percent<00:01:18.750> relative

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
also Big Bear 33 percent relative

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.840 
also Big Bear 33 percent relative
humidity<00:01:19.229> so<00:01:20.070> we're<00:01:20.189> seeing<00:01:20.340> some<00:01:20.580> sunshine

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
humidity so we're seeing some sunshine

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.090 
humidity so we're seeing some sunshine
in<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.240> mountains<00:01:21.570> as<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.259> can<00:01:22.409> see<00:01:22.619> most<00:01:22.890> of

in the mountains as you can see most of

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.800 
in the mountains as you can see most of
the<00:01:23.220> valleys<00:01:23.580> west<00:01:24.150> of<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.509> mountains

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
the valleys west of the mountains

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.810 
the valleys west of the mountains
towards<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.500> ocean<00:01:25.920> we're<00:01:26.310> still<00:01:26.580> seeing

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
towards the ocean we're still seeing

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.359 
towards the ocean we're still seeing
those<00:01:26.939> low-lying<00:01:27.420> clouds<00:01:27.720> so<00:01:28.439> slowly<00:01:28.920> some

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
those low-lying clouds so slowly some

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.620 
those low-lying clouds so slowly some
clearing<00:01:29.820> for<00:01:30.090> today

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630

big<00:01:44.189> changes<00:01:44.729> but<00:01:44.909> first<00:01:45.270> we<00:01:45.540> had<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:45.899> deal

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
big changes but first we had to deal

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.080 
big changes but first we had to deal
with<00:01:46.110> this<00:01:46.500> all<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:46.890> clouds<00:01:47.520> streaming

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
with this all the clouds streaming

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.240 
with this all the clouds streaming
through<00:01:48.479> from<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:49.079> West<00:01:49.320> so<00:01:49.680> we<00:01:49.799> did<00:01:49.979> see<00:01:50.220> some

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
through from the West so we did see some

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.030 
through from the West so we did see some
wet<00:01:50.700> conditions<00:01:51.299> this<00:01:51.509> morning<00:01:51.780> some<00:01:52.380> drizzly

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
weather and that's gonna slowly fade

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.219 
weather and that's gonna slowly fade
away<00:01:55.799> so<00:01:56.369> we've<00:01:56.850> dealt<00:01:57.210> with<00:01:57.329> this<00:01:57.659> all<00:01:57.899> week

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
away so we've dealt with this all week

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.620 
away so we've dealt with this all week
long<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.740> winds<00:01:59.219> picked<00:01:59.520> up<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.909> storms<00:02:00.390> came

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
long the winds picked up the storms came

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.139 
long the winds picked up the storms came
through<00:02:01.020> but<00:02:01.500> now<00:02:01.770> it's<00:02:02.159> all<00:02:02.369> about<00:02:02.579> area<00:02:03.090> of

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
through but now it's all about area of

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.999 
through but now it's all about area of
high<00:02:03.329> pressure<00:02:03.659> will<00:02:03.869> be<00:02:03.990> building<00:02:04.020> in<00:02:04.710> from

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
high pressure will be building in from

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.950 
high pressure will be building in from
the<00:02:05.040> Pacific<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:06.030> you<00:02:06.299> can<00:02:06.450> notice<00:02:06.719> what<00:02:06.869> it

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
the Pacific and you can notice what it

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.540 
the Pacific and you can notice what it
does<00:02:06.990> to<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.409> jet<00:02:07.680> stream<00:02:08.009> as<00:02:08.160> that<00:02:08.310> high

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
does to the jet stream as that high

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.520 
does to the jet stream as that high
builds<00:02:08.970> in<00:02:09.119> you<00:02:09.509> can<00:02:09.660> see<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.810> jet<00:02:10.229> stream<00:02:10.500> is

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
builds in you can see the jet stream is

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.860 
builds in you can see the jet stream is
gonna<00:02:10.770> be<00:02:10.860> well<00:02:11.099> amplified<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.180> north

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
gonna be well amplified to the north

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.930 
gonna be well amplified to the north
and<00:02:12.989> that<00:02:13.140> means<00:02:13.470> warmer<00:02:14.190> temperatures<00:02:14.670> are

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
and that means warmer temperatures are

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.930 
and that means warmer temperatures are
on<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.300> way<00:02:15.420> a<00:02:15.540> big<00:02:16.290> warm-up<00:02:16.769> on<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.069> way<00:02:17.220> take

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
on the way a big warm-up on the way take

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.640 
on the way a big warm-up on the way take
a<00:02:17.970> look<00:02:18.180> at<00:02:18.269> temperatures<00:02:18.569> for<00:02:18.930> today<00:02:19.080> only<00:02:19.590> in
