00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:25.160 
down and because this is not exactly

another pigtail on the other side just a

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.470 
another pigtail on the other side just a
little<00:03:07.820> bit<00:03:08.239> of<00:03:08.510> it<00:03:08.750> poking<00:03:09.470> out<00:03:09.590> as<00:03:10.360> for<00:03:11.360> her

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.270 
little bit of it poking out as for her
body<00:03:11.660> I'm<00:03:12.020> going<00:03:12.140> to<00:03:12.200> draw<00:03:12.440> tiny<00:03:13.130> little

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
body I'm going to draw tiny little

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:21.010 
body I'm going to draw tiny little
triangle<00:03:13.820> for<00:03:14.030> the<00:03:14.090> neck<00:03:14.270> part<00:03:17.770> and<00:03:19.690> her<00:03:20.690> arm

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.020 
triangle for the neck part and her arm

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:28.220 
triangle for the neck part and her arm
is<00:03:21.440> like<00:03:22.370> a<00:03:22.430> rectangle<00:03:23.270> or<00:03:23.420> triangle

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.140 

and<00:03:28.709> she's<00:03:29.310> going<00:03:29.459> to<00:03:29.520> be<00:03:29.640> holding<00:03:29.849> her<00:03:30.090> pillow

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
and she's going to be holding her pillow

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.830 
and she's going to be holding her pillow
so<00:03:33.150> the<00:03:33.300> pillow<00:03:33.540> is<00:03:33.780> quite<00:03:34.110> round<00:03:35.569> but<00:03:36.569> it<00:03:36.690> also

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
so the pillow is quite round but it also

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.860 
so the pillow is quite round but it also
does<00:03:37.650> look<00:03:37.950> quite<00:03:38.310> squarish<00:03:38.910> too<00:03:39.239> so<00:03:39.690> let's

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
does look quite squarish too so let's

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.740 
does look quite squarish too so let's
just<00:03:40.080> use<00:03:40.319> curved<00:03:40.769> lines<00:03:41.069> to<00:03:41.280> draw<00:03:41.430> a<00:03:41.790> rounded

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
just use curved lines to draw a rounded

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.759 
just use curved lines to draw a rounded
square<00:03:43.220> and<00:03:45.050> it's<00:03:46.050> a<00:03:46.110> good<00:03:46.260> idea<00:03:46.440> to<00:03:46.560> draw

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
square and it's a good idea to draw
