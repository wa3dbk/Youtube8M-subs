00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.860 
pretty good-looking phone I'm not gonna
lie<00:00:43.860> it<00:00:44.610> has<00:00:44.789> some<00:00:45.000> nice<00:00:45.210> hardware<00:00:45.660> on<00:00:45.780> the

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
lie it has some nice hardware on the

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.990 
lie it has some nice hardware on the
outside<00:00:46.320> it's<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.620> relatively<00:00:47.100> clean<00:00:47.670> looking

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
outside it's a relatively clean looking

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.090 
outside it's a relatively clean looking
device<00:00:48.329> some<00:00:48.690> pretty<00:00:48.930> relatively<00:00:49.620> square

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
device some pretty relatively square

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.790 
device some pretty relatively square
edges<00:00:50.610> it<00:00:51.000> has<00:00:51.090> capacitive<00:00:51.840> home<00:00:52.079> back<00:00:52.530> and

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
edges it has capacitive home back and

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.740 
edges it has capacitive home back and
multitasking<00:00:53.370> buttons<00:00:53.730> on<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.969> front<00:00:54.120> but<00:00:54.660> of

multitasking buttons on the front but of

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.660 
multitasking buttons on the front but of
course<00:00:54.960> those<00:00:55.199> would<00:00:55.410> disappear<00:00:55.920> in<00:00:56.129> favour

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
course those would disappear in favour

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.150 
course those would disappear in favour
of<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:57.149> larger<00:00:57.600> screen<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.140> if<00:00:58.590> it's<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.800> nexus

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
of a larger screen and if it's a nexus

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.560 
of a larger screen and if it's a nexus
that<00:00:59.280> should<00:00:59.430> have<00:00:59.550> those<00:00:59.730> on-screen<00:01:00.270> buttons

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
that should have those on-screen buttons

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.599 
that should have those on-screen buttons
like<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.260> previous<00:01:01.530> Nexus<00:01:01.920> did<00:01:02.129> people<00:01:02.460> don't

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
like the previous Nexus did people don't

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.670 
like the previous Nexus did people don't
really<00:01:02.820> notice<00:01:03.000> this<00:01:03.270> but<00:01:03.539> LG<00:01:03.719> has<00:01:04.140> actually

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
really notice this but LG has actually

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.740 
really notice this but LG has actually
consistently<00:01:05.250> put<00:01:05.489> really<00:01:06.000> good<00:01:06.180> hardware<00:01:06.630> in

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
consistently put really good hardware in

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.359 
consistently put really good hardware in
the<00:01:06.869> devices<00:01:07.140> it's<00:01:07.680> just<00:01:07.860> kind<00:01:08.010> of<00:01:08.040> held<00:01:08.280> back

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
the devices it's just kind of held back

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.030 
the devices it's just kind of held back
by<00:01:08.729> their<00:01:09.000> so-so<00:01:09.689> software<00:01:10.320> people<00:01:10.740> like

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
by their so-so software people like

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.850 
by their so-so software people like
TouchWiz<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.939> people<00:01:12.180> like<00:01:12.479> Sense<00:01:13.140> UI<00:01:13.439> and

TouchWiz and people like Sense UI and
Motorola<00:01:14.340> skin<00:01:14.790> but<00:01:15.270> LG's<00:01:15.659> skin<00:01:15.990> has<00:01:16.140> been

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
Motorola skin but LG's skin has been

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.740 
Motorola skin but LG's skin has been
clunky<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.610> little<00:01:17.850> bit<00:01:17.939> unintuitive<00:01:18.180> for

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
so this is sort of a back of the thing

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.119 
so this is sort of a back of the thing
for<00:02:09.299> me<00:02:09.390> but<00:02:09.599> it's<00:02:10.170> possible<00:02:10.679> and<00:02:10.860> on<00:02:10.950> top<00:02:11.099> of

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
for me but it's possible and on top of

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.949
