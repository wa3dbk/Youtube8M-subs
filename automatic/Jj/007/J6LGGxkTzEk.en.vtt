figures bad um you seen my ratchet view

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.960 
figures bad um you seen my ratchet view
they're<00:01:46.380> basically<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.860> same<00:01:46.950> thing<00:01:47.460> but

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
they're basically the same thing but

they're basically the same thing but
Ironhide<00:01:48.750> I<00:01:49.939> mean<00:01:51.049> they're<00:01:52.049> based<00:01:52.229> on<00:01:52.439> the

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
Ironhide I mean they're based on the

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.929 
Ironhide I mean they're based on the
same<00:01:52.710> mole<00:01:52.979> because<00:01:53.280> they<00:01:53.399> transform<00:01:53.850> into

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
same mole because they transform into

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.030 
same mole because they transform into
the<00:01:54.090> same<00:01:54.240> thing<00:01:54.540> this<00:01:55.200> transforms<00:01:55.649> into<00:01:55.950> a

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
the same thing this transforms into a

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.380 
the same thing this transforms into a
van<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:57.149> hippie<00:01:57.570> van<00:01:58.460> he<00:01:59.460> has<00:01:59.579> hippies<00:02:00.060> in<00:02:00.090> the

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
rolls the same same articulation just

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.470 
rolls the same same articulation just

different pain um start the

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.880 
different pain um start the
transformation<00:02:15.870> then<00:02:16.110> they<00:02:16.230> actually<00:02:16.590> take

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
transformation then they actually take

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:23.540

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
his windshield I think that's it a

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.150 
his windshield I think that's it a
little<00:02:57.780> bit<00:02:57.959> of<00:02:58.079> paint<00:02:58.290> where<00:02:58.500> but<00:02:58.829> other<00:02:59.010> than

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
little bit of paint where but other than

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.120 
little bit of paint where but other than
that<00:02:59.250> it's<00:02:59.549> nice<00:03:00.500> like<00:03:01.500> I<00:03:01.620> said<00:03:01.680> about<00:03:01.980> the

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
that it's nice like I said about the

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.430 
that it's nice like I said about the
windshield<00:03:02.910> the<00:03:03.060> sticker<00:03:03.360> being<00:03:03.690> his<00:03:03.900> head<00:03:04.140> it

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
windshield the sticker being his head it

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.910 
windshield the sticker being his head it
just<00:03:04.470> looks<00:03:04.950> awful<00:03:05.959> and<00:03:06.959> like<00:03:07.319> I<00:03:07.470> said<00:03:07.530> the

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
just looks awful and like I said the

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.379 
just looks awful and like I said the
whole<00:03:08.069> tradition<00:03:08.579> of<00:03:08.700> whatever<00:03:09.060> it<00:03:09.209> comes

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:09.389 
whole tradition of whatever it comes

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:11.590 
whole tradition of whatever it comes
with<00:03:09.540> a<00:03:09.600> trailer<00:03:10.019> and<00:03:10.230> it's<00:03:10.410> g<00:03:10.680> one<00:03:10.950> that's<00:03:11.220> bad

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
with a trailer and it's g one that's bad

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.849 
with a trailer and it's g one that's bad
that's<00:03:12.600> my<00:03:12.810> motto<00:03:13.049> um<00:03:15.590> really<00:03:16.590> only

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
that's my motto um really only

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:18.500 
that's my motto um really only
articulation<00:03:17.760> you're<00:03:17.910> going<00:03:18.090> to<00:03:18.150> get<00:03:18.299> is

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
articulation you're going to get is

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.520 
articulation you're going to get is
probably<00:03:18.900> in<00:03:19.019> his<00:03:19.139> arms<00:03:19.620> his<00:03:20.130> legs<00:03:21.019> none<00:03:22.019> but

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
probably in his arms his legs none but

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.370 
probably in his arms his legs none but
the<00:03:22.829> feet<00:03:23.160> I<00:03:23.430> mean<00:03:23.970> they're<00:03:24.269> diecast<00:03:24.810> it's

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
the feet I mean they're diecast it's

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.340 
the feet I mean they're diecast it's
nice<00:03:26.389> could<00:03:27.389> have<00:03:27.480> been<00:03:27.540> plastic<00:03:28.109> it<00:03:28.230> could

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
nice could have been plastic it could

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.809 
nice could have been plastic it could
have<00:03:28.440> been<00:03:28.500> worse<00:03:28.850> and<00:03:30.260> I<00:03:31.260> actually<00:03:32.010> found<00:03:32.609> out

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 
have been worse and I actually found out

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:35.900 
have been worse and I actually found out
a<00:03:32.850> little<00:03:33.000> trick<00:03:33.540> if<00:03:34.160> you<00:03:35.160> take<00:03:35.430> this<00:03:35.609> gun

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
a little trick if you take this gun

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.229 
a little trick if you take this gun
right<00:03:36.180> here<00:03:36.209> I<00:03:37.370> don't<00:03:38.370> know<00:03:38.459> if<00:03:38.579> this<00:03:38.760> is<00:03:38.790> what

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
right here I don't know if this is what

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.390 
right here I don't know if this is what
you're<00:03:39.359> supposed<00:03:39.569> to<00:03:39.959> do<00:03:40.139> but<00:03:41.040> it<00:03:41.220> actually

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
you're supposed to do but it actually

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.640 
you're supposed to do but it actually
does<00:03:41.819> fit<00:03:42.239> into<00:03:42.540> his<00:03:42.720> little<00:03:42.959> peg<00:03:43.170> hole<00:03:43.410> there

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
does fit into his little peg hole there

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.710 
does fit into his little peg hole there
so<00:03:44.519> you<00:03:44.579> can<00:03:45.060> make<00:03:45.269> it<00:03:45.480> so<00:03:47.180> Ironhide<00:03:48.180> is<00:03:48.450> kind

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
so you can make it so Ironhide is kind

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.720 
so you can make it so Ironhide is kind
of<00:03:48.840> shooting<00:03:49.319> at<00:03:49.470> oncoming<00:03:49.889> enemies<00:03:50.130> I<00:03:50.519> don't

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
of shooting at oncoming enemies I don't

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.150 
of shooting at oncoming enemies I don't
know<00:03:50.849> looks<00:03:51.660> pretty<00:03:51.810> nice<00:03:52.079> the<00:03:52.829> reason<00:03:53.099> for

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
know looks pretty nice the reason for

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.710 
know looks pretty nice the reason for
why<00:03:53.310> I<00:03:53.340> didn't<00:03:53.609> display<00:03:53.880> what<00:03:54.120> ranches<00:03:54.480> cuz

clip<00:04:48.000> them<00:04:48.150> down<00:04:48.420> like<00:04:49.050> so<00:04:49.470> if<00:04:50.340> you<00:04:50.520> have<00:04:50.670> a

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
clip them down like so if you have a

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:54.530 
clip them down like so if you have a
nail<00:04:51.380> take<00:04:52.380> that<00:04:52.560> tread<00:04:53.090> click<00:04:54.090> it<00:04:54.210> so<00:04:54.360> it's

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:54.540 
nail take that tread click it so it's

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.910 
nail take that tread click it so it's
like<00:04:54.660> that<00:04:54.980> and<00:04:55.980> then<00:04:56.160> bring<00:04:56.400> that<00:04:56.580> back<00:04:56.790> up

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:57.920 
like that and then bring that back up

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:08.390 
like that and then bring that back up
and<00:05:04.070> there's<00:05:05.070> this<00:05:05.190> trailer<00:05:05.640> and<00:05:06.860> think<00:05:07.860> if<00:05:08.310> i

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
and there's this trailer and think if i

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.590 
and there's this trailer and think if i
look<00:05:08.550> in<00:05:08.730> the<00:05:08.850> box<00:05:09.920> yep<00:05:11.300> one<00:05:12.300> of<00:05:12.450> these

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600 
look in the box yep one of these

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.960 
look in the box yep one of these
missiles<00:05:13.080> is<00:05:13.200> stolen<00:05:13.560> tree<00:05:14.040> the<00:05:14.550> other<00:05:14.580> one

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
missiles is stolen tree the other one

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.780 
missiles is stolen tree the other one
came<00:05:15.810> out<00:05:15.870> during<00:05:16.350> storage<00:05:16.770> i<00:05:17.010> did<00:05:17.250> have<00:05:17.430> both

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:17.790 
came out during storage i did have both

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:20.240 
came out during storage i did have both
of<00:05:18.000> them<00:05:18.150> on<00:05:18.300> the<00:05:18.420> tree<00:05:18.720> but<00:05:19.620> i<00:05:19.650> just<00:05:20.040> fell<00:05:20.220> off

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
of them on the tree but i just fell off

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.940 
of them on the tree but i just fell off
i<00:05:20.640> don't<00:05:20.670> know<00:05:20.880> and<00:05:21.240> same<00:05:21.960> thing<00:05:21.990> let<00:05:22.920> me

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:22.950 
i don't know and same thing let me

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:26.420 
i don't know and same thing let me
actually<00:05:23.300> take<00:05:24.300> this<00:05:24.510> off<00:05:24.750> right<00:05:25.320> here<00:05:26.250> this

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
actually take this off right here this

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:31.750 
actually take this off right here this
piece<00:05:26.670> and<00:05:27.140> just<00:05:28.140> plug<00:05:28.710> it<00:05:28.890> in<00:05:29.040> to<00:05:29.760> his<00:05:29.940> hole

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:31.760 
piece and just plug it in to his hole

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:37.580 
piece and just plug it in to his hole
like<00:05:32.760> so<00:05:32.900> think<00:05:33.900> let<00:05:34.260> me<00:05:34.350> see<00:05:36.050> it's<00:05:37.050> supposed

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:37.590 
like so think let me see it's supposed

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:41.930 
like so think let me see it's supposed
to<00:05:37.680> go<00:05:37.830> i<00:05:37.860> think<00:05:38.190> i<00:05:38.250> have<00:05:38.280> it<00:05:38.550> backwards<00:05:40.940> when

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 
to go i think i have it backwards when

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.240 
to go i think i have it backwards when
it<00:05:42.060> does<00:05:42.630> the<00:05:42.840> same<00:05:42.870> thing<00:05:43.320> basically<00:05:43.560> and

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
it does the same thing basically and

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:45.950 
it does the same thing basically and
then<00:05:44.280> you're<00:05:45.030> going<00:05:45.120> to<00:05:45.180> take<00:05:45.240> the<00:05:45.510> iron<00:05:45.750> high

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 
then you're going to take the iron high

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:56.150 
then you're going to take the iron high
figure<00:05:46.350> I'll<00:05:46.770> just<00:05:46.830> plug<00:05:47.580> them<00:05:47.700> in

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:56.160 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:02.190 

if<00:05:57.160> you<00:05:57.280> will<00:05:57.490> plug<00:05:57.820> in<00:05:58.000> log<00:05:58.630> oh<00:06:01.170> one<00:06:02.170> thing

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:02.200 
if you will plug in log oh one thing

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.770 
if you will plug in log oh one thing
this<00:06:02.890> figure<00:06:03.310> and<00:06:03.520> along<00:06:03.760> the<00:06:03.880> most<00:06:04.090> these

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:04.780 
this figure and along the most these

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:07.490 
this figure and along the most these
treads<00:06:05.230> have<00:06:05.590> a<00:06:05.620> tendency<00:06:06.370> of<00:06:06.400> coming<00:06:06.850> off

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:07.500 
treads have a tendency of coming off

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.230 
treads have a tendency of coming off
that's<00:06:08.500> why<00:06:08.710> the<00:06:09.340> transformation<00:06:10.030> for<00:06:10.210> the

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:10.240 
that's why the transformation for the

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.330 
that's why the transformation for the
treads<00:06:10.540> that<00:06:11.230> I<00:06:11.260> did<00:06:11.560> that's<00:06:11.890> why<00:06:12.040> I<00:06:12.070> did<00:06:12.310> it

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:12.340 
treads that I did that's why I did it

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.280 
treads that I did that's why I did it
that<00:06:12.580> way<00:06:12.760> but<00:06:12.820> they<00:06:13.240> can<00:06:13.420> easily<00:06:13.870> plug<00:06:14.050> back

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:14.290 
that way but they can easily plug back

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:15.840 
that way but they can easily plug back
in<00:06:14.470> but<00:06:14.650> they're<00:06:14.800> just<00:06:14.980> really<00:06:15.190> simple<00:06:15.820> to

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:15.850 
in but they're just really simple to

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:21.210 
in but they're just really simple to
loose<00:06:18.090> and<00:06:19.230> that's<00:06:20.230> Ironhide<00:06:20.770> in<00:06:21.070> his

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:21.220 
loose and that's Ironhide in his

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:23.340 
loose and that's Ironhide in his
complete<00:06:21.670> robot<00:06:22.090> mode<00:06:22.300> now<00:06:22.900> one<00:06:23.110> thing<00:06:23.140> I

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:23.350 
complete robot mode now one thing I

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:24.930 
complete robot mode now one thing I
didn't<00:06:23.590> mention<00:06:23.650> in<00:06:23.980> the<00:06:24.070> ratchet<00:06:24.430> video<00:06:24.700> is

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:24.940 
didn't mention in the ratchet video is

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:31.770 
didn't mention in the ratchet video is

colors but for some reason they were
when<00:06:44.620> they<00:06:44.650> were<00:06:45.640> similar<00:06:46.420> to<00:06:46.600> the<00:06:46.720> movies

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:47.220

little fact um now for some reason
Ironhide<00:07:05.830> retails<00:07:06.400> more<00:07:06.910> than<00:07:07.210> ratchet<00:07:07.750> when

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:08.710 
Ironhide retails more than ratchet when

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:09.990 
Ironhide retails more than ratchet when
it<00:07:08.830> comes<00:07:09.010> to<00:07:09.160> the<00:07:09.250> original<00:07:09.610> so<00:07:09.820> what<00:07:09.970> I

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:10.000 
it comes to the original so what I

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.490 
it comes to the original so what I
recommend<00:07:10.090> doing<00:07:10.630> is<00:07:10.840> probably<00:07:11.110> getting<00:07:11.290> the

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:11.500 
recommend doing is probably getting the

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:17.790 
recommend doing is probably getting the
Encore<00:07:12.340> version<00:07:12.880> and<00:07:14.940> um<00:07:16.410> that's<00:07:17.410> pretty<00:07:17.680> much

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:17.800 
Encore version and um that's pretty much

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:22.490 
Encore version and um that's pretty much
it<00:07:17.860> um<00:07:19.050> beside<00:07:20.050> that<00:07:20.350> it's<00:07:20.620> a<00:07:20.830> like<00:07:21.670> I<00:07:21.850> said

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:22.500 
it um beside that it's a like I said

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.620 
it um beside that it's a like I said
okay<00:07:23.500> figure<00:07:24.010> same<00:07:24.490> thing<00:07:24.730> we're<00:07:24.880> at<00:07:25.060> but<00:07:25.570> a

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:25.630 
okay figure same thing we're at but a

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:32.010 
okay figure same thing we're at but a
ratchet<00:07:27.270> three<00:07:28.270> out<00:07:28.720> of<00:07:28.840> ten<00:07:29.940> maybe<00:07:30.940> it's<00:07:31.810> not

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:32.020 
ratchet three out of ten maybe it's not
