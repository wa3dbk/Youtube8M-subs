and so yeah pretty much you rush and
it's<00:00:43.290> a<00:00:43.350> very<00:00:43.379> good<00:00:43.950> tip<00:00:44.250> too<00:00:45.210> um<00:00:45.649> if<00:00:46.649> you<00:00:46.980> just

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
it's a very good tip too um if you just

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.049 
it's a very good tip too um if you just
aim<00:00:48.360> just<00:00:48.660> shoot<00:00:49.379> from<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.559> hip<00:00:49.829> if<00:00:50.070> you<00:00:50.250> don't

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
aim just shoot from the hip if you don't

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.700 
aim just shoot from the hip if you don't
have<00:00:51.180> time<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.570> aim<00:00:51.690> down<00:00:51.809> sight<00:00:52.079> because

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
have time to aim down sight because

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.220 
have time to aim down sight because
shooting<00:00:53.160> from<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.340> hip<00:00:53.430> it's<00:00:54.059> great<00:00:54.930> because

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
shooting from the hip it's great because

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.229 
shooting from the hip it's great because
the<00:00:55.379> crosshairs<00:00:55.800> are<00:00:55.949> so<00:00:56.219> close<00:00:57.059> together

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
the crosshairs are so close together

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.610 
the crosshairs are so close together
with<00:00:57.719> them<00:00:58.520> missed<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.640> game<00:01:00.050> on<00:01:01.050> this<00:01:01.440> and

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620
