horse again there's been probably five
horses<00:00:35.210> I<00:00:35.510> think<00:00:35.960> they<00:00:36.290> do<00:00:36.350> three<00:00:36.890> dates<00:00:37.100> that

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
horses I think they do three dates that

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.310 
horses I think they do three dates that
you<00:00:37.550> know<00:00:37.670> you<00:00:37.730> really<00:00:38.150> feel<00:00:38.420> that<00:00:38.750> when<00:00:39.260> you

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
you know you really feel that when you

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.250 
you know you really feel that when you
sit<00:00:39.910> the<00:00:40.910> horse<00:00:41.120> is<00:00:41.330> still<00:00:41.540> moving<00:00:41.720> the<00:00:42.050> same

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
sit the horse is still moving the same

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.799 
sit the horse is still moving the same
still<00:00:43.220> swinging<00:00:43.580> in<00:00:43.790> the<00:00:43.820> back<00:00:44.059> and<00:00:45.460> this<00:00:46.460> is<00:00:46.670> a

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:46.809 
still swinging in the back and this is a

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:53.250 
still swinging in the back and this is a
horse<00:00:47.809> is<00:00:48.020> strong<00:00:48.290> enough<00:00:48.470> to<00:00:48.530> do<00:00:48.739> them

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.729 

that's<00:00:54.260> why<00:00:54.470> I<00:00:54.500> don't<00:00:54.830> sit<00:00:55.159> on<00:00:55.460> every<00:00:56.449> course

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
that's why I don't sit on every course

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:58.720 
that's why I don't sit on every course
because<00:00:57.739> I<00:00:57.800> just<00:00:57.980> feel<00:00:58.159> that<00:00:58.339> some<00:00:58.550> of<00:00:58.580> the

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
because I just feel that some of the

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.990 
because I just feel that some of the
horses<00:00:59.059> are<00:00:59.690> too<00:00:59.900> stiff<00:01:00.230> in<00:01:00.379> the<00:01:00.409> back<00:01:01.000> it's

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
horses are too stiff in the back it's

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.899 
horses are too stiff in the back it's
not<00:01:02.210> just<00:01:02.420> because<00:01:02.659> I<00:01:02.780> don't<00:01:02.839> want<00:01:03.199> to<00:01:03.290> sit

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:03.909 
not just because I don't want to sit

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:05.170 
not just because I don't want to sit
sittings

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
sittings

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:12.600 
sittings
fine<00:01:06.940> if<00:01:07.940> the<00:01:08.150> boss<00:01:08.300> is<00:01:08.630> in<00:01:09.170> loose<00:01:09.380> enough<00:01:09.680> so

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:18.070 

this<00:01:13.610> is<00:01:14.380> again<00:01:15.380> a<00:01:15.770> very<00:01:16.520> relaxed<00:01:16.909> holes<00:01:17.210> in

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
this is again a very relaxed holes in

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:27.600 
this is again a very relaxed holes in
his<00:01:18.350> body<00:01:19.810> you<00:01:20.810> don't<00:01:20.960> feel<00:01:22.600> any<00:01:23.600> tension

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.580 

again<00:01:28.610> it<00:01:28.729> feels<00:01:28.909> a<00:01:29.240> very<00:01:29.539> big<00:01:29.750> problem<00:01:29.960> that

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
again it feels a very big problem that

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.340 
again it feels a very big problem that
doesn't<00:01:31.399> feel<00:01:31.520> like<00:01:31.670> a<00:01:31.729> writing<00:01:32.149> partner

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
doesn't feel like a writing partner

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:48.359 
doesn't feel like a writing partner
that's<00:01:33.350> for<00:01:33.560> sure

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:52.099 

so<00:01:48.909> we're<00:01:49.060> getting<00:01:49.179> the<00:01:49.329> question<00:01:50.100> I<00:01:51.100> have<00:01:51.789> to

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:52.109 
so we're getting the question I have to

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:58.740 
so we're getting the question I have to
decide<00:01:53.490> it<00:01:55.200> is<00:01:56.200> he<00:01:56.939> reacting<00:01:57.939> you<00:01:58.420> can<00:01:58.600> see

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
decide it is he reacting you can see

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:59.969 
decide it is he reacting you can see
soon<00:01:58.960> as<00:01:59.079> I<00:01:59.140> touch<00:01:59.350> them<00:01:59.469> in<00:01:59.619> my<00:01:59.710> spare<00:01:59.950> a

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
soon as I touch them in my spare a

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.340 
soon as I touch them in my spare a
little<00:02:00.250> bit<00:02:00.369> then<00:02:01.210> his<00:02:01.689> hind<00:02:01.960> legs<00:02:02.020> have

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
little bit then his hind legs have

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:08.339 
little bit then his hind legs have
they're<00:02:03.810> cooperating<00:02:06.420> so<00:02:07.420> it's<00:02:07.689> fine<00:02:07.929> being<00:02:08.229> a

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:08.349 
they're cooperating so it's fine being a

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:10.650 
they're cooperating so it's fine being a
relaxed<00:02:08.769> big<00:02:08.979> horse<00:02:09.250> but<00:02:10.239> he<00:02:10.360> had<00:02:10.509> to<00:02:10.599> have

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
relaxed big horse but he had to have

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:19.589 
relaxed big horse but he had to have
enough<00:02:11.099> blood<00:02:12.099> and<00:02:12.930> nerves<00:02:14.819> reactions<00:02:18.599> and

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
enough blood and nerves reactions and

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.110 
enough blood and nerves reactions and
you<00:02:19.629> know<00:02:19.900> when<00:02:20.140> you<00:02:20.260> ride<00:02:20.670> we<00:02:21.670> always<00:02:21.940> get

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
you know when you ride we always get

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.720 
you know when you ride we always get
told<00:02:22.390> you<00:02:22.810> have<00:02:22.959> to<00:02:23.079> do<00:02:23.230> a<00:02:23.560> lot<00:02:24.220> of<00:02:24.310> transitions

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
told you have to do a lot of transitions

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.589 
told you have to do a lot of transitions
and<00:02:25.349> that's<00:02:26.349> not<00:02:26.530> just<00:02:27.090> walk<00:02:28.090> trot<00:02:28.360> trot

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:28.599 
and that's not just walk trot trot

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:32.280 
and that's not just walk trot trot
canter<00:02:29.280> just<00:02:30.280> different<00:02:30.489> speeds<00:02:31.140> when<00:02:32.140> you're

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
canter just different speeds when you're

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.619 
canter just different speeds when you're
running<00:02:32.849> keep<00:02:33.849> the<00:02:33.970> horse<00:02:34.150> interested<00:02:36.629> and

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:37.629 
running keep the horse interested and

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:39.270 
running keep the horse interested and
he's<00:02:37.780> very<00:02:38.049> nice<00:02:38.349> in<00:02:38.590> the<00:02:38.709> truck<00:02:38.920> might<00:02:39.160> be

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
he's very nice in the truck might be

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:47.730 
he's very nice in the truck might be
action

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.420 

so<00:02:48.310> the<00:02:48.460> Kenton<00:02:49.170> has<00:02:50.170> to<00:02:50.350> just<00:02:50.590> come<00:02:51.160> down<00:02:51.400> a

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
so the Kenton has to just come down a

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.870 
so the Kenton has to just come down a
little<00:02:51.670> more<00:02:51.940> in<00:02:52.720> the<00:02:52.930> crook<00:02:53.460> now<00:02:54.460> you<00:02:54.520> see<00:02:54.790> it

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
little more in the crook now you see it

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:55.800 
little more in the crook now you see it
a<00:02:54.940> little<00:02:55.060> bit<00:02:55.300> here

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
a little bit here

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:03.300 
a little bit here
good<00:02:56.770> rhythm<00:02:57.010> big<00:02:57.820> rhythm<00:02:58.620> definite<00:02:59.620> 3b<00:03:02.310> but

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
good rhythm big rhythm definite 3b but

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.640 
good rhythm big rhythm definite 3b but
it's<00:03:03.460> still<00:03:03.670> to<00:03:04.270> do<00:03:04.480> a<00:03:04.780> little<00:03:05.440> bit<00:03:05.620> with

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
it's still to do a little bit with

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:12.120 
it's still to do a little bit with
straightness<00:03:09.390> now<00:03:10.390> this<00:03:10.570> way<00:03:10.750> you<00:03:10.930> tend<00:03:11.140> to

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
straightness now this way you tend to

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:19.580 
straightness now this way you tend to
curve<00:03:12.370> a<00:03:12.400> little<00:03:12.610> bit<00:03:12.880> to<00:03:13.000> the<00:03:13.090> right

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.530 

and<00:03:20.590> he<00:03:20.740> does<00:03:21.190> easy<00:03:21.400> transitions<00:03:22.150> to<00:03:22.300> his

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
and he does easy transitions to his

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:28.390 
and he does easy transitions to his
favorite<00:03:22.960> cake

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.170 

and<00:03:29.660> again<00:03:30.660> a<00:03:30.690> very<00:03:31.020> big<00:03:31.560> loose<00:03:32.070> this<00:03:32.820> is<00:03:33.000> one

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
and again a very big loose this is one

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.010 
and again a very big loose this is one
of<00:03:33.210> that<00:03:34.370> the<00:03:35.370> biggest<00:03:35.610> walls<00:03:35.940> here<00:03:36.270> again<00:03:36.720> a

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.020 
of that the biggest walls here again a

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.770 
of that the biggest walls here again a
horse<00:03:37.550> you<00:03:38.550> probably<00:03:38.970> looks<00:03:39.210> like<00:03:39.330> it<00:03:39.660> it

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
horse you probably looks like it it

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.210 
horse you probably looks like it it
feels<00:03:40.050> like<00:03:40.320> a<00:03:40.830> horse<00:03:41.580> walking<00:03:42.030> to<00:03:42.180> his<00:03:42.330> body<00:03:42.570> I

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
feels like a horse walking to his body I

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.520 
feels like a horse walking to his body I
think<00:03:44.220> that<00:03:44.400> you<00:03:44.490> have<00:03:44.670> to<00:03:44.790> accept<00:03:45.030> as<00:03:45.270> well

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
think that you have to accept as well

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.350 
think that you have to accept as well
the<00:03:46.530> fact<00:03:46.770> that<00:03:46.830> the<00:03:47.010> big<00:03:47.190> movers<00:03:47.580> take<00:03:48.030> a

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
the fact that the big movers take a

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.040 
the fact that the big movers take a
little<00:03:48.660> bit<00:03:48.780> longer<00:03:48.960> to<00:03:49.380> become<00:03:50.040> lighter<00:03:50.720> so<00:03:51.720> I

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
little bit longer to become lighter so I

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:56.240 
little bit longer to become lighter so I
think<00:03:52.260> that<00:03:52.650> will<00:03:52.830> be<00:03:54.710> thank<00:03:55.710> you

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
think that will be thank you

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.380 
think that will be thank you
I<00:03:56.280> think<00:03:57.180> that<00:03:57.330> is<00:03:57.480> something<00:03:57.870> that<00:03:59.390> develops

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
I think that is something that develops

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:08.360 
I think that is something that develops
when<00:04:01.050> you<00:04:01.200> get<00:04:01.380> more<00:04:06.230> but<00:04:07.230> it's<00:04:07.380> nice<00:04:07.620> again

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
when you get more but it's nice again

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:09.590 
when you get more but it's nice again
you<00:04:08.580> know<00:04:08.700> like<00:04:08.910> I've<00:04:09.060> said<00:04:09.209> some<00:04:09.450> of<00:04:09.540> the

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
you know like I've said some of the

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.340 
you know like I've said some of the
horses<00:04:09.780> you<00:04:10.050> get<00:04:10.230> on<00:04:10.380> and<00:04:10.680> obviously<00:04:11.459> you<00:04:12.030> are

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
horses you get on and obviously you are

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.140 
horses you get on and obviously you are
never<00:04:13.350> rid<00:04:13.560> of<00:04:13.650> them<00:04:13.740> before<00:04:14.010> so<00:04:14.220> you<00:04:14.820> can<00:04:14.850> be<00:04:15.120> a

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
never rid of them before so you can be a

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.520 
never rid of them before so you can be a
little<00:04:15.270> bit<00:04:15.540> apprehensive

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
little bit apprehensive

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.920 
little bit apprehensive
they<00:04:16.650> might<00:04:16.830> not<00:04:16.980> always<00:04:17.190> feel<00:04:17.310> that<00:04:17.930> they're

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
they might not always feel that they're

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.740 
they might not always feel that they're
going<00:04:19.049> to<00:04:19.140> behave<00:04:19.380> most<00:04:19.709> of<00:04:19.859> them<00:04:19.950> have<00:04:20.750> that's

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
going to behave most of them have that's

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.500 
going to behave most of them have that's

I'm up it feels like that and when he's

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:05.999 
I'm up it feels like that and when he's
moving<00:05:04.509> in<00:05:04.749> the<00:05:04.840> war<00:05:04.990> and<00:05:05.229> the<00:05:05.319> canter<00:05:05.770> and
