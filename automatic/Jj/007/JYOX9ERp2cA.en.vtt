00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:12.450
 the training is also on the way 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.020
 the place continues to run relaxed and 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.699
 calmly 

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.130
 the peaceful impression judith has a lot 

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:21.270
 training time cost because that was 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:24.750
 at first I have it different for 2009 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.700
 got in august and there it was 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.640
 actually still relatively difficult so 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:32.820
 to lead the most crudely against bit 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.530
 but to break free broken 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.550
 the others were not so i can 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.550
 just put it on 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.930
 the hardest thing was really that 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.880
 she has become so hysterical 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.290
 restless very fast so one 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.530
 little brought out of the socket 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.899
 has or too much pressure or too little ever 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.600
 after or noises they do not 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.010
 knew this really really fast 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.120
 hectic become restless and man 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.219
 then really hard on her 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.350
 has become of so it will stop 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:06.180
 simply the most work on one 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.979
 itself and the construction of the so 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.000
 said alleys that is definitely 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.070
 job 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.590
 judith first builds a light exercise 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.510
 on how everything is at dual activation 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.400
 in the colors blue and yellow 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.110
 the dual activation goes from the 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.820
 scientific knowledge from that 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.040
 the horse a bad connection 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.049
 between the two brain halves has eight 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.760
 times worse than the human in the 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.310
 wilderness sooner has their survival 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.820
 secured there was rather run than 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.950
 think 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.630
 today it's the other way around 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.490
 want horses left 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.830
 the better the connection between the 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.270
 brain halves the horse left more relaxed 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.189
 so the thesis 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.140
 hence the name of the training method 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.759
 it's all about a better one 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.759
 connection between both brain halves 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.820
 Let's go in step the cash registers should 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.210
 Remember the horse that it always 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.400
 nice to keep the balance now with 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.770
 the dual activation analog works 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.570
 then there are very important rules 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.170
 so to speak to which one should hold oneself 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.509
 and indeed it is enormously important the horse 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.230
 in the streets so while it's through 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:15.239
 Bar is running loose 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.520
 then ask a bit and then again 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.290
 let it relax 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.900
 put means I get my head like that 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.430
 a bit inside now like this 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.290
 little is the time the cup was 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.990
 also good because they are not so 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.130
 can lean against it 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.890
 I show a bit with that 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:34.170
 whip on the shoulder that the outside 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.260
 stay and get my head up now 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.540
 again and read again relaxed in the 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.570
 the horse is really in the streets 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.220
 You can straighten the garden yourself 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.470
 obama has just noticed he 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.690
 learned from dressage horses the 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.960
 are scary in the straight 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.850
 moment was the reference had 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.860
 and as soon as you let them loose 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.180
 they were not straight anymore 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.210
 respectively could easily 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.220
 not just right 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:03.210
 the number two is the dual activation 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.740
 serenity 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:08.010
 the colors are blue and yellow 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.720
 back in the game it's that way 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.760
 horse just is not able or 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.830
 not as intense as we humans 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.570
 Information from one brain half on 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.310
 to transfer the other, that is when 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.710
 you then face again 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:24.030
 looking at the horse and the location of the 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:26.280
 eyes you can see that is also driving 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.980
 I should not be able to see exactly how 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.260
 We just because we are very big area 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.590
 Really with both eyes perceive that 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:37.910
 horse, however, almost in both eyes 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:40.080
 has a different picture that is 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.220
 different information too 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.930
 the brain halves 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.070
 and if I still remember that 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.950
 the information also not 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:48.420
 it can be exchanged 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.030
 almost twice as much, so to speak 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.860
 process and connect this 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.680
 But I can help between the brain 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:58.650
 just train through left right stimuli 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.840
 by optical power thereby the horse 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.790
 easier to process information 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.980
 that brings me now on one side 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.840
 following if I'm a very scary one 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.880
 the horse just got it 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.830
 can handle the situation faster the 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.959
 means it can recognize faster that it 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.100
 just at the tractor not 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:19.060
 horses press just just 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:20.560
 A tractor is just as good as I am 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.830
 but now there is the possibility there 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:27.250
 in the horse as in humans too 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:29.950
 Muscle composition balance is all about hearing 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:33.190
 I'm already in the brain, so to speak 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.870
 create balance and thereby 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.760
 even the horse in the situation is better 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.370
 to use his muscles 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.410
 to run more consciously I have here now 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.470
 just go through the streets again 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.210
 an element around the horses a bit 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.650
 to judge at the same time that is to say 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:51.660
 they should really be one 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:53.890
 optical prop give the horse forward 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.630
 that it just starts itself 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.290
 straighten yourself up 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.720
 judge 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:01.660
 she can replace herself so well 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.370
 means that the balanced 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.140
 It is also quieter from the pace 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.850
 which, so to speak, are no longer afraid 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:08.860
 you have to fall so you know it 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:10.540
 bit of cycling the slow 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.700
 of course, that's a lot more difficult 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.680
 as a result , many tend to be fast 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.270
 horses are always too easy 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.300
 to get faster so as not to fall over 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:21.190
 and of course that's gone already 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.050
 that he is afraid to fall then 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:24.430
 Calms down the pace and 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.310
 you have that with her clearly 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:29.020
 noticed 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:31.210
 at the end of the training session must 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:33.520
 amy the alley still in the trot and canter 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:35.710
 train every gear on every page 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:39.840
 this is important so that the horses are right 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.840
 and evenly balanced on the left
