00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:04.610
 laws 

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:07.610
 the powers 

00:00:11.529 --> 00:00:14.959
 out of the six that he is used to long outings the best frame of 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:19.140
 possible bike and the one that will offer the most return all the time 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.780
 transfer a maximum of vibrations 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:22.369
 the 566 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:24.730
 and designed to face the worst clothes 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.970
 and allow cyclists to ride for a long time in the best conditions 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.970
 everything is done to ensure the best possible comfort 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.430
 for cyclists and the most demanding 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:34.719
 the bazadais on the bench 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:38.050
 his parade with a strong flattening at the center of studies 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.960
 which has two advantages 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:40.960
 First 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.290
 by increasing the width of the tube 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.579
 we improve its lateral stiffness so the transmission of the pedaling force 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.330
 secondly 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.330
 by decreasing tube thickness 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.900
 we create a friction point it is amortized improvement and therefore improves 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.900
 comfort 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.930
 the fork designed on the same principle 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.070
 it presents at this point a decrease of section 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.600
 which allows him to keep an important inflection 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.130
 but that's not all 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.890
 the swell 566 innov 'actually 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.500
 it is that it pushes the concept of trident carbon deformation still 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.610
 further 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.770
 that's why the Italian tax authorities are extra flat 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:21.930
 face this form 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.260
 extra flat 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.640
 the upper tube is able to absorb deformations 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.280
 that we see these elements on this machine and if the solicitations 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.429
 repeated 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:31.800
 up to a hundred thousand times 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.880
 we notice then that it is the case the annuitant who is able to absorb the 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.420
 constraints finally 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.100
 to perfect the comfort 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.640
 it's a seatpost at May 27, 2008 the cervÃ©lo team 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.370
 indeed a rod that saidia meters allows the carbon tubes of 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:47.980
 bend more than 20 millimeters back and forth 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.320
 the larger diameter saddle rods are infinitely stiffer 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.150
 and therefore much less comfortable for all these reasons the 566 alas the 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.150
 most dynamic and comfortable bikes currently on the market 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.170
 if you are told that it is light 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.800
 the thesis framework just over a kilo 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.220
 you will easily understand that this is a bike that is extremely appreciated by 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.280
 cyclists and who make great distances in the region because for them 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.069
 lightness 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.639
 efficiency cine mine better performance
