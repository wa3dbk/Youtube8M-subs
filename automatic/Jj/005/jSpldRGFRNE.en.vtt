00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:09.690
 And also people that you are well 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.559
 coming to another video of the working channel 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.719
 hardware 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.770
 I am the worker lucas and today I bring to 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:21.449
 You guys have more test games on gtx 980 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:23.880
 this time gta5 in full hd and two cars 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.300
 in the last test games I just tested 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.250
 in 4k I had tested on gta5 however 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.309
 some people had been few because 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.399
 you do not do full hd either or 2k you 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.920
 and are resolutions closer to leaving the 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.660
 reality of the Brazilian, because today 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.829
 in days few plates can roll 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:46.379
 with in 4k with a good quality right e 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.899
 full HD is still a resolution 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.399
 used so I believe it to be 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.430
 also interesting to run in this 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:56.430
 even though this board has so much 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.399
 memory or is most suitable for four 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.960
 Cantos steal another car here more 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:03.899
 Let's just say, well. 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.780
 good folks, are you seeing full hd? 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:10.549
 no amount of summer used nearby 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.630
 of 4 GB of memory then you do not have 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:16.560
 problems tell this in this resolution 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:20.460
 is taking in a species rate well 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.900
 nf 74 fps 30 fps show for 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.549
 You the qualities I 'm running 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:28.369
 here only settings 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:33.240
 always gives a light that I do not know why 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:37.650
 look only personal full hd fx a connected ms 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:41.310
 2 x 1 what will you see all the most 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:44.040
 reflexes ms 2 x 1 I left thems only 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.170
 12 x because I believe it already is 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.259
 enough nor people you put in the 4 x 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.020
 xii gets too heavy you do not notice 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:55.350
 difference in the image despite this 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.430
 The difference exists for me 2x already is 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.490
 enough 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.490
 the performance pretty good there in full HD 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:08.160
 Quiet for this plate sign takes the 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:12.030
 du worship very quiet if you do 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:16.530
 overclock performance under well even more 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:19.800
 about 20% beauty the staff will do 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:23.760
 now a quick test on two cars 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.770
 put here but the mouse 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.380
 I do not know what happened to gp. 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.000
 will occupy 1% every time you charge the same 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.190
 This happens, I do not know if it's because I 'm 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.200
 recording with fair play 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:39.060
 Anyway the pa looks just like putting here in 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:44.820
 two cars only on the menu that happens this 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:48.840
 the people pressuring 2,560 for 1,440 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:50.370
 also known as 1449 then observe 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.890
 that the information on the screen become a 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:57.750
 little ones there and summer use already 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:59.519
 He went up there to 4240 then it is recommended 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.069
 for four if you have a card with 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:04.500
 more than 4 GB of RAM is not 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.750
 stay on the edge of hazelnut and that people 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.630
 knows that when you pass the limit you see 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:12.330
 available in tri-text display because 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:15.030
 the game begins to save the information in the 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:20.850
 ram and this can be a problem 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:21.570
 of bottleneck grandson 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.549
 10 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.620
 some people have said there that he has 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:28.440
 made the management better than 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.850
 has been giving so much 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.910
 I did not test because they expect to leave the version 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:36.329
 end but what people are up to 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:38.220
 It's really cool, and one of the 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:41.310
 10 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:45.180
 so the 2k staff to sign it too 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:47.420
 has performance and pretty cool 50 fps with 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.489
 board in stock 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:54.840
 I'm going to take a quick overclock test. 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:57.570
 Look at the fpso for 60 and you look good. 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.519
 Calm down, right overclocked. 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.410
 Some people ask you for me. 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:05.519
 lucas how do you overclock during the 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:11.070
 game was very simple you create files 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:16.049
 It 's free! 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:17.729
 you create the hotkeys la tribune same 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.130
 so you can do a sequence 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:22.440
 key that activates the profile that you 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:25.600
 created then that's what I do not have 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:30.460
 no secret national personal beauty 2 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:32.200
 tranquil super rally also use well 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.850
 below the limit ne 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.070
 I'll put it on 4k for you to see 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:38.050
 as it increases the use of Iran and how that 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.200
 reduces cpu 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.760
 as I explained in one of the videos there 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:45.700
 if the same resolution is playing more 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:48.580
 load for video card using cpu 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:51.570
 falls in the same proportion there was also 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:56.340
 40 and a few percent went to 33%, right? 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:05:00.520
 look at the cpu people 22% looks like dropped cpu 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:02.080
 only you increase the resolution already then 4k 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.060
 now it's very little up there 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:09.730
 I'll tell you the answer from 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:14.220
 gb ram rondônia with 27 and 28 fps 

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:14.220
 This is a cool fps rate . 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:20.650
 it is with that fluidity is right 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:22.390
 giving a few slips here then it would be 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.580
 cool if you were to run in that 

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:27.070
 that you at least reduce a 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:30.370
 bit the settings here is not the case 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:33.490
 I may be reducing before them and for 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:35.410
 example here oms a né is in a 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:38.140
 high resolution have no needs 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:41.320
 to them though in some tests I 

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:45.160
 use but as I explained to you in 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:49.120
 tests there I use seven 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:51.850
 So, everybody, there's a beautiful better. 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.280
 still deactivating angeles is already 36 

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:56.950
 and parties 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:59.620
 then personal op own the run fell 

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:04.930
 very recurrent activated or 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:07.510
 angels there flex ms to initiated x to use ne 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:11.470
 The game is still beautiful, people have a 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:13.960
 visual quality amazing guy play 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:15.970
 this resolution only those who play 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:18.790
 to see what I'm seeing here because the 

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:22.720
 youtube reduces a lot of quality but that 

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:24.970
 incredible thing, serious face, really cool 

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:26.980
 play at that resolution 

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:28.690
 today it is difficult for a video card to keep 

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:31.660
 a good performance running point in the 

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:33.430
 there, who knows in the next generation is 

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:36.400
 Of course if you take two plates here 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:37.969
 this list does not give in 60 fps right there I am 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:41.269
 I have not done this test yet 

00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:42.499
 if he wants to send over 1980 and I do 

00:06:41.269 --> 00:06:45.289
 her sling 

00:06:42.499 --> 00:06:47.659
 make a test of it so this is it personal 

00:06:45.289 --> 00:06:49.219
 I will end the test here hope 

00:06:47.659 --> 00:06:52.639
 You liked this video is a 

00:06:49.219 --> 00:06:54.349
 video contracted videos on scripts is me 

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:56.119
 I'll just make some cuts to that. 

00:06:54.349 --> 00:06:57.439
 video is too long because they are not 

00:06:56.119 --> 00:06:59.509
 monitoring how long I've been here 

00:06:57.439 --> 00:07:03.949
 playing then I do not want to criticize the video 

00:06:59.509 --> 00:07:05.419
 stay long so the staff is there 

00:07:03.949 --> 00:07:06.979
 I hope you have enjoyed a great 

00:07:05.419 --> 00:07:08.659
 embrace subscribe to the channel 

00:07:06.979 --> 00:07:10.669
 tell us in the comments if you want 

00:07:08.659 --> 00:07:12.889
 other games if you want another 

00:07:10.669 --> 00:07:14.869
 other settings 

00:07:12.889 --> 00:07:19.219
 many people asked for the project 

00:07:14.869 --> 00:07:21.469
 project cars also asked is this sound 

00:07:19.219 --> 00:07:22.489
 if man thinks this is the name of the 

00:07:21.469 --> 00:07:25.309
 game 

00:07:22.489 --> 00:07:27.289
 Finally there that if I have conditions 

00:07:25.309 --> 00:07:30.709
 run the game here I'll be running 

00:07:27.289 --> 00:07:32.659
 for you in various resolutions several 

00:07:30.709 --> 00:07:34.249
 different settings filled up 

00:07:32.659 --> 00:07:39.189
 beauty performance 

00:07:34.249 --> 00:07:39.189
 A big hug and see you later
