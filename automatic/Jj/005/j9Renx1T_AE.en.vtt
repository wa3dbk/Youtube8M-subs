00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.710
 all fishing lines have their 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.210
 advantages and disadvantages case 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.460
 she explains to us how to garnish her 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.410
 reel and which association of lanes 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.510
 realized to fish optimally 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.430
 it will also enlighten us on the 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.150
 big differences between 13 merge 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.150
 and braided wire 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.460
 for this episode we will see with what 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:57.239
 stuff a reel so nylon desk or 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.809
 So the question arises 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.170
 regularly 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:04.409
 on a reel gpus interest 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:09.840
 to put on nylon or so had to flee to 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:11.540
 carbon take into account the 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.369
 advantages and disadvantages of each 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.320
 the advantage of the nile we know that it is 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.720
 not very expensive to buy 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.910
 these discreet elastics that vibrate a lot 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.140
 less than the braid that allows everything from 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.420
 even to launch long distance 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.009
 afterwards at the resistance level 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.929
 will be stronger than a roatta flow 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.270
 equal but less resistant than a trace 

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:32.789
 equal diameter announced the elasticity of the 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.770
 nil have cumulated to the nerve of the can there who 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:36.210
 will bend during the fight 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.070
 it will allow both partners to 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.659
 pick up less fish once 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.240
 successful shoeing but the only 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.979
 particularity is that we will do a little 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.479
 wider a little more powerfully with 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.369
 nylon with just braid 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.319
 to compensate for this has elasticity 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.580
 afterwards you have to know that even for 

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:51.899
 sea â€‹â€‹trout that I fish a lot there 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.600
 I do all my balls cutei do not 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.369
 serves that I prefer to put nylon 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.790
 I like the end I fish fisheries 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:02.930
 general 16 hundredths there I prefer 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.930
 fish insistently
