00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:06.240
 Hello in this video is about 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.600
 yes toning or fat loss in conjunction with occasionally alcohol too 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.830
 drink as I was asked very often as it already because I can 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:14.809
 drink alcohol 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:16.120
 and for alcohol 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.800
 my results worsen 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.810
 I also want to talk about this topic in this video 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.159
 the very first points is very important to mention 

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:28.470
 Alcohol has goats calories per gram 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.050
 almost twice as much as proteins 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.360
 Carbohydrates in each case one sees already has more energy at the same 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.960
 amount 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.120
 not bad at the first volume 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.200
 but if you take more alcohol especially in the evening then still free 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.320
 on the weekend 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.660
 Japan can 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.900
 a few liters 4 or 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.090
 A high amount of alcohol will cause you too 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.520
 Fat is set 7 Halloween is already a lot 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.270
 and the second point is very important 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.230
 Alcohol it is like that but actually can not do anything with the alcohol 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.120
 he has yes for it 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.329
 that's why he does not burn alcohol for any real processes 

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:11.130
 immediately in energy 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.580
 That's good 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.490
 but it had a downside if you were 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.330
 yes, alcohol is still something 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.780
 or just hungry either sometime when eating out or going 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.230
 Peregrine falcon in front of it a bit 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:25.990
 only wants to crown tomorrow 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.720
 it is so that the very first alcohol is burned and then what they are 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.109
 So food should be full 

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:33.299
 and it should do that 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.680
 for example 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.850
 that's what food 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.210
 and because alcohol is too fatty to put on if you want to eat 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:41.500
 Apple if the body already 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.510
 because of the food Kiel Munich has taken calories if we because of the 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.030
 Rest years trying 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.350
 to burn 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.180
 but if it is not possible now everything or because of the old gold 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.810
 spring and then crumbled and he has compelled through the calculated 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.509
 Calories recorded then it happens too 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:02.009
 The watering down in fat is absorbed when salsa is narrowed 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:02.880
 disadvantage 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.030
 The paper quotes that it is very easy to add fat through alcohol 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.650
 That's why there is still a ticking in some people, even if they are regular 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.209
 drink a lot of beer 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.190
 second point is very interesting it was when you drink alcohol to yourself 

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:23.199
 Taking the closest to growth hormone levels plays our growth hormone 

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:26.259
 Yapi will be second to him once 

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:30.879
 Isa he improves l muscle building an increased growth mirror 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.359
 and percent the other time he also improves that 

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:39.109
 the fat burning when you have all the huts Merck has but through the alcohol 

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:43.749
 bitter growth hormone household reduces that means you gave 

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:46.329
 Hanisch build bad muscles 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:49.359
 and you burn worse 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:52.099
 Sbisa already pretty bad because there are three 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:53.349
 building up 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:58.720
 Hormones in the body and once it's the growth hormone it's it too 

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:01.469
 and once that insulin is in the 3 

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:03.629
 build up Cen 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:05.289
 without being in the body 

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:10.090
 and that's why it's important to know that a hormone boost is turned off 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.770
 or reduced if you have more alcohol or regular alcohol 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:16.449
 consumes 

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:20.049
 who growth hormone levels will reduce their own debt at low levels 

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:23.559
 Gives that far forward often 

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:24.659
 so it is 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:28.560
 Every weekend, two drinks three times, then one also happens 

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:30.320
 wider henniger depth effect 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.040
 and it will be a mockery mirror 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.489
 reduced 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:39.200
 Jesse Stone is yes the second anabolic every month says anabolic hormone 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:42.970
 and if it is reduced then the following happens as well 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.320
 Year due to a low testosterone value construction concept of bad muscles and 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.440
 Swimmers can also burn very badly very badly burned fat so 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.300
 you can already see that 2 important hormones are turned off 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:56.730
 for the simple reason 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.999
 Weinmann has taken alcohol 

00:03:59.999 --> 00:04:04.779
 and here he has kicked point which is not really great either 

00:04:04.779 --> 00:04:07.899
 Although magnesium is released by alcohol 

00:04:07.899 --> 00:04:10.579
 and magnesium is actually important 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:12.039
 on the one hand 

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:16.249
 The bones strengthen the bones nicely from botnets and partially 

00:04:16.249 --> 00:04:17.979
 and on the other hand 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:19.259
 that he 

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:20.299
 Yes 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:25.260
 Powerfully increasing our power after regular magnesium increases a name 

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:25.640
 Has 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.410
 I have already noticed that I have slightly increased my strength 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:28.860
 by 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:29.979
 magnesium 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:33.370
 and that applies if you have a magnesium deficiency or you 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:38.080
 Drunk much alcohol because it is still unoccupied in the mirror 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.870
 also for the journey 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.979
 few and mesum also increases the stress factor 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:47.919
 So that's not the alcohol has benefits I have it too 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:49.490
 found a real advantage 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.510
 Also, before that, Moss will naturally feel a bit more relaxed 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.400
 a little bit 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.450
 having a bit more fun maybe than getting degenerated out of it 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:02.080
 but from the fitness area and alcohol no benefits 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.360
 and has another disadvantage 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.360
 For example, I can always go away on the weekend, for example, and it's two of them 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.360
 or three o'clock at night way there you usually stick to 11 or 12 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:16.650
 and during this time you have usually missed two to three meals and if 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.710
 you missed the capek so where does it take a calorie and it can too 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:20.960
 again 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.020
 to take the muscles 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.930
 and 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.180
 yes so you see, for example, disadvantages he will from different sources wants me 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.889
 easy 

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:33.509
 the Muslim will either use the growth hormone to reduce third-ass 

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:34.599
 so reduce scorn 

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:37.830
 or if you just do not feel like that for many hours 

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:39.719
 had to die 

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:41.229
 the calories too 

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:42.830
 about Dr 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:45.870
 get over the body and there is some agree his most important 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:48.300
 he is good at this 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.439
 These calories are actually more 

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:53.440
 it had to catch up with him 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.050
 if you sleep too long, such as weekend when you are 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.029
 yes very late to bed we sleep very long 

00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:02.779
 That's why I actually find here 

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:07.319
 no alcohol at the moment we drink alcohol we all emerge as little as 

00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:08.340
 possible to drink 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:12.990
 because by an increased or a regular one for alcohol pity 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:15.270
 also send some sports themselves 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:18.700
 the whole week probably costs a lot of discipline 

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:20.900
 with probably a good diet 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:22.210
 this time fails 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:25.990
 with hard training that shoots us back in the born end 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:29.849
 whoever drinks alcohol can then drive down hormone levels and 

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:31.259
 as a result less is 

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:34.339
 and that's why I can not recommend her, but I still hoped 

00:06:34.339 --> 00:06:36.249
 to have helped this video 

00:06:36.249 --> 00:06:37.759
 if you have more questions 

00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:40.180
 Put Kazimierz below this canal 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:41.389
 if Lohan 

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:45.210
 we have more of the SC Melzer you can know here on and off the kick 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:46.189
 apply wait 

00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:50.589
 or you go to Natural - bodybuilder points there I have a free one 

00:06:50.589 --> 00:06:51.949
 expensive Mio 

00:06:51.949 --> 00:06:54.860
 Build muscle can look out for South of Pop 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.820
 and yes there you get everything because this is praise too 

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:00.860
 I wish it all too much fun to Flavio Cotti monetarily
