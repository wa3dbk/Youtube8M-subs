00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
apartment is better than my old one

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.869 
apartment is better than my old one
because<00:00:54.930> it<00:00:55.350> has<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.500> better<00:00:55.710> view<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.730> know

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.400 
because it has a better view you know
for<00:00:57.270> those<00:00:57.360> long<00:00:57.660> nights<00:00:57.690> where<00:00:58.260> I'm<00:00:58.379> just

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
for those long nights where I'm just

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.349 
for those long nights where I'm just
sitting<00:00:58.859> inside<00:00:59.010> my<00:00:59.370> apartment<00:00:59.520> on<00:00:59.940> GTA

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
sitting inside my apartment on GTA

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
as far as the other cars like the

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:04.729 
as far as the other cars like the
motorcycle<00:04:03.870> I<00:04:03.959> have<00:04:04.230> a<00:04:04.260> really<00:04:04.470> cool

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
motorcycle I have a really cool

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.080 
motorcycle I have a really cool
motorcycle<00:04:05.220> but<00:04:05.280> i'll<00:04:05.400> probably<00:04:05.580> still<00:04:05.880> buy

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
motorcycle but i'll probably still buy

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.810 
motorcycle but i'll probably still buy
the<00:04:06.150> motorcycle<00:04:06.390> and<00:04:06.959> test<00:04:07.290> it<00:04:07.470> out<00:04:07.640> which<00:04:08.640> i

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
the motorcycle and test it out which i

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.130 
the motorcycle and test it out which i
think<00:04:08.880> will<00:04:09.120> be<00:04:09.209> really<00:04:09.239> cool<00:04:09.660> and<00:04:09.959> then<00:04:10.049> the
