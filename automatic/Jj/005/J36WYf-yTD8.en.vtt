would<00:03:09.030> be<00:03:09.060> cloud<00:03:09.420> storage<00:03:09.780> for<00:03:10.049> all<00:03:10.079> game

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
would be cloud storage for all game

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.740 
would be cloud storage for all game
states<00:03:10.680> and<00:03:10.920> profiles<00:03:11.370> that's<00:03:12.120> pretty<00:03:12.420> neat

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
states and profiles that's pretty neat

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.680 
states and profiles that's pretty neat
if<00:03:13.049> you<00:03:13.470> play<00:03:13.769> a<00:03:13.799> lot<00:03:14.100> of<00:03:14.310> canes<00:03:14.609> and<00:03:14.970> you<00:03:15.450> kind

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
if you play a lot of canes and you kind

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.710 
if you play a lot of canes and you kind
of<00:03:15.720> need<00:03:15.900> the<00:03:16.079> extra<00:03:16.350> space<00:03:16.680> here<00:03:16.980> and<00:03:17.130> there

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
of need the extra space here and there

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.840 
of need the extra space here and there
you<00:03:17.780> actually<00:03:18.530> put<00:03:18.860> your<00:03:19.010> games<00:03:19.190> onto<00:03:19.400> the<00:03:19.640> box

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
you actually put your games onto the box

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.150 
you actually put your games onto the box
so<00:03:20.270> it's<00:03:20.600> not<00:03:20.810> sitting<00:03:21.110> there<00:03:21.470> sounding<00:03:22.040> like

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
so it's not sitting there sounding like

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.950 
so it's not sitting there sounding like
a<00:03:22.220> jet<00:03:22.490> engine<00:03:22.520> taking<00:03:23.270> all<00:03:23.450> but<00:03:23.660> that<00:03:23.750> is

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:23.960 
a jet engine taking all but that is

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.080 
a jet engine taking all but that is
pretty<00:03:24.380> neat<00:03:24.950> that<00:03:25.250> you<00:03:25.280> can<00:03:25.580> have<00:03:25.760> it<00:03:25.880> on<00:03:25.970> the

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
pretty neat that you can have it on the

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:27.700 
pretty neat that you can have it on the
cloud<00:03:26.300> so<00:03:26.600> I'm<00:03:26.780> wondering<00:03:26.900> if<00:03:27.260> it's<00:03:27.380> something

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:27.710 
cloud so I'm wondering if it's something

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:30.040 
cloud so I'm wondering if it's something
where<00:03:28.280> you<00:03:28.550> take<00:03:28.760> your<00:03:28.790> gamertag<00:03:29.450> on<00:03:29.870> your

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
where you take your gamertag on your

thumb drive to a friend's house and

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.040 
thumb drive to a friend's house and
you're<00:03:31.610> able<00:03:31.730> to<00:03:31.880> pull<00:03:32.120> up<00:03:32.300> the<00:03:32.450> save<00:03:32.720> through

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.050 
you're able to pull up the save through

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:34.900 
you're able to pull up the save through
the<00:03:33.140> cloud<00:03:33.350> I'm<00:03:33.620> wondering<00:03:33.950> it<00:03:34.070> that's<00:03:34.340> how<00:03:34.610> it

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
the cloud I'm wondering it that's how it

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.060 
the cloud I'm wondering it that's how it
will<00:03:35.090> work<00:03:35.150> hopefully<00:03:35.990> we'll<00:03:36.170> anywho<00:03:36.740> what

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
will work hopefully we'll anywho what

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.060 
will work hopefully we'll anywho what

private server and mess around and build
stuff<00:04:08.750> so<00:04:09.050> that's<00:04:09.440> been<00:04:09.860> a<00:04:09.920> lot<00:04:10.130> of<00:04:10.160> fun

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
stuff so that's been a lot of fun

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.940 
stuff so that's been a lot of fun
because<00:04:10.670> I<00:04:11.300> was<00:04:11.660> just<00:04:11.930> on<00:04:12.140> this<00:04:12.320> huge<00:04:12.620> omission

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
because I was just on this huge omission

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.130 
because I was just on this huge omission
where<00:04:13.370> i<00:04:13.400> was<00:04:13.820> going<00:04:13.850> to<00:04:14.030> build<00:04:14.240> like<00:04:14.510> a<00:04:14.720> small

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
where i was going to build like a small

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:16.840 
where i was going to build like a small
replica<00:04:15.740> of<00:04:15.920> the<00:04:16.010> freeport<00:04:16.459> gates<00:04:16.669> from

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:18.550 
replica of the freeport gates from
EverQuest<00:04:17.450> because<00:04:17.840> I'm<00:04:18.019> just<00:04:18.230> such<00:04:18.380> an

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
EverQuest because I'm just such an

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.710 
EverQuest because I'm just such an
EverQuest<00:04:19.100> attic<00:04:19.430> still<00:04:19.760> years<00:04:20.180> later<00:04:20.299> and

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
EverQuest attic still years later and

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.750 
EverQuest attic still years later and
quite<00:04:21.590> proud<00:04:21.799> of<00:04:21.830> myself<00:04:21.950> it<00:04:22.340> looks<00:04:22.490> pretty

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
quite proud of myself it looks pretty

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.970 
quite proud of myself it looks pretty
decent<00:04:22.970> of<00:04:23.300> course<00:04:23.570> it's<00:04:23.870> not<00:04:23.990> like<00:04:24.530> a<00:04:24.710> full

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:24.980 
decent of course it's not like a full

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.100 
decent of course it's not like a full
replica<00:04:25.550> because<00:04:25.730> I<00:04:26.210> probably<00:04:26.600> should<00:04:26.930> put

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
replica because I probably should put

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.350 
replica because I probably should put
sand<00:04:27.410> down<00:04:27.620> but<00:04:28.070> it's<00:04:28.190> all<00:04:28.340> grass<00:04:28.610> and<00:04:29.120> I<00:04:29.180> got<00:04:29.330> a

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
sand down but it's all grass and I got a

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.640 
sand down but it's all grass and I got a
little<00:04:29.570> fountain<00:04:29.900> in<00:04:30.140> there<00:04:30.320> and<00:04:30.470> some

little fountain in there and some
benches<00:04:31.130> and<00:04:31.610> flowers<00:04:32.570> everywhere<00:04:32.840> because<00:04:33.140> I

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:33.229 
benches and flowers everywhere because I

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:35.380 
benches and flowers everywhere because I
had<00:04:33.440> to<00:04:33.530> grow<00:04:33.770> lit<00:04:33.950> up<00:04:34.100> I<00:04:34.370> mean<00:04:34.729> I'm<00:04:35.060> a<00:04:35.150> girl<00:04:35.330> I'm

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:35.390 
had to grow lit up I mean I'm a girl I'm

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:37.900 
had to grow lit up I mean I'm a girl I'm
supposed<00:04:35.810> to<00:04:35.930> do<00:04:36.140> that<00:04:36.290> and<00:04:36.560> I<00:04:36.680> also<00:04:36.710> um<00:04:37.430> turned

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 
supposed to do that and I also um turned

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:39.159 
supposed to do that and I also um turned
one<00:04:38.150> of<00:04:38.180> the<00:04:38.270> towers<00:04:38.780> into<00:04:39.020> like<00:04:39.140> a

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:39.169 
one of the towers into like a

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:41.350 
one of the towers into like a
three-story<00:04:39.830> home<00:04:40.100> for<00:04:40.400> myself<00:04:40.790> it<00:04:41.180> was

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
three-story home for myself it was

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.000 
three-story home for myself it was
really<00:04:41.600> funny<00:04:41.840> because<00:04:41.990> I<00:04:42.169> was<00:04:42.380> streaming<00:04:42.830> it

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010 
really funny because I was streaming it
