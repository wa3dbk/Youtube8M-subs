00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:07.550 
hello everybody this is Mike Poong from

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.600 
hello everybody this is Mike Poong from
Gold<00:00:07.790> Cube<00:00:08.500> one<00:00:09.500> of<00:00:09.620> the<00:00:09.680> biggest<00:00:10.130> problems

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:10.610 
Gold Cube one of the biggest problems

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.560 
Gold Cube one of the biggest problems
with<00:00:11.230> recirculating<00:00:12.230> on<00:00:13.040> any<00:00:13.400> device<00:00:13.790> is<00:00:14.120> the

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:14.570 
with recirculating on any device is the

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.740 
with recirculating on any device is the
fact<00:00:14.840> that<00:00:14.990> vegetation<00:00:15.800> gets<00:00:16.550> in<00:00:16.730> the<00:00:16.820> way<00:00:16.970> the

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:17.750 
fact that vegetation gets in the way the

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.410 
fact that vegetation gets in the way the
silt<00:00:18.080> thickens<00:00:18.980> up<00:00:19.130> the<00:00:19.310> water<00:00:19.520> and<00:00:19.849> it<00:00:20.390> makes

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:20.420 
silt thickens up the water and it makes

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.330 
silt thickens up the water and it makes
it<00:00:20.779> to<00:00:20.930> where<00:00:20.960> the<00:00:21.320> water<00:00:21.529> can<00:00:21.860> no<00:00:22.070> longer

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:22.340 
it to where the water can no longer

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.210 
it to where the water can no longer
allow<00:00:22.730> the<00:00:23.000> goal<00:00:23.360> to<00:00:23.599> drop<00:00:23.869> out<00:00:24.110> and<00:00:24.590> be

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
allow the goal to drop out and be

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.909 
allow the goal to drop out and be
captured<00:00:25.730> so<00:00:26.390> the<00:00:26.509> goal<00:00:26.689> just<00:00:26.960> kind<00:00:27.230> of<00:00:27.380> floats

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:27.919 
captured so the goal just kind of floats

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:30.370 
captured so the goal just kind of floats
along<00:00:28.130> with<00:00:28.550> the<00:00:28.759> sludge<00:00:29.180> now<00:00:29.989> what<00:00:30.200> we're

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
along with the sludge now what we're

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.409 
along with the sludge now what we're
going<00:00:30.529> to<00:00:30.559> do<00:00:30.770> is<00:00:31.399> we've<00:00:31.610> come<00:00:31.849> up<00:00:31.880> with<00:00:32.029> a<00:00:32.210> new

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:32.419 
going to do is we've come up with a new

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:34.569 
going to do is we've come up with a new
flange<00:00:32.930> assembly<00:00:33.710> called<00:00:33.920> the<00:00:34.040> tub<00:00:34.250> flange

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:34.579 
flange assembly called the tub flange

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:36.330 
flange assembly called the tub flange
that<00:00:35.000> we're<00:00:35.149> going<00:00:35.270> to<00:00:35.329> be<00:00:35.420> able<00:00:35.540> to<00:00:35.720> connect

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.340 
that we're going to be able to connect

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.119 
that we're going to be able to connect
multiple<00:00:37.340> tubs<00:00:38.030> together<00:00:38.600> so<00:00:39.440> we<00:00:39.620> can<00:00:39.829> create

00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:40.129 
multiple tubs together so we can create

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:43.119 
multiple tubs together so we can create
settling<00:00:40.850> ponds<00:00:41.329> now<00:00:42.140> the<00:00:42.500> tubs<00:00:42.739> that<00:00:42.859> we're

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
settling ponds now the tubs that we're

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:45.579 
settling ponds now the tubs that we're
talking<00:00:43.309> about<00:00:43.579> is<00:00:44.149> these<00:00:44.390> mixing<00:00:44.899> tubs<00:00:45.170> we've

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:45.589 
talking about is these mixing tubs we've

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:47.500 
talking about is these mixing tubs we've
got<00:00:45.800> these<00:00:45.949> mixing<00:00:46.399> tubs<00:00:46.699> and<00:00:46.910> what<00:00:47.359> we're

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
got these mixing tubs and what we're

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:48.880 
got these mixing tubs and what we're
going<00:00:47.629> to<00:00:47.690> do<00:00:47.899> is<00:00:48.050> we're<00:00:48.199> going<00:00:48.230> to<00:00:48.350> take<00:00:48.589> and

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
going to do is we're going to take and

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.099 
going to do is we're going to take and
we're<00:00:49.219> going<00:00:49.249> to<00:00:49.429> add<00:00:49.550> a<00:00:49.879> tee<00:00:49.940> which<00:00:50.809> is<00:00:50.989> going

00:00:51.099 --> 00:00:51.109 
we're going to add a tee which is going

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:54.009 
we're going to add a tee which is going
to<00:00:51.170> be<00:00:51.350> a<00:00:51.379> vegetation<00:00:51.949> blocker<00:00:52.429> and<00:00:52.879> then<00:00:53.719> in

00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:54.019 
to be a vegetation blocker and then in

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:56.979 
to be a vegetation blocker and then in
the<00:00:54.320> vegetation<00:00:54.890> blocker<00:00:55.370> it's<00:00:56.239> going<00:00:56.480> to<00:00:56.539> get

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
the vegetation blocker it's going to get

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:59.610 
the vegetation blocker it's going to get
its<00:00:57.289> way<00:00:57.530> through<00:00:57.980> the<00:00:58.280> tub<00:00:58.579> using<00:00:59.149> a<00:00:59.269> flange

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
its way through the tub using a flange

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.380 
its way through the tub using a flange
now<00:01:00.620> this<00:01:00.890> flange<00:01:01.249> is<00:01:01.550> made<00:01:01.789> out<00:01:01.969> of<00:01:02.120> stainless

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
now this flange is made out of stainless

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.350 
now this flange is made out of stainless
steel<00:01:02.980> it<00:01:03.980> will<00:01:04.010> create<00:01:04.400> a<00:01:04.519> seal<00:01:04.909> with<00:01:05.210> this

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
steel it will create a seal with this

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.710 
steel it will create a seal with this
rubber<00:01:05.630> gasket<00:01:06.310> so<00:01:07.310> we've<00:01:07.430> got<00:01:07.720> stainless

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
rubber gasket so we've got stainless

00:01:11.889 --> 00:01:11.899 
steel on the outside the inside and then

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:14.230 
steel on the outside the inside and then
we<00:01:11.990> have<00:01:12.170> this<00:01:12.320> rubber<00:01:12.619> gasket<00:01:12.890> so<00:01:13.790> all<00:01:13.970> this

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
we have this rubber gasket so all this

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.620 
we have this rubber gasket so all this
is<00:01:14.450> going<00:01:14.600> to<00:01:14.689> be<00:01:14.810> helping<00:01:15.170> another<00:01:16.630> by

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
is going to be helping another by

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.870 
is going to be helping another by
stainless<00:01:18.049> steel<00:01:18.409> screws<00:01:18.829> that's<00:01:19.520> so<00:01:19.700> we

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
stainless steel screws that's so we

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.749

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:45.740 
inside that screw hole there and that's

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.040 
inside that screw hole there and that's
going<00:02:46.010> to<00:02:46.100> keep<00:02:46.280> us<00:02:46.460> lined<00:02:46.820> up<00:02:47.090> and<00:02:47.390> then<00:02:47.930> I'm

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
other half of the flange assembly that

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.960 
other half of the flange assembly that
is<00:03:14.690> threaded<00:03:15.470> and<00:03:16.070> I'm<00:03:16.280> actually<00:03:16.520> going<00:03:16.880> to

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
is threaded and I'm actually going to

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.090 
is threaded and I'm actually going to
take<00:03:17.300> it<00:03:17.450> on<00:03:17.570> the<00:03:17.690> back<00:03:17.900> side<00:03:18.170> and<00:03:18.440> screw<00:03:18.770> it<00:03:18.920> in

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.660 

okay<00:03:42.050> you<00:03:42.110> notice<00:03:42.530> that<00:03:42.680> I'm<00:03:42.830> not<00:03:42.860> using<00:03:43.069> a

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
okay you notice that I'm not using a

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:49.240 
okay you notice that I'm not using a
gasket<00:03:47.200> because<00:03:48.200> we're<00:03:48.470> actually<00:03:48.770> going<00:03:49.160> to

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
gasket because we're actually going to

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.640 
gasket because we're actually going to
be<00:03:49.400> using<00:03:49.670> the<00:03:50.030> quarter<00:03:50.420> inch<00:03:50.660> drill<00:03:51.080> bit<00:03:51.380> to

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
be using the quarter inch drill bit to

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:59.620 
be using the quarter inch drill bit to
cut<00:03:52.610> the<00:03:53.540> big<00:03:53.900> middle<00:03:54.290> hole<00:03:58.209> the<00:03:59.209> flange

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
cut the big middle hole the flange

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.979 
cut the big middle hole the flange
itself<00:04:00.260> is<00:04:00.530> actually<00:04:00.950> going<00:04:01.130> to<00:04:01.250> be<00:04:01.400> the<00:04:01.580> guide

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
itself is actually going to be the guide

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:07.390 
itself is actually going to be the guide
for<00:04:02.989> the<00:04:03.110> quarter<00:04:03.530> inch<00:04:03.770> drill<00:04:04.220> bit<00:04:04.520> to<00:04:06.400> cut

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
for the quarter inch drill bit to cut

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.090 
for the quarter inch drill bit to cut
that<00:04:07.580> out<00:04:07.880> it's<00:04:08.600> going<00:04:08.780> to<00:04:08.840> be<00:04:08.900> pretty<00:04:09.200> cool

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.100 

now<00:04:13.100> you<00:04:13.130> notice<00:04:13.700> that<00:04:13.730> I've<00:04:14.360> got<00:04:14.660> this<00:04:14.870> up

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.110 
now you notice that I've got this up

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:16.180 
now you notice that I've got this up
against<00:04:15.560> the<00:04:15.680> wall

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
against the wall

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.340 
against the wall
the<00:04:16.880> reason<00:04:17.239> I've<00:04:17.390> got<00:04:17.570> it<00:04:17.690> against<00:04:18.049> the<00:04:18.140> walls

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
the reason I've got it against the walls

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.409 
the reason I've got it against the walls
because<00:04:18.769> I'm<00:04:18.950> going<00:04:19.220> to<00:04:19.340> lean<00:04:19.579> against<00:04:20.150> it<00:04:20.239> and

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
because I'm going to lean against it and

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:23.380 
because I'm going to lean against it and
that's<00:04:20.660> going<00:04:20.989> to<00:04:21.109> secure<00:04:21.640> the<00:04:22.640> cut<00:04:22.940> because

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:23.390 
that's going to secure the cut because

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:24.580 
that's going to secure the cut because
what<00:04:23.690> we're<00:04:23.840> gonna<00:04:23.930> do<00:04:24.169> is<00:04:24.320> we're<00:04:24.440> going<00:04:24.530> to

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
what we're gonna do is we're going to

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.800 
what we're gonna do is we're going to
drill<00:04:24.860> down<00:04:25.070> and<00:04:25.400> leaving<00:04:26.120> the<00:04:26.360> drill<00:04:26.630> bit

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
drill down and leaving the drill bit

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.900 
drill down and leaving the drill bit
running<00:04:27.229> we're<00:04:27.350> gonna<00:04:27.440> go<00:04:27.680> clockwise<00:04:28.220> and

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
running we're gonna go clockwise and

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.270 
running we're gonna go clockwise and
allow<00:04:29.690> the<00:04:29.750> drill<00:04:30.290> bit<00:04:30.530> cutting<00:04:31.130> all<00:04:31.250> right

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
allow the drill bit cutting all right

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.860 
allow the drill bit cutting all right
about<00:04:31.520> in<00:04:31.610> the<00:04:31.700> middle<00:04:31.880> of<00:04:32.060> it<00:04:32.210> we're<00:04:32.810> gonna

installed in the tub now it's going to

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:43.160 
installed in the tub now it's going to
be<00:06:40.260> a<00:06:40.290> very<00:06:40.680> tight<00:06:41.220> fit<00:06:41.850> it's<00:06:42.780> going<00:06:42.990> to<00:06:43.050> be

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:43.170 
be a very tight fit it's going to be

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:45.110 
be a very tight fit it's going to be
very<00:06:43.440> tight<00:06:43.740> because<00:06:44.130> we<00:06:44.340> want<00:06:44.610> a<00:06:44.730> good

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:45.120 
very tight because we want a good

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.470 
very tight because we want a good
friction<00:06:45.840> fit<00:06:46.380> in<00:06:46.620> there<00:06:46.800> so<00:06:47.490> it's<00:06:47.880> gonna<00:06:48.090> just

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:48.480 
friction fit in there so it's gonna just

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:49.930 
friction fit in there so it's gonna just
take<00:06:48.630> them<00:06:48.780> pushing<00:06:49.020> on<00:06:49.200> a<00:06:49.230> little<00:06:49.410> bit<00:06:49.560> angle

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:49.940 
take them pushing on a little bit angle

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:55.730 
take them pushing on a little bit angle
twist<00:06:50.940> and<00:06:51.240> push<00:06:53.240> just<00:06:54.240> like<00:06:54.360> that<00:06:54.750> all<00:06:55.680> right

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:55.740 
twist and push just like that all right

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:58.610 
twist and push just like that all right
now<00:06:55.920> our<00:06:56.850> vegetation<00:06:57.480> our<00:06:57.900> water<00:06:58.140> level<00:06:58.410> is

00:06:58.610 --> 00:06:58.620 
now our vegetation our water level is

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:00.080 
now our vegetation our water level is
going<00:06:58.740> to<00:06:58.800> be<00:06:58.890> about<00:06:59.220> that<00:06:59.520> high

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:00.090 
going to be about that high

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:02.450 
going to be about that high
the<00:07:00.720> vegetation<00:07:01.320> floating<00:07:01.980> around<00:07:02.070> in<00:07:02.430> here

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:02.460 
the vegetation floating around in here

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.370 
the vegetation floating around in here
is<00:07:02.730> not<00:07:03.000> going<00:07:03.240> to<00:07:03.300> be<00:07:03.390> able<00:07:03.450> to<00:07:03.630> drop<00:07:03.840> in<00:07:04.140> so

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:04.380 
is not going to be able to drop in so

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:06.320 
is not going to be able to drop in so
the<00:07:04.500> only<00:07:04.710> thing<00:07:05.070> that's<00:07:05.250> coming<00:07:05.640> in<00:07:05.820> is<00:07:05.850> water

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:06.330 
the only thing that's coming in is water

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.990 
the only thing that's coming in is water
from<00:07:06.720> below<00:07:07.220> all<00:07:08.220> right<00:07:08.430> that's<00:07:08.670> going<00:07:08.910> to

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:09.000 
from below all right that's going to

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.840 
from below all right that's going to
pass<00:07:09.180> better<00:07:09.810> water<00:07:10.230> into<00:07:10.950> the<00:07:11.070> next<00:07:11.340> tub<00:07:11.580> and

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:11.850 
pass better water into the next tub and

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:13.910 
pass better water into the next tub and
that's<00:07:12.390> going<00:07:12.540> to<00:07:12.630> act<00:07:12.810> like<00:07:13.020> a<00:07:13.050> settling<00:07:13.590> pond

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:13.920 
that's going to act like a settling pond

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:17.210 
that's going to act like a settling pond
and<00:07:14.400> then<00:07:15.030> that<00:07:15.210> settling<00:07:15.690> of<00:07:15.900> the<00:07:16.220> the

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:17.220 
and then that settling of the the

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:19.340 
and then that settling of the the
particulates<00:07:17.940> trapped<00:07:18.330> in<00:07:18.540> the<00:07:18.630> in<00:07:19.050> the<00:07:19.170> water

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:19.350 
particulates trapped in the in the water

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:21.320 
particulates trapped in the in the water
are<00:07:19.770> going<00:07:20.310> to<00:07:20.400> make<00:07:20.550> your<00:07:20.730> water<00:07:20.910> cleaner

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:21.330 
are going to make your water cleaner

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:23.630 
are going to make your water cleaner
when<00:07:21.900> you<00:07:21.990> pick<00:07:22.200> up<00:07:22.230> the<00:07:22.860> water<00:07:23.100> at<00:07:23.310> the<00:07:23.400> pump

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:23.640 
when you pick up the water at the pump

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.880 
when you pick up the water at the pump
at<00:07:23.790> the<00:07:23.910> end<00:07:24.120> of<00:07:24.450> the<00:07:24.600> recirculating<00:07:25.440> system

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:25.890 
at the end of the recirculating system

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:29.270 
at the end of the recirculating system
so<00:07:26.700> very<00:07:27.330> important<00:07:27.840> device<00:07:28.080> an<00:07:28.350> easy<00:07:29.010> way<00:07:29.250> to

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:29.280 
so very important device an easy way to

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:31.310 
so very important device an easy way to
get<00:07:29.550> these<00:07:29.790> together<00:07:30.000> and<00:07:30.750> when<00:07:31.080> it<00:07:31.170> comes

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:31.320 
get these together and when it comes

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:33.980 
get these together and when it comes
time<00:07:31.620> to<00:07:31.680> go<00:07:31.920> home<00:07:32.100> it's<00:07:32.480> just<00:07:33.480> as<00:07:33.660> easy<00:07:33.780> to

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:33.990 
time to go home it's just as easy to

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:37.790 
time to go home it's just as easy to
take<00:07:34.620> and<00:07:34.830> pull<00:07:35.400> these<00:07:35.550> things<00:07:35.760> out<00:07:36.290> now<00:07:37.290> these

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:37.800 
take and pull these things out now these

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:40.340 
take and pull these things out now these
being<00:07:38.250> low-profile<00:07:39.120> it's<00:07:39.750> going<00:07:39.960> to<00:07:40.020> make<00:07:40.170> it

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:40.350 
being low-profile it's going to make it

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:42.290 
being low-profile it's going to make it
so<00:07:40.500> you<00:07:40.530> can<00:07:40.770> actually<00:07:40.950> stack<00:07:41.490> your<00:07:41.730> tubs<00:07:42.000> back

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:44.550 
on top of each other and it's gonna be a

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:47.210 
on top of each other and it's gonna be a
very<00:07:44.790> easy<00:07:44.850> transport<00:07:45.600> I<00:07:45.960> hope<00:07:46.770> you<00:07:46.920> like<00:07:47.100> the
