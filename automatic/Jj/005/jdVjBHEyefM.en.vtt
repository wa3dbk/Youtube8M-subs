00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.700 
basically you're going to look at this
blue<00:00:41.030> tile<00:00:41.390> here<00:00:41.720> and<00:00:41.930> this<00:00:42.020> blue<00:00:42.230> tile<00:00:42.470> will

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
blue tile here and this blue tile will

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.410 
blue tile here and this blue tile will
have<00:00:42.860> a<00:00:42.890> symbol<00:00:43.400> you<00:00:43.580> have<00:00:43.760> to<00:00:43.940> match<00:00:44.150> it<00:00:44.390> with

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
have a symbol you have to match it with

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.170 
have a symbol you have to match it with
these<00:00:44.750> the<00:00:45.710> symbols<00:00:46.190> or<00:00:46.430> the<00:00:46.460> tiles<00:00:47.000> on<00:00:47.120> the

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
these the symbols or the tiles on the

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.660 
these the symbols or the tiles on the
ceiling<00:00:47.690> of<00:00:48.050> the<00:00:48.260> sort<00:00:48.530> of<00:00:48.590> ice<00:00:48.800> chamber<00:00:49.250> and

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
ceiling of the sort of ice chamber and

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.300 
ceiling of the sort of ice chamber and
basically<00:00:50.420> I<00:00:50.540> have<00:00:50.780> a<00:00:50.900> code<00:00:51.140> here<00:00:51.590> so<00:00:51.980> on<00:00:52.160> the

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:52.310 
basically I have a code here so on the

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.370 
basically I have a code here so on the
left<00:00:52.610> side<00:00:52.730> of<00:00:53.090> the<00:00:53.180> equal<00:00:53.510> sign<00:00:53.540> is<00:00:53.960> as<00:00:54.140> you

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:54.380 
left side of the equal sign is as you

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.979 
left side of the equal sign is as you
see<00:00:54.590> there<00:00:54.860> and<00:00:55.070> you<00:00:55.640> can<00:00:55.820> see<00:00:56.060> a<00:00:56.329> filled

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
see there and you can see a filled

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:59.290 
see there and you can see a filled
circles<00:00:57.530> and<00:00:57.770> hollow<00:00:58.160> circles<00:00:58.700> and<00:00:58.910> those

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
circles and hollow circles and those

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.510 
circles and hollow circles and those
symbols<00:00:59.989> will<00:01:00.140> always<00:01:00.530> be<00:01:00.680> on<00:01:00.860> the<00:01:00.890> blue<00:01:01.190> tiles

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520 
symbols will always be on the blue tiles

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.130 
symbols will always be on the blue tiles
not<00:01:01.820> on<00:01:01.970> the<00:01:02.090> right<00:01:02.300> side<00:01:02.570> where<00:01:02.810> you<00:01:02.870> can<00:01:02.989> see

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
not on the right side where you can see

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.079 
not on the right side where you can see
the<00:01:03.260> triangles<00:01:03.829> and<00:01:04.009> the<00:01:04.129> lines<00:01:04.399> you<00:01:05.000> will

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
the triangles and the lines you will

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:07.300 
the triangles and the lines you will
actually<00:01:05.299> be<00:01:05.540> able<00:01:05.659> to<00:01:05.960> see<00:01:06.530> those<00:01:06.770> on<00:01:07.070> the

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
actually be able to see those on the

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.580 
actually be able to see those on the
ceiling<00:01:07.729> so<00:01:07.970> whatever<00:01:08.330> shows<00:01:08.900> up<00:01:09.110> on<00:01:09.260> the<00:01:09.380> blue

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
ceiling so whatever shows up on the blue

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.530 
ceiling so whatever shows up on the blue
tile<00:01:09.830> just<00:01:10.130> shoot<00:01:10.430> it<00:01:10.550> with<00:01:10.700> the<00:01:10.729> frost<00:01:11.240> stuff

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
tile just shoot it with the frost stuff

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:12.790 
tile just shoot it with the frost stuff
you<00:01:11.690> have<00:01:11.900> to<00:01:12.020> make<00:01:12.170> sure<00:01:12.200> it's<00:01:12.470> the<00:01:12.530> frost

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:12.800 
you have to make sure it's the frost

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.710 
you have to make sure it's the frost
staff<00:01:13.040> or<00:01:13.250> else<00:01:13.400> it<00:01:13.520> won't<00:01:13.640> work<00:01:13.760> so<00:01:14.120> whatever

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
staff or else it won't work so whatever

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.570 
staff or else it won't work so whatever
shows<00:01:14.960> up<00:01:15.110> on<00:01:15.229> the<00:01:15.320> blue<00:01:15.500> tiles<00:01:15.800> you<00:01:16.070> shoot<00:01:16.430> it

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
shows up on the blue tiles you shoot it

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.280 
shows up on the blue tiles you shoot it
on<00:01:16.729> the<00:01:16.909> ceiling<00:01:17.330> and<00:01:17.450> once<00:01:17.810> you<00:01:17.930> have<00:01:18.080> done

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
on the ceiling and once you have done

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.410 
on the ceiling and once you have done
that<00:01:18.320> you<00:01:18.680> will<00:01:18.799> actually<00:01:19.040> be<00:01:19.549> able<00:01:19.790> to<00:01:20.299> move

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
that you will actually be able to move

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.350 
that you will actually be able to move
on<00:01:20.630> to<00:01:20.810> the<00:01:20.900> next<00:01:21.080> step<00:01:21.440> now<00:01:21.890> do<00:01:22.790> keep<00:01:23.030> this<00:01:23.180> in

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
on to the next step now do keep this in

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.149 
on to the next step now do keep this in
mind<00:01:23.540> guys<00:01:23.780> if<00:01:24.020> you<00:01:24.110> do<00:01:24.350> screw<00:01:24.680> up<00:01:24.799> you<00:01:24.979> will

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
mind guys if you do screw up you will

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:27.730 
mind guys if you do screw up you will
have<00:01:25.190> to<00:01:25.610> restart<00:01:25.850> this<00:01:26.390> step<00:01:26.780> it<00:01:26.990> may<00:01:27.440> take<00:01:27.710> a

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
have to restart this step it may take a

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.280 
have to restart this step it may take a
while<00:01:28.040> but<00:01:28.400> eventually<00:01:28.430> you<00:01:29.360> will<00:01:29.600> get<00:01:29.840> it<00:01:30.049> and

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
while but eventually you will get it and

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.469 
while but eventually you will get it and
it<00:01:30.560> will<00:01:30.680> be<00:01:30.860> quite<00:01:31.159> easy<00:01:31.460> now<00:01:31.820> I'm<00:01:31.940> sure<00:01:32.180> I<00:01:32.210> got

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
it will be quite easy now I'm sure I got

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:34.750 
it will be quite easy now I'm sure I got
all<00:01:32.540> of<00:01:32.869> them<00:01:33.020> up<00:01:33.200> there<00:01:33.229> now<00:01:34.010> on<00:01:34.220> to<00:01:34.400> the<00:01:34.520> next

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:34.760 
all of them up there now on to the next

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.100 
all of them up there now on to the next
step<00:01:35.030> basically<00:01:35.450> you're<00:01:35.570> gonna<00:01:35.659> find<00:01:35.990> these

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
step basically you're gonna find these

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:37.960 
step basically you're gonna find these
tombstones<00:01:36.440> when<00:01:37.010> you<00:01:37.100> come<00:01:37.400> back<00:01:37.580> there<00:01:37.880> will

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
tombstones when you come back there will

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.670 
tombstones when you come back there will
be<00:01:38.000> three<00:01:38.420> of<00:01:38.540> them<00:01:38.690> I'm<00:01:38.869> pretty<00:01:39.140> sure<00:01:39.409> there's

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
be three of them I'm pretty sure there's

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.410 
be three of them I'm pretty sure there's
they'll<00:01:40.130> always<00:01:40.369> be<00:01:40.580> in<00:01:40.670> these<00:01:40.820> three<00:01:41.090> spots

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
they'll always be in these three spots

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.300 
they'll always be in these three spots
basically<00:01:42.020> you're<00:01:42.380> going<00:01:42.500> to<00:01:42.710> take<00:01:42.890> the<00:01:43.010> frost

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
basically you're going to take the frost

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:44.980 
basically you're going to take the frost
staff<00:01:43.580> and<00:01:43.790> just<00:01:44.030> shoot<00:01:44.270> them<00:01:44.510> you'll<00:01:44.780> know

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
staff and just shoot them you'll know

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.420 
staff and just shoot them you'll know
you've<00:01:45.229> shot<00:01:45.590> them<00:01:45.830> when<00:01:46.040> they<00:01:46.250> actually

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
you've shot them when they actually

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.300 
you've shot them when they actually
crystallize<00:01:47.360> into<00:01:47.720> a<00:01:47.900> sort<00:01:48.200> of<00:01:48.290> ice<00:01:48.500> tombstone

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
crystallize into a sort of ice tombstone

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.250 
crystallize into a sort of ice tombstone
and<00:01:49.729> once<00:01:50.000> you<00:01:50.119> have<00:01:50.240> done<00:01:50.420> that<00:01:50.450> basically

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:51.260 
and once you have done that basically

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.560 
and once you have done that basically
it's<00:01:51.590> gonna<00:01:51.799> be<00:01:52.010> quite<00:01:52.310> easy<00:01:52.610> to<00:01:52.790> do<00:01:53.090> the<00:01:53.330> next

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
it's gonna be quite easy to do the next

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.600 
it's gonna be quite easy to do the next
couple<00:01:53.990> steps<00:01:54.229> there's<00:01:54.770> three<00:01:55.159> of<00:01:55.189> them<00:01:55.369> like

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
couple steps there's three of them like

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.940 
couple steps there's three of them like
I<00:01:55.760> said<00:01:55.820> and<00:01:56.299> the<00:01:56.390> third<00:01:56.659> one<00:01:56.869> is<00:01:57.140> here<00:01:57.799> I'm

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
I said and the third one is here I'm

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.140 
I said and the third one is here I'm
just<00:01:58.130> speeding<00:01:58.310> up<00:01:58.460> the<00:01:58.610> footage<00:01:58.909> for<00:01:59.090> you

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150 
just speeding up the footage for you

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.910 
just speeding up the footage for you
guys<00:01:59.330> the<00:01:59.990> third<00:02:00.200> one<00:02:00.380> will<00:02:00.560> be<00:02:00.680> right<00:02:00.860> here

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
guys the third one will be right here

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.100 
guys the third one will be right here
just<00:02:01.400> shoot<00:02:01.670> it<00:02:01.790> with<00:02:01.909> the<00:02:02.000> frost<00:02:02.299> staff<00:02:02.600> now

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
just shoot it with the frost staff now

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:04.870 
just shoot it with the frost staff now
the<00:02:03.170> next<00:02:03.560> step<00:02:03.740> is<00:02:03.770> basically<00:02:04.100> you<00:02:04.520> have<00:02:04.729> to

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
the next step is basically you have to

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.760 
the next step is basically you have to
get<00:02:05.030> a<00:02:05.060> weapon<00:02:05.420> that<00:02:05.630> shoots<00:02:06.020> bullets<00:02:06.350> it

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
get a weapon that shoots bullets it

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.770 
get a weapon that shoots bullets it
cannot<00:02:07.130> be<00:02:07.340> the<00:02:07.460> ray<00:02:07.670> gun<00:02:07.939> it<00:02:08.149> cannot<00:02:08.509> be<00:02:08.689> the

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
cannot be the ray gun it cannot be the

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.749 
cannot be the ray gun it cannot be the
war<00:02:09.019> machine<00:02:09.379> basically<00:02:09.979> once<00:02:10.429> you've<00:02:10.580> done

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
war machine basically once you've done

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.519 
war machine basically once you've done
that<00:02:10.939> you<00:02:11.120> got<00:02:11.299> to<00:02:11.419> go<00:02:11.599> around<00:02:11.749> the<00:02:12.019> map<00:02:12.290> and

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:12.529 
that you got to go around the map and

00:02:12.529 --> 00:02:15.590 
that you got to go around the map and
just<00:02:13.010> shoot<00:02:13.310> them<00:02:13.519> again<00:02:13.969> if<00:02:14.209> you<00:02:14.359> do<00:02:14.569> have<00:02:14.779> a

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
just shoot them again if you do have a

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.630 
just shoot them again if you do have a
or<00:02:15.960> a<00:02:16.020> something<00:02:16.830> that<00:02:16.950> shoots<00:02:17.070> bullets<00:02:17.190> like

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
or a something that shoots bullets like

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.060 
or a something that shoots bullets like
a<00:02:17.700> aks-74u<00:02:18.690> what<00:02:18.840> I'm<00:02:18.960> using<00:02:19.170> just<00:02:19.440> do<00:02:19.890> that

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
a aks-74u what I'm using just do that

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.770 
a aks-74u what I'm using just do that
right<00:02:20.370> away<00:02:20.400> right<00:02:20.970> after<00:02:21.120> you<00:02:21.330> shoot<00:02:21.570> them

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
right away right after you shoot them

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.630 
right away right after you shoot them
it's<00:02:22.290> just<00:02:22.560> gotta<00:02:22.740> be<00:02:22.860> something<00:02:23.460> with

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
it's just gotta be something with

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.090 
it's just gotta be something with
bullets<00:02:24.120> or<00:02:24.330> else<00:02:24.510> it<00:02:24.720> won't<00:02:24.900> work<00:02:25.080> I'm<00:02:25.950> not

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
bullets or else it won't work I'm not

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.130 
bullets or else it won't work I'm not
sure<00:02:26.490> if<00:02:26.640> someone<00:02:26.910> else<00:02:27.180> can<00:02:27.420> shoot<00:02:27.660> them<00:02:27.840> I

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
sure if someone else can shoot them I

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.130 
sure if someone else can shoot them I
don't<00:02:28.560> think<00:02:28.800> it<00:02:28.920> matters<00:02:29.130> but<00:02:29.970> it<00:02:30.660> just<00:02:30.990> has

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
don't think it matters but it just has

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.380 
don't think it matters but it just has
to<00:02:31.290> be<00:02:31.320> like<00:02:31.650> I<00:02:31.800> said<00:02:31.830> something<00:02:32.370> with<00:02:32.820> bullets

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
to be like I said something with bullets

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.730 
to be like I said something with bullets
now<00:02:33.600> on<00:02:33.780> to<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:34.020> next<00:02:34.260> step<00:02:34.500> you're<00:02:34.620> gonna

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
now on to the next step you're gonna

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.740 
now on to the next step you're gonna
have<00:02:34.980> to<00:02:35.070> go<00:02:35.190> back<00:02:35.220> to<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:35.820> excavation<00:02:36.720> site

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
have to go back to the excavation site

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.080 
have to go back to the excavation site
and<00:02:37.260> you<00:02:37.680> have<00:02:37.710> to<00:02:38.040> find<00:02:38.280> these<00:02:38.490> sort<00:02:38.730> of<00:02:38.820> four

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
and you have to find these sort of four

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.420 
and you have to find these sort of four
switches<00:02:39.510> what<00:02:39.930> these<00:02:40.170> four<00:02:40.470> switches<00:02:40.680> do<00:02:41.220> is

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
switches what these four switches do is

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.940 
switches what these four switches do is
they<00:02:41.880> change<00:02:41.910> the<00:02:42.510> rings<00:02:42.870> on<00:02:43.230> the<00:02:43.410> inside

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
they change the rings on the inside

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.430 
they change the rings on the inside
right<00:02:44.310> there<00:02:44.370> as<00:02:44.760> you<00:02:44.910> just<00:02:45.150> saw<00:02:45.390> they<00:02:45.990> change

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
right there as you just saw they change

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.410 
right there as you just saw they change
the<00:02:46.710> Rings<00:02:47.010> and<00:02:47.340> basically<00:02:48.150> what<00:02:48.360> you're

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
the Rings and basically what you're

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.210 
the Rings and basically what you're
gonna<00:02:48.540> have<00:02:48.720> to<00:02:48.870> do<00:02:49.020> is<00:02:49.230> since<00:02:49.950> you're<00:02:50.100> doing

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
gonna have to do is since you're doing

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.460 
gonna have to do is since you're doing
the<00:02:50.400> frost<00:02:50.700> off<00:02:51.000> which<00:02:51.390> is<00:02:51.570> blue<00:02:51.870> you<00:02:52.140> have<00:02:52.320> to

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
the frost off which is blue you have to

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.640 
the frost off which is blue you have to
align<00:02:52.830> all<00:02:53.190> four<00:02:53.580> rings<00:02:53.880> to<00:02:54.240> become<00:02:54.660> a<00:02:54.960> sort<00:02:55.590> of

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
align all four rings to become a sort of

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.410 
align all four rings to become a sort of
blue<00:02:56.040> basically<00:02:56.760> once<00:02:56.970> you've<00:02:57.120> done<00:02:57.360> that

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
blue basically once you've done that

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.570 
blue basically once you've done that
that<00:02:57.810> basically<00:02:58.230> means<00:02:58.470> that<00:02:58.620> the<00:02:59.010> game<00:02:59.220> knows

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
that basically means that the game knows

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.190 
that basically means that the game knows
that<00:02:59.910> you're<00:03:00.090> going<00:03:00.240> to<00:03:00.300> upgrade<00:03:00.480> your<00:03:00.870> frost

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
that you're going to upgrade your frost

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.470 
that you're going to upgrade your frost
step<00:03:01.530> and<00:03:01.740> it's<00:03:02.250> a<00:03:02.370> very<00:03:02.610> very<00:03:02.730> simple<00:03:03.270> process

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
step and it's a very very simple process

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.390 
step and it's a very very simple process
so<00:03:03.750> once<00:03:04.170> you're<00:03:04.350> done<00:03:04.530> that<00:03:04.590> there<00:03:05.190> will<00:03:05.280> be<00:03:05.310> a

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
so once you're done that there will be a
