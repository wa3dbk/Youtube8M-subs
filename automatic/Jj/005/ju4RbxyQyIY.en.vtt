and because of that new 0 and I just

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.790 
and because of that new 0 and I just
prefer<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.600> calculate<00:00:49.019> the<00:00:49.110> bullet<00:00:49.379> drop<00:00:49.589> I

the battle that's going on around them

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.669 
the battle that's going on around them
and<00:01:45.899> picking<00:01:46.619> off<00:01:46.739> people<00:01:47.130> one<00:01:47.340> by<00:01:47.550> one

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:51.469 
and picking off people one by one
sniping<00:01:49.679> is<00:01:49.830> perhaps<00:01:49.979> my<00:01:50.369> favorite<00:01:50.399> role<00:01:51.239> to

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
sniping is perhaps my favorite role to

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.650 
sniping is perhaps my favorite role to
pick<00:01:51.690> up<00:01:51.929> when<00:01:52.590> playing<00:01:52.830> FPS<00:01:53.399> shooters<00:01:53.940> and<00:01:54.209> as

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:54.660 
pick up when playing FPS shooters and as

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.389 
pick up when playing FPS shooters and as
probably<00:01:54.959> evidenced<00:01:55.649> by<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.830> fact<00:01:56.130> that<00:01:56.250> I

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
probably evidenced by the fact that I

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.359 
probably evidenced by the fact that I
put<00:01:56.729> so<00:01:57.000> much<00:01:57.179> sniper<00:01:57.539> gameplay<00:01:57.929> in<00:01:58.380> my<00:01:58.979> videos

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
put so much sniper gameplay in my videos

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.190 
put so much sniper gameplay in my videos
there's<00:01:59.610> just<00:01:59.789> something<00:02:00.239> about<00:02:00.539> the<00:02:00.929> whole

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
there's just something about the whole

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.160 
there's just something about the whole
experience<00:02:01.470> the<00:02:02.310> sound<00:02:02.580> of<00:02:02.940> the<00:02:03.420> sniper<00:02:03.690> rifle

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
experience the sound of the sniper rifle

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.990

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
splitting through the rest of the noise

splitting through the rest of the noise
that<00:02:06.270> you<00:02:06.390> can<00:02:06.569> hear<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.080> seeing<00:02:07.619> that<00:02:07.830> kill

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
only a split second but the weight

it's a risky game to play but once

it's a risky game to play but once

you've learnt the basics it's not a role

you've learnt the basics it's not a role
that<00:03:36.430> you're<00:03:36.579> likely<00:03:36.819> to<00:03:37.030> want<00:03:37.389> to<00:03:37.629> leave<00:03:38.969> just

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:39.969 
that you're likely to want to leave just

that you're likely to want to leave just
the<00:03:40.030> other<00:03:40.180> day<00:03:40.359> I<00:03:40.599> spent<00:03:41.230> some<00:03:41.469> time<00:03:41.709> on

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
the other day I spent some time on

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.339 
the other day I spent some time on
battlefield<00:03:42.879> 3<00:03:42.939> with<00:03:43.389> the<00:03:43.419> snipers<00:03:43.989> in<00:03:44.019> that

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:44.349 
battlefield 3 with the snipers in that

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:46.409 
battlefield 3 with the snipers in that
game<00:03:44.620> and<00:03:44.859> I<00:03:45.040> don't<00:03:45.729> know<00:03:45.819> that<00:03:46.030> was<00:03:46.180> just

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:46.419 
game and I don't know that was just

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:48.449 
game and I don't know that was just
something<00:03:46.900> that<00:03:46.930> wasn't<00:03:47.290> quite<00:03:47.500> right<00:03:48.129> there

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
something that wasn't quite right there

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.789 
something that wasn't quite right there
maybe<00:03:49.060> it<00:03:49.209> was<00:03:49.329> the<00:03:49.479> lack<00:03:49.989> of<00:03:50.019> bullet<00:03:50.530> trail

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
maybe it was the lack of bullet trail

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:52.439 
maybe it was the lack of bullet trail
when<00:03:51.069> you<00:03:51.189> fire<00:03:51.489> which<00:03:51.729> I've<00:03:51.879> become<00:03:52.090> so

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:52.449 
when you fire which I've become so

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:54.990 
when you fire which I've become so
accustomed<00:03:52.599> to<00:03:53.229> in<00:03:53.489> battlefield<00:03:54.489> 4<00:03:54.549> it<00:03:54.819> just

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
accustomed to in battlefield 4 it just

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.119 
accustomed to in battlefield 4 it just
feels<00:03:55.209> that<00:03:55.479> little<00:03:56.169> bit<00:03:56.290> more<00:03:56.500> immersive<00:03:57.099> but

00:03:57.119 --> 00:03:57.129 
feels that little bit more immersive but

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:59.149 
feels that little bit more immersive but
when<00:03:57.430> the<00:03:57.549> game<00:03:57.729> first<00:03:58.120> came<00:03:58.269> out<00:03:58.689> I

00:03:59.149 --> 00:03:59.159 
when the game first came out I

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:02.550 
when the game first came out I
absolutely<00:04:00.159> hated<00:04:00.909> that<00:04:01.329> bullet<00:04:01.689> trail<00:04:01.959> you

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
absolutely hated that bullet trail you

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.689 
absolutely hated that bullet trail you
know<00:04:02.590> what<00:04:02.829> I'm<00:04:02.919> talking<00:04:03.220> about<00:04:03.280> right<00:04:03.579> it's

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:03.699 
know what I'm talking about right it's

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:05.580 
know what I'm talking about right it's
the<00:04:03.819> white<00:04:04.060> trail<00:04:04.479> behind<00:04:04.750> the<00:04:05.079> bullet<00:04:05.409> when

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
the white trail behind the bullet when

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.890 
the white trail behind the bullet when
you<00:04:05.739> fire<00:04:06.069> it's<00:04:06.579> like<00:04:06.759> tracers<00:04:07.329> on<00:04:07.479> normal

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
you fire it's like tracers on normal

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.599 
you fire it's like tracers on normal
weapons<00:04:08.229> but<00:04:08.379> for<00:04:08.409> sniper<00:04:08.769> rifles<00:04:09.280> it's<00:04:09.430> like

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:09.609 
weapons but for sniper rifles it's like

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:11.460
