we're turning that into a beautiful city
me<00:01:52.560> that<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:53.250> heart<00:01:53.490> of<00:01:53.790> what<00:01:54.000> we<00:01:54.149> should<00:01:54.360> be

me that the heart of what we should be

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.420 
me that the heart of what we should be
doing<00:01:54.540> is<00:01:54.990> thinking<00:01:55.439> about<00:01:55.740> how<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.070> city

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
doing is thinking about how the city

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.700 
doing is thinking about how the city
looks<00:01:56.729> how<00:01:56.880> it<00:01:57.000> feels<00:01:57.270> for<00:01:57.420> residents<00:01:58.079> the

before<00:02:17.320> through<00:02:17.620> a<00:02:17.650> lot<00:02:17.830> of<00:02:17.860> these<00:02:18.070> projects

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
before through a lot of these projects

before through a lot of these projects
growth<00:02:18.850> here<00:02:19.270> and<00:02:19.480> around<00:02:19.690> the<00:02:19.900> world<00:02:19.930> is<00:02:20.380> that

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
growth here and around the world is that

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.850 
growth here and around the world is that
these<00:02:21.280> projects<00:02:21.910> are<00:02:22.120> never<00:02:22.780> as<00:02:23.050> problematic

these projects are never as problematic

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.340

as<00:02:24.190> they<00:02:24.430> see<00:02:24.490> and<00:02:24.970> when<00:02:25.450> you<00:02:25.480> go<00:02:25.570> when<00:02:26.020> we<00:02:26.110> come

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
as they see and when you go when we come

as they see and when you go when we come
back<00:02:26.560> in<00:02:26.860> a<00:02:27.250> number<00:02:27.520> of<00:02:27.550> years<00:02:28.230> my<00:02:29.230> guess<00:02:29.470> is

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
back in a number of years my guess is

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.890 
back in a number of years my guess is
that<00:02:29.740> a<00:02:29.980> perhaps<00:02:30.190> will<00:02:30.550> not<00:02:30.700> have<00:02:30.850> been<00:02:30.900> the

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
that a perhaps will not have been the

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.810 
that a perhaps will not have been the
absolute<00:02:32.050> best<00:02:32.800> that<00:02:33.100> it<00:02:33.190> could<00:02:33.370> have<00:02:33.490> been<00:02:33.610> as

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
absolute best that it could have been as

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.340 
absolute best that it could have been as
envisioned<00:02:34.390> in<00:02:34.480> the<00:02:34.540> document<00:02:35.050> but<00:02:35.230> it

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
envisioned in the document but it

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.290 
envisioned in the document but it
certainly<00:02:35.590> will<00:02:35.980> be<00:02:36.100> nowhere<00:02:36.310> near<00:02:36.489> as<00:02:36.910> bad<00:02:37.060> as

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
certainly will be nowhere near as bad as

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.300 
certainly will be nowhere near as bad as
some<00:02:37.450> people<00:02:37.750> have<00:02:37.840> predicted<00:02:38.350> I<00:02:38.530> also<00:02:38.980> know

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
some people have predicted I also know

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.070 
some people have predicted I also know
that<00:02:39.340> this<00:02:39.820> project<00:02:40.060> will<00:02:40.420> take<00:02:40.630> a<00:02:40.660> number<00:02:40.870> of

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
that this project will take a number of

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.580 
that this project will take a number of
years<00:02:41.320> to<00:02:41.560> get<00:02:41.830> going<00:02:42.250> which<00:02:42.670> gives<00:02:42.940> us<00:02:43.209> a

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
years to get going which gives us a

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.229 
years to get going which gives us a
great<00:02:44.590> chance<00:02:44.920> to<00:02:45.100> continue<00:02:45.370> to<00:02:45.640> expand<00:02:46.060> our

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
great chance to continue to expand our

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:49.620 
great chance to continue to expand our
