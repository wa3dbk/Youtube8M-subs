 from guillermo del toro when from sea 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.860
 the depths have risen the legions of monsters 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.930
 known which tooth 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.910
 the war began which was destined 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.340
 take millions of lives and bring 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.390
 human resources almost to zero to 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.120
 fight aliens 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.910
 special weapons were created huge 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.530
 robots called jagger my managed 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.809
 these robots using two pilots 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.609
 united consciousness but even power 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.739
 jaggers were not enough to 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.019
 crush a powerful alien enemy and 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.850
 they died one by one so or 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.320
 causing considerable damage to Depart 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.110
 but desperate times require desperate 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.030
 measures and non-standard approach and the characters 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.250
 obtained from those from whom 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.689
 absolutely not waiting for these heroes was 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.939
 destined to be two completely 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.369
 extraordinary people to the former pilot and 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.080
 to a very young intern they were the ones who took 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.270
 management of one obsolete 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.119
 jagger model and it was them 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.340
 destined to change the course of the war 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:31.140
 that is, even an inexperienced one understands 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.210
 that this movie is a cocktail 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.670
 mixed in from the more famous and old 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.960
 creations of past years can be seen here 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.970
 echoes of godzilla 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.430
 in the form of huge monsters emerging from 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.470

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.790

00:03:54.010 --> 00:04:00.370
 nobody they are 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:01.770
 we always thought that the aliens would arrive 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:06.510
 to us from distant stars 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:06.510
 but they came to us from the depths of the sea 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.680
 an entity from another dimension 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:18.459
 discovered us they expected that people 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.049
 hide 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.049
 surrender to faint 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:35.660
 deep water they didn't even think that we 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:39.159
 will be able to put up withstand that 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.159

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.810
 today we will boldly meet monsters 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:29.760
