00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:14.700
 klassikers jump'n'run the motto here 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:17.699
 Some may say that is always 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.770
 the same with the others goes the heart 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.920
 only at the sound of the name on super 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.800
 mario mothers know him kings 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.460
 him children know him and i know him 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.650
 on and you hello where did it all start 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.360
 The rum hopped the fire ball attachment 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.360
 stomp the kumba 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.920

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.930
 Mustached Italian plumber 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:46.909
 the nintendo entertainment system shortly 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:49.879
 ms 1985 super mario bros 

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:52.399
 sold a good 40 million times one 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:55.430
 small number today's shooter played by 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:57.079
 real 13-year-old gamers look at it 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.269
 their five to ten million sales 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.070
 quite stupid from the laundry but clear 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:02.809
 Nintendo is only for kids if that 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.390
 that's how i like to be a child and become 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:08.390
 hopefully always stay but back 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.700
 to the red sea mario super mario bros 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.340
 still got two on the same console 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.729
 successor super mario bros two and 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.170
 three for two, something new 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:20.659
 tried and by fans rather than 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.130
 tasteless could have been better used 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:23.659
 he third part of all expectations 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.460
 surpass and is still considered one today 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.179
 the best even if I even as a number 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:31.369
 one in the genre of running and jumping 

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:33.500
 the three super mario bros titles were like that 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.299
 popular in a reissue for 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.049
 the super nintendo and the wii 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:38.899
 appeared 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:41.659
 it was exactly the same play was 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:43.219
 Graphic permanent face lifting and also 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:45.009
 Today you can still see the first and 

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:47.450
 third part of the series play wonderfully 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:49.280
 not only the nostalgia makes it possible 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.409
 but also the incomparable 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.020
 gameplay and the varied 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:55.520
 levels and to whom we owe it all 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.469
 shigeru miyamoto 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.210
 okay all alone he has the whole thing too 

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:00.649
 not made but he is and remains 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.229
 Just hold a god when it comes to 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:05.119
 Video games , the opera is every one 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.000

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.069
 I hope I could all those who like 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.630
 myself after super mario bros 1 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.640
 were born to bring the game closer 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.709

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.700
 I hope you forgive me visually 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.890
 but quite simple representation and takes 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.750
 that not everyone has such great videos 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.980
