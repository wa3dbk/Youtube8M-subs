00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.199
 Several of you asked me to 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.850
 will explain how this type of 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.340
 furniture or rather how that is done 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:35.670
 technique and the truth that technique is super 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.680
 easy and they will look super original 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.170
 creative furniture really very very 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.269
 expensive because but I'm telling you because 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.370
 how short to make this piece of furniture 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:46.350
 to need three colors three types of 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.870
 paint and then explain right now in this 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.969
 video as ready let's start to 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.469
 make our vintage furniture 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.969
 well I will explain them with the technique 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.440
 We will cover very well with our 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.260
 newspaper of preference that are the 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.510
 local news I'll explain 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.250
 with a piece of wood how is it going to 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.449
 do and I told them that we are going to 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.520
 need painting 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.770
 this is the color of the painting I do not know what 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:11.340
 color be but if you want to know this is 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:14.350
 the code that comes in the latita we're going to 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.200
 go putting it on and we're going to cover 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.750
 the wood has to be totally 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.880
 raw that means that it is not 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.310
 varnished or that has other things 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.190
 let's have our wood ready and painted 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:30.130
 let's wait for it to dry 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:33.460
 about an hour is already 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.259
 completely dry our wood and now 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:39.399
 yes ready let's start working with 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:41.560
 this is going to occupy white paint and what 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:46.360
 what we have to do is 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:49.400
 brush down without any side without having 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.350
 as a pattern or a roll 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.560
 and this after it has already been 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:57.140
 dried our table as you see is already 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.210
 completely dry we will put a color 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.960
 for this I used as this color that 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.940
 it is more or less mint this and it is a color 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.460
 that I was looking for and so that I 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:11.330
 pleased and we are going to give him a few strokes 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:14.210
 with our this painting that is going to 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.420
 remain of this color is what is more 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.420
 will notice 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.840
 and 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:32.410
 and here the wood completely dry and 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.780
 what we are going to need is going to be a 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.150
 stanza a scourer of these I do not know how 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.950
 they're called but aluminum are for 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.980
 wash the dishes and what we are going to do 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:45.190
 is let's start carving 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:48.690
 a very peculiar way that there is like 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.690
 worn areas 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.450
 for example here is a worn area 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:00.000
 and this has already left our wood 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.230
 totally steel and it's the only thing 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.510
 you have to do is you're simply going to 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.360
 grab a spoil a scourer like 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.980
 these and you're going to start carving carving and 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.950
 this is how they could realize 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.650
 how the effect is made then up 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.569
 here our wood list and so it is 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:19.050
 as more or less I did to him to do 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:20.940
 this furniture with those details and if you 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:24.330
 like this color so you can try 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:26.130
 but you can also work the one you 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.830
 combine other colors normally in 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:31.140
 these furniture are very combined with 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.060
 the fact of being old but with 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.950
 current colors really this is a 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.870
 A little more precision is a little 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:40.319
 more d 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:43.379
 to take it easy and be struggling 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:46.560
 and leaving and leaving and sanding is here 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:48.959
 here in this I gave the trail a little more 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.030
 because it's supposed to be like there's 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:52.830
 more use the guys would be all about how 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.409
 to be able to make a vintage furniture from your 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:57.540
 house and very simple and very practical gas
