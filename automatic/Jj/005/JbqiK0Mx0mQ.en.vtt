00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:33.280 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:42.420 

it's<00:00:33.880> a<00:00:34.090> little<00:00:34.390> fine<00:00:34.720> frame<00:00:35.140> nuke<00:00:37.170> that

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.430 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.610 

I<00:00:42.460> just<00:00:43.120> pretty<00:00:43.330> hearing<00:00:43.900> in<00:00:44.170> the<00:00:44.470> bee<00:00:45.010> yard

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
I just pretty hearing in the bee yard

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.710 
I just pretty hearing in the bee yard
you<00:00:47.620> can<00:00:47.770> see<00:00:49.560> they're<00:00:50.560> pretty<00:00:51.550> nice<00:00:51.850> peas<00:00:52.300> so

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:52.720 
you can see they're pretty nice peas so

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:58.069 
you can see they're pretty nice peas so
far

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.650 

you'll<00:00:58.649> enter<00:00:58.800> all<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.399> cones<00:00:59.670> very<00:01:00.239> straight

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
you'll enter all the cones very straight

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.240 
you'll enter all the cones very straight
which<00:01:01.020> squeezes<00:01:01.410> me<00:01:02.720> and<00:01:04.070> strangely<00:01:05.070> enough

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
which squeezes me and strangely enough

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.290 
which squeezes me and strangely enough
and<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:07.940> regular<00:01:08.940> comb<00:01:09.600> that<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:09.930> put<00:01:10.229> in<00:01:10.409> here

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:11.300 
and the regular comb that I put in here

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:22.539 
and the regular comb that I put in here
rather<00:01:12.300> than

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.549 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:24.969 

rather<00:01:23.119> than<00:01:23.450> put<00:01:23.840> brooding<00:01:24.380> if<00:01:24.530> they<00:01:24.710> won't

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
rather than put brooding if they won't

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:29.319 
rather than put brooding if they won't
and<00:01:25.490> filled<00:01:25.880> it<00:01:26.030> with<00:01:26.060> honey<00:01:27.790> that's<00:01:28.790> right

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:29.329 
and filled it with honey that's right

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:34.209 
and filled it with honey that's right
here<00:01:29.630> in<00:01:29.659> the<00:01:29.869> middle

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:34.219 

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:37.440 

and<00:01:34.399> as<00:01:34.609> you<00:01:34.789> can<00:01:34.969> see

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.700 

maybe<00:01:38.080> not<00:01:38.350> the<00:01:38.530> best<00:01:38.560> fruit<00:01:39.040> better

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.190 

but<00:01:43.310> they<00:01:43.549> are<00:01:43.760> laying<00:01:44.150> eggs<00:01:44.479> have<00:01:44.780> been<00:01:44.990> at<00:01:45.170> it

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
but they are laying eggs have been at it

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:57.550 
but they are laying eggs have been at it
for<00:01:45.350> a<00:01:45.619> while

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.500 

okay<00:01:58.310> there

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:01.510 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:07.160 

and<00:02:01.630> swing<00:02:01.870> a<00:02:01.990> traffic

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.790 

two<00:02:07.740> things<00:02:07.979> okay

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.460 

for<00:02:13.360> getting<00:02:14.360> these<00:02:14.510> out<00:02:14.870> of<00:02:15.050> the<00:02:15.110> middle<00:02:15.380> of

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
for getting these out of the middle of

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.970 
for getting these out of the middle of
the<00:02:15.560> woods

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
the woods

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:26.070 
the woods
this<00:02:16.190> is<00:02:18.250> really<00:02:19.250> very<00:02:19.610> nice<00:02:23.200> that's<00:02:24.200> why<00:02:24.560> my

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
this is really very nice that's why my

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:33.990 
this is really very nice that's why my
hypothesis<00:02:27.080> is<00:02:28.810> that<00:02:29.890> the<00:02:30.890> natural<00:02:31.430> state<00:02:31.790> of

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
hypothesis is that the natural state of

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.180 
hypothesis is that the natural state of
apis<00:02:35.000> mellifera<00:02:35.230> is<00:02:36.230> a<00:02:36.830> very<00:02:37.460> gentle<00:02:39.190> insect

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
apis mellifera is a very gentle insect

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.210 
apis mellifera is a very gentle insect
not<00:02:40.460> unlike<00:02:40.880> the<00:02:41.060> cap<00:02:41.330> has<00:02:42.170> the<00:02:42.440> potential<00:02:42.890> to

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
not unlike the cap has the potential to

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.600 
not unlike the cap has the potential to
grow<00:02:43.490> including<00:02:43.760> finger<00:02:44.540> but<00:02:45.190> prefers<00:02:46.190> to

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
grow including finger but prefers to

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:58.800 
grow including finger but prefers to
stay<00:02:46.670> out<00:02:47.030> of

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:07.960 

unless<00:02:59.560> there's<00:02:59.890> some<00:03:00.250> external<00:03:00.819> influence

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:14.920 

in<00:03:08.540> the<00:03:08.660> middle<00:03:08.930> of<00:03:09.020> affluence<00:03:09.530> here's<00:03:09.830> a<00:03:09.950> walk

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:47.760 

a<00:03:14.989> lot<00:03:15.530> of<00:03:15.560> men

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:47.770 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:54.550 

oh<00:03:47.860> there<00:03:48.580> you<00:03:48.820> all<00:03:48.880> go

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.070 

maybe<00:03:55.310> we'll<00:03:55.490> make<00:03:55.730> a<00:03:55.790> new<00:03:56.030> cover<00:03:56.360> for<00:03:56.720> when<00:03:56.900> we

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.080 
maybe we'll make a new cover for when we

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.970 
maybe we'll make a new cover for when we
just<00:03:57.350> cover<00:03:57.620> them<00:03:57.890> up<00:03:58.070> a<00:03:58.250> piece<00:03:58.550> of<00:03:58.580> plywood
