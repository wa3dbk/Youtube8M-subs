00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.100
- Me and my boyfriend Tomu are heading to the school.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.340
- Our Japanese school will have an festival today.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.580
- We are exited what we are gonna do today.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.120
This is our classroom where we have our classes.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.260
Because of the school festival our classroom is quite messy.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:36.460
An Japanese Design school did visit our school.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.060
They where talking about Japanese fashion and about the future jobs.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.320
After the presentation we did some collage and talked about it infront of everybody.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.400
Our theme of this collage was "going out whit friends".

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.820
This was so fun!

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.780
The Japanese teachers was so impressed about Tomus collage.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.720
Back at our classroom.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:32.780
We had the chance to try a lot of Japanese toys and games.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.520
This was not easy at all.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:54.540
So I gave up.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:06.580
Tomu was much better than me.

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:17.000
Time to do some cool calligraphy.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.960
Tomu did a symbol of money.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:42.840
And I did the symbol of "to eat food".

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:58.220
The teacher did like my Kanji.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:22.880
The Kanji for Monday.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:31.600
Everyone did their best!

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:20.420
- At our classroom again and today is the last day as level 1 students.

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:27.260

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:52.080
-The funniest event today was the Japanese games.

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:04.320
It was hard to video everything, special the Japanese games.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.860
