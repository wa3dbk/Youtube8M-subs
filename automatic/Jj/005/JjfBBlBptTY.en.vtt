to<00:02:42.970> do<00:02:43.120> it<00:02:43.230> this<00:02:44.230> is<00:02:44.290> one<00:02:44.620> of<00:02:44.650> those<00:02:44.830> things

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
to do it this is one of those things

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.730 
to do it this is one of those things
where<00:02:45.730> it<00:02:46.390> really<00:02:46.690> does<00:02:46.990> come<00:02:47.260> down<00:02:47.290> to<00:02:47.440> what's

up<00:03:05.160> now<00:03:06.160> if<00:03:06.580> your<00:03:07.090> nail<00:03:07.450> beds<00:03:07.660> are<00:03:07.840> not<00:03:08.050> all<00:03:08.290> the

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
up now if your nail beds are not all the

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.760 
up now if your nail beds are not all the
same<00:03:08.500> length<00:03:09.040> you<00:03:10.000> can<00:03:10.360> kind<00:03:10.959> of<00:03:11.050> fake<00:03:11.320> it<00:03:11.350> by

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
same length you can kind of fake it by

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.699 
same length you can kind of fake it by
making<00:03:12.040> some<00:03:12.660> maybe<00:03:13.660> thicker<00:03:14.080> then<00:03:14.590> they

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
making some maybe thicker then they

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:18.090 
making some maybe thicker then they
naturally<00:03:15.250> are<00:03:15.280> if<00:03:16.020> your<00:03:17.020> nail<00:03:17.680> beds<00:03:17.920> are<00:03:18.070> very

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
naturally are if your nail beds are very

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.940 
naturally are if your nail beds are very
small<00:03:18.820> and<00:03:19.209> you<00:03:20.080> want<00:03:20.260> to<00:03:20.380> make<00:03:20.530> the<00:03:20.650> free<00:03:20.860> edge

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
small and you want to make the free edge

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.150 
small and you want to make the free edge
look<00:03:21.220> smaller<00:03:21.850> than<00:03:22.150> it<00:03:22.239> actually<00:03:22.420> is<00:03:22.720> I<00:03:23.230> would

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
look smaller than it actually is I would

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.130 
look smaller than it actually is I would
recommend<00:03:24.640> starting<00:03:24.910> off<00:03:25.330> with<00:03:25.570> like<00:03:25.810> an

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
recommend starting off with like an

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.570 
recommend starting off with like an
opaque<00:03:26.860> pink<00:03:27.340> as<00:03:27.549> your<00:03:28.030> base<00:03:28.209> color<00:03:28.570> and<00:03:28.870> then

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
opaque pink as your base color and then

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.420 
opaque pink as your base color and then
you<00:03:30.580> can<00:03:30.880> create<00:03:31.780> the<00:03:31.900> white<00:03:32.140> part<00:03:32.530> not<00:03:33.190> as

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
you can create the white part not as

00:03:33.430 --> 00:04:04.210 
you can create the white part not as
long<00:03:34.030> as<00:03:34.360> your<00:03:34.570> natural<00:03:34.989> nails

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.160 

now<00:04:05.220> if<00:04:05.670> you<00:04:05.880> like<00:04:06.090> the<00:04:06.240> color<00:04:06.420> your<00:04:06.720> nail<00:04:06.900> beds

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
now if you like the color your nail beds

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.750 
now if you like the color your nail beds
and<00:04:07.500> you<00:04:07.590> want<00:04:07.800> to<00:04:07.890> keep<00:04:08.040> the<00:04:08.190> tip<00:04:08.400> really

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
and you want to keep the tip really

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.580 
and you want to keep the tip really
crisp<00:04:09.150> white<00:04:09.450> you<00:04:09.660> could<00:04:09.840> skip<00:04:10.140> this<00:04:10.320> next

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
crisp white you could skip this next

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.220 
crisp white you could skip this next
step<00:04:10.920> but<00:04:11.670> I'm<00:04:11.790> going<00:04:12.060> to<00:04:12.150> add<00:04:12.270> one<00:04:12.690> coat<00:04:12.990> of

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
step but I'm going to add one coat of

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.600 
step but I'm going to add one coat of
wondrous<00:04:13.740> which<00:04:14.190> is<00:04:14.370> a<00:04:14.400> very<00:04:14.700> sheer<00:04:15.180> pink<00:04:15.630> and

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:16.610 
wondrous which is a very sheer pink and

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:19.220 
wondrous which is a very sheer pink and
that<00:04:17.610> will<00:04:18.120> just<00:04:18.330> add<00:04:18.480> a<00:04:18.600> little<00:04:18.989> bit<00:04:19.080> more

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.230 
that will just add a little bit more

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.370 
that will just add a little bit more
pink<00:04:19.470> to<00:04:19.739> the<00:04:19.860> nail<00:04:20.040> bed<00:04:20.360> it<00:04:21.360> will<00:04:21.660> tent<00:04:22.110> the

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
pink to the nail bed it will tent the

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.280 
pink to the nail bed it will tent the
white<00:04:22.620> but<00:04:22.950> only<00:04:23.160> just<00:04:23.460> slightly<00:04:23.940> and<00:04:24.390> I<00:04:24.930> feel

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
white but only just slightly and I feel

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.160 
white but only just slightly and I feel
like<00:04:25.470> it<00:04:25.620> actually<00:04:25.770> helps<00:04:26.340> to<00:04:26.900> kind<00:04:27.900> of<00:04:27.960> hide

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.170 
like it actually helps to kind of hide

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.280 
like it actually helps to kind of hide
some<00:04:28.500> of<00:04:28.590> the<00:04:28.650> brushstrokes<00:04:29.280> and<00:04:30.050> just<00:04:31.050> gives

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
some of the brushstrokes and just gives

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:41.120 
some of the brushstrokes and just gives
it<00:04:31.410> an<00:04:31.530> overall<00:04:31.680> more<00:04:32.280> finished<00:04:32.730> look<00:04:32.850> for<00:04:40.130> my

of this length this is really the only

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.370 
of this length this is really the only
length<00:05:08.730> that<00:05:09.000> I<00:05:09.060> would<00:05:09.330> wear<00:05:09.660> a<00:05:10.050> traditional

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380

you<00:05:14.340> know<00:05:14.460> once<00:05:14.730> my<00:05:14.910> nails<00:05:15.090> start<00:05:15.420> to<00:05:15.570> get

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750 
you know once my nails start to get

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.900 
you know once my nails start to get
longer<00:05:16.200> than<00:05:16.350> that<00:05:16.620> I'm<00:05:16.980> more<00:05:17.310> likely<00:05:17.640> to<00:05:17.760> go

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:17.910 
longer than that I'm more likely to go

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.240 
longer than that I'm more likely to go
for<00:05:17.940> a<00:05:18.300> funky<00:05:18.750> French<00:05:19.080> something<00:05:19.620> you<00:05:20.160> know

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
for a funky French something you know

with<00:05:20.400> a<00:05:20.430> black<00:05:20.760> tip<00:05:21.150> or<00:05:21.690> maybe<00:05:22.440> a<00:05:22.530> white<00:05:22.860> tip

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:23.220 
with a black tip or maybe a white tip

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.130 
with a black tip or maybe a white tip
but<00:05:23.550> a<00:05:23.580> sheer<00:05:23.880> blue<00:05:24.240> over<00:05:24.510> the<00:05:24.600> top<00:05:24.840> rather

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:25.140 
but a sheer blue over the top rather

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:27.980 
but a sheer blue over the top rather

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
than a pink or something even more

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:29.870 
than a pink or something even more
