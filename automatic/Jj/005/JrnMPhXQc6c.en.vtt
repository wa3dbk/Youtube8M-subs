improved clinch knot of braid it's a

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:13.759 
improved clinch knot of braid it's a
little<00:00:13.080> bit<00:00:13.170> different<00:00:13.469> when<00:00:13.559> we're<00:00:13.710> using

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
little bit different when we're using

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.340 
little bit different when we're using
braid<00:00:14.099> to<00:00:14.250> using<00:00:14.490> mono<00:00:14.670> we<00:00:15.540> use<00:00:15.690> this<00:00:15.929> knot<00:00:16.170> a

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
braid to using mono we use this knot a

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.630 
braid to using mono we use this knot a
lot<00:00:16.650> when<00:00:16.800> we're<00:00:16.920> like<00:00:17.070> baiting<00:00:17.369> for<00:00:17.400> king

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
fish in the shallow water we need to

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.230 
fish in the shallow water we need to
have<00:00:18.960> a<00:00:18.990> balloon<00:00:19.320> on<00:00:19.590> our<00:00:19.949> rig<00:00:20.160> we<00:00:20.850> start<00:00:21.119> off

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
have a balloon on our rig we start off

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.300 
have a balloon on our rig we start off
tying<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.869> knot<00:00:22.050> simply<00:00:22.529> by<00:00:22.680> poking<00:00:22.949> the

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
tying the knot simply by poking the

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.070 
tying the knot simply by poking the
braid<00:00:23.970> through<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.750> swivel<00:00:26.480> and<00:00:27.480> then<00:00:27.630> close

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
braid through the swivel and then close

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.000 
braid through the swivel and then close
to<00:00:28.230> your<00:00:28.349> swivel<00:00:28.619> you're<00:00:28.710> just<00:00:28.830> going<00:00:28.949> to

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
to your swivel you're just going to

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.140 
to your swivel you're just going to
pinch<00:00:29.220> with<00:00:29.340> your<00:00:29.400> thumb<00:00:29.609> and<00:00:29.730> forefinger

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
pinch with your thumb and forefinger

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.720 
pinch with your thumb and forefinger
there<00:00:30.990> like<00:00:31.199> that<00:00:31.380> so<00:00:31.619> that<00:00:31.769> when<00:00:31.890> you're<00:00:32.009> when

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
there like that so that when you're when

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:33.889 
there like that so that when you're when
you're<00:00:32.759> really<00:00:33.059> finished<00:00:33.390> doing<00:00:33.570> your<00:00:33.630> loops

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
you're really finished doing your loops

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.810 
you're really finished doing your loops
you've<00:00:34.590> just<00:00:34.770> created<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:35.219> little<00:00:35.460> loop<00:00:35.610> there

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
you've just created a little loop there

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.010 
you've just created a little loop there
at<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.000> end<00:00:36.149> so<00:00:36.360> you've<00:00:36.510> got<00:00:36.660> something<00:00:36.930> to

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
at the end so you've got something to

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.350 
at the end so you've got something to
put<00:00:37.200> you<00:00:37.380> your<00:00:37.950> tag<00:00:38.160> through<00:00:38.460> if<00:00:38.910> you<00:00:39.030> just<00:00:39.180> do

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
put you your tag through if you just do

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.459 
put you your tag through if you just do
like<00:00:39.540> this<00:00:39.719> it<00:00:39.930> just<00:00:40.200> gets<00:00:40.379> too<00:00:40.559> hard<00:00:42.260> so<00:00:43.260> just

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
like this it just gets too hard so just

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.760 
like this it just gets too hard so just
pinching<00:00:43.800> there<00:00:44.329> creating<00:00:45.329> that<00:00:45.420> loop<00:00:45.770> then

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
pinching there creating that loop then

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.170 
pinching there creating that loop then
we're<00:00:46.890> going<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.039> wrap<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.370> line<00:00:47.520> around<00:00:47.579> the

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
we're going to wrap the line around the

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:57.619 
we're going to wrap the line around the
main<00:00:48.360> line<00:00:48.390> 20<00:00:48.930> times<00:00:54.739> 19<00:00:55.739> 20<00:00:56.449> once<00:00:57.449> you've

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
main line 20 times 19 20 once you've

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.470 
main line 20 times 19 20 once you've
done<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:57.870> we're<00:00:58.289> going<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.469> use<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.739> tag<00:00:59.039> in

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
done that we're going to use the tag in

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.970 
done that we're going to use the tag in
put<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.600> tag<00:01:00.840> in<00:01:01.050> through<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.500> loop<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:01.710> you

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
put the tag in through the loop that you

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.260 
put the tag in through the loop that you
created<00:01:02.280> when<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.460> pinched<00:01:02.789> up<00:01:02.879> beside<00:01:03.149> the

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
created when you pinched up beside the

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.479 
created when you pinched up beside the
swivel<00:01:03.680> that's<00:01:04.680> going<00:01:04.920> through<00:01:05.159> there<00:01:05.339> like

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
swivel that's going through there like

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.190 
swivel that's going through there like
that<00:01:05.640> then<00:01:06.390> when<00:01:06.540> you've<00:01:06.659> done<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:06.900> you've

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
that then when you've done that you've

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.440 
that then when you've done that you've
just<00:01:07.380> created<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.860> loop<00:01:08.040> here<00:01:08.280> I'm<00:01:09.150> just<00:01:09.270> going

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
just created a loop here I'm just going

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.210 
just created a loop here I'm just going
to<00:01:09.479> bring<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.780> tag<00:01:10.020> in<00:01:10.260> back<00:01:10.830> through<00:01:11.070> that

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
to bring the tag in back through that

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.999 
to bring the tag in back through that
loop<00:01:11.400> as<00:01:11.580> well<00:01:13.400> now<00:01:14.400> is<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.610> tricky<00:01:14.909> part<00:01:16.009> but

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
loop as well now is the tricky part but

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.859 
loop as well now is the tricky part but
not<00:01:17.189> as<00:01:17.400> only<00:01:17.640> as<00:01:17.909> good<00:01:18.090> as<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.390> way<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.659> lines

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
not as only as good as the way the lines

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.810 
not as only as good as the way the lines
pack<00:01:19.170> down<00:01:19.439> when<00:01:19.950> you're<00:01:20.130> when<00:01:20.400> you<00:01:20.490> bring<00:01:20.670> the

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
pack down when you're when you bring the

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.120 
pack down when you're when you bring the
knockdown<00:01:21.000> all<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.840> little<00:01:22.500> loops<00:01:22.799> around

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
knockdown all the little loops around

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.980 
knockdown all the little loops around
the<00:01:23.220> line<00:01:23.369> they<00:01:24.000> need<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.270> pack<00:01:24.479> up<00:01:24.659> beside

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
the line they need to pack up beside

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.630 
the line they need to pack up beside
each<00:01:25.020> other<00:01:25.320> they<00:01:25.470> can't<00:01:25.740> overlap<00:01:26.220> on<00:01:26.369> top<00:01:26.520> of

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
each other if they do that you're not

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.130 
each other if they do that you're not
going<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.159> break<00:01:29.369> it<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.729> lot<00:01:29.939> less<00:01:30.210> than<00:01:30.479> then

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
going to break it a lot less than then

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.679 
going to break it a lot less than then
the<00:01:31.229> line<00:01:31.409> strength<00:01:31.710> itself<00:01:32.090> so<00:01:33.090> it's<00:01:33.420> just<00:01:33.540> a

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
the line strength itself so it's just a

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:39.350 
the line strength itself so it's just a
matter<00:01:33.720> of<00:01:33.960> just<00:01:34.049> slowly<00:01:34.560> working<00:01:34.950> it<00:01:35.189> down

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.830 

and<00:01:39.780> as<00:01:40.020> you're<00:01:40.200> going<00:01:40.230> you<00:01:40.950> just<00:01:41.840> select

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
and as you're going you just select

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.300 
and as you're going you just select
stretching<00:01:43.230> the<00:01:43.290> night<00:01:43.470> out<00:01:43.590> or<00:01:43.710> untwisting

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
stretching the night out or untwisting

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.220 
stretching the night out or untwisting
over<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:44.520> little<00:01:44.640> bit<00:01:44.850> making<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.810> lot<00:01:45.960> not

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:46.230 
over a little bit making the lot not

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:47.890 
over a little bit making the lot not
longer<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:46.770> leaner

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
longer and leaner

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.270 
longer and leaner
the<00:01:48.900> finished<00:01:49.260> night<00:01:49.470> you<00:01:49.620> want<00:01:49.770> as<00:01:49.860> long<00:01:50.070> and

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
the finished night you want as long and

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.040 
the finished night you want as long and

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
as lean as possible if it's all short

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:53.540 
as lean as possible if it's all short
and<00:01:52.170> bunched<00:01:52.560> up<00:01:52.650> on<00:01:52.800> the<00:01:52.860> at<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.280> end<00:01:53.370> of<00:01:53.490> a

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:53.550 
and bunched up on the at the end of a

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.120 
and bunched up on the at the end of a
swivel<00:01:53.850> here<00:01:54.060> that's<00:01:54.570> when<00:01:54.750> you<00:01:54.870> tie<00:01:55.830> it<00:01:55.890> wrong

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
swivel here that's when you tie it wrong

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.330 
swivel here that's when you tie it wrong
I<00:01:56.280> guess<00:01:56.840> so<00:01:57.840> just<00:01:58.020> again<00:01:58.740> it's<00:01:58.950> just<00:01:58.980> slowly

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
I guess so just again it's just slowly

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.580 
I guess so just again it's just slowly
just<00:01:59.640> moving<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:00.120> down<00:02:00.320> stretching<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.440> night

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
just moving it down stretching the night

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:09.139 
just moving it down stretching the night
out<00:02:02.570> making<00:02:03.570> sure<00:02:03.690> nothing<00:02:03.900> overlaps<00:02:08.149> and

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
out making sure nothing overlaps and

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.510 
out making sure nothing overlaps and
twisting<00:02:09.720> it<00:02:09.920> trying<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:10.979> make<00:02:11.070> it<00:02:11.280> a<00:02:11.340> bit

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
twisting it trying to make it a bit

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:17.540 
twisting it trying to make it a bit
longer<00:02:15.680> it's<00:02:16.680> really<00:02:16.950> important<00:02:17.340> that<00:02:17.430> you

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
longer it's really important that you

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.250 
longer it's really important that you
just<00:02:17.580> take<00:02:17.850> your<00:02:18.000> time<00:02:18.060> at<00:02:18.390> this<00:02:18.480> at<00:02:19.080> this

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
just take your time at this at this

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.380 
just take your time at this at this
point<00:02:19.500> of<00:02:19.650> it<00:02:19.740> once<00:02:20.640> it<00:02:20.760> starts<00:02:21.000> to<00:02:21.030> get<00:02:21.150> a<00:02:21.209> bit

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
point of it once it starts to get a bit

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.090 
point of it once it starts to get a bit
tight<00:02:21.600> it's<00:02:22.080> always<00:02:22.260> a<00:02:22.290> good<00:02:22.470> idea<00:02:22.530> to<00:02:22.800> put<00:02:23.070> a

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
tight it's always a good idea to put a

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:35.589 
tight it's always a good idea to put a
bit<00:02:23.250> of<00:02:23.280> lube<00:02:23.490> on<00:02:23.640> it<00:02:24.950> stop<00:02:25.950> being<00:02:26.190> in<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.400> line

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.929 

like<00:02:36.599> that

00:02:37.929 --> 00:02:37.939 
like that

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:40.160 
like that
let<00:02:38.939> me<00:02:39.000> just<00:02:39.180> apply<00:02:39.510> a<00:02:39.540> bit<00:02:39.719> more<00:02:39.780> pressure

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
let me just apply a bit more pressure

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.199 
let me just apply a bit more pressure
and<00:02:43.040> just<00:02:44.040> at<00:02:44.459> the<00:02:44.489> end<00:02:44.760> you<00:02:44.849> just<00:02:45.030> want<00:02:45.180> to

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
and just at the end you just want to

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.569 
and just at the end you just want to
give<00:02:45.359> it<00:02:45.480> that<00:02:45.510> final<00:02:45.930> good<00:02:46.409> pull<00:02:47.250> and<00:02:47.280> you'll

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
give it that final good pull and you'll

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:56.000 
give it that final good pull and you'll
just<00:02:47.879> see<00:02:48.180> it<00:02:48.209> all<00:02:48.390> tighten<00:02:48.930> up<00:02:54.709> you<00:02:55.709> look<00:02:55.890> at

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
just see it all tighten up you look at

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.470 
just see it all tighten up you look at
that<00:02:56.129> you<00:02:56.280> can<00:02:56.310> see<00:02:56.700> that<00:02:56.819> all<00:02:57.030> those<00:02:57.239> lines

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
that you can see that all those lines

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.599 
that you can see that all those lines
are<00:02:57.750> laying<00:02:57.870> side<00:02:58.200> by<00:02:58.230> side<00:02:58.680> there's<00:02:59.400> no

00:02:59.599 --> 00:02:59.609 
are laying side by side there's no

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:01.190 
are laying side by side there's no
little<00:02:59.849> lumps<00:03:00.239> and<00:03:00.359> the<00:03:00.480> knot<00:03:00.689> with<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:00.959> lines

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
little lumps and the knot with the lines

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.429 
little lumps and the knot with the lines
of<00:03:01.379> crossed<00:03:01.650> over<00:03:02.120> it's<00:03:03.120> just<00:03:03.299> all<00:03:03.540> line<00:03:03.930> long

00:03:04.429 --> 00:03:04.439 
of crossed over it's just all line long

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:07.819 
of crossed over it's just all line long
and<00:03:04.680> lean<00:03:04.859> perfect
