 more or less 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.960
 currently we all have a slight idea of ​​what the chest is and they were 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.600
 we have the idea of 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.930
 people in the parks of china doing the very slow exercises 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.490

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.410
 the history of the roof have about the benefits of its practice 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.110
 the bump 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.639
 arise in a village called the defense village had 

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:12.589
 in ancient china 

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:14.009
 originally 

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:15.609
 we have been told 

00:02:15.609 --> 00:02:17.549
 that existed 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:19.709
 dawn of Chinese civilization 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.229
 funny you a mythical Taoist 

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:24.839
 teacher called chanza 11 

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:27.679
 so santeño had been military and in certain 

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:31.399
 time of his life he decided to retire to the mountains to study Taoism 

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:33.579
 in that retreat 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:36.999
 in the mountains they tell p observed 

00:02:36.999 --> 00:02:39.989
 the fight between a crane and a snake 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.439
 drawing conclusions about the different combat strategies between 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:45.419
 the glory and the serpent 

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:48.419
 little by little developed the art of the chi chuan country 

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:51.019
 another legend 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:54.019
 he also tells us that the same shanshan feng 

00:02:54.719 --> 00:02:58.959
 One night he dreamed of the black emperor and the emperor revealed the art of 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.379
 country signed 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:02.769
 the legend says that the next day 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:05.769
 chan santa and he faced 100 bandits and defeated them all 

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:10.009
 the story of this character is lost in the night of time 

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:12.429
 but it's a beautiful story 

00:03:12.429 --> 00:03:16.059
 the next reference we have about the percent existence of tai 

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.709
 chi chuan 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.529
 the village of chen chaco takes us 

00:03:19.529 --> 00:03:22.529
 there are different schools different styles of tahíche 

00:03:22.529 --> 00:03:23.680
 the first style 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.719
 it's the chen style 

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:29.869
 that's why we talk about the village of chincha fuego is currently a village because 

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:33.039
 known very popular especially because all the Beijing practitioners when 

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:35.039
 the world usually go to visit him 

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:37.259
 today it is a tourist center par excellence 

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:40.639
 still retains its essence its magic 

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:43.979
 the first reference we have about the first 

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:46.249
 to the center of the family do 

00:03:46.249 --> 00:03:49.009
 this one gentleman called chen bush 

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:52.039
 ponce both opens the lineage of the family 

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:55.059
 however much later we arrived at cheng guangcheng 

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:57.649
 who was really 

00:03:57.649 --> 00:03:58.669
 and among others 

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:01.749
 the chanel style tai chi chuan 

00:04:01.749 --> 00:04:05.639
 there is a lot of difficulty to adjudicate out of mind 

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:07.649
 the origin of the country and juan 

00:04:07.649 --> 00:04:11.229
 therefore we can finally conclude that the petiso have 

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:12.479
 emerged 

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:13.959
 along d 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.199
 many many many years 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:17.400
 based 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.670
 knowledge or practice experience of various teachers 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.599
 pepo that were not specifying all these practices 

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:27.599
 and that knowledge in what is currently the art of tai chi chuan 

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:32.199
 What we have very clear is that the chen style was the first style that 

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:34.069
 it came as such 

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:38.249
 and from the zen style later a multitude of styles arose 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:43.919
 for example one of the masters who was trained in the chen style 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.220
 he ended up separating himself from the chen family and creating the plain style 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.539
 the style yanes the style practically 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:53.759
 most popular and best known 

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:55.080
 in the West 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.639
 It is even the style recognized by the government of Beijing with the form no longer 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:02.639
 24 official peking at the time 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.610
 so 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.419
 from there there are also other super stylos like buñuel style 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:10.969
 style soul style jao 

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:14.439
 were the first style of checks began to extend each one has its 

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:16.750
 different characteristics 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.750
 although they all share the same principles 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:27.330
 currently in our school we follow the two main lines on the one hand 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:33.039
 We teach the Yankee style with our friend and companion and teacher who in 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:35.849
 and on the other hand 

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:37.759
 we teach chen style 

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:41.539
 in the line of the master john fithian even when in pedro valencia with whom 

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:43.210
 i studied i learned 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.830
 later on the line with record of the great teacher pedro valencia 

00:05:47.499 --> 00:05:50.499
 the Chinese style derived from style which is called chen jung-hwan 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:55.039
 one of the most beautiful effective styles we can currently find 

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:03.240
 what is tai chi chuan 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.550
 fix you I tell you taefik juan and yet 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:09.230
 the majority does it because we speak only of tahíche does not exhaust and chic 

00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:12.659
 if we say only tahiti 

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:13.830
 somehow 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:16.830
 we are referring to a Taoist concept 

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:22.159
 that means big energy big sizes and that energy suanes june 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:26.389
 2 when we study and observe the complete lamp of tai chi chuan 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.790
 we discovered that we came to the conclusion that eta and typhoons an art 

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:33.699
 martial 

00:06:33.699 --> 00:06:36.309
 fell big chi energy swamp june 

00:06:36.309 --> 00:06:38.009
 a lot of energy in the fist 

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:42.080
 the interpretation the place to different translations but generally you 

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:42.969
 know how 

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:45.969
 Ultimate style boxing 

00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:47.779
 Thus 

00:06:47.779 --> 00:06:51.129
 we see that one of those who were from delta and chi chuan fundamentals is that 

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:53.319
 it emerged as a martial art 

00:06:53.319 --> 00:06:56.319
 an internal martial art 

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.020
 there are great legends 

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:03.669
 of formidable fighters using the chest made before have been invincible 

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:07.249
 as grand master eight draws 

00:07:07.249 --> 00:07:10.379
 that went to the psuv ex teacher of the teacher juan fiction 

00:07:11.349 --> 00:07:14.789
 teacher of the school teacher in which I learned pedro valentine 

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:19.319
 Thus 

00:07:19.319 --> 00:07:21.770
 the practice of tai chi chuan 

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:25.110
 one of its fundamental pillars that forms a complete 

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:25.889
 system 

00:07:25.889 --> 00:07:28.189
 d personal defense is a complete
