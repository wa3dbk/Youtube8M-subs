and be careful not to drop this because

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.000 
and be careful not to drop this because
I<00:02:12.160> dropped<00:02:12.430> mine<00:02:12.610> and<00:02:12.760> I<00:02:12.790> got<00:02:12.970> a<00:02:13.000> crack<00:02:13.390> in<00:02:13.420> it

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
I dropped mine and I got a crack in it

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.330 
I dropped mine and I got a crack in it
and<00:02:15.010> I<00:02:15.060> had<00:02:16.060> to<00:02:16.150> buy<00:02:16.270> a<00:02:16.300> new<00:02:16.330> one<00:02:16.950> because<00:02:17.950> it

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
and I had to buy a new one because it

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.060 
and I had to buy a new one because it
messed<00:02:18.550> up<00:02:18.700> the<00:02:19.140> all<00:02:20.140> these<00:02:20.560> I<00:02:20.590> don't<00:02:20.920> know<00:02:21.010> if

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
messed up the all these I don't know if

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.530 
messed up the all these I don't know if
you<00:02:21.160> can<00:02:21.220> see<00:02:21.490> all<00:02:21.520> that<00:02:21.820> but<00:02:22.030> those<00:02:22.300> little

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
you can see all that but those little

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.070 
you can see all that but those little
dots<00:02:23.100> actually<00:02:24.100> the<00:02:24.250> wheels<00:02:24.490> that<00:02:25.360> sense<00:02:25.810> this

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
dots actually the wheels that sense this

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.720 
dots actually the wheels that sense this
move<00:02:26.380> in<00:02:26.530> so<00:02:26.710> it<00:02:26.830> kind<00:02:27.040> of<00:02:27.130> knows<00:02:27.310> which<00:02:27.520> way<00:02:27.670> to

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
move in so it kind of knows which way to

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.640 
move in so it kind of knows which way to
go<00:02:27.820> and<00:02:28.150> there<00:02:28.690> was<00:02:28.810> a<00:02:28.840> crack<00:02:29.140> in<00:02:29.170> there<00:02:29.440> so<00:02:29.590> I
