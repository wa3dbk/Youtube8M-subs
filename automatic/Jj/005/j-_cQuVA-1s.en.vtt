00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:53.550 
in there and after that I'm going to

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.970 
in there and after that I'm going to
just<00:01:53.820> take<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.270> archstone<00:01:54.840> running<00:01:55.170> brush<00:01:55.350> look

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:55.980 
just take a archstone running brush look

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.400 
just take a archstone running brush look
at<00:01:56.160> this<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:56.730> I'm<00:01:57.180> just<00:01:57.360> going<00:01:57.510> to<00:01:57.660> blend<00:01:58.200> that

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:58.410 
at this and I'm just going to blend that

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:03.170 
at this and I'm just going to blend that
in<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:59.430> outer<00:02:00.410> third<00:02:01.410> of<00:02:01.710> my<00:02:02.130> crease<00:02:02.520> not

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
in the outer third of my crease not

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.910

dragging into the inner corner or

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.400 
dragging into the inner corner or
quarter<00:02:05.640> because<00:02:05.850> if<00:02:06.210> we<00:02:06.390> do<00:02:06.570> that<00:02:06.600> it<00:02:07.260> will

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.410 
quarter because if we do that it will

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.200 
quarter because if we do that it will
close<00:02:07.710> in<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.010> eye<00:02:08.040> and<00:02:08.490> that<00:02:08.670> doesn't<00:02:09.119> look

maybelline's<00:04:00.520> colossal<00:04:01.000> ash<00:04:01.150> the<00:04:01.630> reason<00:04:01.870> I

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
maybelline's colossal ash the reason I

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.480 
maybelline's colossal ash the reason I
commanded<00:04:02.350> to<00:04:02.500> is<00:04:02.710> because<00:04:03.190> it<00:04:03.550> um<00:04:03.930> helps<00:04:04.930> to

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:05.490 
commanded to is because it um helps to

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:07.620 
commanded to is because it um helps to
volumize<00:04:06.490> a<00:04:06.820> little<00:04:07.030> bit<00:04:07.120> and<00:04:07.270> like<00:04:07.450> I've<00:04:07.600> said

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
volumize a little bit and like I've said

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.420 
volumize a little bit and like I've said
before<00:04:07.810> I<00:04:08.080> really<00:04:08.500> really<00:04:08.680> like<00:04:08.890> that<00:04:09.070> Club

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
before I really really like that Club

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.450 
before I really really like that Club
the<00:04:09.580> lash<00:04:09.760> effect<00:04:10.000> and<00:04:10.500> like<00:04:11.500> the<00:04:11.650> fall<00:04:11.860> /<00:04:12.040> and

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:12.460 
the lash effect and like the fall / and

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:13.890 
the lash effect and like the fall / and
I<00:04:12.520> really<00:04:12.790> don't<00:04:12.940> like<00:04:13.000> falsies<00:04:13.540> that<00:04:13.750> much

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
I really don't like falsies that much

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
I really don't like falsies that much
because<00:04:14.170> I<00:04:14.350> don't<00:04:14.500> think<00:04:14.650> that<00:04:14.800> it<00:04:14.890> really

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
because I don't think that it really

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.320 
because I don't think that it really
makes<00:04:15.280> you<00:04:15.400> look<00:04:15.550> like<00:04:15.700> you<00:04:15.760> up<00:04:15.910> false<00:04:16.090> lashes

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:16.330 
makes you look like you up false lashes

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:18.780 
makes you look like you up false lashes

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
up these two will make my eyelashes a

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.140 
up these two will make my eyelashes a
lot<00:04:22.120> thicker<00:04:22.360> so<00:04:23.290> um<00:04:23.680> yeah<00:04:24.610> I'm<00:04:24.790> just<00:04:24.910> going<00:04:25.090> to
