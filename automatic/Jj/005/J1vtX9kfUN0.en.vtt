00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.320
 hello friends you are welcome a 

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:07.030
 again more at the beginning he speaks 

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:10.780
 in this video we present the 

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:12.490
 complete review of the lg people of tibú 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.620
 thank you very much not for your 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.870
 collaboration but that you like the video 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.760
 as always if they like we give a like 

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:21.670
 If you have not done so, subscribe to 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:24.000
 channel let's start this review now 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.000
 same 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.529
 now that we have the thymus axis first 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.440
 I do not want to talk about design 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.809
 especially the back that the 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.879
 Function buttons of the model have 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:42.129
 back to raise and lower the volume and the 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:44.050
 Start button is placed on the 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:46.659
 back of the phone we do not have 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.390
 physical gifts on the sides the axis says 

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:51.579
 which is more comfortable is more natural to place 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.979
 the index finger through that one way 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:56.050
 normal in which your phone operation was 

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:57.909
 that I like really works 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.159
 it makes a lot of sense to have the buttons on 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:02.230
 Straight back function that is natural 

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:02.949
 drive to this side when you have to paste 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.600
 ear 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:06.850
 others are always driving you have the 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.619
 today in different back you do more 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.570
 comfortable because it's the beginning of the phone 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:13.320
 and also lower and raise the volume 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.320
 when he needs 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.920
 more more more to me it's more natural and of 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:20.320
 truth that makes sense if I tell them 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.820
 you have to get used a little bit 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.860
 we are used to the buttons of 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.630
 Start of volume next to the delay 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.009
 a day or two to get used to the 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.530
 engines so far back but I really do 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:31.750
 like and it makes a lot of sense besides the 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.000
 phone design is super finite if you 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.280
 they ask as now to use it 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.510
 it's really quite fine since it 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.670
 it feels good when it comes to handling it 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.729
 have it in your hand the screen is a 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.320
 5.2 inch screen as you can see 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.890
 resolutions 1920 x 1080 be a 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:50.340
 1080p high definition screen and 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.510
 It is also a super amoled screen 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.710
 also the corner battles is who 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.260
 that makes you feel that the screen 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.150
 being a battle of 5.2 be more 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.190
 little girls what what really 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.660
 You can reach all the points of the 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.090
 screen with a finger can only handle 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.979
 the phone the operating system with a 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.470
 only hand that to put together the forms of 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:11.200
 size the truth that works and it 's fine 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:14.470
 useful processor is a processor 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:17.320
 four cores 2.26 gamers wonder 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.420
 I want country of rural and it comes with 32 of 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.790
 them for this internal memory I tell them 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.170
 one of the best processors but the 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.140
 best processor I've seen in a 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.090
 phone is in the lg of very good to see 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.610
 that this phone is a super band 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.560
 super super fast to change page 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.440
 that I'm doing it fast and not 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.700

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.850
 facebook like very fast 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.280
 let's open another few applications 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.860
 so they have a chance to see the 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.580
 place tour 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:52.710
 to watch video is a pleasure to navigate 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.090
 the internet to do with guys in 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.670
 this video that this sale phone that 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.640
 It is a pleasure to use this processor 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.500
 a rod and I tell them I repeat if it is not 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.290
 the best one is one of the best here 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.210
 we have the page of we are going to 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.460
 handle a little dull puncture the 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:11.760
 screen so they can also be seen 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:13.590
 super fast is a bar that has a 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.350
 incredible performance does not have any 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.990
 kind of backwardness and that I love this 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.730
 processor at the same time the screen 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.260
 I also think it 's in one of the 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.450
 best screens I've seen in a 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.860
 mobile phone highlights the sharpness of the 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.830
 screen is excellent and one has been 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.510
 better web pages can see that no 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.020
 have any kind of pixel action to the 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.510
 hour of 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:35.800
 vélez texts has cameras 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.750
 Instantly to change 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.520
 position on the sales screen that 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.190
 colors look super its allowed 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.020

 offers up to 17 hours of continuous use in 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.440
 actually this footage is not 17 hours 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.050
 are about 12 to 14 the capacity that 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.850
 He gave me but for me he owes me 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.710
 8 to 10 hours is perfect to give me a 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.150
 day of use without having to recharge the 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:05.650
 phone 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.780
 this phone is perfect for me 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:11.470

00:05:02.339 --> 00:05:06.930

 front camera at the same time but that 

00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:20.550
 I'll leave an example now since 

00:05:18.809 --> 00:05:23.279
 I have them an example of the camera 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.990
 LG 2 video also using the 

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:27.749
 integrated microphone so they have a 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:29.459
 idea of how it works and how this sounds 

00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:31.199
 microphone are also used both 

00:05:29.459 --> 00:05:33.149
 cameras the rear camera and the camera 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:34.830
 front to record your videos to the 

00:05:33.149 --> 00:05:37.409
 same time as you can see in the star 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:39.270
 here I am by the front camera its 

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:41.339
 work we are recording two videos to the 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:43.910
 the same time that it is a super useful function 

00:05:41.339 --> 00:05:47.780
 and I really love it 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:49.970
 to conclude this review of LG 2 of you 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:51.620
 new to operate the thymus network that is 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:54.290
 an excellent network is a pretty network 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:58.340
 fast is operating in the 4g lte network of 

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:59.900
 scam and also the edge hsp network to which 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.890
 a pretty fast network and it works 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.020
 rather he did not have any kind of 

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:04.400
 problem with the thymus network has with 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.020
 all the stimulus applications here 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.180
 down the applications that I estimate that 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.980
 offers but they really are looking 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.180

 it's a samsung or for an iphone this is 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:19.550
 a good alternative truth lg 2 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:22.070
 that if they had a phone list 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:24.110
 favorite is that he was in the first 

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:25.700
 a second place at the moment since it is 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:27.920

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:34.940
 the best phones available in the 

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:37.700
