00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:03.860 

here's<00:00:02.220> another<00:00:02.370> one<00:00:02.730> of<00:00:02.850> my<00:00:02.970> little<00:00:03.270> projects

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
here's another one of my little projects

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.780 
here's another one of my little projects
that<00:00:04.020> I<00:00:04.049> recently<00:00:04.319> finished<00:00:04.920> it's<00:00:05.640> a

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
that I recently finished it's a

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.579 
that I recently finished it's a
telephone<00:00:06.089> intercom<00:00:06.810> system

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
telephone intercom system

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.459 
telephone intercom system
I<00:00:07.620> have<00:00:08.309> several<00:00:08.519> telephones<00:00:09.150> here<00:00:09.510> the<00:00:10.200> board

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
I have several telephones here the board

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.080 
I have several telephones here the board
that<00:00:10.679> I<00:00:10.710> designed<00:00:11.160> will<00:00:11.340> accommodate<00:00:11.880> up<00:00:12.030> to

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
that I designed will accommodate up to

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.350 
that I designed will accommodate up to
eight<00:00:12.450> different<00:00:13.170> phones<00:00:13.469> and<00:00:14.179> most<00:00:15.179> of

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
eight different phones and most of

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.150 
eight different phones and most of
what's<00:00:15.540> on<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.839> circuit<00:00:16.230> here<00:00:16.560> is<00:00:16.590> for

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
what's on the circuit here is for

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.760 
what's on the circuit here is for
signaling<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:17.970> other<00:00:18.060> phones<00:00:18.420> it's<00:00:19.080> pretty

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
signaling the other phones it's pretty

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.920 
signaling the other phones it's pretty
easy<00:00:19.980> to<00:00:20.250> wire<00:00:20.430> several<00:00:20.970> phones<00:00:21.210> together<00:00:21.660> so

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
easy to wire several phones together so

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.840 
easy to wire several phones together so
that<00:00:22.050> you<00:00:22.140> can<00:00:22.350> talk<00:00:22.560> between<00:00:22.800> them<00:00:23.310> but<00:00:23.789> the

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
that you can talk between them but the

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.439 
that you can talk between them but the
signaling<00:00:24.449> is<00:00:24.600> usually<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.109> critical<00:00:25.590> part

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:26.449 
signaling is usually the critical part

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:29.179 
signaling is usually the critical part
what<00:00:27.449> I've<00:00:27.570> got<00:00:27.750> is<00:00:28.019> a<00:00:28.080> circuit<00:00:28.650> on<00:00:28.769> here<00:00:29.010> that

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
what I've got is a circuit on here that

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.070 
what I've got is a circuit on here that
decodes<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.820> touch<00:00:30.060> tone<00:00:30.390> from<00:00:30.960> the

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
decodes the touch tone from the

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.370 
decodes the touch tone from the
telephones<00:00:31.529> when<00:00:31.830> you<00:00:31.920> push<00:00:32.130> a<00:00:32.160> button<00:00:32.279> it

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:33.380 
telephones when you push a button it

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.660 
telephones when you push a button it
signals<00:00:34.380> one<00:00:34.559> of<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.800> other<00:00:34.920> stations<00:00:35.489> in

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
signals one of the other stations in

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.549 
signals one of the other stations in
this<00:00:35.790> case<00:00:36.000> I'm<00:00:36.149> pushing<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.600> two<00:00:36.809> so<00:00:37.110> station

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
this case I'm pushing the two so station

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.040 
this case I'm pushing the two so station
number<00:00:37.800> two<00:00:37.829> it's<00:00:38.700> making<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.180> tone<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.690> also

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
number two it's making a tone and also

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.900 
number two it's making a tone and also
added<00:00:40.320> LEDs<00:00:40.829> so<00:00:41.100> that<00:00:41.219> you<00:00:41.340> could<00:00:41.520> see<00:00:41.730> that

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
added LEDs so that you could see that

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.420 
added LEDs so that you could see that
the<00:00:42.059> station<00:00:42.480> was<00:00:43.020> being<00:00:43.350> signaled<00:00:43.649> as

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
the station was being signaled as

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.459 
the station was being signaled as
opposed<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:45.059> say<00:00:45.270> another<00:00:45.539> station<00:00:45.899> this<00:00:46.260> one

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
opposed to say another station this one

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.260 
opposed to say another station this one
here<00:00:46.739> which<00:00:46.950> would<00:00:47.100> be<00:00:47.160> station<00:00:47.700> seven<00:00:48.090> I

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
here which would be station seven I

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.260 
here which would be station seven I
could<00:00:49.079> signal<00:00:49.440> Allen<00:00:49.770> there's<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.700> bee<00:00:50.850> station

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
could signal Allen there's a bee station

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.180 
could signal Allen there's a bee station
eight<00:00:51.500> except<00:00:52.500> they<00:00:52.649> didn't<00:00:52.860> have<00:00:52.920> enough

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
eight except they didn't have enough

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.850 
eight except they didn't have enough
phones<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:53.670> go<00:00:53.789> around<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.440> just<00:00:55.469> pick<00:00:55.770> up

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
phones to go around and you just pick up

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:56.990 
phones to go around and you just pick up
the<00:00:55.980> phone<00:00:56.160> you<00:00:56.190> push<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.610> button<00:00:56.850> for<00:00:56.940> the

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
the phone you push the button for the

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.930 
the phone you push the button for the
station<00:00:57.390> want<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.600> talk<00:00:57.719> to

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
station want to talk to

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.120 
station want to talk to
sound<00:00:59.810> the<00:00:59.960> tone<00:01:00.170> they<00:01:00.590> pick<00:01:00.770> up<00:01:00.920> the<00:01:01.100> phone

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:01.130 
sound the tone they pick up the phone

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.229 
sound the tone they pick up the phone
you<00:01:01.550> talk<00:01:02.090> pretty<00:01:02.960> simple<00:01:03.610> runs<00:01:04.610> on<00:01:04.729> a<00:01:04.760> 12<00:01:05.059> volt

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
you talk pretty simple runs on a 12 volt

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.800 
you talk pretty simple runs on a 12 volt
battery<00:01:05.979> you<00:01:06.979> could<00:01:07.100> probably<00:01:07.310> have<00:01:07.820> a<00:01:08.360> couple

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
battery you could probably have a couple

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.320 
battery you could probably have a couple
of<00:01:08.870> miles<00:01:09.110> of<00:01:09.440> line<00:01:09.740> between<00:01:10.100> the<00:01:10.729> unit<00:01:11.090> and

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
of miles of line between the unit and

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.300 
of miles of line between the unit and
the<00:01:11.900> station<00:01:12.380> so<00:01:12.590> you<00:01:12.620> could<00:01:12.830> have<00:01:12.979> it<00:01:13.100> at<00:01:13.190> the

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
the station so you could have it at the

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:14.800 
the station so you could have it at the
neighbor's<00:01:13.610> house<00:01:13.820> the<00:01:14.150> bar<00:01:14.330> in<00:01:14.479> the<00:01:14.600> garage

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
neighbor's house the bar in the garage

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.710 
neighbor's house the bar in the garage
the<00:01:15.170> workshop<00:01:15.680> make<00:01:16.400> use<00:01:16.580> of<00:01:16.670> that<00:01:16.940> telephone

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
the workshop make use of that telephone

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.450 
the workshop make use of that telephone
wiring<00:01:18.110> that's<00:01:18.410> in<00:01:18.650> your<00:01:18.800> house<00:01:18.950> a<00:01:18.979> lot<00:01:19.310> of

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
wiring that's in your house a lot of

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.130 
wiring that's in your house a lot of
people<00:01:19.670> don't<00:01:19.790> have<00:01:20.000> phones<00:01:20.240> anymore<00:01:20.840> but<00:01:21.050> you

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
people don't have phones anymore but you

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.050 
people don't have phones anymore but you
still<00:01:21.350> have<00:01:21.500> the<00:01:21.619> wiring<00:01:21.860> if<00:01:22.700> you<00:01:22.850> build

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
still have the wiring if you build

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.520 
still have the wiring if you build
something<00:01:23.119> like<00:01:23.479> this<00:01:23.810> you<00:01:24.080> get<00:01:24.200> have<00:01:24.320> phones

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
something like this you get have phones

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.170 
something like this you get have phones
in<00:01:24.710> each<00:01:24.890> room<00:01:25.190> and<00:01:25.400> just<00:01:25.520> use<00:01:25.729> it<00:01:25.759> as<00:01:26.030> an

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
in each room and just use it as an

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.540 
in each room and just use it as an
intercom<00:01:26.600> to<00:01:26.780> call<00:01:26.960> somebody<00:01:27.440> to<00:01:27.619> come<00:01:28.520> to

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.870 
dinner or whatever it is the battery
draw<00:01:31.880> is<00:01:32.320> about<00:01:33.320> 50<00:01:33.770> milliamps<00:01:34.100> when<00:01:34.550> the

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
draw is about 50 milliamps when the

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.670 
draw is about 50 milliamps when the
systems<00:01:35.270> in<00:01:35.450> use<00:01:35.630> while<00:01:35.960> you're<00:01:36.140> on<00:01:36.320> the<00:01:36.470> phone

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
systems in use while you're on the phone

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.920 
systems in use while you're on the phone
and<00:01:36.920> talking<00:01:37.369> when<00:01:37.820> it's<00:01:38.000> hung<00:01:38.240> up<00:01:38.450> it's<00:01:38.780> about

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
and talking when it's hung up it's about

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.880 
and talking when it's hung up it's about
50<00:01:39.560> micro<00:01:40.190> amps<00:01:40.640> essentially<00:01:41.450> nothing<00:01:41.890> the

50 micro amps essentially nothing the
circuit<00:01:43.250> board<00:01:43.460> I've<00:01:43.670> got<00:01:43.820> a<00:01:44.030> relay<00:01:44.390> for<00:01:44.420> each

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
circuit board I've got a relay for each

circuit board I've got a relay for each
of<00:01:44.869> the<00:01:44.960> outputs<00:01:45.380> and<00:01:45.560> all<00:01:45.680> I'm<00:01:45.800> doing<00:01:46.070> is

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
of the outputs and all I'm doing is

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.889 
of the outputs and all I'm doing is
reversing<00:01:46.700> the<00:01:46.820> polarity<00:01:46.970> of<00:01:47.330> the<00:01:47.509> line<00:01:47.660> going

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
reversing the polarity of the line going

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:50.050 
reversing the polarity of the line going
out<00:01:48.110> to<00:01:48.289> the<00:01:48.410> station<00:01:48.860> to<00:01:49.009> signal<00:01:49.430> it<00:01:49.550> I'm

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
out to the station to signal it I'm

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.430 
out to the station to signal it I'm
using<00:01:50.300> an<00:01:50.509> 88<00:01:51.020> 70<00:01:52.479> DTMF<00:01:53.479> or<00:01:53.899> touch-tone

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
using an 88 70 DTMF or touch-tone

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.180 
using an 88 70 DTMF or touch-tone
decoder<00:01:54.830> chip<00:01:54.920> and<00:01:55.369> a<00:01:55.729> 74<00:01:56.330> HC<00:01:56.860> 237<00:01:57.860> which<00:01:58.009> is<00:01:58.160> a

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
decoder chip and a 74 HC 237 which is a

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.600 
decoder chip and a 74 HC 237 which is a
simple<00:01:58.610> logic<00:01:59.000> gated<00:01:59.390> so<00:01:59.630> 3<00:01:59.960> to<00:02:00.080> 8<00:02:00.259> decoder

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
simple logic gated so 3 to 8 decoder

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.430 
simple logic gated so 3 to 8 decoder
because<00:02:01.610> the<00:02:01.850> output<00:02:02.149> of<00:02:02.180> this<00:02:02.390> is<00:02:02.450> binary<00:02:02.810> and

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
because the output of this is binary and

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.800 
because the output of this is binary and
I<00:02:03.500> want<00:02:03.709> individual<00:02:04.369> outputs<00:02:04.910> and<00:02:05.179> I<00:02:05.660> added

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
I want individual outputs and I added

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.480 
I want individual outputs and I added
some<00:02:05.959> LEDs<00:02:06.440> onto<00:02:06.709> the<00:02:06.770> board<00:02:06.979> so<00:02:07.130> you<00:02:07.190> can<00:02:07.340> see

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
some LEDs onto the board so you can see

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:15.100 
some LEDs onto the board so you can see
as<00:02:07.610> I<00:02:07.759> go<00:02:07.940> through<00:02:07.970> the<00:02:08.330> station's<00:02:13.930> so<00:02:14.930> I<00:02:14.959> can

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
as I go through the station's so I can

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.260 
as I go through the station's so I can
signal<00:02:15.380> eight<00:02:15.950> different<00:02:16.490> stations<00:02:16.970> just

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
signal eight different stations just

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.449 
signal eight different stations just
dialing<00:02:17.750> on<00:02:17.870> the<00:02:18.020> touch-tone<00:02:18.440> pad<00:02:18.709> number

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
dialing on the touch-tone pad number

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:22.330 
dialing on the touch-tone pad number
seven<00:02:20.140> chattered<00:02:21.140> because<00:02:21.530> this<00:02:21.770> phone<00:02:22.010> is

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
seven chattered because this phone is

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.370 
seven chattered because this phone is
hooked<00:02:22.520> to<00:02:22.640> port<00:02:22.910> number<00:02:23.240> seven<00:02:23.720> and<00:02:24.230> when<00:02:24.349> I

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
hooked to port number seven and when I

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.620 
hooked to port number seven and when I
push<00:02:24.650> the<00:02:24.920> button<00:02:24.950> the<00:02:25.849> thing<00:02:26.060> decodes<00:02:26.420> the

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
push the button the thing decodes the

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.949 
push the button the thing decodes the
tone<00:02:26.840> it<00:02:27.110> reverses<00:02:27.650> the<00:02:27.680> priority<00:02:28.810> going<00:02:29.810> to

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
tone it reverses the priority going to

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.080 
tone it reverses the priority going to
the<00:02:30.080> station<00:02:30.620> and<00:02:30.800> also<00:02:31.220> disconnects<00:02:31.940> it<00:02:32.060> from

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
the station and also disconnects it from

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.940 
the station and also disconnects it from
the<00:02:32.360> talk<00:02:32.569> bus<00:02:32.840> and<00:02:33.080> that's<00:02:33.140> how<00:02:33.319> it<00:02:33.470> signals

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
the talk bus and that's how it signals

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.070 
the talk bus and that's how it signals
and<00:02:34.250> makes<00:02:34.580> the<00:02:34.790> sounder<00:02:35.180> operate<00:02:35.630> and<00:02:35.870> lights

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
and makes the sounder operate and lights

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.140 
and makes the sounder operate and lights
the<00:02:36.200> LED<00:02:36.290> but<00:02:37.220> it's<00:02:37.340> no<00:02:37.459> longer<00:02:37.610> on<00:02:37.819> the<00:02:37.940> talk

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
the LED but it's no longer on the talk

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.120 
the LED but it's no longer on the talk
circuit<00:02:38.599> so<00:02:38.720> it<00:02:38.840> releases<00:02:39.200> but<00:02:39.739> then<00:02:39.920> when<00:02:40.040> it

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
circuit so it releases but then when it

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.949 
circuit so it releases but then when it
goes<00:02:40.250> back<00:02:40.430> on<00:02:40.580> the<00:02:40.640> talk<00:02:40.880> circuit<00:02:41.330> it<00:02:41.450> turns

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
goes back on the talk circuit it turns

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:44.350 
goes back on the talk circuit it turns
on<00:02:42.110> again<00:02:42.410> so<00:02:42.860> if<00:02:43.130> you<00:02:43.220> try<00:02:43.400> to<00:02:43.459> call<00:02:43.640> yourself

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
on again so if you try to call yourself

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.080 
on again so if you try to call yourself
it'll<00:02:45.200> chat<00:02:45.470> on<00:02:45.830> any<00:02:46.280> of<00:02:46.430> the<00:02:46.489> phones<00:02:46.700> if<00:02:46.940> I'm

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
it'll chat on any of the phones if I'm

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.080 
it'll chat on any of the phones if I'm
on<00:02:47.270> this<00:02:47.480> one<00:02:47.690> they<00:02:47.870> call<00:02:48.080> one<00:02:48.790> it'll<00:02:49.790> chatter

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
on this one they call one it'll chatter

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.520 
on this one they call one it'll chatter
but<00:02:50.540> normally<00:02:50.900> you<00:02:50.959> wouldn't<00:02:51.110> do<00:02:51.230> that<00:02:51.260> you'd

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
but normally you wouldn't do that you'd

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.800 
but normally you wouldn't do that you'd
be<00:02:51.620> calling<00:02:51.830> Station<00:02:52.400> two<00:02:52.610> or<00:02:52.970> station<00:02:53.390> seven

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
be calling Station two or station seven

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.250 
be calling Station two or station seven
or<00:02:54.410> whatever<00:02:54.709> and<00:02:55.099> then<00:02:56.000> go<00:02:56.390> a<00:02:56.420> step<00:02:56.720> further

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
or whatever and then go a step further

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.729 
or whatever and then go a step further
I<00:02:57.440> took<00:02:58.190> a<00:02:58.720> cheap<00:02:59.720> cordless<00:03:00.200> phone<00:03:00.410> that<00:03:00.650> I

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
I took a cheap cordless phone that I

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:03.220 
I took a cheap cordless phone that I
picked<00:03:00.980> up<00:03:01.129> and<00:03:01.400> I<00:03:02.209> might<00:03:02.420> have<00:03:02.569> find<00:03:02.750> it<00:03:02.930> most

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
picked up and I might have find it most

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.229 
picked up and I might have find it most
of<00:03:03.379> these<00:03:03.440> phones<00:03:03.709> have<00:03:03.950> the<00:03:04.160> handset<00:03:04.670> find

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
of these phones have the handset find

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:07.850 
of these phones have the handset find
button<00:03:05.780> or<00:03:06.290> the<00:03:06.500> page<00:03:06.739> button<00:03:07.280> depending<00:03:07.550> what

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
button or the page button depending what

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.270 
button or the page button depending what
they<00:03:07.950> called<00:03:08.190> it<00:03:08.400> and<00:03:08.610> I<00:03:09.330> wired<00:03:09.770> this<00:03:10.770> up<00:03:11.040> with

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
they called it and I wired this up with

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.400 
they called it and I wired this up with
a<00:03:11.310> relay<00:03:11.760> inside<00:03:12.210> the<00:03:12.390> handset<00:03:12.870> so<00:03:13.110> that<00:03:13.260> when

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
a relay inside the handset so that when

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.200 
a relay inside the handset so that when
the<00:03:13.500> reverse<00:03:13.800> polarity<00:03:14.100> comes<00:03:14.430> across<00:03:14.880> the

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.210 
the reverse polarity comes across the

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:18.140 
the reverse polarity comes across the
line<00:03:15.240> it<00:03:16.080> triggers<00:03:16.590> this<00:03:17.070> button<00:03:17.520> so<00:03:17.910> that<00:03:17.940> I

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
line it triggers this button so that I

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.070 
line it triggers this button so that I
can<00:03:18.300> pick<00:03:18.420> up<00:03:18.570> the<00:03:18.660> phone<00:03:18.980> at<00:03:19.980> four<00:03:20.550> and<00:03:21.330> now

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
can pick up the phone at four and now

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.900 
can pick up the phone at four and now
this<00:03:22.260> thing<00:03:22.320> beats<00:03:22.800> so<00:03:23.550> I<00:03:23.580> would<00:03:23.820> know

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
this thing beats so I would know

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.590 
this thing beats so I would know
somebody<00:03:24.150> was<00:03:24.420> calling<00:03:24.600> me<00:03:24.900> I<00:03:25.610> just<00:03:26.610> hit<00:03:27.330> talk

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
somebody was calling me I just hit talk

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.760 
somebody was calling me I just hit talk
and<00:03:27.980> answer<00:03:28.980> it<00:03:29.040> and<00:03:29.250> now<00:03:29.400> I'm<00:03:29.520> talking<00:03:30.770> so

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
and answer it and now I'm talking so

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.510 
and answer it and now I'm talking so
that's<00:03:32.760> my<00:03:32.910> little<00:03:33.060> project
