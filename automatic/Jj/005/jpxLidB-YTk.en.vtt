00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.960 

because<00:02:40.020> there's<00:02:40.200> a<00:02:40.290> long<00:02:40.470> cool<00:02:40.710> down<00:02:40.980> before

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
because there's a long cool down before

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.780 
because there's a long cool down before
you<00:02:42.300> can<00:02:42.450> use<00:02:42.480> the<00:02:42.780> Farseer<00:02:43.320> walls<00:02:43.530> again<00:02:43.890> so

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
you can use the Farseer walls again so

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.420 
you can use the Farseer walls again so
you<00:02:44.850> need<00:02:45.030> to<00:02:45.150> bear<00:02:45.330> that<00:02:45.480> in<00:02:45.630> mind<00:02:49.220> go<00:02:50.220> for<00:02:50.400> the
