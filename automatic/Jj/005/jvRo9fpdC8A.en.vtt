 good afternoon my name is dmitry not 

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:06.410
 technical specialist corporation 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:07.910
 technonicol 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.339
 technical specialist in flex 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.739
 shinglas tiles today i'm in 

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:16.279
 the city of Saratov cottage settlement thief 

00:00:12.739 --> 00:00:17.480
 said residents whose roofing 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:20.060
 their hotels 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:23.670
 conversation vibrations chosen shingles 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:26.970
 shinglas production company technique 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.140
 so why are the residents of this cottage 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.410
 village chosen 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.480
 shinglas shingles are now very 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.570
 many people pay much attention 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:41.309
 the choice of the roof as the roof is already 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:43.340
 the fifth facade of the building if a person 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.230
 begins such a large-scale construction 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:49.320
 he has so many choices 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.600
 between different materials but in 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.660
 basically everyone stops either on 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.979
 shinglas shingles either on 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.199
 metal tile now let's 

00:00:55.979 --> 00:01:00.780
 consider what are the advantages of 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.430
 shinglas tile in front of metal 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.820
 in front of metal in front of metal 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.820
 profile 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:11.530
 shinglas shingles warranty 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.930
 is 50 years old all answer you 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.690
 think only from this figure 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:19.960
 metal tile warranty 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:22.660
 which is just one year, that is what it is 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.860
 means it means that acquiring 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:28.420
 shinglas tile 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:30.400
 you will be sure your children are there grandchildren 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:34.050
 they will even be sure that the roof 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.050
 reliable roof will never flow 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.190
 if we look at the roof of the cottages 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.860
 which is behind me 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:47.140
 the roofs are quite interesting architectural 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.630
 expressive mail of this roof 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.940
 is about 600 square meters 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.790
 there are a lot of curvature 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.860
 bends and made such a roof all of 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:00.190
 metal tiles well, almost 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.540
 impossible from shingles such 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.360
 roof make it easy 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.400
 that is, if we take economic 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.979
 component of a complex roof you need 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.650
 understand that when a person buys 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:15.070
 metal by feature on metal 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.600
 is about forty percent on 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.810
 shingles from coldness not 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.690
 exceed the go percentage that is when you 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.550
 hear the cheaper metal price 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:28.830
 that is, you must add to it as well 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.830
 at least another 40 percent need to be taught 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.540
 if we look at shingles 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.610
 width with the volume we see that it has 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.420
 top rough surface 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:42.460
 winter snow falls on shingles and 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.720
 spring snow starts gradually 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:47.710
 gradually melts if we take 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.030
 metal tile then the surface is not and 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:55.180
 smooth in winter accumulates more 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:57.910
 or huge boulders fly huge 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.400
 pieces of snow than it is dangerous well how 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:03.490
 minimum they tear off the drainage system 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.950
 as the maximum they fall on the car 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:08.280
 fall on the machines so that it does not 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.340
 happened on the roofs of metal 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.960
 it is necessary to arrange a snow guard 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.920
 the device snow guards on flexible 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:19.090
 shinglas tiles 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:22.170
 you don't need a customer accordingly 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.170
 saves money 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.460
 on the metal roof is necessary 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.240
 perform 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:33.150
 grounding if you take the roof of the flexible 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:36.450
 tiles shinglas that battles are not 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.610
 attracts and lightning protection and grounding 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.400
 do not need to do that and accordingly 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:44.210
 on this man again very much 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:48.110
 save 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:48.950
 as for the installation of shingles 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.620
 shinglas then 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:56.030
 shinglas shingles are so fine 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:58.400
 piece material it is attached to the right with 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:01.250
 using the correct nails if you take 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:04.040
 metal then basically it is sheet and length 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.810
 at least six meters what does this mean 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:09.380
 shinglas shingles its very easy 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:11.830
 mount that is, many private owners on 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:15.250
 if this house is small they can 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:18.410
 mount the material on the roof themselves 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.660
 If you take a metal tile, then how 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.730
 at least two people should 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.770
 lodge two people must take 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:27.680
 accordingly, they labor 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:30.020
 grow accordingly due to simplicity 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:34.009
 mounting shinglas tile 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:36.919
 you again to save your money 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:38.779
 from school physics course we all know 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:41.509
 that the metal expands when heated 

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:44.869
 when cooling it compress if we 

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:47.300
 Consider the roof of metal 

00:04:44.869 --> 00:04:50.599
 talent in the heat it expands greatly 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:53.080
 winter at cooling it shrinks strongly 

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:56.379
 because of this linear expansion 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:59.020
 gradually fasteners screw begins 

00:04:56.379 --> 00:05:02.240
 climbs out accordingly 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:04.180
 various holes and water appear 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.800
 starts to penetrate the house 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:09.139
 shinglas shingles are made of 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:12.249
 bitumen bitumen has no linear 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:16.360
 extension so you completely 

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:16.360
 located with security 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:23.419
 as for comfort if the roof 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:26.180
 made of metal tiles then 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:27.699
 strong rain you in the house hear such 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.259
 distinctly drum roll 

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:32.360
 shinglas shingles are made of 

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:35.240
 bitumen about it completely absorbs sound 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:37.900
 and from a finger under such a roof you will be 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.759
 cozy comfort 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:43.870
 so compare shingles 

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:46.660
 shinglas with metal tiles i'm sure that 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:48.720
 you make your choice used flexible 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:51.460
 shane shingles as this is more 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.169
 reliable more durable more 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.419
 architectural expressive material 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:57.280
 buy better buy flexible 

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:59.610
