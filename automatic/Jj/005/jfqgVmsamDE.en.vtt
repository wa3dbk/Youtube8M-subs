00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.610 
it was kind of edging between a one bar
and<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.120> 3<00:00:45.360> bar<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.719> entire<00:00:45.989> game<00:00:46.200> because<00:00:46.500> the

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
and a 3 bar the entire game because the

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.220 
and a 3 bar the entire game because the
host<00:00:46.920> was<00:00:47.309> probably<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.510> worst<00:00:48.539> host<00:00:49.020> I've

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230

everything<00:01:06.930> in<00:01:07.260> life<00:01:07.470> takes<00:01:07.890> some<00:01:08.040> degree<00:01:08.580> of

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
everything in life takes some degree of

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.550 
everything in life takes some degree of
scale<00:01:09.000> it's<00:01:09.240> just<00:01:09.450> kind<00:01:09.659> of<00:01:09.750> easier<00:01:10.229> on<00:01:10.380> other

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560
