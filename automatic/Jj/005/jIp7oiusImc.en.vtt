00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:09.510
 good afternoon today we'll cook 

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:13.279
 sprats at home we cook 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:16.770
 Will sprats in a slow cooker 

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:20.240
 since in my opinion this is the easiest 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:23.240
 a way to cook sprats at home 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.240
 conditions 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:31.060
 as we have a large fish and us 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.450
 have to brush 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:39.100
 if the fish is small, then in principle it can 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:42.790
 do not clean but this matter of taste can 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:45.120
 clean you can cook whole we have three 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:49.540
 around and so we were mine 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.579
 clean also for cooking us 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:56.489
 would need 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.489
 vegetable or sunflower oil 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:08.070
 tea leaves 2 tablespoons of top well so 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:11.950
 how about we have my fish 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:16.289
 less than a kilo so on 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:21.310
 a kilo will go a glass of vegetable oil 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:25.440
 here tea leaves will go a little less 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:29.310
 already the most brewed in the recipe is written 2 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:32.500
 tablespoons with the top we up to a glass 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:39.310
 we added a little less well and and 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:41.400
 spices pepper and cloves we are now 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:45.770
 brew 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:51.390
 our tea and we will clean 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:56.040
 to clean our my brewing brew 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:02:02.730
 it means washing it to us and cleaning it and 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:12.170
 we are here in this way are laid 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:12.170
 our multicooker now we just take 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.560
 Bay leaf 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:26.180
 we lay it out pour our 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.069
 sunflower oil 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.819
 thereafter 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:56.069
 fill our my per watt 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:03:00.930
 who talked here that hit 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:04.470
 inside is nothing like that 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:08.069
 we have large we will be forced 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:12.500
 add some water after all 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:19.079
 ideally you need water a little bit 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:24.019
 cover our fish he add also 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:24.019
 our specialists and arises 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:28.069
 black pepper peas 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:36.290
 all this we add our 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.500
 multivan 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:50.720
 a little inconvenient to shoot with one hand and 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:53.690
 cook grows my 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:57.140
 the fact that a little bit of tea leaves is nothing 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:59.930
 scary tea leaves will give the fish 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:03.590
 the fortress that is, it will not be broken 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:07.610
 and accordingly, I think it will work out 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:10.989
 the knife will be the color that we are used to 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.989
 see in regular stores 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:23.270

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:48.410
 a tablespoon of salt is all 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:51.760
 ingredients we added means on 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:57.200
 a kilo of fish goes 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:05:00.200
 a glass of sunflower oil a glass 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:06.760

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:12.880

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:31.680
 to make the fish more straight you can 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:36.830
 add also sweet peas and now 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:43.020
 we put all this in our multicooker 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:50.520
 then here we choose the function y 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:51.570
 me function 2 is quenching our time 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:58.010
 already exposed 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:06:01.010
 90 minutes or an hour and a half and we give 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.010
 start 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:08.110

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:12.409

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:32.660
 This is how our sprats look 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:36.630
 crock-pot so we can notice 

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:40.040

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:44.400
 almost like a shop 

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:49.260
