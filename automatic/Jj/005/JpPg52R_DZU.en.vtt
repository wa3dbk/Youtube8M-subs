00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:20.340
 dear ladies and gentlemen dear 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.110
 Colleagues warmly 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.970
 Welcome to the press conference 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.900
 our home game against first fc 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.699
 Kaiserslautern 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.470
 I'm allowed to take both coaches up here 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.840
 We welcome franco foda and holger 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.340
 Stanislavsky coach of the guest team 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.400
 has the first word 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.170
 I emphasize your statement about the game 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.089
 We think we have a great one today 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.059
 soccer game seen by two 

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:44.190
 the teams are very offensive 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.190
 they were oriented to the end 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.170
 have tried to win this game 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.750
 about the defensive problems so ours 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.170
 team we want something today 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.660
 to ignore it is ultimately 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.180
 We are also very satisfied with the point 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.500
 but before the game, many had 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.969
 injury problems even in the 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.489
 half-time I have to change twice 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.920
 because of injuries and insofar 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.360
 is huge compliment to the team 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.430
 after the residue by two times 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.929
 came back and as already mentioned 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.979
 a great game , too 

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:17.310
 In the end, that was a draw 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.819
 justified and cologne a great game 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.910
 made 

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:22.770
 fans spectators were excited my 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:26.690
 you are a bit strained 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.690
 due to the unnecessary goentore though 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:31.500
 point brought in cologne at a very 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.750
 good team therefore was mine 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.539
 satisfied at home 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:40.410
 thank you mister foda thank you rod like 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:42.920
 your conclusion looks yes I must 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.920
 say that 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.910
 every spectator in the stadium was exactly like that 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:52.260
 a game has earned 45,000 spectators 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:54.750
 from Friday evening is already gigantic 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.640
 difficult weather conditions 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:02.800
 Outstandingly good game both 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:04.180
 teams did not pay anything 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.280
 just as fun as a trainer 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.310
 to have been there and fun 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.230
 It does not have to take part in such games 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:15.010
 every week you hear a bit 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.480
 in the vote and I think that's true 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.150
 We both do not always work 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.420
 just fit this evening that was 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.410
 I believe the correct result the 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.690
 right game 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.000
 l have not had many lately 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:31.090
 such games are also seen in the 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.620
 second league was really good my 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.840
 Team has first half time faith 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.690
 I have very much done right 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.880
 then out of the blue in residue 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.620
 then come back come again 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.480
 then we had problems in the second 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.870
 halftime kaiserslautern the game more 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:49.390
 and has nominated more because we just 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.400
 then far too passive too 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.310
 were a bit too much too 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.560
 manage this 221 are then 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.090
 itself come back again and it 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:03.190
 just fit everything it was in total 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:04.720
 I believe a deserved 3 to 3 with 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:10.260
 a really good mood in the stadium 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.260
 and great game also for us trainer
