00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
here I'm going to add a little bit of

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.609 
here I'm going to add a little bit of
vinegar<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.600> this<00:01:51.720> is<00:01:51.780> what<00:01:52.110> should<00:01:52.320> happen

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
vinegar and this is what should happen

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.130 
vinegar and this is what should happen
if<00:01:52.920> it's<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.159> boy

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.200 

it<00:01:58.140> should<00:01:58.350> foam<00:01:58.560> up<00:01:58.799> I<00:01:59.009> mean<00:01:59.280> maybe<00:01:59.549> not<00:01:59.640> VAT

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
it should foam up I mean maybe not VAT

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.200 
it should foam up I mean maybe not VAT
erratically<00:02:01.070> but<00:02:02.070> it<00:02:02.189> should<00:02:02.399> still<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:03.090> you

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
erratically but it should still and you

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.700 
erratically but it should still and you
can<00:02:03.390> see<00:02:03.570> how<00:02:03.689> it's<00:02:03.869> forming<00:02:04.259> stone<00:02:04.530> the

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
can see how it's forming stone the

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.859 
can see how it's forming stone the
bottom<00:02:05.100> I<00:02:06.500> know<00:02:07.500> if<00:02:07.619> you<00:02:07.710> can<00:02:07.890> hear<00:02:08.160> it<00:02:08.310> but

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
bottom I know if you can hear it but

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.360 
bottom I know if you can hear it but
it's<00:02:09.869> still<00:02:10.050> foaming<00:02:10.560> pretty<00:02:10.800> good<00:02:10.979> and<00:02:11.220> it's

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
it's still foaming pretty good and it's

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.860 
it's still foaming pretty good and it's
still<00:02:11.640> fizzling<00:02:11.970> a<00:02:12.180> lot

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
still fizzling a lot

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.430 
still fizzling a lot
so<00:02:13.870> if<00:02:13.960> it's<00:02:14.110> a<00:02:14.200> boy<00:02:15.870> that's<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:17.080> kind<00:02:17.350> of

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
so if it's a boy that's the kind of

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.290 
so if it's a boy that's the kind of
reaction<00:02:17.710> you're<00:02:17.950> looking<00:02:18.250> for<00:02:18.460> if<00:02:18.910> it's<00:02:19.210> a

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
reaction you're looking for if it's a

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.890 
reaction you're looking for if it's a
