hand<00:01:07.020> on<00:01:07.170> right<00:01:07.350> other<00:01:07.860> than<00:01:08.100> that<00:01:08.189> it's

hand on right other than that it's
identical<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.600> then<00:01:10.049> you<00:01:10.140> think<00:01:10.380> that<00:01:10.530> all<00:01:10.680> of

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
identical and then you think that all of

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.450 
identical and then you think that all of
these<00:01:10.920> sections<00:01:11.189> are<00:01:11.520> hollow<00:01:12.650> so<00:01:13.650> we<00:01:13.680> figured

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
these sections are hollow so we figured

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.010 
these sections are hollow so we figured
out<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.610> way<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:14.880> mold<00:01:15.270> in<00:01:15.450> all<00:01:15.570> of<00:01:15.689> these<00:01:15.810> hollow

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
out a way to mold in all of these hollow

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.780 
out a way to mold in all of these hollow
sections<00:01:16.500> in<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.770> single<00:01:17.070> piece<00:01:17.250> without

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
sections in a single piece without

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.550 
sections in a single piece without
having<00:01:18.210> lots<00:01:18.390> of<00:01:18.540> semi<00:01:18.840> structural<00:01:19.320> things

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
having lots of semi structural things

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.219 
having lots of semi structural things
that<00:01:19.770> are<00:01:19.860> then<00:01:19.950> bonded<00:01:20.310> together<00:01:20.630> it's<00:01:21.630> truly

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
that are then bonded together it's truly

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.910 
that are then bonded together it's truly
remarkable<00:01:23.180> let's<00:01:24.180> see<00:01:24.299> how<00:01:24.390> line<00:01:24.630> is<00:01:25.549> Wow

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
remarkable let's see how line is Wow

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.810 
remarkable let's see how line is Wow
suppressing<00:01:28.920> I<00:01:29.009> can<00:01:29.159> double<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.549> weight<00:01:29.700> of

that's<00:01:38.520> because<00:01:38.820> they're<00:01:38.939> very<00:01:39.090> functional

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
that's because they're very functional

that's because they're very functional
redesign<00:01:39.869> so<00:01:40.710> one<00:01:41.220> of<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.430> things<00:01:41.490> when<00:01:41.820> you

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
redesign so one of the things when you

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.700 
redesign so one of the things when you
sit<00:01:42.119> in<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.329> car<00:01:42.540> that<00:01:42.689> you'll<00:01:42.869> notice<00:01:43.200> is

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
sit in the car that you'll notice is

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.289 
sit in the car that you'll notice is
first<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.220> all<00:01:44.369> if<00:01:44.460> you<00:01:44.579> have<00:01:44.729> an<00:01:44.820> incredibly

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
first of all if you have an incredibly

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.719 
first of all if you have an incredibly
good<00:01:45.600> for<00:01:46.079> disability<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.950> basically<00:01:47.340> screen

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
good for disability the basically screen

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:48.410 
good for disability the basically screen
is<00:01:47.850> so<00:01:48.030> low

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
is so low

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.450 
is so low
yeah<00:01:48.720> sometimes<00:01:49.380> afraid<00:01:49.650> of<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.950> f1<00:01:50.220> that<00:01:50.369> we

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
yeah sometimes afraid of the f1 that we
