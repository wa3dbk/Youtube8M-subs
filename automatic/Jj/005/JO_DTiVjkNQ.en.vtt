 may simonetta of shirt tie 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.119
 dot com 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.520
 today we talk about casual first 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:29.150
 let's make some clarity there are three 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:31.700
 types of clothing exist 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.700
 formal or elegant clothing in 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.930
 whose return to the tuit tux or all 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.469
 with clothing for occasions 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:42.190
 very important and very elegant 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:45.290
 semi formal clothing because it is 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:48.190
 consisting of the dress is clothing 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:50.780
 casual casual wear 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:54.500
 the most classic example I can give you is 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:59.329
 that of a blazer and a pair of 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:02.200
 gray trousers, however, often yes 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:04.610
 consider all these three degrees of 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.750
 clothing all these three types of 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.530
 clothing like clothing 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.090
 elegant or formal indeed it is not so 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.840
 and especially on casual 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:19.460
 there is a lot of confusion often for the 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.960
 casual identifies a t shirt a 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.240
 pair of jeans not for shoes 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.399
 classic as you saw from the example 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.289
 previous I did when I got 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:28.999
 talked about clothing case we have 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:31.789
 given the example of a blue blazer and a 

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:33.109
 pair of gray pants you see that not 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:39.619
 I have spoken neither of sneakers 

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:42.829
 in jeans and in t shirts because they are thick 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:45.080
 yes there is this error we say 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:49.070
 in identifying a 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:50.450
 a jacket a blue blazer with a pair of 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.870
 gray trousers as clothing 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:57.500
 elegant is a t shirt with jeans and like 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:02:00.470
 case clothing because there are various 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.620
 house types and every kind of case is 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:06.530
 suitable for different occasions I have 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:09.560
 identified the five these five types 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:14.060
 business casual is part of the business 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:16.370
 casual what is the step that just 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.830
 under the clothing business so 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:22.190
 below the casual business environment 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.440
 you can wear it in companies where not 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:28.340
 is required as a dress code 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:30.560
 strict and therefore business clothing 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:34.640
 it will be there too typical one kidney 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:38.620
 broken then we have another kind of 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:41.090
 home that is a casual chic 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.390
 in short, a clothing anyway 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.130
 relaxed but very well cared for 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.489
 among other things this kind of 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:51.650
 clothing is often more expensive in 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.110
 price terms of a clothing 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.540
 business 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:58.519
 there is another type of house and this 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:02.800
 we can consider that clothing 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:08.000
 which we call sportswear 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:11.120
 without doing any kind of activity 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.010
 physical a relaxed clothing where 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.860
 however there is always some care 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:19.550
 extended some attention in dressing 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:21.980
 and which also demonstrates the commitment of 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.600
 interest you have in what you are 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.290
 doing so go to eat pizza 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:29.780
 with the girl or go home friends a 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.959
 see the game as long as you are 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.500
 relaxed it is not demanding 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.590
 etc 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.140
 however, show some care in the 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.520
 billion 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:44.770
 and presented in front of other people 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.810
 the two following categories are those 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.340
 which are absolutely not indicated for 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.080
 important meetings for meetings 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.360
 business or for those meetings 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.630
 where important your image and elia 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:04:00.580
 put the emphasis on your credibility 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:05.230
 on your importance then we will have a 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:09.760
 case at the weekend suitable that weekend 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:11.920
 which will pass in relax of known for 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:15.040
 come down to shop in the shop 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.459
 under the house or to bring out the 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.320
 dog 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:19.630
 always bear in mind that 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.680
 however there is a minimum of interaction 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.320
 with the others 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:27.160
 and here we could go 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:28.450
 well the jeans the slice and the t shirt with 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.440
 sneakers 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:34.690
 the next the last category of the 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:38.260
 al case will be the one intended for 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:41.530
 physical activity or for da 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.669
 use when you stay at home and if 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:46.479
 sure no one comes to see us 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:47.890
 then the sweat suit and the shoe from 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:50.320
 gym 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:52.419
 you can use it if necessary for 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:55.510
 stain the garden to wash the 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:58.090
 your car but nothing more 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:00.790
 when you are in doubt rather better 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:02.770
 put on something more than something in 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:04.690
 the less you will always have time to say that 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.700
 subsequently you have another type of 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:09.070
 commitment 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:13.180
 I have prepared guidelines tables 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:16.500
 with the various case to the goal of which we have 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:19.210
 spoken today with the attires 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.390
 recommended for each category if you do 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.919
 a jump on the blog you can find them 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:27.130
 obviously they are simply gods 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:30.070
 guidelines as always for now vi 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:33.120
 I greet and thank you and see you soon 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.120
