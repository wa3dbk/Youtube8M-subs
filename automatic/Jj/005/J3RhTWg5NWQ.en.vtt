00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
the free mr. you've turned the scan

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.269 
the free mr. you've turned the scan
lanes<00:00:21.689> off<00:00:22.730> can<00:00:23.730> turn<00:00:24.119> them<00:00:24.330> back<00:00:24.510> on<00:00:25.220> to<00:00:26.220> be

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
lanes off can turn them back on to be

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.470 
lanes off can turn them back on to be
honest<00:00:26.490> I<00:00:26.580> don't<00:00:26.640> think<00:00:26.789> that<00:00:26.970> we<00:00:27.060> need<00:00:27.300> to

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
honest I don't think that we need to

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.790 
honest I don't think that we need to
scan<00:00:27.660> lines<00:00:27.900> because<00:00:28.109> they<00:00:28.199> never<00:00:28.349> add<00:00:28.529> up<00:00:28.710> in

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
scan lines because they never add up in

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.870 
scan lines because they never add up in
the<00:00:28.890> first<00:00:29.070> place<00:00:29.929> so<00:00:31.009> well<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.340> know<00:00:32.520> anyway

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
the first place so well to know anyway

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.260 
the first place so well to know anyway
just<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:33.600> show<00:00:33.809> you<00:00:33.870> what<00:00:33.960> it<00:00:34.020> looks<00:00:34.170> like<00:00:35.270> see

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
just to show you what it looks like see

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.389 
just to show you what it looks like see
the<00:00:36.420> scan<00:00:36.630> lines<00:00:36.840> look<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.020> little<00:00:37.380> bit<00:00:37.620> odd<00:00:40.399> so

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
the scan lines look a little bit odd so

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.180 
the scan lines look a little bit odd so
what<00:00:41.879> I'll<00:00:42.000> do<00:00:42.149> is<00:00:42.180> I'll<00:00:42.620> turn<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.739> skylines

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
what I'll do is I'll turn the skylines

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.889 
what I'll do is I'll turn the skylines

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:11.890 

I<00:02:03.940> asked<00:02:04.940> us<00:02:05.150> stupid<00:02:05.360> Whitely<00:02:05.810> controls

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.320 

all<00:02:12.900> right<00:02:13.050> so<00:02:13.170> I<00:02:13.260> stopped<00:02:13.500> it

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
all right so I stopped it

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.030 
all right so I stopped it
I'm<00:02:15.330> real<00:02:15.660> closer<00:02:15.900> look<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:16.470> then<00:02:16.680> I'll<00:02:16.830> swap

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
I'm real closer look and then I'll swap

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:25.580 
I'm real closer look and then I'll swap
you<00:02:17.069> back<00:02:17.340> to<00:02:17.489> the<00:02:17.580> TV<00:02:24.140> that's<00:02:25.140> supposed<00:02:25.530> to

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
you back to the TV that's supposed to

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.100 
you back to the TV that's supposed to
look<00:02:25.709> a<00:02:25.830> speed<00:02:26.480> well<00:02:27.480> this<00:02:27.629> doesn't<00:02:27.840> mean<00:02:28.019> you

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
look a speed well this doesn't mean you

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.240 
look a speed well this doesn't mean you
look<00:02:28.230> that<00:02:28.379> much<00:02:28.530> better

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
look that much better

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.869 
look that much better
the<00:02:29.459> readers<00:02:29.849> I<00:02:29.970> think<00:02:31.549> did<00:02:32.549> you<00:02:32.610> know<00:02:32.670> a<00:02:32.700> nice

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
the readers I think did you know a nice

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:33.289 
the readers I think did you know a nice
thing

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
thing

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:35.119 
thing
well<00:02:33.690> then<00:02:33.810> again<00:02:34.019> you<00:02:34.290> upscaling<00:02:34.680> for<00:02:34.920> for

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129 
well then again you upscaling for for

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:42.259 
well then again you upscaling for for
EDP<00:02:36.709> to<00:02:39.110> 720<00:02:40.280> pause<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.400> TV<00:02:41.610> I'll<00:02:41.879> probably<00:02:42.090> do

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
EDP to 720 pause the TV I'll probably do

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:46.520 
EDP to 720 pause the TV I'll probably do
a<00:02:42.299> technical<00:02:42.630> job<00:02:42.930> of<00:02:43.110> that<00:02:45.290> we'll<00:02:46.290> try<00:02:46.500> it

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
a technical job of that we'll try it

00:02:46.530 --> 00:03:58.380 
a technical job of that we'll try it
anyway

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.710 

then<00:03:59.920> those<00:04:00.920> pesky<00:04:01.220> TV<00:04:01.700> controls<00:04:02.090> again<00:04:02.360> turn

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
then those pesky TV controls again turn

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.400 
then those pesky TV controls again turn
the<00:04:02.840> leg<00:04:02.960> off<00:04:04.270> they<00:04:05.270> just<00:04:05.510> broke<00:04:05.630> my<00:04:05.690> control

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
the leg off they just broke my control

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:15.460 
the leg off they just broke my control
that<00:04:13.450> so<00:04:14.450> but<00:04:14.600> I<00:04:14.660> guess<00:04:14.930> it<00:04:15.080> took<00:04:15.200> a<00:04:15.260> bit<00:04:15.440> longer

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
that so but I guess it took a bit longer

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:21.640 
that so but I guess it took a bit longer
than<00:04:15.830> 6<00:04:16.010> min<00:04:16.870> now<00:04:17.870> if<00:04:17.930> I<00:04:18.110> go<00:04:18.380> to<00:04:20.620> hopefully<00:04:21.620> I

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
than 6 min now if I go to hopefully I

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:29.170 
than 6 min now if I go to hopefully I
plug<00:04:21.920> this<00:04:22.040> in<00:04:22.220> right<00:04:22.250> I<00:04:22.960> have<00:04:28.030> that's<00:04:29.030> the

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
plug this in right I have that's the

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.930 
plug this in right I have that's the
refill<00:04:29.630> component<00:04:30.490> despite<00:04:31.490> that<00:04:31.640> going

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
refill component despite that going

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.240 
refill component despite that going
through<00:04:32.060> there<00:04:32.360> go<00:04:33.080> for<00:04:33.260> my<00:04:33.380> Samson<00:04:33.770> LCD

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
through there go for my Samson LCD

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.060 
through there go for my Samson LCD
television<00:04:34.820> no<00:04:35.120> scaler<00:04:36.110> nothing<00:04:36.800> like<00:04:36.920> our

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
television no scaler nothing like our

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:43.780 
television no scaler nothing like our
involved<00:04:41.830> par<00:04:42.830> for<00:04:43.010> the<00:04:43.070> screen<00:04:43.310> being<00:04:43.490> a<00:04:43.610> bit

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
involved par for the screen being a bit

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.270 
involved par for the screen being a bit
brighter

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
brighter

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.170 
brighter
well<00:04:46.280> maybe<00:04:46.520> it's<00:04:46.850> slightly<00:04:47.510> nicer<00:04:48.350> looking

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
well maybe it's slightly nicer looking

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.180 
well maybe it's slightly nicer looking
through<00:04:50.180> the<00:04:50.330> scalar<00:04:50.810> but<00:04:51.340> very<00:04:52.340> very<00:04:52.730> minimal

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
through the scalar but very very minimal

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.500 
through the scalar but very very minimal
it's<00:04:55.190> not<00:04:55.340> really<00:04:55.550> meant<00:04:55.760> for<00:04:55.850> upscaling

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510 
it's not really meant for upscaling

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:00.910 
it's not really meant for upscaling
