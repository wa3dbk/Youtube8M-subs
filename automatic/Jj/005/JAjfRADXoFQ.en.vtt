00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.150
 so she can welcome you warmly 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.130
 to the last hacker pschorr fantalk im 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.679
 football year 2014 after the home game 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:15.299
 against Kaiserslautern here in the sixties 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:19.500
 club with me is martina martina long 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.699
 led against the fifth table against 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.609
 you also have to draw first 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.930
 plays what outweighs the graphic like 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.980
 is the mood in the cabin or 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:31.019
 you are happy about the point gained 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.759
 yes, I think that pretty much 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.920
 are disappointed when you are so close to the 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.530
 end nor the compensatory get it 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.450
 of course very bitter and Swiss 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.170
 Everybody wanted to go everything 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.730
 but the women did have that 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.829
 agree a point because us in the 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.100
 situation you can every point satisfied 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.840
 his 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.250
 anyway with the current situation in 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.730
 five times at home in a row 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.309
 lost 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.469
 it's probably too difficult 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.050
 to come out of this valley today 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:09.690
 one point is that one point for 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:12.360
 Confidence does not look that way 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.650
 rise and as I believe is always 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.960
 have shown quite a decent performance 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.580
 And you can be satisfied 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.950
 it does have seen every stone 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.690
 fought from the first minute you all have 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.760
 really very good game 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.920
 then comes the goal then comes the 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.780
 compensation was a similar situation 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.460
 like the kmu against the ksc 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.960
 you had fast meat cattle meat 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.120
 against the circle against them 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.810
 I do not think so 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.220
 Of course, I can not do anything about it now 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.650
 say because I played no castings 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.720
 but I do not believe that one 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.130
 After all, there is room to think about it 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.870
 If you focus only on the current one 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.420
 situation and tries to give everything 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.800
 yes if it was again tight and smoke 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.320
 a little exciting there was mine 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.590
 name is still a part of in 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.360
 Leipzig takes something from tonight 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:03.300
 to the last game 2014 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.610
 I think I fought a lot together 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.020
 in solidarity and I think that's good 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.479
 is and you can build on that and 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.560
 if you want to play the next game 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.490
 I'm sure you can do more 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.380
 functions will be 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.450
 We hope so too and finally 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.959

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:26.870
 60s print the result that today 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:31.340

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:34.459
