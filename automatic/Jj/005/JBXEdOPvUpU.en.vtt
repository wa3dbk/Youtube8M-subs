00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.330 

I<00:00:00.210> get<00:00:00.960> a<00:00:00.989> lot<00:00:01.110> of<00:00:01.170> questions<00:00:01.680> about<00:00:01.829> setting

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
I get a lot of questions about setting

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:03.800 
I get a lot of questions about setting
the<00:00:02.460> float<00:00:02.669> so<00:00:02.879> I<00:00:02.909> thought<00:00:03.179> I'd<00:00:03.360> go<00:00:03.540> through

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
the float so I thought I'd go through

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.800 
the float so I thought I'd go through
that<00:00:03.959> with<00:00:04.170> you<00:00:04.350> I<00:00:05.250> set<00:00:06.150> the<00:00:06.240> floats<00:00:06.480> a<00:00:06.600> little

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
that with you I set the floats a little

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.450 
that with you I set the floats a little
differently<00:00:07.109> than<00:00:07.230> the<00:00:07.470> factory<00:00:07.890> i<00:00:08.010> set<00:00:08.340> the

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
differently than the factory i set the

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.379 
differently than the factory i set the
ends<00:00:08.730> at<00:00:08.849> 23<00:00:09.809> 30<00:00:10.110> seconds<00:00:10.679> in<00:00:11.090> the<00:00:12.090> middle<00:00:12.330> of

ends at 23 30 seconds in the middle of
21<00:00:12.870> 30<00:00:13.139> seconds<00:00:13.650> they<00:00:13.740> both<00:00:13.920> have<00:00:14.130> a<00:00:14.160> one<00:00:14.490> in

21 30 seconds they both have a one in

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.790 
21 30 seconds they both have a one in
twenty<00:00:15.059> four<00:00:15.269> thirty<00:00:15.509> second<00:00:15.960> drop<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.440> drug

name<00:00:17.010> is<00:00:17.279> a<00:00:17.400> factory<00:00:17.820> there<00:00:18.750> are<00:00:19.560> two<00:00:19.680> kind<00:00:19.949> of

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
name is a factory there are two kind of

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.250 
name is a factory there are two kind of
floats<00:00:20.310> here<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:21.150> original<00:00:21.600> brass<00:00:21.869> floats

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
floats here the original brass floats

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.710 
floats here the original brass floats
for<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.890> end<00:00:23.340> carburetors<00:00:23.910> for<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.180> 66

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
for the end carburetors for the 66

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.410 
for the end carburetors for the 66
Center<00:00:25.109> is<00:00:25.260> a<00:00:25.320> little<00:00:25.619> larger<00:00:26.010> than<00:00:26.420> than

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
Center is a little larger than than

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.750 
Center is a little larger than than
other<00:00:27.599> brass<00:00:27.900> floats<00:00:28.199> available<00:00:28.800> it's<00:00:29.580> not

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
other brass floats available it's not

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.150 
other brass floats available it's not
available<00:00:30.000> anymore<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:31.349> brass<00:00:31.590> floats<00:00:31.830> or

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
available anymore the brass floats or

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.650 
available anymore the brass floats or
just<00:00:32.430> not<00:00:32.579> being<00:00:32.759> made<00:00:33.000> do<00:00:33.360> you<00:00:33.420> have<00:00:33.540> an

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
just not being made do you have an

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.560 
just not being made do you have an
original<00:00:33.840> one<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.410> it's<00:00:34.950> good<00:00:35.360> reuse<00:00:36.360> it

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
original one and it's good reuse it

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.510 
original one and it's good reuse it
otherwise<00:00:37.320> you're<00:00:37.559> going<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.739> get<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.309> new

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
otherwise you're going to get a new

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.110 
otherwise you're going to get a new
float<00:00:38.879> that's<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.719> composite<00:00:40.290> material<00:00:41.120> when

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
float that's a composite material when

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.779 
float that's a composite material when
you<00:00:42.239> set<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.600> float<00:00:42.809> level<00:00:43.040> you're<00:00:44.040> using<00:00:44.550> the

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
you set the float level you're using the

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.850 
you set the float level you're using the
line<00:00:45.000> right<00:00:45.239> in<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.510> center<00:00:45.870> on<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.110> brass

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
line right in the center on the brass

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.440 
line right in the center on the brass
one<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.460> they've<00:00:47.610> been<00:00:47.700> kind<00:00:48.000> enough<00:00:48.059> on<00:00:48.360> the

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
one and they've been kind enough on the

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.389 
one and they've been kind enough on the
neoprene<00:00:48.870> as<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.140> little<00:00:49.469> race<00:00:49.649> line<00:00:50.010> know<00:00:50.219> that

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
neoprene as a little race line know that

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.689 
neoprene as a little race line know that
you'll<00:00:50.520> be<00:00:50.610> able<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.940> see<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.870> set<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.410> float

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:52.699 
you'll be able to see to set the float

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:57.110 
you'll be able to see to set the float
so<00:00:54.140> fast<00:00:55.140> went<00:00:55.440> in<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:55.710> said<00:00:55.949> set<00:00:56.610> before<00:00:57.000> you

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
so fast went in and said set before you

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.290 
so fast went in and said set before you
I've<00:00:58.109> had<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.379> 20<00:00:58.800> that's<00:00:59.219> probably<00:00:59.550> set<00:01:00.059> right

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
I've had a 20 that's probably set right

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:09.800 
I've had a 20 that's probably set right
so<00:01:01.010> I'll<00:01:02.010> change<00:01:02.340> it<00:01:02.520> right

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.710 

so<00:01:10.810> it<00:01:10.900> should<00:01:11.200> be<00:01:11.700> 23<00:01:12.700> 30<00:01:12.940> seconds<00:01:13.450> from<00:01:13.600> the

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
so it should be 23 30 seconds from the

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.500 
so it should be 23 30 seconds from the
gasket<00:01:14.170> to<00:01:14.200> the<00:01:14.380> middle<00:01:14.620> of<00:01:14.710> the<00:01:14.770> seam

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:15.510 
gasket to the middle of the seam

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:21.540 
gasket to the middle of the seam
measured<00:01:16.510> with<00:01:16.660> a<00:01:16.690> float<00:01:16.960> page<00:01:18.870> and<00:01:20.400> in<00:01:21.400> this

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.550 
measured with a float page and in this

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.460 
measured with a float page and in this
case<00:01:21.790> like<00:01:22.060> I<00:01:22.150> say<00:01:22.330> it<00:01:22.510> it's<00:01:22.990> right<00:01:23.260> on<00:01:23.290> the

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
case like I say it it's right on the

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.560 
case like I say it it's right on the
money<00:01:23.590> 23<00:01:24.220> 30<00:01:24.430> seconds<00:01:24.850> that<00:01:24.940> way<00:01:25.090> you<00:01:25.150> can<00:01:25.360> see

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
money 23 30 seconds that way you can see

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.180 
money 23 30 seconds that way you can see
where<00:01:25.720> to<00:01:25.810> measure<00:01:26.020> when<00:01:26.740> you<00:01:26.830> need<00:01:26.980> to<00:01:27.100> adjust

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
where to measure when you need to adjust

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.800 
where to measure when you need to adjust
that<00:01:27.580> i'll<00:01:27.790> adjust<00:01:27.910> it<00:01:28.360> to<00:01:30.300> i'll<00:01:31.300> adjust<00:01:31.450> it<00:01:31.780> to

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
that i'll adjust it to i'll adjust it to

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.460 
that i'll adjust it to i'll adjust it to
21<00:01:32.229> 30<00:01:32.620> seconds<00:01:33.070> here<00:01:33.190> yeah<00:01:33.940> oh<00:01:34.290> it's<00:01:35.290> done

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
21 30 seconds here yeah oh it's done

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.170 
21 30 seconds here yeah oh it's done
when<00:01:35.650> you<00:01:35.770> just<00:01:36.040> the<00:01:36.160> float<00:01:36.400> never<00:01:36.640> put<00:01:36.880> on<00:01:37.090> the

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
when you just the float never put on the

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.440 
when you just the float never put on the
float<00:01:37.740> break<00:01:38.740> it<00:01:38.950> you<00:01:39.310> bend<00:01:39.880> it<00:01:40.000> right<00:01:40.150> here<00:01:40.360> in

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
float break it you bend it right here in

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.499 
float break it you bend it right here in
the<00:01:40.540> middle<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.920> place<00:01:42.250> used<00:01:42.670> to<00:01:43.000> use<00:01:43.180> a<00:01:43.210> pair

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:43.509 
the middle the place used to use a pair

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:45.900 
the middle the place used to use a pair
of<00:01:43.540> needlenose<00:01:43.869> I<00:01:44.350> did<00:01:44.950> say<00:01:45.430> something<00:01:45.729> wrong

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:45.910 
of needlenose I did say something wrong

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:50.130 
of needlenose I did say something wrong
the<00:01:46.450> center<00:01:46.780> one<00:01:46.990> is<00:01:47.890> 21<00:01:48.729> 30<00:01:48.970> seconds<00:01:49.420> not<00:01:49.570> 23

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
the center one is 21 30 seconds not 23

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.440 
the center one is 21 30 seconds not 23
and<00:01:50.770> I've<00:01:50.860> adjusted<00:01:50.979> it<00:01:51.460> down<00:01:51.670> to<00:01:51.970> write<00:01:52.330> about

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
and I've adjusted it down to write about

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.820 
and I've adjusted it down to write about
21<00:01:53.310> 21<00:01:54.310> 22<00:01:54.850> somewhere<00:01:55.270> in<00:01:55.330> there<00:01:55.590> this<00:01:56.590> is<00:01:56.800> a

the web page they might be available

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.530 
the web page they might be available
other<00:02:02.920> places<00:02:03.400> but<00:02:03.550> I<00:02:03.610> prefer<00:02:04.090> them<00:02:04.270> over<00:02:04.300> the

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
other places but I prefer them over the

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.480 
other places but I prefer them over the
two-piece<00:02:04.960> then<00:02:05.770> the<00:02:05.890> other<00:02:06.100> thing<00:02:06.190> you<00:02:06.400> have

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
two-piece then the other thing you have

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.590 
two-piece then the other thing you have
to<00:02:06.640> set<00:02:06.940> is<00:02:07.119> the<00:02:07.300> float<00:02:07.540> drop<00:02:07.869> flip<00:02:08.739> drop<00:02:09.100> is

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
to set is the float drop flip drop is

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.820 
to set is the float drop flip drop is
adjusted<00:02:10.600> with<00:02:10.750> this<00:02:10.929> tab<00:02:11.230> on<00:02:11.440> the<00:02:11.470> back<00:02:11.709> of

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
adjusted with this tab on the back of

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:18.060 
adjusted with this tab on the back of
the<00:02:11.920> float<00:02:14.130> just<00:02:15.180> people<00:02:16.180> in<00:02:16.420> Sea<00:02:16.600> area<00:02:17.070> so

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
the float just people in Sea area so

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.030 
the float just people in Sea area so
when<00:02:18.220> you<00:02:18.690> measure<00:02:19.690> the<00:02:19.989> drop<00:02:20.200> you<00:02:20.470> let<00:02:20.890> it

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
when you measure the drop you let it

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.300 
when you measure the drop you let it
drop<00:02:21.989> your<00:02:22.989> mission<00:02:23.320> from<00:02:23.470> the<00:02:23.530> gasket<00:02:24.040> to<00:02:24.190> the

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
drop your mission from the gasket to the

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.370 
drop your mission from the gasket to the
bottom<00:02:24.640> of<00:02:24.700> the<00:02:24.760> float<00:02:25.030> the<00:02:25.780> folks<00:02:26.019> should<00:02:26.230> be

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
bottom of the float the folks should be

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.640 
bottom of the float the folks should be
somewhat<00:02:26.890> level<00:02:27.340> at<00:02:28.150> this<00:02:28.390> point<00:02:28.690> and<00:02:28.930> it

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
somewhat level at this point and it

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.270 
somewhat level at this point and it
should<00:02:30.160> be<00:02:30.190> one<00:02:30.519> in<00:02:30.730> 24<00:02:31.360> 30<00:02:31.600> seconds<00:02:32.140> you<00:02:33.100> can

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
should be one in 24 30 seconds you can

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.300 
should be one in 24 30 seconds you can
see<00:02:33.459> it's<00:02:33.640> about<00:02:34.150> one<00:02:34.390> in<00:02:34.510> 18<00:02:34.959> but<00:02:35.769> you<00:02:35.890> can<00:02:36.130> do

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
see it's about one in 18 but you can do

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.220 
see it's about one in 18 but you can do
this<00:02:36.459> with<00:02:36.519> your<00:02:36.790> fingers<00:02:37.150> make<00:02:37.870> sure<00:02:37.900> you're

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
this with your fingers make sure you're

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.530 
this with your fingers make sure you're
bending<00:02:38.500> the<00:02:38.739> tab<00:02:38.920> only<00:02:39.370> bring<00:02:40.239> it<00:02:40.360> down<00:02:40.510> a

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
bending the tab only bring it down a

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:57.809 
bending the tab only bring it down a
little<00:02:40.810> bit<00:02:44.730> 120

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:01.410 

one<00:02:58.450> in<00:02:58.569> 24<00:02:59.109> 30<00:02:59.349> seconds<00:02:59.829> so<00:03:00.790> that's<00:03:00.999> the<00:03:01.209> float

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
one in 24 30 seconds so that's the float

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.780 
one in 24 30 seconds so that's the float
drop<00:03:01.689> one<00:03:02.109> thing<00:03:02.319> I<00:03:02.409> forgot<00:03:02.439> to<00:03:02.769> mention<00:03:02.920> when

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
drop one thing I forgot to mention when

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.699 
drop one thing I forgot to mention when
you're<00:03:03.909> setting<00:03:04.209> the<00:03:04.239> float<00:03:04.540> level<00:03:04.749> that<00:03:05.349> line

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
you're setting the float level that line

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.459 
you're setting the float level that line
should<00:03:05.980> be<00:03:06.040> close<00:03:06.519> to<00:03:06.790> parallel<00:03:07.269> to<00:03:07.629> the<00:03:07.810> top

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:08.469 
should be close to parallel to the top

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:11.160 
should be close to parallel to the top
of<00:03:08.620> the<00:03:08.709> air<00:03:08.829> so<00:03:09.430> if<00:03:09.519> it's<00:03:09.670> if<00:03:10.359> it's<00:03:10.540> you<00:03:11.049> know

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
of the air so if it's if it's you know

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.229 
of the air so if it's if it's you know
way<00:03:11.379> one<00:03:12.129> way<00:03:12.280> or<00:03:12.340> the<00:03:12.400> other<00:03:12.459> you<00:03:12.700> need<00:03:12.969> to<00:03:13.090> do

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
way one way or the other you need to do

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:23.200 
way one way or the other you need to do
some<00:03:13.450> more<00:03:13.599> just<00:03:13.930> and<00:03:14.049> you<00:03:14.109> get<00:03:14.290> it<00:03:14.379> right

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:23.210 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:25.270
