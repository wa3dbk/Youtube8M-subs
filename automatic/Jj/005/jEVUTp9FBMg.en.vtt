00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
out working mistake I probably made the

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.340 
out working mistake I probably made the
same<00:01:22.439> thing<00:01:22.679> but<00:01:23.250> um<00:01:23.659> he<00:01:24.659> goes<00:01:24.780> into<00:01:24.960> chuckle

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.620 
I'm not really sure why so I just was
combat<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:29.460> because<00:01:30.090> i<00:01:30.149> know<00:01:30.210> i'm<00:01:30.359> gonna<00:01:30.450> do<00:01:30.600> a

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
combat it because i know i'm gonna do a

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.149 
combat it because i know i'm gonna do a
lot<00:01:30.780> of<00:01:30.810> damn<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.140> after<00:01:31.409> swords<00:01:31.679> dance<00:01:31.859> even

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
lot of damn it after swords dance even

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.389 
lot of damn it after swords dance even
with<00:01:32.399> godlike<00:01:32.909> defenses<00:01:33.590> and<00:01:34.590> it<00:01:34.770> protects<00:01:35.130> me

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:35.399 
with godlike defenses and it protects me

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:37.760 
with godlike defenses and it protects me
i<00:01:35.429> guess<00:01:35.729> being<00:01:36.329> he<00:01:36.390> gains<00:01:36.570> enough<00:01:36.780> ATP<00:01:37.109> back<00:01:37.499> I

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
i guess being he gains enough ATP back I

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.550 
i guess being he gains enough ATP back I
don't<00:01:38.070> only<00:01:38.159> know<00:01:38.340> why<00:01:38.460> he's<00:01:38.609> protecting<00:01:39.090> here

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
don't only know why he's protecting here

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.569 
don't only know why he's protecting here
guess<00:01:40.560> because<00:01:40.740> he's<00:01:40.890> nothing<00:01:41.130> better<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.460> do

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
guess because he's nothing better to do

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.950 
guess because he's nothing better to do
but<00:01:42.740> I'm<00:01:43.740> he<00:01:43.829> got<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.069> stuff<00:01:44.249> walk<00:01:44.490> up<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:45.060> now

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
but I'm he got the stuff walk up and now

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.419 
but I'm he got the stuff walk up and now
he<00:01:46.020> sends<00:01:46.350> out<00:01:46.469> what<00:01:46.649> he<00:01:46.740> probably<00:01:47.130> should

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:47.429 
he sends out what he probably should

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:49.340 
he sends out what he probably should
have<00:01:47.490> sent<00:01:47.670> out<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:47.880> begin<00:01:48.210> with<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:49.229> that's

going to switch out
and<00:02:10.689> he<00:02:10.840> does<00:02:10.989> and<00:02:11.230> he<00:02:11.290> goes<00:02:11.470> into<00:02:11.939> roserade

00:02:12.929 --> 00:02:12.939 
and he does and he goes into roserade

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:18.569 
and he does and he goes into roserade
here<00:02:13.510> as<00:02:13.989> I<00:02:14.140> dragon<00:02:14.590> dance<00:02:16.379> and<00:02:17.379> I<00:02:18.010> decided<00:02:18.280> on

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:18.579 
here as I dragon dance and I decided on

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:20.789 
here as I dragon dance and I decided on
it<00:02:18.700> so<00:02:18.879> I<00:02:18.909> can't<00:02:19.209> sleep<00:02:19.480> powder<00:02:19.780> or<00:02:20.409> except

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:20.799 
it so I can't sleep powder or except

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:23.399 
it so I can't sleep powder or except
some<00:02:20.950> toxic<00:02:21.400> spikes<00:02:21.700> or<00:02:22.000> whatever<00:02:22.569> else<00:02:23.140> for

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:23.409 
some toxic spikes or whatever else for

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:27.869 
some toxic spikes or whatever else for
his<00:02:23.530> raid<00:02:23.680> likes<00:02:23.920> to<00:02:24.069> do<00:02:24.599> and<00:02:26.069> I<00:02:27.069> probably

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:27.879 
his raid likes to do and I probably

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:29.550 
his raid likes to do and I probably
should<00:02:28.090> switch<00:02:28.329> doubt<00:02:28.540> but<00:02:28.870> it<00:02:29.110> doesn't

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
should switch doubt but it doesn't

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.610 
should switch doubt but it doesn't
change<00:02:29.620> the<00:02:29.860> fact<00:02:30.099> that<00:02:30.190> I<00:02:30.280> got<00:02:30.459> hacked<00:02:31.620> my

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
change the fact that I got hacked my

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.050 
change the fact that I got hacked my
missus<00:02:32.890> don't<00:02:33.099> edge<00:02:33.250> and<00:02:33.459> I<00:02:33.489> mr.<00:02:33.730> stone<00:02:33.970> age

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
missus don't edge and I mr. stone age

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.530 
missus don't edge and I mr. stone age
again<00:02:35.040> Mike<00:02:36.040> Stone<00:02:36.280> Edge<00:02:36.459> seriously<00:02:37.329> that's

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
again Mike Stone Edge seriously that's

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.229 
again Mike Stone Edge seriously that's
okay<00:02:38.370> so<00:02:39.370> i<00:02:39.400> probably<00:02:39.849> should<00:02:40.090> have<00:02:40.150> switched

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
okay so i probably should have switched

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:42.839 
okay so i probably should have switched

this<00:02:43.230> grass<00:02:44.230> moves<00:02:44.590> I<00:02:45.000> guess<00:02:46.000> I<00:02:46.060> wasn't

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
this grass moves I guess I wasn't

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:47.879 
this grass moves I guess I wasn't
thinking<00:02:46.359> straight<00:02:46.690> I<00:02:47.049> think<00:02:47.650> I<00:02:47.709> actually

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:47.889 
thinking straight I think I actually

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:50.670 
thinking straight I think I actually
forgot<00:02:48.159> he<00:02:48.519> was<00:02:48.549> alive<00:02:49.060> when<00:02:49.780> I<00:02:49.930> was<00:02:50.139> doing

forgot he was alive when I was doing

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.250 
forgot he was alive when I was doing
that<00:02:50.709> they<00:02:51.400> see<00:02:52.090> I<00:02:52.120> I'm<00:02:52.900> just<00:02:53.079> full<00:02:53.230> of

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
that they see I I'm just full of

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.240 
that they see I I'm just full of
mistakes<00:02:54.090> because<00:02:55.090> I'm<00:02:55.420> so<00:02:55.569> rusty<00:02:55.859> but<00:02:56.859> I<00:02:56.889> do

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
mistakes because I'm so rusty but I do

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.550 
mistakes because I'm so rusty but I do
take<00:02:57.549> down<00:02:57.760> red<00:02:58.540> now<00:02:58.810> he's<00:02:58.959> end<00:02:59.109> up<00:02:59.200> this<00:02:59.349> guy

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
take down red now he's end up this guy

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.869 
take down red now he's end up this guy
and<00:02:59.889> I'm<00:02:59.980> just<00:03:00.159> checking<00:03:00.400> to<00:03:00.549> see<00:03:00.670> if<00:03:00.700> I'm

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:00.879 
and I'm just checking to see if I'm

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:02.970 
and I'm just checking to see if I'm
faster<00:03:01.299> doesn't<00:03:01.510> even<00:03:01.810> know<00:03:01.959> anymore<00:03:02.170> and<00:03:02.590> i

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
faster doesn't even know anymore and i

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.830 
faster doesn't even know anymore and i
discovered<00:03:03.250> that<00:03:03.400> i'm<00:03:03.579> probably<00:03:03.849> not<00:03:04.060> jolly

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
discovered that i'm probably not jolly

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.780 
discovered that i'm probably not jolly
so<00:03:05.170> i<00:03:05.230> decided<00:03:05.650> to<00:03:05.799> do<00:03:05.920> a<00:03:05.950> bit<00:03:06.190> into<00:03:06.459> Celebi

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
so i decided to do a bit into Celebi

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.660 
so i decided to do a bit into Celebi
people<00:03:07.569> took<00:03:07.659> that<00:03:07.870> and<00:03:08.019> uses<00:03:08.319> a<00:03:08.349> ice<00:03:08.859> beam<00:03:09.250> so

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
people took that and uses a ice beam so

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.470 
people took that and uses a ice beam so
it's<00:03:09.849> a<00:03:10.030> mixed<00:03:10.569> weavile<00:03:11.139> or<00:03:11.590> he<00:03:12.060> never<00:03:13.060> got<00:03:13.359> it

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
it's a mixed weavile or he never got it

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.849 
it's a mixed weavile or he never got it

know that all he has to hurt me is
always<00:03:23.530> punch<00:03:23.859> I<00:03:24.190> mean<00:03:24.400> he<00:03:24.459> could<00:03:24.579> use<00:03:24.730> night

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.580 
always punch I mean he could use night
slash<00:03:25.000> but<00:03:25.540> I<00:03:25.599> don't<00:03:25.750> know<00:03:25.840> if<00:03:25.930> he<00:03:26.019> has<00:03:26.230> it<00:03:26.260> I

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
slash but I don't know if he has it I

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.309 
slash but I don't know if he has it I
really<00:03:27.250> don't<00:03:27.430> know<00:03:27.459> the<00:03:27.730> move<00:03:28.419> for<00:03:28.599> this<00:03:28.690> be

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319 
really don't know the move for this be

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:31.589 
really don't know the move for this be
vile<00:03:29.560> so<00:03:30.459> I<00:03:30.489> guess<00:03:30.579> doesn't<00:03:31.000> mix<00:03:31.150> be<00:03:31.389> vile

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:31.599 
vile so I guess doesn't mix be vile

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:33.900 
vile so I guess doesn't mix be vile
which<00:03:31.780> is<00:03:31.900> just<00:03:32.079> weird<00:03:32.319> he<00:03:33.220> soars<00:03:33.430> dancer<00:03:33.760> than

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
which is just weird he soars dancer than

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.240 
which is just weird he soars dancer than
ice<00:03:34.090> beams<00:03:34.359> again<00:03:34.690> I<00:03:34.959> don't<00:03:35.680> know<00:03:35.799> why<00:03:35.949> you<00:03:36.010> did

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
ice beams again I don't know why you did

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.729 
ice beams again I don't know why you did
that<00:03:36.280> but<00:03:37.060> I<00:03:37.120> used<00:03:37.690> lychee<00:03:38.139> to<00:03:38.290> finish<00:03:38.500> it<00:03:38.620> off

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
that but I used lychee to finish it off

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:40.740 
that but I used lychee to finish it off
since<00:03:39.160> lychee<00:03:39.790> can<00:03:40.000> do<00:03:40.150> that<00:03:40.329> at<00:03:40.449> one<00:03:40.599> hit

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
since lychee can do that at one hit

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:46.800 
since lychee can do that at one hit
point<00:03:42.449> so<00:03:43.449> now<00:03:43.989> he<00:03:44.049> goes<00:03:44.199> into<00:03:44.260> Charizard<00:03:45.780> so<00:03:46.780> I

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
point so now he goes into Charizard so I

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.229 
point so now he goes into Charizard so I
go<00:03:47.049> into<00:03:47.260> heatran<00:03:48.160> expecting<00:03:48.669> a<00:03:48.730> fire<00:03:48.940> move

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
go into heatran expecting a fire move

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:53.460 
go into heatran expecting a fire move

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
and to use the fire move and it's

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.500 
and to use the fire move and it's
actually<00:03:53.560> she's<00:03:54.040> jars<00:03:54.609> are<00:03:54.760> just<00:03:54.940> toy<00:03:55.090> scarf
