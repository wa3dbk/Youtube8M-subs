00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.359
 all right 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.730
 do not 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.730
 late 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.300
 good girls in today's video os 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.920
 I bring something that I thought was very 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.020
 interesting and that I think a lot of people 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.540
 you do not know and inside what should 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.750
 know and it 's the lead content in 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.400
 the labials 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.580
 and I found out a month ago 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.480
 about this topic but I think 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:39.360
 who has already been talking 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.360
 of this already long ago 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:45.410
 good what happens with lead the lead 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:48.290
 it is a substance that our organism 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:51.950
 does not metabolize therefore remains in 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:55.490
 our body for a very long time 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:57.680
 So what causes lead because short 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:00.140
 term can leave us subject in the 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.590
 lips which I think seems to me something 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.760
 positive because because if you do not know this 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.270
 bad on the lips because we will leave 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:11.540
 use in the long-term way 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:16.040
 4 look for cancer we can get spots 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:18.350
 grayish on the skin can cause 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:22.010
 spontaneous abortions and infertility 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:24.560
 this fix everything what what we 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:27.150
 can produce the little joke of this 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:31.200
 so I think it seems to me 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:34.680
 that we should spread it and say it to 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.420
 everybody because I think we do not know 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.590
 that we are not aware of what 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.840
 we are using and what is not 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.850
 we use good as I also now 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.880
 I'm going to tell you one thing a very 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.770
 simple how to detect when 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.960
 lipsticks have lead or not simply 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.810
 we need a very golden ring 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.370
 important that it be gold and lipsticks 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.370
 that we want 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.659
 and girls for 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.619
 the rest what we need is 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.619
 with rings 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.969
 and no one 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:16.099
 I want to start with this winnie paris 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:24.160
 and good he 348 a superb jealousy 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.160
 in 348 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.420
 our bits 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.900
 it can not be prevented 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:36.240
 better in this expense is this 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.240
 rhythm and the 166 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.709
 as you see premiere 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:25.599
 at the level 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.680
 well guys you see, I think it's something 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.140
 super simple to detect to be at 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.660
 reach of all power to be able to give us 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:38.570
 account and you can detect it and I would like 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.400
 that when what it's worth is that you put 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.560
 down in the comments 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.360
 which have tested positive and that's why 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:48.539
 given they have given us negative 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.439
 because that way we can help each other 

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:52.340
 and another 

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:55.510
 the girls many kisses 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.510
