00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:06.980 

lots<00:00:05.549> of<00:00:05.730> people<00:00:06.089> are<00:00:06.240> talking<00:00:06.420> about<00:00:06.690> the

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
lots of people are talking about the

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.470 
lots of people are talking about the
Volt<00:00:07.200> and<00:00:07.440> how<00:00:08.010> it<00:00:08.130> works<00:00:09.200> so<00:00:10.200> what<00:00:10.590> is<00:00:10.679> it

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:11.480 
Volt and how it works so what is it

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.509 
Volt and how it works so what is it
that's<00:00:12.480> a<00:00:12.690> good<00:00:12.840> question<00:00:13.380> because<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:14.280> Volt

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
that's a good question because the Volt

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.880 
that's a good question because the Volt
is<00:00:14.700> unlike<00:00:15.089> any<00:00:15.330> other<00:00:15.570> car<00:00:15.870> ever<00:00:16.139> produced

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
is unlike any other car ever produced

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.220 
is unlike any other car ever produced
we<00:00:17.730> know<00:00:17.910> you<00:00:17.970> want<00:00:18.359> more<00:00:18.539> freedom<00:00:18.840> from<00:00:19.140> the

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
we know you want more freedom from the

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.200 
we know you want more freedom from the
pump<00:00:19.439> and<00:00:19.710> from<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.250> charging<00:00:20.640> station<00:00:21.029> and

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
pump and from the charging station and

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.400 
pump and from the charging station and
that's<00:00:21.930> why<00:00:22.199> we<00:00:22.350> built<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.710> Volt<00:00:24.080> so<00:00:25.080> let's

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
that's why we built the Volt so let's

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.080 
that's why we built the Volt so let's
explain<00:00:25.830> how<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.160> Volt<00:00:26.400> is<00:00:26.519> different<00:00:26.910> from

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
explain how the Volt is different from

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.650 
explain how the Volt is different from
other<00:00:27.240> cars<00:00:27.480> on<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.750> road<00:00:29.090> is<00:00:30.090> it<00:00:30.240> electric

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
other cars on the road is it electric

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.620 
other cars on the road is it electric
yes<00:00:31.289> it<00:00:31.560> runs<00:00:31.859> on<00:00:32.070> electricity<00:00:32.510> charging<00:00:33.510> with

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
yes it runs on electricity charging with

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.299 
yes it runs on electricity charging with
a<00:00:33.660> regular<00:00:34.079> household<00:00:34.500> outlet<00:00:34.860> takes<00:00:35.160> about

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
a regular household outlet takes about

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.930 
a regular household outlet takes about
10<00:00:35.670> hours<00:00:36.079> with<00:00:37.079> an<00:00:37.200> available<00:00:37.520> 240<00:00:38.520> volt<00:00:38.700> home

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
10 hours with an available 240 volt home

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.119 
10 hours with an available 240 volt home
charging<00:00:39.239> station<00:00:39.809> it's<00:00:40.050> about<00:00:40.320> 4<00:00:40.590> hours<00:00:40.920> a

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
charging station it's about 4 hours a

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.000 
charging station it's about 4 hours a
full<00:00:41.790> charge<00:00:42.059> gives<00:00:42.480> you<00:00:42.600> about<00:00:42.780> 35<00:00:43.410> miles<00:00:43.710> of

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
full charge gives you about 35 miles of

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.790 
full charge gives you about 35 miles of
tailpipe<00:00:44.610> emissions<00:00:45.210> free<00:00:45.480> driving<00:00:45.800> that

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
tailpipe emissions free driving that

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.319 
tailpipe emissions free driving that
means<00:00:47.070> many<00:00:47.370> of<00:00:47.520> you<00:00:47.610> can<00:00:47.820> complete<00:00:48.180> your

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
means many of you can complete your

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.090 
means many of you can complete your
daily<00:00:48.629> commute<00:00:48.960> without<00:00:49.200> using<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:49.800> drop<00:00:50.070> of

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
daily commute without using a drop of

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.450 
daily commute without using a drop of
gas<00:00:50.489> you<00:00:51.360> can't<00:00:51.600> do<00:00:51.750> that<00:00:51.930> in<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.170> hybrid<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.860> if

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
gas you can't do that in a hybrid and if

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.549 
gas you can't do that in a hybrid and if
the<00:00:53.579> Volt<00:00:53.760> electric<00:00:54.210> range<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.600> used<00:00:54.780> up<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:55.199> gas

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
the Volt electric range is used up a gas

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.470 
the Volt electric range is used up a gas
generator<00:00:55.860> works<00:00:56.489> with<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.789> electric<00:00:57.180> motors

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
generator works with the electric motors

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.479 
generator works with the electric motors
to<00:00:57.510> keep<00:00:57.870> you<00:00:57.960> going<00:00:58.140> so<00:00:58.859> if<00:00:59.160> you're<00:00:59.309> driving

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
to keep you going so if you're driving

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.910 
to keep you going so if you're driving
across<00:00:59.850> town<00:01:00.210> or<00:01:00.510> across<00:01:00.600> country<00:01:01.500> you<00:01:01.739> have

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
across town or across country you have

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.700 
across town or across country you have
the<00:01:02.039> freedom<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.579> drive<00:01:02.820> anywhere<00:01:03.629> even<00:01:04.619> if

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
the freedom to drive anywhere even if

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.980 
the freedom to drive anywhere even if
you<00:01:04.799> can't<00:01:05.040> recharge<00:01:05.430> just<00:01:06.119> fill<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:06.659> up<00:01:06.720> like

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
you can't recharge just fill it up like

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.929 
you can't recharge just fill it up like
you<00:01:07.140> do<00:01:07.260> with<00:01:07.409> your<00:01:07.560> car<00:01:07.740> now<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.549> can't<00:01:08.790> do

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
you do with your car now you can't do

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.820 
you do with your car now you can't do
that<00:01:09.119> in<00:01:09.270> any<00:01:09.390> other<00:01:09.510> electric<00:01:10.110> car<00:01:10.290> which

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
that in any other electric car which

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.000 
that in any other electric car which
means<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.369> Volt<00:01:11.610> can<00:01:12.000> be<00:01:12.150> your<00:01:12.360> only<00:01:12.630> car<00:01:13.010> but

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
means the Volt can be your only car but

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.830 
means the Volt can be your only car but
the<00:01:14.130> Volt<00:01:14.340> isn't<00:01:14.640> just<00:01:14.880> about<00:01:15.030> technology

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
the Volt isn't just about technology

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.429 
the Volt isn't just about technology
it's<00:01:16.409> also<00:01:16.619> really<00:01:17.189> fun<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.700> drive<00:01:18.439> instant

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
it's also really fun to drive instant

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.969 
it's also really fun to drive instant

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
it's electric sure but it's so much more

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:49.190 
it's electric sure but it's so much more
it'll<00:01:48.119> change<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.600> way<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:48.869> feel<00:01:49.170> about
