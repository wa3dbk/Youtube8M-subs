00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:15.690
 hi friends today we are going to learn to play 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:17.849
 play you like the idea, let's go to it 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.349
 in this video I'll show you how 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:22.470
 play the one in two different ways 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:24.990
 first in an easy way using 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.210
 open capo and chords and then the 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.640
 we'll see as it sounds in the song without 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.500
 capo and with fifth chords 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.050
 nothing first let's start with the mode 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.170
 easy for this we have to place a 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.580
 nut here on the number one fret if 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.680
 you do not have I leave you here below a 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.079
 link where I show you how to make the 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.190
 and the first thing we're going to learn is the 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.190
 intro that sounds like this 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.660
 and well there he uses only four 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.430
 chords the first one is this a greater fa 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.830
 seventh 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.410
 we will place it leaving the first string to the 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:07.200
 second air pressed in fret one with 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:09.900
 index third string in fret two with 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.610
 middle finger and fourth string in fret 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.790
 three with ring finger 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:18.130
 fa seventh best friends the next one goes 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.860
 to be a minor seventh than from here 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.840
 we just raise the middle finger and 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.200
 we put it in fret 2 of the fourth 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.200
 rope 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:31.270
 the lower seventh the next one is going to be 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:33.729
 a seventh less re that we put the 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.340
 Heart finger in fret 2 of the third 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:38.740
 string and with index finger we press to the 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.610
 once making a little seed in fret 1 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.620
 first and second rope 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.990
 and the fourth and last I agreed well 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.030
 this greater than you already know it from 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.220
 surplus 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.780
 and we already have the chords now we're going to 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.780
 see the rhythm he does if he looks 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.120
 let's see it slowly let's start 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:08.930
 giving we put in the accord of F major 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:11.090
 seventh and we go downstairs and now 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:12.770
 we cover the strings 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.400
 ropes twisting the wrist a little 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.400
 this part of here 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:22.660
 and now I'm up and tap another 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.340
 once the strings and now I lower and give a 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.560
 blow alone is not to say is by the 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.370
 strings but at the same time I give a little 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.909
 with the barb it is worth 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.909
 never 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:37.170
 here it is 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.890
 is 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.450
 Well then, let's go slowly 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.410
 know how we are doing the 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:54.730
 3 whole progression 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.730
 yes no 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.900
 all right 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.409
 what 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.409
 here 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.510
 faster 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.660
 all right 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.380
 p 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.850
 my life 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.330
 and you are friends we already have what is the 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.680
 rhythm is a matter of you going 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.680
 giving little by little speed 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.430
 good 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:42.380
 palin 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.510
 and well, at this point I have to 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.210
 give you good news that is that 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.670
 we have the complete subject because always 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:51.620
 the same order of chords is repeated and the 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.720
 same rhythm and if you will not see it clearly in the 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.910
 video show now let's play 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.590
 a little together so you can see how 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.940
 I'm really telling you the truth 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.570
 Let's go there 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.570
 all right 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:10.140
 yes 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.530
 nothing 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.989
 good friends if we already have the subject 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.430
 learned in easy mode now let's 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.639
 see it as it sounds in the song 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:27.540
 original for it we will remove the capo 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:27.540
 and see how it sounds 

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:37.699
 note that the rhythm is the same as 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.380
 more important is exactly the same 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:42.750
 they just change the chords we're going to 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:45.360
 start putting a fifth sharp fa 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:50.069
 that is put with index in fret two of 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:54.380
 the sixth annular cord and little finger in 

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:56.330
 fret four of fifth and fourth string 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:05:00.080
 then these first three should not 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:03.849
 sound then we will move to a the 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:06.939
 sharp that is with fret index 6 

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:10.330
 after a sustained prayer that is in 

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:13.869
 fret 11 and after do sharp that is 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.529
 in fret 9 and the rhythm is the same as 

00:05:13.869 --> 00:05:17.490
 before 

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:17.490
 look slowly 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:23.300
 d 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.300
 where 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:38.090
 and good friends we already have the tutorial of 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:39.889
 this complete song if you want to play it 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:41.930
 together with a friend as one can do 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:43.940
 the advice mode and another one with 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:46.400
 fifths chords I leave the video 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:49.870
