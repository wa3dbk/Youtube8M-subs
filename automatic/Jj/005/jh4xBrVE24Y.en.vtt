00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 Hi 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 Opened a new barber shop 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 Open the key every morning 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 Check the water and electricity in the evening and shut the key every day 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 5 years 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 With 10 years 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 Hard key is hard, does not open 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 Finally open 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 Also check the key here and there in the evening ... I do not close, I do not move 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 But somehow I was locked 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 What happened to the broken key? 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 Try to oil 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 I contacted the key company and had the service person come 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 If you confirm the key 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 Ten years ago the key irregularities were clear 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 Now the convex mountains are worn down 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 So it's hard to open 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 If you ask me to remake it with the explanation "You only need to renew the key" 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 I wonder if the keys move smoothly 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 This is the same as my home key 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 After 10 years it will wear out 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 "What? You should call the bell and enter with your own key." 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 "Well, I can't use the wrong key." 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 Oh, it may be the same as the explanation of the previous serviceman 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 Let's make it anyway 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 How can I use it smoothly when inserting a new key 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 After all, unevenness used for many years and decreased 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 If everyone is using it for more than 10 years and the key becomes difficult to move 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 I would like to ask a key shop 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 goodbye
