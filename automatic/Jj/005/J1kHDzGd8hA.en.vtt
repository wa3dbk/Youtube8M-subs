my 1979 300 s D as an example and
there's<00:00:24.660> one<00:00:24.960> thing<00:00:25.170> I<00:00:25.289> forgot<00:00:25.470> to<00:00:25.680> talk<00:00:26.010> to

don't think I've done a video on this to

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.240 
don't think I've done a video on this to
date<00:00:29.630> but<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:30.779> needs<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.349> be<00:00:31.470> mentioned<00:00:31.800> and

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
they'll put in a new filter cartridge

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.500 
they'll put in a new filter cartridge
and<00:00:58.170> they'll<00:00:58.440> just<00:00:58.469> put<00:00:59.370> this<00:00:59.520> back<00:00:59.820> down<00:01:00.210> in

and they'll just put this back down in

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.770 
and they'll just put this back down in
there<00:01:00.690> with<00:01:00.899> no<00:01:01.410> regard<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:02.340> these<00:01:03.000> two<00:01:03.359> little

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
there with no regard to these two little

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.250 
there with no regard to these two little
o-rings<00:01:04.309> now<00:01:05.309> what<00:01:06.000> do<00:01:06.180> these<00:01:06.330> o-rings<00:01:06.600> do

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
o-rings now what do these o-rings do

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.450 
o-rings now what do these o-rings do
first<00:01:08.130> off<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.670> secondly<00:01:09.860> what<00:01:10.860> how<00:01:11.280> do<00:01:11.340> you

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
first off and secondly what how do you

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.149 
first off and secondly what how do you
how<00:01:11.729> can<00:01:11.760> you<00:01:11.939> tell<00:01:12.270> if<00:01:12.420> they're<00:01:12.570> bad<00:01:13.100> so<00:01:14.100> I

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
how can you tell if they're bad so I

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.469 
how can you tell if they're bad so I
want<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.369> show<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:14.610> this<00:01:14.700> up<00:01:14.760> close<00:01:15.119> so<00:01:15.450> you

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
want to show you this up close so you

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.249 
want to show you this up close so you
can<00:01:15.750> see<00:01:16.110> we've<00:01:16.290> got<00:01:16.439> an<00:01:16.619> example<00:01:17.100> here<00:01:17.610> of<00:01:17.640> a

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
can see we've got an example here of a

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:21.350 
can see we've got an example here of a
oil<00:01:19.259> filter<00:01:19.710> housing<00:01:19.740> cap<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.670> was<00:01:20.850> removed

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
oil filter housing cap that was removed

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.510 
oil filter housing cap that was removed
and<00:01:21.659> I<00:01:21.780> saved<00:01:22.320> it<00:01:22.560> because<00:01:22.799> I<00:01:22.830> wanted<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.369> use

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
and I saved it because I wanted to use

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.870 
and I saved it because I wanted to use
this<00:01:23.670> an<00:01:23.880> example<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.479> you<00:01:24.509> can<00:01:24.600> see<00:01:25.880> the

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
this an example and you can see the

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.090 
this an example and you can see the
condition<00:01:27.479> of<00:01:27.720> these<00:01:28.080> particular<00:01:28.680> rings<00:01:28.950> I

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
condition of these particular rings I

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.429 
condition of these particular rings I
expect<00:01:30.060> they've<00:01:30.240> been<00:01:30.450> on<00:01:30.570> this<00:01:30.780> chef<00:01:31.079> for

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
expect they've been on this chef for

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.630 
expect they've been on this chef for
years<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.280> years<00:01:32.790> so<00:01:33.570> let's<00:01:34.140> take<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.350> look<00:01:34.640> you

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
years and years so let's take a look you

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.190 
years and years so let's take a look you
can<00:01:35.790> see<00:01:36.000> that<00:01:36.210> these<00:01:36.329> two<00:01:36.390> o-rings<00:01:36.780> are

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
can see that these two o-rings are

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.080 
can see that these two o-rings are
located<00:01:37.680> right<00:01:37.710> on<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.400> end<00:01:38.640> of<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.850> shaft

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
located right on the end of the shaft

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.499 
located right on the end of the shaft
they're<00:01:39.869> intended<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.500> keep<00:01:40.890> oil<00:01:41.159> in<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:42.479> oil

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
they're intended to keep oil in the oil

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.660 
they're intended to keep oil in the oil
filter<00:01:43.020> housing<00:01:43.140> so<00:01:43.860> when<00:01:44.009> you<00:01:44.100> start<00:01:44.430> up<00:01:44.549> your

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
filter housing so when you start up your

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.399 
filter housing so when you start up your
engine<00:01:45.030> there's<00:01:45.210> oil<00:01:45.450> there<00:01:45.810> you're<00:01:46.079> going<00:01:46.290> to

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
engine there's oil there you're going to

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.620 
engine there's oil there you're going to
get<00:01:46.619> rapid<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.460> almost<00:01:47.729> immediate<00:01:48.210> engine

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
get rapid and almost immediate engine

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.170 
get rapid and almost immediate engine
oil<00:01:48.869> pressure<00:01:48.920> so<00:01:49.920> if<00:01:50.159> these<00:01:50.369> o-rings<00:01:50.640> are<00:01:51.030> bad

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
oil pressure so if these o-rings are bad

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.270 
oil pressure so if these o-rings are bad
it's<00:01:51.540> going<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:51.869> allow<00:01:52.079> all<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.619> oil<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:53.040> drain

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
it's going to allow all the oil to drain

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.920 
it's going to allow all the oil to drain
out<00:01:53.579> of<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.820> housing<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.479> when<00:01:54.570> you<00:01:54.630> start

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
out of the housing and when you start

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.289 
out of the housing and when you start
your<00:01:55.079> engine<00:01:55.439> you<00:01:55.950> may<00:01:56.219> notice<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.759> long<00:01:57.000> delay

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
your engine you may notice a long delay

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.510 
your engine you may notice a long delay
in<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:58.049> oil<00:01:58.200> pressure<00:01:58.590> coming<00:01:59.009> up<00:01:59.159> so<00:01:59.340> that's

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
in the oil pressure coming up so that's

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.670 
in the oil pressure coming up so that's
a<00:01:59.700> sign<00:01:59.939> that<00:01:59.969> you<00:02:00.509> may<00:02:00.689> have<00:02:00.869> bad<00:02:01.170> ol<00:02:01.439> rings

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
a sign that you may have bad ol rings

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.459 
a sign that you may have bad ol rings
there<00:02:01.860> but<00:02:02.399> take<00:02:02.579> a<00:02:02.640> look<00:02:02.850> at<00:02:02.969> these<00:02:03.149> o-rings

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:03.469 
there but take a look at these o-rings

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:06.800 
there but take a look at these o-rings
they're<00:02:04.469> not<00:02:04.680> round<00:02:04.920> notice<00:02:05.430> that<00:02:05.810> they're

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
they're not round notice that they're

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.270 
they're not round notice that they're
square<00:02:07.170> and<00:02:07.619> they're<00:02:08.489> very<00:02:08.910> very<00:02:09.300> hard<00:02:10.280> so

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
square and they're very very hard so

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.059 
square and they're very very hard so
that's<00:02:11.370> why<00:02:11.670> I<00:02:11.700> think<00:02:11.910> these<00:02:12.180> are<00:02:12.239> probably

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
that's why I think these are probably

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:14.589 
that's why I think these are probably
in<00:02:13.189> four<00:02:13.489> years<00:02:13.519> so<00:02:13.999> I'm<00:02:14.090> gonna<00:02:14.180> take<00:02:14.420> this

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599 
in four years so I'm gonna take this

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:16.479 
in four years so I'm gonna take this
little<00:02:14.840> pick<00:02:15.109> tool<00:02:15.409> here<00:02:15.709> let's<00:02:15.950> see<00:02:16.129> just<00:02:16.370> how

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
little pick tool here let's see just how

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.629 
little pick tool here let's see just how
hard<00:02:16.909> these<00:02:17.120> are<00:02:17.420> and<00:02:18.249> when<00:02:19.249> they're<00:02:19.400> real

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:19.639 
hard these are and when they're real

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:22.929 
hard these are and when they're real
hard<00:02:19.879> like<00:02:20.150> this<00:02:20.769> they<00:02:21.769> will<00:02:22.040> not<00:02:22.280> even

00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:22.939 
hard like this they will not even

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:28.750 
hard like this they will not even
stretch<00:02:24.370> in<00:02:25.370> fact<00:02:26.889> they<00:02:27.889> can<00:02:28.069> be<00:02:28.099> a<00:02:28.280> pain<00:02:28.700> to

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
stretch in fact they can be a pain to

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.819 
stretch in fact they can be a pain to
get<00:02:29.090> off<00:02:29.299> see<00:02:29.599> that<00:02:29.780> I'm<00:02:30.019> not<00:02:30.049> even<00:02:30.260> able<00:02:30.620> to

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:30.829 
get off see that I'm not even able to

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:34.240 
get off see that I'm not even able to
get<00:02:30.980> under<00:02:31.250> the<00:02:31.340> o-ring<00:02:31.639> look<00:02:31.790> at<00:02:31.879> that<00:02:33.250> you

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
get under the o-ring look at that you

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.690 
get under the o-ring look at that you
can<00:02:34.310> see<00:02:35.560> that<00:02:36.560> the<00:02:36.709> only<00:02:36.889> way<00:02:37.250> to<00:02:37.280> get<00:02:37.549> that

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
can see that the only way to get that

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.129 
can see that the only way to get that
o-ring<00:02:37.879> off<00:02:38.950> is<00:02:39.950> to<00:02:40.250> break<00:02:40.519> it<00:02:40.730> and<00:02:41.389> if<00:02:42.049> you

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:42.139 
o-ring off is to break it and if you

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:43.869 
o-ring off is to break it and if you
compare<00:02:42.560> it<00:02:42.680> with<00:02:42.709> a<00:02:42.859> new<00:02:43.099> o-ring<00:02:43.249> look<00:02:43.669> at<00:02:43.790> the

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:43.879 
compare it with a new o-ring look at the

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:46.209 
compare it with a new o-ring look at the
difference<00:02:44.209> you<00:02:44.450> can<00:02:44.810> see<00:02:44.840> this<00:02:45.590> o-ring<00:02:46.069> is

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:46.219 
difference you can see this o-ring is

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:48.250 
difference you can see this o-ring is
flattened<00:02:46.669> out<00:02:46.760> that<00:02:47.030> o-ring<00:02:47.209> is<00:02:47.569> nice<00:02:47.840> and

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
flattened out that o-ring is nice and

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.369 
flattened out that o-ring is nice and
soft<00:02:48.829> and<00:02:49.159> round<00:02:49.489> and<00:02:50.090> of<00:02:50.419> course<00:02:50.659> replacing

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:51.379 
soft and round and of course replacing

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:53.050 
soft and round and of course replacing
the<00:02:51.500> overall<00:02:51.949> rings<00:02:52.189> are<00:02:52.340> very<00:02:52.370> simple<00:02:52.939> all

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
the overall rings are very simple all

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.449 
the overall rings are very simple all
you<00:02:53.150> have<00:02:53.269> to<00:02:53.389> do<00:02:53.599> is<00:02:54.290> just<00:02:54.650> push<00:02:55.010> them<00:02:55.159> on<00:02:55.280> over

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
you have to do is just push them on over

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:58.449 
you have to do is just push them on over
the<00:02:55.730> end<00:02:55.939> and<00:02:56.269> roll<00:02:57.199> them<00:02:57.500> right<00:02:57.769> up<00:02:57.949> into<00:02:58.219> the

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
the end and roll them right up into the

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.929 
the end and roll them right up into the
groove<00:02:58.730> now<00:02:59.120> you<00:02:59.599> can<00:02:59.959> tell<00:03:00.519> the<00:03:01.519> difference

00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:01.939 
groove now you can tell the difference

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:03.939 
groove now you can tell the difference
see<00:03:02.299> how<00:03:02.449> this<00:03:02.659> new<00:03:02.959> o-ring<00:03:03.349> is<00:03:03.530> actually

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:03.949 
see how this new o-ring is actually

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:06.159 
see how this new o-ring is actually
sitting<00:03:04.370> out<00:03:04.489> beyond<00:03:04.939> the<00:03:05.359> end<00:03:05.540> of<00:03:05.900> the<00:03:05.989> shaft

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:06.169 
sitting out beyond the end of the shaft

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:08.740 
sitting out beyond the end of the shaft
where<00:03:06.949> the<00:03:07.099> old<00:03:07.250> o-ring<00:03:07.730> is<00:03:07.969> almost<00:03:08.389> flush

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
where the old o-ring is almost flush

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.689 
where the old o-ring is almost flush
with<00:03:09.049> it<00:03:09.230> so<00:03:10.069> you<00:03:10.159> can<00:03:10.609> tell<00:03:10.939> if<00:03:11.239> you<00:03:11.629> pull<00:03:11.989> your

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:12.699 
with it so you can tell if you pull your

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:15.610 
with it so you can tell if you pull your
oil<00:03:13.699> filter<00:03:14.120> housing<00:03:14.150> out<00:03:14.810> you<00:03:15.049> can<00:03:15.230> look<00:03:15.439> at

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
oil filter housing out you can look at

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.949 
oil filter housing out you can look at
these<00:03:16.090> but<00:03:17.090> I<00:03:17.329> kind<00:03:17.689> of<00:03:17.810> remember<00:03:19.449> that<00:03:20.449> you

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
these but I kind of remember that you

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.530 
these but I kind of remember that you
change<00:03:21.319> these<00:03:21.620> on<00:03:22.250> a<00:03:22.370> regular<00:03:22.459> basis<00:03:23.329> and

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
change these on a regular basis and

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.179 
change these on a regular basis and
we'll<00:03:23.840> discuss<00:03:24.199> that<00:03:24.379> a<00:03:24.439> little<00:03:24.530> bit<00:03:24.829> more<00:03:25.069> in

00:03:25.179 --> 00:03:25.189 
we'll discuss that a little bit more in

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:28.449 
we'll discuss that a little bit more in
detail<00:03:25.340> now<00:03:26.019> the<00:03:27.019> new<00:03:27.199> rings<00:03:27.500> are<00:03:27.919> installed

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
detail now the new rings are installed

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:32.409 
detail now the new rings are installed
and<00:03:28.849> this<00:03:29.299> oil<00:03:29.750> filter<00:03:30.049> cap<00:03:30.560> is<00:03:31.209> ready<00:03:32.209> to

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:32.419 
and this oil filter cap is ready to

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:34.030 
and this oil filter cap is ready to
reinstall<00:03:32.659> I<00:03:33.109> would<00:03:33.349> recommend<00:03:33.859> that<00:03:33.949> you

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
reinstall I would recommend that you

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.979 
reinstall I would recommend that you
just<00:03:34.280> put<00:03:34.459> a<00:03:34.489> light<00:03:34.759> coating<00:03:35.150> of<00:03:35.449> engine<00:03:35.870> oil

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
just put a light coating of engine oil

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:37.960 
just put a light coating of engine oil
on<00:03:36.290> these<00:03:36.500> to<00:03:36.680> help<00:03:36.829> them<00:03:37.009> go<00:03:37.189> down<00:03:37.430> in<00:03:37.759> and

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
on these to help them go down in and

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.170 
on these to help them go down in and
seeped<00:03:38.239> into<00:03:38.540> the<00:03:38.780> bottom<00:03:39.139> of<00:03:39.290> the<00:03:39.889> housing

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
seeped into the bottom of the housing

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.509 
seeped into the bottom of the housing
now<00:03:41.180> let's<00:03:41.509> take<00:03:41.720> a<00:03:41.750> look<00:03:42.019> at<00:03:42.470> these<00:03:42.829> these

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
now let's take a look at these these

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:47.199 
now let's take a look at these these
ones<00:03:43.759> I<00:03:44.000> removed<00:03:44.419> here<00:03:44.720> I<00:03:45.370> mentioned<00:03:46.370> that

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
ones I removed here I mentioned that

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:49.420 
ones I removed here I mentioned that
they<00:03:47.419> would<00:03:47.629> get<00:03:47.840> brittle<00:03:48.799> and<00:03:48.949> that's<00:03:49.129> due<00:03:49.400> to

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
they would get brittle and that's due to

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.800 
they would get brittle and that's due to
heat<00:03:50.090> you<00:03:50.989> know<00:03:51.340> over<00:03:52.340> time<00:03:52.579> the<00:03:53.239> heat<00:03:53.509> will

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
heat you know over time the heat will

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.599 
heat you know over time the heat will
affect<00:03:54.259> this<00:03:54.409> rubber<00:03:54.739> and<00:03:55.040> they'll<00:03:55.250> get<00:03:55.459> as

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:55.609 
affect this rubber and they'll get as

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:57.249 
affect this rubber and they'll get as
hard<00:03:55.819> as<00:03:55.939> a<00:03:55.969> rock<00:03:56.030> and<00:03:56.359> if<00:03:56.419> you<00:03:56.509> look<00:03:56.750> here<00:03:56.780> I

00:03:57.249 --> 00:03:57.259 
hard as a rock and if you look here I

00:03:57.259 --> 00:04:01.390 
hard as a rock and if you look here I
can<00:03:57.859> take<00:03:58.099> these<00:03:58.310> and<00:03:58.609> squeeze<00:03:59.540> on<00:03:59.750> them<00:04:00.400> and

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
can take these and squeeze on them and

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.439 
can take these and squeeze on them and
they<00:04:01.790> don't<00:04:01.969> even<00:04:02.060> Bend<00:04:02.479> they<00:04:02.659> just<00:04:04.419> you<00:04:05.419> know

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:05.449 
they don't even Bend they just you know

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:07.780 
they don't even Bend they just you know

break into little pieces here there's no

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.569 
break into little pieces here there's no
flex<00:04:08.180> in<00:04:08.449> this<00:04:08.629> at<00:04:08.870> all

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:09.579 
flex in this at all

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:11.949 
flex in this at all
maybe<00:04:10.579> this<00:04:10.789> one<00:04:10.969> has<00:04:11.120> a<00:04:11.150> little<00:04:11.419> bit<00:04:11.629> of<00:04:11.719> flex

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
maybe this one has a little bit of flex

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:14.740 
maybe this one has a little bit of flex
but<00:04:12.229> you<00:04:12.650> can<00:04:12.799> see<00:04:13.009> they<00:04:13.189> just<00:04:13.430> they<00:04:14.329> just<00:04:14.509> fall

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
but you can see they just they just fall

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.229 
but you can see they just they just fall
apart<00:04:15.109> with<00:04:15.319> a<00:04:15.349> little<00:04:15.680> stress<00:04:15.979> on<00:04:16.190> them<00:04:16.400> so

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
apart with a little stress on them so

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:18.459 
apart with a little stress on them so
it's<00:04:17.449> real<00:04:17.659> important<00:04:18.049> you<00:04:18.109> check<00:04:18.320> these

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:18.469 
it's real important you check these

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:20.080 
it's real important you check these
every<00:04:18.799> time<00:04:18.829> you<00:04:19.039> do<00:04:19.159> an<00:04:19.280> oil<00:04:19.400> change<00:04:19.489> I<00:04:19.909> mean

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
every time you do an oil change I mean

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.269 
every time you do an oil change I mean
if<00:04:20.329> you<00:04:20.750> have<00:04:20.930> a<00:04:20.959> cracked<00:04:21.349> one<00:04:21.560> that<00:04:21.769> that's<00:04:22.130> a

00:04:22.269 --> 00:04:22.279 
if you have a cracked one that that's a

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:25.149 
if you have a cracked one that that's a
real<00:04:22.490> problem<00:04:22.669> so<00:04:23.380> how<00:04:24.380> often<00:04:24.590> should<00:04:24.889> you<00:04:25.039> do

00:04:25.149 --> 00:04:25.159 
real problem so how often should you do

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:26.070 
real problem so how often should you do

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
to the high vibration of these engines

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.269 
to the high vibration of these engines
when<00:05:19.360> you<00:05:19.569> let<00:05:19.779> things<00:05:20.050> rub<00:05:20.440> together<00:05:20.830> on<00:05:21.099> the

when you let things rub together on the

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:24.950 
when you let things rub together on the
engine<00:05:21.490> take<00:05:22.000> a<00:05:22.029> look<00:05:22.360> at<00:05:22.509> this<00:05:22.690> this<00:05:23.500> cap<00:05:23.830> now

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 
engine take a look at this this cap now

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.749 
engine take a look at this this cap now
granted<00:05:25.960> this<00:05:26.289> isn't<00:05:26.710> you<00:05:26.949> know<00:05:27.069> the<00:05:27.189> cap<00:05:27.460> is

00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:27.759 
granted this isn't you know the cap is

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:29.969 
granted this isn't you know the cap is
so<00:05:28.029> thick<00:05:28.300> it's<00:05:28.539> not<00:05:28.689> going<00:05:29.139> to<00:05:29.319> probably<00:05:29.590> wear

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:29.979 
so thick it's not going to probably wear

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:33.450 
so thick it's not going to probably wear
through<00:05:30.279> but<00:05:31.120> can<00:05:31.330> you<00:05:31.449> imagine<00:05:32.129> whoever<00:05:33.129> on

through but can you imagine whoever on
this<00:05:33.639> car<00:05:33.849> they<00:05:34.060> just<00:05:34.090> let<00:05:34.479> their<00:05:34.860> check

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860 
this car they just let their check

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.100 
this car they just let their check
valves<00:05:36.430> and<00:05:36.610> their<00:05:36.729> vacuum<00:05:37.000> lines<00:05:37.449> just<00:05:37.779> lay

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.110 
valves and their vacuum lines just lay

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:41.309 
valves and their vacuum lines just lay
on<00:05:38.319> top<00:05:38.349> the<00:05:38.770> housing<00:05:39.190> in<00:05:39.819> that<00:05:40.029> amazing<00:05:40.319> what

00:05:41.309 --> 00:05:41.319 
on top the housing in that amazing what

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:43.499 
on top the housing in that amazing what
vibration<00:05:42.190> can<00:05:42.430> do<00:05:42.639> to<00:05:42.879> something<00:05:43.210> like<00:05:43.300> this

00:05:43.499 --> 00:05:43.509 
vibration can do to something like this

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:45.300 
vibration can do to something like this
so<00:05:43.960> when<00:05:44.110> you're<00:05:44.229> working<00:05:44.560> around<00:05:44.650> your
