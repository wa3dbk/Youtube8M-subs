people 7 D - 25 so let's get into it
now<00:00:14.969> this<00:00:15.179> particular<00:00:15.590> kid<00:00:16.590> I<00:00:16.710> actually

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
now this particular kid I actually

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.290 
now this particular kid I actually
picked<00:00:17.220> up<00:00:17.369> at<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.869> swap<00:00:18.869> meet<00:00:18.930> so<00:00:19.820> it's<00:00:20.820> a

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
picked up at a swap meet so it's a

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.009 
picked up at a swap meet so it's a
little<00:00:21.420> bit<00:00:21.660> of<00:00:21.810> an<00:00:21.960> older<00:00:22.289> boxing<00:00:22.890> but<00:00:23.369> the

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:24.019 
little bit of an older boxing but the

little bit of an older boxing but the
kit<00:00:25.019> really<00:00:25.170> hasn't<00:00:25.439> changed<00:00:26.010> much<00:00:26.820> a<00:00:27.119> long

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
kit really hasn't changed much a long

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.679 
kit really hasn't changed much a long
while<00:00:28.400> so<00:00:29.400> one<00:00:29.820> of<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:29.970> nice<00:00:30.119> things<00:00:30.179> about

we<00:00:50.489> have<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.820> various<00:00:51.090> clear<00:00:51.629> parts<00:00:51.899> for<00:00:52.140> the

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
we have the various clear parts for the

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.680 
we have the various clear parts for the
kit<00:00:53.120> one<00:00:54.120> important<00:00:54.510> thing<00:00:54.570> note<00:00:54.960> is<00:00:55.199> that<00:00:55.230> the

kit one important thing note is that the
main<00:00:57.690> campy<00:00:58.109> part<00:00:58.350> has<00:00:58.530> no<00:00:59.160> mould<00:00:59.430> line<00:00:59.640> down

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
main campy part has no mould line down

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.819 
main campy part has no mould line down
mell<00:01:00.120> which<00:01:00.359> is<00:01:00.510> very<00:01:00.750> nice<00:01:00.960> which<00:01:01.530> is<00:01:01.680> always

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
details well done moving on to the main

details well done moving on to the main
fuselage<00:01:11.490> halves<00:01:13.220> only<00:01:14.220> major<00:01:14.430> thing<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.909> note

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
fuselage halves only major thing to note

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.010 
fuselage halves only major thing to note
on<00:01:15.420> them<00:01:15.990> is<00:01:16.140> that<00:01:16.259> is<00:01:16.820> the<00:01:17.820> texturing<00:01:18.450> on<00:01:18.659> the

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
on them is that is the texturing on the

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.020 
on them is that is the texturing on the
inside<00:01:19.409> of<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.310> parts<00:01:20.520> I'm<00:01:20.610> not<00:01:20.640> sure<00:01:20.939> if

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
inside of the parts I'm not sure if

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.510 
inside of the parts I'm not sure if
that's<00:01:21.180> accurate<00:01:21.570> or<00:01:21.990> not<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:23.009> could<00:01:23.159> just<00:01:23.340> be

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
that's accurate or not it could just be

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.630 
that's accurate or not it could just be
a<00:01:23.549> bad<00:01:25.100> extruding<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.189> mole

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
a bad extruding the mole

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.640 
a bad extruding the mole
I'm<00:01:26.700> not<00:01:27.290> aren't<00:01:28.290> sure<00:01:29.930> what's<00:01:30.930> another<00:01:31.439> thing

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
I'm not aren't sure what's another thing

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.109 
I'm not aren't sure what's another thing
now<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:31.890> is<00:01:32.009> that<00:01:32.250> all<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.400> ejector<00:01:32.880> pin<00:01:33.090> marks

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
now it is that all the ejector pin marks

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.080 
now it is that all the ejector pin marks
are<00:01:33.630> hidden<00:01:34.590> fortunately<00:01:35.130> on<00:01:35.490> some<00:01:35.939> of<00:01:36.000> these

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
are hidden fortunately on some of these

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.230 
are hidden fortunately on some of these
larger<00:01:36.450> flat<00:01:36.720> pieces<00:01:37.229> so<00:01:37.829> that<00:01:38.400> won't<00:01:38.820> be<00:01:38.970> too

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
larger flat pieces so that won't be too

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.370 
larger flat pieces so that won't be too
much<00:01:39.360> of<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.540> problem<00:01:41.540> why<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.600> kit<00:01:42.990> does<00:01:43.020> give

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
much of a problem why the kit does give

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.130 
much of a problem why the kit does give
you<00:01:43.549> decals<00:01:44.549> for<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.409> instrument<00:01:46.409> panel<00:01:46.470> it

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140

but<00:03:20.450> worst<00:03:21.450> case<00:03:21.690> you<00:03:21.840> can<00:03:21.870> potentially<00:03:22.620> just

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
but worst case you can potentially just

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.300

now<00:03:46.290> we<00:03:47.290> also<00:03:47.440> come<00:03:47.800> Coop's<00:03:48.220> with<00:03:48.970> a<00:03:49.000> couple

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.330 
now we also come Coop's with a couple

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.309 
now we also come Coop's with a couple
poly<00:03:49.569> caps<00:03:49.870> for<00:03:50.230> the<00:03:50.550> propeller<00:03:52.110> which<00:03:53.110> is<00:03:53.290> a

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:53.319 
poly caps for the propeller which is a

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:57.120 
poly caps for the propeller which is a
nice<00:03:53.560> little<00:03:53.590> addition<00:03:54.069> Oh<00:03:56.100> personally<00:03:57.100> I

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
nice little addition Oh personally I

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.229 
nice little addition Oh personally I
think<00:03:57.459> it's<00:03:57.730> a<00:03:57.760> little<00:03:58.090> unnecessary<00:03:58.870> but<00:04:00.239> it's

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
think it's a little unnecessary but it's

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:08.670 
think it's a little unnecessary but it's
there<00:04:01.600> and<00:04:03.959> then<00:04:04.959> what<00:04:05.680> we<00:04:06.280> we<00:04:06.640> have<00:04:07.380> parts<00:04:08.380> for

this is an older boxing decals have
yellowed<00:05:13.240> a<00:05:13.360> little<00:05:13.629> bit<00:05:13.750> which<00:05:13.990> you<00:05:14.169> can<00:05:14.349> in

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
yellowed a little bit which you can in

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.390 
yellowed a little bit which you can in
particular<00:05:15.400> see<00:05:15.729> and<00:05:16.030> the<00:05:16.650> white<00:05:17.650> parts<00:05:18.280> of

00:05:23.809 --> 00:05:23.819 
the decals which is unfortunate but

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:26.369 
the decals which is unfortunate but

00:05:26.369 --> 00:05:26.379 
probably if I leave it in the window let

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:29.089 
probably if I leave it in the window let
get<00:05:26.650> some<00:05:26.860> UV<00:05:27.190> lights<00:05:27.610> that'll<00:05:28.000> break<00:05:28.120> it<00:05:28.300> down

00:05:29.089 --> 00:05:29.099 
get some UV lights that'll break it down

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:34.020 
get some UV lights that'll break it down
