00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.810

 the record the recovery 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.230
 I want to make it clear that the latter 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.000
 section is a purely opinion 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.890
 personal and does not have to be relevant 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.970
 towards your opinion or your future

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.490
 armor that is very pretty we are not leaving 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.320
 to cheat but to me honestly I do not 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:20.030
 finishes convincing this skin with asse 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.610
 maybe with another character I would have been 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.740
 rather better but I do not know I do not see it 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.420
 this armor sticks with the character like this 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.340
 how good is simply an opinion 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.540

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.610
