plug into your mains you get four

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.310 
plug into your mains you get four
batteries<00:01:04.549> which<00:01:05.549> are<00:01:05.720> here<00:01:06.720> I<00:01:06.960> haven't

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
batteries which are here I haven't

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.350 
batteries which are here I haven't
bought<00:01:07.470> unbox<00:01:07.890> them<00:01:08.040> yet<00:01:08.250> because<00:01:08.520> i'll<00:01:08.940> show

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
bought unbox them yet because i'll show

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:17.539 
bought unbox them yet because i'll show
you<00:01:09.420> shortly<00:01:09.810> why<00:01:12.229> slap<00:01:13.229> them<00:01:13.380> in<00:01:13.440> there<00:01:16.549> get

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
you shortly why slap them in there get

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:24.860 
you shortly why slap them in there get
your<00:01:17.580> battery<00:01:20.150> plug<00:01:21.150> it<00:01:21.270> in<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:23.720> it<00:01:24.720> will

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:24.870 
your battery plug it in and it will

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.190 
your battery plug it in and it will
start<00:01:25.350> at<00:01:25.620> the<00:01:25.860> light<00:01:26.250> will<00:01:26.400> come<00:01:26.430> on<00:01:26.640> there

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
start at the light will come on there

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.020 
start at the light will come on there
and<00:01:28.200> then<00:01:28.260> when<00:01:28.680> it's<00:01:28.710> done<00:01:29.040> it<00:01:29.400> or<00:01:29.549> even<00:01:29.729> go

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
and then when it's done it or even go

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.740 
and then when it's done it or even go
out<00:01:30.210> or<00:01:30.479> start<00:01:30.900> blinking<00:01:31.140> really<00:01:31.830> slow<00:01:32.720> when<00:01:33.720> I

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
out or start blinking really slow when I

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.240 
out or start blinking really slow when I
first<00:01:34.020> charge<00:01:34.350> it<00:01:34.470> up<00:01:34.530> it<00:01:34.740> probably<00:01:35.040> took

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
first charge it up it probably took

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.980 
first charge it up it probably took
about<00:01:35.310> 10<00:01:35.700> minutes<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:36.060> charge<00:01:36.270> up<00:01:36.570> I<00:01:36.690> guess<00:01:36.840> it

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
about 10 minutes to charge up I guess it

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.770 
about 10 minutes to charge up I guess it
comes<00:01:37.110> with<00:01:37.200> some<00:01:37.409> charge<00:01:37.740> in<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.659> so<00:01:39.659> it's

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
comes with some charge in it so it's

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.090 
comes with some charge in it so it's
really<00:01:39.900> good<00:01:40.080> and<00:01:40.170> only<00:01:40.409> takes<00:01:40.619> about<00:01:40.710> 20

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
really good and only takes about 20

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.180 
really good and only takes about 20
minutes<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.400> charge<00:01:41.610> it<00:01:41.820> up<00:01:42.140> it<00:01:43.140> is<00:01:43.590> you

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
minutes to charge it up it is you

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.950 
minutes to charge it up it is you
probably<00:01:44.400> see<00:01:44.909> that<00:01:45.090> my<00:01:45.270> camera's<00:01:45.630> not<00:01:45.659> great

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
probably see that my camera's not great

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.460 
probably see that my camera's not great
at<00:01:46.110> zooming<00:01:46.439> it's<00:01:46.979> a<00:01:48.890> 3.7<00:01:49.890> volt<00:01:50.100> 120<00:01:50.640> million

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
at zooming it's a 3.7 volt 120 million

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.310 
at zooming it's a 3.7 volt 120 million
like<00:01:52.470> polymer<00:01:52.950> battery<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:53.689> you<00:01:54.689> get<00:01:54.930> one

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
like polymer battery and you get one

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:07.249 
like polymer battery and you get one
with<00:01:55.650> it<00:01:56.600> I'll<00:01:57.600> also<00:02:01.580> bought<00:02:03.049> another<00:02:04.049> two<00:02:06.259> you

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
with it I'll also bought another two you

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.929 
with it I'll also bought another two you
know<00:02:07.409> you<00:02:07.470> can't<00:02:07.740> there<00:02:08.159> any<00:02:08.310> cheap<00:02:08.549> learning

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:08.939 
know you can't there any cheap learning

00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:12.559 
know you can't there any cheap learning

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
about six seven pounds so not very much

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.800 
about six seven pounds so not very much
at<00:02:12.719> all<00:02:12.989> and<00:02:13.590> I've

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
at all and I've

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:20.880 
at all and I've
also<00:02:14.080> got<00:02:15.540> an<00:02:16.540> e<00:02:16.780> flite<00:02:17.670> 150<00:02:18.670> million<00:02:18.880> i<00:02:19.890> bought

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
also got an e flite 150 million i bought

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.140 
also got an e flite 150 million i bought
this<00:02:21.390> because<00:02:22.390> I'm<00:02:23.370> read<00:02:24.370> on<00:02:24.489> some<00:02:24.520> forums

just<00:02:25.630> before<00:02:25.900> got<00:02:26.110> this<00:02:26.260> plane<00:02:26.560> that<00:02:27.280> although

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
just before got this plane that although

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.030 
just before got this plane that although
these<00:02:27.730> batteries<00:02:28.180> are<00:02:28.239> good<00:02:28.590> if<00:02:29.590> you're<00:02:29.800> more

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
these batteries are good if you're more

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:36.360 
these batteries are good if you're more
flight<00:02:30.370> time<00:02:30.400> a<00:02:32.010> bit<00:02:33.010> better<00:02:33.160> response<00:02:35.370> 150

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
flight time a bit better response 150

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.089 
flight time a bit better response 150
milli<00:02:36.519> ampere<00:02:36.819> brilliant<00:02:37.450> for<00:02:37.780> it<00:02:37.950> so<00:02:38.950> yeah

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:39.099 
milli ampere brilliant for it so yeah

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:42.630 
milli ampere brilliant for it so yeah
I've<00:02:39.220> got<00:02:39.459> this<00:02:40.560> so<00:02:41.560> I've<00:02:41.830> got<00:02:42.280> for<00:02:42.519> all

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
I've got this so I've got for all

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.600 
I've got this so I've got for all
together<00:02:43.709> the<00:02:44.709> actual<00:02:44.860> plane<00:02:45.250> itself<00:02:47.610> done

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
together the actual plane itself done

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:55.740 
together the actual plane itself done
this<00:02:48.730> back<00:02:48.970> up<00:02:53.760> the<00:02:54.760> actual<00:02:55.060> plane<00:02:55.299> itself

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
this back up the actual plane itself

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.410 
this back up the actual plane itself
very<00:02:56.739> very<00:02:57.130> light<00:02:57.430> nice<00:02:58.299> plane<00:02:59.099> as<00:03:00.209> you<00:03:01.209> can

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
very very light nice plane as you can

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:09.380 
very very light nice plane as you can
