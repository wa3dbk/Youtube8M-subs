00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.330 
so I got to tell you my very favorite
feature<00:00:58.550> of<00:00:58.820> this<00:00:59.079> Grand<00:01:00.079> Cherokee<00:01:00.860> Ecodiesel

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
feature of this Grand Cherokee Ecodiesel

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.430 
feature of this Grand Cherokee Ecodiesel
is<00:01:01.760> the<00:01:01.910> fact<00:01:02.180> that<00:01:02.300> one<00:01:02.690> that<00:01:02.840> got<00:01:03.020> into<00:01:03.320> it

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
is the fact that one that got into it

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.820 
is the fact that one that got into it
and<00:01:03.620> had<00:01:03.800> over<00:01:04.100> 700<00:01:04.970> miles<00:01:05.210> of<00:01:05.570> range<00:01:05.840> that

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
and had over 700 miles of range that

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.969 
and had over 700 miles of range that
means<00:01:07.040> practically<00:01:07.610> you<00:01:08.210> might<00:01:08.390> be<00:01:08.540> able<00:01:08.750> to

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
means practically you might be able to

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:11.410 
means practically you might be able to
go<00:01:09.979> a<00:01:10.010> whole<00:01:10.310> month<00:01:10.580> without<00:01:10.760> having<00:01:10.940> to<00:01:11.270> go

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
go a whole month without having to go

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.930 
go a whole month without having to go
and<00:01:11.660> fill<00:01:12.170> it<00:01:12.259> up<00:01:12.380> with<00:01:12.590> diesel<00:01:12.830> that's<00:01:13.729> the

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940 
and fill it up with diesel that's the

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.710 
and fill it up with diesel that's the
upside<00:01:14.060> the<00:01:14.750> downside<00:01:15.320> is<00:01:15.710> that<00:01:16.690> diesel<00:01:17.690> of

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
upside the downside is that diesel of

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.380 
upside the downside is that diesel of
course<00:01:17.990> is<00:01:18.140> more<00:01:18.320> expensive<00:01:18.680> than<00:01:18.950> gas<00:01:19.910> but

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
course is more expensive than gas but

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.080 
course is more expensive than gas but
you<00:01:21.080> know<00:01:21.170> 20<00:01:21.470> cents<00:01:21.770> or<00:01:21.890> so<00:01:22.190> more<00:01:22.490> gallon<00:01:22.940> it's

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
you know 20 cents or so more gallon it's

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.670 
you know 20 cents or so more gallon it's
not<00:01:23.210> a<00:01:23.240> big<00:01:23.479> deal<00:01:23.630> not<00:01:23.840> like<00:01:23.990> you<00:01:24.110> Europeans

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
not a big deal not like you Europeans

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.700 
not a big deal not like you Europeans
wear<00:01:24.979> diesel<00:01:25.460> is<00:01:25.580> cheaper<00:01:26.020> here<00:01:27.020> a<00:01:27.380> little<00:01:27.590> bit

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
wear diesel is cheaper here a little bit

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.830 
wear diesel is cheaper here a little bit
more<00:01:27.890> expensive<00:01:28.160> but<00:01:28.430> just<00:01:28.729> a<00:01:28.820> fraction<00:01:29.300> the

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
more expensive but just a fraction the

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.980 
more expensive but just a fraction the
nice<00:01:30.080> thing<00:01:30.289> about<00:01:30.320> this<00:01:30.560> Jeep<00:01:30.800> is<00:01:30.950> this

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
nice thing about this Jeep is this
