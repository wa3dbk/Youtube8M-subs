00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:07.900
 ever a child asked his 

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:12.400
 father 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:13.900
 the papilla that means to be good 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.510
 no more 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:19.390
 an economically well-off father 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:22.720
 wanting his son to know what he is 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:25.509
 being poor led him to spend a 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:29.110
 couple of days in the bush with a family 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:32.810
 peasant spent three days and two nights 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:36.320
 in your country home 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:39.460
 once in the car back to 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:43.490
 the city the father asks his son 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:47.090
 waht do you think about the experience 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:50.060
 cute for bouquets the son has answered 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:53.360
 with your eyes on the distance and 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:55.910
 what you learned and where the father 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:59.210
 the son responded 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.880
 and we have a dog and they 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.340
 they have 4 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.980
 we have a pool with water 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.890
 stagnant that reaches the middle of the 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:12.870
 garden and they have a few rivers and a 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:15.970
 end of crystal clear water where there are fish 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:18.070
 that we import lanterns from 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.950
 East to light our garden 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:26.760
 while they shine with the 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.760
 stars the moon and candles on your table 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:32.550
 our patio reaches the fence 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.490
 theirs has no end 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:39.460
 that we buy our food and 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:42.840
 they sow and harvest theirs 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:45.719
 us today is not cinema 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.439
 they listen to a perpetual symphony of 

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:51.790
 swallow parakeets frogs toads 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:55.360
 cicadas and other animals 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:57.550
 all this sometimes combined by the 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.520
 sonorous song of a neighbor who works 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.250
 your mind 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.969
 We cook in an oven to explain 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.950
 them everything they eat has that flavor 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.890
 of the tongue stove 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.810
 that to protect us we live 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.560
 surrounded by a wall with alarms 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:20.950
 and they live with their doors open 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:23.590
 protected by the friendship of their neighbors 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:27.480
 we live connected to the telephone 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:30.720
 mobile to the computer and the TV 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:34.500
 they are connected to the 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:37.709
 life to the sky to the sun to the water to the green 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:41.299
 from the forest to animals to their crops 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.299
 To his family 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.180
 the father was shocked by the 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.210
 depth of his son and then the 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.000
 son finished 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:53.590
 thanks for palms 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.660
 thank you for teaching me 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.660
 and the poor who are thinking 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.880
 every day that passes we are poorer than 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:08.520
 spirit and appreciation for 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.900
 nature that are the great works of 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:14.610
 Sir 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:18.320
 we worry about having and having 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.320
 and we forget to be 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.680
 simply
