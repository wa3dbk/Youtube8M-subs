fender strand of Vox ac30 here's the

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:20.150 
fender strand of Vox ac30 here's the
clean<00:00:11.639> signal<00:00:18.590> okay<00:00:19.590> we're<00:00:19.920> going<00:00:20.010> to<00:00:20.070> be

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
clean signal okay we're going to be

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.179 
clean signal okay we're going to be
checking<00:00:20.369> out<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.990> octave<00:00:21.990> one<00:00:22.410> octave<00:00:22.859> below

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
checking out the octave one octave below

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.000 
checking out the octave one octave below
the<00:00:24.180> original<00:00:24.600> signal<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:25.170> see<00:00:25.320> how<00:00:25.500> well

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
the original signal and see how well

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.029 
the original signal and see how well
these<00:00:26.189> pedals<00:00:27.019> can<00:00:28.019> produce<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.619> octave

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
these pedals can produce the octave

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:50.990 
these pedals can produce the octave
sound<00:00:31.520> so<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.730> boss

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.190 

kind<00:00:52.000> of<00:00:52.030> warbles<00:00:52.480> a<00:00:52.600> little<00:00:52.870> bit<00:00:52.990> on<00:00:53.080> the

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:53.200 
kind of warbles a little bit on the

00:00:53.200 --> 00:01:22.160 
kind of warbles a little bit on the
lower<00:00:53.410> notes<00:01:08.490> let's<00:01:09.490> go<00:01:09.640> to<00:01:09.700> the<00:01:09.850> digi<00:01:10.210> tech

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:57.350 

it's<00:01:23.170> better<00:01:23.470> on<00:01:23.590> the<00:01:23.680> lower<00:01:24.010> notes

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.750 

you

00:01:59.750 --> 00:01:59.760 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.460 

now<00:02:00.760> let's<00:02:01.000> try<00:02:01.210> it<00:02:01.270> with<00:02:01.390> some<00:02:01.540> overdrive<00:02:02.259> I

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
now let's try it with some overdrive I

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.670 
now let's try it with some overdrive I
have<00:02:02.740> the<00:02:02.920> rat<00:02:03.189> going<00:02:03.700> after<00:02:04.150> the<00:02:04.330> pedal<00:02:04.680> after

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
have the rat going after the pedal after

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:52.050 
have the rat going after the pedal after
both<00:02:05.890> of<00:02:05.920> these<00:02:06.130> pedals<00:02:18.780> did<00:02:19.780> you<00:02:50.670> toss<00:02:51.670> we<00:02:51.910> can

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
both of these pedals did you toss we can

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.059 
both of these pedals did you toss we can
control<00:02:52.450> the<00:02:52.690> the<00:02:55.080> direct<00:02:56.080> signal<00:02:56.500> and<00:02:56.799> on<00:02:56.920> the

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
control the the direct signal and on the

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:12.509 
control the the direct signal and on the
digitech<00:02:57.640> we<00:02:57.819> can't<00:02:58.120> so

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:40.110 

now<00:03:13.519> let's<00:03:13.700> see<00:03:13.879> how<00:03:14.000> they<00:03:14.150> handle<00:03:14.390> Korg

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.420 

so<00:03:41.120> the<00:03:41.480> boss<00:03:41.660> is<00:03:41.900> kind<00:03:42.170> of<00:03:42.290> smoother<00:03:43.130> in<00:03:43.280> its

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
so the boss is kind of smoother in its

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.559 
so the boss is kind of smoother in its
own<00:03:43.610> way<00:03:43.819> but<00:03:43.849> it<00:03:44.270> doesn't<00:03:44.870> track<00:03:45.290> as<00:03:45.500> well<00:03:45.709> and

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:46.569 
own way but it doesn't track as well and

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:50.470 
own way but it doesn't track as well and
we<00:03:47.569> even<00:03:48.230> have<00:03:48.470> like<00:03:48.650> a<00:03:48.709> sub<00:03:49.130> octave<00:03:49.760> two

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
we even have like a sub octave two

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:57.210 
we even have like a sub octave two
octaves<00:03:50.900> down<00:03:51.190> gives<00:03:52.190> you<00:03:52.340> even<00:03:52.459> more<00:03:52.660> fatness

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:50.879 

some<00:03:58.220> delay<00:03:58.580> from<00:03:58.819> Boston<00:03:59.330> to<00:03:59.420> 20

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:50.889 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:53.379 

so<00:04:51.889> that's<00:04:52.280> the<00:04:52.490> comparison<00:04:53.060> of<00:04:53.210> these<00:04:53.330> two

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:53.389 
so that's the comparison of these two

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:56.830 
so that's the comparison of these two
petals<00:04:54.289> and<00:04:54.970> thanks<00:04:55.970> for<00:04:56.150> watching<00:04:56.569> if<00:04:56.720> you

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
petals and thanks for watching if you

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.340 
petals and thanks for watching if you
