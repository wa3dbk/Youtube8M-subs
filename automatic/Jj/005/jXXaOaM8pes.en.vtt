pretty<00:01:56.070> good<00:01:56.219> on<00:01:56.340> defense<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.270> last<00:01:57.540> two

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
pretty good on defense to the last two

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.399 
pretty good on defense to the last two
drives<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.549> still<00:01:59.549> play<00:01:59.729> with<00:01:59.990> really<00:02:00.990> super

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
drives and still play with really super

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.850 
drives and still play with really super
effort<00:02:01.740> I<00:02:01.860> thought<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.659> yeah<00:02:03.659> I<00:02:03.930> told<00:02:04.409> the

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
effort I thought and yeah I told the

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.260 
effort I thought and yeah I told the
team's<00:02:05.189> probably<00:02:05.549> way<00:02:05.670> they<00:02:05.820> played<00:02:06.060> the

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
team's probably way they played the

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.119 
team's probably way they played the
defense<00:02:06.630> played<00:02:06.840> their<00:02:06.990> hearts<00:02:07.110> out<00:02:07.350> played

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
defense played their hearts out played

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.339 
defense played their hearts out played
with<00:02:08.280> effort<00:02:08.640> and<00:02:08.940> we<00:02:09.450> stopped<00:02:09.720> in<00:02:09.929> most<00:02:10.140> of

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
with effort and we stopped in most of

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.160 
with effort and we stopped in most of
the<00:02:10.440> time<00:02:10.679> but<00:02:11.690> unfortunately<00:02:12.690> they<00:02:12.780> hit

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
the time but unfortunately they hit

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.990 
the time but unfortunately they hit
hit<00:02:13.290> a<00:02:13.319> couple<00:02:13.530> a<00:02:13.860> couple<00:02:14.160> of<00:02:14.340> big<00:02:14.490> balls<00:02:14.700> act

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
hit a couple a couple of big balls act

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.180 
hit a couple a couple of big balls act
in<00:02:15.209> gee<00:02:15.870> I<00:02:15.900> thought<00:02:16.050> we<00:02:16.380> could<00:02:16.410> throw<00:02:16.980> and

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
in gee I thought we could throw and

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.680 
in gee I thought we could throw and
catch<00:02:17.340> a<00:02:17.550> little<00:02:17.730> bit<00:02:17.849> better<00:02:18.030> and<00:02:18.150> we<00:02:18.270> did<00:02:18.480> but

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
catch a little bit better and we did but

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.130 
catch a little bit better and we did but
we<00:02:18.750> didn't<00:02:19.110> so<00:02:20.300> sometimes<00:02:21.300> when<00:02:21.599> that<00:02:21.780> happens

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
we didn't so sometimes when that happens

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.610 
we didn't so sometimes when that happens
you<00:02:22.260> get<00:02:22.380> beat<00:02:22.620> I<00:02:22.739> guess<00:02:23.780> simple<00:02:24.780> as<00:02:24.840> that<00:02:24.870> well

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
you get beat I guess simple as that well

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.990 
you get beat I guess simple as that well
I<00:02:25.650> thought<00:02:26.040> we<00:02:26.220> were<00:02:26.280> really<00:02:26.430> ready<00:02:26.670> to<00:02:26.760> play

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
I thought we were really ready to play

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.180 
I thought we were really ready to play
in<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.209> defense<00:02:27.770> defensive<00:02:28.770> players<00:02:28.980> were

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
in the defense defensive players were

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.160 
in the defense defensive players were
really<00:02:29.550> ready<00:02:29.700> to<00:02:29.910> play<00:02:30.090> I<00:02:30.300> thought<00:02:30.720> we<00:02:30.930> would

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
really ready to play I thought we would

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.729 
really ready to play I thought we would
do<00:02:31.350> a<00:02:31.380> little<00:02:31.590> bit<00:02:31.709> better<00:02:31.860> offensively<00:02:32.580> but

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
do a little bit better offensively but

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.130 
do a little bit better offensively but
it<00:02:34.739> didn't<00:02:35.010> work<00:02:35.130> out<00:02:35.310> that<00:02:35.370> way<00:02:35.730> and<00:02:36.140> give

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
it didn't work out that way and give

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.570 
it didn't work out that way and give
Missouri<00:02:37.350> credit<00:02:37.890> they're<00:02:38.040> probably<00:02:38.280> a<00:02:38.430> lot

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
Missouri credit they're probably a lot

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.490 
Missouri credit they're probably a lot
better<00:02:38.700> team<00:02:39.060> than<00:02:39.090> they<00:02:39.720> showed<00:02:39.959> last<00:02:40.200> week

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
better team than they showed last week

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.540 
better team than they showed last week
and<00:02:41.340> they<00:02:42.230> they<00:02:43.230> came<00:02:43.500> to<00:02:43.650> play<00:02:43.890> we<00:02:44.280> had<00:02:44.430> our

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
and they they came to play we had our

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.059 
and they they came to play we had our
chances<00:02:44.910> and<00:02:45.209> we<00:02:45.450> we<00:02:45.989> didn't<00:02:46.709> get<00:02:46.800> it<00:02:46.860> done

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
chances and we we didn't get it done

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.559 
chances and we we didn't get it done
simple<00:02:47.730> as<00:02:47.819> that<00:02:47.850> and<00:02:50.030> we'll<00:02:51.030> go<00:02:51.180> back<00:02:51.390> to

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
simple as that and we'll go back to

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:52.940 
simple as that and we'll go back to
