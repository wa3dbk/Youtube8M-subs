00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
another way you can separate the eggs is

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.510 
another way you can separate the eggs is
to<00:01:00.239> just<00:01:00.660> drop<00:01:00.899> it<00:01:01.140> into<00:01:01.289> your<00:01:01.469> hand<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.250> let

the yolk fall through your fingers like

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.580 
the yolk fall through your fingers like
this<00:01:11.299> the<00:01:12.299> yolk<00:01:12.510> will<00:01:12.540> just<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:13.170> mean<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.409> white

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
this the yolk will just I mean the white

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
the yolk stays intact the trick is

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.359 
the yolk stays intact the trick is
opening<00:01:23.490> that<00:01:23.670> egg<00:01:23.909> very<00:01:24.530> carefully<00:01:25.530> so<00:01:26.340> that

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
opening that egg very carefully so that

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.940 
opening that egg very carefully so that
you<00:01:26.610> don't<00:01:27.380> pierce<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.710> yolk<00:01:30.500> and<00:01:31.500> get<00:01:31.710> all

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
you don't pierce the yolk and get all

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.969 
you don't pierce the yolk and get all
that<00:01:31.979> point<00:01:32.490> if<00:01:32.700> any<00:01:33.360> yolk<00:01:33.810> gets<00:01:34.259> into<00:01:34.860> the

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
that point if any yolk gets into the

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.270 
that point if any yolk gets into the
white<00:01:35.220> if<00:01:35.640> it's<00:01:35.880> only<00:01:36.060> a<00:01:36.180> tiny<00:01:36.540> bit<00:01:37.280> sometimes

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
white if it's only a tiny bit sometimes

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.190 
white if it's only a tiny bit sometimes
you<00:01:38.490> can<00:01:38.700> take<00:01:39.290> just<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.470> paper<00:01:40.770> napkin<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:42.200> do

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
you can take just a paper napkin and do

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.280 
you can take just a paper napkin and do
this<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:43.829> soak<00:01:44.399> up<00:01:44.640> any<00:01:44.880> little<00:01:45.180> tiny<00:01:45.299> bits<00:01:46.079> of

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
this and soak up any little tiny bits of

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.780 
this and soak up any little tiny bits of
yolk<00:01:46.530> but<00:01:46.740> you<00:01:46.860> want<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.100> make<00:01:47.250> sure<00:01:47.280> that<00:01:47.700> you

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
yolk but you want to make sure that you

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.090 
yolk but you want to make sure that you
get<00:01:47.909> every<00:01:48.570> bit<00:01:48.780> of<00:01:48.840> yolk<00:01:49.200> out<00:01:49.470> of<00:01:49.619> there<00:01:49.770> if

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
get every bit of yolk out of there if

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.149 
get every bit of yolk out of there if
you<00:01:50.610> get<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:50.820> lot<00:01:51.180> of<00:01:51.210> yolk<00:01:51.689> in<00:01:52.049> your<00:01:52.200> white<00:01:52.439> then

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
you get a lot of yolk in your white then

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.330 
you get a lot of yolk in your white then
your<00:01:53.340> best<00:01:53.670> just<00:01:54.740> discarding<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.860> whites<00:01:56.070> and

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
your best just discarding the whites and

your best just discarding the whites and
starting<00:01:56.850> over<00:01:57.000> again<00:01:57.290> because<00:01:58.290> any<00:01:58.950> yolk<00:01:59.610> in

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
starting over again because any yolk in

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.359 
starting over again because any yolk in
that<00:02:00.180> white<00:02:00.420> will<00:02:00.750> cause<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.350> whites<00:02:01.560> not<00:02:01.979> to

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
that white will cause the whites not to

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.790 
that white will cause the whites not to
whip<00:02:02.579> up
