00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.320
 because we are all going to install the 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.680
 downloaded application 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.630
 in this case 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.170
 they look for it in their folder where the 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.170
 saved 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:24.890
 after looking for it we proceed to 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:27.270
 install the application I want to tell you 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.570
 of what 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:32.160
 how am I going to do it with facebook this 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.680
 configuration is going to work with 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.300
 the other applications that I will leave 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.360
 so I'm going to do it with facebook 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.580
 because it's simpler to explain and to 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.620
 that they understand better good after 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.960
 she find the application is going to 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.620
 show the hanging of your cell phone already 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.629
 They will be able to 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.790
 you have to understand very well your 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.400
 cellular without knowing it handle very well 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:56.460
 to know how to configure what they are going to 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:59.250
 connections 16 menus manage the 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.440
 connection profiles of people and here 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.780
 shows us all the profiles in this 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.790
 case is the handsome one that I have we give him 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.920
 in options and edit if they do not have 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:13.460
 none give to deliver and this avoid 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:16.280
 the name can be which concentrates psm 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.909
 you can put any name the 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.920
 url start is also a web 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:23.689
 Alternatively they can have anything if 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.950
 he asks for a carrier he has to be 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:30.080
 carrier gprs ok the next trip should 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:40.310
 be activated in the proxy address 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:44.869
 it's 19 8.22 8.90 point 228 ready and the 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:47.600
 port is going to be 87 99 yes I know if its 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:49.880
 cellular does not bring port obviously 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.240
 after here the address would come 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:58.050
 two points after 228 would come two 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:02:01.820
 points 87 99 if I do not remember 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:05.130
 ok and the waiting time is to your liking 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:08.070
 that is what is most necessary and also the 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:12.590
 the name login name that has 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.590
 that be wat point consell puntocom 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:39.460
 then we go to games you know 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:42.340
 have to do so he goes out with the 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:44.500
 with web option if I put it out 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.500
 with another connection it will not work 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.850
 they heard in this this cell phone has this 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.800
 advantage that each application 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:54.190
 I can configure it with my connection 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.870
 that I want in other cell phones do not 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.580
 it's going to look like from fontur the option that 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.620
 all applications are going to pull with 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.780
 the profile that you have indicated then 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.880
 they're all going to talk to that profile in my 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.580
 case I can each application 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.380
 alarcÃ³n 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.200
 with the profile that I want good 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.750
 we start 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.239
 the application and we wait for it to change 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:18.080
 how will the menu first show us 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:21.950
 Andrew and I bring already set 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:24.800
 comes configured so just 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:30.970
 what they have to do is 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:30.970
 give in 6 in save and ready 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:40.280
 as we can see every application always 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:43.070
 when you are going to use the network gives us a 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.810
 prevention message that if we want 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:49.060
 use the network because there may be 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.060
 costs then I'm going to give him 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:09.730
 I tell you that the speed of the connection 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:11.980
 it may vary depending on where 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:15.520
 you are from the part of Colombia or 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:17.799
 it also depends on when you are 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:21.130
 connected ready as we can see already I 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:25.090
 home here tell me email 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:26.650
 I proceed to put my mail already from 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.200
 what is in them already means that 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.920
 it works ready then here they come to 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.450
 use your email 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.950
 since your password is not going to do it 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:38.550
 because since I entered here he wants 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.550
 say that I have 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:47.140
 and it's the next one that always when 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:50.340
 they will start the application they will 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:52.720
 appear the same Andrew if this menu 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:55.300
 then if you do not want it back shrink 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:59.320
 if you do not want to see him again 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:01.780
 they just give him here where he says show 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:05.770
 with this it means to show the 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:09.070
 then they just take it off 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:12.520
 the chulito sets it apart I do not know if it is achieved 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:16.860
 just see the rest of us unmarked and 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.860
 they give him 6 ready 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:22.289
 after they give him in save when 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:25.409
 close the application and return it to 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:27.520
 open the menu will no longer appear 

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:29.410
 jable 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.110
 because they have already given the order that 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:35.819
 appear more and simply going to enter 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.819
 direct let's get out quickly
