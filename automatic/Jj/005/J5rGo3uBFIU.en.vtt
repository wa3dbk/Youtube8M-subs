00:01:35.559 --> 00:01:35.569 
2-liter plastic soda bottle you want to

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:40.919 
2-liter plastic soda bottle you want to
make<00:01:35.719> a<00:01:35.749> cut<00:01:36.109> in<00:01:36.259> it<00:01:38.020> right<00:01:39.020> along<00:01:39.170> here<00:01:39.859> along

00:01:40.919 --> 00:01:40.929 
make a cut in it right along here along

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:45.339 
make a cut in it right along here along
this<00:01:41.929> plane<00:01:43.179> so<00:01:44.179> what<00:01:44.329> will<00:01:44.450> happen<00:01:44.810> is<00:01:44.990> you

00:01:45.339 --> 00:01:45.349 
this plane so what will happen is you

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:50.050 
this plane so what will happen is you
will<00:01:45.439> end<00:01:45.649> up<00:01:45.799> with<00:01:45.859> two<00:01:46.849> pieces<00:01:47.149> that<00:01:49.060> look

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
will end up with two pieces that look

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.709 
will end up with two pieces that look
like<00:01:50.119> this<00:01:51.429> you<00:01:52.429> have<00:01:52.579> the<00:01:52.729> top<00:01:52.969> and<00:01:53.299> you<00:01:53.599> have

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:53.719 
like this you have the top and you have

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:57.370 
like this you have the top and you have
the<00:01:53.899> bottom<00:01:55.179> now<00:01:56.179> I<00:01:56.240> usually<00:01:56.659> take<00:01:56.840> the<00:01:57.020> label

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
the bottom now I usually take the label

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.349 
the bottom now I usually take the label
off<00:01:57.590> because<00:01:58.189> it<00:01:58.429> allows<00:01:58.669> it<00:01:58.849> to<00:01:58.880> work<00:01:59.119> better

00:01:59.349 --> 00:01:59.359 
off because it allows it to work better

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:02.409 
off because it allows it to work better
also<00:01:59.779> you<00:01:59.869> can<00:02:00.049> see<00:02:00.200> inside<00:02:00.590> what's<00:02:01.119> you<00:02:02.119> are

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:02.419 
also you can see inside what's you are

00:02:02.419 --> 00:02:06.940 
also you can see inside what's you are
collecting<00:02:04.689> notice<00:02:05.689> how<00:02:05.840> the<00:02:05.899> top<00:02:06.169> fits<00:02:06.560> in

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
collecting notice how the top fits in

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.310 
collecting notice how the top fits in
like<00:02:07.520> so<00:02:07.819> so<00:02:08.239> this<00:02:08.390> is<00:02:08.569> now<00:02:08.780> a<00:02:09.050> funnel<00:02:10.510> well<00:02:11.510> but

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
like so so this is now a funnel well but

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.960 
like so so this is now a funnel well but
the<00:02:12.410> next<00:02:12.680> thing<00:02:12.800> I<00:02:12.920> do

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
the next thing I do

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.690 
the next thing I do
as<00:02:14.030> I<00:02:14.540> put<00:02:14.780> a<00:02:14.810> small<00:02:15.170> piece<00:02:15.500> of<00:02:15.560> screen<00:02:16.070> in<00:02:16.280> the

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
as I put a small piece of screen in the

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.360 
as I put a small piece of screen in the
top<00:02:16.730> here<00:02:17.350> if<00:02:18.350> because<00:02:18.830> if<00:02:19.010> you're<00:02:19.160> putting

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
top here if because if you're putting

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.810 
top here if because if you're putting
fine<00:02:19.880> materials<00:02:21.130> that<00:02:22.130> you're<00:02:22.340> hoping<00:02:22.490> to

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
fine materials that you're hoping to

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.340 
fine materials that you're hoping to
collect<00:02:23.000> insects<00:02:23.540> from<00:02:23.750> you<00:02:23.900> don't<00:02:24.020> want<00:02:24.230> that

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
collect insects from you don't want that

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.110 
collect insects from you don't want that
material<00:02:24.920> falling<00:02:25.190> through<00:02:25.520> the<00:02:25.640> funnel<00:02:25.850> you

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
material falling through the funnel you

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.330 
material falling through the funnel you
only<00:02:26.270> want<00:02:26.510> the<00:02:26.630> living<00:02:26.900> organisms<00:02:27.470> to<00:02:28.160> make

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
only want the living organisms to make

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.010 
only want the living organisms to make
it<00:02:28.460> through<00:02:28.640> the<00:02:28.730> funnel<00:02:28.940> so<00:02:29.920> I<00:02:32.020> have

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
it through the funnel so I have

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.160 
it through the funnel so I have
collected<00:02:33.380> some<00:02:33.740> material<00:02:34.310> here<00:02:35.080> now<00:02:36.080> the

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
collected some material here now the

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.140 
collected some material here now the
next<00:02:36.500> step<00:02:36.710> is<00:02:36.740> to<00:02:37.100> place<00:02:37.250> a<00:02:37.580> small<00:02:37.970> jar<00:02:38.770> of

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
next step is to place a small jar of

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.260 
next step is to place a small jar of
preservative<00:02:41.150> usually<00:02:41.570> 70%<00:02:42.290> alcohol<00:02:43.270> into

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
preservative usually 70% alcohol into

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.520 
preservative usually 70% alcohol into
the<00:02:44.390> bottom<00:02:44.750> like<00:02:45.200> so<00:02:46.180> you<00:02:47.180> then<00:02:47.360> put<00:02:47.600> this<00:02:47.810> top

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
the bottom like so you then put this top

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.120 
the bottom like so you then put this top
part<00:02:48.860> on<00:02:50.080> then<00:02:51.080> you<00:02:51.200> put<00:02:51.410> the<00:02:51.560> material<00:02:51.680> that

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
part on then you put the material that

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.050 
part on then you put the material that
you've<00:02:52.250> collected<00:02:53.290> into<00:02:54.290> the<00:02:54.410> funnel<00:02:55.060> now

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
you've collected into the funnel now

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.670 
you've collected into the funnel now
it's<00:02:56.240> important<00:02:56.720> that<00:02:56.750> you<00:02:56.900> don't<00:02:57.140> pack<00:02:57.470> it

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
it's important that you don't pack it

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.580 
it's important that you don't pack it
too<00:02:57.860> tightly<00:02:58.280> because<00:02:58.959> you<00:02:59.959> want<00:03:00.200> the<00:03:00.320> little

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
too tightly because you want the little

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.090 
too tightly because you want the little
insects<00:03:01.580> that<00:03:01.910> are<00:03:01.970> in<00:03:02.660> this<00:03:02.900> material<00:03:03.080> to<00:03:03.950> be

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
insects that are in this material to be

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.130 
insects that are in this material to be
able<00:03:04.310> to<00:03:04.400> travel<00:03:04.670> through<00:03:04.850> freely<00:03:05.750> up<00:03:05.930> and

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
able to travel through freely up and

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.890 
able to travel through freely up and
down<00:03:06.350> through<00:03:06.830> it<00:03:07.150> so<00:03:08.150> once<00:03:08.330> you<00:03:08.450> have<00:03:08.600> it<00:03:08.750> set

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
down through it so once you have it set

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:14.790 
down through it so once you have it set
up<00:03:09.050> like<00:03:09.290> so<00:03:09.790> you<00:03:10.790> then<00:03:11.000> bring<00:03:11.330> a<00:03:11.690> light<00:03:12.230> source

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.220 

turn<00:03:15.800> the<00:03:15.980> light<00:03:16.160> source<00:03:16.430> on<00:03:16.700> and<00:03:17.030> it<00:03:17.870> provides

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
turn the light source on and it provides

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.780 
turn the light source on and it provides
heat<00:03:18.650> and<00:03:18.890> it<00:03:19.370> also<00:03:19.610> begins<00:03:20.269> to<00:03:20.420> dry<00:03:20.750> out<00:03:20.989> the

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
heat and it also begins to dry out the

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.060 
heat and it also begins to dry out the
material<00:03:22.790> here<00:03:23.060> forcing<00:03:23.780> the<00:03:24.320> tiny<00:03:24.590> insects

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
material here forcing the tiny insects

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.520 
material here forcing the tiny insects
down<00:03:25.610> through<00:03:25.940> the<00:03:26.030> material<00:03:26.510> through<00:03:27.380> the

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
down through the material through the

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.740 
down through the material through the
funnel<00:03:27.769> and<00:03:28.070> then<00:03:28.310> they<00:03:28.489> fall<00:03:28.790> into<00:03:29.180> the

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
funnel and then they fall into the

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.690 
funnel and then they fall into the
preservative<00:03:30.380> so<00:03:30.950> then<00:03:31.100> you<00:03:31.250> can<00:03:31.459> identify

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
preservative so then you can identify

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.970 
preservative so then you can identify
them<00:03:32.360> count<00:03:32.750> them<00:03:32.959> do<00:03:33.230> whatever<00:03:33.410> you<00:03:33.709> need<00:03:33.739> to

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
them count them do whatever you need to

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.540 
them count them do whatever you need to
do<00:03:34.600> very<00:03:35.600> simple<00:03:36.019> setup<00:03:36.290> but<00:03:37.280> a<00:03:37.310> very

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:37.550 
do very simple setup but a very

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.600 
do very simple setup but a very
effective<00:03:37.910> way<00:03:38.500> to<00:03:39.500> capture<00:03:39.739> a<00:03:39.920> great<00:03:40.250> number

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
effective way to capture a great number

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.480 
effective way to capture a great number
of<00:03:40.640> soil<00:03:40.970> insects
