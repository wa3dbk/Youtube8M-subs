00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 Hi everybody, I 'm going to answer today. 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.810
 a tag for you that calls to my fashion 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.300
 It's a cool tag with questions. 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.099
 about fashion obviously 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.080
 and for those who did not know the farm yet 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.770
 I did not want the day there on the blog every Tuesday. 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.840
 Thursday and Saturday are the coolest and I 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.920
 I hope you like it, I'll leave it. 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.859
 here for those who do not yet 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.980
 you know the first question is which 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:29.670
 What kind of clothes would you never wear? 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.180
 I really like tight clothes or clothes. 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.200
 I feel uncomfortable 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.140
 So I think the best way to 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.809
 answer this question is one is are 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.239
 types of clothes that I do not feel good 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.890
 in them because when we use a 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.629
 clothes that we do not feel good at 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.530
 people do not feel beautiful people stay 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.629
 uncomfortable and I hate it so I 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.949
 already change and put on a clothes that I like 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.969
 so I think this is the kind of clothes 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.030
 that I would not use 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.250
 2 What kind of clothes do you love to wear? 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.039
 who will follow the blog knows that I 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.739
 I love to wear the skirt camisetinhas 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.720
 funny prints and blazer I guess 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.020
 that only the three pieces that I most use 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:13.290
 skirt and blazer and sneaker 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.200
 I love the four together or apart. 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.200
 I also feel super comfortable with 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:23.189
 very feminine will and I like 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.920
 Larger clothes face print 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.890
 likes or dislikes 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:33.570
 I do not think there are any prints that 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:35.520
 I hate that I would never wear I am 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.890
 very basic then usually mine 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.049
 clothes are smoother and such but I am 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.979
 trying to play more and learn to use 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.610
 prints 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.829
 so I'm trying to risk everything 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:49.590
 four have used something just for having 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:52.860
 gain is not never gained anything that I do not 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.899
 I do not like to get much clothes 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:02:02.130
 I always go there and I even know 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:04.829
 So I will not take it down, it's time to 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:09.000
 Me I like to wear strapless 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:10.849
 because I think that part of me is 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.460
 very wide and I have a loot 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:14.830
 and I 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.330
 I do not know a little big so I can not 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.040
 say it will fall more for example 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.170
 a party dress 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.460
 I think pretty strapless up in 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.010
 My brother's wedding that I went to 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:27.100
 godmother I used to have it fall still 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:30.100
 At the time of the ceremony I put a veil 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.930
 How do they call it a leap here? 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.050
 cover this part for more 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:38.470
 delicate chic and her from the party I took 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:41.680
 cause of the falling sea so I like more 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.960
 not on me totally dream occasions 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.980
 more special 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:51.060
 the next question is skirt or dress 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:53.470
 Get out, I have a lot of skirt and I love skirt. 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.840
 more skirt skirts waist skirts 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:59.230
 High colored printed skirts lines 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.120
 Leather I love dress has some I 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:05.650
 I started wearing more dress now 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:09.070
 This summer, but I prefer skirt 7 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.210
 what they say is ugly but you think 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.430
 pretty 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:14.860
 I was thinking about this 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.630
 But I did not get to a 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.430
 answer because I think every person 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.850
 have a different opinion 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.830
 It might be that I like to love something and 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.490
 another person does not like but someone else 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:29.620
 Like it too I think it does not exist 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:34.060
 Wow this is horrible because every person 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:35.710
 It has a different taste then 8 What 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.440
 it would be a vulgar thing 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:40.390
 ah I was alone answered this tag 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.100
 And I really liked her response. 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.500
 because I think it makes a costume 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:47.440
 vulgar is her person and her attitudes . 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:51.310
 You know but something else that I do too. 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:54.250
 I was thinking is a is a biotype of 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.880
 person, for example if the person does not 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.260
 has a lot of know she can wear a neckline 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.120
 a low-cut blouse that will not 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.980
 to be so vulgar knows if a person 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.090
 have more sense if they wear a 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.100
 stay more place 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.020
 so if the person has ass and whispered 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.160
 in the cell wear a very short skirt goes 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.990
 stay more place 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.850
 if the person is thinner company 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:16.060
 but yes she can use it will be a place 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:18.580
 so I think it's all a matter of 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.680
 balance to balance things i do not like 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:23.260
 too much to wear for example then 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.639
 I love wearing short skirts I like 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.680
 balance its use 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:29.349
 It's shorter, I close but here it is. 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.749
 left - defeated or if there was a blouse 

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:34.719
 with neckline or with transparency 

00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:35.889
 I use a lower part that covers more 

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:39.400
 knows that I think it's a matter of 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:41.979
 balance their attitudes to a 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.259
 beautiful example to say 20 she can use a 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:47.319
 most glued dress in the universe 

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:50.650
 fairer and shorter and shorter than 

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:54.430
 she will not be vulgar to do is understand 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:56.860
 for this question am in 9 which 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.180
 They are the four colors do you have in 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.330
 your wardrobe 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:03.550
 I have too much white I had no idea of 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.919
 How many white clothes did I have? 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.210
 too black too, I have more colors 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:10.449
 neutral 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:12.279
 So I have prints that I can not 

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:14.050
 set a color only but as I said 

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:16.389
 I'm trying to be more colorful then 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.250
 Dinho's more stamping things so I 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:21.129
 I have enough navy blue too. 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:24.580
 I think it's the four colors I 

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:26.469
 I have more and the four colors do not 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:29.169
 things you do not have in your wardrobe 

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:33.099
 I do not like wearing brown clothes. 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:34.180
 I do not like wearing red clothes for 

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:36.550
 more than with a T-shirt 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.800
 red I think this is the only 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:40.479
 red clothes I have even a skirt 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:45.360
 red too but I almost do not use 

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:50.229
 red clothes do not know why with 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:51.669
 red I think I just had not 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:53.770
 very yellow did not like to use 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:55.449
 yellow but I used it once everybody 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:58.270
 You said you looked so good in me now. 

00:05:55.449 --> 00:06:00.250
 the whole shop I go I see a piece 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:01.930
 I like yellow so I have it with a 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:03.639
 using a lot of yellow too 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:05.139
 lately so I think it's well 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:08.199
 colorful and cheerful 

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:11.349
 well that was all the questions about 

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:13.439
 fashion style and I love playing with 

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:17.500
 clothes because we can 

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:19.719
 transmit our being and not our 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:22.000
 companies a standard a standard of 

00:06:19.719 --> 00:06:24.219
 beauty in everyone is using what 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.330
 you should use the use you want and 

00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:28.319
 be happy 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.319
 a kiss and
