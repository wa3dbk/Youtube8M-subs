00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
develop stuff easier will be in the dog

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.960 
develop stuff easier will be in the dog
fighting<00:02:54.870> module<00:02:55.290> probably<00:02:55.859> when<00:02:56.069> it<00:02:56.700> gets

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
fighting module probably when it gets

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.539 
fighting module probably when it gets
released<00:02:57.150> PBR<00:02:58.049> will<00:02:58.440> be<00:02:58.560> converting

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
released PBR will be converting

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:00.800 
released PBR will be converting
everything<00:02:59.819> make<00:03:00.209> everything<00:03:00.420> look<00:03:00.660> better

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
everything make everything look better

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.960 
everything make everything look better
so<00:03:01.650> hopefully<00:03:02.099> we<00:03:02.250> should<00:03:02.310> see<00:03:02.760> that

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
so hopefully we should see that

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.149 
so hopefully we should see that
otherwise<00:03:03.359> it's<00:03:04.290> not<00:03:04.500> looking<00:03:04.769> like<00:03:04.890> we<00:03:05.010> may

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:05.159
