00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:05.350
Lies that breathe and hold me all this time

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.800
Lies that hurt and put me downward

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:15.350
Lies to live and lease and lie again is the sharpest thing

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:18.550
When we stay full alert in the darkest field

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.100
We go driving to keep me away

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:29.300
Make it feel all my love with enough when you are down

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.250
And to stand full awake I want this to be the fool

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.100
Keep hiding need to know

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:42.850
It's the same but to have enough when you are lost

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.200
Let me take your turn to behind tell me what you mean

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.700
You're running away but you never told me

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.350
Don't catch me if you can

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:57.650
You know this

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.150
Coming behind tell me what you need

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.650
You'll see me again but you never told me

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.350
Don't push me hold the line

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.650
Adore me

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.900
Don't catch me you and I

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.650
Found her tonight and breathe somehow

00:01:52.650 --> 00:02:01.350
While I'm sinking didn't live this time

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.650
Brought her tonight and breathe somehow

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:14.500
While I'm sinking didn't feel this time

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.950
Let me take your turn to behind tell me what you mean

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.450
You're running away but you never told me

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:41.100
Don't catch me if you can

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.450
You know this

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.900
Don't leave behind tell me what you need

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.400
You'll see me again but you never told me

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:55.050
Don't push me hold the line

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.400
Adore me

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.650
Don't catch me you and I
