00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:06.740
 that give all guys that more like 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:08.840
 are and are all welcome 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.980
 again today we are again of 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.690
 back and this time we'll talk 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.429
 about what is especially a 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.320
 category of weapons within the great 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:16.880
 Paul has been such a small comparison 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.860
 as we could do with call of 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.050
 duty with the theme the sniper is going to be something 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.970
 very very important I think that this 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.529
 part comes to completely form another 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.000
 community within the play is 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:27.080
 really the slide theme but you guys 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.699
 very well they know 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.830
 there are people dedicated to this topic there are 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:32.629
 whole communities working on what 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.820
 which is the theme of the slide pick in games 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:35.900
 of shooters before this and 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.460
 really I think that this part is going to 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.110
 come to form something main something 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.610
 primordial within this game maybe 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.320
 as soon as it reaches its launch 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.519
 official and good just in this video 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.989
 we'll talk a little bit about what it is 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:46.280
 the sniper the sniper that is known until 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:48.140
 the moment more or less how is that 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.790
 it works and details a little bit curious 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.989
 referring to what this is going out so 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.299
 in the background we will be seeing what they are 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.190
 some fragments of gameplay 

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:56.659
 with what the sniper is, we will be 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.339
 watching out there different games of 

00:00:56.659 --> 00:00:59.659
 which was using different 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:01.820
 accessories which are available 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:03.799
 to put what is your combination 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.210
 of class so guys for now 

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:06.979
 only what we know in what is 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.840
 the beta of is great fail is only 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.010
 we have what is a weapon of this 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.720
 category 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.570
 as such we only have what 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.400
 is the water tmr saleh is a sniper the 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.320
 which is semiautomatic that has 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.120
 eight bullets in each of his cartridges 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.890
 and good guys really is an interface 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.660
 of normalito really is not a hyper 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.670
 super recharged in really has a 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.110
 very normal damage output maybe not 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.430
 we could get to compare with some 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.920
 he is hyper known in another shooter 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.170
 previous to this one is really why 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.420
 maybe they do not have a lot of damage to the is a 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.100
 pretty normal I'm not so is 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.870
 so overloaded or nothing really is 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.890
 a very well balanced and good hyper 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.180
 guys there really is not much 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.500
 combination of accessories of which 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.850
 we will be able to be observing 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.560
 moment at the beginning of what was this 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.320
 example and they started seeing a few 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.420
 clicks with what was the sniper colo that 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.580
 is your original look or your look with the 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.070
 which give you the unlock start 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.050
 see what a zoom lens looks like 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.729
 six tasks and that's exactly when 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.960
 unlock this is how you have it and good 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.580
 inside the other accessories that are 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.229
 available within the beta of Tehran 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.570
 fail we only have what it is 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.280
 the muffler the look cob and other 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.380
 extra look which has a zoom of 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.729
 4.5 so in this case we do not have to 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.680
 we are seeing a configuration of 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.000
 class which contains the sight ago 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.470
 it also contains what is the 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.330
 Muffler goes out kid really 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.100
 a category of weapons as I comment 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.720
 in which it is more important to speak out 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.030
 especially because of the amount of 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.610
 people who use other SchÃ¼rrer gives 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.530
 really to the quite community of the 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.700
 which one participates against this type I 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.560
 I think pretty well come to do 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.150
 a little analysis about the future 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.620
 that has the snap and how is the 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.420
 sniper community in what this 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.100
 next paintball game so 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.780
 guys at the moment really is the only 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.160
 weapon that is really known that is 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.140
 very reduced to what is the subject of the 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.060
 weapons in the vein very reduce the issue of 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.740
 the accessories I suppose maybe 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.450
 of the final game I will see many 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.280
 more things to combine such do 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.600
 many more weapons I do not think anything else 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.670
 stay that way I say it really is very 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.860
 reduced only found I think that 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.110
 five different weapons at least 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.580
 primaries so it seems lost I think 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.110
 that maybe something a little more than sniper 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.400
 it's a little bit more of a category 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.680
 little bit of more accessories to make 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.660
 custom combinations and all that 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.400
 so also after this we're going 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.280
 to be looking at what the weapon is like 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.080
 such a politician is the long walk tmr you know 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.790
 we can obviously find it as a 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.780
 main weapon obviously and good 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.060
 we know we can unlock it 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.980
 through a certain level we know this one 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.510
 handles in this way comes out equally 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.890
 I think you forgot to say no 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.540
 accessories as charger 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.040
 I do not remember very well that others but 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.959
 good that there have to be some challenges 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.430
 to be able to unblock at the moment 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.319
 only I was using what 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.209
 was the sniper so original when you 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.160
 you take out later as you saw your 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.480
 moment with silencer and with water and in 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.650
 this moment is looking at what there is 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.140
 a little bit we do not have that it's a little bit 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:43.170
 like green the point of view is 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:45.780
 is the 4.5-inch view is a 4.5-zoom 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.250
 seem like it reduces a little bit the 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.810
 can tell the distance or the range to the 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.550
 which happens which one can point to 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.750
 so guys for now is what there is 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.100
 only known what a 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.450
 common nai but a weapon of this 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.700
 category really I think it paints 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.350
 for quite well I say we could not 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.180
 get to compare like a creek sniper 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.830
 d'or and I say apparently you do not notice that 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.940
 have for example the famous weeks caused 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.650
 at the moment you do not notice much 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.180
 especially because why be moved 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.620
 already mind does not have enough damage I say 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.870
 normally this weapon would be killing 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.340
 without silencer from one to two bullets 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.590
 really from a bullet depending the 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.150
 distance I see it quite complicated to 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.500
 unless you tell him in the head 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.970
 it really is a weapon in which you have 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.160
 very little damage and perhaps until 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.540
 let's find a better sniper maybe a 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.310
 bolt action sleeper like those that 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.230
 we know maybe you can get to see 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.660
 some quick shows some kind of 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.770
 similarity to what the call sniper is 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.660
 of duty so 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.190
 is what I wanted to talk a little bit about what 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.629
 that are the sniper maybe I saw him 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.979
 pretty future to what the community of 

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:37.319
 snipes I think there's going to be quite 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:38.849
 content or its great players such 

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:40.379
 to get clips or issues of 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:41.789
 this guy in this game so we 

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:43.169
 discuss who apart from what they 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:44.250
 you seem what is the sniper of 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:46.470
 At the moment I think there is not much to say 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.789
 I do not know much about it without 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.650
 But good because it paints pretty 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:50.909
 well for the little bit that is known like this 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.440
 that was the time now yes I already 

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:54.000
 dismissal peace I go wherever I want 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.069
 be and remember that I will not be 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.900
 watching until in a next video we 

00:04:56.069 --> 00:04:59.900
 we see later goodbye
