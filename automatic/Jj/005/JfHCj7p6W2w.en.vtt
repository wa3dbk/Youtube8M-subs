00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
I think they are interestingly doing

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.729 
I think they are interestingly doing
this<00:00:53.730> thing<00:00:53.940> at<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.180> start<00:00:54.420> line<00:00:54.480> again<00:00:54.899> but

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
this thing at the start line again but

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.569 
this thing at the start line again but
was<00:00:56.610> right<00:00:56.820> there<00:00:57.059> when<00:00:57.210> he<00:00:57.300> needed<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.570> be<00:00:58.579> may

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
was right there when he needed to be may

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.610 
was right there when he needed to be may
be<00:00:59.609> could<00:00:59.910> have<00:01:00.629> been<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.840> big<00:01:01.050> toll<00:01:01.260> sort<00:01:01.530> of

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
be could have been a big toll sort of

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.039 
be could have been a big toll sort of
the<00:01:01.739> tipping<00:01:02.399> point<00:01:02.430> there<00:01:02.820> but<00:01:03.329> nishida

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
the tipping point there but nishida

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.929 
the tipping point there but nishida
should<00:01:05.040> have<00:01:05.159> been<00:01:05.280> much<00:01:05.400> further<00:01:05.670> out<00:01:05.820> here

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
should have been much further out here

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.899 
should have been much further out here
had<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.360> good<00:01:06.780> half<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.140> car<00:01:07.350> more<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.830> go<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.729> day

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
it's an interesting one but I think the

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.710 
it's an interesting one but I think the
ball<00:01:15.720> is<00:01:15.930> in<00:01:15.960> jrs<00:01:16.409> cord<00:01:16.740> here<00:01:16.920> for<00:01:17.100> sure

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
up down it's been pretty low on the

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.179

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
scale overall yeah this was I think this

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.740 
scale overall yeah this was I think this
was<00:01:50.369> actually<00:01:50.549> his<00:01:50.790> best<00:01:51.060> qualifying<00:01:51.540> effort

clip<00:02:26.310> but<00:02:26.870> the<00:02:27.870> sheet<00:02:28.080> is<00:02:28.230> not<00:02:28.440> far<00:02:28.680> behind

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.620 
clip but the sheet is not far behind
again<00:02:29.400> only<00:02:29.720> two<00:02:30.720> or<00:02:30.930> three<00:02:31.170> car<00:02:31.530> lengths<00:02:31.920> away

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
again only two or three car lengths away

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.030 
again only two or three car lengths away
rounding<00:02:33.630> that<00:02:33.750> last<00:02:34.020> clipping<00:02:34.740> point<00:02:34.890> i

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
rounding that last clipping point i

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.440 
rounding that last clipping point i
think<00:02:35.070> it<00:02:35.280> was<00:02:35.340> closer<00:02:35.580> to<00:02:35.700> one<00:02:35.970> car<00:02:36.270> length

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
think it was closer to one car length

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.200 
think it was closer to one car length
away<00:02:36.630> I<00:02:37.020> was<00:02:37.440> expecting<00:02:37.980> Daryl<00:02:38.670> to<00:02:38.790> get<00:02:38.940> away<00:02:39.060> a

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
away I was expecting Daryl to get away a

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.660 
away I was expecting Daryl to get away a
little<00:02:39.450> bit<00:02:39.680> but<00:02:40.680> I<00:02:40.710> think<00:02:41.160> he<00:02:41.220> definitely<00:02:41.370> got

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
little bit but I think he definitely got

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.140 
little bit but I think he definitely got
away<00:02:41.910> a<00:02:41.940> bit<00:02:42.150> here<00:02:42.450> from<00:02:42.630> the<00:02:42.720> start

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
away a bit here from the start

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.220 
away a bit here from the start
definitely<00:02:45.150> has<00:02:45.240> a<00:02:45.270> Carly<00:02:45.630> there<00:02:45.780> Robbie<00:02:46.050> is

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
definitely has a Carly there Robbie is

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.100 
definitely has a Carly there Robbie is
playing<00:02:46.590> catch-up<00:02:46.830> here<00:02:47.390> but<00:02:48.390> does<00:02:48.870> a<00:02:48.930> great

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
playing catch-up here but does a great

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.650 
playing catch-up here but does a great
job<00:02:49.140> of<00:02:49.380> it<00:02:50.570> gets<00:02:51.570> back<00:02:51.750> on<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:51.930> power<00:02:53.330> and<00:02:54.330> the

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
job of it gets back on the power and the

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.590 
job of it gets back on the power and the
jrs<00:02:55.650> lying<00:02:55.920> again<00:02:56.190> is<00:02:56.310> as<00:02:56.970> awesome<00:02:57.120> as<00:02:57.480> usual

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
jrs lying again is as awesome as usual

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.380 
jrs lying again is as awesome as usual
Robbie<00:02:58.170> is<00:02:58.410> right<00:02:59.010> there<00:02:59.250> you<00:02:59.490> know<00:02:59.610> Robbie

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
Robbie is right there you know Robbie

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.660 
Robbie is right there you know Robbie
was<00:03:00.660> much<00:03:00.870> shallower<00:03:01.290> in<00:03:01.620> that<00:03:01.770> that<00:03:02.130> second

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
was much shallower in that that second

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.040 
was much shallower in that that second
outside<00:03:02.820> clipping<00:03:03.420> zone<00:03:03.630> when<00:03:03.810> he<00:03:03.840> was

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
outside clipping zone when he was

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.810 
outside clipping zone when he was
leading<00:03:04.290> white<00:03:04.860> shadow<00:03:04.890> here<00:03:05.430> too<00:03:05.640> I<00:03:05.670> think

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
leading white shadow here too I think

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.400 
leading white shadow here too I think
Rami<00:03:06.120> makes<00:03:06.330> a<00:03:06.420> little<00:03:06.540> mistake<00:03:06.690> here<00:03:06.930> it's

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
Rami makes a little mistake here it's

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:08.780 
Rami makes a little mistake here it's
lost<00:03:07.620> in<00:03:07.770> the<00:03:07.830> small<00:03:08.010> transitions<00:03:08.490> if<00:03:08.580> it<00:03:08.670> only

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
lost in the small transitions if it only

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.300 
lost in the small transitions if it only
ends<00:03:09.090> up<00:03:09.150> going<00:03:09.330> very<00:03:09.990> wide<00:03:10.380> here<00:03:10.410> yeah<00:03:11.010> and

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
ends up going very wide here yeah and

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.520 
ends up going very wide here yeah and
actually<00:03:11.490> clips<00:03:11.970> the<00:03:12.180> finish<00:03:12.570> line<00:03:12.810> if<00:03:13.140> I<00:03:13.350> can

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
actually clips the finish line if I can

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.550 
actually clips the finish line if I can
see<00:03:13.650> it<00:03:13.770> at<00:03:13.860> the<00:03:13.890> calamari<00:03:14.840> so<00:03:15.840> hard<00:03:16.290> to<00:03:16.380> see

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
see it at the calamari so hard to see

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.280 
see it at the calamari so hard to see
through<00:03:16.739> all<00:03:16.860> the<00:03:17.010> smoke<00:03:17.270> bond<00:03:18.270> game<00:03:18.570> Jr<00:03:19.110> gets

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
through all the smoke bond game Jr gets

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.140 
through all the smoke bond game Jr gets
the<00:03:19.560> win<00:03:19.739> that's<00:03:20.310> the<00:03:20.459> correct<00:03:20.670> call<00:03:20.940> I<00:03:20.970> think

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
the win that's the correct call I think

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.900 
the win that's the correct call I think
so
