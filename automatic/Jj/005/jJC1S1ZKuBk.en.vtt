and<00:00:22.289> they're<00:00:22.470> fierce<00:00:22.769> oh<00:00:22.859> they're<00:00:22.980> really

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
and they're fierce oh they're really

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.370 
and they're fierce oh they're really
unique<00:00:23.430> interesting<00:00:24.180> looking<00:00:24.420> heads<00:00:24.720> which

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
unique interesting looking heads which

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.439 
unique interesting looking heads which
are<00:00:25.500> kind<00:00:25.710> of<00:00:25.769> funny<00:00:26.490> shaped<00:00:26.820> in<00:00:26.970> comparison

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
are kind of funny shaped in comparison

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.540 
are kind of funny shaped in comparison
to<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.599> lot<00:00:27.720> of<00:00:27.750> other<00:00:27.960> Python<00:00:28.260> species<00:00:28.890> that's

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
to a lot of other Python species that's

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.849 
to a lot of other Python species that's
because<00:00:29.789> they<00:00:29.939> lack<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.320> labial<00:00:31.320> pits<00:00:31.590> or

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
because they lack the labial pits or

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.010 
because they lack the labial pits or
heat-sensing<00:00:32.550> pits<00:00:32.579> most<00:00:33.210> Python<00:00:33.600> species

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
heat-sensing pits most Python species

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.440 
heat-sensing pits most Python species
used<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.380> target<00:00:34.710> their<00:00:34.860> prey<00:00:35.149> these<00:00:36.149> guys<00:00:36.300> are

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
used to target their prey these guys are

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.970 
used to target their prey these guys are
really<00:00:36.570> opportunistic<00:00:37.320> feeders<00:00:37.620> out<00:00:37.800> in<00:00:37.920> the

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
really opportunistic feeders out in the

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.549 
really opportunistic feeders out in the
scrublands<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:38.760> when<00:00:39.690> they<00:00:39.809> pick<00:00:40.020> up<00:00:40.050> on<00:00:40.320> prey

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
scrublands and when they pick up on prey

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.049 
scrublands and when they pick up on prey
a<00:00:40.770> lot<00:00:40.950> of<00:00:41.010> times<00:00:41.190> it's<00:00:41.370> lizards<00:00:41.730> so<00:00:41.969> they

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
a lot of times it's lizards so they

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.729 
a lot of times it's lizards so they
don't<00:00:42.180> necessarily<00:00:42.300> need<00:00:42.899> heat-sensing<00:00:43.710> pits

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
don't necessarily need heat-sensing pits

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.470 
don't necessarily need heat-sensing pits
in<00:00:44.160> order<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:44.550> grab<00:00:44.730> something<00:00:45.149> that's<00:00:45.300> full

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
in order to grab something that's full

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.500 
in order to grab something that's full
blooded<00:00:45.690> like<00:00:45.960> they<00:00:46.110> are<00:00:46.969> these<00:00:47.969> guys<00:00:48.180> live<00:00:48.480> in

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
blooded like they are these guys live in

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.569 
blooded like they are these guys live in
the<00:00:48.690> Australian<00:00:49.320> desert<00:00:49.500> they're<00:00:50.039> not<00:00:50.250> sold

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
the Australian desert they're not sold

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.490 
the Australian desert they're not sold
on<00:00:50.700> scene<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.300> something<00:00:51.899> really<00:00:52.140> neat<00:00:52.289> about

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
on scene and something really neat about

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.750 
on scene and something really neat about
them<00:00:52.649> that<00:00:52.829> kind<00:00:52.980> of<00:00:53.070> sets<00:00:53.280> them<00:00:53.430> apart<00:00:53.520> from

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
them that kind of sets them apart from

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.459 
them that kind of sets them apart from
other<00:00:53.969> pythons<00:00:54.510> as<00:00:54.719> they're<00:00:54.870> actually<00:00:55.170> noni

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
other pythons as they're actually noni

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.260 
other pythons as they're actually noni
today<00:00:55.800> so<00:00:56.430> these<00:00:56.670> black<00:00:56.910> heads<00:00:57.120> especially

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
today so these black heads especially

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.930 
today so these black heads especially
will<00:00:57.870> burrow<00:00:58.289> underground<00:00:58.739> during<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.550> day

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
will burrow underground during the day

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.650 
will burrow underground during the day
and<00:01:00.239> escape<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.780> heat<00:01:01.640> yeah<00:01:02.640> these<00:01:02.879> guys<00:01:03.090> live

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
and escape the heat yeah these guys live

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.240 
and escape the heat yeah these guys live
in<00:01:03.780> some<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.019> least<00:01:04.199> inhabited<00:01:04.739> places<00:01:04.949> on

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
in some the least inhabited places on

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.420 
in some the least inhabited places on
earth

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
earth

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.280 
earth
so<00:01:05.700> they<00:01:05.970> not<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.330> lot<00:01:06.540> was<00:01:06.659> known<00:01:06.720> about<00:01:07.049> them

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
so they not a lot was known about them

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.260 
so they not a lot was known about them
until<00:01:07.439> fairly<00:01:07.770> recently<00:01:07.920> but<00:01:08.700> we<00:01:08.850> really

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
until fairly recently but we really

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.660 
until fairly recently but we really
really<00:01:09.510> like<00:01:09.659> these<00:01:09.810> species<00:01:10.670> they're

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
really like these species they're

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.590 
really like these species they're
actually<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.090> fairly<00:01:12.270> manageable

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
actually a fairly manageable

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.870 
actually a fairly manageable
medium-sized<00:01:13.260> Python<00:01:13.770> at<00:01:13.979> least<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.220> Woma<00:01:14.369> it's

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
medium-sized Python at least a Woma it's

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.429 
medium-sized Python at least a Woma it's
about<00:01:15.000> five<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.420> six<00:01:15.600> feet<00:01:15.720> this<00:01:16.020> guy's<00:01:16.200> about

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
about five to six feet this guy's about

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.590 
about five to six feet this guy's about
six<00:01:16.790> black<00:01:17.790> it<00:01:18.000> does<00:01:18.210> get<00:01:18.330> a<00:01:18.390> little<00:01:18.479> bit

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
six black it does get a little bit

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.240 
six black it does get a little bit
bigger<00:01:18.810> they<00:01:19.020> average<00:01:19.350> about<00:01:19.530> six<00:01:19.799> feet<00:01:20.009> but

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
bigger they average about six feet but

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.850 
bigger they average about six feet but
specimens<00:01:20.820> are<00:01:20.939> recorded<00:01:21.270> up<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.450> nine<00:01:21.860> and

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
specimens are recorded up to nine and

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.830 
specimens are recorded up to nine and
they<00:01:23.009> are<00:01:23.159> powerful<00:01:23.610> animals<00:01:23.970> I<00:01:24.390> mean<00:01:24.570> they're

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
they are powerful animals I mean they're

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.999 
they are powerful animals I mean they're
pretty<00:01:25.049> strong<00:01:25.290> with<00:01:25.530> their<00:01:25.650> body<00:01:25.830> length

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
pretty strong with their body length

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.260 
pretty strong with their body length
they<00:01:26.220> can<00:01:26.369> dig<00:01:26.580> with<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.909> upper<00:01:27.090> part<00:01:27.240> of

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
they can dig with the upper part of

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.730 
they can dig with the upper part of
their<00:01:27.390> body<00:01:27.570> so<00:01:27.780> you're<00:01:27.900> gonna<00:01:28.020> need<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.290> strong

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
their body so you're gonna need a strong

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.499 
their body so you're gonna need a strong
enclosure<00:01:29.189> that's<00:01:29.670> about<00:01:29.909> half<00:01:30.180> of<00:01:30.329> their

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
enclosure that's about half of their

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:31.999 
enclosure that's about half of their
body<00:01:30.689> length<00:01:30.900> usually<00:01:31.320> about<00:01:31.470> three<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:31.829> four

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
body length usually about three to four

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.130 
body length usually about three to four
feet<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.640> we<00:01:33.390> recommend<00:01:33.659> that<00:01:33.810> they<00:01:33.960> have<00:01:34.110> a

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
feet and we recommend that they have a

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.649 
feet and we recommend that they have a
