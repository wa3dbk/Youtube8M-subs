00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:11.360
 in my beloved 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:13.670
 And then I'll show you this one. 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.200
 rangers simple cabin that 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.860
 we just installed two accessories 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:21.949
 much sought after for her here which is the 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.900
 bucket top as 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:28.160
 open here let's talk first of 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:32.540
 sea cape here 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:34.580
 is top of the line that comes out original in 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:38.089
 assembly line it comes with the globe 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:40.699
 here rangers wrote and this hood she 

00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:44.360
 has several details of good quality 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:47.449
 in it she has her stitching double she 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:52.339
 has the reinforcement in the closed system of 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:53.180
 opening it is pretty cool the prec system 

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:55.879
 indicator 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:01:00.229
 she has this lever here, the people 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:03.350
 move it pulls a steel cable and the 

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:05.299
 releases the side opening of it here 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.950
 Also notice that the singer was hers is 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:10.100
 100% in aluminum 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.799
 is not that hollow aluminum that part 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:17.329
 hedda fit right when you 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:20.149
 does he already do the treatment 

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:23.060
 Let's open here again to show that 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:27.170
 We already showed her the back trek of 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:29.210
 100% aluminum is used here. 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.250
 just for this part here 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.259
 in some with some manufacturers not 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.880
 place this reinforcement that happens when 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:36.710
 they are going to make this close 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.109
 here is the place that makes the greatest effort 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.719
 on the canvas if you do not have this reinforcement here 

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:44.329
 This part here the little time is over. 

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:46.609
 Turan discs ripping and a 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:49.549
 differential of this quota also the lateral 

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:52.520
 has a baguette system that ss 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:56.210
 Rubber that enters inside the 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.960
 aluminum structure within the 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.600
 structure 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.210
 also see that the hood has everything 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.399
 in contact is rubbery in that part 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.530
 that have contact with the bucket is 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:08.869
 does not drill a hole in the 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.780
 bucket because that is the agents 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.260
 the clips the hooks that make the 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.099
 fixation 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.720
 aluminum culture in the bucket are this 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.650
 pickup that as a cabin pickup 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.590
 simple 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.239
 it has four on each side normally 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.760
 the simple cabin pickups use 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.250
 four and the double cabins use three 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.810
 on each side 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:34.760
 it also has this crossbar 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:36.870
 It is very important to never leave without 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.790
 these bars are good for 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.459
 Stretch canvas to leave it in forever 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.549
 well stretched in a possible rain a 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:47.250
 time to water ends up accumulating everything 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:49.769
 this part of the canvas and if you do not have 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:53.190
 bars to keep the canvas tight 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:55.500
 student ends up sinking and destroying all 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.970
 the hood structure 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:02.060
 so these brands here are pretty simple 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:03.530
 to remove you give it a beat 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.430
 which will allow is better 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.569
 positioning it fits into the frame 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.290
 aluminum 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:15.110
 That's what the movie showed was legal. 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:18.080
 so in this case here are three bars 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:21.950
 and air and using a double cabin 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:25.040
 she also has these elastics that 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:28.010
 elastic fit which are the elastic 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:31.880
 for when you wind all the canvas you 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:35.049
 wrap and fasten a front elastic 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:38.840
 we also installed the bucket protector 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:45.290
 bucket protects here at the edge of 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:49.430
 cover faces outline that tackles right 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:54.019
 with writing arranges holds the hooks 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:57.290
 the original does not remove a hook keeps 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:59.510
 them and makes perfect fit making the 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:02.840
 bucket outline 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:05.989
 following the right bucket line and 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.640
 at the time of closing the hood is well 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:10.670
 simple to close 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:13.370
 first of all we recommend the 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:15.410
 manufacturer recommends that you first 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.079
 back 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:20.959
 first you close the back after 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:24.520
 You're closing with side baguette. 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:28.100
 this makes it easy to close and also 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:31.039
 help in the life of the student ends 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:33.680
 forcing and the hood makes the contour 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:37.400
 right of the bucket 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:42.530
 The canvas structure is rounded. 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:43.840
 outline follows the lines of the 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:48.160
 bucket 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:51.560
 and that's it we finish another service 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:55.250
 well installed the average time of 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:57.980
 installation here one hour of service 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:59.510
 the installer clinging to the car and need 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:02.000
 an hour to install the 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:04.430
 marine cap bucket 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.900
 This is it people, if they liked the video
