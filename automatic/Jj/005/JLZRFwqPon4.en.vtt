00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:06.180
 I never used to go to the calendar 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.740
 and disney you are interested but 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.469
 I have to admit with lego 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.670
 Dimensions has me this game principle 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:13.139
 somehow caught because I had 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.690
 at warner today exclusively the 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.340
 opportunity to look at the game 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.859
 to convince myself in the 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.410
 startup corner gets her batman gandalf 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.390
 Wildstar from Lego movie The Batmobile 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.529
 So also all the car and that is 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.170
 For example, already redial ego 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.939
 dimensions and of course you have something 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.710
 you need to use your figures 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.270
 to play at the lego even secures 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.980
 not so much changed so 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.079
 the classical elements the kenians 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.579
 I share myself with the others 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.989
 asked was directly first what 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.820
 Do I do that when I start this starter 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.440
 I can really have characters 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.050
 I have to solve everything or actually have to 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.420
 Buy figures to the standard pose 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.550
 you do not have to solve that means that 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.840
 who comes through with this starterset 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.760
 but you can do the whole game 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.530
 next to it figures to buy 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.180
 which give you another level of the ones 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.039
 other vehicles give you these 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.719
 other possibilities give me something 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.399
 the people most surprised 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.920
 was that the game has done the 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.530
 It implies that there is 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.000
 basels where i eg from a portal into 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.350
 the next one has to go in the game 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.880
 but you can not do it yourself 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.189
 solve with the help of the harp 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.750
 there are three areas once the 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.009
 Middle area then left an area 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.119
 for three figures one area on the right 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.799
 for three figures and that can be in 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.270
 different colors light up 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.580
 which means me for example 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.350
 for the green portal only with the figure 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.150
 in the green area and then 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.920
 for the orange portal the figure in the 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.049
 oranges in the field of motion and zack bin 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.189
 I went through the portal in the game 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.619
 that's just one of several 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.869
 basel possibilities one can in some 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.610
 level different possibilities 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.930
 for've set there for 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.329
 For example, the puzzle with itself 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.860
 let solve color pots and there goes 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.200
 it's about the colors on the h 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.820
 are displayed 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.140
 you can also have vehicles 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.939
 then bring you into the game 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.070
 use different sequences 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:54.439
 you can and you can and that is new 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.329
 upgrade for the first time that is 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:58.460
 and that it typically you take for lego 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:00.110
 the whole thing just apart and 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.939
 matching together and suddenly has 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.590
 The vehicle I find new skills 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:05.509
 the feature is definitely pretty 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.100
 cool and definitely fits everyone 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:09.500
 who used to play with lego 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.299
 has my absolute favorite place 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.860
 However, investors still have one 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:14.959
 completely different thing and that's it 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.489
 for the first time a lego game that 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.840
 I'm not just referring to a movie 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.910
 but that it's similar to lego 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.440
 movie and involves many franchise with 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.150
 a meaning it also leaves room 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.709
 to bring figures into the universe 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.670
 of which one would not have thought before 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.819
 that they are there 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.980
 I was extremely surprised , for example 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:33.049
 suddenly signs had to stand yes 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.970
 Quite out of partl I could do the portal 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:37.370
 bring in my lego dimensions and 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.660
 There is even board level in the clear 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.680
 but even with me does not speak 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.950
 can shoot portals 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.690
 that's just fucking cool as well 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.670
 is there still the simpsons still needs 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.290
 gives a simpsons level and you have 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.450
 even scooby doo in a cel shading 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.980
 world so the individual levels are not 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.690
 just typical in the lego style we look for 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.459
 know the games but change them 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.819
 There is a line in your doctor 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:00.170
 puzzles in your idea completely off that 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:01.489
 what was me of lego dimensions 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.019
 convinced and I am pleased 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:04.910
 insane that things 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:06.709
 to try it out and I almost believe it 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.690
 take these 100 euro actually in the 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.340
 hand to get me the starter pack 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.329
 I like to tell in the comments if 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.329
 you also have it on it
