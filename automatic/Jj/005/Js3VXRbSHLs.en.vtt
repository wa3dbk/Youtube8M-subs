00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
cut that off to the limb for once as I

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.149 
cut that off to the limb for once as I
say<00:01:18.960> I've<00:01:19.049> got<00:01:19.229> this<00:01:19.350> about<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.650> millimeter

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
say I've got this about a millimeter

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.460 
say I've got this about a millimeter
smaller<00:01:21.000> than<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.479> thickness<00:01:21.509> of<00:01:21.869> wood<00:01:22.049> so

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
smaller than the thickness of wood so

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.520 
smaller than the thickness of wood so
that<00:01:22.710> it<00:01:22.799> fits<00:01:23.729> really<00:01:23.909> tight<00:01:24.259> see<00:01:25.259> I'll<00:01:25.380> just

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
that it fits really tight see I'll just

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.260 
that it fits really tight see I'll just
knock<00:01:25.740> it<00:01:25.770> on<00:01:26.009> as<00:01:26.220> I<00:01:26.400> say<00:01:26.580> this<00:01:26.880> would<00:01:27.060> be<00:01:27.240> a

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
knock it on as I say this would be a

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.330 
knock it on as I say this would be a
nice<00:01:27.960> melee<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.439> something<00:01:28.860> like<00:01:28.979> 18

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
nice melee to something like 18

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.620

millimeter<00:01:29.820> alley<00:01:30.090> or<00:01:30.270> something<00:01:32.329> so<00:01:33.329> there

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
millimeter alley or something so there

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.460

so<00:01:47.579> I'm<00:01:47.759> going<00:01:47.939> to<00:01:48.000> glue<00:01:48.060> together<00:01:48.470> below<00:01:49.470> ran

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
so I'm going to glue together below ran

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:50.960 
so I'm going to glue together below ran
the<00:01:50.130> edges<00:01:50.369> off<00:01:50.490> slightly

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
the edges off slightly
