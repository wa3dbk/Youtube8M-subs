00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:18.380 
your pattern the technique is the same

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.560 
your pattern the technique is the same
regardless<00:00:19.070> of<00:00:19.430> how<00:00:19.760> big<00:00:20.030> you<00:00:20.210> need<00:00:20.360> to<00:00:20.420> make

regardless of how big you need to make
the<00:00:20.690> buttonhole<00:00:21.140> but<00:00:21.560> you'll<00:00:21.680> need<00:00:21.830> to<00:00:21.890> follow

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 
the buttonhole but you'll need to follow

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.450 
the buttonhole but you'll need to follow
the<00:00:22.430> pattern<00:00:22.640> and<00:00:23.380> using<00:00:24.380> your<00:00:24.470> gauge<00:00:24.830> and<00:00:24.860> the

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 
the pattern and using your gauge and the

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:26.950 
the pattern and using your gauge and the
size<00:00:25.700> of<00:00:25.880> button<00:00:26.150> you<00:00:26.270> want<00:00:26.390> to<00:00:26.540> use<00:00:26.600> to

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
size of button you want to use to

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.269

to<00:00:28.430> bind<00:00:28.640> off<00:00:28.910> let<00:00:29.660> me<00:00:29.750> show<00:00:29.930> you<00:00:29.990> how<00:00:30.200> this

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
to bind off let me show you how this

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.830 
to bind off let me show you how this
goes<00:00:30.520> so<00:00:31.520> I'm<00:00:31.789> going<00:00:32.059> to<00:00:32.180> put<00:00:32.330> a<00:00:32.360> buttonhole

off another one now I've bound off two
stitches<00:00:47.809> remember<00:00:48.559> when<00:00:48.710> you're<00:00:48.830> binding

knit<00:00:56.360> across<00:00:56.449> to<00:00:56.900> the<00:00:57.019> end<00:00:58.720> so<00:00:59.720> that<00:00:59.870> I<00:00:59.900> can<00:01:00.140> get

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
knit across to the end so that I can get

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:12.360 
knit across to the end so that I can get
back<00:01:00.680> on<00:01:00.920> to<00:01:01.070> the<00:01:01.190> wrong<00:01:01.400> side

okay now the second row of the

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:24.870 
okay now the second row of the
buttonhole<00:01:16.300> is<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.920> final<00:01:18.310> row<00:01:21.570> oops<00:01:23.880> my

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
buttonhole is the final row oops my

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.700 
buttonhole is the final row oops my
needles<00:01:25.210> are<00:01:25.330> clucking<00:01:25.870> against<00:01:26.080> the<00:01:26.230> table

I'm<00:01:29.710> going<00:01:30.190> to<00:01:30.310> work<00:01:30.580> up<00:01:30.880> in<00:01:31.120> this<00:01:31.240> case<00:01:31.480> I'm

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:31.660 
I'm going to work up in this case I'm

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:39.600 
I'm going to work up in this case I'm
purling<00:01:34.320> work<00:01:35.320> up<00:01:35.500> to<00:01:35.710> the<00:01:35.830> gap<00:01:38.280> where<00:01:39.280> I<00:01:39.310> bound

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
purling work up to the gap where I bound

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.270 
purling work up to the gap where I bound
off<00:01:39.820> those<00:01:40.030> two<00:01:40.270> stitches<00:01:40.540> Here<00:01:41.050> I<00:01:41.080> am<00:01:41.170> big<00:01:42.010> gap

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
off those two stitches Here I am big gap

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.050 
off those two stitches Here I am big gap
here<00:01:42.310> now<00:01:44.310> based<00:01:45.310> on<00:01:45.490> the<00:01:45.580> number<00:01:45.790> of<00:01:45.820> stitches

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
here now based on the number of stitches

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.760 
here now based on the number of stitches
that<00:01:46.210> you<00:01:46.360> bound<00:01:46.630> off<00:01:46.930> you're<00:01:47.230> going<00:01:47.350> to<00:01:47.500> cast

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
that you bound off you're going to cast

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.340 
that you bound off you're going to cast
on<00:01:48.070> stitches<00:01:48.910> here<00:01:49.330> since<00:01:49.600> I<00:01:49.720> bound<00:01:49.930> off<00:01:50.110> to

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
on stitches here since I bound off to

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.430 
on stitches here since I bound off to
I'm<00:01:50.440> going<00:01:50.530> to<00:01:50.590> cast<00:01:50.770> on<00:01:51.070> to<00:01:52.320> using<00:01:53.320> the

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
I'm going to cast on to using the

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.470 
I'm going to cast on to using the
backwards<00:01:53.860> loop<00:01:54.040> cast<00:01:54.100> on<00:01:54.520> method<00:01:57.120> so<00:01:58.120> I<00:01:58.180> cast

00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:58.480 
backwards loop cast on method so I cast

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.990 
backwards loop cast on method so I cast
on<00:01:58.630> two<00:01:58.900> and<00:01:59.200> I<00:01:59.980> work<00:02:00.160> across<00:02:00.430> the<00:02:00.700> rest<00:02:00.880> of<00:02:00.940> the

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
on two and I work across the rest of the

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.520 
on two and I work across the rest of the
row<00:02:01.150> and<00:02:04.860> then<00:02:05.860> from<00:02:06.070> here<00:02:06.100> on<00:02:06.400> out

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
row and then from here on out

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.210 
row and then from here on out
you're<00:02:08.530> just<00:02:08.619> going<00:02:08.800> to<00:02:08.860> follow<00:02:09.040> the

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
you're just going to follow the

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.760 
you're just going to follow the
direction<00:02:09.369> just<00:02:09.820> to<00:02:10.030> work<00:02:10.240> the<00:02:10.570> pattern<00:02:11.560> as

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
direction just to work the pattern as

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.700 
direction just to work the pattern as
usual<00:02:12.760> and<00:02:13.030> you're<00:02:13.330> going<00:02:13.540> to<00:02:13.690> work<00:02:14.440> those

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
usual and you're going to work those

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.340 
usual and you're going to work those
stitches<00:02:15.370> you<00:02:15.640> just<00:02:15.850> cast<00:02:16.060> on<00:02:16.330> as<00:02:16.600> usual<00:02:16.900> and

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
stitches you just cast on as usual and

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.500 
stitches you just cast on as usual and
you're<00:02:17.680> left<00:02:17.950> with<00:02:18.370> a<00:02:18.550> nice<00:02:18.730> buttonhole<00:02:19.300> there

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
you're left with a nice buttonhole there

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.290 
you're left with a nice buttonhole there
and<00:02:19.860> with<00:02:20.860> my<00:02:21.070> gauge<00:02:21.340> and<00:02:21.610> two<00:02:21.760> stitches<00:02:22.180> it

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
and with my gauge and two stitches it

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.920 
and with my gauge and two stitches it
looks<00:02:22.480> like<00:02:22.630> that<00:02:22.780> would<00:02:22.870> probably

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
looks like that would probably

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.020 
looks like that would probably
accommodate<00:02:23.500> like<00:02:23.830> a<00:02:23.880> three-quarter<00:02:24.880> inch

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
accommodate like a three-quarter inch

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.180 
accommodate like a three-quarter inch
buttonhole<00:02:25.450> or<00:02:25.600> something<00:02:25.959> and<00:02:26.200> that's<00:02:26.980> how

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
buttonhole or something and that's how
