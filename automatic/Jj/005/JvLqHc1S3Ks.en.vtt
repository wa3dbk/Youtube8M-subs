defending<00:01:35.400> by<00:01:35.490> one<00:01:35.700> passing<00:01:36.090> by<00:01:36.180> one<00:01:36.360> heading

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
defending by one passing by one heading

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.450

up<00:01:36.810> by<00:01:36.990> free<00:01:37.350> it's<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.799> good<00:01:37.979> shot<00:01:38.189> for<00:01:38.369> him

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
maybe to go down to a silver but I think

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.350

think it was our second most amount of
headers<00:03:06.299> behind<00:03:06.599> you<00:03:06.719> which<00:03:07.139> I<00:03:07.319> mean<00:03:07.469> for<00:03:07.650> a

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
right back is very impressive so on to

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:11.869 
right back is very impressive so on to
the<00:03:10.200> next<00:03:10.379> guy<00:03:10.620> and<00:03:10.859> that<00:03:10.950> is<00:03:11.040> Michael<00:03:11.430> Dawson

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:11.879 
the next guy and that is Michael Dawson

another one that a lot of comments were

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.140 
another one that a lot of comments were
saying<00:03:13.799> he<00:03:13.950> should<00:03:14.189> be<00:03:14.310> downgraded<00:03:14.909> he<00:03:15.060> has

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
saying he should be downgraded he has

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.199 
saying he should be downgraded he has
gone<00:03:15.299> down<00:03:15.480> from<00:03:15.659> 79<00:03:16.049> to<00:03:16.200> 76<00:03:17.159> knocked<00:03:17.849> his<00:03:18.000> pace

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
gone down from 79 to 76 knocked his pace

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.000 
gone down from 79 to 76 knocked his pace
down<00:03:18.479> by<00:03:18.780> for<00:03:19.139> his<00:03:19.260> dribbling<00:03:19.590> number<00:03:19.859> one

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
down by for his dribbling number one

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.979 
down by for his dribbling number one
shooting<00:03:20.280> down<00:03:20.459> by<00:03:20.609> one<00:03:20.819> defending<00:03:21.569> down<00:03:21.780> by

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
shooting down by one defending down by

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.140 
shooting down by one defending down by
four<00:03:22.349> passing<00:03:23.010> down<00:03:23.159> by<00:03:23.310> one<00:03:23.489> and<00:03:23.669> heading

four passing down by one and heading

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.539 
four passing down by one and heading
down<00:03:24.299> by<00:03:25.019> four<00:03:25.500> I<00:03:25.530> think<00:03:25.709> the<00:03:25.949> pace<00:03:26.159> is<00:03:26.370> one

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
down by four I think the pace is one

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:27.770 
down by four I think the pace is one
that's<00:03:26.729> kind<00:03:27.000> of<00:03:27.060> important<00:03:27.510> because<00:03:27.599> he's

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
that's kind of important because he's

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.390 
that's kind of important because he's
getting<00:03:28.049> older<00:03:28.290> and<00:03:28.409> older<00:03:28.500> so<00:03:29.040> that<00:03:29.189> pace

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
getting older and older so that pace

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.969 
getting older and older so that pace
does<00:03:29.729> kind<00:03:30.030> of<00:03:30.120> deservedly<00:03:30.599> go<00:03:30.989> down<00:03:31.290> like<00:03:31.859> i

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:31.979 
does kind of deservedly go down like i

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:32.780 
does kind of deservedly go down like i

then<00:03:42.689> I<00:03:42.750> kind<00:03:43.019> of<00:03:43.109> feel<00:03:43.290> like<00:03:43.349> it's<00:03:43.949> not<00:03:44.159> just

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
then I kind of feel like it's not just

then I kind of feel like it's not just
going<00:03:44.489> to<00:03:44.549> be<00:03:44.639> a<00:03:44.669> last<00:03:44.939> one<00:03:45.150> fan<00:03:45.329> saying<00:03:45.629> that

00:04:41.839 --> 00:04:41.849 
he got a single assists this season so

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:42.950 
he got a single assists this season so
there's<00:04:42.000> no<00:04:42.120> way<00:04:42.270> you<00:04:42.330> can<00:04:42.479> give<00:04:42.659> him<00:04:42.780> a

there's no way you can give him a
passing<00:04:43.590> off<00:04:43.770> for<00:04:44.099> but<00:04:44.219> anyway<00:04:44.430> on<00:04:44.610> to<00:04:44.669> the

perhaps<00:04:52.680> I<00:04:52.949> could<00:04:53.009> have<00:04:53.219> done<00:04:53.340> a<00:04:53.370> little<00:04:53.550> bit

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:53.729 
perhaps I could have done a little bit

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:55.279 
perhaps I could have done a little bit
more<00:04:53.879> than<00:04:54.060> 2<00:04:54.240> i'm<00:04:54.419> not<00:04:54.629> too<00:04:54.780> sure<00:04:54.810> but<00:04:55.080> this<00:04:55.199> is
