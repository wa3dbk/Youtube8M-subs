00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.920
 hello very good welcome to the channel a 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:18.279
 day more and today I 'm finally going to the video 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:21.789
 of how I made the curtains with the 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:24.850
 machine that you see here the rags are from 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:27.610
 I have them tuned for a 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:30.190
 a video where we are going to see some 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:32.140
 tricks some things like power 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:35.030
 make more cool and more appropriate to the 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:39.890
 decoration we have 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:42.350
 nothing that starts the video of how you see 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.670
 the curtains step by step is in several 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.350
 days because I have not done it in a day 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.660
 because you already know that I time 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.250
 I have very limited but good what 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.239
 promised is debt and here you have the 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.239
 video 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:59.930
 The first thing we are going to do is take the 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.660
 hem both from the sides as 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:06.020
 the top and bottom of the 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:08.150
 curtains for it as nothing a couple of 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.930
 pins and the tape measure we will take 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:14.090
 two centimeters both from the sides 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.650
 with an up and down api from above 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.170
 always of course we will give a little more 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.390
 so that we can pass the bar and 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.990
 you can simply 6 dial with the 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:27.460
 pin holding it 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:30.820
 so that it looks good in 22 centimeters and 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:33.580
 after marking the entire curtain 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:39.430
 these two centimeters then we will go to 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:42.250
 sew it after passing it through the 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.890
 machine what we will proceed will line up 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:50.380
 obviously the pins that we have 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:52.240
 let the next step we take the 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.240
 piquÃ© tape that we have that we have 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:58.780
 chosen the ribbon that we choose and we go 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.729
 to put along the curtain of 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.890
 piece that we have used here as 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.200
 you can see we are placing what I have 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.909
 given with the pins along 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.660
 all the kitchen to be able to go through the 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:14.250
 sewing machine and singing also what 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.959
 we have caught with the pin 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.630
 as you could see the tape the 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.819
 I put on top of the fabric not that 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:25.060
 excel because I like the design more 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:27.340
 that is above the fabric and now 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.770
 already directly because we go to the 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.690
 sewing machine to start sewing the 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.030
 that we will use from the top 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.130
 because the bottom of the covers 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.560
 from below that does not remain in loose 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.420
 open then well you can see there 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.739
 going to the machine for the part 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.739
 top to hold it 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:56.550
 and on this side what I 'm doing is 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:59.070
 sew the edge pass the machine and when 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.740
 I come to the end I give back to 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:03.480
 that remain more subscribed and we're going to 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.750
 do both on one side and on the other 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.750
 side 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.950
 and here you can see what I said to you 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.260
 that part is totally open not 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.720
 it is closed 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.880
 the third step and then we're going to 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:26.780
 put the other appointment in this case I chose the 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:28.970
 piece of a piece of topics and I'm going to 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:32.750
 put over the piquet tape 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.610
 to cover where we see his sewing of this 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.670
 way well, I like it better 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:40.100
 that we are going to reduce a little the 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:44.300
 thickness that has 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:46.990
 in this case the piece the width of this 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:50.210
 fabric equals about seven centimeters 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:54.190
 so what I want to do is 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:57.890
 helping me with the pins make a 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:04:00.110
 fold a half centimeter both 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.410
 with the top part as for the part 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.410
 down 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.750
 once caught the doubles in the tape of 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:36.139
 moles what we are going to do is put it 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:38.570
 above the piquet tape for 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:41.810
 we need a pins and what 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:46.270
 let's hold once subject what 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.270
 we will pass to sew and they will be ready 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:11.110
 and this time we will see things 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:38.080
 both the top and the 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:40.390
 bottom good you've seen what 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:43.210
 easy that is good easy in quotes 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:44.440
 so that you use the sewing machine what 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.720
 bad is that if you keep 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:49.720
 sewing machine there is a product in the 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:51.970
 market that is this is the spray is a 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:54.730
 glue spray that serves both for 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:57.280
 leather for glass for fabrics os 

00:05:54.730 --> 00:06:00.520
 it serves instead of things then 2006 the spray 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:03.730
 and ccoo 6 put the pieces on the cloth 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:05.080
 no need to sew so you do not have 

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:07.240
 it's hard that you can do it with a 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:10.790
 spray of these and nothing that has 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:14.870
 liked the video you can give them a thumb 

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:16.370
 up a very fat kiss very fat and 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:18.910
 nothing that I hope for you in the next video 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:18.910
 goodbye
