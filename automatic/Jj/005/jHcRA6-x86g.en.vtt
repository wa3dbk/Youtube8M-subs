00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:04.830
 this week in which the mec released the results of schools with better 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.740
 performance in secondary education, which allied and took place in relation to 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:14.270
 private schools and public schools still need to improve a lot and 

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:17.919
 some philanthropic institutions can serve as examples 

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:22.389
 they have similar pedagogical proposals there are traditional and 

00:00:22.389 --> 00:00:25.179
 presented part of the results 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:29.550
 structured laboratories multiprofessional team of service to the 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.380
 students 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.460
 the structure that the petitioner is convinced by the state 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.530
 but the Catarina school and 34 30 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.580
 attendance being fundamental 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.090
 eight hundred poor students from the neighborhood memorare north of the capital 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.890
 the biggest difference is in the pedagogical proposal 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.390
 with a focus on reading and understanding 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.550
 in the second year 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.550
 everyone pleads less the book per week 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.560
 in this way to preserve impunity 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.820
 was what we did in the Bordeaux treatments 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.200
 the classes are demure with ludic activities like lusa 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.280
 in the same year in May of the process 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.710
 these students are trained readers 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.259
 teams a lot of difference from the entrance exam 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:19.070
 they will get 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.660
 a greater condition of understanding than of interpreting 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.640
 already those who have the experience of reading on September 27 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.520
 between them they could not 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.770
 the quality that is necessary because expropriation 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.510
 the results achieved over 54 years reflects 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.540
 in 2009 the school had 500 registrations for 50 vacancies 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.430
 the interest happens through a judicious process 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.890
 the children go through a selective test and up they want it is necessary commitment 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.420
 who disapproves gives place to who is on the waiting list 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.990
 and we always try to work with the family so that the 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.859
 child has a good going home student too 

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:03.900
 when this is not possible 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.390
 but the family does not interest us 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.720
 and the child 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.220
 gets in trouble with the school can not 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.800
 - we have to ask for the child's withdrawal upon completion of 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.300
 fundamental for 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.670
 suzana won an integral scholarship to attend high school in one of the most 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.669

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.959

 students from other schools 

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:37.709

 was the eighth place in piauÃ­ the last enem 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:45.559
 the story began in 1992 with reinforcement classes 

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:50.299
 the structures were placed where a smoke-hole worked in the neighborhood 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:51.490
 satellite 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.630
 can only change the lives of families through education and education 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.630
 basic education releases this maximum 

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:02.979
 elementary school students still have a morning reinforcement in the afternoon 

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:07.189
 in high school it is seven and a half hours in the classroom per day 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:09.359
