I'm sorry the PlayStation TV you get a

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.999 
I'm sorry the PlayStation TV you get a
PlayStation<00:01:21.900> 3<00:01:22.080> controller<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.799> it<00:01:22.890> does

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
PlayStation 3 controller and it does

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.890 
PlayStation 3 controller and it does
work<00:01:23.159> with<00:01:23.250> ps3<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:23.850> ps4<00:01:24.030> so<00:01:24.509> if<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:24.630> have<00:01:24.720> any

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
work with ps3 and ps4 so if you have any

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.630 
work with ps3 and ps4 so if you have any
of<00:01:25.020> those<00:01:25.080> controllers<00:01:25.470> that'll<00:01:26.250> work<00:01:26.430> I

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
of those controllers that'll work I

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.830 
of those controllers that'll work I
actually<00:01:26.970> I<00:01:27.000> think<00:01:27.119> it'll<00:01:27.240> be<00:01:27.360> better<00:01:27.479> on<00:01:27.630> ps4

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
actually I think it'll be better on ps4

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.090 
actually I think it'll be better on ps4
since<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.259> actually<00:01:28.500> can<00:01:28.619> use<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:29.070> the

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
since you actually can use the the

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.980 
since you actually can use the the
touchpad<00:01:29.490> just<00:01:30.329> like<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.570> would<00:01:30.689> be<00:01:30.840> able<00:01:30.900> to

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
touchpad just like you would be able to

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.780 
touchpad just like you would be able to
use<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.229> touchscreen<00:01:31.530> on<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.860> Vita<00:01:32.040> one

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
use the touchscreen on the Vita one

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.880 
use the touchscreen on the Vita one
thing<00:01:33.030> though<00:01:33.240> no<00:01:33.540> internal<00:01:34.229> storage<00:01:34.619> a

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
thing though no internal storage a

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.310 
thing though no internal storage a
little<00:01:35.460> not<00:01:36.119> that<00:01:36.360> much<00:01:36.570> though<00:01:36.750> I<00:01:36.960> think<00:01:37.020> it's

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
little not that much though I think it's

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.530 
little not that much though I think it's
the<00:01:37.590> Vita<00:01:38.189> mm<00:01:38.670> has<00:01:38.759> like<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:39.060> gig<00:01:39.360> of<00:01:39.509> storage

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
the Vita mm has like a gig of storage

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.480 
the Vita mm has like a gig of storage
that<00:01:39.900> you<00:01:40.049> can't<00:01:40.290> really<00:01:40.560> use<00:01:40.680> like<00:01:41.250> for

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
that you can't really use like for

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.010 
that you can't really use like for
anything<00:01:41.640> more<00:01:41.820> than<00:01:41.880> save<00:01:42.150> games<00:01:42.420> so<00:01:42.899> your

those PS Vita memory cards which are
kind<00:01:46.110> of<00:01:46.200> expensive<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:46.799> they're<00:01:46.890> kind<00:01:47.040> of

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
kind of expensive and they're kind of

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.660 
kind of expensive and they're kind of
lame<00:01:47.280> I<00:01:47.549> did<00:01:48.090> see<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.299> USB<00:01:48.750> port<00:01:49.020> on<00:01:49.140> the

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
lame I did see a USB port on the

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.609 
lame I did see a USB port on the
PlayStation<00:01:50.670> TV<00:01:50.790> though<00:01:51.090> so<00:01:51.450> maybe<00:01:52.170> they<00:01:52.439> let

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
PlayStation TV though so maybe they let

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:53.630 
PlayStation TV though so maybe they let
you<00:01:52.740> hook<00:01:52.799> up<00:01:52.920> an<00:01:53.070> external<00:01:53.310> hard<00:01:53.579> drive

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
you hook up an external hard drive

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.950 
you hook up an external hard drive
you're<00:01:54.149> probably<00:01:54.329> right<00:01:54.540> though<00:01:54.689> they'll

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
you're probably right though they'll

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.120 
you're probably right though they'll
just<00:01:55.320> be<00:01:55.439> for<00:01:55.560> like<00:01:55.649> charging<00:01:56.040> the

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
just be for like charging the

just be for like charging the
controllers<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:56.729> stuff<00:01:57.030> but<00:01:57.659> I<00:01:57.689> mean<00:01:58.020> for

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
controllers and stuff but I mean for

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.780 
controllers and stuff but I mean for
hundred<00:01:58.649> dollars<00:01:58.950> this<00:01:59.369> is<00:01:59.430> something<00:01:59.759> that

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
hundred dollars this is something that

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.580 
hundred dollars this is something that
especially<00:02:00.210> if<00:02:00.479> they<00:02:00.570> get<00:02:00.750> all<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.170> media

pretty pumped yeah I completely agree I

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.050 
pretty pumped yeah I completely agree I

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
think that the living room space for

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.210 
think that the living room space for
sort<00:02:30.480> of<00:02:30.540> casual<00:02:31.080> gamers<00:02:31.500> that's<00:02:31.799> something

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
sort of casual gamers that's something

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.030 
sort of casual gamers that's something
that's<00:02:32.430> we<00:02:33.269> all<00:02:33.420> think<00:02:34.170> is<00:02:34.319> going<00:02:34.500> to<00:02:34.590> expand

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
that's we all think is going to expand

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.930 
that's we all think is going to expand
in<00:02:35.190> a<00:02:35.280> big<00:02:35.430> way

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
in a big way

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.630 
in a big way

space because right now Apple TV is a

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:50.660 
space because right now Apple TV is a
pretty<00:02:47.660> straightforward<00:02:48.660> device<00:02:49.349> right<00:02:49.890> yeah

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
pretty straightforward device right yeah

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.309 
pretty straightforward device right yeah
I<00:02:50.700> mean<00:02:50.849> the<00:02:51.150> software<00:02:51.360> etcetera<00:02:52.049> me<00:02:52.170> only

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
I mean the software etcetera me only

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.130 
I mean the software etcetera me only
does<00:02:52.620> a<00:02:52.650> few<00:02:52.950> things<00:02:53.280> and<00:02:53.840> it<00:02:54.840> could<00:02:54.989> probably

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
does a few things and it could probably

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.110 
does a few things and it could probably
do<00:02:55.530> a<00:02:55.560> lot<00:02:55.739> more<00:02:55.799> with<00:02:56.099> an<00:02:56.250> app<00:02:56.400> store<00:02:56.579> etcetera

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
do a lot more with an app store etcetera

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.580
