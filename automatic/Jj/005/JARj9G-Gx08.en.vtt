a little trip tip I picked up off Jeff
that<00:01:42.160> way<00:01:42.280> if<00:01:42.430> any<00:01:42.610> crap<00:01:42.940> gets<00:01:43.180> in<00:01:43.330> there<00:01:43.540> when

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
that way if any crap gets in there when

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.999 
that way if any crap gets in there when
you're<00:01:44.080> actually<00:01:44.320> making<00:01:45.210> components<00:01:47.009> it

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
you're actually making components it

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:51.090 
you're actually making components it
doesn't<00:01:48.369> hold<00:01:48.460> the<00:01:48.640> mold<00:01:48.820> apart<00:01:49.000> so<00:01:50.040> there<00:01:51.040> you

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
doesn't hold the mold apart so there you

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.940 
doesn't hold the mold apart so there you
go<00:01:51.280> she's<00:01:51.850> all<00:01:52.030> Bakst<00:01:52.780> just<00:01:53.229> ready<00:01:53.440> for<00:01:53.530> PVA

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
go she's all Bakst just ready for PVA

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.680 
go she's all Bakst just ready for PVA
and<00:01:54.340> then<00:01:54.640> we<00:01:54.759> can<00:01:54.940> pour<00:01:55.180> the<00:01:55.330> second<00:01:55.660> side

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
and then we can pour the second side

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.800 
and then we can pour the second side
okay<00:01:58.860> so<00:01:59.860> Martha's<00:02:00.430> jaw<00:02:00.610> coded<00:02:01.060> ready<00:02:01.479> to<00:02:01.660> go

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
okay so Martha's jaw coded ready to go

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.719 
okay so Martha's jaw coded ready to go
again<00:02:02.200> just<00:02:03.360> on<00:02:04.360> a<00:02:04.539> show<00:02:04.890> this<00:02:05.890> is<00:02:05.950> the<00:02:06.160> din

8<00:02:10.239> 2<00:02:10.739> very<00:02:11.739> very<00:02:12.070> fine<00:02:12.310> powder<00:02:13.320> Jeff<00:02:14.320> and<00:02:14.470> I've

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
8 2 very very fine powder Jeff and I've

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.140 
8 2 very very fine powder Jeff and I've
just<00:02:14.770> been<00:02:14.920> discussing<00:02:15.250> it's<00:02:15.610> very<00:02:15.910> very

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
just been discussing it's very very

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.300 
just been discussing it's very very
similar<00:02:16.390> to<00:02:16.690> the<00:02:16.870> EPI<00:02:17.290> self<00:02:18.510> reflection<00:02:19.510> layer

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
similar to the EPI self reflection layer

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.039 
similar to the EPI self reflection layer
and<00:02:21.310> this<00:02:21.459> is<00:02:21.519> the<00:02:21.790> volume<00:02:22.150> of<00:02:22.390> resin<00:02:22.900> this

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:23.049 
and this is the volume of resin this

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:25.590 
and this is the volume of resin this
time<00:02:23.290> around<00:02:23.530> so<00:02:23.890> it's<00:02:24.250> about<00:02:24.430> a<00:02:24.700> leader<00:02:25.150> then

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
time around so it's about a leader then

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.170 
time around so it's about a leader then
I<00:02:25.750> suppose<00:02:26.430> I'm<00:02:27.430> just<00:02:27.489> going<00:02:27.790> to<00:02:27.850> give<00:02:28.000> that<00:02:28.030> a

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
I suppose I'm just going to give that a

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.620 
I suppose I'm just going to give that a
bit<00:02:28.390> of<00:02:28.480> a<00:02:28.540> mix<00:02:29.190> we<00:02:30.190> get<00:02:30.340> mixed<00:02:30.549> up<00:02:30.760> what

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
bit of a mix we get mixed up what

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.180 
bit of a mix we get mixed up what
appears<00:02:31.959> to<00:02:32.080> be<00:02:32.200> almost<00:02:32.380> 2<00:02:32.799> liters<00:02:33.160> of

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
appears to be almost 2 liters of

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.550 
appears to be almost 2 liters of
material<00:02:34.320> ready<00:02:35.320> to<00:02:35.500> pour<00:02:36.900> now<00:02:37.900> I'm<00:02:38.320> going<00:02:38.470> to

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
material ready to pour now I'm going to

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.840 
material ready to pour now I'm going to
try<00:02:38.830> to<00:02:38.860> use<00:02:39.280> the<00:02:39.730> advice<00:02:40.060> from<00:02:40.450> RC<00:02:41.230> groups<00:02:41.530> and

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
try to use the advice from RC groups and

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.449 
try to use the advice from RC groups and
pour<00:02:42.850> this<00:02:43.030> from<00:02:43.269> a<00:02:43.299> little<00:02:43.600> bit<00:02:43.690> of<00:02:43.780> a<00:02:43.870> height

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
pour this from a little bit of a height

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:52.860 
pour this from a little bit of a height
so<00:02:45.459> that<00:02:45.730> it<00:02:50.340> so<00:02:51.340> that<00:02:51.579> in<00:02:51.730> time<00:02:51.970> stretches<00:02:52.720> the

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
so that it so that in time stretches the

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.840 
so that it so that in time stretches the
mix<00:02:53.079> a<00:02:53.230> little<00:02:53.350> bit<00:02:53.610> it's<00:02:54.610> going<00:02:54.730> to<00:02:54.790> be

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
mix a little bit it's going to be

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.100 
mix a little bit it's going to be
careful<00:02:55.150> I<00:02:55.209> don't<00:02:55.239> pour<00:02:55.570> it<00:02:55.600> all<00:02:55.780> over<00:02:55.810> the

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
as long as it's continuous again this

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.360 
as long as it's continuous again this
feels<00:03:23.290> like<00:03:23.440> there's<00:03:23.770> going<00:03:23.920> to<00:03:23.980> be<00:03:24.040> way<00:03:24.340> too

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
job coat I used my new butane torch and

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.370 
job coat I used my new butane torch and
when<00:04:07.090> I<00:04:07.120> got<00:04:07.360> it<00:04:07.480> into<00:04:07.630> one<00:04:07.840> of<00:04:07.960> the<00:04:08.020> corners

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
when I got it into one of the corners

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.710 
when I got it into one of the corners
here<00:04:08.650> the<00:04:09.250> tape<00:04:09.520> that<00:04:09.790> I<00:04:09.820> had<00:04:10.060> behind<00:04:10.390> the<00:04:10.540> job

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
here the tape that I had behind the job

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.710 
here the tape that I had behind the job
coat<00:04:10.930> lid<00:04:11.590> on<00:04:11.710> fire<00:04:11.980> so<00:04:12.910> one<00:04:13.240> corner<00:04:13.570> of<00:04:13.630> the

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
coat lid on fire so one corner of the

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.120 
coat lid on fire so one corner of the
mole<00:04:13.870> is<00:04:14.110> going<00:04:14.290> to<00:04:14.350> have<00:04:14.440> a<00:04:14.470> bit<00:04:14.680> that<00:04:14.860> maybe

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
mole is going to have a bit that maybe

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.699 
mole is going to have a bit that maybe
even<00:04:15.490> sticks<00:04:15.880> or<00:04:16.120> something<00:04:16.620> but<00:04:17.620> I've
