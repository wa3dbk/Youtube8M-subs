g'day<00:00:01.199> folks<00:00:01.669> well<00:00:02.669> I<00:00:02.760> just<00:00:02.790> thought<00:00:03.030> I'd<00:00:03.179> make

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
g'day folks well I just thought I'd make

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.039 
g'day folks well I just thought I'd make
a<00:00:04.160> attempt<00:00:05.160> to<00:00:05.250> turn<00:00:05.549> this<00:00:05.730> old<00:00:05.940> LCD<00:00:06.569> backlight

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
a attempt to turn this old LCD backlight

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.770 
a attempt to turn this old LCD backlight
assembly<00:00:07.770> into<00:00:08.069> a<00:00:08.099> decent<00:00:08.790> decent<00:00:09.090> panel<00:00:09.540> lamp

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
assembly into a decent decent panel lamp

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.280 
assembly into a decent decent panel lamp
for<00:00:09.960> above<00:00:10.170> this<00:00:10.320> workbench<00:00:10.800> and<00:00:12.259> yeah<00:00:13.259> I

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
for above this workbench and yeah I

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.660 
for above this workbench and yeah I
think<00:00:13.410> it<00:00:13.530> do<00:00:13.650> not<00:00:13.679> be<00:00:13.920> good<00:00:14.130> night<00:00:14.370> because

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
think it do not be good night because

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:15.950 
think it do not be good night because
it's<00:00:14.790> not<00:00:14.910> much<00:00:15.059> else<00:00:15.240> to<00:00:15.360> do<00:00:15.570> apart<00:00:15.870> from

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
it's not much else to do apart from

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.990 
it's not much else to do apart from
assemble<00:00:16.470> drawers<00:00:16.770> and<00:00:17.279> I've<00:00:17.910> already

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
assemble drawers and I've already

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.970 
assemble drawers and I've already
knocked<00:00:18.300> at<00:00:18.449> once<00:00:18.630> before<00:00:18.840> and<00:00:19.109> broken<00:00:19.529> one

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
knocked at once before and broken one

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.189 
knocked at once before and broken one
CFL<00:00:20.970> tube<00:00:21.240> and<00:00:21.420> then<00:00:21.510> I<00:00:21.600> knocked<00:00:21.779> it<00:00:21.869> before

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
CFL tube and then I knocked it before

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.560 
CFL tube and then I knocked it before
and<00:00:22.350> broke<00:00:22.500> another<00:00:22.740> one<00:00:22.830> so<00:00:23.310> it's<00:00:24.210> do<00:00:24.420> or<00:00:24.449> die

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
and broke another one so it's do or die

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.359 
and broke another one so it's do or die
time<00:00:24.930> for<00:00:25.289> it<00:00:25.350> before<00:00:25.619> I<00:00:25.710> end<00:00:25.859> up<00:00:25.949> breaking<00:00:26.130> the

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
time for it before I end up breaking the

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.310 
time for it before I end up breaking the
rest<00:00:26.550> of<00:00:26.670> them<00:00:26.789> thankfully<00:00:27.689> they<00:00:27.750> just<00:00:27.930> unplug

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
rest of them thankfully they just unplug

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.140 
rest of them thankfully they just unplug
it<00:00:28.439> at<00:00:28.529> one<00:00:28.650> end<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:29.460> other<00:00:29.580> ends<00:00:29.820> are<00:00:29.910> snapped

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
it at one end the other ends are snapped

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.680 
it at one end the other ends are snapped
off<00:00:30.390> but<00:00:30.890> they're<00:00:32.090> easy<00:00:33.090> enough<00:00:33.210> to<00:00:33.360> remove

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
off but they're easy enough to remove

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.389 
off but they're easy enough to remove
and<00:00:33.899> hopefully<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.500> inverter<00:00:34.800> doesn't<00:00:35.190> mind

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
and hopefully the inverter doesn't mind

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.080 
and hopefully the inverter doesn't mind
their<00:00:35.670> absence<00:00:36.649> so<00:00:37.649> I<00:00:38.070> just<00:00:38.610> want<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:38.820> try<00:00:38.969> and

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
their absence so I just want to try and

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.049 
their absence so I just want to try and
fire<00:00:39.270> this<00:00:39.450> power<00:00:39.690> supply<00:00:40.050> up<00:00:40.230> at<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.440> moment

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
fire this power supply up at the moment

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:43.610 
fire this power supply up at the moment
luckily<00:00:42.059> all<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.570> pin<00:00:42.750> outs<00:00:42.960> are<00:00:43.260> marked<00:00:43.530> on

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
luckily all the pin outs are marked on

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.700 
luckily all the pin outs are marked on
the<00:00:43.739> board<00:00:43.920> there<00:00:44.600> including<00:00:45.600> this<00:00:46.320> cable

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
the board there including this cable

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.720 
the board there including this cable
here<00:00:46.739> which<00:00:47.070> is<00:00:47.190> inverter<00:00:47.520> on/off<00:00:47.969> dim<00:00:48.750> or

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
here which is inverter on/off dim or

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.060 
here which is inverter on/off dim or
detect<00:00:50.730> five<00:00:51.000> volts<00:00:51.420> or<00:00:51.600> dat<00:00:51.989> fire<00:00:52.530> bolt<00:00:52.860> which

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
detect five volts or dat fire bolt which

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.029 
detect five volts or dat fire bolt which
I'm<00:00:53.219> guessing<00:00:53.370> is<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.989> detection<00:00:54.989> for<00:00:55.440> startup

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
I'm guessing is a detection for startup

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.889 
I'm guessing is a detection for startup
or<00:00:56.250> something<00:00:56.579> maybe<00:00:56.940> your<00:00:57.090> safety<00:00:57.510> shutdown

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
or something maybe your safety shutdown

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.020 
or something maybe your safety shutdown
thing<00:00:58.309> don't<00:00:59.309> know<00:00:59.399> that's<00:00:59.879> what<00:01:00.000> a

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
thing don't know that's what a

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.110 
thing don't know that's what a
multimeter<00:01:00.449> is<00:01:00.570> for<00:01:00.750> to<00:01:00.870> find<00:01:01.079> out<00:01:01.699> if<00:01:02.699> it<00:01:02.820> is<00:01:02.879> 5

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
multimeter is for to find out if it is 5

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.090 
multimeter is for to find out if it is 5
volts<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:03.660> put<00:01:03.809> it<00:01:03.899> across<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.439> inverter<00:01:04.949> on

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
volts and I put it across to inverter on

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.640 
volts and I put it across to inverter on
off<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.400> should<00:01:05.430> turn<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.210> on

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
off it should turn it on

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.679 
off it should turn it on
if<00:01:07.650> not<00:01:07.979> then<00:01:08.220> well<00:01:08.580> might<00:01:09.060> pop<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:09.450> but<00:01:09.659> I

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
if not then well might pop it but I

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.780 
if not then well might pop it but I
doubt<00:01:09.990> it<00:01:10.229> usually<00:01:10.590> these<00:01:10.740> have<00:01:10.890> used<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.310> 5

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
doubt it usually these have used a 5

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.750 
doubt it usually these have used a 5

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
done a little bit of probing around and

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:00.859 
done a little bit of probing around and
research<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:58.770> yes<00:01:59.610> it<00:01:59.759> does<00:01:59.790> have<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.090> detect<00:02:00.570> 5

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869

so<00:02:42.630> be<00:02:43.110> very<00:02:43.470> careful<00:02:43.740> if<00:02:43.980> you<00:02:44.100> mess<00:02:44.250> around

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
so be very careful if you mess around

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.030 
so be very careful if you mess around
something<00:02:44.880> like<00:02:45.030> this<00:02:45.240> a<00:02:45.510> lot<00:02:46.140> of<00:02:46.230> LCDs<00:02:46.770> have<00:02:46.800> a

off<00:02:56.100> mains<00:02:56.970> potential<00:02:57.710> so<00:02:58.710> you<00:02:58.770> want<00:02:59.250> to<00:02:59.310> be

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
off mains potential so you want to be

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.360

and<00:03:19.020> 5<00:03:19.260> volts<00:03:19.680> so<00:03:20.670> let's<00:03:21.180> reintroduce<00:03:21.540> 5<00:03:22.140> volts

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
and 5 volts so let's reintroduce 5 volts

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.670 
and 5 volts so let's reintroduce 5 volts
to<00:03:22.530> the<00:03:22.620> detect<00:03:23.070> 5<00:03:23.280> volts<00:03:23.700> and<00:03:24.500> there<00:03:25.500> we<00:03:25.560> go

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
to the detect 5 volts and there we go

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.000 
to the detect 5 volts and there we go
mains<00:03:26.040> real<00:03:26.250> it<00:03:26.400> comes<00:03:26.610> on<00:03:27.560> so<00:03:28.560> the<00:03:28.709> inverter

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
mains real it comes on so the inverter

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.470 
mains real it comes on so the inverter
will<00:03:29.190> be<00:03:29.280> getting<00:03:29.430> some<00:03:29.730> power<00:03:30.030> probably<00:03:30.270> not

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
will be getting some power probably not

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.390 
will be getting some power probably not
all<00:03:30.660> of<00:03:30.810> it<00:03:30.900> it's<00:03:31.650> definitely<00:03:31.770> not<00:03:32.010> lighting

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
all of it it's definitely not lighting

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.870 
all of it it's definitely not lighting
up<00:03:32.520> but<00:03:33.510> if<00:03:34.020> I<00:03:34.290> were<00:03:34.680> to<00:03:34.740> supply<00:03:35.100> 5<00:03:35.490> volts<00:03:35.820> to

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
up but if I were to supply 5 volts to

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:42.170 
up but if I were to supply 5 volts to
inverter<00:03:36.270> on<00:03:36.480> off<00:03:36.660> it<00:03:36.840> should<00:03:36.870> work<00:03:37.230> so<00:03:41.180> that's

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
inverter on off it should work so that's

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.150 
inverter on off it should work so that's
good<00:03:42.420> and<00:03:43.110> I<00:03:43.170> can<00:03:43.290> leave<00:03:43.440> that<00:03:43.470> bridged<00:03:43.890> out<00:03:44.130> I

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
good and I can leave that bridged out I

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.110 
good and I can leave that bridged out I
should<00:03:44.400> just<00:03:44.520> be<00:03:44.610> able<00:03:44.640> to<00:03:44.760> turn<00:03:44.910> this<00:03:45.060> thing

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120

done<00:03:47.720> but<00:03:48.720> yeah<00:03:48.959> that's<00:03:49.110> getting<00:03:49.440> 5<00:03:49.650> volts

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
done but yeah that's getting 5 volts

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.840

with<00:03:50.130> respect<00:03:50.160> to<00:03:50.640> ground<00:03:52.580> okay<00:03:53.580> I'm<00:03:53.700> getting

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
with respect to ground okay I'm getting

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.580 
with respect to ground okay I'm getting
somewhere<00:03:54.240> but<00:03:54.690> now<00:03:54.870> I'm<00:03:54.990> stuck<00:03:55.230> with<00:03:55.290> it's

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
somewhere but now I'm stuck with it's

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.190 
somewhere but now I'm stuck with it's
strobing<00:03:56.220> it<00:03:56.910> might<00:03:57.270> be<00:03:57.450> because<00:03:57.600> I<00:03:57.810> broke<00:03:58.170> a

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
strobing it might be because I broke a

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.440 
strobing it might be because I broke a
couple<00:03:58.500> of<00:03:58.650> the<00:03:58.740> tubes<00:03:59.160> which<00:04:00.000> is<00:04:00.120> a<00:04:00.150> bit<00:04:00.330> of<00:04:00.390> a

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
couple of the tubes which is a bit of a

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.580 
couple of the tubes which is a bit of a
shame<00:04:00.690> if<00:04:00.840> it<00:04:00.959> is<00:04:02.300> it<00:04:03.300> comes<00:04:03.480> on<00:04:03.720> and<00:04:04.440> then<00:04:04.530> just

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
shame if it is it comes on and then just

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.819 
shame if it is it comes on and then just
starts<00:04:05.070> flashing
