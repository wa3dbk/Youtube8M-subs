 however, we have what we call the complementary scholarship 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.230
 complementary scholarships because percent we have food grants we have 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:17.870

 There is a full scholarship that includes boarding and feeding 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:31.890

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.470
 where students can be drawn to these different types of branch 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.450

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.130
 for new ones to cover their expenses as if as a student claim we have another 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.670
 so much 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.130
