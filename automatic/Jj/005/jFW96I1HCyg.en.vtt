00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879 
crossmembers fit the vehicle the way it

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:16.819 
crossmembers fit the vehicle the way it

I<00:04:49.930> first<00:04:50.170> started<00:04:50.470> working<00:04:50.740> here<00:04:50.890> I<00:04:50.920> started

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
I first started working here I started

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.850 
I first started working here I started
as<00:04:51.580> pretty<00:04:52.090> much<00:04:52.180> a<00:04:52.360> TIG<00:04:53.020> welder<00:04:53.110> as<00:04:53.560> I

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
as pretty much a TIG welder as I

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.890 
as pretty much a TIG welder as I
progressed<00:04:54.490> I<00:04:54.700> moved<00:04:54.940> up<00:04:55.120> the<00:04:55.270> mig<00:04:55.480> welding

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
progressed I moved up the mig welding

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.870 
progressed I moved up the mig welding
mig<00:04:56.500> welders<00:04:56.890> to<00:04:56.980> different<00:04:57.400> department<00:04:57.850> I

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
mig welders to different department I

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.670 
mig welders to different department I
pretty<00:04:58.150> much<00:04:58.240> trained<00:04:58.660> guys<00:04:58.900> they<00:04:59.200> the<00:04:59.530> new

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
pretty much trained guys they the new

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.040 
pretty much trained guys they the new
guys<00:04:59.860> that<00:04:59.890> come<00:05:00.220> here<00:05:00.250> now<00:05:00.550> and<00:05:01.420> I<00:05:01.510> teach<00:05:01.840> them

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
guys that come here now and I teach them

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.470 
guys that come here now and I teach them
the<00:05:02.200> quality<00:05:02.530> work<00:05:03.040> that<00:05:03.070> we<00:05:03.340> need<00:05:03.550> and<00:05:03.790> then

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:04.480 
the quality work that we need and then

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.390 
the quality work that we need and then
order<00:05:04.870> for<00:05:05.050> them<00:05:05.200> to<00:05:05.230> continue<00:05:05.620> to<00:05:05.980> work<00:05:06.160> here

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 
order for them to continue to work here

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.520 
order for them to continue to work here
they<00:05:06.580> have<00:05:06.670> to<00:05:06.700> have<00:05:07.180> a<00:05:07.210> idea<00:05:08.140> of<00:05:08.290> what<00:05:08.410> we're

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
they have to have a idea of what we're

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:08.970 
they have to have a idea of what we're
looking<00:05:08.740> for

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:08.980 
looking for

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.940 
looking for
I<00:05:09.220> like<00:05:09.940> we're<00:05:10.090> gonna<00:05:10.180> heights<00:05:10.480> because<00:05:10.960> we're

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:11.950 
I like we're gonna heights because we're

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:13.290 
I like we're gonna heights because we're
the<00:05:12.010> best<00:05:12.190> in<00:05:12.340> the<00:05:12.400> industry<00:05:12.520> as<00:05:13.060> far<00:05:13.120> as

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
the best in the industry as far as

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.120 
the best in the industry as far as
welding<00:05:13.660> if<00:05:14.110> we're<00:05:14.350> not<00:05:14.470> we'll<00:05:14.710> make<00:05:14.890> it<00:05:15.040> the

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130 
welding if we're not we'll make it the

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.490 
welding if we're not we'll make it the
best<00:05:15.330> everything<00:05:16.330> we<00:05:16.450> do<00:05:16.600> here<00:05:16.810> is<00:05:16.960> all<00:05:17.110> hand

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500 
best everything we do here is all hand

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.740 
best everything we do here is all hand
welding<00:05:17.920> no<00:05:18.460> machines<00:05:18.850> I<00:05:19.180> believe<00:05:19.600> it's

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
welding no machines I believe it's

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.810 
welding no machines I believe it's
better<00:05:19.900> that<00:05:19.990> way<00:05:20.290> quality<00:05:21.250> means<00:05:21.340> everything

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:21.820 
better that way quality means everything

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:25.860 
better that way quality means everything
to<00:05:22.150> us<00:05:22.800> we<00:05:23.940> have<00:05:24.940> our<00:05:25.090> own<00:05:25.240> standards

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
to us we have our own standards

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.990 
to us we have our own standards
we<00:05:26.080> think<00:05:26.290> the<00:05:26.500> MIG<00:05:26.950> welding<00:05:27.280> is<00:05:27.370> a<00:05:27.400> lost<00:05:27.670> art

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
we think the MIG welding is a lost art

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.630 
we think the MIG welding is a lost art
we<00:05:28.450> put<00:05:28.960> that<00:05:29.260> back<00:05:29.470> into<00:05:29.680> it<00:05:29.950> I<00:05:30.130> think<00:05:30.340> at

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:30.640 
we put that back into it I think at

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.610 
we put that back into it I think at
Heights<00:05:30.880> they<00:05:31.270> allow<00:05:31.480> us<00:05:31.630> to<00:05:31.750> do<00:05:31.870> that<00:05:32.080> so<00:05:32.410> our

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.620 
Heights they allow us to do that so our

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.280 
Heights they allow us to do that so our
MIG<00:05:33.310> welding<00:05:33.670> is<00:05:33.820> second<00:05:34.300> to<00:05:34.390> none<00:05:34.510> in<00:05:35.110> a

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:35.290 
MIG welding is second to none in a

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:37.620 
MIG welding is second to none in a
week's<00:05:35.500> time<00:05:35.710> here<00:05:36.280> I<00:05:36.460> learned<00:05:36.820> more<00:05:37.090> than<00:05:37.600> I

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:37.630 
week's time here I learned more than I

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.930 
week's time here I learned more than I
did<00:05:37.780> at<00:05:38.020> school<00:05:38.230> over<00:05:38.860> the<00:05:38.980> course<00:05:39.220> of<00:05:39.430> the<00:05:39.580> few

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940 
did at school over the course of the few

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.240 
did at school over the course of the few
months<00:05:40.060> that<00:05:40.210> I<00:05:40.330> was<00:05:40.390> there<00:05:40.750> it's<00:05:41.170> just<00:05:41.530> it

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.250 
months that I was there it's just it

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:52.490 
months that I was there it's just it
just<00:05:42.430> the<00:05:42.520> quality<00:05:42.940> beyond<00:05:43.300> your<00:05:43.660> norm

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.909
