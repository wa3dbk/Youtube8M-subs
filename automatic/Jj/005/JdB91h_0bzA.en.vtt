yeah<00:01:43.610> super<00:01:44.060> safe<00:01:44.270> I<00:01:44.420> think<00:01:44.450> it<00:01:44.689> actually<00:01:44.960> got

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
yeah super safe I think it actually got

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.380 
yeah super safe I think it actually got
a<00:01:45.110> very<00:01:45.650> very<00:01:45.890> high<00:01:46.040> safety<00:01:46.460> rating<00:01:46.729> not<00:01:47.210> that

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
a very very high safety rating not that

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.030 
a very very high safety rating not that
that<00:01:47.509> was<00:01:47.630> even<00:01:47.720> a<00:01:47.960> consideration<00:01:48.259> I<00:01:48.770> found

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
that was even a consideration I found

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.310 
that was even a consideration I found
that<00:01:49.159> out<00:01:49.310> afterwards

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
that except for the fact that sometimes

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:12.910 
that except for the fact that sometimes
it<00:02:11.660> gets<00:02:11.780> a<00:02:11.840> wee<00:02:11.960> bit<00:02:12.110> hot<00:02:12.290> and<00:02:12.320> just<00:02:12.500> nobody

I<00:02:16.340> think<00:02:16.430> with<00:02:16.730> the<00:02:16.760> roof<00:02:17.090> down<00:02:17.360> like<00:02:17.600> this<00:02:17.810> is

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
I think with the roof down like this is

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.620 
I think with the roof down like this is
sort<00:02:18.320> of<00:02:18.380> there's<00:02:19.190> not<00:02:19.370> much<00:02:19.550> wind<00:02:20.120> comes<00:02:20.450> in

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
sort of there's not much wind comes in

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.350 
sort of there's not much wind comes in
with<00:02:20.810> the<00:02:20.930> rear<00:02:21.250> stopper<00:02:22.250> on<00:02:22.400> there<00:02:22.610> so<00:02:23.270> you

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
with the rear stopper on there so you

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.820 
with the rear stopper on there so you
don't<00:02:23.480> really<00:02:23.690> get<00:02:23.930> you<00:02:24.530> know<00:02:24.560> if<00:02:24.680> you've<00:02:24.800> got

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
don't really get you know if you've got

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.290 
don't really get you know if you've got
a<00:02:24.980> girlfriend<00:02:25.220> that's<00:02:25.520> fussy<00:02:25.910> about<00:02:26.090> their

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
opposed to this way you've got a bit of

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.770 
opposed to this way you've got a bit of
real<00:03:49.340> feedback<00:03:49.580> you<00:03:49.970> really<00:03:50.210> feel<00:03:50.420> the<00:03:50.600> road
