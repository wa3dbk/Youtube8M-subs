00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.639
 artificial grass in almelo 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.450
 at heracles what is feyenoord the 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.459
 pitfall 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.830
 what me what should not do here 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:15.719
 not to go wrong 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.250
 yes we should not just have such a wonderful lesson 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.619
 the treasures i think we like ours 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.640
 own power must output and as dick 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.949
 bruna 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.419
 yes anyway always difficult from you 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.919
 have to do with artificial grass all sleeves 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:27.599
 and all those things 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:29.909
 there I would think that all like our 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.470
 thing to do, and houses three points 

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:33.630
 the minimum is for you yet 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.840
 special terrain 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.780
 yes in my opinion instructor yes yes debut in 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.190
 the basis for map also called is it 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.230
 word my third time so I can stuff 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.190
 will also just vary piece one 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.990
 cassette 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.100
 that was a fox me make the evening 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.050
 I have been every afternoon 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.700
 not clear to mind mama is that 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.930
 something that you often think back to 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.460
 at that moment when your coach 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.590
 ronald koeman came to you and said 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.910
 you get to work 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.010
 yes of course who had that I forget 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.930
 was not my first game anyway 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.170
 for feyenoord in the base 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.479
 yes something you can forget was yes and if 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.359
 a bit of tension and then went thinking 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.130
 I naturally do well and in addition 

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:12.689
 in the following years terrible 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.789
 gone fast with you or now you are 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.819
 actually, it is impossible to imagine life without the 

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:19.560
 from that base of your beloved club 

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:22.280
 no yes hard work anyway and he only one 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.450
 son continued to believe in yourself and 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.420
 I still always had faith in myself 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.460
 large and had always increased and your I 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.159
 that this also believe in god that so 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.240
 well they will come what did hard already 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.039
 worked 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.240
 what did you learn from the latter 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:40.119
 years development and also 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.290
 the entire trend around martins indi en 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:42.670
 the free you 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.770
 pastors with your marriage of brook 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.420
 and you with what has come their way 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.130
 even to criticism and first of course 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.470
 a lot of praise it seems a bit 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.140
 be the same way 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.720
 yes right yes we have we contain a lot 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.850
 things from a yes and what Tuesday 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.830
 experience metro or criticism and they 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.630
 can also subscribe and try such 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.600
 prevent things 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.100
 So yes, keep it educational with the tunnel 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.720
 in this season and I am thinking of one 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.099
 contest with psv the law they update 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.509
 Heerenveen not too long ago 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:11.769
 though for for you but maybe 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.200
 and also competitions where you 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:15.459
 paid once money here for 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.840
 the future 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.700
 of course their are ps bad 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.790
 matches that in between you think 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.170
 must learn from it and not always 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.480
 looking back at it 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.709
 live goes on and he tried 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.470
 found it was better to do 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.720
 yes there are often small mistakes 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.250
 perhaps from inexperience 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.870
 how can you get that out of your game 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.670
 or is that indeed normal 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.470
 gain competitive rhythm and and the years 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.690
 let him do his job 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.329
 maybe a piece for a living 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.040
 concentration i think i think i found 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:46.359
 I am all not in that then will not 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.500
 the photo but maybe for example 

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:49.269
 come 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.579
 yes other pictures too that you go from again 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:53.620
 I think they don't set tokens and learn 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:55.660
 same photo back 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.579
 finally how big and how fine it is 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.989
 also that you with the hint of brook that beside 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:00.579
 you have someone you can do with 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:03.820
 can read and write you play already 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:06.220
 together for so long 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.930
 yes spending play half percent 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.750
 slower I think communication as 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.260
 our ever better hole like defending and 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.760
 to attack 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.250
 that also counts cooling by 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.670
 each other know what to do him one thing 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.410
 nor do I almost forget 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.849
 if you enter your name at various 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.250
 soccer sites kweenie friezes themselves too 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:24.590
 also reads the best stories about it 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.540
 about your possible future, what time do you have 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.459
 that already come to you 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.239
 yes in authority on the internet not in the 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.640
 holes 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:33.290
 I'm just fine the trying high 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.510
 end with a nice day is therefore in 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.130
 teeth that not that not so 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.450
 what you have sometimes in one 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.220
 interview with a colleague of mine with 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.350
 francs stout together with boÃ«tius on pig 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.700
 what did you say yes i want i want 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.830
 also going to extend how are we going 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:50.200
 conversation actually heard nothing 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.200
 without being bitter I do n't want anything
