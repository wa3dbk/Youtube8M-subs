00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.450
 When the water is boiling we are going to

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.240
 at the same time that he goes back to live we turn off the 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.670
 fire and after discovering the magical 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.810
 we put some olive oil in the 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.810
 pan to fry the sausages 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.790

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.170
 let's start the filling from scratch 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.940
 The lemon has also been split by the 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:37.090

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:55.329
 to get around the town the 

00:02:52.999 --> 00:02:55.329
