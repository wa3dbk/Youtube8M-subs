00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.779
 sideways 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:29.730
 first we passed the legs 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.350
 up to the knee 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.570
 then here we see that the openings 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.600
 laterals allow us to over 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:50.960
 waist the front of the pajamas and 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.730
 then with a little effort and using 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.070
 the usual techniques to turn a 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.430
 person in the bed we raised him totally 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.510
 the back 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.510
 of the trousers 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.229
 we show it one of the materials only 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:07.010
 buy level with her is more than 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:09.380
 enough 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:12.920
 and on the other side 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:15.700
 we do the same operation 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.700
 how are you going 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:22.700
 without any effort or on the part of the 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:25.580
 mediator nor on the part of the elder the 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.770
 trousers stay tax 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.230
 the pants in the pajama jacket 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:34.870
 that we see that ahead is totally 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.870
 normal we open it from behind 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.600
 in the adventure we have made for 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:46.369
 be able to facilitate your writing 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.369
 we passed an arm first 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.320
 and then do not cheat 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.330
 we always have to keep in mind that 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.490
 if the grandfather consists of some free already 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.600
 we always have to start with the arm 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:06.310
 that keeps motionless 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.310
 then we passed the head 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.540
 we adjust the shoulders 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.730
 and to be in bed it 's more than 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.410
 enough to have reflects more and if 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.630
 we would like to fasten it from behind 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:25.069
 we have to do the same operation of 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:26.980
 before turning a little bit to the channel 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:30.700
 Adjustable well to the back part 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.700
 half of the Texan 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.740
 and then the same operation to finish 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.630
 to bet the other half 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:42.530
 we adjust with the three points in the 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:46.500
 color that has the pajamas and we already have 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:50.760
 the person totally dressed 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:52.610
 and completely normal as if it were a 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.930
