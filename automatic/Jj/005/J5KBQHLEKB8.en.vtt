00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:11.880 
I like about the anime adaptation is
that<00:04:10.450> the<00:04:10.540> small<00:04:10.780> scenarios<00:04:11.290> in<00:04:11.410> the<00:04:11.500> manga

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
that the small scenarios in the manga

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.770 
that the small scenarios in the manga
were<00:04:12.220> expanded<00:04:12.819> for<00:04:13.030> the<00:04:13.090> running<00:04:13.360> time<00:04:13.540> and

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780

another<00:04:16.299> segue<00:04:16.600> this<00:04:17.200> show<00:04:17.380> could<00:04:17.590> get<00:04:17.739> really

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
another segue this show could get really

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:19.710 
another segue this show could get really
funny<00:04:18.459> if<00:04:18.609> you<00:04:18.729> let<00:04:18.910> it<00:04:19.030> run<00:04:19.150> on<00:04:19.209> all<00:04:19.479> cylinders

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
so that should already give you an idea

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.219

this one is probably the best one in my

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.250 
this one is probably the best one in my
opinion<00:05:00.910> but<00:05:01.180> it<00:05:01.300> needs<00:05:01.479> some<00:05:01.630> research

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:02.260 
opinion but it needs some research

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.320
