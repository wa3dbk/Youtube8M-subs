00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:23.689 
see better see the score lines on there
they're<00:00:21.539> pretty<00:00:21.750> deep<00:00:22.080> here<00:00:22.500> between<00:00:23.310> the

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
they're pretty deep here between the

they're pretty deep here between the
counterweights<00:00:25.340> unless<00:00:26.340> you<00:00:26.519> can<00:00:26.670> see<00:00:26.910> them

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
those two options and say there's

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.440 
those two options and say there's
something<00:00:46.920> interesting<00:00:47.039> about<00:00:47.430> these<00:00:47.820> blocks

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
something interesting about these blocks

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.209 
something interesting about these blocks
here<00:00:48.870> from<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.200> brazen<00:00:49.590> Stratton<00:00:51.980> they<00:00:52.980> have

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
here from the brazen Stratton they have

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.750 
here from the brazen Stratton they have
the<00:00:53.579> cast<00:00:54.559> parts<00:00:55.559> for<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:55.980> breaker<00:00:56.370> point

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
the cast parts for a breaker point

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.319 
the cast parts for a breaker point
system<00:00:57.500> but<00:00:58.500> for<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.399> plunger<00:01:00.090> for<00:01:00.120> the

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
system but for the plunger for the

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.330 
system but for the plunger for the
breaker<00:01:00.539> points<00:01:00.840> is<00:01:01.199> not<00:01:01.379> machined<00:01:01.859> it's<00:01:02.190> not

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
breaker points is not machined it's not

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.520 
breaker points is not machined it's not
drilled<00:01:02.699> out<00:01:03.320> so<00:01:04.339> this<00:01:05.339> engine<00:01:05.760> is<00:01:05.970> from<00:01:06.600> 1987

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
drilled out so this engine is from 1987

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:14.510 
drilled out so this engine is from 1987
according<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.189> shroud<00:01:10.369> 87<00:01:12.229> so<00:01:13.520> brazen

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
according to the shroud 87 so brazen

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.499 
according to the shroud 87 so brazen
Stratton<00:01:15.030> use<00:01:16.159> an<00:01:17.159> almost<00:01:17.850> identical<00:01:18.030> block

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
Stratton use an almost identical block

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:22.670 
Stratton use an almost identical block
shortly<00:01:21.509> after<00:01:21.810> they<00:01:21.960> switched<00:01:22.350> over<00:01:22.650> from

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
shortly after they switched over from

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.960 
shortly after they switched over from
breaker<00:01:23.070> points<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.909> solid-state<00:01:24.450> ignition

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
breaker points to solid-state ignition

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.950 
breaker points to solid-state ignition
the<00:01:26.970> only<00:01:27.119> thing<00:01:27.240> they<00:01:27.360> didn't<00:01:27.600> do<00:01:27.750> was

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
the only thing they didn't do was

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.840 
the only thing they didn't do was
machine<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.619> plunger<00:01:29.420> because<00:01:30.420> you<00:01:30.750> need<00:01:31.049> to

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
machine the plunger because you need to

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.569 
machine the plunger because you need to
that's<00:01:32.850> how<00:01:33.060> little<00:01:33.360> they<00:01:33.479> changed<00:01:33.900> over<00:01:34.140> time

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:34.579 
that's how little they changed over time

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:37.039 
that's how little they changed over time
that's<00:01:35.579> why<00:01:35.790> so<00:01:35.970> many<00:01:36.030> breaks<00:01:36.509> parts<00:01:36.930> are

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
that's why so many breaks parts are

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.039 
that's why so many breaks parts are
interchangeable<00:01:38.030> even<00:01:39.030> over<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.540> course<00:01:39.900> of

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
interchangeable even over the course of

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.139 
interchangeable even over the course of
a<00:01:40.140> couple<00:01:40.320> of<00:01:40.500> years<00:01:41.420> so<00:01:42.420> I<00:01:43.729> always<00:01:44.729> find<00:01:45.030> that

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
a couple of years so I always find that

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:51.070 
a couple of years so I always find that
interesting<00:01:46.549> and<00:01:47.549> helpful<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:49.729> you<00:01:50.729> know

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
interesting and helpful to you know

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.150 
interesting and helpful to you know
this<00:01:51.740> 54<00:01:52.280> from<00:01:52.520> 87<00:01:53.180> and<00:01:53.710> that<00:01:54.710> other<00:01:54.860> five

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.160 
this 54 from 87 and that other five

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.600 
this 54 from 87 and that other five
course<00:01:55.460> if<00:01:55.640> you<00:01:55.760> remember<00:01:56.060> from<00:01:56.090> 77<00:01:57.020> they're

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
course if you remember from 77 they're

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.430 
course if you remember from 77 they're
practically<00:01:58.610> identical<00:01:59.080> except<00:02:00.080> one<00:02:00.410> has

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
practically identical except one has

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.780 
practically identical except one has
breaker<00:02:00.920> points<00:02:01.190> and<00:02:01.490> one<00:02:01.670> doesn't<00:02:03.340> all<00:02:04.340> parts

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
breaker points and one doesn't all parts

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.430 
breaker points and one doesn't all parts
are<00:02:04.880> interchangeable<00:02:05.030> boars<00:02:05.900> are<00:02:06.080> the<00:02:06.200> same

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
are interchangeable boars are the same

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.230 
are interchangeable boars are the same
strokes<00:02:07.070> are<00:02:07.250> the<00:02:07.340> same<00:02:07.610> valves<00:02:08.479> of<00:02:08.570> the<00:02:08.600> same

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
strokes are the same valves of the same

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.030 
strokes are the same valves of the same
almost<00:02:11.240> everything<00:02:12.140> interesting<00:02:12.320> governors

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
almost everything interesting governors

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.790 
almost everything interesting governors
are<00:02:13.220> saying<00:02:13.430> it<00:02:13.640> cranks<00:02:13.970> the<00:02:14.060> same<00:02:14.330> I<00:02:14.800> haven't

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
are saying it cranks the same I haven't

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.490 
are saying it cranks the same I haven't
measured<00:02:15.980> the<00:02:16.430> casting<00:02:17.240> rod<00:02:17.420> or<00:02:17.810> the<00:02:17.990> anything

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
measured the casting rod or the anything

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.710 
measured the casting rod or the anything
like<00:02:18.650> that<00:02:18.680> but<00:02:19.150> they're<00:02:20.150> probably<00:02:20.330> the<00:02:20.510> same

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
like that but they're probably the same

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.180 
like that but they're probably the same
to<00:02:20.900> these<00:02:21.080> camshafts<00:02:21.800> the<00:02:21.890> same<00:02:22.900> so<00:02:24.190> that's

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
to these camshafts the same so that's

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:37.650 
to these camshafts the same so that's
interesting<00:02:35.410> the<00:02:36.410> valves<00:02:36.770> don't<00:02:36.950> look<00:02:37.100> bad

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
interesting the valves don't look bad

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.220 
interesting the valves don't look bad
means<00:02:39.850> now<00:02:40.850> apparently<00:02:41.540> the<00:02:41.720> only<00:02:41.810> problem

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
means now apparently the only problem

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.190 
means now apparently the only problem
with<00:02:42.350> this<00:02:42.440> engine<00:02:42.680> is<00:02:42.950> the<00:02:43.959> fact<00:02:44.959> that<00:02:45.080> the

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
with this engine is the fact that the

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.350 
with this engine is the fact that the
casting<00:02:45.650> notice<00:02:45.950> is<00:02:46.100> uh<00:02:46.310> there's<00:02:47.150> my

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
casting notice is uh there's my

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.390 
casting notice is uh there's my
compressor<00:02:47.720> gallon<00:02:48.200> is<00:02:48.320> the<00:02:49.010> fact<00:02:49.250> the

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
compressor gallon is the fact the

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.730 
compressor gallon is the fact the
compressor<00:02:50.030> the<00:02:50.240> fact<00:02:51.200> that<00:02:51.410> there's

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:51.740 
compressor the fact that there's

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:57.190 
compressor the fact that there's
connecting<00:02:52.310> rod<00:02:52.490> is<00:02:52.640> thrown<00:02:54.130> around<00:02:55.130> I<00:02:56.200> mean

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
connecting rod is thrown around I mean

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.830 
connecting rod is thrown around I mean
