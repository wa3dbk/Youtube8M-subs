technically<00:00:06.569> it<00:00:06.839> should<00:00:07.140> be<00:00:07.290> episode<00:00:07.710> eight

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
technically it should be episode eight

technically it should be episode eight
and<00:00:08.189> that's<00:00:08.760> because<00:00:09.150> I<00:00:09.179> didn't<00:00:09.599> have<00:00:09.719> time<00:00:09.900> to

I just thought I may as well put

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.160 
I just thought I may as well put
everything<00:00:17.910> I've<00:00:18.150> done<00:00:18.330> so<00:00:18.510> far<00:00:18.539> into<00:00:18.960> next

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
everything I've done so far into next

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.500 
everything I've done so far into next
week's<00:00:19.410> episode<00:00:19.590> I<00:00:20.039> also<00:00:20.850> need<00:00:21.180> to<00:00:21.210> apologize

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
week's episode I also need to apologize

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.320 
week's episode I also need to apologize
for<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.260> video<00:00:22.590> I<00:00:22.650> promised<00:00:23.189> to<00:00:23.340> make<00:00:23.490> for<00:00:23.730> 500

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
for the video I promised to make for 500

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.599 
for the video I promised to make for 500
subs<00:00:24.570> which<00:00:24.930> I<00:00:25.080> never<00:00:25.140> made<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:25.740> I'm<00:00:26.400> now

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
subs which I never made and I'm now

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.419 
subs which I never made and I'm now
nearer<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:27.090> 600<00:00:27.720> subs<00:00:27.930> than<00:00:28.170> 500<00:00:28.740> so<00:00:29.340> it

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
nearer to 600 subs than 500 so it

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.740 
nearer to 600 subs than 500 so it
doesn't<00:00:29.699> really<00:00:29.760> make<00:00:30.060> sense<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.390> upload<00:00:30.720> a

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
doesn't really make sense to upload a

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.990 
doesn't really make sense to upload a
500<00:00:31.410> subs<00:00:31.619> video<00:00:31.980> it<00:00:32.279> will<00:00:32.489> probably<00:00:32.700> be

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
500 subs video it will probably be

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.170 
500 subs video it will probably be
nearer<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.530> 650<00:00:34.530> or<00:00:34.710> 700<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:35.550> my<00:00:35.640> guess<00:00:35.880> by<00:00:36.059> the

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
nearer to 650 or 700 and my guess by the

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.479 
nearer to 650 or 700 and my guess by the
time<00:00:36.239> I<00:00:36.390> upload<00:00:36.660> this<00:00:37.050> special<00:00:37.530> so<00:00:38.219> I'll<00:00:38.340> just

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
time I upload this special so I'll just

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.069 
time I upload this special so I'll just
call<00:00:38.670> it<00:00:38.730> however<00:00:39.149> many<00:00:39.270> subscribers<00:00:39.840> I<00:00:40.050> have

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:45.610 
look of at the moment is the chapel I've

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:48.579 
look of at the moment is the chapel I've
actually<00:06:46.610> used<00:06:46.939> the<00:06:47.360> same<00:06:47.629> window<00:06:48.079> textures

that<00:06:48.619> we<00:06:48.829> used<00:06:49.039> in<00:06:49.249> Oblivion<00:06:49.549> so<00:06:50.419> that's<00:06:50.599> why

00:06:50.769 --> 00:06:50.779 
that we used in Oblivion so that's why

00:06:50.779 --> 00:06:56.939 
that we used in Oblivion so that's why
it<00:06:50.839> probably<00:06:51.079> looks<00:06:51.499> a<00:06:51.589> bit<00:06:51.619> familiar<00:06:52.129> to<00:06:52.219> you

00:06:56.939 --> 00:06:56.949
