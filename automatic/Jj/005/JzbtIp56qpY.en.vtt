00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
percent at a time and yeah because

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.289 
percent at a time and yeah because

a<00:02:33.920> fire<00:02:34.920> i<00:02:35.310> don't<00:02:35.489> know<00:02:35.610> how<00:02:35.640> i<00:02:36.349> think<00:02:37.349> it<00:02:37.440> was

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
a fire i don't know how i think it was

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.880 
a fire i don't know how i think it was
possibly<00:02:41.840> so<00:02:42.840> you<00:02:42.900> just<00:02:43.260> put<00:02:43.349> them<00:02:43.590> in<00:02:43.709> there

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
possibly so you just put them in there

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.020 
possibly so you just put them in there
if<00:02:44.849> you<00:02:44.910> open<00:02:45.239> it<00:02:45.329> they<00:02:45.480> can<00:02:45.660> get<00:02:45.780> out<00:02:45.950> but<00:02:46.950> uh

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
if you open it they can get out but uh

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.849 
if you open it they can get out but uh
they<00:02:48.030> go<00:02:48.239> right<00:02:48.390> here<00:02:48.690> they<00:02:49.079> burn<00:02:50.540> we<00:02:51.859> don't

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:52.859 
they go right here they burn we don't

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:56.089 
they go right here they burn we don't
