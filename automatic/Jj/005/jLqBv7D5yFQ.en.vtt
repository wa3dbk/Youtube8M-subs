dots<00:02:14.700> on<00:02:14.910> the<00:02:15.030> map<00:02:15.060> but<00:02:15.570> I<00:02:15.690> don't<00:02:15.900> know<00:02:16.080> quite

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
dots on the map but I don't know quite

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.130 
dots on the map but I don't know quite
whoops<00:02:16.950> what's<00:02:17.610> what<00:02:17.940> I<00:02:18.239> didn't<00:02:18.750> like<00:02:18.930> that

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
whoops what's what I didn't like that

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:26.880 
whoops what's what I didn't like that
tree

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.140 

um

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.289 

so<00:02:32.810> that<00:02:33.110> dot<00:02:33.379> is<00:02:33.560> the<00:02:33.739> that<00:02:34.640> tree<00:02:34.909> is<00:02:34.970> the<00:02:35.120> dot

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 
so that dot is the that tree is the dot

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:38.920 
so that dot is the that tree is the dot
on<00:02:35.480> the<00:02:35.510> map<00:02:35.599> maybe<00:02:35.989> I<00:02:36.319> don't<00:02:36.709> know<00:02:37.780> them<00:02:38.780> I

I<00:03:55.720> do<00:03:56.320> like<00:03:56.530> the<00:03:56.650> graphics<00:03:56.860> though<00:03:57.250> I<00:03:57.490> mean

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
I do like the graphics though I mean

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.820 
I do like the graphics though I mean
I've<00:03:57.820> said<00:03:58.000> it<00:03:58.120> many<00:03:58.480> times<00:03:58.660> before<00:03:59.140> I<00:03:59.590> like

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830 
I've said it many times before I like

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:03.960 
I've said it many times before I like
flat<00:04:00.190> shaded<00:04:00.670> polygons<00:04:02.190> they<00:04:03.190> just<00:04:03.580> create<00:04:03.880> a

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
flat shaded polygons they just create a

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.010 
flat shaded polygons they just create a
kind<00:04:04.120> of<00:04:04.270> atmosphere<00:04:04.570> that<00:04:05.320> I<00:04:06.300> like<00:04:07.300> it<00:04:07.750> looks

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:08.020 
kind of atmosphere that I like it looks

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.820 
kind of atmosphere that I like it looks
futuristic<00:04:08.260> in<00:04:08.920> a<00:04:09.010> very<00:04:09.190> retro<00:04:09.520> kind<00:04:10.000> of<00:04:10.180> way

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
futuristic in a very retro kind of way

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:17.559 
futuristic in a very retro kind of way
it<00:04:11.830> makes<00:04:12.040> no<00:04:12.130> sense<00:04:12.250> whatsoever

00:04:17.559 --> 00:04:17.569 

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:32.920 

ok

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:41.279 

Oh

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:41.289 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:44.450 

where<00:04:41.949> is<00:04:42.099> he<00:04:42.219> going

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
where is he going

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
where is he going
all<00:04:45.460> right<00:04:45.760> kill<00:04:46.150> him<00:04:47.070> or<00:04:48.070> not<00:04:48.310> if<00:04:48.970> I'm<00:04:49.180> find

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:49.480 
all right kill him or not if I'm find

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:58.700 
all right kill him or not if I'm find
him

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:04.610 

yes<00:05:01.520> have<00:05:02.520> some<00:05:02.550> of<00:05:03.090> those<00:05:03.210> kind<00:05:04.080> of<00:05:04.170> weird<00:05:04.380> was

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
yes have some of those kind of weird was

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:10.460 
yes have some of those kind of weird was
it<00:05:05.750> does<00:05:06.750> weird<00:05:06.990> stuff<00:05:09.050> graphically<00:05:10.050> kind<00:05:10.350> of

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.470 
it does weird stuff graphically kind of

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.370 
it does weird stuff graphically kind of
odd<00:05:10.650> I<00:05:10.980> don't<00:05:11.820> that<00:05:12.450> there's<00:05:12.960> that<00:05:13.020> weird

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
odd I don't that there's that weird

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:14.960 
odd I don't that there's that weird
thing<00:05:13.650> up<00:05:13.770> there<00:05:13.800> on<00:05:14.070> the<00:05:14.220> left<00:05:14.430> actually<00:05:14.700> it's

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
thing up there on the left actually it's

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:16.790 
thing up there on the left actually it's
like<00:05:15.000> an<00:05:15.210> artificial<00:05:15.750> horizon<00:05:15.900> which<00:05:16.470> I<00:05:16.620> guess

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
like an artificial horizon which I guess

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.770 
like an artificial horizon which I guess
makes<00:05:16.830> sense<00:05:17.340> if<00:05:17.490> you<00:05:17.520> are<00:05:17.880> in<00:05:18.120> a<00:05:18.210> plane<00:05:18.510> but

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 
makes sense if you are in a plane but

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.990 
makes sense if you are in a plane but
I'm<00:05:18.900> in<00:05:19.020> a<00:05:19.050> tank<00:05:19.410> so<00:05:20.160> I<00:05:20.190> don't<00:05:20.280> know<00:05:20.490> why<00:05:20.790> does

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
I'm in a tank so I don't know why does

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.380 
I'm in a tank so I don't know why does
not<00:05:21.150> official<00:05:21.600> horizon<00:05:22.110> but<00:05:22.950> well<00:05:26.390> nevermind

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:27.390 
not official horizon but well nevermind

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:33.800 
not official horizon but well nevermind
I<00:05:29.420> there's<00:05:30.420> a<00:05:30.570> gazebo<00:05:30.870> let's<00:05:31.680> just<00:05:31.800> an<00:05:32.810> part

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 
I there's a gazebo let's just an part

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.080 
I there's a gazebo let's just an part

Stonehenge we're gonna we're going to
blow<00:05:36.240> up<00:05:36.300> the<00:05:36.450> gazebo<00:05:37.310> because<00:05:38.310> i<00:05:38.430> don't<00:05:38.670> like

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:39.290 
blow up the gazebo because i don't like

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:46.280 
blow up the gazebo because i don't like
emergency<00:05:40.290> why<00:05:42.470> why<00:05:43.470> is<00:05:43.530> it<00:05:43.770> an<00:05:43.890> emergency<00:05:45.290> am

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:54.830 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.970 

or<00:05:55.340> am<00:05:55.520> I<00:05:55.640> just<00:05:55.670> like<00:05:56.290> is<00:05:57.290> there<00:05:57.500> some<00:05:57.680> kind<00:05:57.710> of

or am I just like is there some kind of

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.200 
or am I just like is there some kind of
impending<00:05:58.520> loss<00:05:59.000> of<00:05:59.270> game<00:05:59.510> approaching<00:06:00.410> three

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.210 
impending loss of game approaching three

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:04.390 
impending loss of game approaching three
yeah<00:06:02.210> that<00:06:02.540> kind<00:06:02.870> of<00:06:03.050> loss<00:06:03.410> of<00:06:03.650> game<00:06:03.950> for<00:06:04.310> no

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 
yeah that kind of loss of game for no

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.790 
yeah that kind of loss of game for no
apparent<00:06:04.850> reason<00:06:04.910> I<00:06:06.670> don't<00:06:07.670> know<00:06:07.940> why<00:06:08.060> I

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:08.800 
apparent reason I don't know why I

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.050 
apparent reason I don't know why I
almost<00:06:09.800> think<00:06:10.010> it<00:06:10.190> wasn't<00:06:10.340> doing<00:06:10.550> something

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:11.060 
almost think it wasn't doing something

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.390 
almost think it wasn't doing something
right<00:06:11.240> but<00:06:11.540> that's<00:06:11.660> kind<00:06:12.080> of<00:06:12.170> a<00:06:12.290> given<00:06:12.590> so<00:06:13.130> that

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:13.400 
right but that's kind of a given so that

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.680 
right but that's kind of a given so that
is<00:06:13.550> air<00:06:13.760> supremacy<00:06:14.180> in<00:06:14.780> a<00:06:15.380> tank<00:06:15.700> hmm<00:06:16.700> i<00:06:16.880> don't

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:17.690 
is air supremacy in a tank hmm i don't

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:19.750 
is air supremacy in a tank hmm i don't
get<00:06:18.080> it<00:06:18.230> i<00:06:18.380> would<00:06:18.770> need<00:06:18.950> instructions<00:06:19.610> to

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:19.760 
get it i would need instructions to

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.700 
get it i would need instructions to
really<00:06:20.030> have<00:06:20.180> half<00:06:20.450> a<00:06:20.600> clue<00:06:20.810> and<00:06:21.200> i<00:06:21.410> haven't

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:21.710 
really have half a clue and i haven't

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:25.240 
really have half a clue and i haven't
got<00:06:21.830> any<00:06:22.070> so<00:06:22.990> it's<00:06:23.990> the<00:06:24.170> usual<00:06:24.320> story<00:06:24.770> looks
