00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
much smoother that runs but I know some

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.199 
much smoother that runs but I know some
of<00:03:24.870> you<00:03:25.050> are<00:03:25.140> saying<00:03:25.349> look<00:03:26.010> Jessie<00:03:26.610> the<00:03:26.760> FPS<00:03:27.060> is

better<00:03:27.390> okay<00:03:27.720> but<00:03:27.959> graphically<00:03:28.860> so<00:03:29.610> what<00:03:29.849> it

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
better okay but graphically so what it

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.300 
better okay but graphically so what it
looks<00:03:30.450> the<00:03:30.720> same<00:03:30.930> pretty<00:03:31.140> much<00:03:31.230> and<00:03:31.620> to<00:03:32.160> that<00:03:32.280> I

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
looks the same pretty much and to that I

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.009 
looks the same pretty much and to that I
say<00:03:32.489> you<00:03:33.000> know<00:03:33.090> what<00:03:33.239> you're<00:03:33.330> probably<00:03:33.480> right

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
recording the video looks clunky and

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.530 
recording the video looks clunky and
even<00:04:01.860> worse<00:04:02.040> it<00:04:02.250> was<00:04:02.310> just<00:04:02.549> dark<00:04:02.970> and<00:04:03.299> empty

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
even worse it was just dark and empty

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.750 
even worse it was just dark and empty
and<00:04:04.049> you'll<00:04:04.590> notice<00:04:04.860> the<00:04:05.010> footage<00:04:05.280> I<00:04:05.370> chose<00:04:05.579> to

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
and you'll notice the footage I chose to

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.610 
and you'll notice the footage I chose to
use<00:04:05.790> is<00:04:06.209> throwing<00:04:06.480> a<00:04:06.540> depth<00:04:06.810> rift<00:04:07.079> invasion

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
use is throwing a depth rift invasion

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.620 
use is throwing a depth rift invasion
why<00:04:07.920> well<00:04:08.489> it's<00:04:08.819> because<00:04:09.120> during<00:04:09.299> a<00:04:09.420> death

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
why well it's because during a death

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.500 
why well it's because during a death
rift<00:04:09.870> invasion<00:04:10.349> the<00:04:11.010> world<00:04:11.310> gets<00:04:11.640> so<00:04:11.910> dark<00:04:12.239> and

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
rift invasion the world gets so dark and

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.150 
rift invasion the world gets so dark and
covered<00:04:12.780> in<00:04:12.870> shadow<00:04:13.170> then<00:04:13.650> it's<00:04:13.769> probably<00:04:14.040> the

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
covered in shadow then it's probably the

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.789 
covered in shadow then it's probably the
best<00:04:14.489> situation<00:04:15.060> to<00:04:15.150> record<00:04:15.540> with<00:04:15.959> my<00:04:16.109> old<00:04:16.320> GPU

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
best situation to record with my old GPU

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.219 
best situation to record with my old GPU
because<00:04:17.190> you<00:04:17.760> couldn't<00:04:18.120> see<00:04:18.389> very<00:04:18.419> far<00:04:18.870> anyway

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
because you couldn't see very far anyway

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:21.020 
because you couldn't see very far anyway
so<00:04:19.739> the<00:04:19.889> graphics<00:04:20.340> didn't<00:04:20.579> have<00:04:20.700> to<00:04:20.820> render

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
so the graphics didn't have to render

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.469 
so the graphics didn't have to render
much<00:04:21.359> it's<00:04:21.720> really<00:04:22.410> kind<00:04:22.830> of<00:04:22.950> pathetic<00:04:23.479> now

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
much it's really kind of pathetic now

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:27.110 
much it's really kind of pathetic now
take<00:04:24.780> a<00:04:24.810> look<00:04:24.960> with<00:04:25.080> the<00:04:25.139> 590<00:04:25.800> there<00:04:26.430> is<00:04:26.610> so

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
take a look with the 590 there is so

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.570 
take a look with the 590 there is so
much<00:04:27.389> more<00:04:27.720> going<00:04:27.960> on<00:04:28.229> and<00:04:28.530> so<00:04:29.070> much<00:04:29.220> more<00:04:29.460> to
