00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:20.390
 Hi, my friends, today I am going to teach you 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:23.940
 prepare this cauliflower to the Mexican 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:27.050
 are the cauliflower are these 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:30.849
 my mom gave them that little tree 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:34.340
 it comes as well as if it was placed as 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:35.480
 cabbage like cabbage like many what 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.280
 know 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:41.269
 this is the cauliflower they can get 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:44.480
 in the market or also in stores 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:48.500
 of self - service they sell it 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:50.840
 I bought half of a cauliflower that 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:54.590
 it's starting roughly like 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:58.120
 half kilogram good then this is 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:01.180
 they are 500 grams of cauliflower 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:04.269
 we will use oaxaca cheese already 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:08.550
 desirable are 200 200 grams of cheese 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:13.930
 oaxaca 5 tomatoes 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:17.440
 here are the tomatoes 5 are medium 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:20.170
 between medium guys a chile a chile 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.030
 green to give it an epic touch he cited and 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.230
 half onion also takes down but 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.680
 The truth is that I already know 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.910
 finished the garlic and can not 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.470
 get but nothing else I'm going to throw 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:34.620
 onion does not matter this one 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.650
 let's use oil to fry and 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.680
 consume chicken 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.290
 consume chicken 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.380
 and so much water 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:47.650
 and to boil the tomatoes 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:51.930
 well let's start in a fret we're going 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.930
 to add this water 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:01.950
 a little water and here we go to 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:04.110
 incorporate the tomatoes I'm going to 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.610
 put the good because if I molo in 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:11.850
 this is going to know a little bit this 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:15.300
 I sour the sauce and I do not want it to be 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:18.180
 I'm doing it like that for 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.130
 grind them because to me let me tell you 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:24.090
 that my husband does not like the tomato 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:27.660
 then it 's the only way I know what 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:30.209
 I can give is ground not not always chopped 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:33.360
 when the Mexican was the same 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:36.570
 Most are chopped but I will be 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.300
 ground if you like it chopped what 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.440
 they can sting 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:44.240
 in cubes 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.240
 good we are going to leave the ruin 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.680
 good friends as you see they are already known 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.560
 our tomatoes 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.090
 now we are going to enter our 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:03:00.069
 Blender tumbler 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:03.700
 and we're going to liquefy them in the blender 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:07.080
 and we are going to enter the tomatoes 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.080
 together with the chile 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.710
 here 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:19.610
 we are going to add the juice where the 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.610
 two we met 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.090
 we add it 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.069
 and we also add 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:43.100
 our onion and if they have a garlic 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:43.100
 well let's put it to liquefy 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.170
 all right 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:53.230
 Well, it's already liquefied 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:56.849
 our sauce 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.849
 it's a little bit spicy 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.730
 in a separate pan 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:05.959
 here is our pan 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.959
 let's add 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.870
 about 4 teaspoons of oil 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.470
 this is going to be to fry our sauce 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.470
 everyone 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.570
 3 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:23.230
 and 4 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.840
 well we are going to let you warm 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:28.560
 I did not have hot ever then I go 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:31.390
 to let it warm up a little 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:36.850
 since it's hot we're going to add 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:39.340
 our sauce a little friend is already good 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:42.720
 hot our casserole now let's 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.720
 add the sauce 

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:50.810
 that sound is what 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:54.260
 My mom says that if it does not sound like 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:57.200
 casserole is because women do not know 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:59.150
 cooking has also gone through several phases 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:03.110
 but still I have been tasty 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:05.900
 good food let's leave it there and go 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:08.600
 to add a teaspoon of the consume 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:12.280
 a spoonful of consumed a teaspoon 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.280
 about chicken bouillon 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:24.040
 and we revolve it 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:28.660
 but we let it season well 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:28.660
 about 10 minutes 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:34.349
 and then add the good cauliflower 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:38.309
 friends, our sauce is already here 

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:40.610
 is already boiling fat is already here 

00:05:38.309 --> 00:05:40.610
 arribita 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:45.380
 they say that when the fat is up it is 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:48.740
 because our season is already well-seasoned 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:51.920
 sauce or what we do then good 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:55.270
 let's add the cauliflower 

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.270
 let's incorporate it 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:09.060
 and we stir the let's leave 

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:11.440
 this that that thing that is good cause that 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:14.980
 lie down 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:17.720
 so we do not add more water or anything 

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:20.510
 Well, just stay that way 

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:24.500
 around about 10 minutes because this 

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:28.460
 it sews very fast then also to me 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:31.250
 I like it to be a little crispy 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:33.400
 then let's leave it around 10 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:33.400
 minutes 

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:39.420
 good friends as you can see it's already in 

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:42.170
 our cauliflower and it's cooked 

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:42.170
 here they are 

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:50.070
 this little one now what we 're going to do 

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:52.440
 this yields as for three functions 

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:54.800
 Now what we are going to do is we are going to 

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.800
 pay 

00:06:56.559 --> 00:07:02.000
 we turn off 

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:08.020
 and let's sprinkle oaxaca cheese 

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:08.020
 good to incorporate the oaxaca cheese 

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:11.460
 A) Yes 

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:24.489
 and we cover it with steam it's going to 

00:07:22.039 --> 00:07:24.489
 gratin 

00:07:25.449 --> 00:07:33.189
 good friends, I hope you liked it 

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:36.370
 this recipe I'm going to leave a link to 

00:07:33.189 --> 00:07:38.849
 to see what properties the 

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:38.849
 cauliflower 

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:44.690
 to eat it because there are many 

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:48.930
 people who do not eat it because the 

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:52.560
 scarce causes gas in the stomach 

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:55.110
 but the truth is very rich in fiber and 

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:58.199
 many other things more according to me 

00:07:55.110 --> 00:08:02.060
 I investigated served for the kidneys and 

00:07:58.199 --> 00:08:05.039
 then to eat a lot of cauliflower comes out 

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:07.310
 take care a lot and I hope you like this one 

00:08:05.039 --> 00:08:07.310
