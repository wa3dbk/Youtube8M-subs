00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.990
 hello everyone in today's video I'm going to 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.240
 show you the difference there is when 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.370
 we record with 60 frames per second or 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.350
 30 frames per second we already do 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.420
 slow motion editing the video going down 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.250
 the reproduction speed if you want 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.650
 see the first sequence at 60 frames 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.029
 per second given the cogwheel that is 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.820
 find down to the right and 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.769
 select 1080p at 60 frames per 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.570
 second if you have already selected this 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.189
 now you will be seeing the image of the 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.739
 left at 60 frames per second 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.420
 real is the difference with the image of 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.329
 the right resident that the movement of 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.219
 the image is smoother and more fluid now 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.160
 let's see the same image but with the 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.140
 playback speed at 75% at 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.180
 left we are seeing 45 frames 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.160
 per real seconds and to the right 22 and 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.570
 half real we return to it 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.149
 sequence but with the speed of 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.559
 50% reproduction this time at 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.179
 slow down in half to 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.280
 perform slow motion to the left 

00:00:57.179 --> 00:01:01.170
 we have 30 real frames per second 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.640
 from right wing playback to 15 it 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.530
 note a little that the image on the right 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.180
 is less fluid than the one on the left and 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.640
 we lower the playback speed to 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.470
 25% the difference becomes more noticeable 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.299
 is the image recorded at 30 frames 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.140
 per second is showing seven 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.180
 images and media 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.680
 second this makes that we can already 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.180
 appreciate how the movement of 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.890
 cars is not fluid as it gives the 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.780
 feeling that we have taken pictures 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.570
 very fast and we have put them together in a 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.520
 video this shows that the more 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.010
 frames per second we capture in a 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.170
 slower video we can reproduce it with 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.700
 a better result and finally finally if 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.190
 we leave the playback speed in 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.810
 10% in both cases the result is not 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.640
 nothing fluid since to the left 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.800
 we have 6 frames per second and the 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.540
 right 3 to perform the calculation of 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.100
 the actual frames per second that 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.720
 we are left when we do slow motion 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.729
 it's very easy in this case like I left 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.110
 the speed by 10% simply 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.700
 we have to multiply the frames by 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.310
 second to which our 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.130
 video by 0.1 when it is 50% 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.619
 multiply by 0.5 if it is 75 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.450
 cent by 0.75 in this way we can 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.250
 calculate how far we can reduce the 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.810
 speed for slow motion to be 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.520
 fluid 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.410
 normally we should leave it in 25 or 30 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.119
 frames per second is the minimum 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.700
 we need for our eye to see a 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.230
 smooth and fluid movement I hope that 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.300
