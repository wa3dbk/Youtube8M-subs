apples<00:00:53.730> still<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:53.969> little<00:00:54.149> bit<00:00:54.329> slow<00:00:54.660> here<00:00:55.050> in

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
apples still a little bit slow here in

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:30.170 
apples still a little bit slow here in
iOS<00:00:55.800> 7<00:01:00.590> let's<00:01:01.590> put<00:01:02.070> them<00:01:02.129> up

there we go okay so Apple do actually be
here<00:01:34.500> in<00:01:34.710> terms<00:01:35.190> of<00:01:35.460> speed<00:01:35.880> I<00:01:36.750> think<00:01:37.410> they<00:01:37.530> must

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
here in terms of speed I think they must

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.640 
here in terms of speed I think they must
have<00:01:37.800> improved<00:01:38.190> feel<00:01:38.520> often<00:01:39.440> compared<00:01:40.440> to

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
have improved feel often compared to

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.280 
have improved feel often compared to

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
earlier betas which definitely has been

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.550 
earlier betas which definitely has been
slower<00:01:43.680> but<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.790> new<00:01:44.910> iOS<00:01:45.090> 7<00:01:45.630> GM<00:01:45.960> edition<00:01:46.380> here

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
slower but the new iOS 7 GM edition here

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.010 
slower but the new iOS 7 GM edition here
