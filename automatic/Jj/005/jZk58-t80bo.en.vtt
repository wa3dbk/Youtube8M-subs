00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.080 
they come in long bars but that's like a
lifetime<00:02:16.620> supply<00:02:16.829> so<00:02:17.190> what<00:02:17.310> I<00:02:17.340> do<00:02:17.459> is<00:02:17.760> I<00:02:17.910> take

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
lifetime supply so what I do is I take

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.729 
lifetime supply so what I do is I take
and<00:02:18.360> I<00:02:18.420> cut<00:02:18.690> a<00:02:18.720> little<00:02:18.900> bit<00:02:18.989> and<00:02:19.379> this<00:02:19.560> much

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
and I cut a little bit and this much

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.259 
and I cut a little bit and this much
will<00:02:19.980> last<00:02:20.190> you<00:02:20.370> for<00:02:20.519> a<00:02:20.579> long<00:02:20.700> time<00:02:20.940> it's<00:02:21.180> a

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
will last you for a long time it's a

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:22.970 
will last you for a long time it's a
little<00:02:21.510> weight<00:02:21.660> saving<00:02:22.019> tip<00:02:22.170> so<00:02:22.650> we<00:02:22.709> put<00:02:22.890> the

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
little weight saving tip so we put the

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.860 
little weight saving tip so we put the
skis<00:02:23.220> down<00:02:23.519> and<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.150> idea<00:02:24.390> with<00:02:24.510> that<00:02:24.540> is<00:02:24.750> to

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
skis down and the idea with that is to

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.630 
skis down and the idea with that is to
let<00:02:24.989> the<00:02:25.140> skins<00:02:25.410> warm<00:02:25.709> up<00:02:25.890> a<00:02:26.010> little<00:02:26.099> bit<00:02:26.250> that

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
let the skins warm up a little bit that

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.729 
let the skins warm up a little bit that
way<00:02:26.760> they<00:02:26.910> take<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.239> wax<00:02:27.450> so<00:02:28.379> when<00:02:28.500> it's<00:02:28.620> time

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
way they take the wax so when it's time

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.430 
way they take the wax so when it's time
to<00:02:28.829> put<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:29.099> wax<00:02:29.280> on<00:02:29.549> don't<00:02:30.420> be<00:02:30.599> bashful<00:02:30.629> take

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
to put the wax on don't be bashful take

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.410 
to put the wax on don't be bashful take
this<00:02:31.590> stuff<00:02:34.010> all<00:02:35.010> directions<00:02:35.609> if<00:02:36.030> you<00:02:36.150> don't

that's what the scraping does is trying

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.640 
that's what the scraping does is trying
