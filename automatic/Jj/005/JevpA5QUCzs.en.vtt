00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:08.040
 here we have an onofre refrigerator 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.500
 opening the freezer door that 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:14.309
 We are at the top will be able 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:17.970
 dismantle and explain the operation 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.910
 of this removing that screw that we see 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.119
 in the back cover we can remove this 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:28.890
 and removing these two we can also 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:31.050
 Remove the lid from the bottom too 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.730
 we are going to disassemble the display so that 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.530
 see the electronic board and the 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.840
 omnova switch removing these two 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:41.760
 screws that are two 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.760
 let's proceed to remove it 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.220
 here we can see that we have already removed 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.230
 the two covers both the back and the 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.670
 lead 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.880
 we can see all the waves that it has 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.790
 we removed this cork and we found 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:59.100
 directly the fan the evaporator 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:01.739
 here we have a temperature probe 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.140
 work for the refrigerator and from here 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.270
 we have several waves one of frost and 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.100
 another temperature feed for the 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.060
 fan and for the resistance 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.060
 of frost 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.080
 let's remove the lid that protects the 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.080
 evaporator 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:24.910
 and here we can see that it is embedded 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:27.780
 in the evaporator the ice probe and the 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.780
 frost probe 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.940
 up here as we see we have removed the 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.220
 two screws and we have the plate 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.990
 electronics in which he governs and sends 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.760
 all signals and receives all the 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.760
 refrigerator information 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.920
 here we have several cables 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:56.250
 feeding the brown and blue 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.710
 black comes from 'clicks' although it is the 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.520
 Over temperature protection 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:06.770
 compressor the browns these are the 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.770
 ignition switch off 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.319
 and now let's explain what is the 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.020
 functioning 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:17.130
 of the refrigerator 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.870
 here we have the electronic board 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.470
 from the front once removed 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.470
 the plastic housing 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:28.050
 to explain the operation of a 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.210
 refrigerator should know that consists of 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.590
 several parts including the evaporator 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.590
 what is that we have here 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.659
 the one in charge where the cold is produced in 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.459
 the refrigerator here we have the 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:44.569
 capacitor that is the battery that is 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:48.700
 in the back 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:48.700
 here in the song 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.830
 and here the compressor 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.129
 the compressor started applying the 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.989
 compressor has an input that is a 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:04.930
 little wider than the low part 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:08.110
 pressure where it reaches the gas and the 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.590
 compressor drives it to a high 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.840
 temperature and high pressure 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.610
 continues for power he had the check 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.170
 we see and 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.640
 and it would go into the battery of 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.690
 capacitors to which the bacteria 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.330
 condenser 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.670
 what we do is take advantage of the air 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:26.250
 ambient air to subtract 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.080
 temperature then it would come out of the 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.060
 battery with high pressure and low 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.880
 temperature by means of obstruction 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:36.990
 let's check with a smaller tube and 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:40.590
 then open the way what we do 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:44.610
 the expansion we transform the liquid into 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:46.830
 steam and at low temperature would raise the 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.720
 pipeline we do not see it because it's behind 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.260
 of the refrigerator by this tube here and 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.630
 would come to the evaporator here is where 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.130
 we cool to the refrigerator genre and 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:59.100
 would return again to the 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:01.410
 compressor and here the cycle would end 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.910
 of cold we have here a fan that 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.860
 is in charge of driving the 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.860
 top of the freezer the air 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:13.500
 as in the bottom 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:15.180
 to refrigerate the two parts and here 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.660
 we can see that through this 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.970
 hole and this trapdoor that you have here 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.889
 along with the others that they have here 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:26.909
 below is where the air drives 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:26.909
 the fan
