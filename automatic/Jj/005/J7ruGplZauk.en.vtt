00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.610
 to admire fuels and relive it even offers you a 

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:06.760
 alternative to roll so maybe 

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.790
 more economical maybe maybe but she like I wanted to ask 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.790
 did you appeal to security because to properly demonstrate this 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.230
 that blues lpj the French ranks 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.400
 the LPG the liquefied petroleum gas i'm going 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.609
 burn before you to judge yes you have to like people no 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:27.259
 before going back indeed confessed m 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.279
 these of the lpg the agreement 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:35.000
 we are finally going to be talked about but we must not be afraid 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.659
 in the same way then I tried 

00:00:36.659 --> 00:00:40.309
 the the result of 2 and the refining of oil and gas 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:42.800
 lellouche world use every day 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.350
 butane cylinders and propane see that's what we burn it 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.680
 it's lpg game that burns in refineries or in front of what we see 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.780
 systematically that the refineries at master level the cdpj where they are all 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.910
 to do mtg so what 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.970
 the world always the 10 6% 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.500
 especially in the countryside the cylinders of butane and propane 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.390
 also mtg goal so it is a fuel that adapts very easily 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.520
 to cars running on gasoline and paris no problem we pass very 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.130
 easily from gasoline to lpg for diesel attention it's another 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.030
 technology it does not work 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.870
 important it must be installed by a professional adriano the average cost of 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:27.250
 the room insure those of 2005 and 43000 euros profitable easily by weight 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.610
 good yes it is to agree on the calculation in a moment a thing again 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.830
 to say it is the least polluting fuel that we know today 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.480
 currently also although the cheapest fuel this morning I went 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.790
 take a ride to marthon not the gasoline to raise the prices 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.140
 then you see it gasoline ninety-octane octane tetanus euro zone 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:55.590
 659 and the tpg ap 00 954 there is no picture as we have a difference of almost 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.510
 three quarters of euros is huge 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.410
 while we can go further in time in small calculations we can 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:01.580
 make the comparison 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.030
 ride on gasoline or lpg 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.760
 so as a small comparison shows very easily that for a 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:13.590
 average consumption 2008 fast nico 100 km taking into account that one 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.010
 consumes a little more wasted gasoline your facility is depreciated after that 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.970
 57 thousand kilometers okay to you so just to do the math according to 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.560
 your country where women also knew that there are cuts I'm going 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.650
 talk about tax release and the famous discounts on 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.089
 high-tech facilities and so it's good to know that said 

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:33.350
 gold pair because 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.299
 what it entails at once but it does not rank annually 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:40.249
 while the problem that obviously remains by the explosion but also 

00:02:40.249 --> 00:02:42.629
 his reputation wisdom then 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:46.389
 we've also seen some i'm going to show you the advancement of the images of three 

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:49.389
 cars one equipped with a gasoline engine 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:55.260
 a water was judged that's the gasoline engine explodes the mtg in a 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.149
 moment will explode that's very serious 

00:02:58.149 --> 00:02:59.949
 besides right now 

00:02:59.949 --> 00:03:03.679
 the flat anyway and it's a tank it is installed by a 

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:06.899
 cowboy or what he says by a lawyer 

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:09.899
 the ticket now comparing a tank that 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.879
 installed by a licensed professional 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:28.750
 in the secure system there are valves as soon as the pressure nantes 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.900
 instead of exploding the waste of chasing it is built wrongly installed 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.520
 that we find them easily supposes convoys recalled to complete a 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.109
 galley the calculator that you 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:42.060
 so you talked to see if it's profitable the site 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.310
 in euros you can calculate your consumption lpga germany point buemi 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.390
 which also hindered the air assets were launched 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.890
 but it's very profitable actually but also find out 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.160
 that many public car parks prohibited access to documents 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.889
 prevent by 104 8 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:58.589
 so that's not wise you can be very problematic 

00:03:58.589 --> 00:04:01.359
 between the players as we told you at the beginning of broadcast some 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:05.159
 country banned only three days for private vehicles the 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:07.049
 Finland by contrast other countries 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:08.849
 there the round 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:12.749
 germany and especially the thumb the milk installed to follow the journey is also 

00:04:12.749 --> 00:04:15.839
 worries when you have the thalassotherapy pump installed after buying 

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:19.029
 your car you risk pros warranty problem and because the 

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:21.579
 most manufacturers their representatives while subs is 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:24.680
 decidedly very quickly a last figure to finish 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.080
 numbers already makes 4 5 million vehicles in belgium diesel find 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.360
 meaning 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.039
 thirty six thousand 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:34.310
 cars equipped to protect 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.550
 it's a transition fuel 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.930
 but which is too little used then seems to me of three letters lpj 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.360
 we'll go to three more letters
