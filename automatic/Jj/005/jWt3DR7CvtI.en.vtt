00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:57.359 
they've got to such a stage in the

00:02:57.359 --> 00:02:59.869 
they've got to such a stage in the
development<00:02:57.720> of<00:02:58.349> the<00:02:58.650> update<00:02:59.129> you<00:02:59.730> know

development of the update you know
they've<00:03:00.030> got<00:03:00.060> to<00:03:00.329> the<00:03:00.359> stage<00:03:00.690> where<00:03:01.260> it<00:03:01.290> can

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
they've got to the stage where it can

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.759 
they've got to the stage where it can
actually<00:03:02.040> run<00:03:02.340> you<00:03:02.670> know<00:03:02.790> its<00:03:03.470> executable<00:03:04.470> if

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
actually run you know its executable if

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.440 
actually run you know its executable if
they<00:03:04.950> can<00:03:05.129> put<00:03:05.310> it<00:03:05.430> on<00:03:05.549> the<00:03:05.670> game<00:03:05.819> and<00:03:06.120> show<00:03:06.299> it

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
they can put it on the game and show it

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.720 
they can put it on the game and show it
off<00:03:06.569> to<00:03:06.599> everyone<00:03:07.049> and<00:03:07.680> clearly<00:03:08.190> it<00:03:08.370> can't<00:03:08.609> be

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
off to everyone and clearly it can't be

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.630 
off to everyone and clearly it can't be
that<00:03:09.030> buggy<00:03:09.450> clearly<00:03:10.170> it's<00:03:10.319> playable<00:03:10.799> so<00:03:11.489> that

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
that buggy clearly it's playable so that

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.360 
that buggy clearly it's playable so that
means<00:03:11.879> if<00:03:12.390> it's<00:03:12.629> playable<00:03:13.109> it<00:03:13.379> should<00:03:13.769> be<00:03:13.950> very

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
means if it's playable it should be very
