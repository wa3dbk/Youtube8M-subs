 real steam locomotives 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.269
 centenary or so circulating 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.160
 proudly crotoy with kernels on sea 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.290
 from calais saint valery aboard a 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.030
 mechanic and a driver the first 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.260
 drives the machine the second interview 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.390
 fire for it to work 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.800
 the base is coal a beautiful 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.820
 Russian anthracite because they smoke 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.400
 Unless the Polish without being either 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.189
 about 600 kg per day 600 flights between 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.660
 600 and 1000 kg per day depends on 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:37.040
 driver the wind speed the 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:39.600
 mechanics finally are full of factors 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.250
 like almost everyone thanks to whom this 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.290
 train runs arnaud and volunteers 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.440
 passionate about steam fell in all 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.210
 small in the footsteps of a papapio nor the 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.649
 dad it's him charles edouard founder 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.390
 of the railway association of the 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.940
 bay of sum for him the train that's 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:58.260
 also a childhood story we are 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:00.180
 in 55 g forward and if you want I 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.489
 accompany them my father or rather my 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.570
 father tell me come I'm going to the hunt to 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.110
 the hut in sum bay 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.130
 I will show you how we do 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.020
 what happens is what a 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.780
 fight all that so he explains it all to me 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.780
 and then I hear whistling a locomotive 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.859
 two little pictures he always has 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:19.880
 carefully preserved marks the beginning 

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:22.280
 of this thunderbolt 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.929
 this train the peculiarity of circulating 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.609
 on a narrow lane a metric lane 

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:27.439
 so when he learns a few years 

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:29.329
 later in 1969 that the line is 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:30.890
 sentenced charles edouard mobilizes the 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:33.920
 goodwill to save his rails and 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.450
 the precious title was getting ready easily 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.140
 early he did not buy them back from 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.659
 equipment 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.189
 fortunately the wooden cars was 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:41.869
 again there is one left 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:43.939
 dozen but there was therefore to 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:46.130
 medieval steam so we beat the 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:48.409
 campaign and luckily 66 stay there 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.810
 still in points in 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:52.909
 public works companies in 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.179
 the sweets he still remained these 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:57.469
 locomotives 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:58.909
 forty two years later the ritual 

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:00.319
 volunteers is immutable we get 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:05.599
 found for the meal now 

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:07.280
 share the work at the workshop on 

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:08.750
 machines the work would be gone without 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.700
 according to the affinities and 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.170
 skills of everyone the newcomer 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.879
 is welcomed with all he can 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.319
 to offer a day while coming on vacation 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:17.480
 in the corner I fell off 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.590
 in front of black magic a machine he goes 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.090
 regret it and explained to me that 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.769
 it was an association that he 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.139
 wanted and could come if that 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:26.329
 interested me well I will not come with 

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:27.940
 the others and then suddenly I have 

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:30.470
 took my card it's been 7 8 years now 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.060
 and then well I was starting to come 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.410
 odds and ends at the sin workshop mounted on a 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.959
 machine then they got me to pray and then 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.389
 today I drive very high but 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.500
 with a real still great 

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:41.989
 as for the future we can imagine 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.150
 bright active volunteers are close 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.709
 of a hundred often come from far in 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.630
 mechanical or at the controls of a machine 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.730
 we can cross the grandson of 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.019
 charles edouard in his image 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.180
 are the other volunteers who knew 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:56.380
 convey here competence and passion 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.380
 for steam to their children
