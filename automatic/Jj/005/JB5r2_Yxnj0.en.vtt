but in general terms are now looks to be

about 30 to 35 species of lemurs and it

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.699 
about 30 to 35 species of lemurs and it
shows<00:02:07.310> us<00:02:07.520> just<00:02:07.909> what<00:02:08.299> the<00:02:08.690> potential<00:02:09.530> of

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
shows us just what the potential of

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.550 
shows us just what the potential of
primates<00:02:10.220> is<00:02:10.549> to<00:02:11.120> occupy<00:02:11.450> an<00:02:11.720> enormous<00:02:12.290> range
