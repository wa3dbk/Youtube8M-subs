 I would like to check it out 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:38.010
 Because it is the second return trip 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.920
 Why is it so light ? 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:43.210

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.670
 Futon but I wonder if you could understand it differently 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.210
