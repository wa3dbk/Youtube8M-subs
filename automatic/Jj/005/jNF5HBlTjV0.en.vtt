00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
think the headliner should be the

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.940 
think the headliner should be the
Undertaker<00:01:18.119> now<00:01:18.450> Vince<00:01:18.810> McMahon's<00:01:19.229> greatest

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409

sting<00:03:09.080> now<00:03:09.350> I<00:03:09.380> think<00:03:09.709> that<00:03:09.860> if<00:03:10.070> both<00:03:10.490> sting<00:03:11.030> and

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 
sting now I think that if both sting and

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.930 
sting now I think that if both sting and
Taker<00:03:11.840> were<00:03:12.290> inducted<00:03:12.800> at<00:03:13.160> the<00:03:13.340> same<00:03:13.640> time

Taker were inducted at the same time

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.110 
Taker were inducted at the same time
then<00:03:14.750> the<00:03:15.320> inductions<00:03:16.220> would<00:03:16.459> become<00:03:16.850> more

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
then the inductions would become more

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.330 
then the inductions would become more
impactful<00:03:17.870> assuming<00:03:18.650> if<00:03:18.830> they<00:03:19.010> were<00:03:19.070> both

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
impactful assuming if they were both

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.390
