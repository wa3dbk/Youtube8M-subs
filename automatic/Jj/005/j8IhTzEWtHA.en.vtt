00:01:10.529 --> 00:01:10.539 
full range invisible speaker so it's

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:12.989 
full range invisible speaker so it's

so it's primarily for people who want
all<00:01:17.170> the<00:01:17.670> audio<00:01:18.670> quality<00:01:18.909> but<00:01:19.840> they<00:01:19.959> don't

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
all the audio quality but they don't

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.719

want to see the speakers and there and

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:23.669 
want to see the speakers and there and
that<00:01:21.789> might<00:01:22.090> be<00:01:22.119> because<00:01:22.270> they've<00:01:22.659> got<00:01:22.810> listed

00:01:23.669 --> 00:01:23.679 
that might be because they've got listed

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:25.649 
that might be because they've got listed
buildings<00:01:24.130> or<00:01:24.670> primarily<00:01:25.060> they<00:01:25.270> just<00:01:25.450> don't

cluttering<00:01:27.340> up<00:01:27.459> their<00:01:27.579> house<00:01:27.789> we<00:01:28.420> have

00:01:28.589 --> 00:01:28.599 
cluttering up their house we have

00:01:28.599 --> 00:01:32.309 
cluttering up their house we have
transducers<00:01:29.469> that<00:01:30.090> send<00:01:31.090> the<00:01:31.539> sound<00:01:31.840> out<00:01:32.259> of

00:01:32.309 --> 00:01:32.319 
transducers that send the sound out of

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:34.019 
transducers that send the sound out of
the<00:01:32.529> front<00:01:32.740> this<00:01:32.919> gives<00:01:33.159> us<00:01:33.279> mid-range<00:01:33.759> and

00:01:34.019 --> 00:01:34.029 
the front this gives us mid-range and

00:01:34.029 --> 00:01:36.389 
the front this gives us mid-range and
treble<00:01:34.139> but<00:01:35.139> what's<00:01:35.590> specifically<00:01:36.159> good

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:36.399 
treble but what's specifically good

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:37.949 
treble but what's specifically good
about<00:01:36.579> itself<00:01:36.819> acoustic<00:01:37.359> speaker<00:01:37.630> it<00:01:37.779> also

00:01:37.949 --> 00:01:37.959 
about itself acoustic speaker it also

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:40.199 
about itself acoustic speaker it also
has<00:01:38.229> a<00:01:38.259> really<00:01:38.529> good<00:01:38.740> bass<00:01:38.919> response<00:01:39.130> so<00:01:40.060> it

00:01:40.199 --> 00:01:40.209 
has a really good bass response so it

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:44.099 
has a really good bass response so it
works<00:01:40.419> by<00:01:40.749> firing<00:01:41.169> the<00:01:41.999> air<00:01:42.999> moving<00:01:43.840> the<00:01:43.989> air

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:44.109 
works by firing the air moving the air

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:46.830 
works by firing the air moving the air
within<00:01:44.560> a<00:01:44.739> sound<00:01:45.009> box<00:01:45.249> here<00:01:45.639> that<00:01:46.329> then<00:01:46.450> sent

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
within a sound box here that then sent

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.419 
within a sound box here that then sent
out<00:01:47.020> to<00:01:47.200> the<00:01:47.259> front<00:01:47.469> of<00:01:47.590> the<00:01:47.649> speaker<00:01:47.859> so<00:01:48.369> you

00:01:48.419 --> 00:01:48.429 
out to the front of the speaker so you

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.680 
out to the front of the speaker so you
get

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
get

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.900
