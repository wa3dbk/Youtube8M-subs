00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
around the x and a we I can rotate it I

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.160 
around the x and a we I can rotate it I
can<00:01:06.890> scale<00:01:07.160> it<00:01:07.220> i<00:01:07.460> can<00:01:07.730> flip<00:01:08.000> it<00:01:08.060> over<00:01:08.330> convert

what's fun is a tree without quo you
know<00:01:19.040> so<00:01:19.250> leaves<00:01:19.660> so<00:01:20.660> now<00:01:20.810> you<00:01:20.900> can<00:01:20.990> just

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
know so leaves so now you can just

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.790 
know so leaves so now you can just
started<00:01:21.440> stick<00:01:22.010> a<00:01:22.280> few<00:01:22.700> leaves<00:01:22.940> on<00:01:23.210> here<00:01:23.800> if

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:24.800 
started stick a few leaves on here if

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.859 
started stick a few leaves on here if
this<00:01:25.010> is<00:01:25.190> sparse<00:01:25.670> you<00:01:25.850> know<00:01:25.970> this<00:01:26.119> is<00:01:26.150> Vegas<00:01:26.479> so

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
this is sparse you know this is Vegas so

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:28.480 
this is sparse you know this is Vegas so
trim<00:01:27.140> beats<00:01:27.380> you<00:01:27.530> have<00:01:27.680> too<00:01:27.860> many<00:01:27.950> leaves<00:01:28.220> on

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
trim beats you have too many leaves on
