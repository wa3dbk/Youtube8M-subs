00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:19.290 
of the all-time great players in this

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.830 
of the all-time great players in this
game<00:00:19.350> for<00:00:20.040> so<00:00:20.280> you<00:00:20.850> know<00:00:20.910> I<00:00:21.060> hope<00:00:21.390> he<00:00:21.510> does<00:00:21.660> have

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
game for so you know I hope he does have

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.530 
game for so you know I hope he does have
the<00:00:21.930> ball<00:00:22.110> this<00:00:22.260> hands<00:00:22.470> a<00:00:22.620> lot<00:00:23.090> no<00:00:24.090> but<00:00:24.300> at<00:00:24.420> the

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:24.540 
the ball this hands a lot no but at the

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:25.880 
the ball this hands a lot no but at the
same<00:00:24.720> time<00:00:24.870> I<00:00:24.990> think<00:00:25.200> it<00:00:25.290> takes<00:00:25.320> pressure<00:00:25.710> off

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
same time I think it takes pressure off

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.529 
same time I think it takes pressure off
him<00:00:26.130> if<00:00:26.310> someone<00:00:26.580> else<00:00:26.700> can<00:00:26.880> handle<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.390> ball

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
him if someone else can handle the ball

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.029 
him if someone else can handle the ball
and<00:00:27.720> get<00:00:27.870> in<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.110> ball<00:00:28.260> and<00:00:28.440> spots<00:00:28.740> may<00:00:28.980> be

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
and get in the ball and spots may be

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.700 
and get in the ball and spots may be
good<00:00:29.250> unless<00:00:29.370> you<00:00:29.610> more<00:00:29.789> easy<00:00:29.970> baskets<00:00:30.539> Oh<00:00:30.710> at

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
good unless you more easy baskets Oh at

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.529 
good unless you more easy baskets Oh at
the<00:00:31.830> same<00:00:32.009> time<00:00:32.189> maybe<00:00:32.430> create<00:00:32.999> offense<00:00:33.390> for

00:00:33.529 --> 00:00:33.539 
the same time maybe create offense for

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:35.989 
the same time maybe create offense for
other<00:00:33.749> guys<00:00:33.989> so<00:00:34.230> he's<00:00:34.409> not<00:00:34.559> stuck<00:00:34.980> you're<00:00:35.760> so

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:35.999 
other guys so he's not stuck you're so

00:00:35.999 --> 00:00:37.939 
other guys so he's not stuck you're so
often<00:00:36.420> happen<00:00:36.749> to<00:00:36.929> you<00:00:37.350> know<00:00:37.499> to<00:00:37.559> take<00:00:37.739> on

00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:37.949 
often happen to you know to take on

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:40.700 
often happen to you know to take on
water<00:00:38.159> two<00:00:38.429> defenders<00:00:39.019> you<00:00:40.019> know<00:00:40.140> perhaps<00:00:40.409> you

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
water two defenders you know perhaps you

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.009 
water two defenders you know perhaps you
can<00:00:40.859> all<00:00:41.030> make<00:00:42.030> each<00:00:42.210> other<00:00:42.359> better<00:00:42.629> because

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:43.019 
can all make each other better because

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:45.139 
can all make each other better because
of<00:00:43.140> our<00:00:43.230> different<00:00:43.499> skills<00:00:44.129> you<00:00:44.460> know<00:00:44.579> maybe<00:00:45.059> I

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
of our different skills you know maybe I

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.639 
of our different skills you know maybe I
can<00:00:45.390> space<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.809> floor<00:00:45.839> for<00:00:46.170> those<00:00:46.289> big<00:00:46.499> guys

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
can space the floor for those big guys

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.049 
can space the floor for those big guys
maybe<00:00:46.920> they'll<00:00:47.159> create<00:00:47.399> opportunities<00:00:48.030> for

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
maybe they'll create opportunities for

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.549 
maybe they'll create opportunities for
me<00:00:48.329> i'm<00:00:48.420> taking<00:00:48.719> roles<00:00:48.929> because<00:00:49.319> of<00:00:49.440> their

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
me i'm taking roles because of their

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:50.959 
me i'm taking roles because of their
length<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.039> ability<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.460> finish<00:00:50.640> at<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:50.940> rim

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
length and ability to finish at the rim

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.709 
length and ability to finish at the rim
and<00:00:52.280> in<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:53.460> combination<00:00:53.729> will<00:00:54.149> also<00:00:54.510> make

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
and in that combination will also make

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.469 
and in that combination will also make
it<00:00:55.219> you<00:00:56.219> know<00:00:56.339> a<00:00:56.370> little<00:00:56.550> easier<00:00:56.909> for<00:00:57.089> Coney<00:00:57.300> as

00:00:57.469 --> 00:00:57.479 
it you know a little easier for Coney as

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:01.849 
it you know a little easier for Coney as
well<00:00:57.659> so<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:59.030> lot<00:01:00.030> of<00:01:00.059> work<00:01:00.269> to<00:01:00.420> do<00:01:00.569> right<00:01:01.409> now<00:01:01.799> we

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
well so a lot of work to do right now we

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.860 
well so a lot of work to do right now we
can<00:01:02.129> only<00:01:02.219> speculate<00:01:02.729> in

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
can only speculate in

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.170 
can only speculate in
vision<00:01:04.530> but<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:05.220> lot<00:01:05.580> of<00:01:05.610> work<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:05.940> do<00:01:06.060> and

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
vision but a lot of work to do and

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.160 
vision but a lot of work to do and
that's<00:01:06.270> gonna<00:01:06.479> be<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.659> key<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:06.930> any
