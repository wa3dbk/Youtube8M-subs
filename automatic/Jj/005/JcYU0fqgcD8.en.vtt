running<00:00:27.359> for<00:00:27.660> around<00:00:28.560> 50<00:00:28.949> hours<00:00:30.230> so<00:00:31.230> let's

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
running for around 50 hours so let's

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.389 
running for around 50 hours so let's
just<00:00:31.529> simulate<00:00:31.890> wendys<00:00:32.820> d<00:00:32.969> spawns<00:00:34.130> this<00:00:35.130> gets

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
just simulate wendys d spawns this gets

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.340 
just simulate wendys d spawns this gets
sucked<00:00:36.210> in<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:37.309> dispensed<00:00:38.309> again<00:00:39.230> so<00:00:40.230> yeah

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
sucked in and dispensed again so yeah

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.310 
sucked in and dispensed again so yeah
the<00:00:40.559> device<00:00:40.829> is<00:00:41.010> very<00:00:41.160> reliable<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.090> yeah<00:00:43.079> now

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
the device is very reliable and yeah now

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.490 
the device is very reliable and yeah now
let's<00:00:43.500> see<00:00:43.680> how<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:43.860> be<00:00:44.010> at<00:00:44.100> it<00:00:45.079> alright<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.260> get

place it like this set it for ticks then
place<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.420> back<00:02:00.719> there<00:02:01.430> sticky<00:02:02.430> piston<00:02:03.530> block

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
place a back there sticky piston block

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:11.380 
place a back there sticky piston block
then<00:02:06.180> in<00:02:06.719> case<00:02:06.990> this

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390
