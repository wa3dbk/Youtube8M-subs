00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 we throw my butts in the streets by 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.540
 earth yeah besides I was telling myself at 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.309
 how do you manage to make this 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.809
 nerdy side in the videos because 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:14.130
 me next to me I look like patrick 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:16.109
 Sebastian or makes train listening the 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.289
 Cessna culture has luckily you one 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.289
 please 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.780
 indeed there are two kinds of video games 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.670
 those who enrich our culture and 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.290
 the others so of course he'll be 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.970
 question here of classical culture to 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.350
 bourgeois culture the one that is 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.970
 to have good grades at school and 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.739
 be well seen from his contemporaries 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.140
 admire the wound to respect even 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.400
 feared patricians of course we think 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.780
 in the first place to his games at 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.790
 historical references marked in 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.280
 background documents such as the series of 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.050
 quasars of total war is obviously at 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.030
 civilization and its famous civil 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.500
 huge ep10 database filled 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.750
 information about peoples the 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.400
 technologies the story of ideas the 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.770
 more pointed will prefer the exhaustive 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.619
 europa universalis the very sharp art of 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.640
 iron or the scrupulous crusader kings these 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.470
 games still have in common to be 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.580
 intended for an audience of enthusiasts who 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.720
 will be happy to find a backup 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.250
 satisfying its historical culture 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.690
 but the games that will interest us 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.700
 this day are the games that addresses the 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.050
 general public that does not require a 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.880
 expert culture or a pronounced taste 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.950
 for the story things sir 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.869
 Ambassador 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.610
 here is monsieur de faverolles who will you 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.960
 lead in the gardens maybe 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.430
 did you know this series the point'n 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.780
 click pc supposed to teach us plenty of 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.330
 stuff about history like egypt 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.679
 versailles or venice and well it's just 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.959
 is a bit the archetype of the game for 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:41.610
 dads of the 90s for these dads the 

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:42.479
 video games it was the noisy stuff of 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.979
 all the colors you 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.390
 lose of whole afternoon on TV 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.700
 from the living room but on pc 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.740
 there was ps2 games more games 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.890
 video was ok especially if it was meant 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.920
 cultural then look look this is 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:59.729
 awesome it's called lascaux then if that 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.580
 happens in the sport then there his canvas 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:07.110
 is an enigma 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:10.770
 I have a flint I click it's boring 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:14.160
 like drucker your thing aa look i've 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:17.010
 found a pottery I can break it 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.690
 with my hammer rudiments of this 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:24.030
 exciting 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:27.660
 we can learn while having fun a man 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:30.680
 of neandertal and and if i click on the 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.680
 mouth and I can talk to him 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.190
 however admit that those who 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.290
 are interested in these games are rarely 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.240
 those who have the most to learn for 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.290
 flirt with a wider audience you need the 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.910
 dough and with something other than 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.650
 relook dialogues and exact dates there 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.160
 must give him the game of the good game of 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.720
 gameplay 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.430
 for example with regard to the 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.750
 Greek mythology god of war has 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.130
 much more learned to a lot more from 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.300
 world than any point'n'click 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.640
 boring about the war of troy or 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.980
 the odyssey of ulysses then in you 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.450
 pressing the passes of the text of 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.040
 Christian of Troyes extracted from lons the 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.160
 char is and on your knowledge 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.540
 personal knowledge 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.370
 personal that lancelot me it's not going 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.810
 further camelot I may be able to me 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.930
 to load an episode on the phone if 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.830
 I manage to be discreet enough charlier 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.450
 believe maybe I do not see 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.790
 today and maybe surely 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:18.680
 strabismus diverge on my leniency 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.680
 natural is not wrong 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:27.489
 see this poor candlestick well in pain 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.959
 to fill his duplicate copy well 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:30.549
 why is not it all about 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:35.190
 simply to the final fantasy invocations 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:35.190
 I invoke the knights the painting 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:04:02.670
 to have a classical culture 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:04:04.080
 just get out the one who took 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.000
 it is worthwhile to look at the origin of 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.320
 proper names in final fantasy will only have 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.240
 not want to be surprised to find 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:11.100
 sometimes classic references enough 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.630
 pointed that's what was said and 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.540
 wars she finally treated 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:18.209
 I imagine that heidegger wars 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.680
 it's a type of shinra in ffvii and 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.030
 it's not just about wars and final wars 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.740
 fantasy will have made us familiar with 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.810
 many legendary mythical figures 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.900
 such shiva lady august 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.460
 odin gilgamesh ifrit leviathan as many 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.020
 names that will be found amused in the 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.950
 thousand and one nights the mahabharata where 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.930
 Old Testament 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:36.510
 as many founding narratives of the 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.190
 human culture more simply one can 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.200
 think of the jellyfish cyclops at 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.250
 centaur to the minotaur to those monsters who 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.080
 populate our collective imagination 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.820
 for millennia and we find 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.450
 in the novels the poems the works 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.860
 dramatic 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.480
 they are as many references as we 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.620
 can be happy to share with our 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:53.300
 most distant ancestors 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.300
 our most illustrious predecessors 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:02.360
 what do you have to us from the hell of dante 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.360
 it's a good beat them all 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:10.630
 dante inferno despite some freedoms 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.830
 taken from the original work 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.810
 but finally that an adaptation 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.700
 modern and daring hell 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.860
 first part of the divine comedy of 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.210
 dante alighieri a poem worldwide 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.370
 recognized as a masterpiece of the 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.139
 literature a poem probably 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.550
 compose in the 14th century and who himself 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:26.560
 is inspired by the ancient poetry of 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.910
 virgile who himself draw inspiration from the sea 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.889
 and all have in common to use 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:31.720
 always his mythological figures known 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:37.810
 which seems destined to never be 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:39.700
 to forget culture is above all a 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:41.080
 dialogue between man and humanity at 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:43.330
 through the ages beyond time and 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.340
 space and its classic figures these 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.200
 myths are so many landmarks 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.930
 unalterable and fruitful that make this 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:51.669
 dialogue possible but let's get out of the 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:53.020
 mythology to go back to history to 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:53.950
 fine arts and let's look at 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.840
 Assassin's Creed 

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:57.520
 some play because dio el tahir 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.200
 or connors fart the class what is 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.640
 undeniable but others will be 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.410
 especially delighted to see a dizzying 

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.430
 dive into some of the places and 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:06.130
 some of the most 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:09.130
 stunning that is jerusalem venice 

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:11.080
 florence of renaissance facebook in 

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:12.400
 some destroyed and if some young people at 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.110
 final will not know boston tea 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.940
 party that what assassin's creed iii 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.110
 the euro has discovered at least not 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.330
 will not they be quite 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:20.979
 foreign culture is not there to 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.419
 twisting the best is the mythology 

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:24.190
 you see what it is mythology 

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:27.430
 beating but and hop it's culture 

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:29.229
 good your diesbach hero we demonstrate it's 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:31.360
 violent level culture it may not be 

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:33.160
 well up but a cycle that happen they 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.680
 cyclops for the madness pipe burst the eye 

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:37.510
 as ulysses against polyphemus and there it is 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:39.190
 is it's the odyssey it's the 

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:42.190
 grants it's heritage 

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:44.740
 the cocktail with aurélie filippetti 

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:46.630
 magic no this dear louis 1000 does not have 

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:47.890
 quite wrong brassens himself does not 

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:49.840
 did not take any other 

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:52.090
 status of singer mustard mustache to 

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.919
 the one from pau is son of ronsard and 

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:55.539
 heir to verlaine but let's stop there 

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:57.340
 this is quibbling abstruse and let us leave 

00:06:55.539 --> 00:06:59.979
 clear thought of edgar morin illuminated 

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:04.020
 this Sunday bite culture this is it 

00:06:59.979 --> 00:07:04.020
 which connects knowledge and fertility 

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.720
 so you see basically it's simple 

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:09.100
 make one or two references to the 

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.240
 mythology and poof 

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:13.870
 that is to say culture 

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:15.520
 ok you will have to follow the maze and 

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:18.759
 his light like the son of Dorothea 

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:20.740
 of ariane barari has nothing nothing given 

00:07:18.759 --> 00:07:22.479
 and so with dolphin school you 

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:25.270
 plunge into the abyss and east of 

00:07:22.479 --> 00:07:29.139
 the Ocean sakhri territory of Poseidon and 

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:31.509
 what is it? 

00:07:29.139 --> 00:07:33.729
 and as a Trojan Helen pursued by 

00:07:31.509 --> 00:07:35.650
 the diabolical menelaus in China on 

00:07:33.729 --> 00:07:37.990
 victorious and hector the brave this 

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:39.940
 dance fight that does not mean anything 

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:41.110
 does not mean anything and if these standards have 

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:43.000
 a killer makes sense to these cultures 

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:44.229
 so listen patrick sébastien he was 

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.289
 very well the wall there was not talking about 

00:07:44.229 --> 00:07:50.889
 greek did in fact it was really 

00:07:47.289 --> 00:07:56.639
 well I found was something to 

00:07:50.889 --> 00:07:56.639
 china but dallas pegasus shiryu
