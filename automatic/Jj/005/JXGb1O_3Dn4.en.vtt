favorite weapons I've experienced so far
in<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.890> game<00:00:35.010> I<00:00:36.000> powered<00:00:36.630> through<00:00:36.660> using<00:00:37.230> it

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
in the game I powered through using it

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.060 
in the game I powered through using it
and<00:00:38.450> really<00:00:39.450> got<00:00:39.600> what<00:00:40.140> I<00:00:40.200> think<00:00:40.500> is<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.649> fairly

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
and really got what I think is a fairly

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.000 
and really got what I think is a fairly
good<00:00:41.280> analysis<00:00:41.730> of<00:00:41.879> this<00:00:42.000> gun<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:43.230> yes<00:00:43.860> to

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
good analysis of this gun and yes to

good analysis of this gun and yes to
answer<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.370> opening<00:00:44.820> question<00:00:45.149> I<00:00:45.270> do<00:00:45.329> think

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
answer the opening question I do think

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.790 
answer the opening question I do think
it<00:00:45.870> is<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.430> long-range<00:00:47.430> only<00:00:47.820> let<00:00:48.030> them<00:00:48.800> can

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
it is and long-range only let them can

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.410 
it is and long-range only let them can
you<00:00:49.980> round<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.370> corner<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.820> kill<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.090> guy<00:00:51.270> up

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
you round a corner and kill a guy up

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.750 
you round a corner and kill a guy up
close<00:00:51.660> with<00:00:51.840> it<00:00:52.020> yes<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.440> can<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:53.160> cyclic

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
close with it yes you can the cyclic

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.939 
close with it yes you can the cyclic
rate<00:00:53.969> of<00:00:54.210> this<00:00:54.329> weapon<00:00:54.719> is<00:00:54.840> low<00:00:55.140> though<00:00:55.410> what

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
rate of this weapon is low though what

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.119 
rate of this weapon is low though what
that<00:00:56.070> means<00:00:56.219> is<00:00:56.399> you're<00:00:56.430> not<00:00:56.940> able<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:58.129> pull

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
that means is you're not able to pull

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.580 
that means is you're not able to pull
the<00:00:59.309> trigger<00:00:59.340> as<00:01:00.000> quick<00:01:00.780> as<00:01:00.930> you<00:01:01.050> can<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.469> have

don't know if it was just me or if
that's<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.329> way<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.600> gun<00:01:57.780> was<00:01:57.960> designed<00:01:58.320> but

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
that's the way the gun was designed but

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.880 
that's the way the gun was designed but
it<00:01:59.640> decent<00:02:00.240> range<00:02:00.570> looking<00:02:01.380> through<00:02:01.740> the

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
it decent range looking through the

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.550 
it decent range looking through the
sights<00:02:02.159> it<00:02:02.579> would<00:02:03.390> kill<00:02:03.420> guys<00:02:03.930> pretty<00:02:04.259> quick

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
sights it would kill guys pretty quick

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.770 
sights it would kill guys pretty quick
oftentimes<00:02:05.250> in<00:02:05.640> one<00:02:05.850> burst<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.570> was<00:02:06.659> like

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
oftentimes in one burst and it was like

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.510 
oftentimes in one burst and it was like
wow<00:02:06.930> this<00:02:07.170> thing<00:02:07.350> is

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
wow this thing is

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.790 
wow this thing is
powerful<00:02:07.939> but<00:02:08.690> if<00:02:08.810> I<00:02:08.899> rounded<00:02:09.289> the<00:02:09.349> corner<00:02:09.709> and

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
powerful but if I rounded the corner and

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.830 
powerful but if I rounded the corner and
someone<00:02:10.099> was<00:02:10.250> up<00:02:10.369> close<00:02:10.610> with<00:02:10.759> me<00:02:10.970> and<00:02:11.540> I<00:02:11.599> put<00:02:11.810> a

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
someone was up close with me and I put a

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.540 
someone was up close with me and I put a
burst<00:02:12.080> into<00:02:12.379> him<00:02:12.500> up<00:02:12.590> close<00:02:12.769> it<00:02:13.190> would<00:02:13.310> almost

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
burst into him up close it would almost

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.119 
burst into him up close it would almost
always<00:02:13.970> take<00:02:14.810> a<00:02:14.840> minimum<00:02:15.260> of<00:02:15.470> two<00:02:15.709> bursts

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:16.129 
always take a minimum of two bursts

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:19.240 
always take a minimum of two bursts

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
face in the heart of the action no pass

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:57.539

this<00:02:55.730> gun<00:02:55.940> up<00:02:56.090> move<00:02:56.390> on<00:02:56.599> use<00:02:56.989> something<00:02:57.319> else

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
this gun up move on use something else

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:00.280 
this gun up move on use something else
or<00:02:58.549> you<00:02:58.790> will<00:02:58.940> just<00:02:59.180> spend<00:02:59.420> your<00:02:59.540> time<00:02:59.720> getting

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:03.829 
really frustrated like I did so I do

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:07.000 
really frustrated like I did so I do
think<00:03:04.069> it's<00:03:04.250> a<00:03:04.310> long-range<00:03:04.610> only<00:03:04.910> weapon<00:03:06.010> take

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
think it's a long-range only weapon take

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.309 
think it's a long-range only weapon take
that<00:03:07.160> in<00:03:07.250> consideration<00:03:07.280> and<00:03:08.090> if<00:03:08.840> you<00:03:09.019> feel

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319 
that in consideration and if you feel

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:10.509 
that in consideration and if you feel
