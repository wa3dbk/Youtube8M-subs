00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
today it was actually gone and

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.420 
today it was actually gone and
apparently<00:00:36.090> Rockstar<00:00:36.860> actually<00:00:37.860> did<00:00:38.070> remove

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
apparently Rockstar actually did remove

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.360 
apparently Rockstar actually did remove
it<00:00:38.610> purposely<00:00:39.090> it<00:00:39.329> was<00:00:39.450> only<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.980> singular<00:00:40.980> day

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
it purposely it was only a singular day

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.760 
it purposely it was only a singular day
kind<00:00:42.210> of<00:00:42.300> special<00:00:42.690> holiday<00:00:43.020> event<00:00:43.379> which<00:00:43.559> she

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
kind of special holiday event which she

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.170 
kind of special holiday event which she
which<00:00:43.920> didn't<00:00:44.250> really<00:00:44.309> make<00:00:44.579> sense<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.940> me<00:00:45.030> it

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
which didn't really make sense to me it

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.700 
which didn't really make sense to me it
looks<00:00:45.390> like<00:00:45.450> they<00:00:45.660> put<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:45.899> lot<00:00:46.170> of<00:00:46.320> work<00:00:46.469> into

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
looks like they put a lot of work into

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.350 
looks like they put a lot of work into
it<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:46.980> I<00:00:47.340> didn't<00:00:47.610> really<00:00:47.700> get<00:00:47.940> why<00:00:48.090> they<00:00:48.239> was

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
it and I didn't really get why they was

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.479 
it and I didn't really get why they was
taken<00:00:48.570> away<00:00:48.660> but<00:00:49.320> another<00:00:49.649> thing<00:00:50.100> that<00:00:50.160> I

it unfortunately there is a snow cheap
for<00:01:36.990> story<00:01:37.290> mode<00:01:37.560> but<00:01:38.100> it<00:01:38.220> doesn't<00:01:38.759> pile<00:01:39.299> up

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
for story mode but it doesn't pile up

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.530 
for story mode but it doesn't pile up
the<00:01:39.509> snow<00:01:39.900> on<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.710> ground<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:42.060> on

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
the snow on the ground and and on

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.999 
the snow on the ground and and on
objects<00:01:43.049> like<00:01:43.140> how<00:01:43.290> it<00:01:43.439> did<00:01:43.649> when<00:01:43.860> they

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
objects like how it did when they

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.980 
objects like how it did when they
actually<00:01:44.700> made<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:44.970> snow<00:01:45.210> online<00:01:45.570> so<00:01:45.780> that's

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
actually made it snow online so that's

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.870 
actually made it snow online so that's
kind<00:01:46.619> of<00:01:46.680> disappointing<00:01:46.860> I<00:01:47.340> really<00:01:47.579> wish<00:01:47.729> that

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
kind of disappointing I really wish that

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.550 
kind of disappointing I really wish that
they<00:01:48.030> would<00:01:48.149> make<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.390> cheat<00:01:48.869> at<00:01:49.020> least<00:01:49.320> for

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
they would make a cheat at least for

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.950 
they would make a cheat at least for
story<00:01:49.799> mode<00:01:50.009> so<00:01:50.189> that<00:01:50.310> we<00:01:50.399> can<00:01:50.549> always

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
story mode so that we can always

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.690 
story mode so that we can always
experience<00:01:51.960> this<00:01:52.290> kind<00:01:52.590> of<00:01:52.829> snow<00:01:53.100> fall<00:01:53.310> effect

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
experience this kind of snow fall effect

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.030 
experience this kind of snow fall effect
and<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.960> then<00:01:55.259> yeah<00:01:55.409> so<00:01:55.439> what<00:01:55.770> did<00:01:55.860> you<00:01:55.950> guys

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
and and then yeah so what did you guys

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.440 
and and then yeah so what did you guys
think<00:01:56.100> of<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:56.399> I<00:01:56.490> noticed<00:01:56.880> that<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.119> cars<00:01:57.360> were

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
think of it I noticed that the cars were

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.600 
think of it I noticed that the cars were
really<00:01:58.049> slippery<00:01:58.530> when<00:01:58.920> driving<00:01:59.369> with<00:01:59.490> them

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
really slippery when driving with them

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.730 
really slippery when driving with them
in<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.850> snow<00:01:59.909> which<00:02:00.840> is<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:01.110> be<00:02:01.200> expected<00:02:01.500> of

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
in the snow which is to be expected of

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.889 
in the snow which is to be expected of
course<00:02:01.979> if<00:02:02.189> you<00:02:02.310> guys<00:02:02.460> have<00:02:03.149> ever<00:02:03.360> driven<00:02:03.719> in

course if you guys have ever driven in
snow<00:02:04.110> in<00:02:04.409> real<00:02:04.590> life<00:02:04.829> I<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:05.460> know<00:02:05.759> it's<00:02:05.909> not

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
snow in real life I you know it's not

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.719 
snow in real life I you know it's not
the<00:02:06.420> optimal<00:02:07.020> driving<00:02:07.799> conditions<00:02:08.429> but

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
the optimal driving conditions but

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.639 
the optimal driving conditions but
