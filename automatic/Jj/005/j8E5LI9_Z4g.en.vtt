00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
because I didn't put in my braids fully

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.790

into<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.400> hot<00:02:32.640> water<00:02:33.150> and<00:02:33.570> if<00:02:34.470> you<00:02:34.590> remember

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
into the hot water and if you remember

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.820 
into the hot water and if you remember
is<00:02:35.430> because<00:02:35.790> I<00:02:36.270> do<00:02:36.330> on<00:02:36.570> my<00:02:36.600> braids<00:02:37.140> curling<00:02:37.680> yet

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
is because I do on my braids curling yet

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.210 
is because I do on my braids curling yet
so<00:02:38.520> that's<00:02:39.000> why
