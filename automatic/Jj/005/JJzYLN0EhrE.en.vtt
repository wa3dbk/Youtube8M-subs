00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 Hello, how about a good day? 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.410
 today we are going to talk about what they are 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:12.019
 the battery chargers everything 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.019
 you need to know what you know to load 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.210
 to me 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.300
 let's talk about the batteries more 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:35.629
 basic that are used in the mobile 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:38.350
 these are those of the possible lithium type 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:38.350
 michele metal 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.730
 the type batteries are much more 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:46.010
 delicate than those of mid in mind when 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.500
 trailer because because when the 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.050
 hiccups are overloaded when they reach 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:54.530
 Basso decades was a voltage 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:57.079
 which is calculated as three points seven 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:01.129
 dead each cell they begin to lose their 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:04.010
 life they start to inflate watch every 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:06.080
 the least time rogue batteries can 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.090
 get to last more than age 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.570
 both powers during the whole journey 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.759
 is the battery of the full charge this 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.930
 res gravel to the three points of volts 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:19.970
 in those of mystery these highgate in 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.920
 those islands completely discharges 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.080
 portions losing a part of that 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.560
 power that also gives you to 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.179
 principle it is important to know that 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.000
 lithium batteries should not be 

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:34.250
 riding in warm enclosed places 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.560
 for example of cars a lot of people 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.229
 Consider leaving your battery in the car and 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.600
 what this does is damage the 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.940
 bullet that 'no and you may intrigue it in 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.160
 laundry lots among you several 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.410
 videos on youtube of the batteries 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.360
 exploiting the lithium ones are very 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.860
 fun but nevertheless we do not want 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.830
 what happens to us 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.140
 you have to be very careful the batteries 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.360
 you do not have to load the others either 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.510
 of lithium if they are overloaded too 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.780
 they pass the same thing then what is recommended 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.490
 is to use the proper charger to charge 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.740
 the rules long enough and 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.690
 will be pending with time put 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.690
 on a surface where there can not be 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.240
 something close that can 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.610
 grab fires in case of crisis 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.650
 the battery is very rare to happen 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.720
 it is clear however you have to have the 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.880
 awareness that they are batteries that 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.450
 we have to be taking care to 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.490
 transport the batteries to the track or 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.370
 return what is normally recommended 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.560
 is to use a cooler the free passes 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.950
 less heat from outside to inside is 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.440
 they retain more in their temperature and can 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.330
 last longer batteries now and the 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.360
 Most radios bring what they are 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:50.000
 pods to tell you when it's already 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.830
 it's over the battery these two the 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.790
 programs depending on the plane you're going 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.890
 saying 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.990
 with this stuff that will last 12 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.240
 minutes the plane in flight the cart not 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.190
 You are going to try to see how much 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.680
 the first battery lasts 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:07.160
 good of usual to check the battery 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.020
 every 23 minutes once it's already mole 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.630
 five minutes you are checking each 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.400
 minute 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.770
 to see what lap he has left and he knows 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.440
 long can the battery after me 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:20.170
 of several tests I get an average of 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.270
 time that I improve and that they eat and 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.730
 tagra if you do not have a degree of that 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.530
 time you can use your cell phone to put a 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.660
 stopwatch or someone else tell you 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.220
 how long have you been flying this is 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.660
 important so that they do not get downloaded 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.850
 other batteries 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.260
 There are different types of chargers that 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.930
 you can use depending on the 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.700
 battery that you are using there are chargers 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.860
 which are specifically for nickel 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.420
 metal haider and nickel carling which are 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.820
 the most common subjects for 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:50.110
 roads of the control that the three of 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:52.150
 those of bullets monster trucks 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.980
 all trusted changes between 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.860
 nougat usually bring batteries 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:59.350
 'put mental these chargers are 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:02.020
 relatively inexpensive and they help you 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:04.210
 that instead of the load that normally 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:09.420
 during a charger that is included from 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:09.420
 about 67 hours in about 23 hours 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:15.520
 It is also important to see in it 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:18.250
 battery that will say the highest level 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:21.459
 of loading a 12 to a maximum level of 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:23.620
 load 12 maximum load level 13 each 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.090
 one of those is how much you can 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.640
 load normally on machines the 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.440
 batteries giving a series of charge that 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.600
 which means that the maximum the amperage 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.880
 that the battery says the charges of that 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.340
 amperage down if it's 12 what 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.340
 you can charge double if we have this 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:42.070
 3200 battery you can not charge up 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:44.710
 6.4 to perez if out of 12 is 17 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:47.320
 meat we also have what it is 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.450
 chargers that do nothing but work 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.370
 for the unit more for mentally 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:53.560
 but chargers that work for you 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:57.100
 all kinds of batteries on the internet to 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:59.110
 level garmin and felipe lead 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.060
 everything I have You can use 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.970
 here you can load it with two chargers 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:07.160
 there are chargers that range from presenting 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.870
 more or less adequate 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.340
 you can use the ones to load 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.230
 new batteries 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:14.600
 these chargers are programmable they have 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:17.720
 memory also in case you want 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:21.080
 charge your 3200 battery you put the 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:23.810
 battery memory villada and you're going to 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.889
 see how to load is important in charge 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:28.289
 already programmable like this 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:30.449
 you know how it is that you have to carry the 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:31.949
 battery here you have to program it by 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:33.629
 example if this is a lithium battery 

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:36.749
 you have to try a different program 

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:41.189
 Charges the maximum lithium battery type 

00:05:36.749 --> 00:05:43.289
 3.2 before and it gave to load in a 

00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:44.909
 digital metal cairo of programs ni te 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:48.330
 street goals of 20 the exchange rate that 

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:50.009
 you want and you get up to load 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.830
 It is also important for shippers 

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:54.810
 of video and program you have to 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.909
 connect the two big ones that come from 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:59.159
 the battery one is to charge the battery 

00:05:56.909 --> 00:06:01.199
 and the other is to balance each 

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:03.449
 one of the cells they have in the 

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:05.580
 mikel mental nothing more than a combi 

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:08.099
 cable that thinks connect and with it you 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:10.379
 will load the whole vagina that has been 

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:12.090
 everything for today please have a lot 

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:14.340
 consider what we have just told you 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:16.169
 only download the battery 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:19.009
 lithium never channel plus area of 

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:21.619
 in charge throughout the night 

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:24.439
 You can endanger anything more 

00:06:21.619 --> 00:06:26.330
 battery if not the plane your house wherever 

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:28.729
 that are charging the battery is very 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:30.919
 important is and I hope you have 

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:33.169
 much liked any comment the 

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:36.819
 Comment that you have please write 

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:36.819
 what here do not forget
