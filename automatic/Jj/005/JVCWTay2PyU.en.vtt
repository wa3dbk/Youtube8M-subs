oh yeah one thing I should add is these
are<00:06:58.490> 70<00:06:58.940> millimeter<00:06:59.420> wheels<00:06:59.720> so<00:07:00.560> I<00:07:00.830> think

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:01.550 
are 70 millimeter wheels so I think

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:02.950 
are 70 millimeter wheels so I think
they're<00:07:01.670> definitely<00:07:01.880> designed<00:07:02.360> for<00:07:02.510> a<00:07:02.570> longer

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:02.960 
they're definitely designed for a longer

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.600 
they're definitely designed for a longer
board<00:07:03.200> I<00:07:03.470> mean<00:07:03.620> this<00:07:03.770> isn't<00:07:04.100> even<00:07:04.190> that<00:07:04.310> long

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:04.610 
board I mean this isn't even that long

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:07.900 
board I mean this isn't even that long
this<00:07:04.880> board<00:07:05.530> um<00:07:06.560> compared<00:07:07.190> to<00:07:07.250> a<00:07:07.340> penny<00:07:07.610> board

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:07.910 
this board um compared to a penny board

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:12.040 
this board um compared to a penny board
I<00:07:08.030> guess<00:07:08.090> it's<00:07:10.180> it's<00:07:11.180> really<00:07:11.390> not<00:07:11.570> that<00:07:11.630> long

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:12.050 
I guess it's it's really not that long

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:13.600 
I guess it's it's really not that long
