 llosa angry he had already killed sights 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.680
 I had already put it on his body but 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.380

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.880

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:03.300

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.540
 wanting to go up a bit of variety like that 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.040
 what good if you want to keep seeing 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.350
 variety in the channel I said in his me 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.460
 you like it and so if there are several I like it 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.080
 I'm still uploading some games 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.880
 different to bring a little bit of 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.700
 different content and how to guide it 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.430
 when he pointed I do not know what's going on with that 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.470
 there it is here that aim what aim 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.270
 today you are not so good I have seen 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.770
 better players than you do not but it's that 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.600
 I 'm not saying it's the best single 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.189
 I'm giving you good no no no you're not 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.710
 saying that you are the best you are 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:41.869
 insinuating that guy was good not like 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.490
 that out of bounds although I 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.580
 they killed normal I thought I had been 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.580
 dead with that from out of bounds 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:51.850
 this map is like now I see that they were flying 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:54.490
 Arab signs everywhere 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.290
 are at the bottom of the map and there are several 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.630
 snai people there are several types of sniper 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.659
 Here's one 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.380
 or double where there is another stop coming 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:06.380
 whores 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.789
 here there must be someone not this seems 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.440
 like a shotgun but although not what 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:11.930
 create is a single sniper that does not have the 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.640
 Look at the sniper la chévere is looking 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.260
 as for clouds but good I am 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.390
 using mostly because I also 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.160
 like it a little is very long bad 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.190
 distance but in close you have a lot 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.980
 advantage and iii and iv double double double 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.630
 triple no water and there 's the triple me 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:31.540
 will see well cool and hype point 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:33.920
 new number fell not mark you know you 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.110
 This event, as I was telling you, is pure 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.670
 night but the experience is being given 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.830
 to use the sniper is very cool 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.780
 lately to the state playing a lot like that 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.480
 that I have improved my skills enough 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.880
 sniper as clear that then you find yourself 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.739
 some tracks that are a cock this is not 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.380
 they are so good apparently but there are some 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:53.390
 that are not good very good use just 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.459
 two you saw and album killed you and all I 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.930
 quiet old calm I travel alone 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.900
 you in a gameplay them taka taka 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:04.420
 taka they kill you they kill you it's hard and 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:06.670
 what aim that aim 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.709
 we are winning by 15 we have a lot 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.780
 advantage let's hope and the advantage is 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:13.450
 keep must be down here and 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.730
 where, where I did not see it, I did not see it 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.170
 is the problem of the call of duty of 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.390
 these games that is what to me the most 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:22.180
 frustrates sometimes is that they kill you sometimes 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.680
 because you do not see them wey do not kill him in 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.340
 serious I did not kill him I'm not killing him I'm going 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.260
 to leave I'm going to leave I was stunned 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.360
 stunned dies son of the cock I 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.000
 also hit him that's the hit is 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:37.090
 super badly done and my aim is 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.850
 Failing and aim is failing and goes up 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:43.239
 It goes up It goes up It is bad because it does not go up 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:45.100
 because it does not go up and when it goes up they kill me 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:47.290
 it matters 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.600
 I do not know I'm not so bad but I'm not going either 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:53.920
 also with what is left is positive 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:59.040
 I'm glad and your mother's son killed me dani 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:59.040
 but xxxx danny prop 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.390
 where there is someone where there is someone 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:07.190
 I'm out here the smell of shit 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.190
 look from chair to shit 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:15.520
 there is another one where they are behind 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:17.650
 is behind is back just tomás not what 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:21.579
 I killed myself but good anyway 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:23.830
 I would have killed I think that aim 1 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:25.419
 I did not give him and I did not give him 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.580
 I had given 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:28.780
 there is up there not from my team there 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.759
 is all my team I'm going to mention a 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.289
 granada to see if it helps them like that of 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:35.899
 suddenly it's the make the game 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:37.580
 What a nice shot I love is to clean 

00:04:35.899 --> 00:04:39.770
 in all the games it 's like something 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.930
 Amazing and fun in any game 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:43.339
 where you are fun until the 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.539
 games that are badly made 

00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:46.539
 snyder is fun 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:52.420
 They should not be here, so let's go 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.010
 to let my team go in front of me 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:56.800
 I like to let my team die and 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:58.450
 then I go so here we go 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.330
 come on let's help my team there's no 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:04.720
 no one should be below 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:06.010
 we have not won victory game no no 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.020
 I played as well as I would have liked 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:10.060
 but well up here I'm going to leave this 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.100
 mini gameplay of or I do not know if it was minion or 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.960
 If you want to continue watching games with 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:16.060
 the sniper in call of duty advanced the 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.950
 which fer leaves your like and so I can 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:20.740
 keep going up games other games 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:23.430
 things of the non-pure style jeta 5 up 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.430
 then goodbye 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:35.190
 in this case 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.520
 it does not happen to me
