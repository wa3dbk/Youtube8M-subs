00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
probably just put glass up right here

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.870 
probably just put glass up right here
and<00:01:59.640> you<00:01:59.670> could<00:02:00.299> have<00:02:00.450> spiders<00:02:01.170> as<00:02:01.350> your<00:02:01.530> pets

possibly maybe cover up
top<00:02:03.860> right<00:02:04.100> there<00:02:04.310> so<00:02:04.490> they<00:02:04.580> spawn<00:02:04.880> in<00:02:05.060> but

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
top right there so they spawn in but

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:08.529
