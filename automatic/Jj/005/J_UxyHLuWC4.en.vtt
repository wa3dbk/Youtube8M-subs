is the low spot of the railroad and

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.189 
is the low spot of the railroad and
build<00:00:20.550> it<00:00:20.730> up<00:00:20.850> from<00:00:21.060> there<00:00:21.270> and<00:00:21.330> used<00:00:21.810> as<00:00:21.990> much

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
then we put plastic sheeting over to

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.560 
then we put plastic sheeting over to
heavy<00:01:12.119> gauge<00:01:12.900> plastic<00:01:13.619> like<00:01:14.549> for<00:01:14.790> pond<00:01:15.000> liners

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
heavy gauge plastic like for pond liners

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.260 
heavy gauge plastic like for pond liners
and<00:01:16.460> covered<00:01:17.460> it<00:01:17.580> with<00:01:17.610> dirt<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:18.090> made<00:01:18.240> a

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
and covered it with dirt and made a

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.679 
and covered it with dirt and made a
mountain<00:01:18.659> put<00:01:19.259> in<00:01:19.409> rocks<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:20.119> all<00:01:21.119> that<00:01:21.450> kind

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
mountain put in rocks and all that kind

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.120 
mountain put in rocks and all that kind
of<00:01:21.720> stuff<00:01:21.840> we<00:01:22.020> have<00:01:22.110> lots<00:01:22.380> of<00:01:22.560> rocks<00:01:22.799> here

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
of stuff we have lots of rocks here

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.910 
of stuff we have lots of rocks here
didn't<00:01:23.700> have<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:23.970> buy<00:01:24.150> rocks<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.780> fill<00:01:25.560> up<00:01:25.710> the

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
didn't have to buy rocks to fill up the

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.990 
didn't have to buy rocks to fill up the
yard<00:01:26.729> with<00:01:26.880> rocks

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
yard with rocks

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.300 
yard with rocks
now<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.060> pond<00:01:30.390> is<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:32.060> prebuilt<00:01:33.060> one<00:01:33.420> of<00:01:33.570> those

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
now the pond is a prebuilt one of those

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:40.640 
now the pond is a prebuilt one of those
freeform<00:01:35.310> or<00:01:36.170> plastic<00:01:37.170> ponds<00:01:39.079> yeah<00:01:40.079> it's<00:01:40.470> a

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
freeform or plastic ponds yeah it's a

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.960 
freeform or plastic ponds yeah it's a
dark<00:01:40.950> I<00:01:41.880> guess<00:01:42.659> it's<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:42.899> dark<00:01:43.200> grey<00:01:43.500> and

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
dark I guess it's a dark grey and

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.639 
dark I guess it's a dark grey and
they're<00:01:44.970> typical<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.600> little<00:01:45.840> garden<00:01:46.170> ponds

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
they're typical to little garden ponds

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.510 
they're typical to little garden ponds
they're<00:01:46.829> too<00:01:47.040> shallow<00:01:47.430> for<00:01:48.020> fish<00:01:49.399> because<00:01:50.399> in

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
they're too shallow for fish because in

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.100 
they're too shallow for fish because in
the<00:01:50.610> summertime<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.299> water<00:01:51.540> would<00:01:51.720> get<00:01:51.869> too

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
the summertime the water would get too

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.080 
the summertime the water would get too
hot<00:01:52.409> and<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.860> winter<00:01:53.100> time<00:01:53.310> is<00:01:53.520> not<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:53.700> problem

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
hot and the winter time is not a problem

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.990 
hot and the winter time is not a problem
you<00:01:54.450> could<00:01:54.570> put<00:01:54.810> in<00:01:54.960> fish<00:01:55.290> now<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:55.979> they<00:01:56.880> would

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
you could put in fish now and they would

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.899 
you could put in fish now and they would
survive<00:01:57.360> over<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.899> winter<00:01:58.200> quite<00:01:58.500> well<00:01:58.909> but

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
survive over the winter quite well but

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.050 
survive over the winter quite well but
unless<00:02:00.149> it's<00:02:00.390> shaded<00:02:00.930> you<00:02:01.799> need<00:02:02.009> about<00:02:02.159> a

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
unless it's shaded you need about a

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.120 
unless it's shaded you need about a
minimum<00:02:03.780> of<00:02:03.930> two<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.259> half<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.649> three<00:02:04.680> foot

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
minimum of two and a half to three foot

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.760 
minimum of two and a half to three foot
depth<00:02:05.520> at<00:02:05.729> some<00:02:05.969> point<00:02:06.240> to<00:02:06.479> keep<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.560> water

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
depth at some point to keep the water

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:15.160 
depth at some point to keep the water
cold

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170
