 they take their technique tantito the protons 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.749
 of temperature no longer left is very 

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:50.120
 important to choose dad 

00:00:47.749 --> 00:00:52.339
 ok then we listen with a lot 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.729
 clear attention if for objects 

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:59.629
 again we will occupy 500 grams of 

00:00:55.729 --> 00:01:03.819
 our powdered 500 grams of walnut in 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.819
 powder or finely chopped 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:11.440
 if we will also need to need 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:15.730
 750 grams of standard sugar or 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:20.350
 Withdrawed 750 grams of standard sugar 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:24.850
 or refined skin 500 milliliters of 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:26.680
 milk 500 milliliters of milk out there in 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.230
 our room in the face 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.600
 you are going to see some error that says 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:34.030
 500 liters is milliliters please 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.500
 correct is a 500 finger error 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.390
 milliliters of milk or what is the same 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:43.000
 half liter 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:47.130
 here the 80 grams of yolk 80 grams of 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.130
 dissolved egg yolk 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:55.030
 80 grams of dissolved buds on average 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:58.520
 cup in a room in a cup room 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.100
 currently in a perfect you can 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.420
 tell our listeners 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.369
 approximately the weight of a yolk to 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.039
 if you do not have scales more or less 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:10.250
 Orient clear that they should around 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:15.650
 20 grams would offer 4 star village of 4 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:17.390
 budgets of each web belonging to the 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.750
 first we 're going to put it the same 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.930
 extra milk with sugar 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.840
 already when they are boiling add the yolk 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.599
 previously dissolved in cold milk 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.360
 we align continuously to very low fire 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:34.090
 important at low heat until it arrives 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:37.569
 at a temperature of 110 degrees low is 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.430
 when you have the point of napa true 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.650
 that when we are the teaspoon with the 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.780
 mix with the finger that already the 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.760
 line does not drain for glasses in this 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.459
 moment and is ready is very important 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.110
 that we continue to this point will take 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.030
 a little bit in the eighties is going to 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.560
 take a little but it was going to reach 200 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.989
 pounds 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.640
 the most important part yes because if not 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:59.799
 We will coagulate Truly 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.280
 snatch the fire is going to coagulate and 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:05.049
 are going to make pieces of cooked yolk 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:08.170
 exactly and afterwards we add our 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:10.760
 ground walnut we turn them very very very 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.430
 well we remove from the fire 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.439
 and then pour into a mold 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.450
 silicone or if we do not have mold of 

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:19.959
 silicone we can produce any 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:23.629
 mold without bottom previously greased 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:27.019
 we perceive that small pieces are the 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:28.850
 We waited around 45 minutes to 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:31.280
 that solidifies 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.260
 big party let's wait for so 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.600
 less about two hours to solidify 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.220
 our product and subsequently what 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.020
 we can cut in case we do 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:42.710
 in a mold 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:45.140
 but as perfect now if we have 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:47.810
 these molds milestones to make chocolates 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:50.390
 to make chocolates and so on 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.190
 we want to empty it you can go where 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.650
 silicon fit although man 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:57.080
 Polycarbonate is not possible not reached 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.330
 detach if the silicone mold with 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:02.270
 different shapes can easily be 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.800
 make perfectible and delicious and also 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:05.280
 they are perfect as gifts for 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.930
 Christmas 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.200
 that were really chose fedesarrollo 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.880
 Monterrey test elaborates a lot 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.880
 precisely because it is very close to 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:17.040
 nogales coahuila then the very cheap 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.530
 and caranavi to prepare these delicious 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.959
 desserts and you really get religion 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:26.370
 They have to be like a type of glory with no 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:28.530
 is that we have a guy like ham you 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.240
 I was going to say yes as ham but now 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.980
 you see that for example, they sell 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.290
 glories thing that here for example this 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.930
 so traditional sweet from the north of 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:40.020
 our country they sell it for example with 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:42.210
 nuts with dates with walnuts and the 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.950
 Pure pure natural from the pure pool 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.800
 milk with sugar then our 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.660
 friends can play also to put a 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.970
 little date or even plum 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.410
 not to do not make it so expensive with 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.240
 the nut for example that then usually 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.550
 happen to be very expensive at this time 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.990
 when they have it ready like you we 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.880
 is indicating is already does not yield a 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.560
 little bit more and it's going to be good

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.950
 spend one 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.290
 if we want to save a little we can 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:08.940
 replace the nut with peanuts 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:10.380
 example do it nissan and half for 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:13.020
 lower a bit the legal cost that of 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:15.630
