00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:26.420
 It's down there by the current 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:42.059

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.719

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:56.850
 Beauty and the last cross that I will make 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:02:00.030
 here it is harder to make a format well 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:04.939
 cool, it 's not a bug, it's nothing, it 's just a 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.939
 which is the following 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:18.970
 They have to do this, come back here. 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:22.900

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.160
 We're going to make 3 10 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:33.790
 and here it is 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:40.390
 you have to see that it gets 2 of the same color 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:47.760
 here and there you will start making a 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:47.760
 thing like that makes another line here 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:55.959
 Sorry, I do not even have to take it here. 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:57.220

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:02.470

 the same scheme is two opposite here 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:31.239

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:41.760
 there and she has to go there 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:41.760
 It's also the same as closing is a 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:55.049
 Behaving after the time, it 'll be fine. 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:56.880

00:03:55.049 --> 00:04:00.160
