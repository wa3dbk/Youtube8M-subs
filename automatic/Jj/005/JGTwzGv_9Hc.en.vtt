00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:51.650
 I do n't think I 'm going to win because of this game 

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:52.070
 but it also partly depends on my team 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.720

 and already exist ten points behind 11 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.190
 Points behind this can be a nice lake 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.320
 to rescue 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:24.650
 then I say one in one go 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:26.900
 giant streak bet but search for 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:29.650

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:46.280

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:48.949
 in fact sometime smart enemies 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:50.449
 monitor teaser vein 

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:54.139
 and I have to say it's tricky player 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:56.840
 with such a s12 if you have little call or duty 

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:59.060

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:02.240

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.419

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:16.160

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:17.690

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.050
