involves a piece of cards and a tube
down<00:01:10.890> which<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.460> meats<00:01:11.640> have<00:01:11.790> been<00:01:11.939> placed

down which the meats have been placed
they<00:01:12.900> will<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.590> card<00:01:13.860> will<00:01:14.100> then<00:01:14.220> be<00:01:14.369> removed

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
they will the card will then be removed

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.240 
they will the card will then be removed
and<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.659> mints<00:01:15.930> will<00:01:16.170> fall<00:01:16.470> into<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.920> bottle

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
and the mints will fall into the bottle

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.070 
and the mints will fall into the bottle
and<00:01:17.700> we<00:01:17.880> will<00:01:18.000> stand<00:01:18.180> back<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.630> observe<00:01:18.930> the

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
and we will stand back to observe the

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:25.180 
and we will stand back to observe the
results

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.190 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:40.090 

I<00:01:35.470> asked<00:01:36.470> to<00:01:36.560> make<00:01:36.680> three<00:01:36.950> inches<00:01:37.690> height<00:01:39.100> so

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
I asked to make three inches height so

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.310 
I asked to make three inches height so
is<00:01:40.280> a<00:01:40.310> science<00:01:40.730> behind<00:01:40.910> this<00:01:41.330> any<00:01:41.780> scientist

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
is a science behind this any scientist

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.500 
is a science behind this any scientist
can<00:01:42.470> make<00:01:42.620> they<00:01:42.830> explained<00:01:43.370> it<00:01:43.550> well<00:01:44.120> I<00:01:44.390> think

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.510 
can make they explained it well I think

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.170 
can make they explained it well I think
that<00:01:45.200> it's<00:01:45.410> a<00:01:45.650> physical<00:01:46.160> reaction<00:01:46.250> where<00:01:47.000> that

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
that it's a physical reaction where that

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.210 
that it's a physical reaction where that
there's<00:01:47.420> very<00:01:47.690> small<00:01:48.290> pits<00:01:48.560> within<00:01:48.920> the

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
there's very small pits within the

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.970 
there's very small pits within the
within<00:01:49.520> the<00:01:49.790> minty<00:01:50.150> mint<00:01:50.390> and<00:01:50.660> that<00:01:51.080> fills<00:01:51.800> up

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:51.980 
within the minty mint and that fills up

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.500 
within the minty mint and that fills up
with<00:01:52.010> carbonate<00:01:52.580> and<00:01:52.760> causes<00:01:53.120> it's<00:01:53.300> a<00:01:53.360> goes

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:53.510 
with carbonate and causes it's a goes

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.870 
with carbonate and causes it's a goes
whoosh<00:01:53.870> but<00:01:54.260> Durendal<00:01:54.950> exists<00:01:55.280> chemicals<00:01:55.700> I

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
whoosh but Durendal exists chemicals I

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.930 
whoosh but Durendal exists chemicals I
think<00:01:56.660> it's<00:01:56.780> a<00:01:56.840> chemical<00:01:57.020> reaction<00:01:57.320> between

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
think it's a chemical reaction between

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.940 
think it's a chemical reaction between
the<00:01:58.990> chemical<00:01:59.990> inner<00:02:00.200> man<00:02:00.350> toes<00:02:00.530> and<00:02:00.740> chem

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
clinic in the drink we also think it's

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.250 
clinic in the drink we also think it's
poetically<00:02:04.430> beautiful<00:02:05.000> and<00:02:05.480> it's<00:02:06.140> a

poetically beautiful and it's a

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.840 
poetically beautiful and it's a

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
philosophical and affection or fun

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.880 
philosophical and affection or fun
really<00:02:11.540> the<00:02:11.720> end<00:02:11.840> of<00:02:11.960> the<00:02:12.050> world<00:02:14.680> since<00:02:15.680> more

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
really the end of the world since more

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.210 
really the end of the world since more
they've<00:02:16.130> really<00:02:16.370> designed<00:02:16.700> at<00:02:17.480> all<00:02:17.950> it<00:02:18.950> ain't

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
they've really designed at all it ain't

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.560 
they've really designed at all it ain't
either<00:02:19.370> that's<00:02:19.910> what<00:02:20.090> I'm<00:02:20.180> that's<00:02:20.210> what<00:02:20.480> I'm

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
either that's what I'm that's what I'm

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:21.940 
either that's what I'm that's what I'm
saying<00:02:20.840> its<00:02:20.960> physical<00:02:21.290> is<00:02:21.500> that<00:02:21.680> it<00:02:21.740> doesn't

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
saying its physical is that it doesn't

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.910 
saying its physical is that it doesn't
actually<00:02:22.040> look<00:02:22.280> like<00:02:22.340> they've<00:02:22.580> lost<00:02:22.730> the<00:02:22.880> need

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
actually look like they've lost the need

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.530 
actually look like they've lost the need
so<00:02:24.920> we're<00:02:25.040> now<00:02:25.130> starting<00:02:25.370> the<00:02:25.760> second<00:02:26.270> stage

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
so we're now starting the second stage

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.600 
so we're now starting the second stage
of<00:02:26.570> the<00:02:26.870> experiments<00:02:27.590> which<00:02:27.800> involves<00:02:28.190> tesco

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
of the experiments which involves tesco

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.190 
of the experiments which involves tesco
diet<00:02:28.940> cola<00:02:29.270> and<00:02:30.280> extra<00:02:31.280> extra<00:02:31.820> strong<00:02:32.150> and<00:02:33.080> you

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
diet cola and extra extra strong and you

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.870 
diet cola and extra extra strong and you
can<00:02:33.320> see<00:02:33.500> the<00:02:33.680> delivery<00:02:33.980> mechanism<00:02:34.520> there<00:02:34.700> as

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
can see the delivery mechanism there as

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.470 
can see the delivery mechanism there as
well<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:36.500> cut<00:02:36.890> is<00:02:37.130> still<00:02:37.489> on<00:02:37.760> the<00:02:37.910> bottle<00:02:38.300> and

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
well the cut is still on the bottle and

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.830 
well the cut is still on the bottle and
the<00:02:38.540> reason<00:02:38.900> for<00:02:39.080> this<00:02:39.170> is<00:02:39.380> to<00:02:39.680> ensure<00:02:40.160> maximum

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
the reason for this is to ensure maximum

00:02:40.840 --> 00:03:02.500 
the reason for this is to ensure maximum
reactive<00:02:42.340> capacity

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.069 

probably<00:03:03.510> would<00:03:03.599> have<00:03:03.659> talking<00:03:03.959> with<00:03:04.049> a

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079 
probably would have talking with a

public higher get me today okay you
think<00:03:20.099> that's<00:03:20.250> good<00:03:20.430> that<00:03:20.579> we<00:03:20.670> need<00:03:20.849> to<00:03:20.879> go<00:03:21.030> to

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
think that's good that we need to go to

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:31.910 
think that's good that we need to go to
mental<00:03:29.090> I<00:03:30.090> reckon<00:03:31.079> just<00:03:31.200> meant<00:03:31.469> those<00:03:31.650> other
