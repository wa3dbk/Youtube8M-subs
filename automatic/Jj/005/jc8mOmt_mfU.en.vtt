 the staff watching malicious teachers go dot com 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:15.110
 These are welcome to the video training of file servers 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:18.109
 with 2800 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:27.390
 in this evolution of the course 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.369
 the guy talked a little about prerequisite structures 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:32.579
 and some topics that will be addressed 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.579
 come on 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.020
 what are the prerequisites pc course experience in windows support 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.560
 server 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.120
 2000 2003 to 2008 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.910
 experience microsoft's network support 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.750
 and knowledge of the abyss 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.220
 if you do not have 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.530
 a waste no problem 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.560
 along with the dvd 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:04.480
 of the course beer here you accompany all the classes of 2008 served the site 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.480
 or you can study directly on the website 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.540
 here on the 2008 video site you will find 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.080
 more than 28 lawns 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.120
 with an additional three hours 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.229
 today, since the installation of the system 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.920
 eight beer 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.280
 until the initial settings the concepts of adir 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.310
 the installation of the dermis 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.560
 the first steps as gracie workstations in the domain 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.690
 there is a lot of lice up and lose another course 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.620
 as crossed the area makes rosales on terminations then has a series of 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:47.720
 video classes 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.750
 which addressed all the necessary prerequisites 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.790
 for you to give sequence both in kuchi until one as in the contest of 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.790
 servers here 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.010
 study lover 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.590
 or you can study on real machine but if you are going to need a server 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:10.789
 2008 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.789
 and at least one workstation you windows xp service pack 3 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:18.210
 the then 7 windows vista 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.939
 here in the case the 8 ps has a single computer to possession of the remote sinoa 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:26.189
 can you ambiance ' 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:29.189
 I do not make them for you 

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:32.719
 so what I have in 2008 the center 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:34.550
 the endorser 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.990
 ProfÂª floor in windows xp sit pec 3 

00:02:38.669 --> 00:02:42.429
 all on a single computer if you want to know more about action victories 

00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:45.420
 also has video requested pc goal 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.910
 in a specific class can be hit two servers 2008 right in the other 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.099
 only one 2008 server to give the message 

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:08.629
 which neither your file server nor years will use the file server 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:10.190
 that an accountant 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.259
 the number 2008 serves 

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:15.869
 to provide a centralized point in the network for storage and 

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:17.599
 file sharing 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:21.680
 between users providing security and availability of the necessary data 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.179
 business 

00:03:24.179 --> 00:03:26.709
 what is this going to be installed in the function 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.159
 in the server 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:29.430
 and this function 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.660
 will create an environment and where all my network but saved the data of a single 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:34.799
 computer 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:38.319
 but with the advantage of this I can do the access control which the 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:40.919
 eyes may or may not access the server 

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:43.459
 but they can not only value 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.929
 any file the server assets 

00:03:46.929 --> 00:03:49.929
 in another environment and consistent this wall 

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:54.139
 as the resources we are going to implement 

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:58.689
 which users can or can not access a folder 

00:03:58.689 --> 00:03:59.949
 write in that part 

00:03:59.949 --> 00:04:04.809
 which users can erase the files enabling the permission holder throughout 

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:07.469
 in every environment 

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:10.540
 both at the level of sharing and the level of interference 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:15.609
 we are going to have a very interesting resource 2008 the Serbian doing 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:17.139
 part of 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:18.440
 fs 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.440
 mm with silencer of educational resources 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.340
 that sorting files what we need 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.889
 I can selected on the server 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:31.120
 is when to use the function will activate a folder with the extensions are 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.379
 allowed then for example the products hortifruti trash saved you a 

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:37.599
 photo logically that does not 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:39.370
 part of his job 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:40.949
 it's first edition will die 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:44.220
 so I can not say which files can or can not 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.700
 be saved the server a very interesting function that sorting files 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.139
 still inside the fsm 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:55.029
 and has an interesting thing estimates that the disk quota 

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:58.159
 which is completely different from the 2003 version 

00:04:58.159 --> 00:05:02.409
 a function that has evolved a lot or should I define how much each user can 

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:03.189
 to save 

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:07.259
 in each of the parts now disk is directed to the non-folder 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:10.259
 more volume 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:15.520
 let's work also with radius of moisture does 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.370
 to create a safe environment 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.760
 where even if one of the time hds 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.529
 I can have this information 

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:23.870
 We are going to build the city. 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:26.889
 configure city via software and also 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:30.270
 it is for this will be the disguised that is today one of the disks 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:36.309
 We will also work with Fco's resources. 

00:05:36.309 --> 00:05:38.999
 in Distributed File System 

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:41.999
 where I will have information about two servers 

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:47.069
 but with the advantage of the user there will be a single share by 

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:47.750
 example 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:48.880
 teachers let's go 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.470
 and when it was in training but sharing 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:55.659
 is replicated the information that every common server when a server 2 

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:59.419
 in case one of the servers is not available 

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:02.800
 transparent information server did not arrive 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.680
 this greatly increases safety 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.680
 and also have a load balancing for you to have more commitment 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.270
 note the file server 

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:15.039
 not enough stories 

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:16.909
 that will be what it was 

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:20.589
 for example the user side the sales sector ended up paying a file 

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:24.569
 and then everyone deleting what's missing here 

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:28.520
 with this feature enabled on the public query server where it was historical 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.059
 to file 

00:06:30.059 --> 00:06:33.559
 we're going to work both on victory and filtering out what's for 

00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:35.580
 make life easier for the administrator 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:40.169
 because a complicated thing man of the cmvm game and if these nobles personal 

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:41.719
 thousands of Somalis 

00:06:41.719 --> 00:06:45.889
 and you get lost in tones both audit and create a resource 

00:06:45.889 --> 00:06:48.800
 for futrono blogs to be made 

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.910
 so it's there you can follow now 

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:53.309
 the oral sequence simply 

00:06:53.309 --> 00:06:56.199
 It's a guess. 

00:06:56.199 --> 00:06:59.139
 find them dvd in ct teacher let's dot com 

00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:02.139
 with four years of duration and 39 21 years 

00:07:02.979 --> 00:07:05.539
 To Caesar, let's go to dot com 

00:07:05.539 --> 00:07:07.509
 sharing knowledge
