00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
totally standard and I'm facing a three

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.400 
totally standard and I'm facing a three
bits<00:00:35.130> they<00:00:35.670> short<00:00:35.969> stack<00:00:36.180> folds<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:36.840> here<00:00:37.290> we

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
bits they short stack folds and here we

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.500 
bits they short stack folds and here we
are<00:00:37.440> so<00:00:38.070> in<00:00:38.309> this<00:00:38.430> situation<00:00:38.610> here<00:00:39.210> it<00:00:39.270> assigns

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
are so in this situation here it assigns

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.080 
are so in this situation here it assigns
the<00:00:39.750> four<00:00:39.960> bit<00:00:40.170> and<00:00:40.530> he<00:00:40.649> says<00:00:40.920> I<00:00:41.250> decided<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:42.000> go

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
the four bit and he says I decided to go

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.790 
the four bit and he says I decided to go
to<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.270> four<00:00:42.480> bed<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:42.840> I'm<00:00:42.899> not<00:00:43.079> sure<00:00:43.320> this<00:00:43.620> is

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
to the four bed and I'm not sure this is

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.799 
to the four bed and I'm not sure this is
the<00:00:43.920> mistake<00:00:44.219> or<00:00:44.550> should<00:00:44.820> I<00:00:44.879> just<00:00:44.910> flat<00:00:45.450> here

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
the mistake or should I just flat here

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.450 
the mistake or should I just flat here
okay<00:00:46.289> so<00:00:46.350> I<00:00:46.500> just<00:00:46.649> want<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:46.890> talk<00:00:47.070> about<00:00:47.100> this

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
okay so I just want to talk about this

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.190 
okay so I just want to talk about this
spot<00:00:47.670> conceptually<00:00:48.270> for<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.600> moment<00:00:48.960> because<00:00:49.050> I

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
spot conceptually for a moment because I

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.290 
spot conceptually for a moment because I
think<00:00:49.230> it's<00:00:49.500> kind<00:00:49.649> of<00:00:49.800> important<00:00:50.309> so<00:00:50.520> in<00:00:51.180> this

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
think it's kind of important so in this

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.670 
think it's kind of important so in this
situation<00:00:51.539> let's<00:00:52.050> think<00:00:52.170> about<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.530> big

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
situation let's think about the big

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.590 
situation let's think about the big
blinds<00:00:52.890> range<00:00:53.219> so<00:00:53.730> in<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:53.969> big<00:00:54.120> blind<00:00:54.239> three

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
blinds range so in the big blind three

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.299 
blinds range so in the big blind three
bits<00:00:54.780> here<00:00:55.050> I'm<00:00:55.289> actually<00:00:55.440> going<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.770> remove<00:00:56.160> a

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
bits here I'm actually going to remove a

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.250 
bits here I'm actually going to remove a
lot<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.670> Bluffs<00:00:56.940> from<00:00:57.149> his<00:00:57.360> range<00:00:57.600> somebody

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
lot of a Bluffs from his range somebody

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.410 
lot of a Bluffs from his range somebody
because<00:00:58.469> it's<00:00:58.620> pretty<00:00:58.890> likely<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.309> with<00:01:00.270> the

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
because it's pretty likely that with the

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.209 
because it's pretty likely that with the
short<00:01:00.660> stack<00:01:00.870> involved<00:01:01.379> he<00:01:01.469> only<00:01:01.710> has<00:01:01.800> six<00:01:02.070> big

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
short stack involved he only has six big

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.100 
short stack involved he only has six big
blinds<00:01:02.460> left<00:01:02.760> that<00:01:03.059> he's<00:01:03.239> most<00:01:03.539> likely<00:01:03.960> going

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
blinds left that he's most likely going

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.990 
blinds left that he's most likely going
to<00:01:04.170> be<00:01:04.260> getting<00:01:04.500> involved<00:01:04.949> which<00:01:05.700> means

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
to be getting involved which means

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.250 
to be getting involved which means
there's<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.299> decent<00:01:06.479> chance<00:01:06.720> that<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.140> big

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
there's a decent chance that the big

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.810 
there's a decent chance that the big
blind<00:01:07.409> is<00:01:07.560> going<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.770> have<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.130> showdown<00:01:08.580> in

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
blind is going to have to showdown in

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.940 
blind is going to have to showdown in
some<00:01:09.060> way<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.479> because<00:01:09.869> of<00:01:09.900> that<00:01:10.049> I<00:01:10.590> don't

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
some way and because of that I don't

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.469 
some way and because of that I don't
expect<00:01:11.189> him<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.430> be<00:01:11.640> showing<00:01:11.970> up<00:01:12.090> here<00:01:12.330> with

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
expect him to be showing up here with

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.330 
expect him to be showing up here with
things<00:01:12.689> like<00:01:12.930> is<00:01:13.200> for<00:01:13.500> suited<00:01:13.950> or<00:01:14.040> any<00:01:14.220> of<00:01:14.310> that

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
things like is for suited or any of that

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.280 
things like is for suited or any of that
kind<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:14.729> stuff<00:01:14.850> I<00:01:15.240> expect<00:01:15.900> he's<00:01:16.140> probably

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
kind of stuff I expect he's probably

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.080 
kind of stuff I expect he's probably
going<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.619> have<00:01:16.770> more<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.159> value<00:01:17.549> stuff<00:01:17.850> and

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
going to have more the value stuff and

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.240 
going to have more the value stuff and
it's<00:01:18.180> important<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.600> understand<00:01:19.049> what<00:01:20.040> the

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
it's important to understand what the

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.490 
it's important to understand what the
entire<00:01:20.640> hand<00:01:20.909> looks<00:01:21.180> like<00:01:21.390> in<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:22.049> exact

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
entire hand looks like in the exact

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.620 
entire hand looks like in the exact
situation<00:01:22.770> for<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.610> times<00:01:23.880> where<00:01:24.150> someone<00:01:24.509> is

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
situation for the times where someone is

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.630 
situation for the times where someone is
going<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:24.900> like<00:01:25.020> totally<00:01:25.560> delete<00:01:25.950> Bluffs<00:01:26.400> and

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
going to like totally delete Bluffs and

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.310 
going to like totally delete Bluffs and
randomness<00:01:27.090> from<00:01:27.390> their<00:01:27.630> range<00:01:27.840> that's<00:01:28.080> very

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
randomness from their range that's very

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.469 
randomness from their range that's very
very<00:01:28.560> important<00:01:29.070> so<00:01:30.000> when<00:01:30.180> we're<00:01:30.329> sitting

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
very important so when we're sitting

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:31.760 
very important so when we're sitting
here<00:01:30.630> in<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.869> situation<00:01:31.290> like<00:01:31.350> this<00:01:31.470> I<00:01:31.710> think

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
here in a situation like this I think

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.130 
here in a situation like this I think
he's<00:01:32.009> taking<00:01:32.369> those<00:01:32.490> out<00:01:32.759> now<00:01:33.030> unless<00:01:33.810> I<00:01:33.960> think

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
he's taking those out now unless I think

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.630 
he's taking those out now unless I think
he's<00:01:34.259> really<00:01:34.500> nitty<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.130> usually<00:01:35.430> I<00:01:35.490> would

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
he's really nitty and usually I would

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.340 
he's really nitty and usually I would
need<00:01:35.729> information<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.540> prove<00:01:36.780> that<00:01:37.049> I'm

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
need information to prove that I'm

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.480 
need information to prove that I'm
usually<00:01:37.530> not<00:01:37.799> going<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.100> assume<00:01:38.220> that<00:01:38.369> he's

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
usually not going to assume that he's

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.039 
usually not going to assume that he's
only<00:01:38.670> three<00:01:39.030> buddy<00:01:39.210> here<00:01:39.420> with<00:01:39.540> Queens<00:01:39.810> plus

only three buddy here with Queens plus

only three buddy here with Queens plus
he's<00:01:40.259> King<00:01:40.560> I'm<00:01:40.770> usually<00:01:40.950> going<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.250> assume

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
he's King I'm usually going to assume

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.469 
he's King I'm usually going to assume
that<00:01:41.610> it's<00:01:41.700> going<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.850> be<00:01:41.939> a<00:01:41.970> little<00:01:42.150> bit<00:01:42.329> wider

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
that it's going to be a little bit wider

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.300 
that it's going to be a little bit wider
than<00:01:42.659> that<00:01:43.020> probably<00:01:43.799> going<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.040> include

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
than that probably going to include

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.069 
than that probably going to include
things<00:01:44.490> like<00:01:44.640> tens<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.270> Jack's<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.869> maybe

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
things like tens and Jack's and maybe

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.810 
things like tens and Jack's and maybe
he's<00:01:46.259> queen<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:46.950> maybe<00:01:47.130> in<00:01:47.280> pocket<00:01:47.610> nines

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
he's queen and maybe in pocket nines

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.219 
he's queen and maybe in pocket nines
those<00:01:48.149> kind<00:01:48.390> of<00:01:48.450> things<00:01:48.659> so<00:01:48.780> I'm<00:01:48.899> assuming

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
those kind of things so I'm assuming

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.749 
those kind of things so I'm assuming
that<00:01:49.290> it's<00:01:49.500> wider<00:01:49.770> than<00:01:50.070> just<00:01:50.100> Queens<00:01:50.520> plus

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
that it's wider than just Queens plus

plus C's king queen does not doing well

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.840 
plus C's king queen does not doing well
enough<00:01:54.899> to<00:01:55.170> want<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.560> four<00:01:55.770> bet<00:01:55.979> stack<00:01:56.280> off<00:01:56.549> and

given the size we can never format fold
you<00:02:00.149> know<00:02:00.240> once<00:02:00.420> you<00:02:00.509> put<00:02:00.750> in<00:02:00.840> more<00:02:01.020> than<00:02:01.079> a

you know once you put in more than a

you know once you put in more than a
third<00:02:01.469> of<00:02:01.560> your<00:02:01.740> effective<00:02:02.100> stack<00:02:02.340> preflop<00:02:02.850> if

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
third of your effective stack preflop if

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.359 
third of your effective stack preflop if
you<00:02:03.180> end<00:02:03.390> up<00:02:03.540> facing<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.049> jam<00:02:04.320> preflop<00:02:04.860> you're

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
you end up facing the jam preflop you're

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.830 
you end up facing the jam preflop you're
priced<00:02:05.670> into<00:02:05.909> making<00:02:06.149> a<00:02:06.360> call<00:02:06.570> you're<00:02:06.719> going

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
priced into making a call you're going

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.029 
priced into making a call you're going
to<00:02:06.899> be<00:02:06.990> getting<00:02:07.200> a<00:02:07.259> pretty<00:02:07.469> good<00:02:07.560> price<00:02:07.860> at

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
to be getting a pretty good price at

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.889 
to be getting a pretty good price at
that<00:02:08.129> point<00:02:08.429> it's<00:02:08.789> kind<00:02:09.000> of<00:02:09.179> criminal<00:02:09.569> to<00:02:09.690> fold

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
that point it's kind of criminal to fold

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:10.730 
that point it's kind of criminal to fold
at<00:02:10.050> that<00:02:10.200> point

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
at that point

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.920 
at that point
so<00:02:11.550> it's<00:02:11.700> very<00:02:11.880> very<00:02:12.180> important<00:02:12.660> that's<00:02:12.750> why

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
so it's very very important that's why

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.320 
so it's very very important that's why

for bedding with total nonsense is I'm

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:21.680 
for bedding with total nonsense is I'm
going<00:02:20.820> to<00:02:20.880> for<00:02:21.090> bed<00:02:21.240> -<00:02:21.360> somewhere<00:02:21.630> between

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
going to for bed - somewhere between

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.500 
going to for bed - somewhere between
like<00:02:21.990> 20<00:02:22.470> to<00:02:22.590> 25<00:02:23.040> big<00:02:23.280> blinds<00:02:23.520> so<00:02:24.210> in<00:02:24.360> this

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
like 20 to 25 big blinds so in this

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.980 
like 20 to 25 big blinds so in this
situation<00:02:24.870> somewhere<00:02:25.620> around<00:02:25.710> like<00:02:26.010> 230<00:02:26.640> or

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
situation somewhere around like 230 or

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:28.760 
situation somewhere around like 230 or
250<00:02:27.990> is<00:02:28.170> definite<00:02:28.500> going<00:02:28.620> to<00:02:28.680> be

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
250 is definite going to be

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.740 
250 is definite going to be
significantly<00:02:29.520> better<00:02:29.610> than<00:02:29.850> going<00:02:30.330> more

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
significantly better than going more

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.350 
significantly better than going more
than<00:02:30.810> one<00:02:31.260> third<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.830> effective<00:02:32.310> stack<00:02:32.610> so<00:02:33.240> at

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
than one third the effective stack so at

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.360 
than one third the effective stack so at
least<00:02:33.510> keep<00:02:33.690> those<00:02:33.900> things<00:02:34.050> in<00:02:34.260> mind<00:02:34.320> here<00:02:34.770> and

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
least keep those things in mind here and

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.700

much much much more on board of this and

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.050 
much much much more on board of this and
again<00:02:58.380> it's<00:02:58.650> totally<00:02:58.920> done<00:02:59.310> with<00:02:59.370> a<00:02:59.550> value

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
again it's totally done with a value

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.030 
again it's totally done with a value
mindset<00:03:00.570> or<00:03:00.780> just<00:03:01.050> go<00:03:01.200> forward<00:03:01.470> from<00:03:01.800> there

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
mindset or just go forward from there

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.010 
mindset or just go forward from there
okay<00:03:02.730> so<00:03:02.790> as<00:03:03.090> played<00:03:03.450> we<00:03:03.690> end<00:03:03.810> up<00:03:03.900> getting

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
okay so as played we end up getting

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.130 
okay so as played we end up getting
called<00:03:04.410> end<00:03:04.770> up<00:03:05.070> going<00:03:05.340> here<00:03:05.700> he<00:03:06.150> checks<00:03:06.510> here

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
called end up going here he checks here

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.830 
called end up going here he checks here
decides<00:03:07.470> the<00:03:07.680> jam<00:03:07.920> and<00:03:08.220> Liam<00:03:09.090> says<00:03:09.360> I'm<00:03:09.630> not

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
decides the jam and Liam says I'm not

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.410 
decides the jam and Liam says I'm not
sure<00:03:10.110> if<00:03:10.260> I<00:03:10.350> should<00:03:10.380> be<00:03:10.560> checking<00:03:10.890> behind<00:03:11.160> so<00:03:12.000> I

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
sure if I should be checking behind so I

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.760 
sure if I should be checking behind so I
want<00:03:12.660> to<00:03:12.690> talk<00:03:12.810> about<00:03:12.930> this<00:03:13.110> for<00:03:13.320> a<00:03:13.380> moment<00:03:13.470> cuz

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
want to talk about this for a moment cuz

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.710 
want to talk about this for a moment cuz
this<00:03:13.830> is<00:03:14.010> kind<00:03:14.190> of<00:03:14.250> an<00:03:14.370> important<00:03:14.850> situation

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
this is kind of an important situation

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.110 
this is kind of an important situation
it's<00:03:16.080> about<00:03:16.440> 1s<00:03:17.190> PR<00:03:17.460> it's<00:03:17.550> actually<00:03:17.760> less<00:03:17.940> than

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
it's about 1s PR it's actually less than

it's about 1s PR it's actually less than
1<00:03:18.270> s<00:03:18.420> PR<00:03:18.780> and<00:03:19.400> 1's<00:03:20.400> PR<00:03:20.700> pots<00:03:20.910> are<00:03:21.090> usually

1 s PR and 1's PR pots are usually

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.450 
1 s PR and 1's PR pots are usually
pretty<00:03:21.570> damn<00:03:21.810> simple<00:03:22.110> and<00:03:22.440> this<00:03:23.130> is<00:03:23.190> one<00:03:23.430> of

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:23.460 
pretty damn simple and this is one of

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.400 
pretty damn simple and this is one of
those<00:03:23.580> situations<00:03:23.790> where<00:03:24.270> it's<00:03:24.510> not<00:03:24.720> quite<00:03:25.080> so

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
those situations where it's not quite so

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.470 
those situations where it's not quite so
clear<00:03:25.440> only<00:03:26.280> because<00:03:26.610> this<00:03:26.760> is<00:03:26.970> like<00:03:27.150> the

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
clear only because this is like the

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.420 
clear only because this is like the
absolute<00:03:27.720> worst<00:03:28.440> texture<00:03:28.950> we<00:03:29.070> could<00:03:29.310> have

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
absolute worst texture we could have

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.070 
absolute worst texture we could have
caught<00:03:29.640> there<00:03:29.880> are<00:03:30.000> very<00:03:30.330> few<00:03:30.570> textures<00:03:30.960> that

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
caught there are very few textures that

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.540 
caught there are very few textures that
are<00:03:31.290> going<00:03:31.440> to<00:03:31.530> be<00:03:31.650> worse<00:03:31.860> in<00:03:32.070> this<00:03:32.160> exact

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
are going to be worse in this exact

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.700 
are going to be worse in this exact
situation<00:03:32.840> so<00:03:33.840> I<00:03:33.870> wanted<00:03:34.140> to<00:03:34.200> spend<00:03:34.350> a<00:03:34.590> moment

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:34.710 
situation so I wanted to spend a moment

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:36.530 
situation so I wanted to spend a moment
and<00:03:35.100> break<00:03:35.550> this<00:03:35.730> situation<00:03:36.330> down

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
and break this situation down

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.480 
and break this situation down
mathematically<00:03:36.810> so<00:03:37.800> in<00:03:37.950> order<00:03:38.070> to<00:03:38.220> look<00:03:38.400> at

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:38.490 
mathematically so in order to look at

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.130 
mathematically so in order to look at
this<00:03:38.670> mathematically<00:03:39.390> we<00:03:39.510> can<00:03:39.660> pull<00:03:39.810> out<00:03:39.900> two

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
this mathematically we can pull out two

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.570 
this mathematically we can pull out two
tools<00:03:40.410> we<00:03:40.710> can<00:03:40.860> pull<00:03:40.980> out<00:03:41.070> our<00:03:41.190> fold<00:03:41.430> equity

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
tools we can pull out our fold equity

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.670 
tools we can pull out our fold equity
calculator<00:03:42.180> and<00:03:42.720> we<00:03:42.810> can<00:03:42.960> pull<00:03:43.110> out<00:03:43.200> equal<00:03:43.560> a

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
calculator and we can pull out equal a

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.590 
calculator and we can pull out equal a
but<00:03:43.890> we<00:03:43.980> can<00:03:44.100> get<00:03:44.250> started<00:03:44.700> so<00:03:45.060> to<00:03:45.180> use<00:03:45.390> the

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
but we can get started so to use the

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.420 
but we can get started so to use the
folding<00:03:46.050> calculator<00:03:46.590> just<00:03:46.680> need<00:03:46.950> a<00:03:46.980> plug<00:03:47.220> in<00:03:47.340> a

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
folding calculator just need a plug in a

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.550 
folding calculator just need a plug in a
few<00:03:47.580> numbers<00:03:47.730> the<00:03:48.540> effective<00:03:48.960> Jam<00:03:49.230> what<00:03:49.440> we're

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
few numbers the effective Jam what we're

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.070 
few numbers the effective Jam what we're
jamming<00:03:49.860> for<00:03:50.070> right<00:03:50.190> now<00:03:50.220> is<00:03:50.520> 629<00:03:51.240> the<00:03:51.810> pot

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
jamming for right now is 629 the pot

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.040 
jamming for right now is 629 the pot
size<00:03:52.320> is<00:03:52.620> 735<00:03:53.400> and<00:03:53.430> we<00:03:53.850> are<00:03:53.970> facing<00:03:54.210> a<00:03:54.420> bet<00:03:54.600> at<00:03:54.750> 0

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
size is 735 and we are facing a bet at 0

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.050 
size is 735 and we are facing a bet at 0
because<00:03:55.260> well<00:03:55.650> he<00:03:55.950> didn't<00:03:56.190> bet<00:03:56.340> in<00:03:56.520> to<00:03:56.700> us<00:03:56.820> and

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
because well he didn't bet in to us and

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.850 
because well he didn't bet in to us and
then<00:03:57.690> we<00:03:57.780> just<00:03:57.900> need<00:03:58.050> our<00:03:58.080> equity<00:03:58.590> which<00:03:58.710> we

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
then we just need our equity which we

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.800 
then we just need our equity which we
can<00:03:59.040> get<00:03:59.160> from<00:03:59.220> equal<00:03:59.760> AB<00:03:59.910> plug<00:04:00.390> in<00:04:00.540> Queens

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
can get from equal AB plug in Queens

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.140 
can get from equal AB plug in Queens
plug<00:04:01.290> in<00:04:01.410> the<00:04:01.500> board<00:04:01.770> and<00:04:02.130> this<00:04:02.580> is<00:04:02.760> the<00:04:02.910> range

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
plug in the board and this is the range

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.940 
plug in the board and this is the range
of<00:04:03.300> hands<00:04:03.570> that<00:04:03.840> he<00:04:03.990> would<00:04:04.170> three<00:04:04.620> bets

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
of hands that he would three bets

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.910 
of hands that he would three bets
call<00:04:05.550> your<00:04:05.760> format<00:04:06.150> and<00:04:06.450> call<00:04:07.290> your<00:04:07.440> jam<00:04:07.710> with

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
call your format and call your jam with

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.760 
call your format and call your jam with
so<00:04:08.730> let's<00:04:08.940> give<00:04:09.120> a<00:04:09.150> pretty<00:04:09.600> snug<00:04:10.050> range<00:04:10.380> of

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:10.770 
so let's give a pretty snug range of

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:12.650 
so let's give a pretty snug range of
tens<00:04:11.070> plus<00:04:11.340> a<00:04:11.550> sking<00:04:11.910> we'll<00:04:12.150> talk<00:04:12.300> about<00:04:12.420> this

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
tens plus a sking we'll talk about this

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.440 
tens plus a sking we'll talk about this
range<00:04:12.930> in<00:04:13.080> a<00:04:13.140> moment<00:04:13.530> go<00:04:13.890> to<00:04:13.950> ok<00:04:14.400> evaluate<00:04:15.270> it

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
range in a moment go to ok evaluate it

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.729 
range in a moment go to ok evaluate it
notice<00:04:15.870> that<00:04:15.960> we<00:04:16.080> have<00:04:16.109> 17<00:04:16.890> percent<00:04:17.250> equity

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
notice that we have 17 percent equity

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.729 
notice that we have 17 percent equity
so<00:04:18.579> against<00:04:19.359> that<00:04:19.539> range<00:04:19.870> and<00:04:20.410> just<00:04:20.620> in

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
so against that range and just in

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:22.559 
so against that range and just in
general<00:04:20.859> we<00:04:21.250> would<00:04:21.430> need<00:04:21.549> 28<00:04:22.120> percent<00:04:22.479> of

00:04:22.559 --> 00:04:22.569 
general we would need 28 percent of

00:04:22.569 --> 00:04:24.540 
general we would need 28 percent of
folds<00:04:22.840> or<00:04:22.960> more<00:04:23.380> and<00:04:23.740> obviously<00:04:24.160> we'd<00:04:24.340> want

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
folds or more and obviously we'd want

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.700 
folds or more and obviously we'd want
much<00:04:24.759> more<00:04:24.789> that<00:04:25.180> in<00:04:25.330> order<00:04:25.569> to<00:04:25.600> make<00:04:26.199> profit

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
much more that in order to make profit

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.640 
much more that in order to make profit
now<00:04:27.490> the<00:04:27.550> issue<00:04:27.849> here<00:04:28.360> is<00:04:28.479> simply<00:04:28.810> this<00:04:29.080> if

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
now the issue here is simply this if

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.529 
now the issue here is simply this if
this<00:04:29.949> is<00:04:30.009> the<00:04:30.340> range<00:04:30.550> of<00:04:30.789> hands<00:04:31.180> that<00:04:31.360> he's

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:31.539 
this is the range of hands that he's

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:33.930 
this is the range of hands that he's
going<00:04:31.840> to<00:04:32.050> call<00:04:32.590> the<00:04:32.710> format<00:04:33.069> and<00:04:33.280> call<00:04:33.789> our

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
going to call the format and call our

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.570 
going to call the format and call our
jam<00:04:34.180> with<00:04:34.449> what<00:04:35.139> is<00:04:35.380> he<00:04:35.560> possibly<00:04:35.830> folding

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
jam with what is he possibly folding

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.210 
jam with what is he possibly folding
right<00:04:37.150> I<00:04:37.360> mean<00:04:37.569> unless<00:04:37.750> he<00:04:38.080> has<00:04:38.259> like<00:04:38.620> a<00:04:38.830> lot<00:04:39.160> of

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
right I mean unless he has like a lot of

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.999 
right I mean unless he has like a lot of
pocket<00:04:39.759> pairs<00:04:40.060> or<00:04:40.449> maybe<00:04:41.139> has<00:04:41.470> some<00:04:41.770> things

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:42.009 
pocket pairs or maybe has some things

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:44.100 
pocket pairs or maybe has some things
like<00:04:42.280> I<00:04:42.490> don't<00:04:42.669> know<00:04:42.789> queen<00:04:43.180> nine<00:04:43.419> suited<00:04:43.960> that

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
like I don't know queen nine suited that

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.960 
like I don't know queen nine suited that
would<00:04:44.259> fold<00:04:44.560> or<00:04:44.830> maybe<00:04:44.979> a<00:04:45.099> weak<00:04:45.370> ace<00:04:45.580> that<00:04:45.849> we

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
would fold or maybe a weak ace that we

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.360 
would fold or maybe a weak ace that we
consider<00:04:46.360> folding<00:04:46.900> or<00:04:47.259> you<00:04:47.590> know<00:04:47.680> some<00:04:47.949> total

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
consider folding or you know some total

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.550 
consider folding or you know some total
junk<00:04:48.720> chances<00:04:49.720> are<00:04:49.870> there's<00:04:50.080> not<00:04:50.259> going<00:04:50.440> to<00:04:50.500> be

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
junk chances are there's not going to be

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.439 
junk chances are there's not going to be
a<00:04:50.620> lot<00:04:50.800> of<00:04:50.830> folding<00:04:51.310> happening<00:04:51.820> which<00:04:52.150> means

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:52.449 
a lot of folding happening which means

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:54.600 
a lot of folding happening which means
probably<00:04:53.259> not<00:04:53.410> going<00:04:53.560> to<00:04:53.650> get<00:04:53.800> the<00:04:54.160> folds<00:04:54.580> that

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
probably not going to get the folds that

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.310 
probably not going to get the folds that
we<00:04:54.789> need<00:04:55.030> which<00:04:55.389> means<00:04:55.419> we'd<00:04:55.900> probably<00:04:56.110> be

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
we need which means we'd probably be

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.080 
we need which means we'd probably be
better<00:04:56.590> off<00:04:56.710> just<00:04:56.860> say<00:04:57.280> and<00:04:57.430> forget<00:04:57.789> it

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
better off just say and forget it

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.270 
better off just say and forget it
checking<00:04:58.750> behind<00:04:59.139> and<00:04:59.530> just<00:04:59.710> kind<00:04:59.889> of<00:04:59.949> hating

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
checking behind and just kind of hating

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.089 
checking behind and just kind of hating
life<00:05:00.430> hoping<00:05:00.910> that<00:05:01.030> we<00:05:01.120> improve<00:05:01.449> for<00:05:01.780> free<00:05:02.099> you

00:05:03.089 --> 00:05:03.099

life hoping that we improve for free you
know<00:05:03.220> I've<00:05:03.430> talked<00:05:03.669> in<00:05:03.789> the<00:05:03.880> past<00:05:04.030> about<00:05:04.240> how<00:05:04.509> I

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:04.539 
know I've talked in the past about how I

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:06.629 
know I've talked in the past about how I
like<00:05:04.840> to<00:05:04.960> play<00:05:05.139> one<00:05:05.380> SBR<00:05:05.830> less<00:05:06.190> than<00:05:06.400> one<00:05:06.520> SP

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:06.639 
like to play one SBR less than one SP

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:08.100 
like to play one SBR less than one SP
our<00:05:06.910> pots<00:05:07.150> and<00:05:07.270> it's<00:05:07.449> usually<00:05:07.599> just<00:05:07.810> by

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
our pots and it's usually just by

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.159 
our pots and it's usually just by
straight-up<00:05:08.590> jamming<00:05:09.220> but<00:05:09.909> this<00:05:10.330> is<00:05:10.539> a<00:05:10.570> very

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:11.169 
straight-up jamming but this is a very

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:13.469 
straight-up jamming but this is a very
specific<00:05:11.530> texture<00:05:12.310> because<00:05:12.759> this<00:05:12.970> texture

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:13.479 
specific texture because this texture

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:16.399 
specific texture because this texture
just<00:05:13.770> absolutely<00:05:14.770> nails<00:05:15.580> his<00:05:16.000> range

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:16.409 
just absolutely nails his range

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:20.279 
just absolutely nails his range
absolutely<00:05:17.409> destroys<00:05:18.250> it<00:05:18.490> so<00:05:19.419> that's<00:05:20.020> with

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:20.289 
absolutely destroys it so that's with

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:22.350 
absolutely destroys it so that's with
that<00:05:20.560> range<00:05:21.069> assumption<00:05:21.610> though<00:05:21.789> let's<00:05:22.180> say

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
that range assumption though let's say

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.790 
that range assumption though let's say
you<00:05:22.419> think<00:05:22.750> that<00:05:22.870> he's<00:05:23.080> the<00:05:23.110> kind<00:05:23.409> of<00:05:23.470> guy<00:05:23.530> that

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
you think that he's the kind of guy that

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.010 
you think that he's the kind of guy that
would<00:05:24.009> have<00:05:24.250> five<00:05:24.550> bet<00:05:24.789> preflop<00:05:25.330> with<00:05:25.630> Queens

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
would have five bet preflop with Queens

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.129 
would have five bet preflop with Queens
+<00:05:26.320> Ace<00:05:26.590> King<00:05:26.860> well<00:05:27.639> then<00:05:28.120> when<00:05:28.389> he<00:05:28.570> gets<00:05:28.750> to<00:05:29.020> the

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:29.139 
+ Ace King well then when he gets to the

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:31.469 
+ Ace King well then when he gets to the
flop<00:05:29.440> I<00:05:29.770> mean<00:05:30.099> he<00:05:30.220> really<00:05:30.400> has<00:05:30.550> sets<00:05:31.000> and<00:05:31.330> then

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:31.479 
flop I mean he really has sets and then

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:32.969 
flop I mean he really has sets and then
maybe<00:05:31.690> you<00:05:31.870> think<00:05:32.080> he<00:05:32.259> has<00:05:32.380> eights<00:05:32.710> and<00:05:32.919> nines

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:32.979 
maybe you think he has eights and nines

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:34.620 
maybe you think he has eights and nines
occasionally<00:05:33.759> which<00:05:33.940> will<00:05:34.090> probably<00:05:34.300> hate

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:34.630 
occasionally which will probably hate

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:36.540 
occasionally which will probably hate
life<00:05:34.930> and<00:05:35.169> consider<00:05:35.469> folding<00:05:35.919> on<00:05:36.039> this<00:05:36.250> board

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 
life and consider folding on this board

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.850 
life and consider folding on this board
which<00:05:37.449> does<00:05:37.840> a<00:05:37.870> couple<00:05:38.199> different<00:05:38.620> things

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860 
which does a couple different things

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.640 
which does a couple different things
right<00:05:39.280> so<00:05:39.729> this<00:05:40.120> means<00:05:40.479> that<00:05:40.659> if<00:05:40.870> he<00:05:41.050> got<00:05:41.259> here

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.650 
right so this means that if he got here

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:43.830 
right so this means that if he got here
and<00:05:41.830> he<00:05:42.190> would<00:05:42.310> fold<00:05:42.639> eights<00:05:43.090> and<00:05:43.300> nines<00:05:43.360> well

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 
and he would fold eights and nines well

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.480 
and he would fold eights and nines well
he's<00:05:43.990> actually<00:05:44.289> folding<00:05:44.680> a<00:05:44.770> decent<00:05:45.159> chunk<00:05:45.280> of

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:45.490 
he's actually folding a decent chunk of

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.629 
he's actually folding a decent chunk of
combos<00:05:45.880> of<00:05:46.090> this<00:05:46.780> this<00:05:46.990> is<00:05:47.050> 18<00:05:47.710> total<00:05:47.949> combo<00:05:48.490> do

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:48.639 
combos of this this is 18 total combo do

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:50.100 
combos of this this is 18 total combo do
you<00:05:48.699> think<00:05:48.849> he's<00:05:48.969> going<00:05:49.090> to<00:05:49.180> fold<00:05:49.389> 12<00:05:49.750> and

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
you think he's going to fold 12 and

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:51.870 
you think he's going to fold 12 and
obviously<00:05:50.889> you're<00:05:51.039> generating<00:05:51.430> folds

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:51.880 
obviously you're generating folds

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.939 
obviously you're generating folds
two-thirds<00:05:52.270> of<00:05:52.449> time<00:05:52.630> that's<00:05:53.020> a<00:05:53.169> fantastic

00:05:53.939 --> 00:05:53.949 
two-thirds of time that's a fantastic

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:56.969 
two-thirds of time that's a fantastic
thing<00:05:54.310> for<00:05:54.849> you<00:05:55.000> so<00:05:55.990> if<00:05:56.320> you<00:05:56.469> looked<00:05:56.680> at<00:05:56.860> it

00:05:56.969 --> 00:05:56.979 
thing for you so if you looked at it

00:05:56.979 --> 00:05:59.129 
thing for you so if you looked at it
that<00:05:57.130> way<00:05:57.190> then<00:05:57.969> your<00:05:58.180> jam<00:05:58.449> would<00:05:58.599> be<00:05:58.750> totally

00:05:59.129 --> 00:05:59.139 
that way then your jam would be totally

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:01.620 
that way then your jam would be totally
fine<00:05:59.349> and<00:05:59.680> then<00:06:00.669> I<00:06:00.699> really<00:06:01.180> wouldn't<00:06:01.419> have<00:06:01.479> a

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:01.630 
fine and then I really wouldn't have a

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:03.300 
fine and then I really wouldn't have a
problem<00:06:02.080> with<00:06:02.199> this<00:06:02.349> so<00:06:02.530> as<00:06:02.710> always<00:06:03.099> it's

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:03.310 
problem with this so as always it's

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:04.529 
problem with this so as always it's
going<00:06:03.430> to<00:06:03.490> be<00:06:03.580> based<00:06:03.789> on<00:06:04.030> the<00:06:04.180> range

00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:04.539 
going to be based on the range

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:06.629 
going to be based on the range
assumptions<00:06:05.169> that<00:06:05.229> you<00:06:05.440> make<00:06:05.469> my<00:06:06.009> issue<00:06:06.219> here

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:06.639 
assumptions that you make my issue here

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:07.980 
assumptions that you make my issue here
I<00:06:06.699> think<00:06:07.150> is<00:06:07.270> that<00:06:07.300> you're<00:06:07.599> going<00:06:07.810> to<00:06:07.870> get

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:07.990

snapped off a huge chunk of the time

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:11.939 
snapped off a huge chunk of the time
you're<00:06:10.270> going<00:06:10.389> to<00:06:10.449> have<00:06:10.509> very<00:06:11.139> minimal<00:06:11.380> equity

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:11.949 
you're going to have very minimal equity

you're going to have very minimal equity
the<00:06:12.070> times<00:06:12.310> you<00:06:12.460> do<00:06:12.669> get<00:06:12.880> snapped<00:06:13.210> off<00:06:13.479> and

00:06:13.709 --> 00:06:13.719 
the times you do get snapped off and

00:06:13.719 --> 00:06:16.350 
the times you do get snapped off and
that<00:06:14.500> you<00:06:14.680> really<00:06:15.130> cannot<00:06:15.460> expect<00:06:15.969> enough

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:16.360 
that you really cannot expect enough

that you really cannot expect enough
folds<00:06:16.810> and<00:06:16.960> this<00:06:17.169> unfortunately<00:06:17.770> is<00:06:17.860> just<00:06:18.070> a

folds and this unfortunately is just a

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:19.980

00:06:26.939 --> 00:06:26.949 
of other flops this is going to be a

but<00:06:29.590> on<00:06:29.710> this<00:06:29.889> exact<00:06:30.400> specific<00:06:31.060> texture<00:06:31.509> I

00:06:31.529 --> 00:06:31.539 
but on this exact specific texture I

00:06:31.539 --> 00:06:33.059 
but on this exact specific texture I
actually<00:06:31.900> think<00:06:32.199> this<00:06:32.379> Jam<00:06:32.650> is<00:06:32.680> going<00:06:32.919> to<00:06:32.979> be

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:33.069 
actually think this Jam is going to be

00:06:33.069 --> 00:06:34.860 
actually think this Jam is going to be
kind<00:06:33.340> of<00:06:33.400> bad<00:06:33.610> and<00:06:33.969> I'm<00:06:34.029> really<00:06:34.240> not<00:06:34.419> shocked

kind of bad and I'm really not shocked

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:37.499 
kind of bad and I'm really not shocked
that<00:06:34.990> we<00:06:35.169> get<00:06:35.319> snapped<00:06:35.710> off<00:06:35.979> by<00:06:36.610> exactly<00:06:37.270> this

00:06:37.499 --> 00:06:37.509 
that we get snapped off by exactly this

00:06:37.509 --> 00:06:39.420 
that we get snapped off by exactly this
kind<00:06:37.719> of<00:06:37.840> hand<00:06:38.110> I<00:06:38.229> mean<00:06:38.349> I<00:06:38.409> expect<00:06:38.860> this<00:06:39.009> no

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:39.430 
kind of hand I mean I expect this no

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:40.890 
kind of hand I mean I expect this no
matter<00:06:39.639> what<00:06:39.879> range<00:06:40.150> assumption<00:06:40.689> that<00:06:40.719> I

matter what range assumption that I
assign<00:06:41.590> him<00:06:41.830> I<00:06:42.039> just<00:06:42.370> think<00:06:42.909> that<00:06:43.120> against

00:06:43.589 --> 00:06:43.599 
assign him I just think that against

snapped off a huge chunk of the time and
