00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 hey and welcome here too 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.890
 Another tutorial today is there 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.049
 above and I want my cpu 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.030
 overclocking in this case comes that 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.120
 useful tool of gigabytes in action 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.889
 the gbe coc continues then of course 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.269
 It's worth it after the intro 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.269
 as always have fun with this video 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.900
 but before I go with the 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.430
 right clock on a cpu I would like 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.890
 first of all , what to do 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:33.500
 definitely should consider before getting one 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.269
 cpu overclocked basically you need 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.460
 a corresponding cooling is here 

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:39.379
 not the intel as frame the boxed 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.510
 meant cooler but a right one 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:44.030
 Cooling whether air or water cooling 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.040
 here is only once principle matter 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.720
 furthermore we need at inter 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.640
 for example, a corresponding mainboard 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.829
 we have an internist for 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.870
 for example, a cpu with the freely selectable 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:55.910
 multiplier and accordingly 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.980
 we also need a mainboard what the 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.199
 overclocking feature now offers 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.390
 is it so that also cheaper mainboards 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:05.089
 with the b 85 chipsets also the 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.920
 make use of the function 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:10.009
 but in my opinion relatively little 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.390
 Sinn a 300 euro cpu to 61 eur 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:12.679
 Mainboard overclock 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.789
 I would be at this point first 

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:15.080
 What do you think about it? 

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:17.210
 write in any case in the 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.280
 comments on how you think about it 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.990
 Sinn makes an expensive cdu on one 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.789
 cheap mainboard to overclock 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.500
 the same is true for the amd 

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:27.619
 whether it makes sense in this case 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.239
 an 8 kern fx cpu on a cheaper 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.770
 to shake the mainboard 

00:01:29.239 --> 00:01:32.720
 Well , one should definitely be good 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.060
 Note that you can not rank too forward 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.720
 go and grab that means in 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.340
 this case 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.660
 You should not be too big in general 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.880
 steps dare but in small 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.890
 step on and look where 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.720
 because now the limits are feasible 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.890
 it with the appropriate voltage and 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.140
 In any case you should go to the 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.090
 temperature note whether the overclocking 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.830
 a cpu usually makes sense and whether 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.209
 you need it at all here 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.770
 left to him 

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:56.450
 I would like your opinion 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.819
 So please write something interesting 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.739
 to a statement in the comment box 

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:03.020
 good then proven by his swivel 

00:02:00.739 --> 00:02:05.569
 directly into the gigabyte bios of the 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.039
 gigabyte g1 sniper in the 3 we look 

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:10.480
 directly to how to do it now 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:12.920
 for example, an easy 3770 k 

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:15.050
 overclocked before again the same 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.640
 Ask 3000 times in the comment box 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.860
 want the time to say how you have to head 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.120
 now in the efi bios you walk in 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.069
 presses the power button in this case 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.010
 from the computer and then presses so long 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:27.769
 the remove button on the keyboard until 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.230
 the uefi bios surface appears 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:32.390
 arrived in july fever by gigabyte 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.460
 First of all, we have to take care of her 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.950
 to use at isio c function 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.260
 expanded area in the 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.050
 Frequency adjustment go see this 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.989
 We then gave different information as well 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:47.050
 the big club of 100 megahertz as well 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:49.180
 the multiplier 535 multiplier 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:52.209
 here as well cpu marks tact ray 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:55.540
 show in this case default to 35 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:57.340
 means 35 times 100 power in this 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.680
 case 3.5 ghz 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.530
 to increase it by a cpu now 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.599
 To overclock we have to clock this cpu 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.610
 simply increase the ratio 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:08.950
 the whole thing goes through this in this case 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.840
 Press the plus button on the keyboard 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.269
 before that we need to first the 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.250
 click blue box where the 35 in it 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:17.470
 stands with the plus button increase and 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.720
 already increases the clocking of the cpu 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.459
 and of course you can see that as well 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.650
 the cdu timing increases 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:25.870
 For example, here is no multiplier 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.750
 from 40 we have a contact of 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:31.030
 4 gigahertz to be safe now 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.519
 that the cpu is on an overclocking of 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.840
 For example, Feri has enough 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.640
 So stream gets the boy 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.620
 you have to have power supply now 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.430
 in the point extended frequency 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.350
 go recruitment 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.750
 Here we see different 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.910
 for example, the point 3d 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.430
 power control should be everything 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.350
 So every point on car is what 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.239
 This is also completely correct 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.709
 then we go to the point cpu core 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:55.870
 voltage control 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:59.260
 Here we also see the reason the wanted 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.709
 Basic voltage of 114 5 volts on car 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.329
 posed 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:03.850
 maybe first at 4 gigahertz 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:05.200
 out loud gigabyte that is in 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:07.359
 so also by gb so 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.220
 ensured that you leave this on auto 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:11.769
 can then save the whole easy 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:14.500
 and see if the whole thing is going on 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:16.359
 check in this case with cpu z 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.400
 after now so the settings in 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.289
 uefi bios have saved and the 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.820
 We have seen computers restart 

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:23.680
 now here cpu z 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.080
 in the area core clock we see now 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.210
 that too much bghz really to the 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:32.280
 in this case, given a little inaccurate 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:34.630
 since we have a cost of 4000 35 62 mega 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:38.260
 composed of the multiplier 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:40.810
 of 40 in the bios indicated cpu tact ratio 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:44.009
 and imba speed in bios given as 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:46.259
 host loose or rostock of 100 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:50.009
 89 megahertz, therefore, comes this inaccurate 

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:52.169
 specification of 4.000 35 62 mega 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:54.779
 but we see clearly here with the 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:57.180
 gigabyte isio c dur is it possible 

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:59.189
 even for beginners a cpu altogether 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.349
 easy to overclock important here 

00:04:59.189 --> 00:05:03.059
 still follow the rules or the 

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:05.939
 I pay attention to you at the beginning 

00:05:03.059 --> 00:05:07.529
 the video called final 

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:10.139
 you could now test the overclocking 

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:12.240
 with the help of prime 95 whether the whole thing out 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:14.460
 stable if that is the case 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.969
 So the attitude in July bronze 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.529
 to let 

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:18.930
 if that is not the case you could 

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:20.550
 for example, the cpu core is waiting 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.649
 increase slightly and then turn to 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.629
 test whether the now turn to ranges 

00:05:22.649 --> 00:05:27.029
 and the calculator think so also stable 

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:28.919
 By the way, this is the way it works 

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:30.599
 So it's been a long time under gaming 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:32.550
 as well as video editing for example 

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:35.009
 So here I can say the exhibition 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.389
 work so far perfect if you 

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:38.159
 I liked the video 

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:40.559
 of course, as always, about a positive 

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:42.569
 rating look forward to a comment if you 

00:05:40.559 --> 00:05:44.490
 other ideas or suggestions hate and 

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:46.589
 also like to share your opinion 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.539
 Otherwise, I would like to ask about that 

00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:50.189
 contact form on my website as 

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:51.539
 also on youtube then we'll see you in 

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:53.370
 this case in the next video of course 

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:55.319
 again if you want to be there is 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:57.389
 just press the abo button with it 

00:05:55.319 --> 00:05:58.860
 you will not miss any more videos 

00:05:57.389 --> 00:06:02.419
 thank you for watching 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:02.419
 we'll see you again
