00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:06.890
 today we are going to make nativity cakes and 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:09.380
 we will need these two ingredients 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:12.110
 sheets of fresh puff pastry 400 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:15.769
 milliliters of cream to assemble with 35% 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:19.190
 fat 100 milliliters of milk 8 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:21.620
 more than egg 200 grams of sugar 2 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:24.110
 spoonfuls of cornstarch the medium skin 

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:26.560
 lemon and icing sugar and cinnamon for 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.560
 decorate 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.520
 The first thing we will do is take some 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.140
 Droplets of oil inside the molds 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.390
 we in this case have used two 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.430
 trays to make cupcakes though 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.430
 We can also use flan molds 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.710
 metallic or silicone with a paper of 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.930
 kitchen we spread the oil all over the 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.210
 surface of the mold so that it remains 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.330
 fully greased and so it's easier 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.260
 remove the cakes once made 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.089
 continuation 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.000
 we develop the sheets of puff pastry 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:58.980
 fresh and with a glass or a cutter 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.110
 smooth cookies between 9 and 10 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.229
 centimeters in diameter we begin to 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.270
 cut the dough we're going to take in the 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.970
 Puff pastry circles trying not to 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.420
 is deformed and we lined the molds with 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.640
 them so there are no bubbles 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.680
 first we adjust the base and then 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.250
 we press the sides to smooth the 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.250
 folds 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.630
 once we have all the molds 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.220
 covered with the puff pastry let's move 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.189
 to make the cream for the filling of 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:39.979
 our cakes in a big fountain 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.979
 we throw the 8 egg yolks and the sugar 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.830
 We beat vigorously with rods 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:48.540
 until the mixture is somewhat spongy 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.540
 and with a light yellow color 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.280
 then we add the cream to mount 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.450
 the milk 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.990
 and the cornstarch we forgot 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.240
 do it but for the cornstarch to 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.150
 Incorporate better to the mix is better if 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.800
 before we dilute it in the milk glass 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.840
 we keep beating well until we do not 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.470
 lumps in the mixture although 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.770
 there is some nothing happens 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.750
 we passed the mixture to the casserole 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.810
 and we also put inside the skin of 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:31.800
 lemon put to heat over medium heat and 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.800
 we stir without stopping 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.480
 when the mixture starts to get 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:42.189
 We remove the fire and continue 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.459
 stirring until you get a cream 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:44.459
 fine 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.870
 we let it be tempered and we will take advantage 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:53.799
 that time to preheat the oven 250 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.810
 degrees celsius with heat up and down 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:59.090
 When the cream is warm we remove 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.180
 the lemon peel and let's start 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.120
 fill the tarts we have 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.530
 opted to use a pastry bag 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.859
 but they can be filled with a couple of 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:12.290
 spoons the truth is that you use the 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:15.889
 Pastry bag is more effective and less 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.599
 cumbersome we throw cream until cover two 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:19.849
 thirds of the tartaleta's capacity 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:22.849
 since the filling grows a bit in the 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:25.099
 oven and you can leave us once you 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:27.349
 let's have all the pastries stuffed 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:29.810
 We put in the oven average height and 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:31.760
 we bake at 250 degrees for 15 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.879
 minutes or until they are browned a little 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.879
 above 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:43.320
 as you can see they come out somewhat swollen 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:47.190
 but once they cool they settle 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:49.080
 so we quietly took them out and 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.660
 we let cool for a while before 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.400
 remove them from the molds but before 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.720
 let's cover them with a little sugar 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.940
 glas and also with a little cinnamon 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.640
 and we would have our cakes 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:04.130
 nativity scene ready to eat 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.740
 recent is when they know best though 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:09.140
 cold are not bad at all these 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.450
 typical portugal pastries are all 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:14.390
 a delight and a very original detail 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:16.519
 to give away in our house have been 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.650
 all a discovery and we make them 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.560
 whenever we can we hope that to 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:25.960
 you also like us see you in 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.960
