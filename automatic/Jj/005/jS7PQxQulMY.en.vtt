some<00:00:00.510> boats<00:00:00.810> of<00:00:00.960> the<00:00:00.989> time<00:00:01.199> at<00:00:01.380> dis<00:00:01.589> s<00:00:01.860> were

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
some boats of the time at dis s were

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.280 
some boats of the time at dis s were
saying<00:00:02.399> it's<00:00:02.550> a<00:00:02.580> nice<00:00:02.790> black<00:00:03.240> I<00:00:03.570> personally

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
saying it's a nice black I personally

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.079 
saying it's a nice black I personally
wouldn't<00:00:04.529> buy<00:00:04.770> it<00:00:04.799> because<00:00:05.460> if<00:00:05.850> I<00:00:05.910> was<00:00:06.000> gonna

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
wouldn't buy it because if I was gonna

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:07.430 
wouldn't buy it because if I was gonna
buy<00:00:06.240> this<00:00:06.299> black<00:00:06.839> I'd<00:00:07.020> probably<00:00:07.170> the

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
buy this black I'd probably the

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.459 
buy this black I'd probably the
specialized<00:00:08.099> diverged<00:00:08.790> which<00:00:09.179> is<00:00:09.300> a<00:00:09.330> real<00:00:09.599> you

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
specialized diverged which is a real you

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.200 
specialized diverged which is a real you
know<00:00:10.590> aggressive<00:00:10.889> so<00:00:11.429> this<00:00:11.610> field<00:00:11.820> was<00:00:11.940> good

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
know aggressive so this field was good

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.810 
know aggressive so this field was good
but<00:00:12.780> I<00:00:13.139> think<00:00:13.830> was<00:00:14.070> like<00:00:14.219> it<00:00:14.340> so<00:00:14.460> this<00:00:14.580> disc

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
but I think was like it so this disc

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.970 
but I think was like it so this disc
brakes<00:00:15.059> slapped<00:00:15.360> on<00:00:15.480> a<00:00:15.540> tarmac<00:00:15.859> but<00:00:16.859> the

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
brakes slapped on a tarmac but the

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.349 
brakes slapped on a tarmac but the
divers<00:00:17.340> just<00:00:17.699> there's<00:00:18.060> something<00:00:18.270> different

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
divers just there's something different

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:19.609 
divers just there's something different
going<00:00:18.570> on<00:00:18.720> there<00:00:18.900> that's<00:00:19.050> my<00:00:19.230> personal

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
going on there that's my personal

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:20.990 
going on there that's my personal
opinion<00:00:19.740> so<00:00:20.369> well<00:00:20.520> this<00:00:20.640> is<00:00:20.760> an<00:00:20.850> excellent

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
opinion so well this is an excellent

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.939 
opinion so well this is an excellent
bike<00:00:21.510> it's<00:00:21.750> not<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:21.869> bad<00:00:22.140> bike<00:00:22.410> if<00:00:22.710> I<00:00:22.769> was<00:00:22.859> gonna

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
bike it's not a bad bike if I was gonna

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.670 
bike it's not a bad bike if I was gonna
spend<00:00:23.310> their<00:00:23.460> cash<00:00:23.930> if<00:00:24.930> I<00:00:25.019> dropped<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.470> coin

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
spend their cash if I dropped the coin

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.130 
spend their cash if I dropped the coin
I've<00:00:26.340> got<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.609> coin<00:00:26.789> here<00:00:26.939> diverge<00:00:27.480> get<00:00:27.990> like

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
I've got the coin here diverge get like

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.070 
I've got the coin here diverge get like
a<00:00:28.170> you<00:00:28.320> know<00:00:28.439> big<00:00:28.710> tired<00:00:29.029> this<00:00:30.029> specific<00:00:30.900> sort

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
a you know big tired this specific sort

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.479 
a you know big tired this specific sort
of<00:00:31.109> blimey<00:00:31.439> obviously<00:00:31.769> is<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:31.890> dis<00:00:32.040> specific

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
of blimey obviously is a dis specific

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:33.979 
of blimey obviously is a dis specific
but<00:00:32.610> it<00:00:32.700> doesn't<00:00:32.940> I<00:00:33.180> can't<00:00:33.630> I<00:00:33.719> don't<00:00:33.870> really

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
but it doesn't I can't I don't really

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.959 
but it doesn't I can't I don't really
see<00:00:34.200> why<00:00:34.410> you'd<00:00:34.649> get<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:34.860> tarmac<00:00:35.520> despite

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
see why you'd get a tarmac despite

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.389 
see why you'd get a tarmac despite
personally<00:00:36.420> I'd<00:00:36.630> run<00:00:36.809> a<00:00:36.840> diverge<00:00:37.440> I<00:00:37.829> would

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
personally I'd run a diverge I would

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.549 
personally I'd run a diverge I would
have<00:00:38.489> larger<00:00:38.760> tires<00:00:38.969> better<00:00:39.719> gearing<00:00:40.170> from

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
have larger tires better gearing from

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.200 
have larger tires better gearing from
the<00:00:40.649> get-go<00:00:40.860> that's<00:00:41.610> my<00:00:41.790> personal<00:00:42.120> opinion

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
the get-go that's my personal opinion

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.240 
the get-go that's my personal opinion
it's<00:00:42.840> gonna<00:00:42.960> differ<00:00:43.200> but<00:00:43.559> it's<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.739> nice<00:00:43.890> bike

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
it's gonna differ but it's a nice bike

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.630 
it's gonna differ but it's a nice bike
it's<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.850> if<00:00:45.719> it<00:00:45.989> was<00:00:46.140> pretty<00:00:46.440> stiff<00:00:46.739> front<00:00:47.460> end

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
it's a if it was pretty stiff front end

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.100 
it's a if it was pretty stiff front end
it's<00:00:47.760> not<00:00:47.789> as<00:00:48.000> stiffer<00:00:48.239> this<00:00:48.390> is<00:00:48.480> a<00:00:48.510> TCR

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
it's not as stiffer this is a TCR

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.650 
it's not as stiffer this is a TCR
advanced<00:00:49.620> SL<00:00:49.950> 2012<00:00:50.550> onwards<00:00:50.700> they<00:00:51.270> lost<00:00:51.510> it

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
advanced SL 2012 onwards they lost it

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.240 
advanced SL 2012 onwards they lost it
from<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.840> front<00:00:52.020> end<00:00:52.079> like<00:00:52.199> more<00:00:52.350> power<00:00:52.590> when

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
from the front end like more power when

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.290 
from the front end like more power when
you're<00:00:53.340> sprinting<00:00:53.520> but<00:00:53.910> it's<00:00:54.030> still<00:00:54.120> good

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
you're sprinting but it's still good

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.389 
you're sprinting but it's still good
enough<00:00:54.329> it's<00:00:55.320> not<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.530> bad<00:00:55.800> bike<00:00:56.100> it's<00:00:56.340> a

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
enough it's not a bad bike it's a

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.430 
enough it's not a bad bike it's a
 excellent<00:00:56.940> bike<00:00:57.300> not<00:00:57.930> as<00:00:58.109> high

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
 excellent bike not as high

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.010 
 excellent bike not as high
performance<00:00:58.590> as<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.010> TCR<00:00:59.550> but<00:01:00.210> still<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.629> very

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
performance as a TCR but still a very

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.900 
performance as a TCR but still a very
very<00:01:01.289> excellent<00:01:01.770> bike<00:01:01.980> so<00:01:02.520> that's<00:01:02.640> my<00:01:02.730> basic

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
very excellent bike so that's my basic

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.320 
very excellent bike so that's my basic
review<00:01:03.239> this<00:01:03.390> s-works<00:01:04.199> tarmac<00:01:05.040> disc<00:01:05.580> great

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
review this s-works tarmac disc great

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.399

bike but if I was gonna spend the money
I'd<00:01:10.650> get<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.860> divers<00:01:11.220> instead<00:01:11.610> personally

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
I'd get the divers instead personally
