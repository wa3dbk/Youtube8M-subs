but basically i am bringing it down the

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.170 
but basically i am bringing it down the
side<00:04:14.329> of<00:04:14.359> my<00:04:14.709> cheekbone<00:04:15.709> not<00:04:16.159> too<00:04:16.489> far<00:04:16.909> because

that tends to make you look a little bit
more<00:04:20.829> costumey<00:04:21.829> i<00:04:22.039> think<00:04:22.280> the<00:04:22.370> word<00:04:22.400> would<00:04:22.669> be

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:22.729

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:25.510 
more costumey i think the word would be
and<00:04:23.060> then<00:04:24.020> make<00:04:24.380> sure<00:04:24.409> you<00:04:24.710> blend<00:04:24.949> upward

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520
