00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 the idea of ​​using some system to 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.509
 that man manipulates the rain is not 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.940
 new a few years ago a 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.889
 documentary of the bbc showed that the 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.990
 nasa had been working on a 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.420
 machine that is capable of creating clouds 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.490
 showing that man can already do 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.220
 causing clouds from the ground 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.590
 give off rain although the creation of 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.050
 clouds on the part of the nasa machine it 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.689
 must to the experiment with engines that are 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.970
 employees for NASA space missions 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.669
 use the machine to experiment with 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.190
 the engines and this caused the center 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.500
 of experiments was baptized as the 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.780
 machine to make clouds in the 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.940
 description of the video I leave the link 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.850
 of the video where the machine of the 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.160
 nasa in action creating clouds and doing 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.989
 to rain one of the machines 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.210
 experimental that is in the 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.149
 state of misisipí according to the bbc 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.340
 who had exclusive access to 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.649
 achieve some catch of the 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.079
 cloud-making machine makes a noise 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.820
 quite deep that even you 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.489
 warned the surrounding villagers 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.690
 that they had to leave the area since 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.670
 nothing would work 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.280
 the experiment of testing their engines 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.130
 space in a field of several acres 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.110
 the result was that most of the 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.300
 villagers had to abandon the 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.670
 area so that nothing could work 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.010
 due to the extreme noise that the machine 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.100
 baptized as a cloud creator causes 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:28.080
 in each of his tests every time 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.780
 experiments are made with the engines 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.030
 space the cloud machine is ejected 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.430
 a white cloud that after climbing 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.830
 until the sky makes hours later the 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.080
 rain descend to earth creating thus what 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.030
 that the creation of clouds was never thought 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.640
 for the man they are capable of doing 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.590
 descend rain the laser to be 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.050
 rain also has several purposes 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.390
 according to the teacher's words 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.090
 michio kaku who said to the cbs 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.160
 television that the goal of the laser is 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.190
 make rain on agricultural fields 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:01.470
 about places that suffer from droughts 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:04.050
 commercial purposes and for use 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.990
 military the last thing left to solve 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.970
 is if climate manipulation could 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.150
 affect the natural balance of 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.290
 planet on the other hand man will do 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.810
 that it rains through 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.269
 a laser system a laser could 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.819
 allow it to rain and manipulate the 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:22.769
 nature in areas suffering from drought on 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.109
 laser that is in development by 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:27.900
 some scientists from the university of 

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:30.689
 arizona and central florida colleges 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.819
 optics and photonics aims 

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:34.439
 point towards the clouds to make 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.650
 descend the rain on areas 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:39.540
 specific and in cities the report 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.299
 offered by nature photonics magazine 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.609
 He said that the laser is aimed at 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:47.129
 activate static energy in the clouds 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:49.049
 what would cause storms to be made 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:51.269
 in the place you want 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:52.980
 the student matthew mills said that the 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.930
 laser can be directed towards the 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.760
 objective when the laser hits 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.980
 would turn into electrons that 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.230
 they would go through oxygen and nitrogen 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.909
 that is in the clouds after 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.950
 keep explaining in terms 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:06.629
 experiment scientists others 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.549
 colleagues said they are still 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:11.400
 developing a cable that allows 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:13.799
 resist the collapse the idea is still in 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.810
 development process but has been so 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:18.359
 interesting that he has even woken up 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.980
 interest in government and it is expected that 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:22.019
 the technology called cloud 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.349
 make laser cloud receive a financing 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:27.269
 of at least 70 million dollars per 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:30.390
 part of the defense department of 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:32.549
 us so you can investigate more to 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.409
 background the experiment and man can 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:37.110
 have the control to manipulate the 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:40.650
 rain clouds created by man for 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:43.099
 what new greets you I figured until the 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.099
 next
