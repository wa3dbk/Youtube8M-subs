like this

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.210 
like this
and<00:01:23.840> then<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:25.500> just<00:01:26.630> feel<00:01:27.630> like<00:01:27.960> this<00:01:28.259> so<00:01:29.130> you

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
and then you just feel like this so you

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.249 
and then you just feel like this so you
have<00:01:29.280> enough<00:01:29.640> like<00:01:29.880> two<00:01:30.210> little<00:01:30.570> ponytails

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
have enough like two little ponytails

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.469 
have enough like two little ponytails
and<00:01:31.670> then<00:01:32.670> what<00:01:32.850> you're<00:01:32.970> going<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.119> do<00:01:33.240> is<00:01:33.329> was

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
and then what you're going to do is was

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.440 
and then what you're going to do is was
tied<00:01:33.750> up<00:01:34.310> so<00:01:35.310> for<00:01:35.490> me<00:01:35.640> you<00:01:35.820> can<00:01:36.000> actually<00:01:36.119> tie

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
tied up so for me you can actually tie

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.020 
tied up so for me you can actually tie
it<00:01:36.509> in<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.659> middle<00:01:37.439> or<00:01:37.650> you<00:01:37.710> can<00:01:37.920> tie<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.189> more

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
it in the middle or you can tie it more

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.120 
it in the middle or you can tie it more
on<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.390> sides<00:01:39.930> so<00:01:40.259> for<00:01:40.439> me<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:40.560> fell<00:01:40.979> at<00:01:41.070> the

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
on the sides so for me I fell at the

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.520 
on the sides so for me I fell at the
middle<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:41.880> what<00:01:42.869> you<00:01:42.960> do<00:01:43.110> is<00:01:43.170> just<00:01:43.200> do<00:01:43.470> a

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
middle and what you do is just do a

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.719 
middle and what you do is just do a
basic<00:01:43.829> knot<00:01:44.869> and<00:01:45.869> then<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:47.100> have<00:01:47.280> two<00:01:47.430> got<00:01:47.579> it

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
basic knot and then you have two got it

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.219 
basic knot and then you have two got it
again<00:01:47.970> in<00:01:48.869> order<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.200> secure<00:01:49.590> it<00:01:49.710> so<00:01:51.079> just<00:01:52.079> do

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
again in order to secure it so just do

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:58.490 
again in order to secure it so just do
two<00:01:52.590> knots<00:01:54.049> and<00:01:55.049> then<00:01:55.409> like<00:01:56.100> this<00:01:57.259> it's<00:01:58.259> all

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
two knots and then like this it's all

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.240 
two knots and then like this it's all
nicely<00:01:58.890> a<00:01:59.159> short<00:01:59.880> mini<00:02:00.360> dress<00:02:00.630> I<00:02:01.159> think<00:02:02.159> this

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
nicely a short mini dress I think this

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.639 
nicely a short mini dress I think this
is<00:02:02.399> actually<00:02:02.520> perfect<00:02:02.909> if<00:02:03.500> sometimes<00:02:04.500> you

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
is actually perfect if sometimes you

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.740 
is actually perfect if sometimes you
might<00:02:05.100> get<00:02:05.460> like<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.119> weather<00:02:06.299> might<00:02:06.570> get

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
might get like the weather might get

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.370 
might get like the weather might get
kind<00:02:06.990> of<00:02:07.140> former<00:02:07.770> so<00:02:08.459> I<00:02:08.700> think<00:02:08.819> this

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
kind of former so I think this

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.590 
kind of former so I think this

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
for that is a little bug that bad the

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.240 
for that is a little bug that bad the
back<00:02:18.080> part<00:02:18.410> you<00:02:18.500> see<00:02:18.680> how<00:02:18.860> you're<00:02:18.980> just<00:02:19.130> going

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250
