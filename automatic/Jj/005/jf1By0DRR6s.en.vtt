chickens<00:01:46.569> or<00:01:47.500> get<00:01:48.069> freshly<00:01:48.489> laid<00:01:48.640> eggs<00:01:48.849> no

00:01:49.169 --> 00:01:49.179 
chickens or get freshly laid eggs no

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:50.790 
chickens or get freshly laid eggs no
that's<00:01:49.479> very<00:01:49.660> difficult<00:01:49.959> to<00:01:50.349> peel<00:01:50.770> a

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:50.800 
that's very difficult to peel a

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.680 
that's very difficult to peel a
hard-boiled<00:01:50.979> egg<00:01:51.580> that's<00:01:51.849> been<00:01:51.940> freshly<00:01:52.300> laid

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
hard-boiled egg that's been freshly laid

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.169 
hard-boiled egg that's been freshly laid
the<00:01:53.590> wonderful<00:01:54.160> thing<00:01:54.280> about<00:01:54.459> cooking<00:01:54.759> in<00:01:55.090> the

00:01:55.169 --> 00:01:55.179 
the wonderful thing about cooking in the

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:56.609 
the wonderful thing about cooking in the
Sun<00:01:55.390> Oven<00:01:55.629> doing<00:01:55.899> hard-boiled<00:01:56.289> eggs<00:01:56.410> in<00:01:56.500> the

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
Sun Oven doing hard-boiled eggs in the

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:58.830 
Sun Oven doing hard-boiled eggs in the
Sun<00:01:56.800> Oven<00:01:56.979> without<00:01:57.280> the<00:01:57.429> water<00:01:57.640> is<00:01:57.940> that<00:01:57.970> the

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
Sun Oven without the water is that the

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.779 
Sun Oven without the water is that the
membrane<00:01:59.229> that<00:01:59.679> on<00:01:59.800> a<00:01:59.860> freshly<00:02:00.280> laid<00:02:00.580> egg

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 
membrane that on a freshly laid egg

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:02.820 
membrane that on a freshly laid egg
builds<00:02:01.270> up<00:02:01.420> between<00:02:01.599> the<00:02:01.899> egg<00:02:02.140> shell<00:02:02.500> and<00:02:02.739> the

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
builds up between the egg shell and the

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.160 
builds up between the egg shell and the
egg<00:02:02.950> white<00:02:03.250> completely<00:02:04.179> disappears<00:02:04.869> when

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
egg white completely disappears when

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.710 
egg white completely disappears when
it's<00:02:05.349> a<00:02:05.619> hard-boiled<00:02:06.340> in<00:02:06.700> the<00:02:06.819> Sun<00:02:07.030> Oven<00:02:07.270> so

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
it's a hard-boiled in the Sun Oven so

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.719 
it's a hard-boiled in the Sun Oven so
it's<00:02:07.869> very<00:02:08.020> easy<00:02:08.170> to<00:02:08.679> peel<00:02:08.950> so<00:02:09.369> there<00:02:09.489> are

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
it's very easy to peel so there are

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.339 
it's very easy to peel so there are
advantages<00:02:09.879> particularly<00:02:10.629> especially<00:02:10.899> laid

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 
advantages particularly especially laid

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:13.440 
advantages particularly especially laid
eggs<00:02:11.560> to<00:02:11.890> doing<00:02:12.489> them<00:02:12.610> in<00:02:12.700> the<00:02:12.760> Sun<00:02:12.970> Oven<00:02:13.150> but

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
eggs to doing them in the Sun Oven but

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.479 
eggs to doing them in the Sun Oven but
the<00:02:13.810> leveling<00:02:14.260> tray<00:02:14.500> will<00:02:14.739> accommodate<00:02:15.280> two

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
the leveling tray will accommodate two

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:18.240 
the leveling tray will accommodate two
dozen<00:02:15.849> eggs<00:02:16.060> and<00:02:16.540> I<00:02:16.780> preheated<00:02:17.379> the<00:02:17.680> oven<00:02:17.800> it's

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
dozen eggs and I preheated the oven it's

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.339 
dozen eggs and I preheated the oven it's
a<00:02:18.400> late<00:02:18.610> September<00:02:19.180> day<00:02:19.360> it's<00:02:19.629> partly<00:02:20.050> cloudy

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 
a late September day it's partly cloudy

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:22.979 
a late September day it's partly cloudy
so<00:02:20.800> today<00:02:21.069> we<00:02:21.220> don't<00:02:21.370> have<00:02:21.640> full<00:02:21.970> Sun<00:02:22.269> we<00:02:22.900> have

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
so today we don't have full Sun we have

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:24.210 
so today we don't have full Sun we have
a<00:02:23.019> temperature<00:02:23.379> I<00:02:23.530> think<00:02:23.739> the<00:02:23.830> maximum

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
a temperature I think the maximum

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.170 
a temperature I think the maximum
temperature<00:02:24.400> probably<00:02:24.879> going<00:02:25.000> to<00:02:25.060> reach

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
temperature probably going to reach

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.540 
temperature probably going to reach
today<00:02:25.390> is<00:02:25.720> probably<00:02:26.050> between<00:02:26.230> 290<00:02:27.190> and<00:02:27.310> 300

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
today is probably between 290 and 300

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.670 
today is probably between 290 and 300
degrees<00:02:27.700> Fahrenheit<00:02:28.450> but<00:02:28.660> we<00:02:29.170> can<00:02:29.320> cook<00:02:29.500> the

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
degrees Fahrenheit but we can cook the

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.520 
degrees Fahrenheit but we can cook the
eggs<00:02:29.860> normally

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
eggs normally

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.250 
eggs normally
I can<00:02:30.770> cook<00:02:31.420> two<00:02:32.420> dozen<00:02:32.720> eggs<00:02:32.870> in<00:02:32.990> about<00:02:33.170> an

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
I can cook two dozen eggs in about an

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.199 
I can cook two dozen eggs in about an
hour<00:02:33.350> and<00:02:33.620> ten<00:02:33.800> minutes<00:02:33.830> today<00:02:34.520> I<00:02:34.550> suspect

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
hour and ten minutes today I suspect

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.270 
hour and ten minutes today I suspect
with<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:35.540> lower<00:02:35.959> temperature<00:02:36.560> it's<00:02:37.040> going<00:02:37.220> to

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
with the lower temperature it's going to

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.250 
with the lower temperature it's going to
take<00:02:37.459> approximately<00:02:37.819> an<00:02:38.300> hour<00:02:38.390> and<00:02:38.630> a<00:02:38.660> half<00:02:38.870> so

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
take approximately an hour and a half so

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.290 
take approximately an hour and a half so
all<00:02:39.680> I<00:02:39.740> did<00:02:39.950> was<00:02:40.250> cut<00:02:40.430> the<00:02:40.550> lids<00:02:40.760> off<00:02:41.000> the<00:02:41.209> egg

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
all I did was cut the lids off the egg

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.110 
all I did was cut the lids off the egg
carton<00:02:41.540> now<00:02:42.319> open<00:02:42.770> the<00:02:42.920> preheated<00:02:43.580> Sun<00:02:43.819> Oven

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
carton now open the preheated Sun Oven

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:54.430 
carton now open the preheated Sun Oven
and<00:02:44.330> I<00:02:45.080> will<00:02:45.440> put<00:02:46.190> the<00:02:46.310> eggs<00:02:46.520> in<00:02:53.290> sometimes<00:02:54.290> you

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
and I will put the eggs in sometimes you

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.440 
and I will put the eggs in sometimes you
got<00:02:54.560> to<00:02:54.680> balance<00:02:55.550> them<00:02:55.880> a<00:02:55.940> little<00:02:56.120> bit<00:02:56.239> while

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
got to balance them a little bit while

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:05.600 
got to balance them a little bit while
you're<00:02:56.569> getting<00:02:56.720> them<00:02:56.959> in

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.390 

so<00:03:06.120> now<00:03:06.240> the<00:03:06.360> two<00:03:06.540> dozen<00:03:06.750> eggs<00:03:06.900> are<00:03:07.140> there

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
so now the two dozen eggs are there

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.130 
so now the two dozen eggs are there
we'll<00:03:08.400> shut<00:03:08.610> the<00:03:08.730> door<00:03:08.910> here<00:03:09.270> we'll<00:03:09.750> set<00:03:09.960> this

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
we'll shut the door here we'll set this

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.600 
we'll shut the door here we'll set this
in<00:03:10.350> the<00:03:10.380> Sun<00:03:10.680> we'll<00:03:10.920> come<00:03:11.130> back

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
in the Sun we'll come back

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.700 
in the Sun we'll come back
probably<00:03:12.300> an<00:03:12.420> hour<00:03:12.570> and<00:03:12.840> a<00:03:12.870> half<00:03:13.020> or<00:03:13.200> so<00:03:13.380> and

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:13.710 
probably an hour and a half or so and

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:20.900 
probably an hour and a half or so and
see<00:03:14.100> how<00:03:14.250> the<00:03:14.310> Sun<00:03:14.640> is<00:03:14.670> doing<00:03:19.580> well<00:03:20.580> it's<00:03:20.730> been

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
see how the Sun is doing well it's been

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.150 
see how the Sun is doing well it's been
about<00:03:21.090> an<00:03:21.300> hour<00:03:21.420> and<00:03:21.690> a<00:03:21.720> half<00:03:21.930> the<00:03:22.590> sun's<00:03:22.860> kind

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
about an hour and a half the sun's kind

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.130 
about an hour and a half the sun's kind
of<00:03:23.250> playing<00:03:23.490> hide-and-seek<00:03:24.150> today<00:03:24.540> so<00:03:24.690> it's

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
of playing hide-and-seek today so it's

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.960 
of playing hide-and-seek today so it's
been<00:03:25.290> coming<00:03:25.530> and<00:03:25.740> going<00:03:25.800> but<00:03:26.580> let's<00:03:26.760> take<00:03:26.910> a

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
been coming and going but let's take a

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.510 
been coming and going but let's take a
look<00:03:27.180> and<00:03:27.360> see<00:03:27.660> how<00:03:27.870> the<00:03:27.930> eggs<00:03:28.200> are<00:03:28.380> doing<00:03:28.710> it's

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.520 
look and see how the eggs are doing it's

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.010 
look and see how the eggs are doing it's
hard<00:03:29.910> to<00:03:30.030> tell<00:03:30.240> by<00:03:30.390> looking<00:03:30.720> at<00:03:30.780> an<00:03:30.900> egg

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
hard to tell by looking at an egg

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.840 
hard to tell by looking at an egg
whether<00:03:31.290> it's<00:03:31.500> hard-boiled<00:03:32.010> or<00:03:32.130> not<00:03:32.370> but<00:03:32.730> what

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
whether it's hard-boiled or not but what

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.340 
whether it's hard-boiled or not but what
you<00:03:32.970> can<00:03:33.210> do<00:03:33.480> is<00:03:33.690> we're<00:03:33.840> going<00:03:33.930> to<00:03:33.990> open<00:03:34.050> this

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
you can do is we're going to open this

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.350 
you can do is we're going to open this
up<00:03:34.560> we're<00:03:35.250> just<00:03:35.280> going<00:03:35.550> to<00:03:35.580> take<00:03:35.760> one<00:03:36.090> of<00:03:36.120> the

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
up we're just going to take one of the

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.880 
up we're just going to take one of the
eggs<00:03:36.540> out<00:03:36.930> of<00:03:36.960> the<00:03:37.260> other<00:03:38.240> using<00:03:39.240> a<00:03:39.560> hot<00:03:40.560> pad

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
eggs out of the other using a hot pad

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.000 
eggs out of the other using a hot pad

what<00:03:44.670> you<00:03:44.820> did<00:03:45.030> the<00:03:45.150> way<00:03:45.270> you<00:03:45.330> can<00:03:45.540> tell<00:03:45.750> if<00:03:45.930> an

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
what you did the way you can tell if an

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:47.540 
what you did the way you can tell if an
egg<00:03:46.170> is<00:03:46.200> done<00:03:46.350> if<00:03:46.740> you<00:03:46.830> just<00:03:46.980> set<00:03:47.220> it<00:03:47.340> on<00:03:47.430> a<00:03:47.459> flat

egg is done if you just set it on a flat

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:51.250 
egg is done if you just set it on a flat
surface<00:03:48.150> like<00:03:48.570> this<00:03:48.780> table<00:03:49.050> and<00:03:49.820> you<00:03:50.820> spin<00:03:51.209> it

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
surface like this table and you spin it

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.900 
surface like this table and you spin it
see<00:03:52.260> it<00:03:52.350> spins<00:03:52.740> nicely<00:03:52.890> it's<00:03:53.430> not<00:03:53.610> wobbling

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
see it spins nicely it's not wobbling

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.180 
see it spins nicely it's not wobbling
around<00:03:54.480> which<00:03:54.810> means<00:03:55.020> that<00:03:55.350> this<00:03:55.560> egg<00:03:55.770> is<00:03:55.980> done

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
around which means that this egg is done

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.550 
around which means that this egg is done
so<00:03:56.730> then<00:03:57.240> we<00:03:57.420> can<00:03:57.540> take<00:03:57.660> the<00:03:57.810> rest<00:03:58.020> out<00:03:58.230> and

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
so then we can take the rest out and

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:04.490 
so then we can take the rest out and
they'll<00:03:58.740> be<00:03:58.920> ready<00:03:59.160> to<00:03:59.310> eat<00:04:03.140> well<00:04:04.140> let's<00:04:04.320> see
