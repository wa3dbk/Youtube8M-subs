confident the sauce ugh I knew in the
world<00:02:01.259> with<00:02:01.409> him<00:02:02.000> he's<00:02:03.000> raced<00:02:03.210> against<00:02:03.570> I<00:02:03.659> was

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
world with him he's raced against I was

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.830 
world with him he's raced against I was
also<00:02:03.869> before<00:02:05.000> basically<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.060> same<00:02:06.240> field<00:02:06.540> and

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
also before basically the same field and

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.139 
also before basically the same field and
I<00:02:07.710> think<00:02:08.129> with<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.280> white<00:02:08.429> with<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:08.879> white

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
I think with the white with the white

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.350 
I think with the white with the white
difference

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
difference

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.980 
difference
you'll<00:02:10.570> be<00:02:10.810> I'm<00:02:11.430> very<00:02:12.430> confident<00:02:12.880> Felix<00:02:13.780> could

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
you'll be I'm very confident Felix could

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.170 
you'll be I'm very confident Felix could
see<00:02:14.170> I<00:02:14.380> gave<00:02:14.620> it<00:02:14.710> a<00:02:14.770> beautiful<00:02:14.950> ride<00:02:15.220> great

see I gave it a beautiful ride great
ride<00:02:16.420> I<00:02:16.780> think<00:02:17.260> he<00:02:17.410> rode<00:02:17.860> him<00:02:18.010> to<00:02:18.490> suit<00:02:18.700> doors

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
ride I think he rode him to suit doors

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.710 
ride I think he rode him to suit doors
and<00:02:20.580> many<00:02:21.580> to<00:02:21.760> get<00:02:21.880> a<00:02:21.970> cover<00:02:22.150> on<00:02:22.270> the<00:02:22.540> tune

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
and many to get a cover on the tune

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.360 
and many to get a cover on the tune
which<00:02:22.900> the<00:02:23.410> whole<00:02:23.500> morning<00:02:23.710> he<00:02:23.920> said<00:02:23.950> to<00:02:24.220> me<00:02:24.310> is

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
which the whole morning he said to me is

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.820 
which the whole morning he said to me is
going<00:02:24.520> to<00:02:24.610> try<00:02:24.760> and<00:02:24.790> get<00:02:25.060> our<00:02:25.780> the<00:02:25.900> eroding<00:02:26.350> to

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
going to try and get our the eroding to

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.110 
going to try and get our the eroding to
show<00:02:27.040> him<00:02:27.160> the<00:02:27.250> course<00:02:27.460> more<00:02:27.700> than<00:02:27.880> anything

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
show him the course more than anything

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.610 
show him the course more than anything
and<00:02:28.480> I<00:02:28.710> think<00:02:29.710> what<00:02:30.210> physics<00:02:31.210> a<00:02:31.330> bit<00:02:31.620> surprised

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
and I think what physics a bit surprised

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.440 
and I think what physics a bit surprised
as<00:02:32.800> well<00:02:32.920> because<00:02:33.280> I<00:02:33.610> think<00:02:33.790> Felix<00:02:34.150> lauded

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
as well because I think Felix lauded

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.570 
as well because I think Felix lauded
quicken<00:02:34.840> lot<00:02:35.110> quicker<00:02:35.440> but<00:02:36.070> I<00:02:36.130> think<00:02:36.400> been

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
quicken lot quicker but I think been

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.990 
quicken lot quicker but I think been
with<00:02:36.820> a<00:02:36.850> greenness<00:02:37.800> Felix<00:02:38.800> had<00:02:39.490> to<00:02:39.520> shake<00:02:39.820> him

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
with a greenness Felix had to shake him

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.510 
with a greenness Felix had to shake him
up<00:02:40.090> a<00:02:40.240> bit<00:02:40.270> and<00:02:40.600> for<00:02:41.500> Fred<00:02:41.680> crappy<00:02:41.950> idea<00:02:42.130> you
