we<00:00:06.950> want<00:00:07.069> to<00:00:07.160> catch<00:00:07.279> the<00:00:07.430> water

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:09.220 
we want to catch the water

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:13.760 
we want to catch the water
because<00:00:09.370> well<00:00:09.580> I<00:00:10.530> don't<00:00:11.530> want<00:00:11.650> the<00:00:12.000> order

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:13.770 
because well I don't want the order

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.100 
because well I don't want the order

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:17.720 
late as it is on that tip so I'm blowing

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.279 
late as it is on that tip so I'm blowing
it<00:00:17.840> off<00:00:18.020> slightly<00:00:18.400> just<00:00:19.400> pale<00:00:19.760> blue<00:00:20.119> and<00:00:20.300> then

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:21.289 
it off slightly just pale blue and then

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:26.380 
it off slightly just pale blue and then
darting<00:00:21.710> it<00:00:21.860> down<00:00:23.410> further<00:00:24.410> I<00:00:24.880> get<00:00:25.880> him<00:00:26.210> behind

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
darting it down further I get him behind

darting it down further I get him behind
the<00:00:26.660> rock<00:00:33.100> don't<00:00:34.100> worry<00:00:34.280> if<00:00:34.370> you<00:00:34.460> mix<00:00:34.700> the<00:00:35.739> rock

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
the rock don't worry if you mix the rock

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:46.180 
the rock don't worry if you mix the rock
color<00:00:36.980> with<00:00:37.250> the<00:00:37.690> water<00:00:38.690> too<00:00:38.960> much<00:00:45.070> that<00:00:46.070> would

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
color with the water too much that would

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:53.850 
color with the water too much that would
naturally<00:00:46.430> occur<00:00:51.790> and<00:00:52.790> give<00:00:53.000> this<00:00:53.120> more<00:00:53.360> shape

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:53.860 
naturally occur and give this more shape

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:59.770 
naturally occur and give this more shape
bring<00:00:54.860> this<00:00:54.980> up<00:00:55.190> further<00:00:58.390> it<00:00:59.390> stands<00:00:59.660> to

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
bring this up further it stands to

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.510 
bring this up further it stands to
reason<00:00:59.930> if<00:01:00.170> it's<00:01:00.500> that<00:01:00.680> high<00:01:00.860> over<00:01:01.160> that<00:01:01.310> size

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520 
reason if it's that high over that size

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.580 
reason if it's that high over that size
that<00:01:01.760> it<00:01:02.180> wouldn't<00:01:02.510> be<00:01:02.630> flat<00:01:02.930> over<00:01:03.230> this<00:01:03.380> side

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:03.590 
that it wouldn't be flat over this side

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:11.900 
that it wouldn't be flat over this side
but<00:01:03.739> just<00:01:04.250> bring<00:01:04.489> it<00:01:04.640> up<00:01:04.759> just<00:01:04.790> a<00:01:05.119> touch<00:01:05.360> more

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:11.910 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:17.840 

but<00:01:12.910> we<00:01:13.030> bring<00:01:13.360> this<00:01:13.540> rock<00:01:14.100> further<00:01:15.100> down<00:01:15.370> and

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.580 

add<00:01:18.850> a<00:01:18.880> bit<00:01:19.090> more<00:01:19.300> interest<00:01:19.630> or<00:01:20.190> we<00:01:21.190> could<00:01:22.590> even

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
add a bit more interest or we could even

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.760 
add a bit more interest or we could even
have<00:01:24.460> the<00:01:24.640> semblance<00:01:24.880> of<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:26.380> bit<00:01:26.560> of<00:01:26.590> each

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
have the semblance of a bit of each

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.290 
have the semblance of a bit of each
there<00:01:29.160> so<00:01:30.160> into<00:01:30.400> the<00:01:30.490> rock<00:01:30.640> color<00:01:30.880> I've<00:01:31.090> just

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:31.300 
there so into the rock color I've just

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.870 
there so into the rock color I've just
mixed<00:01:31.570> in<00:01:31.690> a<00:01:31.720> little<00:01:32.050> bit<00:01:32.170> of<00:01:32.260> the<00:01:32.410> yellow

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
mixed in a little bit of the yellow

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:54.380 
mixed in a little bit of the yellow
ochre<00:01:37.140> that's<00:01:38.140> not<00:01:38.350> enough<00:01:39.060> touch<00:01:40.060> more

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.850 

now<00:01:55.390> I<00:01:55.420> can<00:01:55.570> work<00:01:55.750> away<00:01:55.899> with<00:01:56.200> the<00:01:56.289> water<00:01:56.409> again

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
now I can work away with the water again

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.649 
now I can work away with the water again
a<00:01:57.539> bit<00:01:58.539> more<00:01:58.570> detailing<00:01:59.170> into<00:01:59.590> that<00:02:00.570> it<00:02:01.570> would

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
a bit more detailing into that it would

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:15.780 
a bit more detailing into that it would
come<00:02:01.840> up<00:02:01.990> to<00:02:02.289> dark<00:02:04.170> further<00:02:05.170> there

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.240 

texture<00:02:16.790> this<00:02:16.970> water<00:02:17.270> of<00:02:17.450> it<00:02:17.830> was<00:02:18.830> catching

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
texture this water of it was catching

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:39.199 
texture this water of it was catching
the<00:02:19.370> light

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.459 

as<00:02:46.920> a<00:02:46.980> thundering<00:02:47.640> in<00:02:47.959> will<00:02:48.959> give<00:02:49.109> that<00:02:49.260> more

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:15.610 
around its pace very often with the rock
on<00:03:13.260> the<00:03:13.290> beach<00:03:13.500> you'll<00:03:14.010> get<00:03:14.189> a<00:03:14.220> pool<00:03:14.519> of<00:03:14.760> water

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620
