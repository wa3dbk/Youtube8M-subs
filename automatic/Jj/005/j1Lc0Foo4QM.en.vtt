00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.189
 how to draw a skeleton 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:09.999
 of human bodies 

00:00:09.999 --> 00:00:12.109
 we saw that it was necessary 

00:00:12.109 --> 00:00:15.109
 the eight equal parties 

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:19.389
 to make the body structure the basic elements 

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:23.480
 the head 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.699
 that we will see 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:26.529
 later on 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:28.029
 proportions 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:31.029
 the pot 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.140
 along the midline 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.820
 the little things that are pretty much 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.760
 symmetrical 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.770
 on the second box that is dedicated 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.770
 at the shoulders we draw a perpendicular line 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.420
 for the structure of the shoulder 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.410
 six others both boxes 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.500
 my transfer roughly the shape of the ribs and discovers 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.950
 there is the spine the navel here we saw on the line 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.220
 of the third box 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.450
 we had drawn the diagonals to fix 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.770
 the width of the shoulder relative to the width of the patient 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.140
 Yes, but 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.340
 the femurs 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.360
 school but femur 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.470
 the pelvis being roughly 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.030
 a heart 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.050
 and then at the level of others the fifth and the sixth symposium there 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.680
 to the youngsters 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.600
 contrast 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.520
 femurs to the knees 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.070
 There is here 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.180
 the kneecaps 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.300
 penultimate case being the tibia which extends with the ankles 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.600
 but the foot 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.600
 symmetrically at the level of the arms 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.210
 until the popcorn shine afp you have 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:50.830
 the arm 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.270
 up to the head of the femur you have the forearms 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.890
 and the hand that takes 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:56.740
 a 2015
