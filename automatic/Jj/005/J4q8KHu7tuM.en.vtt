I'm deciding now that if I ever get I
think<00:04:24.590> 10<00:04:24.980> or<00:04:25.100> 11<00:04:25.460> on<00:04:25.610> each<00:04:25.940> one<00:04:26.240> i<00:04:26.530> get<00:04:27.530> 10<00:04:27.830> 11

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:28.640 
think 10 or 11 on each one i get 10 11

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.120 
think 10 or 11 on each one i get 10 11
or<00:04:28.790> more<00:04:29.390> on<00:04:29.660> every<00:04:30.080> single<00:04:30.410> one<00:04:30.560> I'm<00:04:30.770> just<00:04:31.070> a

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
or more on every single one I'm just a

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.760 
or more on every single one I'm just a
fan<00:04:31.340> shop<00:04:31.580> I<00:04:32.290> don't<00:04:33.290> know<00:04:33.350> how<00:04:33.440> much<00:04:33.530> i<00:04:33.590> make

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
fan shop I don't know how much i make

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.020 
fan shop I don't know how much i make
about<00:04:34.030> 12<00:04:35.030> mil<00:04:35.210> like<00:04:35.870> maybe<00:04:36.080> more<00:04:36.350> profit<00:04:37.310> so<00:04:38.000> I

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
about 12 mil like maybe more profit so I

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.810 
about 12 mil like maybe more profit so I
think<00:04:38.120> that's<00:04:38.360> pretty<00:04:39.020> good<00:04:39.320> for<00:04:39.680> your<00:04:40.640> first

time<00:04:41.150> and<00:04:41.600> that
