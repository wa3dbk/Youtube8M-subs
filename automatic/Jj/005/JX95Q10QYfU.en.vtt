Walter Mangler who back in 1960s 1970s
was<00:03:19.780> very<00:03:20.380> influential<00:03:21.330> 1976<00:03:22.330> all<00:03:22.870> the<00:03:23.260> way<00:03:23.350> to

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
was very influential 1976 all the way to

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.680 
was very influential 1976 all the way to
2008<00:03:24.280> we<00:03:24.910> had<00:03:25.090> F<00:03:25.950> 1.0<00:03:26.950> which<00:03:27.940> was<00:03:28.150> very<00:03:28.360> good

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
2008 we had F 1.0 which was very good

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.250 
2008 we had F 1.0 which was very good
and<00:03:28.930> this<00:03:29.200> lens<00:03:29.530> is<00:03:29.920> an<00:03:30.430> improvement<00:03:30.850> at<00:03:31.260> 0.95

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
and this lens is an improvement at 0.95

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.390 
and this lens is an improvement at 0.95
which<00:03:33.010> improves<00:03:33.700> the<00:03:34.090> light<00:03:34.330> capability<00:03:35.110> by

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
which improves the light capability by

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.130 
which improves the light capability by
11%<00:03:36.400> which<00:03:36.459> is<00:03:36.640> astounding<00:03:37.180> going<00:03:38.080> to

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
11% which is astounding going to

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.370 
11% which is astounding going to
consider<00:03:38.590> that<00:03:38.860> this<00:03:39.010> is<00:03:39.070> 1.0<00:03:39.970> so<00:03:40.780> technically

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
consider that this is 1.0 so technically

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.720 
consider that this is 1.0 so technically
speaking<00:03:42.450> this<00:03:43.450> is<00:03:43.870> one<00:03:44.709> of<00:03:44.739> the<00:03:45.010> best<00:03:45.250> lenses

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
speaking this is one of the best lenses

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.720 
speaking this is one of the best lenses
in<00:03:45.910> the<00:03:46.000> world<00:03:46.230> now<00:03:47.230> this<00:03:47.440> lens<00:03:47.709> as<00:03:48.310> you<00:03:48.549> can

in the world now this lens as you can

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.600 
in the world now this lens as you can
see<00:03:48.940> comes<00:03:49.299> packaged<00:03:49.690> like<00:03:49.900> this<00:03:49.930> and<00:03:50.530> when<00:03:51.489> we

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
see comes packaged like this and when we

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:57.470 
see comes packaged like this and when we
open<00:03:51.940> it<00:03:53.940> you<00:03:54.940> have<00:03:55.360> this<00:03:55.600> now<00:03:56.019> like<00:03:56.410> nothing

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:45.640 
elements in it if you look at it there

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.010 
elements in it if you look at it there
are<00:04:45.670> eight<00:04:45.880> elements<00:04:46.270> in<00:04:46.870> five<00:04:47.230> groups<00:04:47.430> okay

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
are eight elements in five groups okay

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.630 
are eight elements in five groups okay
that's<00:04:50.020> the<00:04:50.260> lens<00:04:50.440> as<00:04:50.890> you<00:04:51.190> can<00:04:51.340> see<00:04:51.520> the

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:51.640 
that's the lens as you can see the

defects<00:05:02.200> which<00:05:02.500> is<00:05:02.680> very<00:05:02.920> important<00:05:03.400> because

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.550 
defects which is very important because

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.060 
defects which is very important because
when<00:05:03.820> you<00:05:03.940> go<00:05:03.970> to<00:05:04.120> this<00:05:04.420> size<00:05:04.720> you<00:05:05.530> don't<00:05:05.830> want

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.070 
when you go to this size you don't want

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:09.030 
when you go to this size you don't want
have<00:05:06.340> color<00:05:06.640> defects<00:05:07.210> and<00:05:07.450> then<00:05:08.320> secondly

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:09.040 
have color defects and then secondly

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.550 
have color defects and then secondly
which<00:05:09.460> is<00:05:09.610> more<00:05:09.790> importantly<00:05:10.360> you<00:05:11.050> have<00:05:11.170> three

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
which is more importantly you have three

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.650 
which is more importantly you have three
lenses<00:05:12.100> which<00:05:12.490> are<00:05:12.670> highly<00:05:12.970> reflective<00:05:13.120> or

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:13.660 
lenses which are highly reflective or

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.680 
lenses which are highly reflective or
controlling<00:05:14.200> distortion<00:05:15.160> and<00:05:15.370> a<00:05:16.120> spherical

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690 
controlling distortion and a spherical

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:17.700 
controlling distortion and a spherical
aberrations

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
aberrations

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.680 
aberrations
there<00:05:18.130> are<00:05:18.190> truth<00:05:18.430> read<00:05:18.820> floating<00:05:19.270> elements

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.690 
there are truth read floating elements

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:21.570 
there are truth read floating elements
which<00:05:19.810> improves<00:05:20.320> the<00:05:20.440> close-up<00:05:20.890> performance

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:21.580 
which improves the close-up performance

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.780 
which improves the close-up performance
okay<00:05:22.360> and<00:05:22.570> there<00:05:23.260> are<00:05:23.350> two<00:05:23.560> other<00:05:23.800> important

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:24.790 
okay and there are two other important

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:26.880 
okay and there are two other important
elements<00:05:25.330> in<00:05:25.450> this<00:05:25.630> which<00:05:25.870> are<00:05:26.020> spherical

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:26.890 
elements in this which are spherical

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:30.930 
elements in this which are spherical
surfaces<00:05:27.850> which<00:05:28.510> reduce<00:05:29.440> any<00:05:30.340> of<00:05:30.760> the

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:30.940 
surfaces which reduce any of the

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.270 
surfaces which reduce any of the
distortion<00:05:31.690> as<00:05:32.050> much<00:05:32.350> as<00:05:32.470> possible

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 
distortion as much as possible

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.200 
distortion as much as possible
now<00:05:33.970> as<00:05:34.870> you<00:05:35.800> open<00:05:36.190> the<00:05:36.220> back<00:05:36.520> you<00:05:36.790> will<00:05:36.940> see

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.210 
now as you open the back you will see

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.140 
now as you open the back you will see
the<00:05:37.540> coding<00:05:38.110> six<00:05:38.860> bit<00:05:39.130> coding<00:05:39.610> which<00:05:39.760> is<00:05:39.940> very

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.150 
the coding six bit coding which is very

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.000 
the coding six bit coding which is very
important<00:05:40.690> for<00:05:40.870> the<00:05:40.990> new<00:05:41.260> cameras<00:05:41.770> it

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.010 
important for the new cameras it

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:45.210 
important for the new cameras it
transfers<00:05:42.640> of<00:05:42.820> metadata<00:05:43.590> into<00:05:44.590> the<00:05:44.680> cameras

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:45.220 
transfers of metadata into the cameras

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.690 
transfers of metadata into the cameras
and<00:05:45.540> letting<00:05:46.540> the<00:05:46.690> camera<00:05:47.520> communicate<00:05:48.520> with

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:48.700 
and letting the camera communicate with

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.480 
and letting the camera communicate with
the<00:05:48.820> lens<00:05:49.030> saying<00:05:49.990> that<00:05:50.710> it's<00:05:50.980> a<00:05:51.130> 50

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:51.490 
the lens saying that it's a 50
