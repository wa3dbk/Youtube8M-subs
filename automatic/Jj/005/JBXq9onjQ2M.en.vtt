today I'm going to show you how to seal
up<00:00:10.650> an<00:00:11.460> opening<00:00:12.060> that<00:00:12.210> might<00:00:12.390> have<00:00:12.510> been<00:00:12.570> left

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
up an opening that might have been left

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.480 
up an opening that might have been left
by<00:00:13.020> the<00:00:13.080> Builder<00:00:13.560> might<00:00:13.920> be<00:00:14.040> around<00:00:14.190> a<00:00:14.310> pipe

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
by the Builder might be around a pipe

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.490 
by the Builder might be around a pipe
entry<00:00:14.850> point<00:00:15.090> on<00:00:15.420> this<00:00:15.810> particular<00:00:16.080> point

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
entry point on this particular point

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.250 
entry point on this particular point
it's<00:00:16.740> a<00:00:16.830> transition<00:00:17.520> between<00:00:17.610> the<00:00:18.260> concrete

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
it's a transition between the concrete

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.730 
it's a transition between the concrete
port<00:00:19.740> wall<00:00:19.980> and<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:21.210> stud<00:00:21.510> wall<00:00:22.260> that<00:00:22.560> was

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
port wall and the stud wall that was

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.260 
port wall and the stud wall that was
installed<00:00:23.369> when<00:00:23.700> the<00:00:23.760> house<00:00:23.939> was<00:00:24.150> originally

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:24.270 
installed when the house was originally

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.780 
installed when the house was originally
built<00:00:24.630> now<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.650> Builder<00:00:26.100> had<00:00:26.280> originally

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:26.790 
built now the Builder had originally

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.410 
built now the Builder had originally
just<00:00:27.450> stuffed<00:00:27.870> in<00:00:28.080> some<00:00:28.460> pink<00:00:29.460> insulation<00:00:30.180> and

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
just stuffed in some pink insulation and

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.100 
just stuffed in some pink insulation and
you<00:00:30.660> know<00:00:31.250> tell<00:00:32.250> you<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.400> truth<00:00:32.700> a<00:00:33.080> gap<00:00:34.080> that

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
you know tell you the truth a gap that

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.740 
you know tell you the truth a gap that
wide<00:00:34.670> this<00:00:35.670> just<00:00:35.970> isn't<00:00:36.120> going<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.330> keep<00:00:36.540> out

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
wide this just isn't going to keep out

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.170 
wide this just isn't going to keep out
bugs<00:00:36.860> it's<00:00:37.860> not<00:00:38.100> going<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.309> keep<00:00:38.489> out<00:00:38.699> rodents

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
bugs it's not going to keep out rodents

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.869 
bugs it's not going to keep out rodents
so<00:00:40.020> we<00:00:40.110> just<00:00:40.260> throw<00:00:40.409> that<00:00:40.559> away<00:00:40.710> that's<00:00:41.699> why<00:00:41.850> I

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
so we just throw that away that's why I

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.869 
so we just throw that away that's why I
show<00:00:42.150> you<00:00:42.210> just<00:00:42.540> just<00:00:43.230> how<00:00:44.150> how<00:00:45.150> poorly<00:00:45.600> I<00:00:46.879> mean

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
show you just just how how poorly I mean

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.399 
show you just just how how poorly I mean
the<00:00:47.970> air<00:00:48.180> is<00:00:48.420> just<00:00:48.570> blowing<00:00:49.019> through<00:00:49.050> there

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:49.409 
the air is just blowing through there

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:53.689 
the air is just blowing through there
and<00:00:50.129> at<00:00:50.580> every<00:00:50.820> point<00:00:52.190> if<00:00:53.190> you<00:00:53.309> could<00:00:53.460> feel<00:00:53.640> it

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
and at every point if you could feel it

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.040 
and at every point if you could feel it
it's<00:00:53.940> almost<00:00:54.089> like<00:00:54.330> an<00:00:54.449> air<00:00:54.570> conditioning

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
it's almost like an air conditioning

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.110 
it's almost like an air conditioning
vent<00:00:55.260> I<00:00:55.379> mean<00:00:55.500> it's<00:00:55.650> just<00:00:55.729> it's<00:00:56.729> just<00:00:56.790> really

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
vent I mean it's just it's just really

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.759 
vent I mean it's just it's just really
coming<00:00:57.330> through<00:00:57.600> there<00:00:57.780> yeah<00:00:58.440> that's<00:00:58.589> not

00:00:58.759 --> 00:00:58.769 
coming through there yeah that's not

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:01.399 
coming through there yeah that's not
good<00:00:59.040> for<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.370> insulation<00:00:59.879> of<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.180> home<00:01:00.409> but

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:01.409 
good for the insulation of the home but

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:06.050 
good for the insulation of the home but
it's<00:01:01.559> also<00:01:01.710> just<00:01:02.690> a<00:01:03.690> welcome<00:01:04.850> welcome<00:01:05.850> mat<00:01:06.030> for

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
it's also just a welcome welcome mat for

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.620 
it's also just a welcome welcome mat for
rodents<00:01:06.860> so<00:01:08.060> first<00:01:09.060> thing<00:01:09.240> we're<00:01:09.360> going<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.510> do

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
rodents so first thing we're going to do

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.080 
rodents so first thing we're going to do
is<00:01:09.750> we're<00:01:09.840> going<00:01:09.870> to<00:01:10.020> use<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.260> copper<00:01:10.650> wall

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
is we're going to use the copper wall

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.399 
is we're going to use the copper wall
the<00:01:12.090> reason<00:01:12.390> we<00:01:12.479> use<00:01:12.509> this<00:01:12.780> is<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:13.110> doesn't

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
the reason we use this is it doesn't

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.730 
the reason we use this is it doesn't
degrade<00:01:13.610> it's<00:01:14.610> going<00:01:14.759> to<00:01:14.820> be<00:01:14.969> just<00:01:15.420> as<00:01:15.740> durable

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
degrade it's going to be just as durable

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.550 
degrade it's going to be just as durable
and<00:01:17.310> intact<00:01:17.759> ten<00:01:18.750> years<00:01:18.960> from<00:01:19.140> now<00:01:19.259> as<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.500> is

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
and intact ten years from now as it is

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.730 
and intact ten years from now as it is
right<00:01:19.950> now<00:01:19.979> there<00:01:20.880> is<00:01:21.000> there<00:01:21.750> is<00:01:21.780> no<00:01:22.049> rusting

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
right now there is there is no rusting

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.410 
right now there is there is no rusting
or<00:01:22.860> anything<00:01:23.070> like<00:01:23.280> that<00:01:23.340> with<00:01:23.670> copper<00:01:24.119> so

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
or anything like that with copper so

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.880 
or anything like that with copper so
what<00:01:25.259> I'm<00:01:25.320> going<00:01:25.469> to<00:01:25.500> do<00:01:25.590> is<00:01:25.649> I'm<00:01:25.740> going<00:01:25.829> to

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.370 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
take<00:01:26.070> this<00:01:26.219> product<00:01:26.960> and<00:01:27.960> I'm<00:01:28.140> going<00:01:28.289> to

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
take this product and I'm going to

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.380 
take this product and I'm going to
literally

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
literally

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.099 
literally
crumple<00:01:30.390> it<00:01:30.479> up<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:32.240> work<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.420> into<00:01:33.840> this

00:01:34.099 --> 00:01:34.109 
crumple it up and work it into this

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:37.789 
crumple it up and work it into this
opening<00:01:35.090> so<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.719> doesn't<00:01:36.990> have<00:01:37.079> to<00:01:37.170> be<00:01:37.259> perfect

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
opening so it doesn't have to be perfect

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.669 
opening so it doesn't have to be perfect
all<00:01:38.789> you<00:01:39.000> trying<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.329> do<00:01:39.479> is<00:01:39.679> essentially

00:01:40.669 --> 00:01:40.679 
all you trying to do is essentially

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:47.029 
all you trying to do is essentially
create<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.689> barrier<00:01:43.310> that<00:01:45.170> the<00:01:46.170> rodents<00:01:46.619> won't

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:47.039 
create a barrier that the rodents won't

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:48.200 
create a barrier that the rodents won't
go<00:01:47.219> through

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
go through

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.010 
go through
so<00:01:48.540> we're<00:01:48.690> gonna<00:01:48.780> do<00:01:48.930> that<00:01:49.050> the<00:01:49.230> entire<00:01:49.560> length

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
so we're gonna do that the entire length

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:57.590 
so we're gonna do that the entire length
get<00:01:52.020> that<00:01:52.170> good<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.410> shove<00:01:52.770> in<00:01:52.980> there<00:01:56.600> because

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
get that good and shove in there because

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.230 
get that good and shove in there because
this<00:01:57.750> is<00:01:57.870> such<00:01:58.080> a<00:01:58.110> deep<00:01:58.470> it's<00:01:58.820> six<00:01:59.820> inch<00:02:00.000> deep

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
this is such a deep it's six inch deep

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.780 
this is such a deep it's six inch deep
groove<00:02:00.480> I'm<00:02:00.660> going<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:01.130> actually<00:02:02.130> use<00:02:02.160> a<00:02:02.310> stick

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
groove I'm going to actually use a stick

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:24.440 
groove I'm going to actually use a stick
to<00:02:03.110> shove<00:02:04.110> some<00:02:04.410> of<00:02:04.500> that<00:02:04.620> in<00:02:04.770> there

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.750 

I<00:02:24.540> can<00:02:25.230> tell<00:02:25.410> you<00:02:25.530> this<00:02:25.709> once<00:02:26.040> this<00:02:26.280> is<00:02:26.489> shoved

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
I can tell you this once this is shoved

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.979 
I can tell you this once this is shoved
in<00:02:26.910> there<00:02:27.060> good<00:02:28.160> no<00:02:29.160> rodent<00:02:29.629> is<00:02:30.629> gonna<00:02:30.810> be<00:02:30.930> able

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
in there good no rodent is gonna be able

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.500 
in there good no rodent is gonna be able
to<00:02:31.080> find<00:02:31.290> their<00:02:31.440> way<00:02:31.470> in<00:02:31.620> through<00:02:31.800> this<00:02:32.510> now

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
to find their way in through this now

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.240 
to find their way in through this now
the<00:02:33.569> copper<00:02:34.080> by<00:02:34.200> its<00:02:34.349> salts<00:02:34.650> not<00:02:34.769> a<00:02:34.830> very<00:02:35.069> good

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
the copper by its salts not a very good

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.509 
the copper by its salts not a very good
insulator<00:02:35.720> so<00:02:36.720> we'll<00:02:37.680> use<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:37.980> expanding

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
insulator so we'll use the expanding

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:41.210 
insulator so we'll use the expanding
foam<00:02:38.730> to<00:02:39.000> do<00:02:39.150> two<00:02:39.330> things<00:02:39.569> one<00:02:40.440> really<00:02:40.950> lock

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
foam to do two things one really lock

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.070 
foam to do two things one really lock
this<00:02:41.489> in<00:02:41.730> place<00:02:41.970> so<00:02:42.650> the<00:02:43.650> rodents<00:02:44.400> can't<00:02:45.080> just

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
this in place so the rodents can't just

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:52.720 
this in place so the rodents can't just
push<00:02:46.349> this<00:02:46.590> out<00:02:46.800> of<00:02:46.920> the<00:02:46.980> way<00:02:47.870> and<00:02:50.810> to<00:02:51.810> create<00:02:52.110> a

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
push this out of the way and to create a

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.000 
push this out of the way and to create a
good<00:02:53.730> seal
