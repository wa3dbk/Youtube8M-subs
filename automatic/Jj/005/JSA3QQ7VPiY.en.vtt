00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
I just showed you before was the matte

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:12.270 
I just showed you before was the matte
one<00:01:05.530> and<00:01:06.160> this<00:01:07.030> is<00:01:07.210> the<00:01:07.450> shimmer<00:01:08.170> one<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:11.680> this

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
one and this is the shimmer one and this

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.990 
one and this is the shimmer one and this
is<00:01:12.460> the<00:01:12.640> shimmer<00:01:13.619> or<00:01:14.619> these<00:01:15.460> are<00:01:15.580> the<00:01:15.670> blushes

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
is the shimmer or these are the blushes

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.279 
is the shimmer or these are the blushes
on<00:01:16.119> the<00:01:16.210> shimmer<00:01:16.420> palette<00:01:17.700> so<00:01:19.259> what<00:01:20.259> I

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:20.289 
on the shimmer palette so what I

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:22.380 
on the shimmer palette so what I
actually<00:01:20.500> realized<00:01:21.280> is<00:01:21.550> that<00:01:21.610> first<00:01:22.300> I

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
actually realized is that first I

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:23.550 
actually realized is that first I
thought<00:01:22.509> that<00:01:22.690> they<00:01:22.780> would<00:01:22.899> be<00:01:22.990> the<00:01:23.289> exact

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
thought that they would be the exact

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.380 
thought that they would be the exact
same<00:01:23.770> colors<00:01:24.280> and<00:01:24.490> just<00:01:24.670> one<00:01:24.880> would<00:01:25.090> be<00:01:25.179> matte

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
same colors and just one would be matte

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.210 
same colors and just one would be matte
finish<00:01:25.720> and<00:01:25.869> one<00:01:26.080> is<00:01:26.200> shimmer<00:01:26.440> finish<00:01:27.009> and

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
finish and one is shimmer finish and

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.400 
finish and one is shimmer finish and
which<00:01:27.340> is<00:01:27.520> not<00:01:27.670> the<00:01:27.850> case<00:01:28.030> the<00:01:28.810> colors<00:01:29.259> that

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410 
which is not the case the colors that

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.650 
which is not the case the colors that
actually<00:01:29.740> come<00:01:29.979> at<00:01:30.429> least<00:01:30.670> on<00:01:30.880> the<00:01:30.970> eyeshadows

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:31.660 
actually come at least on the eyeshadows

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:36.240 
actually come at least on the eyeshadows
are<00:01:32.140> different<00:01:34.530> slightly<00:01:35.530> different<00:01:35.679> I<00:01:36.130> mean

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
are different slightly different I mean

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.040 
are different slightly different I mean
some<00:01:36.459> of<00:01:36.490> them<00:01:36.640> are<00:01:36.849> almost<00:01:37.330> the<00:01:37.810> same<00:01:37.840> but

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.050 
some of them are almost the same but

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.800 
some of them are almost the same but
some<00:01:38.380> of<00:01:38.440> them<00:01:38.560> are<00:01:38.679> a<00:01:38.709> bit<00:01:38.950> different<00:01:39.569> this<00:01:40.569> is

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
some of them are a bit different this is

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.279 
some of them are a bit different this is
the<00:01:41.280> this<00:01:42.280> is<00:01:42.340> the<00:01:42.459> shimmer<00:01:42.789> one<00:01:43.030> on<00:01:43.690> this<00:01:44.080> side

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:44.289 
the this is the shimmer one on this side

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:46.529 
the this is the shimmer one on this side
this<00:01:44.440> is<00:01:44.500> shimmery<00:01:44.920> this<00:01:45.069> is<00:01:45.220> the<00:01:45.340> matte<00:01:45.550> so

00:01:46.529 --> 00:01:46.539

you can kind of see that there are some
colors<00:01:48.640> that<00:01:48.759> are<00:01:49.119> a<00:01:49.149> little<00:01:49.360> bit<00:01:49.599> different

are<00:02:06.970> and<00:02:07.679> the<00:02:08.679> blush<00:02:09.220> palette<00:02:09.640> is<00:02:11.489> the<00:02:12.489> same

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
are and the blush palette is the same

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.400 
are and the blush palette is the same
let<00:02:14.890> me<00:02:14.980> just<00:02:15.190> compare<00:02:15.580> that<00:02:15.819> yes<00:02:16.450> the<00:02:17.170> blush

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
let me just compare that yes the blush

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.220 
let me just compare that yes the blush
palette<00:02:17.709> is<00:02:18.099> completely<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:19.330> same<00:02:19.569> same

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
palette is completely the same same

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.960 
palette is completely the same same
colors<00:02:20.709> so<00:02:21.340> I'll<00:02:21.430> just<00:02:21.579> show<00:02:21.760> you<00:02:21.790> the<00:02:22.120> one

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
colors so I'll just show you the one

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.800 
colors so I'll just show you the one
it<00:02:24.600> does<00:02:24.750> come<00:02:24.960> with<00:02:24.990> a<00:02:25.350> brush<00:02:25.710> but<00:02:26.100> I<00:02:26.810> don't

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
it does come with a brush but I don't

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.300 
it does come with a brush but I don't
use<00:02:27.930> brushes<00:02:27.960> that<00:02:28.500> come<00:02:28.680> in<00:02:28.800> palette<00:02:29.130> so<00:02:29.280> I

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
use brushes that come in palette so I

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.830 
use brushes that come in palette so I
don't<00:02:29.520> I<00:02:29.670> won't<00:02:29.880> even<00:02:30.000> really<00:02:30.330> review<00:02:30.660> those

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
don't I won't even really review those

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.840 
don't I won't even really review those
this<00:02:31.410> is<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.680> blushes<00:02:32.070> that<00:02:32.100> come<00:02:32.460> with<00:02:32.640> them

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
this is the blushes that come with them

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.760 
this is the blushes that come with them
there's<00:02:33.270> ten<00:02:33.570> of<00:02:33.600> them<00:02:33.750> so<00:02:34.110> you've<00:02:34.260> got<00:02:34.470> some

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
there's ten of them so you've got some

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.710 
there's ten of them so you've got some
really<00:02:34.980> really<00:02:35.100> bright<00:02:35.520> ones<00:02:35.910> some<00:02:36.270> darker

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
really really bright ones some darker

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.940 
really really bright ones some darker
ones<00:02:36.960> and<00:02:38.360> these<00:02:39.360> blushes<00:02:40.050> I<00:02:40.080> tried<00:02:40.650> them<00:02:40.830> out

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
ones and these blushes I tried them out

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.870 
ones and these blushes I tried them out
and<00:02:41.220> they're<00:02:41.730> very<00:02:42.270> very<00:02:42.540> pigmented<00:02:43.880> they're

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
and they're very very pigmented they're

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.020 
and they're very very pigmented they're
not<00:02:45.120> quite<00:02:45.450> as<00:02:45.720> smooth<00:02:46.560> and<00:02:47.040> as<00:02:47.520> easy<00:02:47.790> to

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
not quite as smooth and as easy to

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.690 
not quite as smooth and as easy to
spread<00:02:48.450> for<00:02:48.720> example<00:02:49.110> as<00:02:49.290> Mac<00:02:49.740> blushes<00:02:50.490> so<00:02:50.640> I

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
spread for example as Mac blushes so I

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:51.800 
spread for example as Mac blushes so I
wouldn't<00:02:51.030> really<00:02:51.180> say<00:02:51.480> that<00:02:51.630> they're<00:02:51.780> the

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
wouldn't really say that they're the

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.410 
wouldn't really say that they're the
same<00:02:52.200> but<00:02:52.530> they<00:02:53.310> are<00:02:53.430> comparable<00:02:54.000> to<00:02:54.150> some

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
same but they are comparable to some

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.280 
same but they are comparable to some
other<00:02:54.600> blushes<00:02:54.870> that<00:02:55.050> I<00:02:55.170> have<00:02:55.380> from<00:02:55.740> La<00:02:56.190> Femme

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
other blushes that I have from La Femme

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.540 
other blushes that I have from La Femme
so<00:02:58.290> I<00:02:58.320> would<00:02:58.620> say<00:02:58.800> that<00:02:58.980> they're<00:02:59.220> they<00:02:59.520> are

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
so I would say that they're they are

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.050 
so I would say that they're they are
good<00:02:59.850> quality<00:03:00.330> but<00:03:01.459> they're<00:03:02.459> not<00:03:02.580> the<00:03:02.730> same<00:03:02.910> as

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
good quality but they're not the same as

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.600 
good quality but they're not the same as
Mac<00:03:03.300> or<00:03:03.660> NARS<00:03:04.260> of<00:03:04.680> course<00:03:04.920> because<00:03:05.190> NARS<00:03:05.430> is

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
Mac or NARS of course because NARS is

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.640 
Mac or NARS of course because NARS is
like<00:03:05.790> the<00:03:06.090> best<00:03:06.270> blushes<00:03:06.780> out<00:03:07.020> there<00:03:07.380> but

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
like the best blushes out there but

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.860 
like the best blushes out there but
again<00:03:08.250> the<00:03:08.640> price<00:03:08.970> or<00:03:09.270> something<00:03:09.570> like<00:03:09.660> this

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
again the price or something like this

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.170 
again the price or something like this
is<00:03:10.020> really<00:03:10.200> good<00:03:10.320> so<00:03:11.250> these<00:03:11.670> are<00:03:11.820> rare<00:03:12.000> very

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
is really good so these are rare very

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.330 
is really good so these are rare very
very<00:03:12.630> very<00:03:12.810> pigmented<00:03:13.350> really<00:03:13.920> good<00:03:14.070> color

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
palettes and what I can say about these

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.750 
palettes and what I can say about these
is<00:03:32.700> that<00:03:32.820> these<00:03:33.030> are<00:03:33.330> very<00:03:34.340> they're<00:03:35.340> very<00:03:35.580> very

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.890 
pigmented and what I notice is that

those other pellets like the 120
eyeshadow<00:03:42.080> palette<00:03:43.080> is<00:03:43.200> one<00:03:43.410> of<00:03:43.530> my<00:03:43.680> favorites

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
eyeshadow palette is one of my favorites

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.420 
eyeshadow palette is one of my favorites
from<00:03:44.640> all<00:03:45.000> those<00:03:45.120> palettes<00:03:45.630> but<00:03:45.870> the<00:03:46.500> 120<00:03:47.310> is

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
from all those palettes but the 120 is

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.430 
from all those palettes but the 120 is
really<00:03:47.970> really<00:03:48.239> really<00:03:48.570> soft<00:03:48.959> and<00:03:49.200> very

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
really really really soft and very

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.650 
really really really soft and very
fragile<00:03:49.980> and<00:03:50.190> these<00:03:50.610> ones<00:03:50.850> aren't<00:03:51.060> quite<00:03:51.390> as

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
fragile and these ones aren't quite as

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.780 
fragile and these ones aren't quite as
soft<00:03:51.930> I<00:03:52.350> mean<00:03:52.590> they<00:03:52.739> are<00:03:52.980> still<00:03:53.310> pretty<00:03:53.489> soft

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
soft I mean they are still pretty soft

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.729 
soft I mean they are still pretty soft
but<00:03:54.150> they're<00:03:54.330> not<00:03:54.390> as<00:03:54.780> soft<00:03:55.140> as<00:03:55.440> something

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
but they're not as soft as something

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:58.670 
but they're not as soft as something
with<00:03:55.860> 120<00:03:56.760> if<00:03:57.600> I<00:03:57.750> had<00:03:57.900> to<00:03:58.019> compare<00:03:58.470> these

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
with 120 if I had to compare these

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.970 
with 120 if I had to compare these
another<00:03:59.130> popular<00:03:59.670> one<00:03:59.910> is<00:04:00.120> the<00:04:00.150> 88<00:04:00.750> matte<00:04:01.680> and

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
another popular one is the 88 matte and

satin or the 88 shimmer palette if I

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.490

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
I would get these double stack ones

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.080 
I would get these double stack ones
because<00:04:09.930> I<00:04:10.170> like<00:04:10.830> the<00:04:10.950> quality<00:04:11.220> of<00:04:11.519> these<00:04:11.670> more

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
quality as Mac no they're not but the

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.750 
quality as Mac no they're not but the
thing<00:05:02.200> is<00:05:02.230> I<00:05:02.530> don't<00:05:02.830> like<00:05:03.130> comparing

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:03.760 
thing is I don't like comparing

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:05.350 
eyeshadows saying oh these are like Mac

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:07.350 
eyeshadows saying oh these are like Mac
or<00:05:05.590> these<00:05:05.710> aren't<00:05:06.010> because<00:05:06.460> every<00:05:07.150> company

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
or these aren't because every company

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.600 
or these aren't because every company
has<00:05:07.570> different<00:05:08.080> finishes<00:05:08.440> be<00:05:09.280> it<00:05:09.400> you<00:05:09.580> know

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
has different finishes be it you know

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.760 
has different finishes be it you know
high<00:05:09.940> end<00:05:10.180> or<00:05:10.330> low<00:05:10.360> end<00:05:10.540> and<00:05:10.990> it's<00:05:11.410> just<00:05:11.470> really

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 
high end or low end and it's just really

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:13.950 
high end or low end and it's just really
hard<00:05:12.010> to<00:05:12.160> compare<00:05:12.340> i<00:05:12.940> shadow<00:05:13.450> finishes

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 
hard to compare i shadow finishes

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.110 
hard to compare i shadow finishes
because<00:05:14.110> you<00:05:15.010> know<00:05:15.130> I<00:05:15.160> have<00:05:15.400> some<00:05:15.670> Mac<00:05:15.910> eye

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
because you know I have some Mac eye

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.000 
because you know I have some Mac eye
shadows<00:05:16.570> that<00:05:16.600> are<00:05:16.960> not<00:05:17.290> very<00:05:17.530> good<00:05:17.590> at<00:05:17.740> all

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.010 
shadows that are not very good at all

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:19.560 
shadows that are not very good at all
where<00:05:18.340> I<00:05:18.370> would<00:05:18.580> actually<00:05:18.730> prefer<00:05:19.180> this

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.570 
where I would actually prefer this

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.630 
where I would actually prefer this
palette<00:05:19.990> and<00:05:20.140> then<00:05:20.620> I<00:05:20.710> have<00:05:20.890> some<00:05:21.160> obviously

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:21.640 
palette and then I have some obviously

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.460 
palette and then I have some obviously
some<00:05:21.700> Mac<00:05:22.030> eye<00:05:22.210> shadows<00:05:22.570> that<00:05:22.600> are<00:05:22.900> better

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.470 
some Mac eye shadows that are better

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:25.350 
some Mac eye shadows that are better
than<00:05:23.620> this<00:05:23.920> palette<00:05:24.280> so<00:05:24.700> it's<00:05:24.850> just<00:05:25.030> it's<00:05:25.210> hard

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
than this palette so it's just it's hard

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.390 
than this palette so it's just it's hard
to<00:05:25.540> compare<00:05:25.990> because<00:05:26.290> Mac<00:05:26.680> also<00:05:27.190> does<00:05:27.370> have

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400 
to compare because Mac also does have

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.980 
to compare because Mac also does have
lots<00:05:27.730> of<00:05:27.880> different<00:05:28.150> finishes<00:05:28.300> so<00:05:28.720> I<00:05:28.750> can't

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990 
lots of different finishes so I can't

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:30.570 
lots of different finishes so I can't
really<00:05:29.140> say<00:05:29.440> oh<00:05:29.470> they're<00:05:29.800> better<00:05:30.100> or<00:05:30.310> worse

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
really say oh they're better or worse

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.780 
really say oh they're better or worse
they're<00:05:31.240> just<00:05:31.510> different<00:05:31.980> these<00:05:32.980> are<00:05:33.040> a<00:05:33.340> great

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:33.790 
they're just different these are a great

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:36.180 
they're just different these are a great
bargain<00:05:34.120> though<00:05:34.540> I<00:05:34.780> mean<00:05:35.200> these<00:05:35.470> are<00:05:35.620> for

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.190 
bargain though I mean these are for

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:37.950 
bargain though I mean these are for
people<00:05:36.220> who<00:05:36.460> don't<00:05:36.550> want<00:05:37.210> to<00:05:37.270> spend<00:05:37.510> a<00:05:37.750> lot<00:05:37.900> of

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 
people who don't want to spend a lot of

learn how to get better at makeup and
you<00:05:54.430> don't<00:05:54.580> want<00:05:54.700> to<00:05:54.760> splurge<00:05:55.030> on<00:05:55.180> a<00:05:55.240> bunch<00:05:55.480> of

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:55.630 
you don't want to splurge on a bunch of

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.200 
you don't want to splurge on a bunch of
expensive<00:05:55.990> makeup<00:05:56.410> then<00:05:56.740> I<00:05:56.770> would<00:05:57.210> check

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:58.210 
expensive makeup then I would check

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:58.650 
expensive makeup then I would check
these<00:05:58.360> out

00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:58.660 
these out

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.080 
these out
I<00:05:59.050> mean<00:05:59.410> I'll<00:05:59.890> definitely<00:06:00.400> be<00:06:00.520> using<00:06:00.880> these

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.090 
I mean I'll definitely be using these

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:05.180 
I mean I'll definitely be using these
because<00:06:01.930> I<00:06:02.260> really<00:06:02.500> like<00:06:02.680> the<00:06:02.830> color<00:06:03.070> payoff

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:05.190 
because I really like the color payoff

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:07.650 
because I really like the color payoff
like<00:06:06.190> I<00:06:06.310> said<00:06:06.520> they<00:06:06.670> are<00:06:06.700> a<00:06:06.850> little<00:06:07.120> bit<00:06:07.360> dusty

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:07.660 
like I said they are a little bit dusty

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.720 
like I said they are a little bit dusty
I<00:06:07.870> mean<00:06:08.200> not<00:06:08.380> they're<00:06:08.740> not<00:06:08.770> dusty<00:06:09.370> as<00:06:09.550> in

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:09.730 
I mean not they're not dusty as in

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:12.240 
I mean not they're not dusty as in
chalky<00:06:10.090> but<00:06:10.510> when<00:06:10.750> you<00:06:10.930> when<00:06:11.530> you<00:06:11.650> know<00:06:11.800> put

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:12.250 
chalky but when you when you know put

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:13.860 
chalky but when you when you know put
your<00:06:12.370> eyeshadow<00:06:12.580> brush<00:06:13.150> on<00:06:13.390> it<00:06:13.450> there's<00:06:13.810> a

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:13.870 
your eyeshadow brush on it there's a

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:15.810 
your eyeshadow brush on it there's a
little<00:06:14.080> bit<00:06:14.230> of<00:06:14.260> residue<00:06:15.010> that<00:06:15.190> comes<00:06:15.460> off<00:06:15.640> but

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:15.820 
little bit of residue that comes off but

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:17.520 
little bit of residue that comes off but
that's<00:06:16.000> the<00:06:16.270> same<00:06:16.450> with<00:06:16.720> all<00:06:16.930> those<00:06:17.050> palettes

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:17.530 
that's the same with all those palettes

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:18.510 
that's the same with all those palettes
so<00:06:17.650> I<00:06:17.680> don't<00:06:17.890> think<00:06:18.040> that's<00:06:18.220> really<00:06:18.490> a

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:18.520 
so I don't think that's really a

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.000 
so I don't think that's really a
negative<00:06:18.820> point<00:06:19.240> it's<00:06:19.480> just<00:06:19.800> something<00:06:20.800> to<00:06:20.890> be

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:21.010 
negative point it's just something to be

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:23.550 
negative point it's just something to be
aware<00:06:21.040> of<00:06:21.400> but<00:06:22.390> for<00:06:22.570> the<00:06:22.660> price<00:06:22.930> I<00:06:23.200> think<00:06:23.230> these

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:23.560 
aware of but for the price I think these

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.250 
aware of but for the price I think these
are<00:06:23.740> excellent<00:06:24.280> the<00:06:25.120> matte<00:06:25.510> ones<00:06:25.840> are<00:06:26.080> also

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:26.260 
are excellent the matte ones are also

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.040 
are excellent the matte ones are also
really<00:06:26.770> cool<00:06:26.980> because<00:06:27.300> matte<00:06:28.300> eyeshadows

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:29.050 
really cool because matte eyeshadows

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:31.980 
really cool because matte eyeshadows
often<00:06:29.790> are<00:06:30.790> hard<00:06:31.030> to<00:06:31.150> find<00:06:31.360> in<00:06:31.600> lots<00:06:31.780> of

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:31.990 
often are hard to find in lots of

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:34.580 
often are hard to find in lots of
different<00:06:32.350> colors<00:06:32.740> and<00:06:32.950> you<00:06:33.490> know<00:06:34.060> these<00:06:34.240> are

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:34.590 
different colors and you know these are

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:36.810 
different colors and you know these are
lots<00:06:35.590> of<00:06:35.710> different<00:06:36.010> colors<00:06:36.310> and<00:06:36.580> they're<00:06:36.700> all

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:36.820 
lots of different colors and they're all

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:39.660 
lots of different colors and they're all
a<00:06:36.850> matte<00:06:37.180> finish<00:06:37.600> and<00:06:38.290> the<00:06:39.040> path<00:06:39.190> of<00:06:39.400> these<00:06:39.550> is

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:39.670 
a matte finish and the path of these is

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:41.730 
a matte finish and the path of these is
really<00:06:40.030> good<00:06:40.180> as<00:06:40.330> well<00:06:40.360> so<00:06:41.080> I've<00:06:41.290> used<00:06:41.320> this

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:41.740 
really good as well so I've used this

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:45.810 
really good as well so I've used this
one<00:06:41.950> as<00:06:42.190> well<00:06:42.400> just<00:06:42.700> to<00:06:42.880> test<00:06:43.240> it<00:06:43.450> out<00:06:43.570> and<00:06:44.820> yeah

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:45.820 
one as well just to test it out and yeah

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:47.130 
one as well just to test it out and yeah
that's<00:06:46.060> pretty<00:06:46.120> much<00:06:46.360> all<00:06:46.510> I<00:06:46.570> can<00:06:46.840> say<00:06:47.020> about

that's pretty much all I can say about

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:47.460 
that's pretty much all I can say about
these

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:47.470 
these

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:50.490
