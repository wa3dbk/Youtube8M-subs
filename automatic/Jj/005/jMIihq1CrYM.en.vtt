00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 alongside the opposition harold iman 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.690
 geopolitical specialists on bfm tv 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.519
 joined us harold using drones 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.530
 has become usual for the United States 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.960
 who have used less in Pakistan or 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.500
 still in yemen for example they do this 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.070
 which they call target packets 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:21.330
 target package 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.609
 it means that the cia distribute to to 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.090
 military portraits of people 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.039
 that must be sought and eliminated with this 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.410
 kind of a gear there it's a 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.070
 predator that launches a missile 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.260
 hellfire 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.329
 it must be a terrible thing and 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.460
 here are all the countries where we feel the 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.070
 servile to with a star and the 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.809
 Americans I speak and there is the case 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.090
 israel to gaza 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.160
 so you see that it's a panoply 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.590
 pretty huge huh we forget that they 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.620
 have used quite a lot in Libya against 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.960
 troops of Gaddafi and Yemen against al 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.579
 qaeda in somalia against shebab as 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.219
 we call them in Pakistan and in 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.230
 afghanistan against al qaeda maybe 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.329
 around 33 thousand dead including one 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.280
 fifth were civilians 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.680
 certainly but all these numbers 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.180
 remain pretty blurry and then of course the 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.220
 new profession that develops is 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.700
 that of drone pilots and the pilot 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.710
 drones 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.610
 well he's sitting like that in a 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:20.250
 armchair and does not have contact with 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.290
 the atmosphere of the conflict which poses to him 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.689
 psychological problems by the 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.850
 following then to rolle how is it 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.350
 find if one side is Weapon 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.970
 rebels we are not yet and of 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.920
 the other one is killing the radical Islamists 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.840
 who are part of the opposition the front 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.630
 would show themselves how the franc is 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.310
 complicated because now every 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.740
 country is going from its small idea 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.520
 so the Russians the Iranian weapons 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.290
 bachar al-assad and he already has the 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.100
 monopoly of the sky with its helicopters 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:52.200
 and his planes so the French the 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.869
 British would like to give arms to 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.180
 the Free Syrian Army this one has it is 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.659
 the one who is good I say secular but these 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.159
 laity 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.070
 it's anything but jihadists if you 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.600
 want and them if they had angels to 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.210
 to get off the planes the 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.179
 helicopters that restore the scale but 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.060
 they are weak too and then the states 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.340
 united on will be decided 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.700
 magnet to attack the group the most 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.530
 terrible jihadist Islamists who 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.459
 tributary especially in the north 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:24.849
 and who are quite violent and who do not 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:27.170
 are not at all ally to the sl except 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:29.690
 episodically on the ground of which you 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.280
 see the Americans stop this the 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.910
 french ones and english people like 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.120
 it 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.640
 we do not know where it's going to lead but that's it 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.959
 this is the current grand opening on 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.959
 this so complicated front
