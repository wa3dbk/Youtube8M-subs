 they want me to ask what is going to be 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.460
 its celebration is that it does so much 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.909
 What to say so I know that from Giovanni dos 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:20.799

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.799

 a wife so tell my daughters that 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.650
 they want you to ask the 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.780
 game developers because it is not 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.790

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.800

 that you tell me on my twitter 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.580
 because I'm going to see and be able to ask questions 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.590
 but I know what they want to ask 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:46.370
 ask so let's start with the 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:50.000
 video I bring you the best template 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:52.850
 mexico more than 100 thousand coins and in that 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.710
 template the best of all so 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.540
 in these helps to tell me what it is 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.610
 so incredible we can improve it more if 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.200
 they like it or not put in the comments 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.730
 I am also remember that they would give 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.410
 Martin is what they want because we are going to 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.810
 go to prove that for 15 I'm going to do 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:08.920
 a blog and all that, so we'll see each other 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.920
 the next video 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:15.260
 very well my crumbs because it has given 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:18.109
 excellent performance that mexico had in 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.629
 the world and everything beautiful we live 

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:23.629
 although the referee confused football 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:25.250
 with a water polo field if not that 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:28.760
 explains why he let himself throw himself 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.439
 nailed this I have decided to create this 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.900
 beautiful template with the best 

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:33.950
 players the most expensive and before that 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.260
 for those who are not Mexican 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.079
 extending the background gameplay this 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.299
 Chilean is the best goal I've ever lived 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:43.340
 in my life with mexico that I'm going to 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:45.409
 explain fast Mexico is going to tie 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.980
 one to one against panama there were five 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:51.500
 minutes and the last five minutes raul 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.900
 jiménez goal this goal without mexico 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.989
 tied was out of the world 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:59.030
 literal was out of the world so 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.209
 this was incredible for all 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.209
 Mexicans 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.790
 but very well let's start with what 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.040
 we care what the template is 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.579
 template 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.290
 the best template from mexico the best 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:16.650
 World Cup players with men 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.359
 of the party and the most expensive is here and 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.829
 let's start with memo ochoa which is 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:22.319
 brutal 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:25.319
 it's really amazing to see with the letter 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:28.349
 that I put special has 98 jumping to 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:30.540
 99 of reflections is amazing 8 I swear 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:32.159
 that is amazing also outside the 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.650
 defense I think it's perfect good 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:36.269
 here we have a super lice dad louse 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.519
 that obviously can not be missing in this 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.629
 video but see I think the defense is 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:42.150
 amazing 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:43.470
 I do not have to move anything miguel layún and 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.659
 Paul Aguilar, I think they are the best 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.310
 lanes that have mexico rafa 

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:49.200
 Marquez and Moreno I think they are the 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.359
 better central defenses like they have 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.010
 mexico so there's nothing moving in the 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:54.689
 mean I have the problem and also the 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.819
 front as you can see I'm doing 

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:59.010
 of changes a problem is with hector 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:01.620
 Herrera who does not recognize fifa el super 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.530
 crack that is hector herrera and I have to 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.120
 change to the second time for chicharito 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.769
 but from there on out also in the 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.940
 front I have the problem of I do not know if 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:13.430
 leave the beautiful to the beautiful but 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.620
 the center forward will change to white 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.720
 giovani dos saints because I accompanied him 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.610
 but well my links you tell me what 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.380
 do with this template I think it's 

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:22.880
 incredible I've played four games and 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.860
 I swear I 'm winning it all 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.840
 against first division teams 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.150
 second division forgiveness because it 's 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.410
 in the second division and it's amazing then 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.600

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.490
