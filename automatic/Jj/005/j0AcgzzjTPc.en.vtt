00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.639
 sorry I'm waiting for you to be sure 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:14.639
 first to drink, that is, it would be a juice of 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:16.260
 fruit to yo but we are the first not 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.109
 look at today the chicken just does not go 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.710
 what else do you have before do not 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.359
 takes nothing I don't seem to be a 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:29.060
 demanding customer, but you give me this 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.060
 stuff here I'm leaving look at baby 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:34.130
 I live there 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:46.770
 hello to everyone more notes in this but what 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.330
 say the songs of anime 8 like 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.739
 you have surely noticed it is a bit the 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.960
 meter from the usual because I type 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.190
 doubled the initial part since 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.690
 I read in the comments that what 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.340
 in fact, you prefer the one I prefer 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.989
 too, however, because that 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.880
 when mounting it I enjoy it more than 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.650
 all then following yours 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.390
 hundreds of tips 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.430
 I decided to remove the part 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.530
 I practically explain what it means 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.240
 song and stretch with the initials 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.220
 seems like diets in the comments though maybe 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.320
 I could write the songs I used to 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.000
 make this video description also from 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.159
 this video you also tutor another 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.260
 important news if you have noticed these 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.180
 bets have come out so far a little way myself 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.460
 I think about two years have started 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.980
 ago and I left my six months two 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.560
 months a year a little fucking came out 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.159
 let's say then from now I want to reward 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.290
 practically when these episodes 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.380
 will reach 800 I like to leave immediately 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.430
 the episode nine 800 episodes like that 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.870
 everything will depend on him 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.580
 maybe first while I like it can 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.650
 not seem nonsense anyway 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.750
 there was so much weight but I care 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.520
 really because every like sees me 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.620
 it always spurs more on making videos is the 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.870
 your feedback that makes me want to 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.730
 to keep making videos you'll make of them 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.290
 more and more so thank you for 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.730
 I hope you left a live 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.440
 as usual I remind you that these 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.300
 episodes are built entirely 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.650
 thanks to you then comment below 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.930
 with the Japanese song that indicates 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.460
 absurd word meaningless thank you for 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.650
 quarters those who suggested me 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.840
 songs of this episode really are 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.360
 remained happy that market is written 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.730
 almost all now the link with the 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.230
 according to the precise word " chi" 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.909
 practice 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.349
 it is simplified a lot at work in 

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:17.569
 description also found the page 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:20.360
