pen collection has grown I've gotten
lots<00:01:48.420> of<00:01:48.570> different<00:01:48.869> color<00:01:49.049> pens<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:49.619> found

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
lots of different color pens I found

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.920 
lots of different color pens I found
that<00:01:50.280> I<00:01:50.310> am<00:01:50.520> kind<00:01:50.850> of<00:01:50.939> tending<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.479> put<00:01:51.780> the

that I am kind of tending to put the

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.139 
that I am kind of tending to put the
color<00:01:52.500> ink<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:53.159> matches<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.610> pen<00:01:53.820> I<00:01:54.000> don't

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149

color ink the matches the pen I don't
know<00:01:54.210> why<00:01:54.360> it's<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.110> weird<00:01:55.320> thing<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.560> I<00:01:55.710> know

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
know why it's a weird thing and I know

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.399 
know why it's a weird thing and I know
there's<00:01:56.280> no<00:01:56.460> logic<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:56.909> it<00:01:57.030> at<00:01:57.210> all<00:01:57.360> but<00:01:58.049> let<00:01:58.320> me

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
there's no logic to it at all but let me

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.209 
there's no logic to it at all but let me
go<00:01:58.500> ahead<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:58.649> walk<00:01:58.829> you<00:01:58.950> through<00:01:59.009> this

review so the custom setting for medium

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.950

just because that's a Japanese knit and
that's<00:02:06.180> how<00:02:06.689> they<00:02:06.869> tend<00:02:07.079> to<00:02:07.140> run

side on this Rodya paper I know that I

and<00:02:22.800> I'm<00:02:23.160> okay<00:02:23.550> with<00:02:23.700> that<00:02:23.880> what<00:02:24.090> I<00:02:24.120> do<00:02:24.270> is<00:02:24.570> I

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
and I'm okay with that what I do is I

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.510 
and I'm okay with that what I do is I
just<00:02:24.690> write<00:02:25.470> whatever<00:02:25.800> I'm<00:02:25.950> writing<00:02:26.370> on<00:02:26.460> it

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
just write whatever I'm writing on it

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.910 
just write whatever I'm writing on it
set<00:02:27.000> it<00:02:27.120> aside<00:02:27.210> for<00:02:27.420> 30<00:02:28.080> seconds<00:02:28.590> maybe<00:02:28.830> a

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
set it aside for 30 seconds maybe a

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.070 
set it aside for 30 seconds maybe a
minute<00:02:29.130> if<00:02:29.610> I've<00:02:29.730> got<00:02:29.880> the<00:02:30.000> time<00:02:30.210> and<00:02:30.450> then

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
minute if I've got the time and then

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.810 
minute if I've got the time and then
come<00:02:31.260> back<00:02:31.290> to<00:02:31.620> it<00:02:31.650> or<00:02:31.980> I<00:02:32.010> can<00:02:32.280> use<00:02:32.310> a<00:02:32.430> blotter

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
come back to it or I can use a blotter

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.340 
come back to it or I can use a blotter
too<00:02:33.180> I've<00:02:33.450> got<00:02:33.600> a<00:02:33.630> video<00:02:33.870> on<00:02:33.930> how<00:02:34.110> to<00:02:34.140> use<00:02:34.320> a

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
too I've got a video on how to use a

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.620 
too I've got a video on how to use a
blotter<00:02:34.760> that<00:02:35.760> can<00:02:35.970> something<00:02:36.210> that<00:02:36.330> can<00:02:36.540> help

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
blotter that can something that can help

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.300 
blotter that can something that can help
with<00:02:36.810> this<00:02:36.900> thing<00:02:36.960> too<00:02:37.260> but<00:02:37.560> I<00:02:37.740> won't<00:02:38.100> let<00:02:38.190> that

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
with this thing too but I won't let that

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.880 
with this thing too but I won't let that
deter<00:02:38.610> me<00:02:38.760> I<00:02:38.850> love<00:02:39.060> the<00:02:39.180> sink<00:02:39.360> the<00:02:40.350> drip<00:02:40.650> test

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
deter me I love the sink the drip test

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.640 
deter me I love the sink the drip test
this<00:02:41.550> ink<00:02:41.850> is<00:02:42.030> not<00:02:42.060> that<00:02:42.810> water-resistant<00:02:43.620> I

this ink is not that water-resistant I

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.740 
this ink is not that water-resistant I
left<00:02:43.830> it<00:02:43.950> on<00:02:44.040> here<00:02:44.220> for<00:02:44.250> about<00:02:44.490> 45<00:02:44.940> seconds<00:02:45.720> to

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
left it on here for about 45 seconds to

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.890 
left it on here for about 45 seconds to
a<00:02:45.840> minute<00:02:46.430> you<00:02:47.430> can<00:02:47.610> still<00:02:47.850> kind<00:02:48.210> of<00:02:48.480> see<00:02:48.540> where

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
a minute you can still kind of see where

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.080 
a minute you can still kind of see where
it<00:02:49.020> was<00:02:49.200> but<00:02:49.590> if<00:02:49.800> you<00:02:49.980> drop<00:02:50.550> water<00:02:50.820> on<00:02:51.000> this

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
it was but if you drop water on this

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.820 
it was but if you drop water on this
page<00:02:51.300> you<00:02:51.840> can<00:02:51.870> pretty<00:02:52.080> much<00:02:52.200> assume<00:02:52.560> it's<00:02:52.709> not

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
page you can pretty much assume it's not

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.650 
page you can pretty much assume it's not
going<00:02:53.010> to<00:02:53.100> last<00:02:53.580> all<00:02:53.850> that<00:02:53.970> long<00:02:54.030> so<00:02:54.420> if<00:02:54.510> water

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
going to last all that long so if water

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.150 
going to last all that long so if water
resistance<00:02:55.140> is<00:02:55.290> something<00:02:55.620> that's<00:02:55.770> important

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
resistance is something that's important

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.000 
resistance is something that's important
to<00:02:56.220> you<00:02:56.310> maybe<00:02:56.880> try<00:02:57.180> another<00:02:57.330> rink<00:02:57.650> the<00:02:58.650> swabs

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
to you maybe try another rink the swabs

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.070 
to you maybe try another rink the swabs
you<00:02:59.580> can<00:02:59.730> hardly<00:02:59.970> tell<00:03:00.240> where<00:03:00.600> the<00:03:00.750> one<00:03:00.900> two

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
you can hardly tell where the one two

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.810 
you can hardly tell where the one two
and<00:03:01.110> three<00:03:01.500> swabs<00:03:01.800> are<00:03:02.070> because<00:03:02.520> this<00:03:02.670> is<00:03:02.790> a

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
and three swabs are because this is a

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.230 
and three swabs are because this is a
heavily<00:03:03.180> saturated<00:03:03.810> ink<00:03:03.990> lots<00:03:04.860> of<00:03:05.040> bold<00:03:05.730> color

heavily saturated ink lots of bold color

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.880 
heavily saturated ink lots of bold color
of<00:03:06.780> this<00:03:06.930> ink<00:03:07.110> and<00:03:07.260> I<00:03:07.290> think<00:03:07.500> that's<00:03:07.650> kind<00:03:07.860> of

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
of this ink and I think that's kind of

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.130 
of this ink and I think that's kind of
why<00:03:08.010> I<00:03:08.040> like<00:03:08.130> it<00:03:08.400> so<00:03:08.550> much<00:03:08.610> so<00:03:09.450> dry<00:03:09.660> time<00:03:09.870> 30

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
why I like it so much so dry time 30

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.720 
why I like it so much so dry time 30
plus<00:03:10.350> seconds<00:03:10.770> the<00:03:10.830> saturation<00:03:11.280> is<00:03:11.490> heavy

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
very heavy water resistance is low I

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.490 
very heavy water resistance is low I
won't<00:03:14.730> say<00:03:14.820> it's<00:03:14.970> non-existent<00:03:15.450> because<00:03:16.230> you

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
won't say it's non-existent because you

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.229 
won't say it's non-existent because you
can<00:03:16.740> still<00:03:17.190> see<00:03:17.370> the<00:03:17.459> lines<00:03:17.610> I've<00:03:17.820> seen<00:03:18.000> inks

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:19.580 
can still see the lines I've seen inks
that<00:03:18.269> are<00:03:18.390> worse<00:03:18.630> than<00:03:18.810> this<00:03:18.989> but<00:03:19.170> it's<00:03:19.350> it's

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
that are worse than this but it's it's

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.520 
that are worse than this but it's it's
down<00:03:19.830> there<00:03:20.100> the<00:03:21.090> ease<00:03:21.239> of<00:03:21.269> cleaning<00:03:21.900> medium

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
down there the ease of cleaning medium

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.290 
down there the ease of cleaning medium
you<00:03:22.890> know<00:03:22.920> the<00:03:23.160> degree<00:03:23.459> of<00:03:23.519> saturation<00:03:23.760> in<00:03:24.239> the

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
you know the degree of saturation in the

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:25.460 
you know the degree of saturation in the
sink<00:03:24.540> makes<00:03:24.690> it<00:03:24.840> a<00:03:24.900> little<00:03:25.080> bit<00:03:25.230> harder<00:03:25.440> to

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
sink makes it a little bit harder to

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.080 
sink makes it a little bit harder to
clean<00:03:25.709> out<00:03:25.890> but<00:03:26.010> it's<00:03:26.130> not<00:03:26.250> gonna<00:03:26.400> clean<00:03:26.880> to

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
clean out but it's not gonna clean to

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.360 
clean out but it's not gonna clean to
the<00:03:27.120> pen<00:03:27.450> or<00:03:27.600> anything<00:03:28.190> challenging<00:03:29.190> like

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
the pen or anything challenging like

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.550 
the pen or anything challenging like
that<00:03:29.610> so<00:03:29.850> it's<00:03:30.269> it's<00:03:30.540> it's<00:03:30.930> up<00:03:31.170> there<00:03:31.290> it's<00:03:31.440> not

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
that so it's it's it's up there it's not

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.810 
that so it's it's it's up there it's not
the<00:03:31.650> easiest<00:03:31.950> clean<00:03:32.280> it's<00:03:32.400> not<00:03:32.489> the<00:03:32.610> hardest

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
the easiest clean it's not the hardest

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.759 
the easiest clean it's not the hardest
so<00:03:32.970> more<00:03:33.060> in<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.180> middle<00:03:33.360> on<00:03:34.080> the<00:03:34.320> shading

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
so more in the middle on the shading

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:36.440 
so more in the middle on the shading
medium<00:03:35.400> to<00:03:35.489> high<00:03:35.670> even<00:03:36.030> though<00:03:36.180> it's<00:03:36.360> a<00:03:36.420> very

medium to high even though it's a very
saturated<00:03:37.290> color<00:03:37.560> you<00:03:38.130> can<00:03:38.250> still<00:03:38.580> get<00:03:38.850> a<00:03:38.880> good

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
saturated color you can still get a good

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.020 
saturated color you can still get a good

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
to depend a lot on the nib you know so

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.130 
to depend a lot on the nib you know so
be<00:03:46.860> aware<00:03:46.950> of<00:03:47.190> that<00:03:47.340> the<00:03:48.269> flow<00:03:48.540> is<00:03:48.570> medium<00:03:48.989> to
