doing it well one of the things that we
know<00:02:04.619> is<00:02:04.950> that<00:02:05.340> this<00:02:05.579> this<00:02:05.880> one<00:02:06.060> is<00:02:06.149> made<00:02:06.270> with

00:02:06.379 --> 00:02:06.389 
know is that this this one is made with

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:08.570 
know is that this this one is made with
minimal<00:02:06.869> sulfites<00:02:07.350> they<00:02:07.770> use<00:02:07.950> nitrogen

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
minimal sulfites they use nitrogen

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.880 
minimal sulfites they use nitrogen
instead<00:02:09.119> and<00:02:09.360> it<00:02:09.450> means<00:02:09.690> that<00:02:10.050> when<00:02:10.500> you<00:02:10.619> get

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
instead and it means that when you get

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.440 
instead and it means that when you get
the<00:02:11.070> wine<00:02:11.250> you<00:02:11.460> actually<00:02:11.820> pour<00:02:12.060> out<00:02:12.210> a<00:02:12.240> little

the wine you actually pour out a little

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.940 
the wine you actually pour out a little
bit<00:02:12.600> you<00:02:12.840> give<00:02:12.990> it<00:02:13.080> the<00:02:13.170> old<00:02:13.290> Molly<00:02:13.620> Duke

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
bit you give it the old Molly Duke

shake<00:02:14.250> which<00:02:14.489> then<00:02:14.940> opened<00:02:15.270> the<00:02:15.330> cap<00:02:15.540> which

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
shake which then opened the cap which

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.710 
shake which then opened the cap which
releases<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.680> nitrogen<00:02:17.250> and<00:02:17.450> opens<00:02:18.450> up<00:02:18.569> this

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
releases the nitrogen and opens up this

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.380 
releases the nitrogen and opens up this
wine<00:02:18.989> so<00:02:19.500> it's<00:02:19.680> a<00:02:19.860> it's<00:02:20.160> it's<00:02:20.400> a<00:02:20.550> it's<00:02:20.879> a<00:02:21.090> way<00:02:21.360> of
