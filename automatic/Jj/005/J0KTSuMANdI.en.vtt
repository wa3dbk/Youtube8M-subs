00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.900
 all lie down and drank the same dudes themselves as 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.639
 tedasa not 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.440
 and this is the second part of easter eggs in clash of 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.690
 clans but for those who have not seen the first 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:25.380
 part of the link to it will be in the description well 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:26.880
 and we go to the first easter eggs all 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.369
 we will have the next Easter eggs 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.199
 be based on goblins and they will 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.910
 from the whole past times clash of 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.950
 clans we have two easter eggs at once 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.140
 is on the same map by the way the name 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.190
 cards in English I will write either here in 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.120
 the video itself either 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.040
 leave them no name in the description so in 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.079
 In general, we have an Indian totem 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.239
 chic though maybe this is just decoration 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:52.949
 and does not apply to Easter eggs on it will 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.870
 take it for Easter eggs and 2 this is where it is not 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.640
 let it be all as one that is, we 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.859
 see here and the fences of the legs we have made 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.750
 some words and even the middle itself when 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.840
 kind of a letter but we turn to 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.840
 second 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.140
 we can see a Christmas tree 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.780
 2012 that is, this is the very first 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.740
 Christmas tree in our favorite game but 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.740
 we go to 3 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:24.689
 Well, on this basis, we can already notice 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.580
 once again, too, a Christmas tree only since 2013 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.890
 years that is on these bases it is collected 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.600
 the whole history of Christmas trees clash of clans or 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.310
 and knocked out or not left here you 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.630
 you can always look at her 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.630
 go to the fourth honor 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.780
 this very bottom of the map we can see 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.570
 this is the most common gravestones that is 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.820
 she's having a Halloween holiday with no idea 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:52.030
 what year this time I stream 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.430
 but if we are here the height of the unit, then here we are 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.650
 activated heaps of skeletons 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:59.560
 maximum pumping will not be they 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:07.180
 kill our warriors on we go to 5 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:09.009
 Easter eggs but on this map there is nothing like 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.940
 so special but if we drop 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.660
 unit somewhere 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:16.420
 will be near the stones then we have activated 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:19.209
 old bomb that is kind of pumpkin and so 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:26.170
 near each pebble but we turn to 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:28.600
 6 easter eggs but here we have a monument to the peak 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.730
 fenced with the tenth fence and get and not 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.650
 just so sorry easter egg i'm not 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.810
 I can show how you need jams 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.580
 sang that is, we throw in the middle 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.200
 Jones sang and we need to land 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.540
 any unit so he went into 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.420
 middle and we will fly tps anton and 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.610
 throw off gift in 2013 we had 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.380
 such a potion that was made one day and 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.160
 three such potions could be torn down 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:55.090
 it's a carcass 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:56.470
 but we move to the last Easter eggs but 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.450
 on this basis, we are like 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.700
 ordinary gold vault but if we 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.519
 let you out archers then we get out 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.830
 Tesla and that is it like a mini 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:07.810
 trolling but it's all our easter eggs 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.239
