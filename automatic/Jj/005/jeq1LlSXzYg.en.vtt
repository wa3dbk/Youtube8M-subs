immediately so what is the resolution

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.979 
immediately so what is the resolution
1280<00:00:41.430> by<00:00:41.610> 800<00:00:42.230> alright<00:00:43.230> so<00:00:44.270> what<00:00:45.270> is<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.570> IPS

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
1280 by 800 alright so what is the IPS

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.130 
1280 by 800 alright so what is the IPS
what<00:00:46.289> is<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.469> screen<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:47.100> said<00:00:47.280> IPS<00:00:48.140> good

so<00:00:57.629> 3<00:00:58.440> 188<00:01:00.410> 2gb<00:01:01.410> ram<00:01:01.739> 2gb<00:01:02.280> run<00:01:02.840> and<00:01:04.430> this<00:01:05.430> is

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
so 3 188 2gb ram 2gb run and this is

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.480 
so 3 188 2gb ram 2gb run and this is
very<00:01:05.760> slight<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.659> very<00:01:07.110> slim<00:01:07.560> design<00:01:09.409> only<00:01:10.490> 500

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
very slight a very slim design only 500

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.649 
very slight a very slim design only 500
and<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.000> 10<00:01:12.930> crumb<00:01:13.610> power<00:01:14.610> 10<00:01:14.939> grams<00:01:15.210> in

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
and the 10 crumb power 10 grams in

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.810 
and the 10 crumb power 10 grams in
design<00:01:16.049> but<00:01:16.320> long<00:01:16.830> enough<00:01:16.950> battery<00:01:17.369> life<00:01:17.520> for

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
design but long enough battery life for

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.200 
design but long enough battery life for
battery<00:01:18.420> life<00:01:18.600> is<00:01:18.630> also<00:01:19.049> like<00:01:19.229> eight<00:01:19.830> hours

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
battery life is also like eight hours

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.700 
battery life is also like eight hours
also<00:01:21.210> very<00:01:21.479> long<00:01:21.659> so<00:01:21.960> how<00:01:22.170> big<00:01:22.290> is<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.500> battery

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
also very long so how big is a battery

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.160 
also very long so how big is a battery
capacity<00:01:23.310> in<00:01:23.520> here<00:01:24.320> 6500<00:01:25.340> all<00:01:26.340> right<00:01:26.930> so<00:01:27.930> what

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
capacity in here 6500 all right so what

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.340 
capacity in here 6500 all right so what
is<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.320> difference<00:01:28.560> between<00:01:28.619> this<00:01:28.920> is<00:01:29.070> this

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
is the difference between this is this

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.530 
is the difference between this is this
is<00:01:31.350> it<00:01:31.560> different<00:01:32.070> one<00:01:32.189> of<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.430> same<00:01:32.640> in<00:01:33.329> one

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
is it different one of the same in one

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:40.340 
is it different one of the same in one
thing<00:01:34.200> one<00:01:37.070> so<00:01:38.390> how<00:01:39.390> many<00:01:39.450> do<00:01:39.659> you<00:01:39.689> sell<00:01:39.900> so<00:01:40.140> far

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
thing one so how many do you sell so far

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.050 
thing one so how many do you sell so far
can<00:01:40.799> you<00:01:40.860> say<00:01:41.009> oh<00:01:41.189> where<00:01:41.430> do<00:01:41.520> you<00:01:41.610> sell<00:01:41.790> mostly

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
response this because compared with lost

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.300 
response this because compared with lost
10.1<00:01:50.369> or<00:01:50.520> 9.7<00:01:51.180> this<00:01:51.329> is<00:01:51.479> much<00:01:51.600> more<00:01:51.630> slim<00:01:52.110> is<00:01:53.100> it

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
10.1 or 9.7 this is much more slim is it

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.639 
10.1 or 9.7 this is much more slim is it
similar<00:01:53.759> price<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.270> 10<00:01:54.390> for<00:01:54.570> one<00:01:54.780> was<00:01:55.049> much

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
similar price to 10 for one was much

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.450 
similar price to 10 for one was much
better<00:01:55.860> or<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.630> similar<00:01:57.630> similar<00:01:58.380> yeah<00:01:58.950> so<00:01:59.310> this

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
better or a similar similar yeah so this

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.780 
better or a similar similar yeah so this
is<00:01:59.490> 16<00:02:00.000> x<00:02:00.740> 960<00:02:01.740> x<00:02:01.950> 10<00:02:02.159> 6<00:02:02.369> 55<00:02:03.030> yes<00:02:03.540> so<00:02:03.869> it's<00:02:03.960> like<00:02:03.990> a

is 16 x 960 x 10 6 55 yes so it's like a

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.449 
is 16 x 960 x 10 6 55 yes so it's like a
10.1<00:02:05.790> is<00:02:05.969> also<00:02:06.240> 16<00:02:06.509> x<00:02:06.719> 10<00:02:06.930> or<00:02:07.829> is<00:02:08.039> a<00:02:08.069> different

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
10.1 is also 16 x 10 or is a different

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.440 
10.1 is also 16 x 10 or is a different
aspect<00:02:08.789> ratio<00:02:09.330> also<00:02:09.840> say<00:02:10.200> yeah<00:02:10.349> same<00:02:10.890> sim<00:02:11.640> so

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
aspect ratio also say yeah same sim so

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.630 
aspect ratio also say yeah same sim so
just<00:02:12.660> slightly<00:02:13.050> smaller<00:02:13.440> right<00:02:13.709> yeah<00:02:14.430> yeah

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640

just slightly smaller right yeah yeah
man<00:02:15.300> you<00:02:15.420> keep<00:02:15.450> poking<00:02:15.750> image<00:02:16.080> to<00:02:16.440> see<00:02:16.800> the

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
man you keep poking image to see the

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.110 
man you keep poking image to see the
difference<00:02:17.660> alright<00:02:18.660> that's<00:02:19.319> good<00:02:19.760> so<00:02:20.760> you

difference alright that's good so you
sell<00:02:21.330> more<00:02:21.510> than<00:02:21.569> 10.1<00:02:22.200> or<00:02:22.410> the<00:02:22.530> 9.4<00:02:23.599> but<00:02:24.599> now

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
sell more than 10.1 or the 9.4 but now

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.130 
sell more than 10.1 or the 9.4 but now
night<00:02:25.140> 10.1<00:02:26.010> is<00:02:26.670> a<00:02:26.730> little<00:02:27.450> bit<00:02:27.629> more<00:02:27.930> than

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
night 10.1 is a little bit more than

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.759 
night 10.1 is a little bit more than
this<00:02:28.260> one<00:02:29.599> the<00:02:30.599> price<00:02:30.840> or<00:02:31.080> what<00:02:31.379> you<00:02:31.440> mean<00:02:31.590> if
