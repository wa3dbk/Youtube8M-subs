00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.310 
used say a cotton bias tape with a knit
it<00:00:20.430> would<00:00:20.640> look<00:00:20.760> kind<00:00:21.060> of<00:00:21.150> weird<00:00:21.359> I<00:00:21.750> mean<00:00:22.020> maybe

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
it would look kind of weird I mean maybe

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.970 
it would look kind of weird I mean maybe
not<00:00:22.439> but<00:00:22.980> it<00:00:23.789> might<00:00:23.960> it<00:00:24.960> probably<00:00:25.439> would<00:00:25.619> but

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
not but it might it probably would but

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
maybe not so this is good for knits it's

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
between your fold over elastic just

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.880 
between your fold over elastic just
sandwich<00:02:47.880> it<00:02:48.030> in<00:02:48.120> there<00:02:50.120> catching<00:02:51.120> anything

put it and which it in between just like
a<00:03:04.020> bias<00:03:04.350> paper<00:03:04.770> yeah<00:03:05.160> and<00:03:05.760> then<00:03:06.320> set<00:03:07.320> your

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
a bias paper yeah and then set your

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:13.280 
a bias paper yeah and then set your
machine<00:03:07.890> to<00:03:10.700> I'm<00:03:11.700> setting<00:03:12.240> mine<00:03:12.390> to<00:03:12.630> five<00:03:12.870> and

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
machine to I'm setting mine to five and

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.100 
machine to I'm setting mine to five and
five<00:03:13.590> is<00:03:14.280> best<00:03:14.670> because<00:03:15.120> it<00:03:15.570> does<00:03:15.750> three

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
five is best because it does three

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.949 
five is best because it does three
stitches<00:03:16.440> for<00:03:16.920> every<00:03:17.310> peak<00:03:17.640> and<00:03:17.970> that<00:03:18.750> way

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
stitches for every peak and that way

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.260 
stitches for every peak and that way
it's<00:03:19.230> definitely<00:03:19.860> going<00:03:20.160> to<00:03:20.430> catch<00:03:20.880> the

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
it's definitely going to catch the

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.750 
it's definitely going to catch the
fabric<00:03:21.810> that<00:03:22.470> you<00:03:22.650> have<00:03:22.680> sandwiched<00:03:23.430> in

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
fabric that you have sandwiched in

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.430 
fabric that you have sandwiched in
between<00:03:23.959> the<00:03:24.959> fold<00:03:25.170> over<00:03:25.380> elastic<00:03:26.930> the<00:03:27.930> on<00:03:28.140> the

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
between the fold over elastic the on the

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.960 
between the fold over elastic the on the
trick<00:03:28.709> to<00:03:29.220> pull<00:03:29.850> over<00:03:30.030> lastik<00:03:30.780> is<00:03:31.160> not<00:03:32.160> to<00:03:32.790> let

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
trick to pull over lastik is not to let

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.460 
trick to pull over lastik is not to let
this<00:03:33.540> come<00:03:34.500> outside<00:03:35.160> of<00:03:35.630> the<00:03:36.630> full<00:03:36.810> of<00:03:36.959> elastic

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
this come outside of the full of elastic

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.949 
this come outside of the full of elastic
like<00:03:37.620> this<00:03:37.830> it<00:03:38.550> has<00:03:38.850> to<00:03:38.880> be<00:03:39.209> sandwiched<00:03:39.570> in

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
like this it has to be sandwiched in

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.710 
like this it has to be sandwiched in
between<00:03:39.989> and<00:03:40.709> that<00:03:40.850> can<00:03:41.850> be<00:03:41.940> trickier<00:03:42.600> than

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
between and that can be trickier than

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.080 
between and that can be trickier than
you<00:03:42.959> may<00:03:43.170> think<00:03:43.430> because<00:03:44.430> you<00:03:44.580> have<00:03:44.730> to<00:03:44.850> pull

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
you may think because you have to pull

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:51.650 
you may think because you have to pull
this<00:03:45.270> at<00:03:45.810> the<00:03:45.989> same<00:03:46.200> time<00:03:47.000> okay<00:03:49.730> and<00:03:50.730> you're

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
this at the same time okay and you're

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:52.820 
this at the same time okay and you're
going<00:03:51.780> to<00:03:51.810> sandwich<00:03:52.110> it<00:03:52.200> in<00:03:52.470> between<00:03:52.620> the

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
going to sandwich it in between the

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.260 
going to sandwich it in between the
elastic<00:03:53.370> and<00:03:53.489> you're<00:03:53.610> going<00:03:53.730> to<00:03:53.790> pull<00:03:54.090> the

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.270 
elastic and you're going to pull the

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.449 
elastic and you're going to pull the
elastic<00:03:54.510> now<00:03:55.290> how<00:03:55.560> much<00:03:55.709> you<00:03:55.770> pull<00:03:56.100> it<00:03:56.220> is<00:03:56.340> up

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
elastic now how much you pull it is up

elastic now how much you pull it is up
to<00:03:56.640> you<00:03:56.820> I<00:03:57.060> like<00:03:57.660> to<00:03:57.690> pull<00:03:57.959> it<00:03:58.080> as<00:03:58.290> tight<00:03:58.320> as<00:03:58.620> I

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
to you I like to pull it as tight as I

to you I like to pull it as tight as I
possibly<00:03:59.400> can<00:03:59.700> so<00:04:03.080> sandwich<00:04:04.080> it<00:04:04.230> in<00:04:04.350> between

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:14.300

want it to you're going to be pulling
this<00:04:22.590> at<00:04:22.890> the<00:04:23.400> same<00:04:23.610> time<00:04:24.530> and<00:04:25.530> it's<00:04:25.740> going<00:04:25.950> to

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
this at the same time and it's going to

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.130 
this at the same time and it's going to
want<00:04:26.280> to<00:04:26.430> pull<00:04:27.000> the<00:04:27.120> fabric<00:04:27.300> forward<00:04:27.960> and

it doesn't go forward I'll continue
stitching<00:04:35.820> down<00:04:36.180> and<00:04:36.870> then<00:04:37.110> when<00:04:37.230> you<00:04:37.320> get<00:04:37.440> to

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:10.290 
because it might just pull out of

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:29.139 
because it might just pull out of
underneath<00:05:10.860> the<00:05:11.070> foot<00:05:11.720> hope<00:05:12.720> you<00:05:12.840> don't
