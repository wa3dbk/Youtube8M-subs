00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.850
 hello everyone I'm sheriff and today we're 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:07.279
 in the factory battle in pokémon edition 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:10.309
 platinum to face the ace of the 

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:11.780
 front battle as he is telling us 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:14.030
 girl this is the one that allows us 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.349
 exchange our pokémon because the 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.960
 Battle factory are battles 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:21.320
 Individuals of 3 against 3 in which you 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:25.730
 they lend you pokemon at the beginning you can 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:27.260
 choose but in 37 pokemon you take 3 and with 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.090
 You are fighting and at the end of each 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.000
 combat you can choose to change one of the 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:34.130
 what do you have for any of the pokemon of 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.510
 rival that you just defeated 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.120
 and so is the battle factory so 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:42.730
 now let's face the leader 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:48.170
 sorry to the manufacturer the boss 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:50.060
 well we proceed forward that already denise 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.829
 a wii dance with the shortcut movement a 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:56.570
 brightness 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:58.190
 Well, I'm going to show you my team and we're going to 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.379
 give you a drink 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.500
 we're not going to let him have flamethrowers 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.390
 so it's perfect for us then what 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.659
 will have some ice attack now that 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.659
 I think it 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:14.560
 we have a day two with angry waterfall 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:17.170
 Philadelphia impact rock and a kart dewar 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:20.470
 or it was an ice attack is that we 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.180
 it bothers pretty let's see if we leave 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.840
 to the dragon knight for some pokemon that 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:28.520
 can against the we bayle of our 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.340
 none is this the perfect ice 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:34.750
 you want to sing to the exchange if more than 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:42.590
 luck in this element 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:44.260
 or something like that because obviously it's not going to 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:48.630
 fail 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:52.159
 and what happened and has appeared there if it says 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.380
 quiet nothing happens come 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.260
 another way he declared equally in the 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.960
 rows of the flock 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.659
 and 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.960
 I'm my team now, well, let's go 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.510
 against the end 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.600
 a name a little weird for a 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:11.140
 person 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:14.620
 but hey wii going is going to be a 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:17.350
 problem in this dance moves the exerce 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.120
 pressure let's see if it's strong 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.180
 fist ice we will not hold it 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.840
 surely 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.260
 Let's see 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:30.239
 nothing out that penalties 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.239
 I think we're going to take out guiding two 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.850
 with intimidation and let's make a rock 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:40.190
 sharpener year 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.190
 very well resists them well and the spirits 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:47.500
 well and we hit on sharp clothes 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:51.120
 I hope you do not have something as a band 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:53.940
 focus because if not from the lost 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.020
 well we killed something and dance to see 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.770
 what are we getting out of now 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.470
 a york rider 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:05.330
 well 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:07.520
 in principle we should kill him since 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.230
 they are very well effective by four without 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.460
 more physical and has good 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.460
 defenses let's see what happens 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.190
 we killed him well a critic because you 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.480
 annoyances and memories of a critic to the 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.380
 I care about winning as critics in the 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:27.490
 sector game 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:30.450
 the law is what the polygon effect it 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:33.560
 let's make an anger come there 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.560
 the last 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.890
 but when we take it away, come on, you're still gone 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.750
 going down do not keep going down keep going down 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:43.510
 ok well that's a critic this is a 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:46.320

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:49.810
