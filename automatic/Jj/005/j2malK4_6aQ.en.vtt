00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
terminex worked pretty well while I was

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.699 
terminex worked pretty well while I was
there<00:02:35.959> might<00:02:36.530> as<00:02:36.620> well<00:02:36.709> grab<00:02:36.859> some<00:02:37.069> wd-40<00:02:38.709> so

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
there might as well grab some wd-40 so

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:41.500 
there might as well grab some wd-40 so
with<00:02:39.859> the<00:02:39.980> terminex<00:02:40.430> all<00:02:40.670> I<00:02:40.700> had<00:02:40.910> to<00:02:41.030> do<00:02:41.209> was

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
with the terminex all I had to do was

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.080 
with the terminex all I had to do was
spray<00:02:41.900> the<00:02:42.109> area<00:02:42.500> let<00:02:43.340> it<00:02:43.459> sit<00:02:43.700> for<00:02:43.730> about<00:02:44.060> a

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
spray the area let it sit for about a

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.059 
spray the area let it sit for about a
minute<00:02:44.329> and<00:02:44.660> then<00:02:44.870> spray<00:02:45.349> it<00:02:45.440> off<00:02:45.590> again<00:02:45.920> with

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
minute and then spray it off again with

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:52.240 
minute and then spray it off again with
water<00:02:46.310> I<00:02:49.299> was<00:02:50.299> skeptical<00:02:50.900> but<00:02:51.169> I<00:02:51.440> was<00:02:51.919> able<00:02:52.220> to

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
water I was skeptical but I was able to

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.520 
water I was skeptical but I was able to
remove<00:02:52.669> much<00:02:53.060> of<00:02:53.269> the<00:02:53.450> adhesive<00:02:53.810> pretty

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
remove much of the adhesive pretty

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:55.900

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
easily after that with just my

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:03.370 
easily after that with just my
fingernails<00:02:56.480> I<00:03:01.180> did<00:03:02.180> have<00:03:02.359> to<00:03:02.480> do<00:03:02.630> it<00:03:02.810> two<00:03:03.349> or

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
fingernails I did have to do it two or

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.470 
fingernails I did have to do it two or
three<00:03:03.530> times<00:03:03.739> but<00:03:04.340> eventually<00:03:04.669> it<00:03:05.030> was<00:03:05.150> all

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
three times but eventually it was all

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.390 
three times but eventually it was all
clean<00:03:05.870> and<00:03:06.049> by<00:03:06.739> that<00:03:06.950> I<00:03:06.980> mean<00:03:07.220> clean<00:03:07.519> enough<00:03:07.790> I

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
clean and by that I mean clean enough I

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.220 
clean and by that I mean clean enough I
definitely<00:03:10.400> recommend<00:03:10.700> removing<00:03:11.329> the<00:03:11.450> inside
