sentence<00:01:02.300> feel<00:01:02.960> that<00:01:03.170> it's<00:01:03.320> definitely<00:01:03.680> part

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
sentence feel that it's definitely part

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.770 
sentence feel that it's definitely part
of<00:01:04.339> the<00:01:04.430> pathway<00:01:04.940> where<00:01:05.119> you<00:01:05.239> can<00:01:05.420> make<00:01:05.600> it

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
of the pathway where you can make it

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.540 
of the pathway where you can make it
into<00:01:06.050> the<00:01:06.140> professional<00:01:06.590> ranks<00:01:06.770> so<00:01:07.400> I<00:01:07.430> think

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:07.550 
into the professional ranks so I think

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.200 
into the professional ranks so I think
we<00:01:07.759> went<00:01:07.970> away<00:01:08.030> from<00:01:08.390> that<00:01:09.789> maybe<00:01:10.789> in<00:01:10.940> the<00:01:11.000> last

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
we went away from that maybe in the last

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.120 
we went away from that maybe in the last
10<00:01:11.450> years<00:01:11.660> or<00:01:11.869> so<00:01:11.930> I<00:01:12.350> think<00:01:12.740> that<00:01:12.890> was<00:01:13.100> a

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
10 years or so I think that was a

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.800 
10 years or so I think that was a
mistake<00:01:13.280> on<00:01:13.729> our<00:01:13.789> part<00:01:13.940> and<00:01:14.330> I<00:01:14.420> think<00:01:14.630> that<00:01:14.780> is

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
mistake on our part and I think that is

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.630 
mistake on our part and I think that is
great<00:01:15.229> to<00:01:15.530> see<00:01:15.680> some<00:01:15.890> really<00:01:16.250> good<00:01:16.369> young
