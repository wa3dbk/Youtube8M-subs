00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:08.250
 mister doctor of armenia and first night 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.219
 effect in business hotels so we talk 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.980
 about that always taken that way in the basics 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.650
 the first look or even in the 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.900
 bed if you are there that is the first 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.480
 then you have contact with the 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.340
 environment can be very different 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.470
 especially in the sleep so you know 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.160
 that yes that in hotels very much 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.320
 uncomfortable sleeping often robs you of a quasi 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.680
 even the sleep is there 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.140
 So this first night effect like 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.210
 one is designated of course in the 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.540
 sleep medicine well known so if 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.280
 man a ladder a two nights im 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.379
 to spend sleep laboratory 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.719
 then you realize that you actually 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.160
 the results of the first night 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.260
 usually can not use at all 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.360
 and that's why they say this first night 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.640
 effect that leads to the people are 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.590
 Excited they have another 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.539
 sleeping environment they have another one 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.820
 bed another mattresses other 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.070
 Cushions do not have the cover too 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.140
 they have at home and that leads to 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.270
 a restless sleep that actually 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.100
 is not representative and the 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.170
 not really because it was there again 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.850
 it's actually for sleep medicine 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.530
 important who can of course very much 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.810
 be tedious of course my next 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.700
 days rather important date has somewhere 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.920
 So that could also be a problem 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.080
 He performs exactly as it is in the hotel 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.119
 of course just like that and we have that in 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.060
 their contributions already spoken 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.790
 I have in front of 15 20 years, the 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.280
 first measurements made in hotels and 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.590
 I have analyzed the sleep asleep 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.780
 you're in hotels and that's in there 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.540
 usually not much changed and 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.460
 This is especially in the business hotel 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.320
 given in the first night effect 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.360
 Wellness hotel a little less because im 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.250
 wellnesshotel there goes to the topic of wellness 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.350
 and there I go with one 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.820
 certain other expectations in the 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.530
 Wellnesshotel because I want me there 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.869
 determined I want to relax 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.790
 I meet funny people there I have 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.430
 a good mood but if I am 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.439
 I'm on a business trip 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.969
 a stressful arrival and that comes 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.489
 maybe also where it really is 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.110
 important things have to be done 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.220
 maybe an order to land 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.110
 and so on 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.480
 then of course it is clear when I am in the 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.910
 night of a meeting bad sleep 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.470
 then it can be catastrophic 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.880
 impact so we have already 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.740
 but you should talk straight 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.240
 even when arriving the whole way 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.550
 consider that you are not in the 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.500
 Stress phase comes or long unpleasant 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.400
 has arrived but simply still plan 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.440
 of course, that's the sense of it 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.810
 truisms that we all know 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.900
 but that I live the lives in 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.670
 rain on that and we know today 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.920
 especially if you are by car or in the 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.170
 airplane on the way you can stress you 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.780
 usually not easy in the bag 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:52.709
 stuck and there are always situations 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:54.810
 that occur and that is the way of the 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.670
 civilization people we have each 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.780
 day new challenges for now 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.790
 we have to face each other 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.970
 because some left better the other 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.130
 less but as I said in the hotel it is 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.560
 just so there's the psychological 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:10.500
 factors play a big role 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.600
 the unfamiliar mattresses then lead to 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.810
 a bad sleep and most 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:18.000
 Mattresses in the hotel are indeed in people 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.700
 that are good in the business, I say 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.530
 worse than the ones the people too 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.780
 home next to the unfamiliar 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.300
 Situation if you are in a hotel 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.670
 is precisely the also the one can 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.769
 clearly say that the quality of course 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.450
 The beds are not necessarily the best 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:35.730
 there they have developed something yes 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:39.239
 maybe just today is in the 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:43.140
 morgenmagazin I just happened to 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:46.110
 turned on interesting reportage 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.970
 come over the vacation behavior and 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.799
 but it is especially about the Germans 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:53.190
 guests have gone and the Germans are yes 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:55.230
 as you know, very fanatical vacationers 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.790
 Do everything with it so your year 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.940
 were able to do objectively and there time 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:03.330
 a question what is on holiday on vacation 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:05.310
 Most off yes and the answer was to 100 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.209
 percent the bed your own bed 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.310
 own mattress 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:10.230
 So you actually already see or 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.720
 that for the people completely one 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.459
 important point and therefore becomes 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.070
 of course in the future that in the 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:19.169
 hotels will be a theme and the 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.000
 So hotels will become more and more in the future 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:23.150
 you have to take care of one of them 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.190
 most famous sentences is the moment 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.780
 a habitual animal that you can too 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.280
 say but you have your own concept 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.060
 evolved that we talk about that 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.340
 can 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:34.160
 for the first night effect power 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.620
 sleeping rooms totally incomparable me 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.729
 have turned this first night effect 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.729
 into the positive 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:44.780
 So that means a special conception 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:46.639
 for hotels under the name power 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.580
 sleeping rooms so that's sleep 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:51.710
 biologically optimized hotel rooms or 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.810
 offer hotels and there it goes again 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:56.240
 the same things bedstead 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:58.360
 sleeping system sleeping room 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:01.639
 exactly these basic requirements 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:04.580
 Of course, this trio is in the hotel 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:06.380
 also important and this sleep biological 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.900
 Optimized hotel rooms next door 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:11.060
 the positive first night effect that 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.050
 you really good from the first to the first 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.389
 can sleep 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:18.380
 That's a thousand times proven we have 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:20.150
 Over 2000 hotel sleeps already 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:21.800
 sleep biologically optimized and then 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.440
 we get to run this 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:27.229
 Feedback and we started in 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:29.630
 the wellness hotels and start now 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:31.340
 step by step the business hotels 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.900
 from my point of view even if you 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.460
 that a bit business 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.050
 are even more important than that 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:39.650
 wellness hotels and the feel-good factor 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:40.970
 or promote healthy sleep 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.400
 Of course, the success then the next 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:45.380
 day because you have to schedule thus 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.389
 the words live well when he is 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:49.280
 ensures that the success on the 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:51.020
 next day , so to speak 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:54.740
 that would close the circle 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:57.710
 because one of the ur tasks of a hotel 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:58.340
 is it just for a cap good sleep 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.320
 to care 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.880
 that's really nice words just 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.199
 sleep well dot com is like that 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.389
 successful portal 

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:07.130
 there you can read it for a while 

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:08.960
 you also sleep tv 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:11.240
 come and you can also download 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:13.550
 exactly so you can download the book 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:16.370
 and you can be as well at a flat 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:18.830
 coaching participants a couple of times on that 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:20.720
 portal click into all these things 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:22.639
 listed and when we are at 

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.020
 theme of the power sleeping rooms are here 

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:25.699
 You can also google sleep soundly 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:28.880
 There you will find the hotel as well 

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:30.409
 Exactly so if you're on the road is worthwhile 

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.840
 it always looks to see if maybe 

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:34.930
 near the hotel is the 90th 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.340
 kilometer to continue 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:37.509
 because the probability is very high 

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:39.880
 I'm high the next day 

00:06:37.509 --> 00:06:41.410
 I am well rested 

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:43.810
 should only the successful date there 

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:47.729
 just not for sleeping so it looks as 

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:47.729
 thanks for the interesting topic
