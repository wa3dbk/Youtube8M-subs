looking<00:00:32.669> for<00:00:32.700> female<00:00:33.120> I<00:00:33.450> thought<00:00:34.110> that<00:00:34.200> was

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
looking for female I thought that was

I'll tell you what it is

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.470 
I'll tell you what it is
now<00:00:50.250> he's<00:00:50.550> going<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.789> rule<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.059> world<00:00:51.090> of

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
now he's going to rule the world of

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.810 
now he's going to rule the world of
course<00:00:51.750> by<00:00:52.710> killing<00:00:53.070> all<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.280> humans<00:00:53.640> on<00:00:53.730> this

island they controlling the gijin who
remain<00:00:55.500> I<00:00:55.530> will<00:00:55.800> turn<00:00:55.949> this<00:00:56.039> country<00:00:56.250> into

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
remain I will turn this country into

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.920 
remain I will turn this country into
those<00:00:56.670> powerful<00:00:57.059> war<00:00:57.360> machine<00:00:57.750> in<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:57.989> world

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930

something<00:01:00.930> about<00:01:01.079> that<00:01:01.170> plan

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
something about that plan

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.940 
something about that plan
doesn't<00:01:02.309> really<00:01:02.690> seem<00:01:03.690> like<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:03.930> fits<00:01:06.950> model

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
doesn't really seem like it fits model

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.050 
doesn't really seem like it fits model
for<00:01:08.159> six<00:01:08.430> for<00:01:08.670> six

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
for six for six

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.480

oh<00:01:10.670> come<00:01:11.670> on<00:01:11.790> Pino<00:01:12.180> circuit<00:01:12.689> J<00:01:13.100> it'll<00:01:14.100> save<00:01:14.340> you

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
oh come on Pino circuit J it'll save you

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.899 
oh come on Pino circuit J it'll save you
I<00:01:14.700> know<00:01:14.850> it

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:18.909 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:28.970 

get<00:01:19.600> up

he<00:01:37.190> was<00:01:37.310> supposed<00:01:37.610> to<00:01:38.440> but<00:01:39.440> Circuit<00:01:39.860> J

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:44.650 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.910 

how<00:01:45.220> could

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:15.570 

Pino<00:02:09.770> oh<00:02:11.920> and<00:02:12.920> Messel<00:02:13.610> is<00:02:13.700> still<00:02:13.910> around<00:02:14.150> and

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
Pino oh and Messel is still around and

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.980 
Pino oh and Messel is still around and
now<00:02:16.580> we<00:02:16.640> don't<00:02:16.760> have<00:02:16.880> Circuit<00:02:17.300> J<00:02:17.510> on<00:02:17.660> our<00:02:17.780> side

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
now we don't have Circuit J on our side

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:26.640 
now we don't have Circuit J on our side
anymore<00:02:18.020> because<00:02:18.530> Pinos<00:02:18.980> been<00:02:19.250> killed

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.430 

and

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.530 

while<00:02:30.160> that<00:02:30.520> is<00:02:30.670> a<00:02:30.700> big<00:02:31.180> warship<00:02:31.810> I<00:02:33.420> think<00:02:34.420> it's

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
while that is a big warship I think it's

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.180 
while that is a big warship I think it's
safe<00:02:34.690> to<00:02:34.810> say<00:02:34.870> that<00:02:35.230> we're<00:02:35.860> pretty<00:02:35.980> much

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
safe to say that we're pretty much

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:42.589 
safe to say that we're pretty much
screwed

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.839 

hahahaha<00:02:43.629> can<00:02:43.989> you<00:02:44.110> hear<00:02:44.349> me<00:02:44.640> you<00:02:45.640> don't<00:02:45.819> think

hahahaha can you hear me you don't think

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:46.949 
hahahaha can you hear me you don't think
I'd<00:02:46.000> run<00:02:46.180> away<00:02:46.269> just<00:02:46.599> because<00:02:46.659> of<00:02:46.780> a<00:02:46.930> few

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
I'd run away just because of a few

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:53.620 
I'd run away just because of a few
setbacks<00:02:47.439> now<00:02:47.890> do<00:02:47.950> you
