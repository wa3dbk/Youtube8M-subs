00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.929
 you already lost sharing with you and they are 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:05.929
 children 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:11.790
 with saints oils and humanistic shared 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:16.260
 nothing with you 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:18.630
 japan is not tokyo recently I'm 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.670
 talking with foreign friends who 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.750
 they live here in tokyo and in different 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:27.180
 parts of Japan we meet in a bar and 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:30.210
 two of my friends one lives in nigata and 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.759
 the other one here commented that the 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.100
 that we live in Tokyo really do not 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.100
 we know the real japan since 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.680
 Tokyo for being a metropolis is more 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.350
 exposed and influenced by the west 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.440
 and it really does not reflect what Japan is 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.330
 since people in Tokyo and life in 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.430
 Tokyo is very different from the rest 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:53.700
 of the country and good is what they 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:57.329
 they commented and I agree that the 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:59.720
 People in Tokyo are more open and it is common 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:03.750
 that many foreigners come to work 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:05.100
 for a season a few years and just go 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.500
 to places where there is a large 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.110
 concentration of foreigners during their 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.140
 Stay here in Tokyo and do not immerse yourself 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.810
 really to culture and I agree that 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.450
 just living in Tokyo will not show you everything 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.730
 what is going cultural of this country and 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.680
 that life in Tokyo 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:26.220
 or in other big cities like a 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.190
 Goya or Xhaka is very different from life 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.380
 which is carried in places with a style of 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:34.470
 quieter life and where almost no 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.110
 they see foreigners but even if Tokyo is 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.810
 a large metropolis with influences 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.760
 from abroad today and the people here in 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.240
 Tokyo is more open 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:47.850
 this is also japanese maybe not what 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.670
 more representative but the people who have 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.130
 grown in Tokyo is also Japanese and 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.260
 it is still preserving the core of the 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.510
 essence of Japanese culture in 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.730
 big cities like tokyo those that 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.550
 we live in tokyo we also know about the 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.830
 life in japan and I agree that such 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.920
 there are many foreigners of many 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.720
 other countries that only stay in their 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.350
 life circle of foreigners in their 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:16.320
 Stay here in Tokyo and nex not explore 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.780
 beyond culture but everything depends 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.790
 the person we are all different and 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.520
 I know foreigners who have lived for 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.380
 many years in Tokyo and they are submerged 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.640
 in Japanese culture and in many 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.870
 activities that 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.790
 It gives them the opportunity to have the 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.150
 experience of knowing the culture 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.220
 Japanese in a deeper way not 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.350
 look with the impression that the rest 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.540
 of Japanese as Tokyo and that the 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.480
 experiences of those who live in Tokyo 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.000
 or large gums will be equal to that of 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:49.110
 rest of japan from other places in japan 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.250
 but tokyo is also Japanese is not what 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.100
 most representative of culture 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.080
 Japanese but this is a city so 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.730
 interesting because despite all the 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.030
 influence and changes that this 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:02.489
 city the people the city follow 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.800
 conserving their customs and the core 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.900
 of their culture foreigners who 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.790
 We live in Tokyo or its surroundings 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.310
 we also have the opportunity to 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.530
 know what life is like in Japan all 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.209
 It depends on each person and interest in 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.450
 know and ccoo and immerse yourself in your 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:21.150
 culture japan has many profiles that 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.310
 point in the same direction and those that 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.070
 we live in tokyo or large entities 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.080
 we can also show you one of these 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.989
 profiles that in the end also form 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.940
 part of the culture and life of japan 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:35.760
 Japan is not Tokyo but 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:38.400
 Tokyo is also Japan, this is all for 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.800
 tonight thanks for joining me 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:47.150
