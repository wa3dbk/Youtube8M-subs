importance is is the basis of course the
highest<00:01:46.520> and<00:01:46.820> then<00:01:47.810> it<00:01:47.929> goes<00:01:48.140> down<00:01:48.170> from<00:01:48.590> there

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
highest and then it goes down from there

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.499 
highest and then it goes down from there
so<00:01:49.039> that<00:01:49.070> the<00:01:50.170> if<00:01:51.170> you<00:01:51.289> look<00:01:51.469> back<00:01:51.740> here<00:01:52.270> ace<00:01:53.270> of

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 
so that the if you look back here ace of

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:58.510 
so that the if you look back here ace of
spades<00:01:53.840> was<00:01:54.770> Saddam<00:01:55.429> Hussein<00:01:55.850> and<00:01:57.399> so<00:01:58.399> the

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
spades was Saddam Hussein and so the

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.830
