00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
feeling that there's a war one had and

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.860 
feeling that there's a war one had and
even<00:03:54.070> though<00:03:54.430> girls<00:03:54.670> were<00:03:54.820> 2<00:03:55.060> &amp;<00:03:55.270> 3<00:03:55.300> were<00:03:55.600> really

even though girls were 2 &amp; 3 were really

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.930 
even though girls were 2 &amp; 3 were really
awesome<00:03:56.050> it<00:03:56.830> didn't<00:03:57.070> really<00:03:57.190> have<00:03:57.490> that<00:03:57.520> type

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
awesome it didn't really have that type

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.210 
awesome it didn't really have that type
of<00:03:57.970> eeriness<00:03:58.600> to<00:03:58.810> it<00:03:58.930> the<00:03:59.440> only<00:03:59.620> part<00:04:00.010> I<00:04:00.100> can

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
of eeriness to it the only part I can

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:01.860 
of eeriness to it the only part I can
really<00:04:00.400> think<00:04:00.550> of<00:04:00.730> that<00:04:00.910> had<00:04:01.180> really<00:04:01.540> crazy

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
really think of that had really crazy

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.830 
really think of that had really crazy
airiness<00:04:02.440> was<00:04:03.010> in<00:04:03.160> Gears<00:04:03.340> -<00:04:03.580> when<00:04:03.850> you<00:04:03.970> saw<00:04:04.210> the

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
airiness was in Gears - when you saw the

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.780 
airiness was in Gears - when you saw the
Shires<00:04:05.140> or<00:04:05.500> like<00:04:05.680> the<00:04:05.800> part<00:04:06.040> when<00:04:06.220> the<00:04:06.520> people

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
Shires or like the part when the people

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.850 
Shires or like the part when the people
were<00:04:07.000> being<00:04:07.210> tortured<00:04:07.630> and<00:04:07.810> stuff<00:04:08.050> those<00:04:08.680> are

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
were being tortured and stuff those are

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.740 
were being tortured and stuff those are
probably<00:04:09.220> like<00:04:09.430> the<00:04:09.610> only<00:04:09.850> major<00:04:10.030> scenes<00:04:10.510> that

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
probably like the only major scenes that

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.930 
probably like the only major scenes that
really<00:04:11.020> had<00:04:11.530> a<00:04:11.560> really<00:04:11.890> dark<00:04:12.130> eerie<00:04:12.460> tone<00:04:12.730> to

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
really had a really dark eerie tone to

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.610 
really had a really dark eerie tone to
it<00:04:12.970> because<00:04:13.600> there<00:04:13.720> were<00:04:13.810> three<00:04:13.990> kind<00:04:14.530> of

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
it because there were three kind of

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.080 
it because there were three kind of
liked<00:04:14.800> it<00:04:14.980> too<00:04:15.160> because<00:04:15.370> Gears<00:04:15.730> of<00:04:15.790> War<00:04:15.850> 3

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
liked it too because Gears of War 3

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:17.760 
liked it too because Gears of War 3
didn't<00:04:16.270> really<00:04:16.450> have<00:04:16.600> anything<00:04:16.810> too<00:04:17.230> bad

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:17.770

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
and dark and eerie tone I keep coming

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.260 
and dark and eerie tone I keep coming
back<00:04:26.620> to<00:04:26.800> that<00:04:27.100> because<00:04:27.280> as

horrible<00:04:32.379> dark<00:04:32.889> and<00:04:33.099> feeling<00:04:33.849> of<00:04:33.940> desperation

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
horrible dark and feeling of desperation

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.839 
horrible dark and feeling of desperation
and<00:04:34.960> hopelessness<00:04:35.530> that<00:04:36.009> the<00:04:36.250> locusts<00:04:36.610> gave

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:36.849 
and hopelessness that the locusts gave

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:39.510 
and hopelessness that the locusts gave
the<00:04:37.030> humans<00:04:37.419> and<00:04:37.629> during<00:04:37.990> the<00:04:38.139> war<00:04:38.379> only<00:04:39.159> one

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
the humans and during the war only one

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.300 
the humans and during the war only one
year<00:04:39.759> after<00:04:39.819> EJ<00:04:40.629> and<00:04:40.870> the<00:04:41.319> huge<00:04:41.560> world<00:04:42.069> war

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
year after EJ and the huge world war

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.339 
year after EJ and the huge world war
killed<00:04:42.759> most<00:04:43.060> of<00:04:43.180> the<00:04:43.270> humans<00:04:43.599> and<00:04:43.810> was

00:04:44.339 --> 00:04:44.349 
killed most of the humans and was

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:46.860 
killed most of the humans and was
pushing<00:04:44.650> humans<00:04:45.520> to<00:04:45.669> this<00:04:45.819> huge<00:04:46.120> horrible

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
pushing humans to this huge horrible

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.689 
pushing humans to this huge horrible
sense<00:04:47.289> of<00:04:47.440> desperation<00:04:47.620> that<00:04:48.159> caused<00:04:48.430> him<00:04:48.669> to

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:48.699 
sense of desperation that caused him to

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:51.210 
sense of desperation that caused him to
use<00:04:49.000> the<00:04:49.120> hammer<00:04:49.300> of<00:04:49.419> dawn<00:04:49.509> in<00:04:50.080> pretty<00:04:50.889> much<00:04:51.069> to

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
use the hammer of dawn in pretty much to

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.710 
use the hammer of dawn in pretty much to
kill<00:04:51.340> a<00:04:51.400> huge<00:04:51.669> portion<00:04:51.970> of<00:04:52.180> the<00:04:52.240> human<00:04:52.419> race

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
kill a huge portion of the human race

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.649 
kill a huge portion of the human race
that<00:04:52.780> was<00:04:53.139> still<00:04:53.409> barely<00:04:53.770> surviving<00:04:54.159> and<00:04:55.120> they

00:04:55.649 --> 00:04:55.659 
that was still barely surviving and they

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:57.210 
that was still barely surviving and they
could<00:04:55.840> really<00:04:55.960> expand<00:04:56.500> upon<00:04:56.740> that<00:04:56.979> they

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
could really expand upon that they

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.969 
could really expand upon that they
really<00:04:57.550> can't<00:04:57.819> they<00:04:57.970> really<00:04:58.240> can<00:04:58.449> show<00:04:59.139> how

00:04:59.969 --> 00:04:59.979 
really can't they really can show how

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:02.189 
really can't they really can show how
bad<00:05:00.280> the<00:05:00.520> locusts<00:05:00.849> are<00:05:01.120> you<00:05:01.599> know<00:05:01.750> the<00:05:01.870> locusts

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:02.199 
bad the locusts are you know the locusts

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:04.409 
bad the locusts are you know the locusts
that's<00:05:02.590> why<00:05:02.770> they<00:05:02.979> got<00:05:03.190> their<00:05:03.460> name<00:05:03.789> because

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:04.419 
that's why they got their name because

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:06.540 
that's why they got their name because
they<00:05:04.750> were<00:05:04.810> so<00:05:05.139> powerful<00:05:05.440> that<00:05:05.740> it<00:05:05.979> was<00:05:06.130> the

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
they were so powerful that it was the

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.719 
they were so powerful that it was the
equivalent<00:05:06.849> of<00:05:07.240> a<00:05:07.960> locust<00:05:08.500> swarm<00:05:08.860> killing

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:09.729 
equivalent of a locust swarm killing

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:11.309 
equivalent of a locust swarm killing
everything<00:05:10.000> you<00:05:10.599> know<00:05:10.750> back<00:05:10.960> in<00:05:10.990> ancient

00:05:11.309 --> 00:05:11.319 
everything you know back in ancient

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:13.620 
everything you know back in ancient
times<00:05:11.710> when<00:05:11.949> the<00:05:12.099> locusts<00:05:12.430> would<00:05:12.610> kill<00:05:12.970> you

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
times when the locusts would kill you

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.149 
times when the locusts would kill you
know<00:05:13.750> people<00:05:14.110> or<00:05:14.289> plants<00:05:14.680> or<00:05:14.770> whatever<00:05:14.979> that
