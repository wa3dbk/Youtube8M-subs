and grow it the next year it will be the
exact<00:00:44.969> same<00:00:45.090> tomato<00:00:45.600> almost<00:00:46.050> like<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.260> clone<00:00:46.680> if

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
exact same tomato almost like a clone if

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.430 
exact same tomato almost like a clone if
you<00:00:47.730> save<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.149> seed<00:00:48.360> from<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.690> hybrid<00:00:49.200> tomato

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440

you save the seed from a hybrid tomato
you<00:00:50.219> will<00:00:50.430> not<00:00:50.640> necessarily<00:00:50.910> get<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.840> same

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170
