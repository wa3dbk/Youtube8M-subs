00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.730
 hello this time we will talk to 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.500
 you about the children's compressor nebulizers 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.719
 from the company Dr. Fry 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.030
 with such wonderful ones 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.000
 pictures 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:17.369
 it's called a little rain and this one 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.380
 the inhaler is no different 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.840
 it can be used for 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.570
 inhalation treatment as adults 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.140
 such after all and but especially he will like it 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.599
 for children 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:31.080
 because it is distinguished by its bright and 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:34.010
 unusual design a child can himself 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.530
 decorate your nebulizer with these 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.570
 adhesive pictures to collect and 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.960
 prepare the nebulizer to work very 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.620
 just first you need to pour the medicine into 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.620
 sprayer and 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:53.140
 which is calculated to 10 milliliters 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:56.180
 medicinal product 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:59.450
 connect the air to either end 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:03.950
 compressor hose and sprayer 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:06.670
 and we put on the necessary attachment for example 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:09.670
 we connect the child mask to the outlet and 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.670
 turn on 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.909
 the inhaler has a built-in 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:23.320
 fuse that turns off the device 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:25.990
 at overheating 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.840
 but it is important to know that during inhalation it is impossible 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.729
 use oil solutions 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.560
 the nebulizer is not designed for their use 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.390
 many ask how correctly 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.210
 disinfect 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:40.210
 inhaler I am somewhere very simple 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:43.299
 enough to handle it 3 percent 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:46.119
 hydrogen peroxide solution and up to 70 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:49.000
 percent alcohol after which it is needed 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:51.340
 rinse with warm water but worth remembering 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.220
 you can never boil 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:57.509
 of the nozzles in the kit includes two masks 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:00.640
 adult and child him that in yard 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:03.310
