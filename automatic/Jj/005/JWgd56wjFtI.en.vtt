in<00:00:01.920> this<00:00:02.100> video<00:00:02.280> I<00:00:02.460> will<00:00:02.639> explain<00:00:02.820> how<00:00:03.629> you<00:00:03.689> can

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
in this video I will explain how you can

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.460 
in this video I will explain how you can
use<00:00:04.950> the<00:00:05.279> reporting<00:00:06.150> function<00:00:06.660> in

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
use the reporting function in

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.620 
use the reporting function in
combination<00:00:08.040> with<00:00:08.069> the<00:00:08.340> Excel<00:00:08.940> application

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
combination with the Excel application

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.200 
combination with the Excel application
to<00:00:09.780> quickly<00:00:10.139> update<00:00:10.349> unit<00:00:10.860> rates<00:00:11.070> and<00:00:11.340> we'll

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
to quickly update unit rates and we'll

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.150 
to quickly update unit rates and we'll
do<00:00:12.360> that<00:00:12.509> in<00:00:12.570> five<00:00:13.019> steps<00:00:13.410> so<00:00:13.590> first<00:00:13.920> we'll

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
do that in five steps so first we'll

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.609 
do that in five steps so first we'll
create<00:00:14.519> a<00:00:14.610> resources<00:00:15.089> report<00:00:15.599> open<00:00:16.320> that<00:00:16.470> in

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
create a resources report open that in

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.550 
create a resources report open that in
Excel<00:00:17.010> then<00:00:17.760> import<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.660> updated<00:00:19.050> unit<00:00:19.350> rates

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
Excel then import the updated unit rates

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:29.769 
Excel then import the updated unit rates
and<00:00:19.800> copy<00:00:20.100> them<00:00:20.430> into<00:00:21.029> our<00:00:21.330> current<00:00:21.810> project

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:29.779 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.440 

this<00:00:30.779> is<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.110> project<00:00:31.890> that<00:00:32.220> i<00:00:32.730> will<00:00:33.120> use<00:00:33.420> to

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
this is the project that i will use to

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.010 
this is the project that i will use to
explain<00:00:34.200> how<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.100> can<00:00:35.430> quickly<00:00:35.790> update<00:00:36.420> your

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
explain how you can quickly update your

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.770 
explain how you can quickly update your
unit<00:00:37.410> rates<00:00:37.650> in<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:37.980> project<00:00:38.220> so<00:00:39.120> we<00:00:39.150> see<00:00:39.480> here

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
unit rates in a project so we see here

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.100 
unit rates in a project so we see here
we<00:00:39.960> got<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.140> model<00:00:41.040> in<00:00:41.250> Vigo<00:00:41.580> office<00:00:41.960> with<00:00:42.960> the

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
we got a model in Vigo office with the

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.500 
we got a model in Vigo office with the
cost<00:00:43.350> planner<00:00:43.650> and<00:00:44.180> we've<00:00:45.180> got<00:00:45.390> our

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
cost planner and we've got our

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.439 
cost planner and we've got our
information<00:00:46.140> linked<00:00:46.830> up<00:00:46.980> so<00:00:47.220> the<00:00:47.460> elements

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:48.449 
information linked up so the elements

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:51.080 
information linked up so the elements
over<00:00:48.809> here<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.290> the<00:00:49.410> left<00:00:49.620> are<00:00:50.010> using<00:00:50.760> model

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
over here to the left are using model

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.939 
over here to the left are using model
based<00:00:51.300> quantities<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:52.140> have<00:00:52.290> like<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.710> price

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
based quantities to have like the price

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.000 
based quantities to have like the price
and<00:00:53.390> when<00:00:54.390> we<00:00:54.510> expand<00:00:54.960> these<00:00:55.199> nodes<00:00:55.590> you<00:00:55.860> can

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
and when we expand these nodes you can

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.810 
and when we expand these nodes you can
see<00:00:56.280> that<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:57.660> cost<00:00:57.900> is<00:00:58.110> calculated<00:00:58.470> at<00:00:58.890> the

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
see that the cost is calculated at the

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.999 
see that the cost is calculated at the
labor<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.190> material<00:01:02.190> resources<00:01:02.300> level<00:01:03.300> and

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:04.009 
labor and material resources level and

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:07.010 
labor and material resources level and
what<00:01:05.009> I<00:01:05.040> would<00:01:05.280> like<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.489> do<00:01:05.820> is<00:01:06.119> update<00:01:06.660> the

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
what I would like to do is update the

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.469 
what I would like to do is update the
unit<00:01:07.320> rates<00:01:07.530> so<00:01:07.920> we<00:01:08.100> got<00:01:08.310> unit<00:01:08.670> costs<00:01:08.940> in<00:01:09.210> here

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
unit rates so we got unit costs in here

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.950 
unit rates so we got unit costs in here
and<00:01:09.660> the<00:01:10.500> assumption<00:01:10.979> is<00:01:11.130> that<00:01:11.780> we<00:01:12.780> need<00:01:12.899> to

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
and the assumption is that we need to

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.499 
and the assumption is that we need to
increase<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.920> price<00:01:14.190> by<00:01:14.550> a<00:01:14.580> number<00:01:15.360> of

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
increase the price by a number of

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.249 
increase the price by a number of
percentage<00:01:16.050> percentage<00:01:16.800> points<00:01:18.050> so<00:01:19.050> in<00:01:19.170> order

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
percentage percentage points so in order

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.260 
percentage percentage points so in order
to<00:01:19.410> do<00:01:19.649> that<00:01:19.800> the<00:01:19.979> first<00:01:20.009> step<00:01:20.460> is<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.729> generate

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
to do that the first step is to generate

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.570 
to do that the first step is to generate
a<00:01:21.479> report<00:01:21.660> that<00:01:22.020> contains<00:01:23.009> all<00:01:23.369> of<00:01:23.399> the

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
a report that contains all of the

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.639 
a report that contains all of the
resources<00:01:24.090> that<00:01:24.420> I<00:01:24.630> used<00:01:25.020> in<00:01:25.259> this<00:01:25.410> project

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:25.649 
resources that I used in this project

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:30.020 
resources that I used in this project
and<00:01:26.869> we<00:01:27.869> create<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.320> report<00:01:28.710> in<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.160> create

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
and we create the report in the create

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:38.240 
and we create the report in the create
report<00:01:30.330> sportful<00:01:31.259> item

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.980 

in<00:01:39.250> the<00:01:39.430> report<00:01:39.610> view<00:01:40.210> you<00:01:40.390> can<00:01:40.540> see<00:01:40.570> I<00:01:40.810> have

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
in the report view you can see I have

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.830 
in the report view you can see I have
multiple<00:01:41.860> categories<00:01:42.490> set<00:01:43.090> up<00:01:43.240> and<00:01:43.450> I'm<00:01:43.540> going

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
multiple categories set up and I'm going

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.200 
multiple categories set up and I'm going
to<00:01:43.870> use<00:01:43.990> a<00:01:44.170> report<00:01:44.710> template<00:01:45.100> that<00:01:45.700> I<00:01:45.730> stored

that<00:02:25.360> i<00:02:25.780> have<00:02:26.020> in<00:02:26.380> this<00:02:26.530> project<00:02:27.090> along<00:02:28.090> with

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
that i have in this project along with

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.560 
that i have in this project along with
the<00:02:28.480> units<00:02:28.840> and<00:02:29.080> unit<00:02:29.410> rates<00:02:29.620> over<00:02:29.920> here<00:02:30.570> so

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
the units and unit rates over here so

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.200 
the units and unit rates over here so
what<00:02:31.750> I<00:02:31.780> want<00:02:32.020> to<00:02:32.140> do<00:02:32.440> with<00:02:32.800> that<00:02:32.830> is<00:02:33.280> save<00:02:34.030> it

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
what I want to do with that is save it

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.600 
what I want to do with that is save it
as<00:02:34.330> an<00:02:34.450> excel<00:02:34.780> file<00:02:35.050> and<00:02:35.350> then<00:02:35.580> update<00:02:36.580> the

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
as an excel file and then update the

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.030 
as an excel file and then update the
unit<00:02:37.030> grades<00:02:37.270> by<00:02:37.660> applying<00:02:38.050> a<00:02:38.380> percentage

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
unit grades by applying a percentage

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.350 
unit grades by applying a percentage
increase<00:02:39.460> in<00:02:39.730> sight<00:02:40.420> the<00:02:41.260> Excel<00:02:41.590> application

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
increase in sight the Excel application

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.270 
increase in sight the Excel application
so<00:02:43.360> in<00:02:43.450> order<00:02:43.570> to<00:02:43.720> do<00:02:43.900> that<00:02:44.080> I<00:02:44.350> save<00:02:44.890> this

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
so in order to do that I save this

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:53.070 
so in order to do that I save this
report<00:02:45.790> has<00:02:45.850> an<00:02:46.120> excel<00:02:46.420> file<00:02:46.650> and<00:02:48.390> oh

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.240 

looking<00:02:54.080> at<00:02:54.170> the<00:02:54.350> spreadsheet<00:02:54.920> that<00:02:54.950> i<00:02:55.130> just

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
looking at the spreadsheet that i just

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.800 
looking at the spreadsheet that i just
created<00:02:55.520> from<00:02:56.150> the<00:02:56.210> legal<00:02:57.080> office<00:02:57.200> report<00:02:57.980> and

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
created from the legal office report and

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.050 
created from the legal office report and
what<00:02:59.810> i<00:02:59.840> did<00:03:00.140> is<00:03:00.410> i<00:03:00.610> added<00:03:01.610> an<00:03:01.820> additional

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
what i did is i added an additional

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.480 
what i did is i added an additional
column<00:03:02.630> over<00:03:02.900> here<00:03:03.020> that<00:03:03.500> i<00:03:03.530> called<00:03:03.890> adjusted

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:04.490 
column over here that i called adjusted

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:07.150 
column over here that i called adjusted
unit<00:03:04.880> cost<00:03:05.120> and<00:03:05.510> the<00:03:05.740> values<00:03:06.740> in<00:03:06.770> this<00:03:07.100> column

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
unit cost and the values in this column

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.480 
unit cost and the values in this column
marches<00:03:07.730> the<00:03:08.330> copy<00:03:08.750> of<00:03:09.080> the<00:03:09.170> COS<00:03:10.100> that<00:03:10.310> is

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:10.490 
marches the copy of the COS that is

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.370 
marches the copy of the COS that is
currently<00:03:10.880> in<00:03:11.030> the<00:03:11.120> Vico<00:03:11.360> office<00:03:11.630> project<00:03:12.110> so

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
currently in the Vico office project so

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.890 
currently in the Vico office project so
with<00:03:12.890> a<00:03:12.920> simple<00:03:13.310> formula<00:03:13.670> i<00:03:13.940> just<00:03:14.270> copied<00:03:14.510> that

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
with a simple formula i just copied that

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.510 
with a simple formula i just copied that
number<00:03:15.970> what<00:03:16.970> i<00:03:17.000> can<00:03:17.330> do<00:03:17.450> now<00:03:17.480> is<00:03:18.100> look<00:03:19.100> up<00:03:19.280> the

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:19.520 
number what i can do now is look up the

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.600 
number what i can do now is look up the
the<00:03:19.820> resources<00:03:20.540> to<00:03:21.380> which<00:03:21.590> i<00:03:21.800> want<00:03:22.070> to<00:03:22.220> apply<00:03:22.580> a

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
the resources to which i want to apply a

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:28.570 
the resources to which i want to apply a
unit<00:03:23.060> rate<00:03:23.210> increase<00:03:24.430> and<00:03:26.530> apply<00:03:27.530> a<00:03:27.830> factor<00:03:28.370> to

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
unit rate increase and apply a factor to

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.480 
unit rate increase and apply a factor to
them<00:03:28.790> so<00:03:29.420> in<00:03:29.810> this<00:03:30.080> example<00:03:30.290> I<00:03:30.950> will<00:03:30.980> apply<00:03:31.459> a

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:31.490 
them so in this example I will apply a

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.940 
them so in this example I will apply a
three<00:03:31.970> percent<00:03:32.330> cost<00:03:32.660> increase<00:03:33.140> to<00:03:33.709> all<00:03:33.830> of

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
three percent cost increase to all of

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.030 
three percent cost increase to all of
the<00:03:34.040> labor<00:03:34.580> resources<00:03:35.470> I'm<00:03:36.470> going<00:03:36.680> to<00:03:36.770> modify

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
the labor resources I'm going to modify

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.449 
the labor resources I'm going to modify
the<00:03:37.220> firm<00:03:37.730> formula<00:03:38.300> for<00:03:38.600> for<00:03:39.590> those<00:03:39.770> i'm<00:03:40.070> going

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
the firm formula for for those i'm going

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:44.730 
the firm formula for for those i'm going
to<00:03:40.640> multiply<00:03:41.209> that<00:03:41.750> by<00:03:41.810> a<00:03:41.959> factor<00:03:42.310> 1.03<00:03:43.310> and

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:44.740 
to multiply that by a factor 1.03 and

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:49.090 
to multiply that by a factor 1.03 and
i'll<00:03:45.740> copy<00:03:46.430> that<00:03:46.730> down<00:03:47.620> so<00:03:48.620> that<00:03:48.650> it<00:03:49.070> is

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
i'll copy that down so that it is

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.770 
i'll copy that down so that it is
applied<00:03:49.670> to<00:03:49.880> all<00:03:50.060> of<00:03:50.240> the<00:03:50.360> leg<00:03:50.570> or<00:03:50.780> resources

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
applied to all of the leg or resources

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.330 
applied to all of the leg or resources
i'm<00:03:53.780> going<00:03:54.020> to<00:03:54.260> save<00:03:55.130> this<00:03:55.840> spreadsheet<00:03:56.840> and

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
i'm going to save this spreadsheet and

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.220 
i'm going to save this spreadsheet and
i'm<00:03:58.340> going<00:03:58.519> to<00:03:58.640> bring<00:03:58.970> in<00:03:59.150> this<00:03:59.420> data<00:03:59.660> in<00:03:59.930> a<00:04:00.019> new

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
i'm going to bring in this data in a new

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:09.340 
i'm going to bring in this data in a new

cost but the adjusted unit cost and
that's<00:05:00.740> the<00:05:01.160> unit<00:05:01.460> cost<00:05:01.700> property<00:05:04.000> then<00:05:05.000> after

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
that's the unit cost property then after

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.570 
that's the unit cost property then after
that<00:05:05.450> I<00:05:05.510> validate<00:05:06.500> and<00:05:06.680> calculate<00:05:07.130> to<00:05:07.370> fill

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
that I validate and calculate to fill

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.880 
that I validate and calculate to fill
out<00:05:07.760> all<00:05:08.060> of<00:05:08.090> the<00:05:08.570> missing<00:05:09.200> information<00:05:09.410> with

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:09.890 
out all of the missing information with

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:13.360 
out all of the missing information with
defaults<00:05:10.430> and<00:05:10.810> then<00:05:11.810> I<00:05:11.930> run<00:05:12.170> the<00:05:12.620> compare<00:05:13.220> and

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
defaults and then I run the compare and

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.470 
defaults and then I run the compare and
update<00:05:13.700> and<00:05:14.470> copy<00:05:15.470> everything<00:05:16.010> into<00:05:16.610> that<00:05:16.910> new

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:17.480 
update and copy everything into that new

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:22.660 
update and copy everything into that new
project<00:05:17.960> as<00:05:18.170> I<00:05:18.290> say<00:05:18.530> update<00:05:19.070> all<00:05:21.490> so<00:05:22.490> now<00:05:22.640> I

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:22.670 
project as I say update all so now I

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:26.080 
project as I say update all so now I
have<00:05:22.970> a<00:05:23.740> project<00:05:24.740> that's<00:05:25.310> called<00:05:25.610> resource

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.090 
have a project that's called resource

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.780 
have a project that's called resource
unit<00:05:26.450> rates<00:05:26.630> that<00:05:27.620> contains<00:05:28.100> all<00:05:28.340> of<00:05:28.460> the

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:28.790 
unit rates that contains all of the

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:32.260 
unit rates that contains all of the
updated<00:05:29.540> unit<00:05:29.870> rates<00:05:30.320> that<00:05:30.830> I<00:05:31.220> brought<00:05:32.030> in

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.270 
updated unit rates that I brought in

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:40.230 
updated unit rates that I brought in
from<00:05:32.540> the<00:05:32.720> Excel<00:05:32.930> spreadsheet

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.430 

I've<00:05:40.960> now<00:05:41.169> opened<00:05:41.830> the<00:05:42.569> Big<00:05:43.569> O<00:05:43.690> lab<00:05:43.960> project

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:44.440 
I've now opened the Big O lab project

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.100 
I've now opened the Big O lab project
again<00:05:45.310> and<00:05:45.610> the<00:05:46.210> project<00:05:46.599> that<00:05:46.690> we<00:05:46.840> started

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.110 
again and the project that we started

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:48.900 
again and the project that we started
off<00:05:47.259> with<00:05:47.500> so<00:05:47.889> here<00:05:48.069> we<00:05:48.099> see<00:05:48.340> the<00:05:48.460> full<00:05:48.669> cost

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:48.910 
off with so here we see the full cost

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:52.339 
off with so here we see the full cost
structure<00:05:49.860> with<00:05:50.860> the<00:05:51.009> elements<00:05:51.400> that<00:05:51.610> we

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:52.349 
structure with the elements that we

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:56.999 
structure with the elements that we
identified<00:05:53.349> earlier<00:05:53.710> and<00:05:54.690> I<00:05:55.690> have<00:05:56.500> clicked<00:05:56.889> on

00:05:56.999 --> 00:05:57.009

the project and references view and for
the<00:06:00.340> reference<00:06:00.699> i'm<00:06:00.940> going<00:06:01.210> to<00:06:01.360> pick<00:06:01.539> the

resource unit rates project that we use

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:10.170 
resource unit rates project that we use
to<00:06:07.240> bring<00:06:07.479> in<00:06:07.630> the<00:06:08.590> update<00:06:09.039> updated<00:06:09.880> resource

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:10.180 
to bring in the update updated resource

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.950 
to bring in the update updated resource
prices<00:06:10.539> earlier<00:06:11.520> in<00:06:12.520> order<00:06:12.940> to<00:06:13.150> now<00:06:13.330> update

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:13.960 
prices earlier in order to now update

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:18.059 
prices earlier in order to now update
all<00:06:14.199> of<00:06:14.560> the<00:06:15.220> the<00:06:15.819> resources<00:06:16.659> in<00:06:16.930> the<00:06:17.620> project

00:06:18.059 --> 00:06:18.069 
all of the the resources in the project

00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:20.240 
all of the the resources in the project
so<00:06:18.340> over<00:06:18.610> here<00:06:18.909> i'm<00:06:19.060> going<00:06:19.509> to<00:06:19.659> create<00:06:19.990> a

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:20.250 
so over here i'm going to create a

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:24.600 
so over here i'm going to create a
temporary<00:06:21.630> assembly<00:06:22.630> in<00:06:23.020> my<00:06:23.289> project<00:06:23.560> and<00:06:23.949> I

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:24.610 
temporary assembly in my project and I

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:31.080 
temporary assembly in my project and I
call<00:06:24.819> that<00:06:24.849> update<00:06:25.590> pricing<00:06:26.590> and<00:06:29.520> in<00:06:30.520> that<00:06:30.819> I'm

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:31.090 
call that update pricing and in that I'm

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:34.080 
call that update pricing and in that I'm
going<00:06:31.330> to<00:06:31.479> copy<00:06:31.720> all<00:06:32.110> off<00:06:32.409> the<00:06:32.680> labor<00:06:33.430> unit

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:34.090 
going to copy all off the labor unit

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:36.420 
going to copy all off the labor unit
rates<00:06:34.330> for<00:06:34.599> now<00:06:34.720> by<00:06:35.650> just<00:06:35.919> dragging<00:06:36.130> and

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:36.430 
rates for now by just dragging and

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:38.640 
rates for now by just dragging and
dropping<00:06:36.580> so<00:06:37.270> I'm<00:06:37.360> moving<00:06:37.780> that<00:06:38.139> over<00:06:38.409> from

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:38.650 
dropping so I'm moving that over from

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:41.670 
dropping so I'm moving that over from
left<00:06:38.800> to<00:06:38.949> right<00:06:39.630> and<00:06:40.630> the<00:06:40.870> program<00:06:41.080> will<00:06:41.259> tell

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:41.680 
left to right and the program will tell

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.870 
left to right and the program will tell
me<00:06:41.830> that<00:06:42.840> these<00:06:43.840> resources<00:06:44.500> already<00:06:44.800> exist<00:06:45.610> in

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:45.880 
me that these resources already exist in

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.980 
me that these resources already exist in
the<00:06:45.969> project<00:06:46.389> these<00:06:46.690> components<00:06:47.349> of<00:06:48.870> with<00:06:49.870> the

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:49.990 
the project these components of with the

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:52.469 
the project these components of with the
same<00:06:50.229> code<00:06:50.530> are<00:06:50.860> already<00:06:51.729> included<00:06:51.940> in<00:06:52.389> the

00:06:52.469 --> 00:06:52.479 
same code are already included in the

00:06:52.479 --> 00:06:54.959 
same code are already included in the
project<00:06:52.690> and<00:06:53.110> therefore<00:06:53.650> there's<00:06:54.070> a<00:06:54.190> conflict

00:06:54.959 --> 00:06:54.969 
project and therefore there's a conflict

00:06:54.969 --> 00:06:57.870 
project and therefore there's a conflict
that<00:06:55.500> is<00:06:56.500> exactly<00:06:56.770> what<00:06:57.130> we<00:06:57.310> want<00:06:57.669> to<00:06:57.759> achieve

00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:57.880 
that is exactly what we want to achieve

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.189 
that is exactly what we want to achieve
I<00:06:58.500> want<00:06:59.500> to<00:06:59.560> overwrite<00:07:00.280> the<00:07:00.580> existing

00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:01.199 
I want to overwrite the existing

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:04.200 
I want to overwrite the existing
components<00:07:02.199> to<00:07:02.830> update<00:07:03.250> the<00:07:03.460> resource<00:07:03.849> unit

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:04.210 
components to update the resource unit

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:06.360 
components to update the resource unit
rates<00:07:04.389> and<00:07:04.930> I<00:07:04.990> want<00:07:05.199> to<00:07:05.320> apply<00:07:05.590> that<00:07:05.800> to<00:07:06.009> all<00:07:06.219> of

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:06.370 
rates and I want to apply that to all of

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:09.080 
rates and I want to apply that to all of
the<00:07:06.520> conflicts<00:07:06.969> so<00:07:07.810> I<00:07:07.840> pick<00:07:08.050> over<00:07:08.380> right<00:07:08.560> and

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:09.090 
the conflicts so I pick over right and

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:12.990 
the conflicts so I pick over right and
at<00:07:10.090> the<00:07:10.240> end<00:07:10.270> of<00:07:10.539> the<00:07:10.690> copy<00:07:11.020> operation<00:07:11.819> we<00:07:12.819> will

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:13.000 
at the end of the copy operation we will

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.600 
at the end of the copy operation we will
have<00:07:13.300> all<00:07:13.840> of<00:07:13.990> the<00:07:14.110> resources<00:07:14.460> included<00:07:15.460> in

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:15.610 
have all of the resources included in

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:19.409 
have all of the resources included in
here<00:07:16.440> and<00:07:17.550> all<00:07:18.550> of<00:07:18.759> the<00:07:18.880> unit<00:07:19.180> rates

00:07:19.409 --> 00:07:19.419 
here and all of the unit rates

00:07:19.419 --> 00:07:20.939 
here and all of the unit rates
throughout<00:07:19.870> the<00:07:20.050> project<00:07:20.289> and<00:07:20.680> will<00:07:20.800> be

00:07:20.939 --> 00:07:20.949 
throughout the project and will be

00:07:20.949 --> 00:07:23.610 
throughout the project and will be
updated<00:07:21.130> so<00:07:21.639> that<00:07:21.880> the<00:07:22.360> new<00:07:22.509> unit<00:07:23.199> rates<00:07:23.380> are

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:23.620 
updated so that the new unit rates are

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:24.980 
updated so that the new unit rates are
reflected<00:07:24.250> and

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:24.990 
reflected and

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:27.790 
reflected and
there<00:07:25.170> is<00:07:25.290> a<00:07:25.320> price<00:07:25.950> increase<00:07:26.220> as<00:07:26.700> you<00:07:27.330> can<00:07:27.450> see

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:27.800 
there is a price increase as you can see

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.710 
there is a price increase as you can see
in<00:07:28.800> the<00:07:28.950> project<00:07:29.340> as<00:07:29.430> a<00:07:29.460> result<00:07:29.820> of<00:07:29.880> that<00:07:29.940> so

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:30.720 
in the project as a result of that so

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.850 
in the project as a result of that so
that<00:07:30.870> is<00:07:30.960> a<00:07:30.990> very<00:07:31.200> quick<00:07:31.560> way<00:07:31.740> to<00:07:32.150> use<00:07:33.150> Excel<00:07:33.600> to

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:33.860 
that is a very quick way to use Excel to
