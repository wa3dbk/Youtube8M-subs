make a video if you want okay so start

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.999 
make a video if you want okay so start
you're<00:01:14.220> going<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.430> start<00:01:14.610> with<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:15.680> 22<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:16.979> a

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
you're going to start with a 22 and a

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.719 
you're going to start with a 22 and a
semicolon<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:18.890> it<00:01:19.890> starts<00:01:20.340> from<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.490> bottom

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
semicolon and it starts from the bottom

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.700 
semicolon and it starts from the bottom
to<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.030> top<00:01:21.500> so<00:01:22.520> it's<00:01:23.520> seven<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.470> put<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.500> comma

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
to the top so it's seven and put a comma

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.249 
to the top so it's seven and put a comma
that<00:01:26.640> means<00:01:26.880> you're<00:01:27.240> going<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.540> go<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.170> the

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
that means you're going to go to the

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.940 
that means you're going to go to the
next<00:01:28.439> layer<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:29.479> so<00:01:30.479> I<00:01:30.509> want<00:01:30.960> my<00:01:31.110> next<00:01:31.799> layer

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
next layer and so I want my next layer

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.880 
next layer and so I want my next layer
to<00:01:32.130> be<00:01:32.250> lava<00:01:32.460> so<00:01:32.850> that's<00:01:33.030> 10<00:01:33.240> type<00:01:33.750> of<00:01:33.900> 10<00:01:34.079> if

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
to be lava so that's 10 type of 10 if

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.770 
to be lava so that's 10 type of 10 if
you<00:01:35.130> only<00:01:35.310> put<00:01:35.700> if<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:36.000> only<00:01:36.119> put<00:01:36.329> that<00:01:36.509> that

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
you only put if you only put that that

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.800 
you only put if you only put that that
will<00:01:36.900> only<00:01:37.020> be<00:01:37.259> one<00:01:37.439> layer<00:01:37.619> but<00:01:37.979> if<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.250> put

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
will only be one layer but if you put

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.830 
will only be one layer but if you put
say<00:01:39.920> five<00:01:40.920> times<00:01:41.400> zero<00:01:41.850> that<00:01:42.090> means<00:01:42.150> you're

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
say five times zero that means you're

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.340 
say five times zero that means you're
going<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.079> get<00:01:43.200> five<00:01:43.560> five<00:01:44.220> layers<00:01:44.549> of<00:01:45.060> 0<00:01:46.020> which

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
going to get five five layers of 0 which

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.539 
going to get five five layers of 0 which
0<00:01:46.409> is<00:01:46.829> air<00:01:47.100> so<00:01:48.030> that's<00:01:48.210> what<00:01:48.360> I<00:01:48.390> just<00:01:48.570> did<00:01:48.750> and

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
0 is air so that's what I just did and

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:53.389 
0 is air so that's what I just did and
I'm<00:01:50.549> going<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:50.820> do<00:01:50.939> mirror<00:01:51.810> image<00:01:52.170> like<00:01:53.159> that

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
I'm going to do mirror image like that

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.999 
I'm going to do mirror image like that
so<00:01:54.090> that's<00:01:54.240> oh<00:01:54.720> you<00:01:55.170> know<00:01:55.320> like<00:01:55.649> we<00:01:55.770> saw<00:01:55.979> a

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
so that's oh you know like we saw a

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.670 
so that's oh you know like we saw a
while<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:57.090> end<00:01:57.240> of<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.450> two<00:01:57.659> sodas<00:01:58.409> grass

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
while and the end of the two sodas grass

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.209 
while and the end of the two sodas grass
on<00:01:58.829> top<00:01:58.979> and<00:02:00.740> semicolon<00:02:01.740> if<00:02:01.860> you<00:02:01.979> want<00:02:02.159> to

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
on top and semicolon if you want to

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.450 
on top and semicolon if you want to
change<00:02:02.399> like<00:02:03.290> the<00:02:04.290> genre<00:02:04.770> of<00:02:05.040> where<00:02:05.250> you<00:02:05.340> going

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
change like the genre of where you going

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.809 
change like the genre of where you going
to<00:02:05.520> type<00:02:05.670> next<00:02:05.880> like<00:02:06.299> biomes<00:02:07.229> or

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.869 

and<00:02:10.659> he<00:02:10.869> generated<00:02:11.260> structures<00:02:11.609> that<00:02:12.609> he<00:02:12.760> can

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:12.879 
and he generated structures that he can

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:15.330 
and he generated structures that he can
split<00:02:13.120> there<00:02:13.329> so<00:02:13.810> village<00:02:14.709> I<00:02:14.950> want<00:02:15.159> to<00:02:15.219> put<00:02:15.310> a
