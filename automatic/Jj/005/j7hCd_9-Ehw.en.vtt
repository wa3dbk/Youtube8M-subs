00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.970
 welcome to the guide rejecting lax by 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.900
 playing dota 2 with people playing 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.969
 better than you understood better than you i am always with 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.070
 these are not played because I have a lot 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.949
 cool friends who play dota and 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.740
 very good though true but because 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.050
 I play very badly in dota 2, but for now I'm 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.230
 I build up a skill little by little there is one 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.720
 trouble do the rest i'm after them 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.140
 i can't keep up basically i hope so 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.120
 that my opponents will be much worse than me 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.920
 opponents need weak so if 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.649
 you see that I went into the game please 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.020
 shoot down your skill level 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:45.420
 such is true when linus lich me 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.329
 surely a type nightmare falls on your head 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.210
 windduner plus house night and my grandson 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.399
 will beetle kill humiliate from times in 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.180
 since he is not a moron 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.280
 chaos knight 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.370
 because i will have u about nits from 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.000
 times at times and have me be a partner 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.539
 linings 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.290
 then we will sulk that poison or farm and I 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.210
 I'll be ok 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.340
 that I will not have objected to skipnut 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.100
 or war friends houses , etc. etc. 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:15.240
 shorter for me and so hard when playing with 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.250
 the best you die often okay so 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.640
 should be if they are better 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.280
 then they need to know me, but when you are with 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.590
 the best in one team are others 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.020
 negative sides that i wanted 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.850
 would pay attention first players 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.060
 pro-level will look at you pipe and 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.970
 talk and perio by pressing the home button and 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.740
 everything will be fine give this advice they 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.409
 will wait for it to work with 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.079
 now about the players and they are as instructors 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.490
 in a driving school such everything is so first in 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.799
 Then look at the mirror including 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.049
 turn signal and the turn is just as easy 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:52.829
 mirror and then turn signal then turn 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.780
 instead I â€™ll get bibiku like hell 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.420
 I rush about noticing others and in the end 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.149
 bump tree from time to time new 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.689
 again and again Bibiku swear at them 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:06.450
 crashing into giving you advice and waiting 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:09.390
 their performance but this will not happen no 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.460
 because dota 2 is much harder driving 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.530
 driving 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.810
 it's just that if you compare when 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.760
 driving you do not suck a black hole 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.190
 but only if you will not cut by 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.680
 center of london friday night so 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.720
 why is it so hard to play with 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.830
 Good players , can you imagine 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.860
 court jester 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.850
 and good players are valiant 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:32.810

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:38.810
 dance dancing sorry bells 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:41.420
 but then when else for the slaughter they will start 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:45.050
 humiliate you and your weakness and you will become 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:47.540
 the object of their disgust is your left fool 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:50.390
 why didn't you protect the dark knight in 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.880
 deadly battle because all that u 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.580
 I have to fight this is funny 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:59.000
 tea stick with a head hat on the end and 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:01.040
 these funny shoes and you 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.590
 paralyzes indecision regarding 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.870
 your every action is good players 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.300

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.020
 they can also make sure that 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.900
 do you 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:14.210
 I never do such things I never 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.360
 don't know what my teammates are doing there 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:19.970
 they will look if you are a jungler or 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.850
 a liner like me will be watching you 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.760
 and here is the very height of jan league formidable 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:30.130

 type of glados something next for everything

 aperture have you farted Dave enough 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:48.470
 poking around in the nose dave it's terrible and 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:51.650
 the third is perhaps the most nightmarish 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.100
 you from couples live all both villages to them from couples 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.830
 live 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:57.140
 all pleasure is flying in the ass because 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.660
 your news you just stole 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:02.120
 friendly time maybe an hour or more 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.720
 it makes you happy 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.580
 happier 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.370

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.090
 dota 2 doesn't quite work out but i 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.980
 try 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:18.890
 it turns out that I depend on what I am 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:21.500
 kick ass and I each have my own success 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:23.870
 I naturally celebrate the moment 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.680
 look here for the sake of this 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.680
 at least me 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:04.539
 just because of that i keep playing 

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:07.150
 because of that i liked it but 

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:10.030
 the worst thing in a game with good 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.129
 knowledge players that when you won 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:14.020
 the whole team 

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:16.720
 your only merit is that you 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.729
 did not drag them into the shit from you 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:21.550

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:33.069
 whore penetration such as excellent

 upon me that I am the keeper of the new 

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:57.400
