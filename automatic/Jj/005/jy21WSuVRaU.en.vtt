firstly I have a fish tank which is just
here<00:02:28.769> and<00:02:29.769> all<00:02:30.010> you<00:02:30.130> have<00:02:30.220> to<00:02:30.400> do<00:02:30.489> is<00:02:30.549> feed<00:02:30.819> the

fish and they in turn put their deposits

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.280 
fish and they in turn put their deposits
into<00:02:34.000> the<00:02:34.150> water<00:02:34.390> which<00:02:34.690> is<00:02:34.720> a<00:02:34.870> sort<00:02:35.170> of<00:02:35.200> a

vegetables grown without soil what is

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.060 
vegetables grown without soil what is
constantly<00:02:52.420> there<00:02:52.750> and<00:02:52.989> the<00:02:53.500> nutrients<00:02:53.950> are

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
constantly there and the nutrients are

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.580 
constantly there and the nutrients are
being<00:02:54.280> fed<00:02:54.549> from<00:02:54.970> the<00:02:55.150> fish<00:02:55.390> the<00:02:55.900> gravel<00:02:56.350> beds

being fed from the fish the gravel beds

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.509 
being fed from the fish the gravel beds
or<00:02:57.040> the<00:02:57.250> gardens<00:02:57.730> also<00:02:58.299> act<00:02:58.600> as<00:02:58.890> a<00:02:59.890> sieve<00:03:00.250> as<00:03:00.489> a

or the gardens also act as a sieve as a

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:02.789 
or the gardens also act as a sieve as a
filter<00:03:00.910> so<00:03:01.720> they<00:03:01.840> clear<00:03:02.170> the<00:03:02.319> water<00:03:02.530> which

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
filter so they clear the water which

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.039 
filter so they clear the water which
then<00:03:03.010> goes<00:03:03.160> back<00:03:03.430> into<00:03:03.640> the<00:03:03.730> fish<00:03:04.000> tank<00:03:04.049> so

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
then goes back into the fish tank so

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:06.809 
then goes back into the fish tank so
you've<00:03:05.230> got<00:03:05.260> fish<00:03:05.680> produce<00:03:05.980> when<00:03:06.519> they<00:03:06.640> grow

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
you've got fish produce when they grow

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:08.640 
you've got fish produce when they grow
all<00:03:06.850> you<00:03:07.209> harvest<00:03:07.569> the<00:03:07.690> fish<00:03:07.930> you've<00:03:08.410> got
