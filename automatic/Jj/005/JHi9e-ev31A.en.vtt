very different all project based and so

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.810 
very different all project based and so
having<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.200> students<00:02:01.710> go<00:02:02.399> out<00:02:02.430> into<00:02:02.729> the

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
having the students go out into the

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.580 
having the students go out into the
community<00:02:03.210> and<00:02:03.240> learn<00:02:04.079> more<00:02:04.290> about<00:02:04.409> the

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
community and learn more about the

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.899 
community and learn more about the
development<00:02:05.040> projects<00:02:05.369> that<00:02:05.460> are<00:02:05.579> going<00:02:05.670> on

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
development projects that are going on

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.190 
development projects that are going on
and<00:02:06.119> then<00:02:06.210> connecting<00:02:06.659> that<00:02:06.780> back<00:02:06.960> to<00:02:07.110> the

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
and then connecting that back to the

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.809 
and then connecting that back to the
curriculum<00:02:07.590> in<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.770> school<00:02:08.039> is<00:02:08.250> one<00:02:08.670> of<00:02:08.759> the

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
curriculum in the school is one of the

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.059 
curriculum in the school is one of the
big<00:02:09.000> elements<00:02:09.149> of<00:02:09.629> this<00:02:09.959> so<00:02:10.379> it's<00:02:10.739> a<00:02:10.860> great

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
big elements of this so it's a great

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.220 
big elements of this so it's a great
experience<00:02:11.190> for<00:02:11.819> us<00:02:12.000> to<00:02:12.360> follow<00:02:12.599> through<00:02:13.050> with

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
experience for us to follow through with

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.850 
experience for us to follow through with
the<00:02:13.379> same<00:02:13.590> way

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
the same way

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:14.900 
the same way
search<00:02:14.040> that's<00:02:14.280> being<00:02:14.520> done<00:02:14.730> at<00:02:14.880> the

search that's being done at the
university<00:02:15.540> level<00:02:15.720> about<00:02:16.320> how<00:02:16.530> we<00:02:16.590> learn<00:02:16.980> but

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
university level about how we learn but

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.300 
university level about how we learn but
also<00:02:17.790> to<00:02:18.210> let<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.720> students<00:02:19.170> really<00:02:19.530> inspire

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
also to let the students really inspire

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.080 
also to let the students really inspire
us<00:02:20.610> and<00:02:20.940> changing<00:02:21.660> what<00:02:22.080> works<00:02:22.380> in<00:02:22.710> steam<00:02:23.160> so

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
us and changing what works in steam so

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.220 
us and changing what works in steam so

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
relates to green energy we may look at

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.880 
relates to green energy we may look at
for<00:02:39.240> example<00:02:39.330> designing<00:02:40.290> a<00:02:40.380> garden<00:02:40.800> a

of this neighborhood and ask them what

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.670 
of this neighborhood and ask them what
are<00:02:46.890> the<00:02:47.130> vegetables<00:02:47.670> that<00:02:48.240> you<00:02:48.480> like<00:02:48.510> to<00:02:49.110> have

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
are the vegetables that you like to have

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.220 
are the vegetables that you like to have
but<00:02:49.980> you<00:02:50.010> maybe<00:02:50.310> cannot<00:02:50.700> afford<00:02:51.030> to<00:02:51.330> go<00:02:51.570> to<00:02:51.930> the

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
but you maybe cannot afford to go to the

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.479 
but you maybe cannot afford to go to the
store<00:02:52.590> and<00:02:52.920> purchase<00:02:53.640> what<00:02:54.390> we're<00:02:54.570> seeing

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
store and purchase what we're seeing

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.150 
store and purchase what we're seeing
beginning<00:02:56.489> to<00:02:56.580> take<00:02:56.820> shape<00:02:56.850> at<00:02:57.540> that<00:02:57.780> school

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
beginning to take shape at that school

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.060 
beginning to take shape at that school
will<00:02:59.160> truly<00:02:59.520> we<00:03:00.000> believe<00:03:00.500> revolutionized<00:03:01.500> how

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
will truly we believe revolutionized how

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.510 
will truly we believe revolutionized how
we<00:03:02.130> think<00:03:02.700> about<00:03:03.650> what<00:03:04.650> high<00:03:04.830> schools<00:03:05.220> should

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
we think about what high schools should

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.360 
we think about what high schools should
be<00:03:05.930> so<00:03:06.930> my<00:03:07.170> goal<00:03:07.410> is<00:03:07.440> that<00:03:07.800> my<00:03:07.920> classroom

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
be so my goal is that my classroom

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.600 
be so my goal is that my classroom
doesn't<00:03:09.090> look<00:03:09.360> like<00:03:09.900> a<00:03:09.930> classroom<00:03:10.470> I<00:03:10.680> have

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
doesn't look like a classroom I have

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.460 
doesn't look like a classroom I have
worked<00:03:12.000> so<00:03:12.120> that<00:03:12.390> it's<00:03:12.540> going<00:03:12.690> to<00:03:12.840> be<00:03:12.989> more<00:03:13.200> of

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
worked so that it's going to be more of

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.620 
worked so that it's going to be more of
a<00:03:13.709> group<00:03:14.190> environment<00:03:14.400> where<00:03:15.120> we're<00:03:15.300> going<00:03:15.510> to

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
a group environment where we're going to

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.259 
a group environment where we're going to
be<00:03:15.750> able<00:03:15.870> to<00:03:16.050> collaborate<00:03:16.890> but<00:03:17.100> also<00:03:17.370> do

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
be able to collaborate but also do

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.150 
be able to collaborate but also do
hands-on<00:03:18.840> learning<00:03:19.200> that's<00:03:19.769> going<00:03:20.040> to

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
hands-on learning that's going to

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.539 
hands-on learning that's going to
support<00:03:20.549> the<00:03:21.209> design<00:03:21.450> challenges<00:03:22.260> it's<00:03:23.100> going

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
support the design challenges it's going

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:25.789 
support the design challenges it's going
to<00:03:23.700> be<00:03:23.910> really<00:03:24.480> pushing<00:03:25.200> the<00:03:25.290> students<00:03:25.650> to

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
to be really pushing the students to

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.220 
to be really pushing the students to
come<00:03:26.280> up<00:03:26.459> with<00:03:26.700> these<00:03:26.850> ideas<00:03:26.910> and<00:03:27.600> really

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
come up with these ideas and really

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.560 
come up with these ideas and really
immerse<00:03:29.100> themselves<00:03:29.430> in<00:03:29.820> the<00:03:29.850> design<00:03:30.239> process

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
immerse themselves in the design process

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.840 
immerse themselves in the design process
and<00:03:31.110> it's<00:03:31.560> the<00:03:31.739> application<00:03:31.920> of<00:03:32.730> the

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
and it's the application of the

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.320 
and it's the application of the
knowledge<00:03:33.299> to<00:03:33.660> solve<00:03:34.470> some<00:03:35.160> of<00:03:35.280> the<00:03:35.430> real

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
knowledge to solve some of the real

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.390 
knowledge to solve some of the real
issues<00:03:36.440> communities<00:03:37.440> face<00:03:37.799> and<00:03:38.810> hopefully

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
issues communities face and hopefully

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.699 
issues communities face and hopefully
we're<00:03:41.400> not<00:03:41.730> only<00:03:42.000> growing<00:03:42.510> great<00:03:43.140> thinkers

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
we're not only growing great thinkers

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.199 
we're not only growing great thinkers
and<00:03:43.739> problem<00:03:44.519> solvers<00:03:44.970> but<00:03:45.630> we're<00:03:45.950> growing

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
and problem solvers but we're growing

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:50.030 
and problem solvers but we're growing

citizens of tomorrow the sky's the limit

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.979 
citizens of tomorrow the sky's the limit
and<00:03:50.489> students<00:03:51.239> would<00:03:51.330> definitely<00:03:51.660> have<00:03:51.780> voice

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
and students would definitely have voice

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:57.650 
and students would definitely have voice
and<00:03:52.440> and<00:03:53.100> in<00:03:53.670> what<00:03:53.970> we<00:03:54.090> do<00:03:54.209> here
