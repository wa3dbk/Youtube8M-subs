gaining<00:00:25.619> scientific<00:00:26.310> data<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.730> only<00:00:26.760> thing

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
gaining scientific data the only thing

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.000

we can check your shoot I said I know
the<00:00:42.570> whole<00:00:42.719> world<00:00:42.930> is<00:00:43.050> watching<00:00:43.170> now<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.739> I

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
the whole world is watching now and I

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.040 
the whole world is watching now and I
wish<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.850> world<00:00:45.000> could<00:00:45.239> see<00:00:45.390> what<00:00:45.539> I<00:00:45.570> see

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
wish the world could see what I see

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.319 
wish the world could see what I see
and<00:00:46.280> sometimes<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.460> have<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.789> go<00:00:47.910> up<00:00:48.059> really

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
and sometimes you have to go up really

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.229 
and sometimes you have to go up really
high<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.570> understand<00:00:49.200> how<00:00:49.379> small<00:00:49.680> you<00:00:49.890> are<00:00:50.239> no

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
high to understand how small you are no

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.400 
high to understand how small you are no
there<00:00:51.449> was<00:00:51.539> a<00:00:51.570> period<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:52.020> time<00:00:52.170> where<00:00:52.379> I

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
there was a period of time where I

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.750 
there was a period of time where I
really<00:00:52.649> thought<00:00:52.800> I'm<00:00:53.010> in<00:00:53.039> trouble<00:00:53.460> because<00:00:53.610> I

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
really thought I'm in trouble because I

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.209 
really thought I'm in trouble because I
have<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.120> man<00:00:54.780> I'll<00:00:54.930> push<00:00:55.260> button<00:00:55.739> where<00:00:55.949> I<00:00:55.980> can

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
have a man I'll push button where I can

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.459 
have a man I'll push button where I can
release<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.820> drogue<00:00:57.180> chute<00:00:57.420> which<00:00:57.870> pulls<00:00:58.260> me

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
release a drogue chute which pulls me

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.110 
release a drogue chute which pulls me
out<00:00:58.590> of<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.770> flat<00:00:58.949> spin<00:00:59.219> but<00:00:59.730> at<00:00:59.850> the<00:00:59.940> same

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
out of the flat spin but at the same

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.209 
out of the flat spin but at the same
time<00:01:00.359> I<00:01:00.420> knew<00:01:00.660> if<00:01:00.809> I<00:01:00.930> push<00:01:01.140> that<00:01:01.170> button<00:01:01.559> this

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
time I knew if I push that button this

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.590 
time I knew if I push that button this
thing<00:01:02.460> is<00:01:02.550> all<00:01:02.670> over<00:01:02.699> we're<00:01:03.030> not<00:01:03.180> gonna<00:01:03.390> fly

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
thing is all over we're not gonna fly

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.140 
thing is all over we're not gonna fly
supersonic<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.860> it's<00:01:05.489> hard<00:01:05.729> when<00:01:05.880> you<00:01:05.939> fall

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
supersonic and it's hard when you fall

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.670 
supersonic and it's hard when you fall
down<00:01:06.180> at<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:06.600> speed<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:06.900> have<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.380> make<00:01:07.530> that

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
down at that speed you have to make that

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.620 
down at that speed you have to make that
decision<00:01:08.010> you<00:01:08.280> know<00:01:08.400> some<00:01:08.760> somehow<00:01:09.360> we<00:01:09.420> have

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
decision you know some somehow we have

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.940 
decision you know some somehow we have
to<00:01:09.780> make<00:01:09.900> that<00:01:10.049> call<00:01:10.290> we<00:01:10.530> have<00:01:10.619> push<00:01:10.799> that

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
to make that call we have push that

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.429 
to make that call we have push that
button<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.490> stay<00:01:11.670> alive<00:01:11.909> or<00:01:12.360> do<00:01:12.810> I<00:01:12.900> fight<00:01:13.229> all

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
button and stay alive or do I fight all

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.160 
button and stay alive or do I fight all
my<00:01:13.470> way<00:01:14.189> down<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.090> break<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.810> speed<00:01:16.020> of<00:01:16.140> sound

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
my way down and break the speed of sound

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.160 
my way down and break the speed of sound
and<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:17.000> after<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.330> couple<00:01:18.570> seconds<00:01:18.960> I<00:01:19.049> had

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
and and after a couple seconds I had

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.870 
and and after a couple seconds I had
that<00:01:19.350> feeling<00:01:19.590> I<00:01:19.830> get<00:01:20.009> it<00:01:20.100> under<00:01:20.280> control<00:01:20.400> and

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
that feeling I get it under control and

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.030 
that feeling I get it under control and
I<00:01:21.600> did<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.170> that's<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.439> reason<00:01:22.680> why<00:01:22.770> we<00:01:22.860> broke

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
I did and that's the reason why we broke

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.780 
I did and that's the reason why we broke
the<00:01:23.130> speed<00:01:23.340> of<00:01:23.430> sound<00:01:23.460> today

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
the speed of sound today

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.160 
the speed of sound today
it's<00:01:26.790> it's<00:01:27.210> hard<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.510> describe<00:01:27.750> because<00:01:27.930> it

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
it's it's hard to describe because it

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.840 
it's it's hard to describe because it
didn't<00:01:28.380> feel<00:01:28.560> it<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:29.190> know<00:01:29.340> when<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.610> in<00:01:29.700> that

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
didn't feel it you know when you in that

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.810 
didn't feel it you know when you in that
pressure<00:01:30.119> suit<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.900> don't<00:01:31.080> feel<00:01:31.229> anything

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
pressure suit you don't feel anything

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.700 
pressure suit you don't feel anything
it's<00:01:32.820> like<00:01:33.030> being<00:01:33.270> in<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.479> cast<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:34.140> it

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
it's like being in a cast and it

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.950 
it's like being in a cast and it
happened<00:01:35.070> somehow<00:01:35.340> down<00:01:36.330> the<00:01:36.540> line<00:01:36.690> you<00:01:36.840> know

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960
