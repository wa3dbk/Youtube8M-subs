00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.089 

well<00:00:16.570> stuff<00:00:16.869> the<00:00:17.140> starting<00:00:17.560> point<00:00:17.740> was<00:00:17.860> very

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:18.099 
well stuff the starting point was very

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:22.409 
well stuff the starting point was very
much<00:00:18.279> trying<00:00:18.699> to<00:00:18.849> produce<00:00:20.099> a<00:00:21.210> series<00:00:22.210> of

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:22.419 
much trying to produce a series of

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:26.400 
much trying to produce a series of
products<00:00:22.840> that<00:00:23.080> which<00:00:25.110> presented<00:00:26.110> the<00:00:26.380> idea

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:26.410 
products that which presented the idea

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.279 
products that which presented the idea
more<00:00:27.160> about<00:00:27.460> media<00:00:28.000> and<00:00:28.269> necessarily<00:00:28.840> product

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:29.289 
more about media and necessarily product

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:32.869 
more about media and necessarily product
what<00:00:30.189> I<00:00:30.220> mean<00:00:30.460> by<00:00:30.640> that<00:00:30.670> is<00:00:31.060> that<00:00:31.090> each<00:00:31.689> product

00:00:32.869 --> 00:00:32.879 
what I mean by that is that each product

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:36.200 
what I mean by that is that each product
presents<00:00:33.879> itself<00:00:34.239> as<00:00:34.570> kind<00:00:35.199> of<00:00:35.230> a<00:00:35.320> solid

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
presents itself as kind of a solid

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.290 
presents itself as kind of a solid
continuous<00:00:37.210> block<00:00:38.040> with<00:00:39.040> no<00:00:39.309> parting<00:00:40.059> lines

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
continuous block with no parting lines

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.390 
continuous block with no parting lines
and<00:00:40.780> it<00:00:41.290> doesn't<00:00:41.620> feel<00:00:41.860> like<00:00:41.920> it's<00:00:42.280> an

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:42.400 
and it doesn't feel like it's an

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.700 
and it doesn't feel like it's an
assemblage<00:00:42.940> of<00:00:43.059> parts<00:00:43.570> that<00:00:43.809> have<00:00:44.410> kind<00:00:44.590> of

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
assemblage of parts that have kind of

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.350 
assemblage of parts that have kind of
been<00:00:44.829> brought<00:00:45.100> together<00:00:45.309> but<00:00:45.850> rather<00:00:46.090> almost

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.360 
been brought together but rather almost

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.869 
been brought together but rather almost
as<00:00:46.629> if<00:00:46.780> it's<00:00:46.930> it's<00:00:47.680> born<00:00:48.129> out<00:00:48.370> of<00:00:48.399> its<00:00:48.670> own

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:48.879 
as if it's it's born out of its own

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:53.459 
as if it's it's born out of its own
material<00:00:49.510> and<00:00:50.219> by<00:00:51.219> doing<00:00:51.430> that<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.960> customer

00:00:53.459 --> 00:00:53.469 
material and by doing that the customer

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:59.040 
material and by doing that the customer
kind<00:00:53.739> of<00:00:53.800> feels<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:57.219> is<00:00:57.640> more<00:00:58.329> like<00:00:58.719> a

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
kind of feels that it is more like a

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.910 
kind of feels that it is more like a
storage<00:00:59.920> media<00:01:00.730> a<00:01:01.059> bit<00:01:01.930> like<00:01:02.109> a<00:01:02.140> video

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
storage media a bit like a video

cassette or tape cassette or a CD rather
than<00:01:06.970> necessarily<00:01:07.180> a<00:01:07.660> product<00:01:08.140> that<00:01:08.490> has<00:01:09.490> lots

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
than necessarily a product that has lots

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.340 
than necessarily a product that has lots
of<00:01:09.850> components<00:01:10.210> in<00:01:10.600> it<00:01:10.690> that<00:01:10.869> are<00:01:10.899> working<00:01:11.729> and

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
of components in it that are working and

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.080 
of components in it that are working and
part<00:01:14.350> of<00:01:14.380> the<00:01:14.500> reason<00:01:14.530> to<00:01:14.979> do<00:01:15.160> that<00:01:15.190> was<00:01:15.610> to

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
part of the reason to do that was to

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.600 
part of the reason to do that was to
create<00:01:16.900> a<00:01:17.110> lot<00:01:17.470> of<00:01:17.560> trust<00:01:18.540> between<00:01:19.540> the

create a lot of trust between the

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.590 
create a lot of trust between the
product<00:01:21.610> and<00:01:21.880> the<00:01:22.780> user<00:01:23.290> who<00:01:23.500> is<00:01:23.619> using<00:01:24.600> when

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
product and the user who is using when

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.140 
product and the user who is using when
you<00:01:25.720> when<00:01:25.900> you<00:01:25.930> take<00:01:26.200> the<00:01:26.740> lid<00:01:26.950> off<00:01:26.979> it<00:01:27.939> just

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.150 
you when you take the lid off it just

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.700 
you when you take the lid off it just
simply<00:01:28.360> reveals<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:30.820> USB<00:01:31.720> plug<00:01:32.020> which<00:01:32.409> plugs

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
simply reveals a USB plug which plugs

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:38.580 
simply reveals a USB plug which plugs
into<00:01:32.829> the<00:01:33.009> computer<00:01:33.420> obviously<00:01:34.420> and<00:01:37.409> that<00:01:38.409> in

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
into the computer obviously and that in

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.649 
into the computer obviously and that in
itself<00:01:38.680> means<00:01:39.520> that<00:01:39.820> everything<00:01:40.119> is<00:01:40.390> self

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
itself means that everything is self

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:42.179 
itself means that everything is self
contained<00:01:40.720> within<00:01:41.320> the<00:01:41.439> product<00:01:41.770> it's<00:01:41.979> not

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:42.189 
contained within the product it's not

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:44.880 
contained within the product it's not
like<00:01:42.340> you<00:01:42.549> need<00:01:42.630> many<00:01:43.630> other<00:01:43.869> parts<00:01:44.350> to<00:01:44.740> be

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
like you need many other parts to be

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.780 
like you need many other parts to be
able<00:01:45.070> to<00:01:45.159> use<00:01:45.369> it<00:01:45.659> or<00:01:46.920> cables<00:01:47.920> or<00:01:48.159> transformers

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 
able to use it or cables or transformers

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.720 
able to use it or cables or transformers
or<00:01:48.939> those<00:01:49.090> sorts<00:01:49.240> of<00:01:49.420> things

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:51.730 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:56.100 

and<00:01:53.820> starting<00:01:54.820> point<00:01:55.060> for<00:01:55.210> the<00:01:55.330> DVD<00:01:55.660> fails

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
and starting point for the DVD fails

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.450 
and starting point for the DVD fails
again<00:01:56.440> very<00:01:56.980> very<00:01:57.010> much<00:01:57.340> the<00:01:57.520> same<00:01:57.930> but<00:01:59.460> what

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
again very very much the same but what

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.160 
again very very much the same but what
we<00:02:00.550> did<00:02:00.700> was<00:02:00.880> add<00:02:03.480> another<00:02:04.480> layer<00:02:04.810> to<00:02:04.840> it

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
we did was add another layer to it

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.220 
we did was add another layer to it
whereby<00:02:06.540> even<00:02:07.540> though<00:02:07.660> it's<00:02:07.780> a<00:02:07.840> mobile

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:08.230 
whereby even though it's a mobile

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:10.140 
whereby even though it's a mobile
product<00:02:08.680> it<00:02:08.830> generally<00:02:09.250> sits<00:02:09.520> on<00:02:09.670> the<00:02:09.760> table

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:10.150 
product it generally sits on the table

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:15.090 
product it generally sits on the table
and<00:02:10.740> so<00:02:11.740> when<00:02:11.920> you<00:02:12.040> turn<00:02:12.280> it<00:02:12.310> over<00:02:14.100> it's

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
and so when you turn it over it's

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.280 
and so when you turn it over it's
actually<00:02:15.280> revealing<00:02:15.790> part<00:02:16.270> of<00:02:16.420> its<00:02:16.570> parts<00:02:17.170> of

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
actually revealing part of its parts of

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.380 
actually revealing part of its parts of
it<00:02:17.410> its<00:02:17.800> inner<00:02:18.190> workings<00:02:18.220> in<00:02:18.880> terms<00:02:19.120> of<00:02:19.210> its

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
it its inner workings in terms of its

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.660 
it its inner workings in terms of its
drive<00:02:20.310> and<00:02:21.310> that<00:02:22.090> was<00:02:22.810> quite<00:02:23.050> an<00:02:23.170> interesting

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
drive and that was quite an interesting

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:31.170 
drive and that was quite an interesting
idea<00:02:24.670> for<00:02:25.210> demystifying<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:26.020> province<00:02:30.180> for

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
idea for demystifying the province for

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.560 
idea for demystifying the province for
this<00:02:32.110> kind<00:02:32.350> of<00:02:32.380> market<00:02:32.970> lassie<00:02:33.970> is<00:02:34.120> really<00:02:34.420> the

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570 
this kind of market lassie is really the

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.030 
this kind of market lassie is really the
perfect<00:02:34.960> company<00:02:35.320> to<00:02:35.530> do<00:02:35.710> that<00:02:35.890> because

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
perfect company to do that because

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.650 
perfect company to do that because
they're<00:02:36.400> able<00:02:36.550> to<00:02:36.810> not<00:02:37.810> only<00:02:37.840> take<00:02:38.290> a<00:02:38.350> risk<00:02:38.680> of

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
they're able to not only take a risk of

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.770 
they're able to not only take a risk of
essentially<00:02:40.660> produce<00:02:40.990> on<00:02:41.200> a<00:02:41.230> box<00:02:41.530> which<00:02:42.780> you

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
essentially produce on a box which you

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.830 
essentially produce on a box which you
know<00:02:43.900> is<00:02:45.840> with<00:02:46.840> all<00:02:46.990> that<00:02:47.140> it<00:02:47.320> is<00:02:47.440> and<00:02:47.800> I<00:02:48.430> think

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
know is with all that it is and I think

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.470 
know is with all that it is and I think
by<00:02:49.840> doing<00:02:49.900> that<00:02:50.700> something<00:02:51.700> that<00:02:51.880> many<00:02:52.300> other

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
by doing that something that many other

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:58.500 
by doing that something that many other
companies<00:02:52.710> to<00:02:53.710> do

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.569 

you
