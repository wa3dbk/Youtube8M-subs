anyone is going to rub this hard on

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.959 
anyone is going to rub this hard on
their<00:01:59.820> eyelid<00:02:00.290> I<00:02:01.290> personally<00:02:02.280> I<00:02:02.310> have<00:02:02.610> a<00:02:02.640> mac

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
their eyelid I personally I have a mac

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.200 
their eyelid I personally I have a mac
fluidline<00:02:03.509> in<00:02:04.200> black<00:02:04.530> track<00:02:04.860> which<00:02:05.640> is<00:02:05.670> the

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
fluidline in black track which is the

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.680 
fluidline in black track which is the
black<00:02:06.659> color<00:02:07.140> so<00:02:08.009> it<00:02:08.340> will<00:02:08.610> be<00:02:08.700> impossible<00:02:09.090> to

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
black color so it will be impossible to

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:10.469 
black color so it will be impossible to
compare

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
compare

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.380

the<00:02:10.959> color<00:02:11.349> with<00:02:11.800> these<00:02:12.310> two<00:02:12.670> because<00:02:13.030> it's

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
the color with these two because it's

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.289 
the color with these two because it's
essentially<00:02:14.170> different<00:02:15.060> however<00:02:16.060> the

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:16.299 
essentially different however the

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:19.830 
essentially different however the
formula<00:02:16.870> i<00:02:17.080> can<00:02:17.290> say<00:02:17.530> that<00:02:17.739> mac<00:02:18.269> it's<00:02:19.269> a<00:02:19.629> lot

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
formula i can say that mac it's a lot

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.740 
formula i can say that mac it's a lot
more<00:02:19.870> gel<00:02:20.830> like<00:02:21.129> it's<00:02:21.430> a<00:02:21.580> lot<00:02:21.730> more<00:02:22.000> smoother

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
more gel like it's a lot more smoother

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.800 
more gel like it's a lot more smoother
you<00:02:23.319> have<00:02:23.560> around<00:02:23.890> maybe<00:02:24.610> 30<00:02:25.000> seconds<00:02:25.659> to

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
you have around maybe 30 seconds to

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.970 
you have around maybe 30 seconds to
really<00:02:26.349> work<00:02:26.709> with<00:02:26.739> that<00:02:27.400> gel<00:02:27.760> and<00:02:28.319> to<00:02:29.319> draw<00:02:29.739> a

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
really work with that gel and to draw a

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.800 
really work with that gel and to draw a
perfect<00:02:30.310> line<00:02:31.620> hover<00:02:32.620> for<00:02:33.069> these<00:02:33.790> ones<00:02:34.299> on<00:02:34.629> the

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
perfect line hover for these ones on the

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.680 
perfect line hover for these ones on the
Jane<00:02:35.140> gel<00:02:35.620> eyeliner<00:02:36.040> the<00:02:36.579> formula<00:02:36.910> is<00:02:37.090> a<00:02:37.299> bit

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
Jane gel eyeliner the formula is a bit

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.720 
Jane gel eyeliner the formula is a bit
drier<00:02:38.290> than<00:02:38.709> a<00:02:38.860> mac<00:02:39.099> fluidline<00:02:39.959> so<00:02:41.400> once<00:02:42.400> you

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
drier than a mac fluidline so once you

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.170 
drier than a mac fluidline so once you
put<00:02:43.329> it<00:02:43.480> on<00:02:43.690> I<00:02:44.019> just<00:02:44.769> dry<00:02:45.040> sup<00:02:45.340> so<00:02:45.970> you<00:02:46.060> probably

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
put it on I just dry sup so you probably

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.630 
put it on I just dry sup so you probably
only<00:02:46.720> have<00:02:46.810> 10<00:02:47.230> seconds<00:02:47.680> to<00:02:47.799> really<00:02:48.250> work<00:02:48.459> at

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
only have 10 seconds to really work at

only have 10 seconds to really work at
work<00:02:49.030> with<00:02:49.510> it<00:02:50.280> for<00:02:51.280> somebody<00:02:51.579> who<00:02:51.790> is<00:02:52.120> a

for<00:02:58.180> you<00:02:58.319> however<00:02:59.319> for<00:03:00.090> beginners<00:03:01.090> and<00:03:01.120> makeup

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
for you however for beginners and makeup

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.000 
for you however for beginners and makeup
might<00:03:02.560> be<00:03:02.739> a<00:03:02.769> little<00:03:03.280> bit<00:03:03.519> different<00:03:04.060> to<00:03:05.010> draw

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
might be a little bit different to draw

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.970 
might be a little bit different to draw
a<00:03:06.040> thin<00:03:06.459> line<00:03:06.489> with<00:03:06.970> it<00:03:07.150> and<00:03:07.810> my<00:03:08.260> suggestion<00:03:08.799> is

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
a thin line with it and my suggestion is

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.930 
a thin line with it and my suggestion is
that<00:03:10.079> really<00:03:11.079> use<00:03:11.200> it<00:03:11.379> to<00:03:11.530> your<00:03:11.739> advantage

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
that really use it to your advantage

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.240 
that really use it to your advantage
because<00:03:12.940> I<00:03:13.239> am<00:03:13.540> NOT<00:03:13.720> a<00:03:13.750> big<00:03:13.959> fan<00:03:13.989> of<00:03:14.250> eyeliners

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
because I am NOT a big fan of eyeliners

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.780 
because I am NOT a big fan of eyeliners
I<00:03:16.109> personally<00:03:17.109> think<00:03:17.380> eyeliner<00:03:18.099> pencils<00:03:18.669> are

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
I personally think eyeliner pencils are

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.420 
I personally think eyeliner pencils are
hard<00:03:19.359> to<00:03:19.569> work<00:03:19.780> with<00:03:19.989> every<00:03:20.829> time<00:03:20.980> you<00:03:21.130> use<00:03:21.220> it

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
hard to work with every time you use it

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.550 
hard to work with every time you use it
you<00:03:21.730> have<00:03:21.849> to<00:03:22.000> sharpen<00:03:22.569> it<00:03:22.870> to<00:03:22.959> a<00:03:22.989> fine<00:03:23.290> point

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
you have to sharpen it to a fine point

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.250 
you have to sharpen it to a fine point
and<00:03:24.010> also<00:03:24.669> sometimes<00:03:25.419> especially<00:03:25.750> in<00:03:26.169> a

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
and also sometimes especially in a

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:32.000 
and also sometimes especially in a
winner<00:03:26.470> the<00:03:28.230> lead<00:03:29.230> inside<00:03:29.709> it's<00:03:30.180> very<00:03:31.180> hard<00:03:31.660> to

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
winner the lead inside it's very hard to

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.330 
winner the lead inside it's very hard to
a<00:03:33.359> little<00:03:34.359> bit<00:03:34.450> stiff<00:03:34.959> so<00:03:35.590> it<00:03:35.769> drags<00:03:36.069> your

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
a little bit stiff so it drags your

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.339 
a little bit stiff so it drags your
eyelid<00:03:37.150> around<00:03:37.540> so<00:03:37.750> i<00:03:37.810> don't<00:03:38.079> really<00:03:38.230> like

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:38.349 
eyelid around so i don't really like

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:41.550 
eyelid around so i don't really like
that<00:03:38.739> however<00:03:39.609> with<00:03:39.819> these<00:03:40.060> ones<00:03:40.389> it's<00:03:40.720> still

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
that however with these ones it's still

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.339 
that however with these ones it's still
a<00:03:41.739> gel<00:03:42.160> consistency<00:03:42.459> it's<00:03:43.239> just<00:03:43.480> a<00:03:43.599> bit<00:03:44.019> drier

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:44.349 
a gel consistency it's just a bit drier

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:47.909 
a gel consistency it's just a bit drier
what<00:03:45.250> you<00:03:45.340> can<00:03:45.519> do<00:03:45.700> is<00:03:45.910> just<00:03:46.290> throw<00:03:47.290> it<00:03:47.500> roughly

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:47.919 
what you can do is just throw it roughly

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:50.099 
what you can do is just throw it roughly
on<00:03:48.220> your<00:03:48.430> lashline<00:03:48.819> doesn't<00:03:49.540> have<00:03:49.630> to<00:03:49.750> be<00:03:49.900> very

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:50.109 
on your lashline doesn't have to be very

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:53.490 
on your lashline doesn't have to be very
exact<00:03:50.650> and<00:03:50.919> then<00:03:51.459> go<00:03:51.669> back<00:03:52.109> just<00:03:53.109> keep<00:03:53.349> on

exact and then go back just keep on
blending<00:03:53.799> it<00:03:54.129> it's<00:03:54.310> kind<00:03:54.549> of<00:03:54.579> like<00:03:54.669> smudging

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239
