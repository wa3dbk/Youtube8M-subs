okay it's a balancing act just pull the

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.570 
okay it's a balancing act just pull the
hand<00:00:07.740> pump<00:00:07.920> out<00:00:08.570> I'm<00:00:09.570> going<00:00:09.720> to<00:00:09.780> set<00:00:09.930> it<00:00:10.050> down

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:10.580 
hand pump out I'm going to set it down

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.920 
hand pump out I'm going to set it down
it's<00:00:11.580> full<00:00:11.790> of<00:00:11.910> water<00:00:12.059> so<00:00:12.240> it's<00:00:12.480> a<00:00:12.540> little<00:00:12.690> bit

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:12.930 
it's full of water so it's a little bit

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:18.080 
it's full of water so it's a little bit
of<00:00:14.540> pain<00:00:15.540> in<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:15.750> neck<00:00:15.900> here<00:00:16.279> okay<00:00:17.279> so<00:00:17.849> that's

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
of pain in the neck here okay so that's

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.359 
of pain in the neck here okay so that's
it<00:00:18.360> and<00:00:19.230> this<00:00:19.380> is<00:00:19.590> shallow<00:00:19.830> well<00:00:20.660> but<00:00:22.369> all

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
it and this is shallow well but all

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:31.400 
it and this is shallow well but all
there<00:00:23.550> is<00:00:23.670> to<00:00:23.910> it<00:00:27.470> right<00:00:28.470> now<00:00:29.869> the<00:00:30.869> water<00:00:31.080> drain

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
there is to it right now the water drain

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.000 
there is to it right now the water drain
out<00:00:31.439> of<00:00:31.740> it

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:32.010 
out of it

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.450 
out of it
I<00:00:33.410> cut<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.440> slot<00:00:34.680> in<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.920> side<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.250> see<00:00:35.370> the

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
I cut a slot in the side to see the

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.819 
I cut a slot in the side to see the
water<00:00:35.640> coming<00:00:35.910> out<00:00:36.120> cuz<00:00:36.960> if<00:00:37.230> you<00:00:37.260> pump<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.649> lot

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
water coming out cuz if you pump a lot

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.479 
water coming out cuz if you pump a lot
really<00:00:38.070> fast<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.850> water<00:00:39.000> kind<00:00:39.360> of<00:00:39.770> I<00:00:40.770> don't

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
really fast the water kind of I don't

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:42.950 
really fast the water kind of I don't
have<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:41.640> good<00:00:41.790> seal<00:00:42.059> on<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.329> top<00:00:42.360> I'll<00:00:42.690> hit<00:00:42.840> you

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
have a good seal on the top I'll hit you

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.510 
have a good seal on the top I'll hit you
in<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.079> face<00:00:43.110> so<00:00:43.469> I<00:00:43.530> cut<00:00:43.739> that<00:00:43.890> slot<00:00:44.250> in<00:00:44.430> the

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
in the face so I cut that slot in the

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.450 
in the face so I cut that slot in the
side<00:00:44.989> so<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.140> water<00:00:46.350> will<00:00:46.559> drain<00:00:46.860> out<00:00:47.100> that

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
side so the water will drain out that

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.760 
side so the water will drain out that
slot<00:00:47.760> before<00:00:48.149> it<00:00:48.360> soaks<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:48.899> so<00:00:49.410> that's<00:00:49.620> my

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
slot before it soaks you so that's my

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.110 
slot before it soaks you so that's my
anti<00:00:50.160> soaking<00:00:50.640> device<00:00:50.940> at<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.110> top<00:00:52.350> so<00:00:53.120> gonna

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
anti soaking device at the top so gonna

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.889 
anti soaking device at the top so gonna
let<00:00:54.329> this<00:00:54.450> drain<00:00:54.750> out

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
let this drain out

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:00.229 
let this drain out
okay<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.020> piston<00:00:58.440> on<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.770> hand<00:00:59.129> pump<00:00:59.370> there's

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
okay the piston on the hand pump there's

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.389 
okay the piston on the hand pump there's
a<00:01:00.300> video<00:01:00.600> I<00:01:00.660> have<00:01:00.989> how<00:01:01.320> you<00:01:01.350> can<00:01:01.530> go<00:01:01.680> back<00:01:01.860> and

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
a video I have how you can go back and

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.790 
a video I have how you can go back and
see<00:01:02.850> if<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:02.969> can<00:01:03.059> find<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:03.420> it's<00:01:03.570> uh<00:01:03.629> I<00:01:04.020> think

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:04.800 
see if you can find it it's uh I think

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.210 
see if you can find it it's uh I think
it's<00:01:05.160> a<00:01:05.430> called<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.450> slap<00:01:06.720> shot<00:01:07.100> kind<00:01:08.100> of

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
it's a called a slap shot kind of

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.040 
it's a called a slap shot kind of
there's<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:08.880> lot<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.149> Pistons<00:01:09.479> out<00:01:09.660> there<00:01:09.840> like

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.050 
there's a lot of Pistons out there like

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:11.870 
there's a lot of Pistons out there like
this<00:01:10.289> and<00:01:10.800> I<00:01:10.979> just<00:01:11.009> made<00:01:11.399> it<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.580> little<00:01:11.789> bit

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
this and I just made it a little bit

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.090 
this and I just made it a little bit
different<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.539> then<00:01:13.259> instead<00:01:13.560> of<00:01:13.619> putting

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
different and then instead of putting

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.370 
different and then instead of putting
the<00:01:14.610> gaskets<00:01:15.119> right<00:01:15.509> next<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:15.840> each<00:01:15.959> other<00:01:16.289> I

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
the gaskets right next to each other I

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.300 
the gaskets right next to each other I
spread<00:01:16.770> them<00:01:16.890> out

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
spread them out

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.919 
spread them out
I<00:01:17.340> just<00:01:17.789> cut<00:01:18.000> these<00:01:18.119> out<00:01:18.300> of<00:01:18.420> rubber<00:01:18.600> with

00:01:18.919 --> 00:01:18.929 
I just cut these out of rubber with

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:21.589 
I just cut these out of rubber with
scissors<00:01:19.319> a<00:01:20.250> little<00:01:20.670> bit<00:01:20.789> about<00:01:21.360> same

00:01:21.589 --> 00:01:21.599 
scissors a little bit about same

00:01:21.599 --> 00:01:26.419 
scissors a little bit about same
diameter<00:01:21.869> as<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.200> ID<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:24.450> two-inch<00:01:24.810> PVC<00:01:25.429> I

00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:26.429 
diameter as the ID of the two-inch PVC I

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:30.680 
diameter as the ID of the two-inch PVC I
use<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:27.030> inch<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.569> a<00:01:27.660> half<00:01:28.069> coupling<00:01:29.069> and<00:01:29.910> I

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690 
use the inch and a half coupling and I

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.960 
use the inch and a half coupling and I
see<00:01:30.959> it's<00:01:31.110> scraped<00:01:32.099> up<00:01:32.340> looks<00:01:32.550> like<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.700> you

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
see it's scraped up looks like a you

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.070 
see it's scraped up looks like a you
know<00:01:33.000> piston<00:01:33.509> that's<00:01:33.950> been<00:01:34.950> inside<00:01:35.399> a<00:01:36.080> gravel

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
know piston that's been inside a gravel

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.669 
know piston that's been inside a gravel
because<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.069> lot<00:01:38.280> of<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.429> sand<00:01:38.700> is<00:01:39.090> scored<00:01:39.929> the

00:01:40.669 --> 00:01:40.679 
because a lot of the sand is scored the

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:42.589 
because a lot of the sand is scored the
outside<00:01:41.009> but<00:01:41.160> it<00:01:41.250> still<00:01:41.429> functions<00:01:41.640> great<00:01:42.240> so

00:01:42.589 --> 00:01:42.599 
outside but it still functions great so

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:44.779 
outside but it still functions great so
this<00:01:42.929> is<00:01:43.050> a<00:01:43.080> forced<00:01:43.500> pump<00:01:43.770> when<00:01:44.429> you<00:01:44.550> push<00:01:44.759> down

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:44.789 
this is a forced pump when you push down

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:47.510 
this is a forced pump when you push down
with<00:01:45.179> the<00:01:45.479> piston<00:01:45.929> it<00:01:46.259> forces<00:01:46.800> the<00:01:46.950> water<00:01:47.130> to

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
with the piston it forces the water to

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.589 
with the piston it forces the water to
go<00:01:47.729> up<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.539> tube<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:49.050> then<00:01:49.890> when<00:01:50.670> you<00:01:50.970> pick<00:01:51.569> it

00:01:51.589 --> 00:01:51.599 
go up the tube and then when you pick it

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:57.620 
go up the tube and then when you pick it
back<00:01:51.840> up<00:01:51.899> it<00:01:52.530> pulls<00:01:52.920> more<00:01:53.190> water<00:01:53.520> in<00:01:53.989> the<00:01:56.630> foot

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
back up it pulls more water in the foot

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.719 
back up it pulls more water in the foot
valve<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:58.470> homemade<00:01:58.800> foot<00:01:59.009> valve<00:01:59.190> there<00:01:59.520> so

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
valve the homemade foot valve there so

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.309 
valve the homemade foot valve there so
it<00:01:59.819> sucks<00:02:00.060> water<00:02:00.270> in<00:02:00.509> when<00:02:00.660> you<00:02:00.750> pull<00:02:00.959> up<00:02:00.989> and

00:02:01.309 --> 00:02:01.319 
it sucks water in when you pull up and

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:03.020 
it sucks water in when you pull up and
then<00:02:01.770> when<00:02:01.890> you<00:02:01.979> push<00:02:02.190> down<00:02:02.489> and<00:02:02.729> put<00:02:02.880> your

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
then when you push down and put your

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.210 
then when you push down and put your
weight<00:02:03.179> into<00:02:03.390> it<00:02:03.539> you<00:02:04.380> can<00:02:04.560> shoot<00:02:04.739> a<00:02:04.860> stream<00:02:05.099> of

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
weight into it you can shoot a stream of

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.370 
weight into it you can shoot a stream of
water<00:02:05.369> pretty<00:02:05.640> far<00:02:05.940> I've<00:02:06.090> can<00:02:06.450> build<00:02:06.630> 50<00:02:06.929> psi

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
water pretty far I've can build 50 psi

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.580 
water pretty far I've can build 50 psi
with<00:02:07.679> it<00:02:07.830> and<00:02:07.979> then<00:02:08.700> I've<00:02:08.819> got<00:02:09.000> a<00:02:09.560> check<00:02:10.560> valve

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
with it and then I've got a check valve

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.550 
with it and then I've got a check valve
to<00:02:10.920> keep<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.160> water<00:02:11.569> up<00:02:12.569> in<00:02:13.019> the<00:02:13.200> in<00:02:13.379> the

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
to keep the water up in the in the

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.589 
to keep the water up in the in the
handle<00:02:13.890> to<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.069> top<00:02:14.340> so<00:02:15.150> this<00:02:15.269> is<00:02:15.420> worked

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
handle to the top so this is worked

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.420 
handle to the top so this is worked
pretty<00:02:15.719> good<00:02:15.840> and<00:02:16.290> I<00:02:16.439> like<00:02:16.620> spreading<00:02:17.099> out<00:02:17.310> the

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
pretty good and I like spreading out the

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.350 
pretty good and I like spreading out the
gaskets<00:02:17.879> because<00:02:18.030> it's

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
gaskets because it's

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.450 
gaskets because it's
aybe<00:02:18.420> Eliza's<00:02:18.960> the<00:02:19.170> piston<00:02:19.560> in<00:02:20.070> the<00:02:20.310> cylinder

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
aybe Eliza's the piston in the cylinder

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.180 
aybe Eliza's the piston in the cylinder
so<00:02:21.030> anyway<00:02:21.570> this<00:02:22.140> is<00:02:22.350> the<00:02:22.440> hand<00:02:22.620> pump<00:02:22.800> I've<00:02:23.040> had

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
so anyway this is the hand pump I've had

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.160 
so anyway this is the hand pump I've had
it<00:02:23.310> in<00:02:23.400> over<00:02:23.610> a<00:02:23.640> year<00:02:23.700> and<00:02:24.060> four<00:02:24.480> months<00:02:24.690> now

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.920 
it in over a year and four months now
and<00:02:25.380> I<00:02:26.010> just<00:02:26.190> pulled<00:02:26.400> it<00:02:26.520> out<00:02:26.610> because<00:02:27.600> I<00:02:27.720> want

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
and I just pulled it out because I want

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.450 
and I just pulled it out because I want
to<00:02:27.960> show<00:02:28.110> you<00:02:28.200> another<00:02:28.350> pump<00:02:28.710> but<00:02:29.220> for<00:02:29.370> now

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
to show you another pump but for now

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.070 
to show you another pump but for now
this<00:02:29.670> is<00:02:29.730> just<00:02:30.000> I<00:02:30.210> want<00:02:30.390> to<00:02:30.510> show<00:02:30.660> you<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:30.900> hand

this is just I want to show you the hand

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.690 
this is just I want to show you the hand
pump<00:02:31.380> some<00:02:31.620> people<00:02:31.830> have<00:02:31.950> asked<00:02:32.250> about<00:02:32.310> this

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.260 
$500.00 and you've got a very good water
system<00:02:46.380> that<00:02:47.370> will<00:02:47.459> work<00:02:47.580> for<00:02:47.820> years<00:02:48.030> and

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
pump back in the hand wheel I haven't

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.740 
pump back in the hand wheel I haven't
screwed<00:03:04.290> all<00:03:04.470> the<00:03:04.709> parts<00:03:05.250> together<00:03:05.660> but<00:03:06.660> it

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
screwed all the parts together but it

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.449 
screwed all the parts together but it
you<00:03:06.959> know<00:03:07.080> takes<00:03:07.350> no<00:03:07.560> time<00:03:07.800> at<00:03:07.860> all<00:03:08.010> you<00:03:08.310> can

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
see because I didn't pull all the parts

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:16.540 
see because I didn't pull all the parts
together<00:03:11.660> but<00:03:12.660> it's<00:03:12.810> so<00:03:12.930> easy<00:03:12.959> to<00:03:13.489> you<00:03:14.489> can<00:03:14.640> see
