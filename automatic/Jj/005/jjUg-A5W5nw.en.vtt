here<00:01:11.200> is<00:01:11.290> we're<00:01:11.500> doing<00:01:11.590> triplicates<00:01:12.160> spotting

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
here is we're doing triplicates spotting

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:13.710 
here is we're doing triplicates spotting
offsetting<00:01:13.270> at<00:01:13.360> one<00:01:13.450> hundred<00:01:13.510> and

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.390 
offsetting at one hundred and
seventy-five<00:01:14.140> microns<00:01:15.900> using<00:01:16.900> four<00:01:17.200> pins<00:01:17.500> so

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 
seventy-five microns using four pins so

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.690 
seventy-five microns using four pins so
we<00:01:18.520> printed<00:01:18.880> to<00:01:18.970> all<00:01:19.120> fourteen<00:01:19.630> slides<00:01:20.700> and

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
we printed to all fourteen slides and

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.970 
we printed to all fourteen slides and
now<00:01:22.120> the<00:01:23.020> pins<00:01:23.260> are<00:01:23.410> going<00:01:23.560> to<00:01:23.620> get<00:01:23.740> cleaned

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:23.980 
now the pins are going to get cleaned

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:28.609 
now the pins are going to get cleaned
and<00:01:24.130> dried<00:01:24.310> again<00:01:26.100> so<00:01:27.100> there's<00:01:27.310> the<00:01:27.550> dry<00:01:27.910> step

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
and dried again so there's the dry step

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.090 
and dried again so there's the dry step
there's<00:01:29.619> the<00:01:29.800> wash<00:01:31.680> we<00:01:32.680> typically<00:01:32.950> do

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
there's the wash we typically do

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.469 
there's the wash we typically do

go<00:01:52.830> back<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.310> slides<00:01:53.610> we<00:01:54.299> offset<00:01:54.650> 175

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
go back to the slides we offset 175

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.090 
go back to the slides we offset 175
microns<00:01:56.159> again<00:01:56.580> and<00:01:57.409> we<00:01:58.409> keep<00:01:58.619> building<00:01:58.860> our

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
so each 384-well plate of samples takes

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.789
