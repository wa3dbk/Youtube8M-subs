these where I have little grooves in
them<00:01:07.590> which<00:01:08.250> stops<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.610> brake<00:01:08.850> pads<00:01:09.150> from

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
them which stops the brake pads from

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.039 
them which stops the brake pads from
returning<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.350> they<00:01:10.439> bind<00:01:10.700> so<00:01:11.869> this<00:01:12.869> one

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
tricky bit what I got here is a pair of

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:58.310 
tricky bit what I got here is a pair of
pin<00:01:52.380> up<00:01:52.680> in<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:54.439> piston<00:01:55.610> pushes<00:01:57.320> basically

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
pin up in the piston pushes basically

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.709 
pin up in the piston pushes basically
it's<00:01:58.439> plays<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:59.040> what's<00:01:59.369> place<00:01:59.640> pushes<00:02:00.600> the

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
it's plays the what's place pushes the

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.160 
it's plays the what's place pushes the
piston<00:02:00.930> back<00:02:01.140> into<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.860> hairs<00:02:02.070> in<00:02:02.310> so<00:02:02.640> I<00:02:03.170> don't

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
piston back into the hairs in so I don't

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.450 
piston back into the hairs in so I don't
know<00:02:04.229> if<00:02:04.290> I'm<00:02:04.380> going<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.590> be<00:02:04.680> I<00:02:04.740> do<00:02:04.950> this<00:02:05.189> with

now can't do it one hand one second so
I've<00:02:14.500> got<00:02:14.680> it<00:02:14.710> wedged<00:02:14.980> in<00:02:15.250> there

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
I've got it wedged in there

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.530 
I've got it wedged in there
luckily<00:02:17.100> the<00:02:18.100> edge<00:02:18.220> of<00:02:18.370> this<00:02:18.430> blade<00:02:18.760> here<00:02:19.150> is

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
luckily the edge of this blade here is

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.040 
luckily the edge of this blade here is
going<00:02:20.110> to<00:02:20.170> miss<00:02:20.670> the<00:02:21.670> man<00:02:21.910> it's<00:02:22.810> going<00:02:22.990> to

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
going to miss the man it's going to

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
going to miss the man it's going to
catch<00:02:23.230> the<00:02:23.440> piston<00:02:23.920> and<00:02:24.100> the<00:02:25.030> other<00:02:25.180> side

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
catch the piston and the other side

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.130 
catch the piston and the other side

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
onto the pin pushed it halfway through

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.320 
onto the pin pushed it halfway through
just<00:04:51.940> so<00:04:52.840> it's<00:04:52.990> virtually<00:04:53.470> level<00:04:54.210> with<00:04:55.210> the

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
just so it's virtually level with the

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.480 
just so it's virtually level with the
disc<00:04:55.650> switch<00:04:56.650> it<00:04:56.800> back<00:04:56.920> in<00:04:57.130> there<00:04:57.310> a<00:04:57.340> little
