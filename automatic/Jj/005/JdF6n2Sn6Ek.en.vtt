00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
ordered the warm white and apparently

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.019 
ordered the warm white and apparently
this<00:00:19.140> takes<00:00:19.350> only<00:00:19.529> 5<00:00:19.859> watts<00:00:20.189> as<00:00:20.460> compared<00:00:20.939> to

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
this takes only 5 watts as compared to

this takes only 5 watts as compared to
an<00:00:21.420> incandescent<00:00:21.840> bulb<00:00:22.470> and<00:00:22.830> they're<00:00:23.820> saying

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
an incandescent bulb and they're saying

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.700 
an incandescent bulb and they're saying
that<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.359> output<00:00:24.689> is<00:00:24.720> equivalent<00:00:25.080> to<00:00:25.260> a<00:00:25.350> 40

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
that the output is equivalent to a 40

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.080

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
put in in the video though you cannot

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.690 
put in in the video though you cannot
make<00:01:48.509> out<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:49.049> difference<00:01:49.229> in<00:01:49.829> in<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.460> light

light so what Philips has done is for
the<00:01:56.729> LEDs<00:01:57.270> they<00:01:57.659> have<00:01:57.899> given<00:01:58.770> a<00:01:58.890> they<00:01:59.700> have

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
the LEDs they have given a they have

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.289 
the LEDs they have given a they have
given<00:02:00.500> 2700<00:02:01.500> Kelvin<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.130> what<00:02:02.909> you<00:02:03.030> would<00:02:03.180> be

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
given 2700 Kelvin and what you would be

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.520 
given 2700 Kelvin and what you would be
used<00:02:03.570> to<00:02:03.780> is<00:02:03.930> a<00:02:03.960> 3000<00:02:04.770> Kelvin<00:02:06.079> 3000<00:02:07.079> Kelvin<00:02:07.409> is

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
used to is a 3000 Kelvin 3000 Kelvin is

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.160 
used to is a 3000 Kelvin 3000 Kelvin is
a<00:02:07.560> little<00:02:07.979> bit<00:02:08.310> more<00:02:08.640> yellow<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.270> if<00:02:09.810> you<00:02:10.020> can

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
a little bit more yellow and if you can

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.980 
a little bit more yellow and if you can
notice<00:02:10.530> from<00:02:10.560> the

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
notice from the

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.290 
notice from the
the<00:02:12.110> bulb<00:02:12.350> the<00:02:12.950> center<00:02:13.280> bulb<00:02:13.490> is<00:02:13.700> a<00:02:13.730> little<00:02:14.150> bit

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
the bulb the center bulb is a little bit

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.090 
the bulb the center bulb is a little bit
more<00:02:14.450> yellow<00:02:14.870> than<00:02:15.020> the<00:02:15.200> other<00:02:15.350> two<00:02:15.590> bulbs<00:02:15.830> on

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
more yellow than the other two bulbs on

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.030 
more yellow than the other two bulbs on
the<00:02:16.250> left<00:02:16.490> and<00:02:16.700> the<00:02:16.790> right<00:02:17.590> from<00:02:18.590> a<00:02:18.680> light

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
the left and the right from a light

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.620 
the left and the right from a light
output<00:02:19.670> point<00:02:20.000> of<00:02:20.210> view<00:02:20.420> I<00:02:20.660> did<00:02:21.380> love<00:02:21.590> the<00:02:21.650> LEDs

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
output point of view I did love the LEDs

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.290 
output point of view I did love the LEDs
they<00:02:23.630> provide<00:02:24.080> the<00:02:24.230> same<00:02:24.500> output<00:02:24.830> as<00:02:25.310> the<00:02:25.340> 11

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
they provide the same output as the 11

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.590 
they provide the same output as the 11
watt<00:02:26.540> CFL<00:02:27.380> as<00:02:27.980> before<00:02:28.760> so<00:02:28.910> even<00:02:29.270> though<00:02:29.390> I<00:02:29.420> have

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
watt CFL as before so even though I have

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.990 
watt CFL as before so even though I have
replaced<00:02:29.870> all<00:02:30.200> three<00:02:30.860> with<00:02:31.160> three<00:02:31.340> LED<00:02:31.820> bulbs

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
replaced all three with three LED bulbs

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.570 
replaced all three with three LED bulbs
I<00:02:32.390> did<00:02:33.290> find<00:02:33.560> that<00:02:33.650> the<00:02:33.800> light<00:02:33.950> output<00:02:34.220> is

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
I did find that the light output is

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.670 
I did find that the light output is
almost<00:02:34.880> similar<00:02:35.170> although<00:02:36.170> I<00:02:36.200> like<00:02:36.500> the

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
almost similar although I like the

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.620 
almost similar although I like the
Philips<00:02:36.980> light<00:02:37.190> better<00:02:37.580> so<00:02:38.240> this<00:02:38.420> is<00:02:38.510> my

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
Philips light better so this is my

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.140 
Philips light better so this is my
review<00:02:38.930> of<00:02:38.990> the<00:02:39.410> philips<00:02:40.010> LED<00:02:40.520> bulbs<00:02:40.880> which

buying<00:02:49.010> this<00:02:49.280> bulb<00:02:49.490> I<00:02:49.640> think<00:02:49.850> it's<00:02:49.970> a<00:02:50.030> great

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
buying this bulb I think it's a great

buying this bulb I think it's a great
it's<00:02:50.630> a<00:02:50.840> great<00:02:50.960> bulb<00:02:51.320> I<00:02:51.530> got<00:02:52.190> mine<00:02:52.460> off<00:02:52.700> of

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
it's a great bulb I got mine off of

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.080 
it's a great bulb I got mine off of
Amazon<00:02:53.990> I<00:02:54.140> did<00:02:54.590> find<00:02:54.830> them<00:02:55.010> for<00:02:55.160> quite<00:02:55.340> quite

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
Amazon I did find them for quite quite

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.670 
Amazon I did find them for quite quite
cheap<00:02:56.390> online<00:02:57.580> so<00:02:58.580> in<00:02:58.730> comparison<00:02:59.180> as<00:02:59.960> against

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
cheap online so in comparison as against

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.800 
cheap online so in comparison as against
using<00:03:00.830> 33<00:03:01.550> Watts<00:03:01.790> earlier<00:03:02.120> right<00:03:02.450> now<00:03:02.660> I'm

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
using 33 Watts earlier right now I'm

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.530 
using 33 Watts earlier right now I'm
running<00:03:02.990> it<00:03:03.230> on<00:03:03.350> 15<00:03:03.800> 15<00:03:04.730> watts<00:03:04.970> which<00:03:05.210> is<00:03:05.330> quite

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
running it on 15 15 watts which is quite

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:06.940 
running it on 15 15 watts which is quite
a<00:03:05.570> bit<00:03:05.840> of<00:03:05.960> saving<00:03:06.290> and<00:03:06.410> I<00:03:06.440> think<00:03:06.680> I<00:03:06.770> can

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
a bit of saving and I think I can

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.560 
a bit of saving and I think I can
recover<00:03:07.220> my<00:03:07.520> money<00:03:07.760> in<00:03:07.910> the<00:03:08.030> next<00:03:08.270> two<00:03:08.390> months

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
recover my money in the next two months

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.950 
recover my money in the next two months
