store more than two cars and the grocery
garage<00:01:10.439> but<00:01:10.830> I<00:01:11.040> choose<00:01:11.670> not<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:12.030> do<00:01:12.150> that<00:01:12.360> for<00:01:12.570> a

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
garage but I choose not to do that for a

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.090 
garage but I choose not to do that for a
while<00:01:12.780> because<00:01:13.020> otherwise<00:01:13.320> you<00:01:13.799> have<00:01:13.830> this

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
while because otherwise you have this

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.940 
while because otherwise you have this
risk<00:01:14.460> of<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.820> vehicles<00:01:15.330> being<00:01:15.570> eaten<00:01:15.950> so

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
risk of the vehicles being eaten so

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.560 
risk of the vehicles being eaten so
before<00:01:17.280> you<00:01:17.460> save<00:01:17.790> you'd<00:01:18.000> have<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.330> check

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
before you save you'd have to check

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.560 
before you save you'd have to check
every<00:01:18.960> garage<00:01:19.170> again<00:01:19.500> so<00:01:20.490> it's<00:01:21.299> your<00:01:21.540> choice

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
every garage again so it's your choice

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.480 
every garage again so it's your choice
but<00:01:21.840> i<00:01:22.229> think<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:22.530> should<00:01:22.619> definitely<00:01:22.979> earn

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
but i think you should definitely earn

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.550 
but i think you should definitely earn
some<00:01:23.790> money<00:01:23.880> by<00:01:24.420> doing<00:01:24.450> some<00:01:24.990> of<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.200> extra

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
some money by doing some of the extra

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.260 
some money by doing some of the extra
missions<00:01:25.710> like<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.280> taxi<00:01:26.670> driver<00:01:26.700> the

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
missions like the taxi driver the

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.990 
missions like the taxi driver the
firefighter<00:01:27.810> pimping<00:01:28.470> etc<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.700> then<00:01:29.820> just

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
firefighter pimping etc and then just

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.940 
firefighter pimping etc and then just
buy<00:01:30.180> some<00:01:30.450> garage<00:01:30.780> space<00:01:31.079> there's<00:01:31.710> also
