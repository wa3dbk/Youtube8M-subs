00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 yes hello together very warmly 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.670
 Welcome to a new project of 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.220
 and with around broke 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.450
 Yes, I would like to give you a new one today 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.450
 show format 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.490
 I would all just once fabrikat 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.279
 call 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:19.949
 Of course , there are already things 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.240
 they are as small as possible and built 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.680
 Now, for example, a chicken farm 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.619
 there are only a few 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:32.910
 blocks big I thought so nice 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:34.790
 works too but somehow looks 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.960
 that does not matter 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.300
 and now it's just like this 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.760
 this new format where i just go 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.800
 They may be smaller, too 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.110
 build that maybe it looks like 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.149
 a factory or something like something 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.449
 a bit so based on the reality 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:54.570
 is where you still so individual processes 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.340
 recognizes as in the right factory and 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.649
 so here's my variant, so to speak 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.160
 a chicken farm I'll show you for it 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.769
 that whole is built up here 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.409
 so to speak, the leech battery there are quite 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.260
 many chickens in it 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:12.240
 the eggs lay eggs fall in here 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.150
 These dispensers are there as well 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.880
 a few pieces in there if I am now 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.140
 switch off this switch would be there would be 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.689
 I always have them out now 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.119
 again so switched to a 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.720
 Couple he collect 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:32.340
 if I turn it out then they will fire 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:34.619
 Dispenser automatically shuts off the eggs like that 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.430
 that down here in this run 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.299
 always had a few chickens to collect 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:45.450
 as we wait for that 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:47.729
 gone through is right over when in 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.770
 the displays are no longer in there 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.780
 are then the automatic 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.299
 switched off since this timer 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.729
 always works only if there is also a 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.409
 This means that it is always only when he is in it 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.229
 these displays are in there too 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.530
 controlled then fall so the chickens 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.320
 down here 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.450
 and are in this treadmill or in 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.520
 this run or we call that 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.770
 want in there 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.959
 Of course we need some time to 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:17.230
 the adults are a bit man 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:19.750
 feathers and meat from, so to speak 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.459
 That's why I get the whole thing 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.459
 with a daylight sensor 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.140
 linked and so to speak, of which 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.060
 depending on this brightly dark 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.880
 change whenever it gets dark 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.470
 has become and then bright again 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.440
 This treadmill will always be one 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.360
 position further forward it shows 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.850
 I'm just there for you this is this 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.650
 I can either sensor here now 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.780
 make dark and then hereby again 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.190
 but it should not be bright 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.570
 work because then I have such a 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.000
 There is a small mechanism in it for that 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:51.940
 makes sure that day is always but I can 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.300
 this brightly dark change just now 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.910
 times with this button symbol simulate 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:03.580
 and then you will see how the whole 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:06.209
 So it always works around you 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.680
 Position brought forward 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:11.549
 then you see how the chickens then 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.690
 fall down and be processed there 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:16.030
 Now I'll do it again 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:19.650
 then I fly over it then see 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.650
 you also how that works in detail 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:25.380
 So the chickens fall in here then 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.880
 is lover activated the lava goes 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.600
 directly back away the chickens begin 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.190
 to burn 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:33.570
 that means the meat we get 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:35.280
 is also cooked automatically and everything 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.470
 Together then the ground goes away for a moment 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.480
 and mistakes and flesh fall down 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:43.170
 and that will all be in this box 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:45.090
 should be sorted accidentally again 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.050
 a baby 100 in it for that is the 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.060
 lay down here 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:50.010
 that means the baby chickens will be there in 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.360
 the lava did not burn that up 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.580
 once an incredible number of 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.380
 animals congested and somehow the world 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:59.460
 it makes me laugh , unfortunately 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:01.980
 happened once since I've been around the 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:04.170
 switch had not been deactivated and there 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.550
 this world has always happened bright 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.290
 Of course, no dark change 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.850
 that means there were somehow in front 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.030
 a few hundred animals in it and that has 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.230
 brought my whole world to live 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.690
 that means there you should pay attention 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.160
 that if you have that in operation he has 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.960
 not somehow so mechanism too 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.700
 he has simply made sure of it 

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:22.550
 that it is always bright then it can 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.170
 something happens up there 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:29.160
 accumulated and are only incredible number 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:32.470
 of animals in shows up, we show 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:34.690
 just do it again that is 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.990
 depending on the case will be down 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:40.300
 set on fire 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:43.240
 of course everything is shared appropriately and the 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.700
 Whole things fall down and you see 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.680
 the meat is already cooked to it 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:50.380
 are there again a few if 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.910
 then should experience a high again 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.100
 you get the hold below everything in the 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:57.250
 box 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:59.590
 yes, so to speak, my variant of the 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.120
 driving chicken fan or munich 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.820
 I hope one or the other 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:06.700
 I 'm always happy about it 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:09.130
 if you the videos shows the green 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:11.890
 thumbs then I always know 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:14.200
 what you like and what not then 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:17.320
 I also steer in a bit 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:18.550
 which direction i do the videos i do 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.650
 I'm always happy when you see me 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.870
 further recommends and the audience 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.970
 Of course, it gets bigger, so to speak 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.710
 nice for me if under the videos 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:27.640
 always comments are what you still have 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.350
 could do better 

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.419
 Of course, I am also happy about that 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:35.160
 so thanks for watching 

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:35.160
 until next time ciao
