00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.699
 Hello and welcome I am Niko of the car monkey monkeys 

00:00:02.699 --> 00:00:08.669
 Today we want to show you how to clean your door hinges and hinges properly 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:28.349
 For cleaning, we use a household Kärcher so no special machine 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:29.439
 for dresser 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:33.420
 this is the Kärcher SC1020 we link you again below, if 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.360
 you want to have a look 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.820
 we have 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.810
 different essays 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.360
 basically it looks like .. 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.560
 then we have a small essay, for tight spots 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.690
 and if you really want to make space 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.700
 is in the interior also great, we show you again 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.480
 could sometimes 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.970
 Son big up here. 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.020
 then you have a little more space, but come around here 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.090
 otherwise you will not see anything 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.240
 Let's start ... 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:04.930
 basically there is to say we use our APC here 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.570
 in the mix 1:10 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.140
 steam cleaners 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.250
 First of all, let's start with the dirty hinges here 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.540
 spray with APC 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.170
 and let that act a little bit 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.990
 we do not have to do more work than we need, so APC can work on it 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.800
 It came a nice note from a dear spectator 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.350
 He pointed out that when making the entrances is indeed one of the entrances 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.660
 That maybe before doing the laundry is quite clever because we are using the APC 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.250
 Sometimes you spray through or 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.740
 where else comes with his spray so it is on clean paint 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.110
 is a good note, just make sure that you rub with the microfiber cloth when wiping not pber the paint 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.700
 then you'll get a scratch if it's dirty 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.310
 so now we start first, first look 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.940
 that here too 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:55.940
 In the tub, the water is going on and then just spray everything with steam 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.920
 as an indication in advance 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.150
 you have to grease hinges after cleaning! 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.379
 because the fat gets her down with the cleaning 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:16.120
 if you do not have a steam cleaner, you only work with APC 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.879
 that works only medium APC in several rounds 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:21.139
 Raising APC 

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:23.599
 then we take one 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:25.089
 brush 

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:30.279
 and brush as much as possible 

00:02:30.279 --> 00:02:32.069
 the areas 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.509
 as I said the steam cleaner is optional, it is easier 

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:36.979
 and also a bit more thorough 

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:40.249
 but with a little patience and leisure, you can do it without a steam cleaner 

00:02:40.249 --> 00:02:43.259
 so do not be discouraged just because you do not have a steam cleaner 

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:46.829
 is not necessarily necessary but is my favorite method because it 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:48.059
 goes faster 

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:50.229
 and also cleaner 

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:53.339
 as we said now in the second step, we try everything to brush it off 

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:55.219
 what we create .. 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:03.959
 sometimes it is a bit tight like this car 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:09.589
 ... genau..soo ... 

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:12.979
 if you have the time, we take off first with a cloth 

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:15.919
 so that we also have an intermediate result 

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:21.469
 what is down so everything 

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:25.119
 It is completely dried and encrusted here in the car 

00:03:25.119 --> 00:03:26.509
 I think that was here 

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:33.509
 never done 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:42.619
 Do not be surprised that my cloth is already dirty here, I have already used in the interior 

00:03:42.619 --> 00:03:45.369
 you can do a so-called 

00:03:45.369 --> 00:03:49.089
 Dirt cloth do not use your best cloth 

00:03:49.089 --> 00:03:51.549
 but a microfiber cloth 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:55.099
 that has become hard or not really clean 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:58.229
 Look at them, put them in an extra box 

00:03:58.229 --> 00:04:05.229
 and uses those for such dirty work 

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:12.199
 so then we could first look at the result 

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:15.579
 and we have to make a second round 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:16.549
 or start the whole thing from scratch 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:17.420
 depending on 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.139
 I do it now, I take my steam cleaner 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:24.749
 I wrap the microfiber cloth around there 

00:04:24.749 --> 00:04:28.059
 so and then I work with it after a little bit in between 

00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:34.069
 to remove some dirt when working with the hot steam 

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:44.860
 soo and then it starts .. watch out is very hot! 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:51.409
 do not hurt yourself 

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:58.409
 You can also wrap a rubber drum 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:13.860
 so 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.800
 then we take another cloth because this is now wet and already relatively dirty 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.210
 and wipe again 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.020
 as I said that is not here now .. 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.819
 you can not say flat rate how long you need it is always on the 

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:26.960
 Hinges on 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.180
 Just make repeated steps as often and as long as your hinges 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.270
 are clean 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.680
 And if you do that regularly, it will not take that long either 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.819
 then most APC spraying - brushing - wipe off 

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:44.270
 before the laundry and the door is done! as I said remember .. 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:45.969
 make before the laundry 

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:47.990
 the 

00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:51.360
 Grease hinges again 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.680
 best you take 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.930
 a grease for brushing, so no spray grease 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.539
 then our hinges are clean 

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:08.389
 So we can continue on all doors until we are done with it 

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:10.320
 otherwise it was the first for today
