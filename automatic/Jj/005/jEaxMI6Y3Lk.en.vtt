let me just lift up position use a

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:14.840 
let me just lift up position use a
couple<00:00:56.010> bolts<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.430> hold<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:56.940> in<00:00:57.030> place<00:01:13.850> those

kind<00:01:15.090> of<00:01:15.119> you<00:01:15.210> can't<00:01:15.420> it's<00:01:15.600> hard<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:15.840> see<00:01:16.080> what

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
kind of you can't it's hard to see what

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.139 
kind of you can't it's hard to see what
the<00:01:16.619> hitch<00:01:16.770> is<00:01:16.950> actually<00:01:17.369> probably<00:01:17.759> then

00:01:18.139 --> 00:01:18.149 
the hitch is actually probably then

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:19.760 
the hitch is actually probably then
tweaked<00:01:18.509> in<00:01:18.690> a<00:01:18.780> little<00:01:18.990> bit<00:01:19.080> this<00:01:19.290> way<00:01:19.500> for

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
tweaked in a little bit this way for

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:20.960 
tweaked in a little bit this way for
whatever<00:01:19.890> reason<00:01:20.340> shipping<00:01:20.759> they've
