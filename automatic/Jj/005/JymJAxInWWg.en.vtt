00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.830
 ordinary deck of cards and now we 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.250

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:27.599
 decks can be scrolled and 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:33.600

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:07.519
 at the top 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:10.910

 not necessary cards you got to get 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:28.889
 Card Well now it is you have and 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:31.560

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.090
 slowly see something here you can see two 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:00.230
 the cards are now not the top five peak with the action and

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:08.910
 put this card over and over 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:12.630
 you are the top five and the whole deck seems 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:14.519
 normal well then when the viewer thinks that 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:17.579
 and the top five peak I put it back and the words 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:20.070
 break case under this card 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:22.500
