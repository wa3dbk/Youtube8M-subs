last episode we went through my reading
process<00:00:18.690> how<00:00:18.900> I<00:00:18.930> take<00:00:19.289> raw<00:00:19.619> information<00:00:20.250> and

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
about that because reading is just one

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.939 
about that because reading is just one
mechanism<00:00:27.420> actually<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:28.260> input<00:00:28.740> information

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
my process and I showed you how we use

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.060 
my process and I showed you how we use
the<00:00:33.600> guillotine<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.469> scanner<00:00:34.770> and

ability to get more information in in a

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.490 
ability to get more information in in a
faster<00:00:41.670> way<00:00:41.790> so<00:00:42.540> today<00:00:42.960> I<00:00:42.989> want<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.290> tell<00:00:43.379> you

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
faster way so today I want to tell you

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.990 
faster way so today I want to tell you
about<00:00:43.590> some<00:00:43.860> other<00:00:44.010> software<00:00:44.489> that<00:00:44.579> I<00:00:44.730> use

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
about some other software that I use

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.760 
about some other software that I use
that's<00:00:45.239> been<00:00:45.480> very<00:00:45.719> helpful<00:00:45.809> in<00:00:46.230> instrumental

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
that's been very helpful in instrumental

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.889 
that's been very helpful in instrumental
and<00:00:47.010> me<00:00:47.579> being<00:00:47.850> able<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.120> process<00:00:48.390> more

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
and me being able to process more

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.069 
and me being able to process more
information<00:00:49.620> faster<00:00:50.309> so<00:00:50.910> quick<00:00:51.660> reader<00:00:51.870> is

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
information faster so quick reader is

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.830 
information faster so quick reader is
for<00:00:52.440> reading<00:00:52.770> but<00:00:53.370> there's<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.670> great<00:00:54.090> two<00:00:54.600> apps

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
for reading but there's a great two apps

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.520 
for reading but there's a great two apps

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
your iPod at double speed I use these

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.190 
your iPod at double speed I use these
all<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.939> time<00:01:20.970> when<00:01:21.420> I'm<00:01:21.509> learning<00:01:21.720> anything

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
all the time when I'm learning anything

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.670 
all the time when I'm learning anything
on<00:01:22.470> video<00:01:22.619> I'm<00:01:23.009> always<00:01:23.310> using<00:01:23.610> speed<00:01:23.909> up<00:01:24.030> TV

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
on video I'm always using speed up TV

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.800 
on video I'm always using speed up TV
primarily<00:01:25.680> because<00:01:26.310> I<00:01:26.939> find<00:01:27.330> that<00:01:27.420> there's<00:01:27.600> no

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
primarily because I find that there's no

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.810 
primarily because I find that there's no
loss<00:01:28.080> in<00:01:28.380> being<00:01:28.590> able<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.829> go<00:01:29.009> at<00:01:29.280> twice<00:01:29.790> the

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
loss in being able to go at twice the

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.399 
loss in being able to go at twice the
speed<00:01:30.030> I<00:01:30.420> also<00:01:30.659> do<00:01:30.869> this<00:01:30.990> actually<00:01:31.259> when<00:01:31.380> I

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
speed I also do this actually when I

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.080 
speed I also do this actually when I
want<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.710> watch<00:01:31.829> like<00:01:32.130> political<00:01:32.400> shows<00:01:32.790> and

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
want to watch like political shows and

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.940 
want to watch like political shows and
things<00:01:33.329> of<00:01:33.509> that<00:01:33.540> nature<00:01:33.659> I<00:01:34.140> just<00:01:34.500> watch<00:01:34.650> it<00:01:34.680> at

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
things of that nature I just watch it at

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.700 
things of that nature I just watch it at
double<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.189> speed<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.610> I'm<00:01:35.700> able<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:36.710> get

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
double the speed and I'm able to get

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.170 
double the speed and I'm able to get
everything<00:01:37.979> that<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.310> would<00:01:38.549> if<00:01:38.670> I<00:01:38.759> watch<00:01:38.909> it<00:01:39.090> at

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
everything that I would if I watch it at

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.640 
everything that I would if I watch it at
regular<00:01:39.450> speed<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:39.930> just<00:01:40.110> helps<00:01:40.320> me<00:01:40.439> get

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
regular speed and it just helps me get

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.910 
regular speed and it just helps me get
through<00:01:40.799> stuff<00:01:41.040> faster<00:01:41.840> speed<00:01:42.840> up<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.619> speed

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
through stuff faster speed up to speed

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.950 
through stuff faster speed up to speed
up<00:01:44.070> for<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.399> audio<00:01:44.640> same<00:01:45.119> thing<00:01:45.360> I<00:01:45.509> can<00:01:45.570> listen

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
up for the audio same thing I can listen

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.310 
up for the audio same thing I can listen
to<00:01:46.110> audio<00:01:46.710> at<00:01:47.100> this<00:01:47.250> point<00:01:47.490> at<00:01:47.729> about<00:01:47.820> 300%<00:01:48.450> but

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
to audio at this point at about 300% but

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.440 
to audio at this point at about 300% but
speed<00:01:49.710> up<00:01:49.829> only<00:01:50.070> I<00:01:50.159> think<00:01:50.250> goes<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.640> 200%<00:01:51.210> but

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
speed up only I think goes to 200% but

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.300 
speed up only I think goes to 200% but
that's<00:01:51.750> better<00:01:51.990> than<00:01:52.170> going<00:01:52.259> at<00:01:52.439> 100%<00:01:52.799> now

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
that's better than going at 100% now

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.280 
that's better than going at 100% now
that's<00:01:53.790> when<00:01:54.060> I'm<00:01:54.180> mobile<00:01:54.420> when<00:01:54.720> I'm<00:01:54.810> at<00:01:55.020> my

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
called faster audio and faster audio

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.690

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
at a higher speed I find that to be very

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.210

this and the only barrier that you have

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.710 
this and the only barrier that you have
to<00:02:35.430> break<00:02:35.640> through<00:02:35.880> is<00:02:36.030> your<00:02:36.209> willingness<00:02:36.480> to

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
to break through is your willingness to

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.199 
to break through is your willingness to

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
be bad at first to then get better in

other words anything worth doing well is

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:43.460 
other words anything worth doing well is
worth<00:02:41.400> doing<00:02:41.610> poorly<00:02:41.970> at<00:02:42.299> first<00:02:42.630> and<00:02:42.900> you<00:02:42.930> have

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
worth doing poorly at first and you have

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.229 
worth doing poorly at first and you have
to<00:02:43.590> realize<00:02:43.980> that<00:02:44.010> there's<00:02:44.700> going<00:02:44.940> to<00:02:45.060> be<00:02:45.150> a

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
to realize that there's going to be a

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.570 
to realize that there's going to be a
period<00:02:45.510> of<00:02:45.660> time<00:02:45.900> where<00:02:46.530> you<00:02:46.860> are<00:02:47.250> not<00:02:47.519> going

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
period of time where you are not going

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.240 
period of time where you are not going
to<00:02:47.970> comprehend<00:02:48.630> what<00:02:49.200> you<00:02:49.319> would<00:02:49.440> like<00:02:49.590> now

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
to comprehend what you would like now

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.729 
to comprehend what you would like now
the<00:02:50.670> easiest<00:02:51.180> way<00:02:51.360> to<00:02:51.540> actually<00:02:51.870> see<00:02:52.349> this<00:02:52.530> in

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
the easiest way to actually see this in

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.069 
the easiest way to actually see this in
action<00:02:52.980> is<00:02:53.549> with<00:02:53.880> audio<00:02:54.269> for<00:02:54.510> some<00:02:54.690> reason

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
action is with audio for some reason

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:57.860 
action is with audio for some reason
when<00:02:55.560> you<00:02:55.829> your<00:02:56.610> mind<00:02:56.819> adapts<00:02:57.390> very<00:02:57.420> quickly

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
when you your mind adapts very quickly

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.390 
when you your mind adapts very quickly
to<00:02:58.079> audio<00:02:58.380> so<00:02:58.709> what<00:02:58.950> I<00:02:58.980> would<00:02:59.190> strongly

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
to audio so what I would strongly

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.729 
to audio so what I would strongly
recommend<00:02:59.549> is<00:03:00.390> that<00:03:00.780> you<00:03:00.900> take<00:03:01.049> an<00:03:01.200> audio<00:03:01.440> that

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
recommend is that you take an audio that

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:03.440 
recommend is that you take an audio that
you'd<00:03:01.950> like<00:03:02.069> to<00:03:02.190> listen<00:03:02.310> to<00:03:02.579> put<00:03:03.180> it<00:03:03.269> up<00:03:03.360> to

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
you'd like to listen to put it up to

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.509 
you'd like to listen to put it up to
200%<00:03:03.840> now<00:03:04.230> if<00:03:04.319> that's<00:03:04.500> easy<00:03:04.739> for<00:03:04.860> you<00:03:05.130> great

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
200% now if that's easy for you great

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.490 
200% now if that's easy for you great
then<00:03:05.700> just<00:03:05.880> listen<00:03:06.000> to<00:03:06.209> it<00:03:06.239> at<00:03:06.390> 200%<00:03:06.720> but<00:03:07.410> if

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
then just listen to it at 200% but if

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.140 
then just listen to it at 200% but if
it's<00:03:07.620> not<00:03:07.769> just<00:03:08.220> listen<00:03:08.519> to<00:03:08.610> it<00:03:08.700> for<00:03:08.849> a<00:03:08.910> few

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
it's not just listen to it for a few

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.600 
it's not just listen to it for a few
minutes<00:03:09.239> then<00:03:09.930> back<00:03:10.110> it<00:03:10.290> down<00:03:10.380> to<00:03:10.500> 150<00:03:11.220> percent

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
minutes then back it down to 150 percent

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.789 
minutes then back it down to 150 percent
and<00:03:11.790> what<00:03:12.329> you'll<00:03:12.480> see<00:03:12.660> is<00:03:12.750> that<00:03:12.870> 150<00:03:13.349> percent

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
and what you'll see is that 150 percent

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:15.199 
and what you'll see is that 150 percent
will<00:03:13.980> seem<00:03:14.220> really<00:03:14.519> slow<00:03:14.730> it's<00:03:14.880> like<00:03:15.000> if<00:03:15.120> I

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
will seem really slow it's like if I

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.300 
will seem really slow it's like if I
stop<00:03:15.450> this<00:03:15.630> car<00:03:15.870> all<00:03:16.049> of<00:03:16.140> a<00:03:16.200> sudden<00:03:16.500> or<00:03:17.250> I

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
stop this car all of a sudden or I

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.890 
stop this car all of a sudden or I
slowed<00:03:17.819> it<00:03:17.940> down<00:03:17.970> it<00:03:18.359> would<00:03:18.480> seem<00:03:18.660> like<00:03:18.750> I'm

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
slowed it down it would seem like I'm

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.569 
slowed it down it would seem like I'm
going<00:03:19.170> much<00:03:19.350> slower<00:03:19.380> than<00:03:19.889> I<00:03:19.980> actually<00:03:20.160> am

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
going much slower than I actually am

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:22.160 
going much slower than I actually am
it's<00:03:21.060> the<00:03:21.150> same<00:03:21.359> with<00:03:21.510> your<00:03:21.600> mind<00:03:21.810> remember

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
it's the same with your mind remember

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.410 
it's the same with your mind remember
that<00:03:22.650> you<00:03:22.739> have<00:03:22.859> to<00:03:22.980> train<00:03:23.310> yourself<00:03:23.459> to<00:03:23.940> input

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
that you have to train yourself to input

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.330 
that you have to train yourself to input
information<00:03:24.630> faster<00:03:25.500> and<00:03:25.680> the<00:03:26.010> more<00:03:26.220> that

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
information faster and the more that

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.860 
information faster and the more that
you're<00:03:26.489> able<00:03:26.579> to<00:03:26.730> do<00:03:26.940> that<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:27.389> faster<00:03:27.750> you're

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
you're able to do that the faster you're

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.509 
you're able to do that the faster you're
able<00:03:28.079> to<00:03:28.109> go<00:03:28.260> through<00:03:28.440> information<00:03:28.980> and<00:03:29.130> then

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
able to go through information and then

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.940 
able to go through information and then
the<00:03:29.850> more<00:03:30.269> likely<00:03:30.600> it<00:03:31.260> is<00:03:31.319> that<00:03:31.380> you'll<00:03:31.680> put<00:03:31.859> it

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
the more likely it is that you'll put it

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.009 
the more likely it is that you'll put it
into<00:03:32.220> action<00:03:32.370> faster<00:03:33.329> and<00:03:33.480> that's<00:03:33.600> really<00:03:33.900> the

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
into action faster and that's really the

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:35.780 
into action faster and that's really the
big<00:03:34.200> thing<00:03:34.440> you<00:03:34.769> see<00:03:34.950> for<00:03:35.160> me<00:03:35.280> I<00:03:35.489> can<00:03:35.700> go

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
big thing you see for me I can go

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.090 
big thing you see for me I can go
through<00:03:35.940> a<00:03:35.970> whole<00:03:36.209> program<00:03:36.420> in<00:03:36.810> one<00:03:37.200> sitting

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
through a whole program in one sitting

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.309 
through a whole program in one sitting
and<00:03:38.340> by<00:03:38.880> doing<00:03:39.090> so<00:03:39.209> it<00:03:39.359> allows<00:03:39.780> me<00:03:39.810> at<00:03:40.109> the<00:03:40.200> end

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
and by doing so it allows me at the end

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:41.629 
and by doing so it allows me at the end
of<00:03:40.380> that<00:03:40.500> sitting<00:03:40.799> to<00:03:40.950> actually<00:03:41.250> take<00:03:41.430> action

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:41.639 
of that sitting to actually take action

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:43.280 
of that sitting to actually take action
and<00:03:41.940> that's<00:03:42.359> what<00:03:42.480> you<00:03:42.600> ultimately<00:03:42.780> want<00:03:43.230> to

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
and that's what you ultimately want to

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.319 
and that's what you ultimately want to
do<00:03:43.440> now<00:03:43.920> tomorrow<00:03:44.400> I'm<00:03:44.639> going<00:03:44.790> to<00:03:44.880> share<00:03:45.120> with

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
do now tomorrow I'm going to share with

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:48.050 
do now tomorrow I'm going to share with
you<00:03:45.600> a<00:03:45.840> note-taking<00:03:46.709> process<00:03:46.920> that<00:03:47.850> will

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
you a note-taking process that will

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.390 
you a note-taking process that will
literally<00:03:48.329> blow<00:03:48.810> your<00:03:49.079> mind<00:03:49.260> and<00:03:49.500> change<00:03:50.160> the

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
literally blow your mind and change the

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.309 
literally blow your mind and change the
way<00:03:50.519> you<00:03:50.579> work<00:03:50.910> from<00:03:51.510> this<00:03:51.630> point<00:03:51.870> forward<00:03:52.109> I

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
straightforward way that will improve

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.729 
straightforward way that will improve

everything that you do consistently and

00:03:58.739 --> 00:03:59.660 
everything that you do consistently and
you<00:03:59.069> can<00:03:59.190> bank<00:03:59.370> on<00:03:59.459> that

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
you can bank on that

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.120 
you can bank on that
so<00:04:00.090> to<00:04:00.480> higher<00:04:00.660> profits<00:04:01.109> and<00:04:01.230> beyond<00:04:01.440> sheffrin
