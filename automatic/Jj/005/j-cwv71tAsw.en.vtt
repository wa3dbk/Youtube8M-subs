00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
original not that it's a imitation I

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.660 
original not that it's a imitation I
mean<00:03:49.630> it<00:03:49.750> is<00:03:49.900> but<00:03:50.110> it's<00:03:50.410> not<00:03:50.500> a<00:03:50.620> replacement<00:03:51.250> I

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
should say it's it's a different

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.520 
should say it's it's a different
aesthetic<00:03:54.540> and<00:03:55.540> I<00:03:55.690> think<00:03:55.930> it<00:03:56.050> has<00:03:56.230> its<00:03:56.260> own

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
aesthetic and I think it has its own

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.600 
aesthetic and I think it has its own
merits<00:03:56.980> about<00:03:57.520> it<00:03:57.700> and<00:03:59.340> yeah

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
merits about it and yeah

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.420 
merits about it and yeah
