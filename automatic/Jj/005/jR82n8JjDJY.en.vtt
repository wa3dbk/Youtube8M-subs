some of the bells and whistles that they

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.330 
some of the bells and whistles that they
provided<00:00:45.720> us<00:00:45.930> especially<00:00:46.440> for<00:00:46.649> intermodal<00:00:47.100> is

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
provided us especially for intermodal is

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.799 
provided us especially for intermodal is
we<00:00:47.520> have<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:47.730> suspension<00:00:48.180> raise<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.780> lower

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
we have a suspension raise and lower

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.709 
we have a suspension raise and lower
oftentimes<00:00:49.880> landing<00:00:50.880> gear<00:00:51.000> on<00:00:51.030> chasings<00:00:51.570> can

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
oftentimes landing gear on chasings can

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.389 
oftentimes landing gear on chasings can
be<00:00:51.809> kind<00:00:51.989> of<00:00:52.020> an<00:00:52.140> issue<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.559> so<00:00:53.100> we<00:00:53.219> have<00:00:53.309> the

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
be kind of an issue and so we have the

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.770 
be kind of an issue and so we have the
ability<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.700> raise<00:00:54.000> or<00:00:54.239> lower<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.540> suspension

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
ability to raise or lower the suspension

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.690 
ability to raise or lower the suspension
accordingly<00:00:55.559> so<00:00:55.770> that<00:00:55.890> we<00:00:55.980> can<00:00:56.100> safely<00:00:56.309> couple

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:56.700 
accordingly so that we can safely couple

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.280 
accordingly so that we can safely couple
to<00:00:56.790> the<00:00:56.880> equipment<00:00:57.090> we<00:00:57.480> also<00:00:57.630> have<00:00:57.809> an<00:00:57.899> in-cab
