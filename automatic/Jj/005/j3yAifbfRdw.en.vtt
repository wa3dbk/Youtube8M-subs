mean so the back of the shoes so you can
see<00:05:57.259> right<00:05:57.380> there<00:05:58.120> the<00:05:59.120> 2000<00:05:59.719> version<00:05:59.750> have

00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:00.199 
see right there the 2000 version have

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:03.760 
see right there the 2000 version have

one<00:06:07.909> thing<00:06:08.060> that<00:06:08.210> I<00:06:08.270> noticed<00:06:08.659> also<00:06:08.840> is<00:06:09.169> if<00:06:09.409> you

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:09.590 
one thing that I noticed also is if you

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:12.790 
one thing that I noticed also is if you
look<00:06:09.770> at<00:06:09.889> the<00:06:09.979> 2010<00:06:10.669> infrareds<00:06:11.560> look<00:06:12.560> at<00:06:12.680> that

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:12.800 
look at the 2010 infrareds look at that

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.920 
look at the 2010 infrareds look at that
bubble<00:06:12.979> it's<00:06:13.310> a<00:06:13.400> little<00:06:13.639> bit<00:06:13.789> more<00:06:14.000> smaller

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:14.930 
bubble it's a little bit more smaller

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.440 
bubble it's a little bit more smaller
and<00:06:15.370> less<00:06:16.370> I<00:06:16.969> don't

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:17.450 
and less I don't

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:20.140 
and less I don't
it's<00:06:18.080> just<00:06:18.370> jealous<00:06:19.370> looks<00:06:19.640> weird<00:06:19.910> to<00:06:20.000> me

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:20.150 
it's just jealous looks weird to me

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:22.600 
it's just jealous looks weird to me
while<00:06:20.750> the<00:06:20.960> 2000<00:06:21.590> infrareds<00:06:22.010> actually<00:06:22.430> have<00:06:22.580> a

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:22.610 
while the 2000 infrareds actually have a

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:25.030 
while the 2000 infrareds actually have a
more<00:06:22.880> thicker<00:06:23.240> fuller<00:06:24.170> looking<00:06:24.620> bubble<00:06:24.980> on

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:25.040 
more thicker fuller looking bubble on

more thicker fuller looking bubble on
both<00:06:25.250> sides<00:06:25.930> in<00:06:26.930> the<00:06:27.020> 2010<00:06:27.650> versions

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:28.720 
both sides in the 2010 versions

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.620 
both sides in the 2010 versions
you<00:06:29.720> know<00:06:29.840> just<00:06:30.080> it's<00:06:30.680> the<00:06:30.770> same<00:06:30.980> thing<00:06:31.190> on<00:06:31.340> the

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:31.630 
you know just it's the same thing on the

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:34.750 
you know just it's the same thing on the
the<00:06:32.630> white<00:06:32.840> pair<00:06:33.110> the<00:06:33.950> bubbles<00:06:34.340> are<00:06:34.490> just<00:06:34.610> a

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:34.760 
the white pair the bubbles are just a

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:35.590 
the white pair the bubbles are just a
lot<00:06:34.910> smaller

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:35.600 
lot smaller

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.170 
lot smaller
for<00:06:35.720> some<00:06:35.900> reason<00:06:36.200> than<00:06:37.160> anything<00:06:37.610> let's<00:06:38.120> say

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:38.180 
for some reason than anything let's say

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:42.880 
for some reason than anything let's say
compared<00:06:38.600> to<00:06:38.690> the<00:06:38.780> car<00:06:38.990> mines<00:06:40.390> but<00:06:41.390> uh<00:06:41.890> anyway

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:42.890 
compared to the car mines but uh anyway

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:45.460 
compared to the car mines but uh anyway
another<00:06:43.460> difference<00:06:43.910> is<00:06:44.180> the<00:06:44.570> bottom<00:06:45.320> of<00:06:45.410> the

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:45.470 
another difference is the bottom of the

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:48.070 
another difference is the bottom of the
shoes<00:06:45.740> if<00:06:46.040> you<00:06:46.190> take<00:06:46.370> a<00:06:46.400> look<00:06:46.610> on<00:06:46.820> the<00:06:46.910> left<00:06:47.870> is

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:48.080 
shoes if you take a look on the left is

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.280 
shoes if you take a look on the left is
the<00:06:48.230> 2004<00:06:49.040> it's<00:06:49.190> they<00:06:49.460> have<00:06:49.610> a<00:06:50.050> it's<00:06:51.050> like<00:06:51.170> a

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:51.290 
the 2004 it's they have a it's like a

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:55.300 
the 2004 it's they have a it's like a
watery<00:06:51.980> looking<00:06:52.250> very<00:06:52.970> very<00:06:53.270> clear<00:06:54.310> icy

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:55.310 
watery looking very very clear icy

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:57.550 
watery looking very very clear icy
bottom<00:06:55.670> while<00:06:56.090> the<00:06:56.120> 2010's<00:06:57.050> have<00:06:57.170> a<00:06:57.200> more

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:57.560 
bottom while the 2010's have a more

bottom while the 2010's have a more
foggy<00:06:58.550> looking<00:06:59.060> obviously<00:06:59.870> it's<00:07:00.320> a<00:07:00.350> lot

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:00.470 
foggy looking obviously it's a lot

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:03.160 
foggy looking obviously it's a lot
easier<00:07:00.650> because<00:07:01.040> they're<00:07:01.370> brand<00:07:01.670> new<00:07:02.170> while

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:03.170 
easier because they're brand new while

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:06.250 
easier because they're brand new while
these<00:07:03.320> are<00:07:03.470> also<00:07:03.710> brand<00:07:03.980> new<00:07:04.100> but<00:07:04.400> you<00:07:04.640> know<00:07:05.260> 10

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:06.260 
these are also brand new but you know 10

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:10.440 
these are also brand new but you know 10
years<00:07:06.290> age<00:07:06.740> just<00:07:07.250> makes<00:07:07.490> them<00:07:07.610> yellow
