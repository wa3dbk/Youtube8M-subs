00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:11.269
 good good we will learn to make a 

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:14.510
 bow tie a neck bow tie 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:17.360
 there's the bow tie that's not me 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:20.720
 and the bow tie comes to be more or less 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:24.470
 is with the paper that we want 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:27.619
 a very elegant bow tie for any 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.130
 Celebrating how a bow tie is made 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.720
 cork 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:34.410
 Well, we take a square 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.410
 we fold the diagonals 

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:44.420
 to search the center 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:47.750
 and once we have the center then 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:52.810
 We carry two corners 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.810
 to that center one over here 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.659
 and the opposite corner like this would be 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.490
 too thick to be a bow tie 

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:04.720
 we close again 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:07.000
 to narrow 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.960
 finish 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.460
 this in any celebration 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:18.479
 the new year's day the day of our 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:21.990
 good wedding we are already having more or less 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:25.150
 the way bow ties have the 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.060
 sides more or less flat 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.320
 we come to these corners of the center and 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.110
 Now comes the only step that is a 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.690
 bit complicated 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.000
 and enter this line as if we wanted 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:40.610
 take out a square 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.869
 we doubled here 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.869
 we double here 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:53.690
 we turn around 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:56.650
 and we make our kind of triangular 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:59.620
 what is done is usually done 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:02.550
 to make an airplane 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.550
 and once we have it 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.050
 we talk about it between years 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.970
 on the other side exactly the same 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.930
 because the good thing about a bow tie 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:20.470
 neck is that one side is equal to the other 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:24.080
 we doubled here we closed for asia 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:29.380
 we formed that triangle 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.380
 of plane that we said before and here 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.530
 voilÃ  

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.610
 close 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:39.250
 very well 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:41.860
 on this side where the corners are 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.010
 and in this other what we have to do 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.010
 is 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.900
 bouquets 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.680
 towards the center one side 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:55.489
 we closed towards the center 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.489
 the other 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.390
 and when this is very well marked 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.740
 we have what we usually do 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:10.140
 when someone gets the knot of the 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.140
 bow tie stretches a little bit 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:18.910
 on this side here good good this goes 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.080
 to stay 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:24.470
 spectacular 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:28.040
 and from this side to here the only thing 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:31.610
 we need now is 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:36.040
 a neck and he managed that a neck 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:36.040
 anyone has this is the bow tie
