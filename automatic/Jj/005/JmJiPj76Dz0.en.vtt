my<00:00:41.150> wheels<00:00:41.540> a<00:00:42.050> spinnin<00:00:42.530> I<00:00:42.739> got<00:00:43.190> a<00:00:43.220> say<00:00:43.489> so<00:00:44.000> the

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
my wheels a spinnin I got a say so the

first thing we did was we went and dug

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:49.180 
first thing we did was we went and dug
through<00:00:46.910> this<00:00:47.540> huge<00:00:47.930> box<00:00:48.170> of<00:00:48.410> paint<00:00:48.680> chips<00:00:48.949> and

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
through this huge box of paint chips and

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.420 
through this huge box of paint chips and
I<00:00:49.699> have<00:00:49.850> to<00:00:50.030> say<00:00:50.239> I<00:00:50.650> kind<00:00:51.650> of<00:00:51.710> like<00:00:51.800> broke<00:00:52.160> into

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
I have to say I kind of like broke into

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.150 
I have to say I kind of like broke into
a<00:00:52.460> cold<00:00:52.760> sweat<00:00:52.850> because<00:00:53.750> I<00:00:53.780> had<00:00:54.079> this<00:00:54.290> idea<00:00:54.530> of

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
a cold sweat because I had this idea of

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.100 
a cold sweat because I had this idea of
the<00:00:55.400> color<00:00:55.640> palette<00:00:55.940> I<00:00:56.210> wanted<00:00:56.480> to<00:00:56.600> use<00:00:56.780> and

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110 
the color palette I wanted to use and

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.110 
the color palette I wanted to use and
like<00:00:57.590> literally<00:00:57.920> none<00:00:58.220> of<00:00:58.430> those<00:00:58.550> colors<00:00:58.910> were

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
like literally none of those colors were

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.139 
like literally none of those colors were
in<00:00:59.149> there<00:00:59.420> so<00:01:00.280> they<00:01:01.280> don't<00:01:01.460> call<00:01:01.640> it<00:01:01.670> challenge

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
in there so they don't call it challenge

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:05.280 
in there so they don't call it challenge
for<00:01:02.329> nothin<00:01:03.040> so<00:01:04.040> instead<00:01:04.399> I<00:01:04.699> kind<00:01:04.940> of<00:01:05.030> like

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
for nothin so instead I kind of like

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.690 
for nothin so instead I kind of like
rejiggered<00:01:06.290> my<00:01:06.649> thoughts<00:01:06.890> and<00:01:07.780> locked<00:01:08.780> in<00:01:09.140> to

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
rejiggered my thoughts and locked in to

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.190 
rejiggered my thoughts and locked in to
kind<00:01:10.700> of<00:01:10.910> on<00:01:11.180> an<00:01:12.110> ocean<00:01:13.119> sea<00:01:14.119> glass

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
kind of on an ocean sea glass

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.560 
kind of on an ocean sea glass
driftwood<00:01:15.940> weathered<00:01:16.940> black<00:01:17.950> situation<00:01:18.950> and

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
driftwood weathered black situation and

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:26.040 
driftwood weathered black situation and
I<00:01:20.570> snagged<00:01:21.220> this<00:01:22.479> hexagon<00:01:23.479> punch<00:01:24.200> which<00:01:25.100> I

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.050 
I snagged this hexagon punch which I

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.160 
I snagged this hexagon punch which I
mean<00:01:27.050> that's<00:01:27.200> just<00:01:27.410> fun<00:01:28.569> punch<00:01:29.569> some<00:01:29.750> hexagons

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
mean that's just fun punch some hexagons

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.460 
mean that's just fun punch some hexagons
so<00:01:30.890> I<00:01:31.190> have<00:01:31.550> 30<00:01:31.880> minutes<00:01:32.119> to<00:01:32.390> do<00:01:32.539> this<00:01:32.720> we're

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
so I have 30 minutes to do this we're

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.010 
so I have 30 minutes to do this we're
going<00:01:33.560> to<00:01:33.649> set<00:01:33.979> the<00:01:34.130> timer<00:01:34.429> and<00:01:34.819> I'm<00:01:35.479> going<00:01:35.959> to

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
going to set the timer and I'm going to

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.249 
going to set the timer and I'm going to
make<00:01:36.289> a<00:01:37.420> hexagonal<00:01:38.530> paint<00:01:39.530> chip<00:01:39.920> piece<00:01:40.880> of<00:01:41.030> art

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
make a hexagonal paint chip piece of art

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:44.410 
make a hexagonal paint chip piece of art
fit<00:01:42.259> for<00:01:42.440> any<00:01:42.590> wall<00:01:42.830> so<00:01:43.610> let's<00:01:43.819> start<00:01:44.179> the

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
fit for any wall so let's start the

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.800 
fit for any wall so let's start the
timer<00:01:44.660> now<00:01:45.789> so<00:01:46.789> these<00:01:47.179> paint<00:01:47.420> chips<00:01:47.479> are

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
timer now so these paint chips are

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.309 
timer now so these paint chips are
pretty<00:01:48.080> big<00:01:48.349> and<00:01:48.679> I<00:01:49.670> think<00:01:50.060> I<00:01:50.179> can<00:01:50.450> get<00:01:50.720> two

00:01:51.309 --> 00:01:51.319 
pretty big and I think I can get two

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:57.370 
pretty big and I think I can get two
hexagons<00:01:52.209> out<00:01:53.209> of<00:01:53.539> every<00:01:53.959> chip<00:01:54.950> because<00:01:56.380> waste

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
hexagons out of every chip because waste

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.059 
hexagons out of every chip because waste
not<00:01:57.590> want<00:01:57.649> not

00:01:58.059 --> 00:01:58.069 
not want not

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:59.650 
not want not
I'm<00:01:58.310> going<00:01:58.490> to<00:01:58.550> use<00:01:58.640> glue<00:01:58.819> dots<00:01:58.910> to<00:01:59.240> glue<00:01:59.539> these

00:01:59.650 --> 00:01:59.660 
I'm going to use glue dots to glue these

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.770 
I'm going to use glue dots to glue these
down<00:02:00.429> cuz<00:02:01.429> I<00:02:01.700> think<00:02:01.880> by<00:02:01.970> the<00:02:02.030> time<00:02:02.330> I<00:02:02.360> cut<00:02:02.660> all

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
down cuz I think by the time I cut all

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.570 
down cuz I think by the time I cut all
of<00:02:02.810> these<00:02:03.020> out<00:02:03.229> I'm<00:02:03.470> not<00:02:03.679> going<00:02:03.920> to<00:02:04.039> have<00:02:04.160> a<00:02:04.190> lot

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
of these out I'm not going to have a lot

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.900 
of these out I'm not going to have a lot
of<00:02:04.610> time<00:02:05.470> to<00:02:06.470> like<00:02:06.619> wait<00:02:06.830> for<00:02:07.069> glue<00:02:07.250> to<00:02:07.399> dry<00:02:07.550> I'm

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
of time to like wait for glue to dry I'm

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.630 
of time to like wait for glue to dry I'm
good<00:02:08.179> I<00:02:08.360> have<00:02:08.479> 22<00:02:08.959> minutes<00:02:09.110> left<00:02:09.619> so<00:02:10.250> this<00:02:10.459> is

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
good I have 22 minutes left so this is

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.160 
good I have 22 minutes left so this is
kind<00:02:10.910> of<00:02:11.030> my<00:02:11.660> sea<00:02:11.959> glass<00:02:12.170> color<00:02:14.170> called

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
kind of my sea glass color called

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.410 
kind of my sea glass color called
drizzle<00:02:15.560> for<00:02:15.770> shizzle<00:02:16.130> my<00:02:16.250> drizzle<00:02:16.670> I'm<00:02:17.239> just

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
drizzle for shizzle my drizzle I'm just

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.550 
drizzle for shizzle my drizzle I'm just
going<00:02:17.540> to<00:02:17.599> stop<00:02:17.780> that<00:02:17.959> for<00:02:18.110> now<00:02:18.200> and<00:02:18.349> start

going to stop that for now and start

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.320 
going to stop that for now and start
gluing<00:02:18.680> because<00:02:19.160> I<00:02:19.310> can<00:02:19.459> always<00:02:19.670> cut<00:02:19.849> out<00:02:19.970> more

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
gluing because I can always cut out more

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:21.839 
gluing because I can always cut out more
and

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:21.849 
and

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:25.860

like 70 yeah now I'm going to start

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.679 
like 70 yeah now I'm going to start
gluing<00:02:26.650> and<00:02:26.799> glue<00:02:27.340> dots<00:02:27.519> are<00:02:27.760> just<00:02:28.000> so<00:02:28.209> handy

00:02:28.679 --> 00:02:28.689 
gluing and glue dots are just so handy

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:30.839 
gluing and glue dots are just so handy
because<00:02:29.400> you<00:02:30.400> don't<00:02:30.519> have<00:02:30.579> to<00:02:30.670> wait<00:02:30.790> for
