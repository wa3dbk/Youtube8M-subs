a<00:01:18.930> big<00:01:19.110> deal<00:01:20.420> but<00:01:21.420> I<00:01:21.780> tried<00:01:22.440> a<00:01:22.560> few<00:01:22.740> different

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
a big deal but I tried a few different

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.580 
a big deal but I tried a few different
things<00:01:23.100> at<00:01:23.490> first<00:01:23.869> first<00:01:24.869> thing<00:01:25.080> they<00:01:25.200> tried

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
things at first first thing they tried

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:32.919 
things at first first thing they tried
really<00:01:26.149> was<00:01:29.090> to<00:01:30.090> take<00:01:30.539> this<00:01:30.720> tiny<00:01:31.229> pry<00:01:31.560> bar<00:01:31.830> and

00:01:32.919 --> 00:01:32.929 
really was to take this tiny pry bar and

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:36.109 
really was to take this tiny pry bar and
pry<00:01:33.929> this<00:01:33.990> part<00:01:34.380> up<00:01:34.530> with<00:01:35.250> this<00:01:35.550> part<00:01:35.819> staying

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
pry this part up with this part staying

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.070 
pry this part up with this part staying
down<00:01:36.420> so<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.409> basically<00:01:37.679> just<00:01:37.950> tried<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:38.399> bend

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
down so I basically just tried to bend

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.180 
down so I basically just tried to bend
this<00:01:40.080> one<00:01:41.069> little<00:01:41.580> piece<00:01:41.940> right<00:01:42.119> here<00:01:43.190> there

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
this one little piece right here there

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.039 
this one little piece right here there
and<00:01:44.520> that<00:01:45.270> actually<00:01:45.569> works<00:01:45.750> pretty<00:01:45.840> well

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
and that actually works pretty well

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.969 
and that actually works pretty well
except<00:01:46.799> for<00:01:46.830> we<00:01:47.100> can<00:01:47.250> see<00:01:47.580> on<00:01:48.200> amazing<00:01:49.200> this

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
except for we can see on amazing this

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.249 
except for we can see on amazing this
scrape<00:01:50.549> right<00:01:50.580> here<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.690> magazine<00:01:52.080> catch

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
scrape right here the magazine catch

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.109 
scrape right here the magazine catch
actually<00:01:52.679> went<00:01:52.860> in<00:01:52.950> too<00:01:53.130> far<00:01:53.459> when<00:01:53.670> I<00:01:53.700> did<00:01:53.940> that

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
actually went in too far when I did that

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.149 
actually went in too far when I did that
so<00:01:54.899> I<00:01:55.560> was<00:01:56.009> scraping<00:01:56.670> up<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.149> down<00:01:57.299> on<00:01:57.509> it<00:01:58.159> but

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
so I was scraping up and down on it but

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.730 
so I was scraping up and down on it but
it<00:01:59.340> worked<00:01:59.689> but<00:02:00.689> I<00:02:00.899> didn't<00:02:01.229> actually<00:02:01.409> like

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
it worked but I didn't actually like

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:02.719 
it worked but I didn't actually like
that<00:02:01.920> I<00:02:01.979> wanted<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.280> fix<00:02:02.460> it

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
that I wanted to fix it

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.149 
that I wanted to fix it
see<00:02:02.880> if<00:02:02.939> I<00:02:03.000> do<00:02:03.060> a<00:02:03.180> little<00:02:03.299> bit<00:02:03.479> better<00:02:03.630> so<00:02:04.289> I

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
see if I do a little bit better so I

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.810 
see if I do a little bit better so I
actually<00:02:05.880> bent<00:02:06.390> it<00:02:06.539> back<00:02:06.570> a<00:02:06.750> little<00:02:06.899> bit<00:02:07.820> bent

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820 
actually bent it back a little bit bent

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.090 
actually bent it back a little bit bent
it<00:02:08.940> back<00:02:08.970> a<00:02:09.090> little<00:02:09.179> more<00:02:09.479> flush<00:02:09.810> just<00:02:10.200> this

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
it back a little more flush just this

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.960 
it back a little more flush just this
part<00:02:11.400> right<00:02:11.549> here<00:02:12.500> a<00:02:13.500> little<00:02:14.190> more<00:02:14.400> flush<00:02:14.700> and

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
part right here a little more flush and

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.960 
part right here a little more flush and
then<00:02:15.359> I<00:02:15.690> pried<00:02:16.079> it<00:02:16.200> open<00:02:16.260> again<00:02:16.500> and<00:02:17.010> just<00:02:17.730> kind

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
then I pried it open again and just kind

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.099 
then I pried it open again and just kind
of<00:02:18.170> twist<00:02:19.170> it<00:02:19.350> a<00:02:19.410> little<00:02:19.590> bit<00:02:20.390> like<00:02:21.390> that<00:02:21.420> and

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:22.109 
of twist it a little bit like that and

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:26.960 
of twist it a little bit like that and
held<00:02:22.560> it<00:02:23.180> and<00:02:24.620> that's<00:02:25.620> really<00:02:26.040> all<00:02:26.310> it<00:02:26.340> took<00:02:26.640> I

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
held it and that's really all it took I

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.910 
held it and that's really all it took I
didn't<00:02:27.870> actually<00:02:28.440> cut<00:02:28.890> this<00:02:29.100> piece<00:02:29.310> off<00:02:30.920> it

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
didn't actually cut this piece off it

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.150 
didn't actually cut this piece off it
still<00:02:32.250> overlaps<00:02:32.790> I'd<00:02:33.950> especially<00:02:34.950> when<00:02:35.070> the

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
still overlaps I'd especially when the

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.670 
still overlaps I'd especially when the
Safety's<00:02:35.519> down<00:02:35.700> or<00:02:36.359> when<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.230> Safety's<00:02:37.530> off

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
Safety's down or when the Safety's off

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.400 
Safety's down or when the Safety's off
it<00:02:37.890> still<00:02:38.040> overlaps<00:02:38.489> but<00:02:38.730> you<00:02:38.820> can<00:02:38.970> still

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
it still overlaps but you can still

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.250 
it still overlaps but you can still
press<00:02:40.410> that<00:02:40.620> magazine<00:02:40.980> press<00:02:41.250> and<00:02:41.630> I<00:02:42.630> did<00:02:43.079> not

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
press that magazine press and I did not

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.930 
press that magazine press and I did not
cut<00:02:43.620> this<00:02:44.579> piece<00:02:44.820> either<00:02:46.609> so<00:02:47.609> let's<00:02:47.760> go<00:02:47.880> ahead

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
cut this piece either so let's go ahead

00:02:47.940 --> 00:03:03.860 
cut this piece either so let's go ahead
and<00:02:48.329> put<00:02:48.870> it<00:02:48.959> back<00:02:49.049> together
