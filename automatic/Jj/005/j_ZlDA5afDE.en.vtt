 The Minister of Transport Carlos Arias 

00:00:02.949 --> 00:00:06.520
 has made important progress in the 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.130
 subway network to file meet 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:11.080
 approximately 4.2 million trips 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:12.849
 newspapers on public transport in the 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.469
 city and who was with a view 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:16.450
 privileged of what is happening 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:19.010
 in this section 2 is castle lourdes 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:22.730
 where are you lourdes 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:24.710
 how are you I'm claudio 40 meters 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.200
 I can not believe the truth 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:30.619
 but as they said we are with a 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:33.410
 privileged view and that too soon 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:37.160
 will have many citizens who will enjoy 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:39.530
 of this section 2 of line 1 of the subway 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.660
 from Lima that goes from Grau Avenue 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.210
 until san juan de lurigancho we are going to 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.820
 talk with the executive director of 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.590
 the autonomous authority of the electric train 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:52.129
 when I'm driving who's going to give us 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:55.010
 more details about this work that goes 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:58.670
 to be ready before the thought 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:01.699
 good morning good morning lourdes this 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:06.350
 hour was originally scheduled to 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:11.280
 the month was initially scheduled to 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:15.119
 conclude next year in September 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.820
 we are on a very fast schedule 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.070
 and we will conclude in April next 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.409
 year 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:25.190
 the progress of the work is currently in 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:29.840
 78% 92 percent of civil works 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:33.400
 is finished and we are in 44 by 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:36.290
 hundred of the electromechanical works 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:39.619
 we are at this moment on the bridge 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.659
 on the rímac river a bridge of 240 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.899
 meters long 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:47.469
 that is being built with a system 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:50.840
 that for the first time is tested in Peru 

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:54.930
 is a system based on two candles that 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:58.710
 they work on site 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:01.410
 with a mobile structure that allows 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.770
 go riding them in sections of 5 in 5 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.770
 meters 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.640
 to move 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.670
 will make more than 4 million 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.130
 daily trips 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.569
 and that sounds but 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.159
 a strong world 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.870
 the congestion we sometimes meet 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:21.889
 here in the city this will alleviate 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:25.620
 quite this topic is the potential is 

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:29.519
 this section 2 of line 1 of the metro 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.550
 drive via del salvador with san juan de 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:34.280
 lurigancho 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:37.110
 the stretch between the square aggravated 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:40.200
 currently the subway works 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.810
 from villa el salvador to the plaza 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.330
 grau this section 2 that we are in this 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.500
 moment observing begins in square 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.650
 degree and finish in san juan de 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.650
 lurigancho 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.720
 As I said, it will be finished in April 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.940
 next year and will allow to join 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.020
 these two big districts san juan de 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.900
 lurigancho the district with the highest 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.860
 population in the city of Lima with him and 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.330
 the Savior 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:09.120
 joining north and south of the tad more with 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:12.330
 one in a travel time of 50 minutes 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:16.200
 the total investment amount the amount of 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:21.330
 investment is 900 million dollars 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:23.519
 that at this moment we are going to 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.950
 allow to have this great work of great 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:28.890
 magnitude and of great importance for the 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.120
 city the magnet besides that they will be 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.510
 citizens with a view 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.360
 privileged are going to see the city from 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.550
 above 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.370
 another way to travel another perspective 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:43.190
 at the time of moving costs the 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:46.220
 work to the study center maybe a 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:48.590
 Sunday with the family will change 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.870
 somehow the mood of the people 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.770
 let's say you are not going to find 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:56.210
 some congestion with some knot 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:59.650
 effectively indeed it is also a 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:03.220
 non-polluting means of transport 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.299
 by allowing the amount is populated 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.819
 of population to which we have been 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:10.599
 alluding to be able to move from this 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:12.489
 way we are allowing that without 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:14.470
 pollution with protection 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:16.139
 appropriate from the environment those 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.609
 people move move 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:21.459
 comfortably to your work center 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:25.570
 have a greater possibility of dedicating 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:27.550
 time to family and in this way go 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.090
 creating a kind of culture not one 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:34.080
 culture that we are looking for 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.080
 affirm as a metro culture 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:40.260
 the cost of the ticket is not yet fixed 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.810
 is what they currently pay currently 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:47.300
 move from villa el salvador 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:47.300
 until the plaza grau costs a sun 50 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:54.820
 the fee is studied by the ministry 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:57.730
 of transport and at the time yes 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:59.230
 outside the case will be adjusted but in 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:04.060
 this moment move from biden 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:07.000
 savior until the plaza grau that are 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:11.110
 It is approximately 32 minutes of travel 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.330
 it costs a single 50 plus it's going to count 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:16.930
 with different stations true and that already 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:19.210
 they are progressing quite well it is true 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.580
 we have for example the angel presbyter 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:24.490
 master water box pyramid are the 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:27.910
 gardens the posts san carlos san 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:29.500
 martín santa rosa- bayóvar we have 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:31.780
 several stations that are already quite 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.550
 advanced actually the work is going 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.900
 pretty good and here we see the 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:37.240
 workers who are from very 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.040
 early also with us makes some 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.330
 minutes were waving us to the 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.670
 camera 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:47.470
 indeed this work will allow 

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:50.710
 give employment to 4000 skilled workers 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:50.710
 who are 

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:56.700
 delivering his contribution 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:59.400
 to the development of this great project 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:03.540
 it's safe is now totally safe 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:07.129
 is designed to withstand an earthquake 

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:09.619
 9 degrees up to 9 degrees 

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:13.729
 Best of all travel time 

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:15.619
 Estimated time 18 minutes 18 minutes 

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:17.599
 of the time it would take to move from 

00:06:15.619 --> 00:06:19.249
 the grau square to the bayóvar station 

00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:21.080
 of the last station in san juan de 

00:06:19.249 --> 00:06:23.330
 lurigancho I do not know if you have 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:25.009
 some consultation in study in reality 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.389
 simply reinforce lourdes is something very 

00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:29.080
 interesting what the 

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:31.159
 representative of the metro of Lima that is 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:33.110
 the connection between san juan de lurigancho 

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:34.759
 and villa el salvador and only 50 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:37.819
 minutes that is is connecting the 

00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:40.360
 north and south of Lima- in just 50 

00:06:37.819 --> 00:06:43.220
 minutes is like that 

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:47.870
 effectively in 50 minutes 

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:50.030
 it's 18 minutes is this new stretch and 

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:54.290
 currently move from vi the 

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:56.630
 savior until the plaza grau takes 32 

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:59.060
 minutes 

00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:02.870
 40 meters above the ground but to your 

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:04.700
 back there is a much bigger crane 

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:07.160
 and you realize that we are 

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:11.650
 shaking the wind do not go to 

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:14.050
 Carlos Torres we are not very well 

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:15.880
 with harnesses put on our field 

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:17.720
 because if you can not be here in 

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:20.510
 this work 

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:22.490
 they are safety things that are demanded and 

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:24.530
 that it is very good to be this way 

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:28.070
 is part of good practices in the 

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:30.380
 construction is good simply we 

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:32.360
 we were amazed by the view that we 

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:34.159
 are you getting there 

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:36.590
 to screens not true this view 

00:07:34.159 --> 00:07:38.659
 privileged section 2 of the metro 

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:40.520
 lima the advances are already quite 

00:07:38.659 --> 00:07:42.770
 important with this are going to be done 

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:45.439
 approximately 4 million trips 

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:46.580
 newspapers on public transport in our 

00:07:45.439 --> 00:07:48.319

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:55.219
 nationals here foreign and good what 

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:56.599
 important is that in Peru it is 

00:07:55.219 --> 00:07:59.169
 doing engineering and engineering 

00:07:56.599 --> 00:07:59.169
