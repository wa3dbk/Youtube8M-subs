can<00:00:22.230> find<00:00:22.470> that<00:00:22.590> online<00:00:22.769> it's<00:00:23.369> a<00:00:23.550> 10<00:00:23.760> by<00:00:23.910> 8<00:00:24.150> this

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
can find that online it's a 10 by 8 this

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.420 
can find that online it's a 10 by 8 this
is<00:00:24.810> more<00:00:25.140> of<00:00:25.199> a<00:00:25.289> research<00:00:25.619> project<00:00:25.890> for

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
is more of a research project for

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.880 
is more of a research project for
aquaponics<00:00:26.840> so<00:00:27.840> we<00:00:28.289> wanted<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.560> keep<00:00:28.710> it

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
aquaponics so we wanted to keep it

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.120 
aquaponics so we wanted to keep it
scalable<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:29.910> small<00:00:30.300> size<00:00:30.740> let's<00:00:31.740> go<00:00:31.859> inside

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
scalable and small size let's go inside

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.459 
scalable and small size let's go inside
and<00:00:32.309> look<00:00:32.369> at<00:00:32.660> so<00:00:33.660> now<00:00:34.020> that<00:00:34.200> we're<00:00:34.320> inside

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
and look at so now that we're inside

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.639 
and look at so now that we're inside
I'll<00:00:35.070> show<00:00:35.250> you<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.460> aquaponic<00:00:36.000> system<00:00:36.649> our

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
I'll show you the aquaponic system our

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.310 
I'll show you the aquaponic system our
our<00:00:38.520> original<00:00:38.910> plan<00:00:39.120> is<00:00:39.360> that<00:00:39.390> we<00:00:39.570> have<00:00:39.780> 36

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
our original plan is that we have 36

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.869 
our original plan is that we have 36
towers<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:40.920> we<00:00:41.070> narrowed<00:00:41.219> it<00:00:41.370> down<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.550> nine

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
towers and we narrowed it down to nine

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.529 
towers and we narrowed it down to nine
and<00:00:42.570> then<00:00:42.690> down<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:43.020> six<00:00:43.320> I<00:00:44.120> removed<00:00:45.120> this<00:00:45.300> one

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
and then down to six I removed this one

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.330 
and then down to six I removed this one
just<00:00:45.809> now<00:00:46.020> so<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:46.440> could<00:00:46.620> get<00:00:46.770> a<00:00:46.829> better<00:00:46.980> view

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
just now so you could get a better view

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.549 
just now so you could get a better view
of<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.489> inside<00:00:47.910> so<00:00:48.840> as<00:00:49.079> most<00:00:49.230> of<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:49.530> know

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
of the inside so as most of you know

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.500 
of the inside so as most of you know
what<00:00:49.860> aquaponics<00:00:50.129> already<00:00:50.760> is<00:00:50.940> we<00:00:51.180> have<00:00:51.329> our

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
what aquaponics already is we have our

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.600 
what aquaponics already is we have our
fish<00:00:51.750> in<00:00:51.899> our<00:00:51.989> fish<00:00:52.199> tank<00:00:52.410> we<00:00:53.190> have<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.399> water

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
fish in our fish tank we have the water

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.729 
fish in our fish tank we have the water
pump<00:00:53.910> which<00:00:54.120> is<00:00:54.239> pumping<00:00:54.660> water<00:00:54.870> up<00:00:55.110> this<00:00:55.379> 1/2

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
pump which is pumping water up this 1/2

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.330 
pump which is pumping water up this 1/2
inch<00:00:56.100> of<00:00:56.399> black<00:00:57.120> piping<00:00:57.660> then<00:00:58.410> we<00:00:58.500> have<00:00:58.680> 3

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
inch of black piping then we have 3

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.599 
inch of black piping then we have 3
nozzles<00:00:59.969> in<00:01:00.899> here<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.440> they<00:01:01.980> drip<00:01:02.250> into<00:01:02.399> our

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
nozzles in here and they drip into our

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.160 
nozzles in here and they drip into our
towers<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.210> if<00:01:03.270> you<00:01:03.359> watch<00:01:03.570> our<00:01:03.840> earlier

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
towers and if you watch our earlier

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.320 
towers and if you watch our earlier
videos<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:04.769> can<00:01:04.920> find<00:01:05.610> out<00:01:05.760> how<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:05.909> make<00:01:06.180> the

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
videos you can find out how to make the

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.350 
videos you can find out how to make the
towers<00:01:06.720> for<00:01:07.020> your<00:01:07.110> system<00:01:07.939> basically<00:01:08.939> what<00:01:09.210> we

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
towers for your system basically what we

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.359 
towers for your system basically what we
have<00:01:09.570> is<00:01:09.750> just<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:10.350> water<00:01:10.560> dripping<00:01:10.890> straight

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
have is just the water dripping straight

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.080 
have is just the water dripping straight
down<00:01:11.640> there's<00:01:11.970> no<00:01:13.070> no<00:01:14.070> spread<00:01:14.400> or<00:01:14.580> anything<00:01:14.970> it

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
down there's no no spread or anything it

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.789 
down there's no no spread or anything it
just<00:01:15.119> goes<00:01:15.420> straight<00:01:15.990> down<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.290> tower<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.710> it

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
just goes straight down the tower and it

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.120 
just goes straight down the tower and it
gets<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.130> roots<00:01:17.340> wet<00:01:18.210> very<00:01:18.659> well<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.590> we<00:01:20.009> have

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
gets the roots wet very well and we have

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.120 
gets the roots wet very well and we have
about<00:01:20.400> seven<00:01:21.180> gallons<00:01:21.570> an<00:01:21.720> hour<00:01:22.130> going

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
about seven gallons an hour going

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.620 
about seven gallons an hour going
through<00:01:23.310> these<00:01:23.640> towers<00:01:24.150> as<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.619> now<00:01:26.390> we<00:01:27.390> have

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
through these towers as a now we have

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.539 
through these towers as a now we have
three<00:01:28.350> or<00:01:28.470> four<00:01:28.710> different<00:01:28.799> types<00:01:29.130> of<00:01:29.340> lettuce

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
three or four different types of lettuce

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.240 
three or four different types of lettuce
we<00:01:30.540> have<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.780> few<00:01:31.140> tomato<00:01:31.470> plants<00:01:31.890> just<00:01:32.070> to

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
we have a few tomato plants just to

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.469 
we have a few tomato plants just to
experiment<00:01:32.909> with<00:01:34.009> and<00:01:35.009> in<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.880> bottom<00:01:36.060> of<00:01:36.329> our

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
experiment with and in the bottom of our

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.649 
experiment with and in the bottom of our
gutter<00:01:36.780> we<00:01:37.200> have<00:01:37.439> hydrogen<00:01:37.950> which<00:01:38.820> most<00:01:39.509> of

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
gutter we have hydrogen which most of

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.780 
gutter we have hydrogen which most of
you<00:01:39.780> have<00:01:39.900> probably<00:01:40.079> heard<00:01:40.290> of<00:01:40.560> or<00:01:40.740> seen<00:01:40.790> it's

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
you have probably heard of or seen it's

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.760 
you have probably heard of or seen it's
just<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.150> rock<00:01:42.360> that<00:01:42.659> allows<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.170> bacteria<00:01:43.350> to

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
just a rock that allows the bacteria to

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.499 
just a rock that allows the bacteria to
really<00:01:44.100> get<00:01:44.310> in<00:01:44.460> there<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:44.880> grow<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.360> make

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
really get in there and grow and make

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.450 
really get in there and grow and make
your<00:01:45.750> ecosystem<00:01:48.740> one<00:01:49.740> of<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:49.890> good<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.280> key

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
your ecosystem one of the good and key

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.399 
your ecosystem one of the good and key
things<00:01:50.729> about<00:01:50.850> our<00:01:51.060> design<00:01:51.360> is<00:01:51.689> that<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.140> can

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
things about our design is that you can

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.190 
things about our design is that you can
unhook<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:53.070> towers

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
unhook the towers

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.819 
unhook the towers
so<00:01:55.200> first<00:01:55.470> we'll<00:01:55.770> plug<00:01:55.979> up<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.250> hole

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:57.829 
so first we'll plug up the hole

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:01.569 
so first we'll plug up the hole
just<00:01:58.829> something<00:01:59.070> it's<00:01:59.189> not<00:01:59.280> dripping<00:01:59.579> it<00:01:59.820> all

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
just something it's not dripping it all

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:07.219 
just something it's not dripping it all
for<00:02:02.579> as<00:02:02.700> little<00:02:02.820> as<00:02:02.969> possible<00:02:05.960> and<00:02:06.960> you<00:02:07.079> can

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
for as little as possible and you can

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.150 
for as little as possible and you can
actually<00:02:07.710> hook<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.580> tower<00:02:09.080> and<00:02:10.080> then<00:02:10.619> take<00:02:11.129> it

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
actually hook the tower and then take it

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.490 
actually hook the tower and then take it
to<00:02:11.370> market<00:02:11.519> so<00:02:12.390> if<00:02:12.540> you<00:02:12.660> want<00:02:12.840> to<00:02:12.870> settle<00:02:13.410> the

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
to market so if you want to settle the

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.580 
to market so if you want to settle the
farmers<00:02:13.860> market<00:02:14.310> or<00:02:14.459> take<00:02:14.760> it<00:02:14.910> indoors<00:02:15.299> or<00:02:15.870> if

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
farmers market or take it indoors or if

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.110 
farmers market or take it indoors or if
you're<00:02:16.769> doing<00:02:17.010> it<00:02:17.099> more<00:02:17.220> commercially<00:02:17.819> and

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
you're doing it more commercially and

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.270 
you're doing it more commercially and
you<00:02:18.900> want<00:02:19.049> to<00:02:19.140> take<00:02:19.530> it<00:02:19.650> to<00:02:19.739> restaurants<00:02:20.190> they

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
you want to take it to restaurants they

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.520 
you want to take it to restaurants they
can<00:02:20.400> actually<00:02:20.580> just<00:02:20.970> cut<00:02:21.599> off<00:02:21.780> what<00:02:22.080> they<00:02:22.230> want

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
can actually just cut off what they want

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.550 
can actually just cut off what they want
what<00:02:22.739> fall<00:02:23.010> under<00:02:23.250> they<00:02:23.370> want<00:02:24.140> pick<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.290> size

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
what fall under they want pick the size

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.400 
what fall under they want pick the size
the<00:02:25.980> weight<00:02:26.190> multiple<00:02:27.030> things<00:02:27.239> so<00:02:28.080> this<00:02:28.230> is<00:02:28.349> a

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
the weight multiple things so this is a

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.910 
the weight multiple things so this is a
good<00:02:28.560> way<00:02:28.739> to<00:02:28.769> just<00:02:29.360> come<00:02:30.360> it<00:02:30.480> movable

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
good way to just come it movable

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.430 
good way to just come it movable
transportable<00:02:32.390> then<00:02:33.390> also<00:02:33.660> if<00:02:34.110> whatever

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
transportable then also if whatever

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.080 
transportable then also if whatever
doesn't<00:02:34.920> sell<00:02:35.160> in<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.489> market<00:02:35.849> or<00:02:35.970> at<00:02:36.030> a

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
doesn't sell in the market or at a

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.120 
doesn't sell in the market or at a
restaurant<00:02:36.450> you<00:02:37.170> can<00:02:37.200> just<00:02:37.560> hook<00:02:37.680> it<00:02:37.829> straight

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
restaurant you can just hook it straight

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.390 
restaurant you can just hook it straight
back<00:02:38.340> on<00:02:38.489> the<00:02:38.640> tower

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
back on the tower

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.940 
back on the tower
make<00:02:41.400> sure<00:02:41.640> there's<00:02:41.849> in<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.150> gutter<00:02:42.920> and<00:02:43.920> then

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
make sure there's in the gutter and then

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:53.330 
make sure there's in the gutter and then
undo<00:02:46.950> your<00:02:47.190> valve<00:02:51.079> and<00:02:52.079> there<00:02:52.230> you<00:02:52.319> go<00:02:52.470> it's

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
undo your valve and there you go it's

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.839 
undo your valve and there you go it's
back<00:02:53.549> to<00:02:53.760> work<00:02:54.769> so<00:02:55.769> we<00:02:55.799> have<00:02:56.040> like<00:02:56.430> I<00:02:56.519> said<00:02:56.700> we

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
back to work so we have like I said we

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:58.670 
back to work so we have like I said we
have<00:02:57.000> four<00:02:57.360> different<00:02:57.480> types<00:02:57.629> of<00:02:57.959> lettuce<00:02:58.200> we

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
have four different types of lettuce we

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.539 
have four different types of lettuce we
have<00:02:59.090> some<00:03:00.090> arugula<00:03:00.859> some<00:03:01.859> kind<00:03:02.100> of<00:03:02.160> a<00:03:02.280> Caesar

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
have some arugula some kind of a Caesar

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:06.229 
have some arugula some kind of a Caesar
lettuce<00:03:03.150> just<00:03:03.470> romaine<00:03:04.470> lettuce<00:03:04.769> and<00:03:05.310> then

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
lettuce just romaine lettuce and then

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.270 
lettuce just romaine lettuce and then
some<00:03:06.450> red<00:03:06.600> lists<00:03:06.900> and<00:03:07.380> they<00:03:07.769> all<00:03:07.889> seem<00:03:08.160> to<00:03:08.190> be

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
some red lists and they all seem to be

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.160 
some red lists and they all seem to be
doing<00:03:08.670> very<00:03:08.700> very<00:03:09.060> well<00:03:09.299> there<00:03:09.690> was<00:03:09.780> only<00:03:09.900> one

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
doing very very well there was only one

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.170 
doing very very well there was only one
type<00:03:10.380> of<00:03:10.530> lettuce<00:03:10.739> it<00:03:11.010> was<00:03:11.130> more<00:03:11.370> of<00:03:11.459> an<00:03:11.579> exotic

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
type of lettuce it was more of an exotic

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.610 
type of lettuce it was more of an exotic
lettuce<00:03:12.600> that<00:03:12.630> didn't<00:03:12.959> do<00:03:13.019> very<00:03:13.049> well<00:03:13.319> at<00:03:13.530> all

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
lettuce that didn't do very well at all

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.250 
lettuce that didn't do very well at all
we<00:03:14.100> saw<00:03:14.250> that<00:03:14.400> basil<00:03:14.639> didn't<00:03:15.569> do<00:03:15.660> very<00:03:15.690> well<00:03:15.989> in

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
we saw that basil didn't do very well in

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.849 
we saw that basil didn't do very well in
our<00:03:16.560> project<00:03:18.079> so<00:03:19.079> we're<00:03:19.230> not<00:03:19.350> sure<00:03:19.590> if<00:03:19.680> that<00:03:19.829> is

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
our project so we're not sure if that is

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:22.340 
our project so we're not sure if that is
because<00:03:20.190> of<00:03:20.220> the<00:03:20.400> chemistry<00:03:20.730> or<00:03:21.660> if<00:03:21.840> the<00:03:21.989> pH<00:03:22.319> is

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
because of the chemistry or if the pH is

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.979 
because of the chemistry or if the pH is
is<00:03:22.799> not<00:03:23.069> perfect<00:03:23.549> enough<00:03:23.730> for<00:03:23.790> basil<00:03:24.389> also

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
is not perfect enough for basil also

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:29.720 
is not perfect enough for basil also
cilantro<00:03:25.799> didn't<00:03:26.099> do<00:03:26.190> very<00:03:26.220> well<00:03:26.489> either

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.710 

so<00:03:30.730> now<00:03:30.849> I'm<00:03:30.909> going<00:03:31.030> to<00:03:31.120> show<00:03:31.239> you<00:03:31.299> the<00:03:31.540> inside

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
so now I'm going to show you the inside

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.550 
so now I'm going to show you the inside
of<00:03:32.170> our<00:03:32.349> solar<00:03:32.980> system<00:03:33.099> and<00:03:33.549> how<00:03:33.700> that<00:03:33.939> works

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
of our solar system and how that works

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.319 
of our solar system and how that works
we<00:03:35.560> have<00:03:35.590> two<00:03:35.890> Trojan<00:03:36.459> batteries<00:03:36.730> that<00:03:37.209> are

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
we have two Trojan batteries that are

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:40.710 
we have two Trojan batteries that are
100<00:03:37.780> amp<00:03:38.019> hour<00:03:38.319> and<00:03:39.299> they're<00:03:40.299> very<00:03:40.450> high

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
100 amp hour and they're very high

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.619 
100 amp hour and they're very high
quality<00:03:40.780> so<00:03:41.640> they're<00:03:42.640> deep<00:03:42.879> cycles<00:03:43.420> they're

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:43.629 
quality so they're deep cycles they're

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:46.020 
quality so they're deep cycles they're
meant<00:03:43.900> to<00:03:43.989> be<00:03:44.079> charged<00:03:44.680> down<00:03:44.920> and<00:03:45.280> then

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
meant to be charged down and then

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.059 
meant to be charged down and then
recharged<00:03:46.720> and<00:03:46.959> they<00:03:47.200> can<00:03:47.379> do<00:03:47.500> that<00:03:47.620> several

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:48.069 
recharged and they can do that several

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:49.890 
recharged and they can do that several
times<00:03:48.129> without<00:03:48.670> being<00:03:48.879> hurt<00:03:49.239> they<00:03:49.540> can<00:03:49.690> do<00:03:49.810> it

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
times without being hurt they can do it

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.649 
times without being hurt they can do it
many<00:03:50.170> many<00:03:50.319> times<00:03:50.459> we<00:03:51.459> have<00:03:51.640> a<00:03:51.909> solar<00:03:52.269> charge

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:52.659 
many many times we have a solar charge

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:55.349 
many many times we have a solar charge
controller<00:03:53.140> that<00:03:54.010> we<00:03:54.340> have<00:03:54.459> hooked<00:03:54.700> up<00:03:54.849> from

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:55.359 
controller that we have hooked up from

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:58.710 
controller that we have hooked up from
our<00:03:55.769> batteries<00:03:56.769> to<00:03:57.250> our<00:03:57.400> load<00:03:57.670> into<00:03:58.239> our<00:03:58.359> solar

our batteries to our load into our solar
panels<00:03:59.079> and<00:03:59.290> then<00:04:00.069> we<00:04:00.280> have<00:04:00.489> an<00:04:00.670> ac/dc<00:04:01.540> AC

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:02.319
