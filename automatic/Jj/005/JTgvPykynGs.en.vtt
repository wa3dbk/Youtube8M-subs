00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:11.590
 The former is a container that can be moved by the assigned polygon surface with 100 faces 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:15.870
 You can move it like this flexibly 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:19.500
 We will look at how to create foma in the situation 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.360
 Create a former by selecting the polyform you want to put in foma 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:26.640
 Press 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:31.660
 At this time, it is also possible to select and create multiple polygons 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:36.650
 Here the name and the insertion destination of the parts and belongs to de forma You can choose the 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:42.910
 And a selection of rotation and the curved surface in this type of deformable 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:49.930
 If you select a surface, you can set the number of divisions of the cash register and the number of divisions of change 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:53.070
 Rectangular Since former, divided editing part longitudinally laterally when, for example, to put the number of divisions 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.070
 will be created 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:05.360
 When the number of divisions of change is increased, the number of divisions of the editing sky lightning increases and the movement following the editing part becomes more 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.360
 It becomes fine 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:22.210
 You can change the number of divisions of this conversion later in the editing palette 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:23.920
 It was the case with polygons, but if the number of divisions of cash register and the number of divisions of return increase unreasonably, the data becomes 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:28.750
 It will be heavy 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:35.200
 As a rule of thumb, set the number of divisions to 3 and the maximum number. 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:40.830
 It is recommended to keep the number of divisions of conversion up to about 6 times 6 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:45.420
 And don't forget to set this selected object as a parent . 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:48.820
 If this is unchecked, the polygon selected for foma is 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:53.890
 It will not be included 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:59.290
 Remove the check to the contrary, when you want to create a form it is not entered anything in if 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:05.400
 It is written also in this part that they will create a former because they receive 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:05.400
 You can transform only a deformer in control + drag 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:12.760
 If you deform the deformer you created without saying to 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:17.920
 I will 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:19.569
 Deforming only the deformable without effect on is the child element by holding down the Control 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:25.859
 Can 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:25.859
 If you want to change the size after creating a form in, please operate in this way
