same time so just want to point some
things<00:00:19.830> out<00:00:20.250> here<00:00:20.580> that<00:00:20.810> both<00:00:21.810> of<00:00:21.869> these

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
things out here that both of these

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.779 
things out here that both of these
devices<00:00:22.380> are<00:00:22.890> coming<00:00:23.220> with<00:00:23.519> Qualcomm

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
devices are coming with Qualcomm

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.370 
devices are coming with Qualcomm
Snapdragon<00:00:24.029> 410<00:00:24.990> chipset<00:00:25.670> and<00:00:26.720> also<00:00:27.720> but<00:00:28.050> this

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
Snapdragon 410 chipset and also but this

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.529 
Snapdragon 410 chipset and also but this
one<00:00:28.590> has<00:00:28.769> two<00:00:29.010> gigabyte<00:00:29.340> of<00:00:29.490> RAM<00:00:29.670> now<00:00:30.210> both

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
one has two gigabyte of RAM now both

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.560 
one has two gigabyte of RAM now both
have<00:00:30.720> 1.5<00:00:31.080> gigabyte<00:00:32.009> of<00:00:32.160> RAM<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.669> a5<00:00:33.149> has<00:00:33.360> to

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
have 1.5 gigabyte of RAM the a5 has to

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.209 
have 1.5 gigabyte of RAM the a5 has to
be<00:00:33.719> better<00:00:33.840> RAM<00:00:34.079> so<00:00:34.320> of<00:00:34.469> course<00:00:34.680> you<00:00:35.010> have<00:00:35.190> a

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
be better RAM so of course you have a

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.380 
be better RAM so of course you have a
lot<00:00:35.399> of<00:00:35.460> phones<00:00:35.760> when<00:00:35.969> you<00:00:36.059> have<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.210> lot<00:00:36.360> of

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
lot of phones when you have a lot of

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.150 
lot of phones when you have a lot of
phones<00:00:36.630> it's<00:00:37.350> you<00:00:37.440> know<00:00:37.530> difficult<00:00:37.950> to

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
phones it's you know difficult to

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.979 
phones it's you know difficult to
remember<00:00:38.969> some<00:00:39.690> things

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
remember some things

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.639 
remember some things
Oh<00:00:40.320> e<00:00:40.710> 5<00:00:41.670> is<00:00:41.820> faster<00:00:42.300> pretty<00:00:42.809> interesting<00:00:43.440> here

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
Oh e 5 is faster pretty interesting here

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.920 
Oh e 5 is faster pretty interesting here
because<00:00:44.180> we<00:00:45.180> got<00:00:45.329> some<00:00:45.539> different<00:00:45.870> results

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
because we got some different results

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.130 
because we got some different results
with<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.590> g5<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.219> a5<00:00:47.370> if<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:48.360> are

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
with the g5 and the a5 if you are

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.959 
with the g5 and the a5 if you are
interested<00:00:49.739> you<00:00:49.860> can<00:00:49.980> check<00:00:50.039> that<00:00:50.190> out<00:00:50.579> video

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
also my channel so you can see we're not

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.860 
also my channel so you can see we're not
going<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.590> notice<00:00:56.129> any<00:00:56.399> lag<00:00:56.789> in<00:00:57.120> terms<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:57.600> the

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
going to notice any lag in terms of the

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.439 
going to notice any lag in terms of the
software<00:00:58.520> overall<00:00:59.520> performance<00:00:59.820> like

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
software overall performance like

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.660 
software overall performance like
swiping<00:01:00.989> in<00:01:01.170> apps<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.710> everything<00:01:01.770> will<00:01:02.280> feel

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
swiping in apps and everything will feel

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.549 
swiping in apps and everything will feel
really<00:01:03.329> really<00:01:03.570> smooth<00:01:03.870> no<00:01:04.170> problem

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
really really smooth no problem

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:05.359 
really really smooth no problem
whatsoever

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
whatsoever

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.649 
whatsoever
you<00:01:06.119> can<00:01:06.270> see<00:01:06.420> that<00:01:07.520> no<00:01:08.520> lag<00:01:08.760> whatsoever<00:01:09.030> so

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
you can see that no lag whatsoever so

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.460 
you can see that no lag whatsoever so
let's<00:01:09.900> just<00:01:10.110> do<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.590> quick<00:01:11.189> test<00:01:12.000> here<00:01:12.770> and<00:01:13.770> see

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
let's just do a quick test here and see

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.880 
let's just do a quick test here and see
very<00:01:16.470> nice<00:01:16.920> very<00:01:17.549> fast<00:01:18.000> so<00:01:18.810> let's<00:01:19.560> just<00:01:19.770> try

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
very nice very fast so let's just try

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.770 
very nice very fast so let's just try
opening<00:01:20.369> up<00:01:20.520> some<00:01:20.759> applications<00:01:21.479> there<00:01:21.689> at

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
opening up some applications there at

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.820 
opening up some applications there at
the<00:01:21.869> same<00:01:22.049> time<00:01:22.110> so<00:01:22.680> one<00:01:23.009> two<00:01:23.159> three<00:01:23.189> go<00:01:24.830> all

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
the same time so one two three go all

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.990 
the same time so one two three go all
pretty<00:01:26.220> equal<00:01:26.670> there<00:01:27.740> goes<00:01:28.740> here<00:01:29.070> so<00:01:29.340> it's

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
pretty equal there goes here so it's

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.280 
pretty equal there goes here so it's
going<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.270> start<00:01:30.479> off<00:01:30.689> with<00:01:30.960> contacts<00:01:31.710> now

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
going to start off with contacts now

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:38.690 
going to start off with contacts now
equal<00:01:34.310> messaging<00:01:36.140> again<00:01:37.140> equal<00:01:37.680> let's<00:01:38.400> open

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
equal messaging again equal let's open

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.359 
equal messaging again equal let's open
up<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.390> gallery<00:01:40.369> one<00:01:41.369> two<00:01:41.549> three<00:01:41.790> go<00:01:42.950> it<00:01:43.950> seems

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
up the gallery one two three go it seems

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.340 
up the gallery one two three go it seems
like<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.670> GFI<00:01:45.060> ball<00:01:45.299> is<00:01:45.390> slightly<00:01:45.689> faster

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
like the GFI ball is slightly faster

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.270 
like the GFI ball is slightly faster
slightly<00:01:47.090> let's<00:01:48.090> open<00:01:48.240> up<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.659> memo<00:01:49.590> versus

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
slightly let's open up the memo versus

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.830 
slightly let's open up the memo versus
the<00:01:50.430> memo<00:01:50.700> one<00:01:51.240> two<00:01:51.420> three<00:01:51.659> go<00:01:53.270> rather<00:01:54.270> equal

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
the memo one two three go rather equal

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.410 
the memo one two three go rather equal
there<00:01:55.110> let's<00:01:55.680> open<00:01:55.950> up<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:57.079> calculator<00:01:59.420> now

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
there let's open up the calculator now

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.310 
there let's open up the calculator now
let's<00:02:00.689> just<00:02:00.810> open<00:02:01.020> up<00:02:01.079> settings<00:02:01.290> first<00:02:01.680> we<00:02:02.340> go

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
let's just open up settings first we go

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.190 
let's just open up settings first we go
seems<00:02:04.320> like<00:02:04.500> a<00:02:04.710> five<00:02:05.280> was<00:02:05.579> slightly<00:02:06.420> faster

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
seems like a five was slightly faster

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.010 
seems like a five was slightly faster
not<00:02:07.439> that<00:02:07.710> much<00:02:08.009> of<00:02:08.280> difference<00:02:09.239> of<00:02:09.690> open<00:02:09.929> up

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
not that much of difference of open up

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.980 
not that much of difference of open up
calculator

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
calculator

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.840 
calculator
pretty<00:02:12.990> equal<00:02:13.440> you<00:02:14.070> can<00:02:14.220> see<00:02:14.400> that<00:02:14.610> even

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
pretty equal you can see that even

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.180 
pretty equal you can see that even
though<00:02:15.150> there<00:02:15.390> are<00:02:15.420> budget<00:02:15.870> films<00:02:16.410> but<00:02:16.590> but<00:02:17.160> I

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
though there are budget films but but I

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.890 
though there are budget films but but I
really<00:02:17.700> do<00:02:17.850> enjoy<00:02:18.050> their<00:02:19.050> speed<00:02:19.440> and<00:02:19.710> you<00:02:20.700> know

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
really do enjoy their speed and you know

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.060
