00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:14.960 
comparing the barricade and the stockade

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.330 
comparing the barricade and the stockade
let's<00:00:15.960> start<00:00:16.199> out<00:00:16.320> with<00:00:16.470> a<00:00:16.529> short<00:00:17.130> review

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
let's start out with a short review

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.980 
let's start out with a short review
basically<00:00:18.210> almost<00:00:18.510> both<00:00:19.289> of<00:00:19.439> these<00:00:19.560> guns<00:00:19.800> have

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 
basically almost both of these guns have

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.259 
basically almost both of these guns have
the<00:00:21.990> these<00:00:22.859> guns<00:00:23.070> are<00:00:23.220> both<00:00:23.369> flywheel<00:00:23.939> so<00:00:24.150> they

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
the these guns are both flywheel so they

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.000 
the these guns are both flywheel so they
both<00:00:24.390> have<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.600> revving<00:00:24.990> they<00:00:25.650> both<00:00:25.859> have<00:00:25.980> a

which<00:00:39.930> actually<00:00:40.530> act<00:00:40.710> deactivates<00:00:41.520> the

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
which actually act deactivates the

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.420 
which actually act deactivates the
switch<00:00:42.660> so<00:00:42.989> you<00:00:43.050> can't<00:00:43.290> turn<00:00:43.410> on<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.739> flywheel

switch so you can't turn on the flywheel

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.060 
switch so you can't turn on the flywheel

piece you can't the stock this one have

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.529 
piece you can't the stock this one have
the<00:00:49.140> stock<00:00:49.320> right<00:00:49.649> now<00:00:49.910> the<00:00:50.910> major<00:00:51.090> difference

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
the stock right now the major difference

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.770 
the stock right now the major difference
is<00:00:51.770> I'll<00:00:52.770> show<00:00:52.829> you<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.579> elites<00:00:54.059> gun<00:00:54.390> the

is I'll show you the elites gun the

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.779 
is I'll show you the elites gun the

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
stockade what this gun has and this

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.900 
stockade what this gun has and this
barricade<00:00:57.510> does<00:00:57.750> not<00:00:58.160> first<00:00:59.160> off<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.579> stock

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
barricade does not first off the stock

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.880 
barricade does not first off the stock
it<00:01:00.149> comes<00:01:00.359> with<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.539> nice<00:01:00.719> stock<00:01:01.050> has<00:01:01.590> ten

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
it comes with a nice stock has ten

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.880 
it comes with a nice stock has ten
rounds<00:01:02.309> five<00:01:03.000> rounds<00:01:03.270> on<00:01:03.359> each<00:01:03.480> side<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:04.019> the

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
rounds five rounds on each side and the

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.010 
rounds five rounds on each side and the
the<00:01:05.430> darts<00:01:05.729> they<00:01:06.000> actually<00:01:06.510> don't<00:01:06.659> fall<00:01:06.900> out

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
the darts they actually don't fall out

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.510 
the darts they actually don't fall out
very<00:01:07.200> easily<00:01:07.409> it's<00:01:07.650> really<00:01:07.890> nice<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.250> stock<00:01:08.490> I

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
very easily it's really nice the stock I

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.410 
very easily it's really nice the stock I
really<00:01:08.790> love<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.030> stock<00:01:09.890> also<00:01:10.890> this<00:01:11.610> gun<00:01:11.790> uses

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
really love the stock also this gun uses

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.679 
really love the stock also this gun uses
the<00:01:12.600> elite<00:01:13.020> darts<00:01:13.260> so<00:01:14.270> it's<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.360> lot<00:01:15.540> different

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
the elite darts so it's a lot different

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.760 
the elite darts so it's a lot different
because<00:01:16.020> of<00:01:16.470> these<00:01:16.830> darts<00:01:17.130> right<00:01:17.189> here<00:01:17.520> the

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
because of these darts right here the

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.410 
because of these darts right here the
flywheel<00:01:19.770> on<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:20.070> inside<00:01:20.400> is<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.700> lot<00:01:20.939> smaller

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
flywheel on the inside is a lot smaller

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.679 
flywheel on the inside is a lot smaller
in<00:01:21.720> here<00:01:21.990> so<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:22.979> actually<00:01:23.400> pushes<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.360> whole

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
in here so it actually pushes a whole

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.020 
in here so it actually pushes a whole
entire<00:01:24.960> dart<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:26.040> whole<00:01:26.250> entire<00:01:26.490> foam<00:01:26.790> piece

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
entire dart the whole entire foam piece

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.200 
entire dart the whole entire foam piece
rather<00:01:27.360> than<00:01:27.600> just<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.259> fat<00:01:29.250> Whistler<00:01:29.729> tip<00:01:29.909> of

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
rather than just the fat Whistler tip of

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.109 
rather than just the fat Whistler tip of
the<00:01:30.479> barricade<00:01:31.079> so<00:01:32.070> it's<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.400> lot<00:01:32.579> better<00:01:32.759> in

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
the barricade so it's a lot better in

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.270 
the barricade so it's a lot better in
the<00:01:33.270> range<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.869> accuracy<00:01:34.259> because<00:01:34.710> of<00:01:35.159> that

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
the range and accuracy because of that

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.920 
the range and accuracy because of that
reason<00:01:35.549> how<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.000> uses<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.420> elite<00:01:36.750> darts

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
reason how it uses the elite darts

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.800 
reason how it uses the elite darts
that's<00:01:37.619> really<00:01:37.920> cool<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.369> also<00:01:38.700> when<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.630> rev

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
that's really cool and also when you rev

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.679 
that's really cool and also when you rev
the<00:01:39.960> guns<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:42.350> stockade<00:01:43.490> revs<00:01:44.490> very<00:01:45.119> fast<00:01:45.479> to

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
the guns the stockade revs very fast to

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.109 
the guns the stockade revs very fast to
type<00:01:45.930> speed<00:01:46.350> it<00:01:46.560> goes<00:01:46.770> up<00:01:47.009> really<00:01:47.549> fast<00:01:47.759> where

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
type speed it goes up really fast where

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.410 
type speed it goes up really fast where
the<00:01:48.299> barricade<00:01:49.259> seems<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.399> be<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.270> little

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
the barricade seems to be a little

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.609 
the barricade seems to be a little
slower<00:01:52.850> it<00:01:53.850> takes<00:01:54.149> like<00:01:54.450> maybe<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:55.200> half<00:01:55.530> a

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
slower it takes like maybe a half a

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.039 
slower it takes like maybe a half a
second<00:01:55.979> longer<00:01:56.100> I'd<00:01:56.490> say<00:01:56.820> for<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.689> get<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:57.869> the

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
second longer I'd say for to get to the

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.410 
second longer I'd say for to get to the
highest<00:01:58.229> speed<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:58.950> then<00:01:59.610> also<00:01:59.850> this<00:02:00.210> one

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
highest speed and then also this one

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.480 
highest speed and then also this one
seems<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.719> be<00:02:00.869> a<00:02:00.899> lot<00:02:01.170> quieter<00:02:01.619> which<00:02:02.040> I<00:02:02.159> really

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
seems to be a lot quieter which I really

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.149 
seems to be a lot quieter which I really
really<00:02:02.520> like<00:02:02.759> for<00:02:03.329> conclusion<00:02:03.899> because<00:02:04.680> this

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
really like for conclusion because this

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.839 
really like for conclusion because this

be shooting the barricade first and then

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:56.330 
be shooting the barricade first and then
I'll<00:02:39.680> just<00:02:39.799> talking

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.610 

all<00:02:57.340> right<00:02:57.550> so<00:02:57.730> the<00:02:57.850> barricade<00:02:58.360> shot<00:02:58.660> from<00:02:58.870> 18

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
all right so the barricade shot from 18

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.890 
all right so the barricade shot from 18
feet<00:02:59.860> to<00:03:00.160> 30<00:03:00.370> feet<00:03:00.700> while<00:03:00.940> the<00:03:00.970> stockade<00:03:01.600> shot

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
feet to 30 feet while the stockade shot

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.980 
feet to 30 feet while the stockade shot
around<00:03:02.080> 25<00:03:02.800> feet<00:03:03.130> to<00:03:03.550> 40<00:03:03.940> feet<00:03:04.180> that's<00:03:04.750> about

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
around 25 feet to 40 feet that's about

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.110 
around 25 feet to 40 feet that's about
an<00:03:05.110> eight<00:03:05.260> foot<00:03:05.500> increase<00:03:05.980> in<00:03:06.160> at<00:03:06.310> and<00:03:06.520> range

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
an eight foot increase in at and range

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.330 
an eight foot increase in at and range
but<00:03:07.660> the<00:03:07.900> accuracy<00:03:08.260> of<00:03:08.500> the<00:03:08.680> stockade<00:03:09.100> is

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
but the accuracy of the stockade is

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.100 
but the accuracy of the stockade is
probably<00:03:09.670> a<00:03:09.730> little<00:03:09.850> bit<00:03:10.030> better<00:03:10.180> also<00:03:10.450> they

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
probably a little bit better also they

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.330 
probably a little bit better also they
seem<00:03:11.320> to<00:03:11.440> be<00:03:11.530> a<00:03:11.560> little<00:03:11.680> bit<00:03:11.800> less<00:03:11.980> step

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
seem to be a little bit less step

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.420 
seem to be a little bit less step
staggered<00:03:13.270> like<00:03:13.300> the<00:03:13.750> barricade<00:03:14.680> was<00:03:14.830> so<00:03:15.400> I

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
staggered like the barricade was so I

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.190 
staggered like the barricade was so I
definitely<00:03:15.910> say<00:03:16.240> that<00:03:16.390> the<00:03:16.450> stock<00:03:16.870> it<00:03:17.050> was<00:03:17.170> a

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
definitely say that the stock it was a

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.270 
definitely say that the stock it was a
lot<00:03:17.380> better<00:03:17.560> in<00:03:17.680> the<00:03:17.740> range<00:03:17.950> and<00:03:18.040> accuracy

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
lot better in the range and accuracy

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.280 
lot better in the range and accuracy
