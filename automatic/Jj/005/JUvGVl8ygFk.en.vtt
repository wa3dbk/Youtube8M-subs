00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
whether or not you understand the basic

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.800 
whether or not you understand the basic
fundamentals<00:02:21.160> of<00:02:21.310> the<00:02:21.430> science<00:02:21.940> associated

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
fundamentals of the science associated

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.580 
fundamentals of the science associated
with<00:02:23.110> that<00:02:23.260> job<00:02:23.560> so<00:02:24.750> imagine<00:02:25.750> you're<00:02:25.959> in<00:02:25.989> a

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
with that job so imagine you're in a

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.900 
with that job so imagine you're in a
rowboat<00:02:27.310> in<00:02:28.090> a<00:02:29.019> pond<00:02:29.349> you<00:02:30.220> have<00:02:30.310> an<00:02:30.430> anchor<00:02:30.819> in

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
rowboat in a pond you have an anchor in

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.780 
rowboat in a pond you have an anchor in
the<00:02:31.000> boat<00:02:31.209> you<00:02:31.959> throw<00:02:32.170> it<00:02:32.319> overboard<00:02:32.560> it<00:02:33.550> goes

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
the boat you throw it overboard it goes

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.440 
the boat you throw it overboard it goes
into<00:02:34.120> the<00:02:34.360> bottom<00:02:34.660> of<00:02:34.750> the<00:02:34.810> tank<00:02:35.849> in<00:02:36.849> that<00:02:36.940> pond

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
into the bottom of the tank in that pond

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.660 
into the bottom of the tank in that pond
or<00:02:37.720> tank<00:02:38.019> does<00:02:38.860> the<00:02:39.010> water<00:02:39.220> rise<00:02:39.610> or<00:02:40.090> lower

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
or tank does the water rise or lower

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.210 
or tank does the water rise or lower
again<00:02:42.670> some<00:02:43.209> basic<00:02:43.690> scientific<00:02:44.530> fundamentals

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
again some basic scientific fundamentals

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.449 
again some basic scientific fundamentals
as<00:02:45.430> to<00:02:45.760> how<00:02:46.569> you<00:02:46.630> get<00:02:46.959> to<00:02:47.140> that<00:02:47.290> answer<00:02:47.560> there's

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
as to how you get to that answer there's

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.460 
as to how you get to that answer there's
also<00:02:48.700> some<00:02:49.060> sort<00:02:49.540> of<00:02:49.569> problem<00:02:49.930> solving

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
also some sort of problem solving

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.970 
also some sort of problem solving
questions<00:02:50.709> like<00:02:51.959> give<00:02:52.959> me<00:02:53.110> your<00:02:53.530> evacuation

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
questions like give me your evacuation

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.600 
questions like give me your evacuation
plan<00:02:54.849> for<00:02:55.150> the<00:02:55.209> city<00:02:55.420> of<00:02:55.480> Los<00:02:55.690> Angeles<00:02:56.610> well
