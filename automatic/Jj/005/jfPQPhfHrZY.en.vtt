00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
and as you can see gravel are very very

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.109 
and as you can see gravel are very very
small<00:00:25.109> and<00:00:25.380> sharp<00:00:25.710> little<00:00:26.189> tiny<00:00:26.430> rocks<00:00:26.730> the

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.770 
swallowed gravel in the past and he's
luckily<00:01:38.130> passed<00:01:38.400> through<00:01:38.820> him<00:01:39.090> so<00:01:39.450> would<00:01:39.659> you

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
luckily passed through him so would you

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.050 
luckily passed through him so would you
really<00:01:40.049> really<00:01:40.320> want<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.619> take<00:01:40.890> that<00:01:41.159> risk<00:01:41.490> it

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
really really want to take that risk it

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.330 
really really want to take that risk it
could<00:01:42.360> happen<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:43.020> it<00:01:43.110> does<00:01:43.439> happen<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:44.130> it's

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
could happen and it does happen and it's

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.830 
could happen and it does happen and it's
a<00:01:44.430> lottery<00:01:44.729> that<00:01:44.970> I<00:01:45.000> wouldn't<00:01:45.420> really<00:01:45.540> want<00:01:45.780> to

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
a lottery that I wouldn't really want to

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.899 
a lottery that I wouldn't really want to
play<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.350> I'm<00:01:46.799> sure<00:01:47.040> that<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.399> wouldn't<00:01:47.729> want

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
play and I'm sure that you wouldn't want

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.880 
play and I'm sure that you wouldn't want
the<00:01:48.030> turtle<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:48.509> get<00:01:48.659> sick<00:01:48.930> have<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.409> go<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.619> the

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
the turtle to get sick have to go to the

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.819 
the turtle to get sick have to go to the
vet<00:01:50.100> have<00:01:50.549> surgery<00:01:51.240> or<00:01:51.540> potentially<00:01:52.229> die<00:01:52.500> and

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
vet have surgery or potentially die and

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.679 
vet have surgery or potentially die and
like<00:01:53.070> I<00:01:53.220> said<00:01:53.280> I<00:01:53.460> can't<00:01:53.700> stress<00:01:54.119> this<00:01:54.360> does

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
like I said I can't stress this does

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.929 
like I said I can't stress this does
happen<00:01:55.049> so<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.619> sixth<00:01:56.100> on<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:56.219> bag<00:01:56.490> of<00:01:56.670> gravel

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
happen so a sixth on a bag of gravel

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.819 
happen so a sixth on a bag of gravel
really<00:01:57.509> isn't<00:01:57.659> worth<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.290> life<00:01:58.530> of<00:01:58.710> your

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
really isn't worth the life of your

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.830 
really isn't worth the life of your
turtle<00:01:59.280> and<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.880> second<00:02:00.270> question<00:02:00.600> I<00:02:00.689> get

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
turtle and the second question I get

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.170 
turtle and the second question I get
asked<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.229> lot<00:02:01.259> is<00:02:01.770> how<00:02:01.829> comes<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.700> turtles<00:02:03.090> are

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
asked a lot is how comes the turtles are

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.730 
asked a lot is how comes the turtles are
fine<00:02:03.450> in<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.689> wild<00:02:04.079> that<00:02:04.259> may<00:02:04.409> encounter

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
fine in the wild that may encounter

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.649 
fine in the wild that may encounter
gravity<00:02:05.250> in<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.430> wild<00:02:05.790> don't<00:02:06.090> they<00:02:06.299> swallow

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
gravity in the wild don't they swallow

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.839 
gravity in the wild don't they swallow
in<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.020> wild<00:02:07.439> well<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.770> thing<00:02:08.009> is<00:02:08.039> yes<00:02:08.580> they

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
in the wild well the thing is yes they

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.630 
in the wild well the thing is yes they
probably<00:02:09.090> do<00:02:09.810> when<00:02:10.349> a<00:02:10.379> turtle<00:02:10.649> is<00:02:10.920> in<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.190> wild

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
probably do when a turtle is in the wild

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.910 
probably do when a turtle is in the wild
it<00:02:11.849> does<00:02:12.209> have

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
it does have

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.280 
it does have
very<00:02:13.040> diverse<00:02:13.610> and<00:02:13.849> large<00:02:14.120> habitat<00:02:14.390> so<00:02:15.050> it<00:02:15.170> has

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
very diverse and large habitat so it has

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.290 
very diverse and large habitat so it has
a<00:02:15.319> lot<00:02:15.530> of<00:02:15.560> things<00:02:15.860> to<00:02:16.069> encounter<00:02:16.819> so<00:02:17.180> the

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
a lot of things to encounter so the

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.449 
a lot of things to encounter so the
thing<00:02:17.540> is<00:02:17.569> with<00:02:17.810> a<00:02:17.870> captive<00:02:18.319> turtle<00:02:18.890> they<00:02:19.280> are

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
thing is with a captive turtle they are

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.640 
thing is with a captive turtle they are
kept<00:02:19.819> in<00:02:19.970> tanks<00:02:20.569> a<00:02:20.690> lot<00:02:20.810> smaller<00:02:21.230> than<00:02:21.410> the

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
kept in tanks a lot smaller than the

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.010 
kept in tanks a lot smaller than the
habitat<00:02:22.069> they<00:02:22.190> will<00:02:22.370> be<00:02:22.550> in<00:02:22.730> the<00:02:22.880> wild<00:02:23.390> now

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
habitat they will be in the wild now

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.080 
habitat they will be in the wild now
turtles<00:02:24.590> are<00:02:24.680> very<00:02:24.860> curious<00:02:25.099> creatures<00:02:25.849> and

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
turtles are very curious creatures and

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.670 
turtles are very curious creatures and
they<00:02:26.270> can<00:02:26.540> get<00:02:26.720> bored<00:02:26.959> and<00:02:27.110> they<00:02:27.200> can<00:02:27.410> play

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
they can get bored and they can play

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.070 
they can get bored and they can play
with<00:02:27.890> the<00:02:27.950> things<00:02:28.220> in<00:02:28.370> their<00:02:28.550> tank<00:02:28.819> so<00:02:29.450> gravel

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
with the things in their tank so gravel

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.260 
with the things in their tank so gravel
to<00:02:30.290> them<00:02:30.470> it<00:02:30.650> will<00:02:30.800> be<00:02:31.040> just<00:02:31.400> another<00:02:31.760> toy<00:02:32.030> to

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
to them it will be just another toy to

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.630 
to them it will be just another toy to
play<00:02:32.480> with<00:02:32.750> or<00:02:32.930> even<00:02:33.680> another<00:02:33.860> food<00:02:34.190> source<00:02:34.220> if

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
play with or even another food source if

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.340 
play with or even another food source if
they<00:02:34.760> get<00:02:34.940> a<00:02:34.970> little<00:02:35.270> snackage<00:02:35.600> because<00:02:36.230> in

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
they get a little snackage because in

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.140 
they get a little snackage because in
the<00:02:36.440> wild<00:02:36.800> they'd<00:02:36.980> be<00:02:37.040> bugs<00:02:37.430> and<00:02:37.819> they'd<00:02:37.970> be

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
the wild they'd be bugs and they'd be

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.820 
the wild they'd be bugs and they'd be
fish<00:02:38.480> and<00:02:38.810> all<00:02:38.900> sorts<00:02:39.170> of<00:02:39.200> wildlife<00:02:39.709> and

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
fish and all sorts of wildlife and

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.100 
fish and all sorts of wildlife and
plants<00:02:40.220> on<00:02:40.340> hand<00:02:40.640> all<00:02:40.790> the<00:02:40.880> time<00:02:41.090> for<00:02:41.390> them<00:02:41.569> so

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
plants on hand all the time for them so

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.140 
plants on hand all the time for them so
in<00:02:42.380> their<00:02:42.590> tank<00:02:43.040> they<00:02:43.519> might<00:02:43.730> decide<00:02:44.090> that

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
in their tank they might decide that

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.240 
in their tank they might decide that
that<00:02:44.420> gravels<00:02:44.900> looking<00:02:45.200> a<00:02:45.290> little<00:02:45.530> tasty<00:02:46.040> and

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
that gravels looking a little tasty and

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.830 
that gravels looking a little tasty and
there<00:02:46.430> can<00:02:46.580> be<00:02:46.610> a<00:02:46.700> reason<00:02:47.090> why<00:02:47.209> sometimes<00:02:47.480> they

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
there can be a reason why sometimes they

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.979 
there can be a reason why sometimes they
swallow<00:02:48.230> it<00:02:48.470> now<00:02:49.040> also<00:02:49.360> Turtles<00:02:50.360> probably<00:02:50.810> do

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
swallow it now also Turtles probably do

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:52.900 
swallow it now also Turtles probably do
swallow<00:02:51.410> an<00:02:51.709> D<00:02:51.920> gravel<00:02:52.310> in<00:02:52.370> the<00:02:52.459> world<00:02:52.670> I'm

swallow an D gravel in the world I'm
sure<00:02:53.150> it<00:02:53.360> does<00:02:53.569> happen

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
sure it does happen

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.710

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
I do know that something quite read and

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.770 
I do know that something quite read and
seen<00:03:13.130> for<00:03:13.340> myself<00:03:13.489> you<00:03:14.180> only<00:03:14.330> have<00:03:14.540> to<00:03:14.660> go

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
seen for myself you only have to go

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.990 
seen for myself you only have to go
online<00:03:14.989> and<00:03:15.200> google<00:03:15.830> this<00:03:16.010> and<00:03:16.250> find<00:03:16.519> out<00:03:16.700> that

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
online and google this and find out that

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.630 
online and google this and find out that
yes<00:03:17.239> this<00:03:17.540> does<00:03:17.840> happen<00:03:18.140> it's<00:03:18.590> a<00:03:19.040> real<00:03:19.310> thing

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
yes this does happen it's a real thing

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.000 
yes this does happen it's a real thing
so<00:03:20.329> if<00:03:20.480> this<00:03:20.570> has<00:03:20.750> convinced<00:03:21.290> you<00:03:21.470> to<00:03:21.500> not<00:03:21.980> use

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
so if this has convinced you to not use

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.550 
so if this has convinced you to not use
gravel<00:03:22.640> in<00:03:22.790> your<00:03:22.940> turtle<00:03:23.329> tank<00:03:23.600> and<00:03:23.930> I<00:03:24.140> do<00:03:24.200> have

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
gravel in your turtle tank and I do have

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.890 
gravel in your turtle tank and I do have
a<00:03:24.590> few<00:03:24.890> ideas<00:03:25.040> of<00:03:25.519> substrate<00:03:26.000> you<00:03:26.150> can<00:03:26.359> use<00:03:26.630> you

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
a few ideas of substrate you can use you

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.020 
a few ideas of substrate you can use you
could<00:03:27.140> have<00:03:27.440> a<00:03:27.470> bare<00:03:27.829> bottom<00:03:28.160> tank<00:03:28.190> right<00:03:29.000> now

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
could have a bare bottom tank right now

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.390 
could have a bare bottom tank right now
that's<00:03:29.570> exactly<00:03:30.109> what<00:03:30.260> I<00:03:30.290> have<00:03:30.680> but<00:03:31.010> this<00:03:31.190> is

going to change I'm not going to have a

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.770 
going to change I'm not going to have a
bare<00:03:33.739> bottom<00:03:34.040> tank<00:03:34.070> forever<00:03:34.910> but<00:03:35.450> for<00:03:35.660> now

they<00:03:49.070> are<00:03:49.190> extremely<00:03:49.910> easy<00:03:49.940> to<00:03:50.329> clean<00:03:50.660> and

quite<00:03:59.090> entertaining

quite entertaining

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:02.199 
quite entertaining
that's<00:04:00.530> another<00:04:00.799> downside<00:04:01.069> to<00:04:01.489> gravel<00:04:01.819> also

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
that's another downside to gravel also

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:04.240 
that's another downside to gravel also
as<00:04:02.450> it<00:04:02.600> can<00:04:02.750> be<00:04:02.900> very<00:04:03.109> difficult<00:04:03.350> to<00:04:03.739> clean<00:04:03.920> and

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
as it can be very difficult to clean and

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.250 
as it can be very difficult to clean and
Harbor<00:04:04.670> a<00:04:04.700> lot<00:04:04.790> of<00:04:05.000> bacteria<00:04:05.060> and<00:04:05.780> algae<00:04:05.989> in

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
Harbor a lot of bacteria and algae in

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.199 
Harbor a lot of bacteria and algae in
the<00:04:06.290> tank<00:04:06.620> so<00:04:06.980> I<00:04:07.010> think<00:04:07.160> that<00:04:07.579> polished<00:04:07.970> River

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
the tank so I think that polished River

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:10.720 
the tank so I think that polished River
rocks<00:04:08.420> are<00:04:08.720> probably<00:04:09.350> the<00:04:09.620> best<00:04:09.950> option<00:04:10.190> I'm

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
rocks are probably the best option I'm

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.550 
rocks are probably the best option I'm
going<00:04:10.970> to<00:04:11.090> use<00:04:11.180> this<00:04:11.359> total<00:04:11.720> tank<00:04:11.930> and<00:04:12.170> they

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
going to use this total tank and they

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.590 
going to use this total tank and they
are<00:04:12.620> relatively<00:04:13.130> inexpensive<00:04:13.280> you<00:04:14.150> can<00:04:14.180> buy

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:14.600 
are relatively inexpensive you can buy

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.960 
are relatively inexpensive you can buy
them<00:04:14.870> from<00:04:15.109> most<00:04:15.410> pet<00:04:15.829> stores<00:04:16.190> or<00:04:16.579> maybe<00:04:16.789> in

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970

your local garden center they have them

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:20.229 
your local garden center they have them
sometimes<00:04:19.190> I<00:04:19.280> use<00:04:19.430> them<00:04:19.549> for<00:04:19.579> landscaping

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
sometimes I use them for landscaping

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.600 
sometimes I use them for landscaping
just<00:04:20.840> make<00:04:21.080> sure<00:04:21.320> that<00:04:21.380> they<00:04:21.739> are<00:04:21.890> untreated

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.290 
bottom of the tank sand is great and
it's<00:04:44.440> also<00:04:44.590> very<00:04:44.800> very<00:04:45.370> pretty<00:04:45.670> but<00:04:46.120> it's

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
it's also very very pretty but it's

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.390 
it's also very very pretty but it's
extremely<00:04:46.780> difficult<00:04:47.050> to<00:04:47.380> clean<00:04:47.830> and<00:04:48.130> if

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
extremely difficult to clean and if

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.460 
extremely difficult to clean and if
you're<00:04:48.550> like<00:04:48.760> me<00:04:49.090> that<00:04:49.120> has<00:04:49.600> a<00:04:49.630> filter<00:04:50.140> with<00:04:50.350> an

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
you're like me that has a filter with an

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.200 
you're like me that has a filter with an
intake<00:04:50.830> that<00:04:51.250> sits<00:04:51.550> on<00:04:51.670> the<00:04:51.730> bottom<00:04:52.060> of<00:04:52.150> the

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
intake that sits on the bottom of the

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.570 
intake that sits on the bottom of the
tanks<00:04:52.540> floor<00:04:52.810> it<00:04:53.350> can<00:04:53.680> actually<00:04:54.070> suck<00:04:54.310> up<00:04:54.460> the

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
tanks floor it can actually suck up the

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.030 
tanks floor it can actually suck up the
sand<00:04:54.820> and<00:04:55.030> clog<00:04:55.240> your<00:04:55.390> filter<00:04:55.840> so<00:04:56.260> sand<00:04:56.650> is

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.040 
sand and clog your filter so sand is

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.680 
sand and clog your filter so sand is
perfectly<00:04:57.460> fine<00:04:57.730> but<00:04:58.000> like<00:04:58.090> I<00:04:58.150> said<00:04:58.360> it<00:04:58.510> can<00:04:58.660> be

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:58.690 
perfectly fine but like I said it can be

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.120 
perfectly fine but like I said it can be
a<00:04:58.810> little<00:04:58.990> more<00:04:59.080> difficult<00:04:59.470> to<00:04:59.530> use<00:04:59.620> and

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.130 
a little more difficult to use and

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:02.280 
a little more difficult to use and
requires<00:05:00.550> more<00:05:00.880> care<00:05:01.240> so<00:05:01.750> hope<00:05:01.990> this<00:05:02.020> has<00:05:02.260> been

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:02.290 
requires more care so hope this has been

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:04.770 
requires more care so hope this has been
informative<00:05:02.590> and<00:05:03.490> it<00:05:03.940> puts<00:05:04.120> some<00:05:04.240> light<00:05:04.510> on

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
informative and it puts some light on

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.960 
informative and it puts some light on
what<00:05:05.170> I<00:05:05.410> definitely<00:05:06.220> do<00:05:06.370> not<00:05:06.520> agree<00:05:06.700> with<00:05:06.790> the

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
what I definitely do not agree with the

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:08.490 
what I definitely do not agree with the
use<00:05:07.120> of<00:05:07.150> gravel<00:05:07.570> in<00:05:07.660> a<00:05:07.690> turtle<00:05:08.020> tank<00:05:08.200> and

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
use of gravel in a turtle tank and

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.560 
use of gravel in a turtle tank and
hopefully<00:05:09.040> this<00:05:09.580> will<00:05:09.850> encourage<00:05:10.150> you<00:05:10.420> to

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570 
hopefully this will encourage you to

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:12.450 
hopefully this will encourage you to
make<00:05:10.780> the<00:05:10.810> change<00:05:11.350> if<00:05:11.680> you<00:05:11.980> are<00:05:12.160> currently

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
make the change if you are currently

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.850 
make the change if you are currently
using<00:05:12.640> gravel<00:05:13.330> if<00:05:13.480> you<00:05:13.990> have<00:05:14.170> any<00:05:14.320> questions
