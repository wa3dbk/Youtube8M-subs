00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.969
 the cologne on this weekend 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.559
 dreary 0 0 against loud 1 4 0 victory 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.879
 via cottbus a 9 1 im 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.550
 friendly match against the 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.610

 that all adds up to 79 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.640
 percent performance out of here 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.800
 All in all, in the duels 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.750
 the two eight times against mainz as 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.339
 winners of the third place draw and 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.760
 seven cologne victories 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.830
 The scorers for Mainz in the cup Eric 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.299
 maxim choupo moting with a bottom 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.450
 nicolai mÃ¼ller also with a goal 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:20.790
 at cologne it's marcel cracks and maxi 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:23.610
 Thiel with a goal ever in Cologne 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.369
 first cup against trier with 2 0 in 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.200
 pulled in the next round 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:32.009
 mainz in the first round of the cup 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.140
 fortuna cologne 2 1 won so nudge 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.509
 here mainz possibly the second cologne 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.090
 team from the cup 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.189
 you do not know it in my opinion 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:46.710
 this is a pretty close game 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:48.240
 actually and I think even it works 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.750
 in the extension maybe even in the 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.369
 makes eleven-meter shooting except mainz 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.579
 again such a surprise coup as 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.080
 once where she does not know then in the 100 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.390
 19 or so 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.600
 to play the game in the short term 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.770
 would have been last cup season 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:09.570
 So I say it goes into the extension 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:12.090
 with 1 1 and then cologne is the winner 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:15.020
 from the square and I say 2 1 victory for 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.020
 cologne after hall
