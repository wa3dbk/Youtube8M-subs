scrapbook thing
which<00:04:23.650> I<00:04:23.770> made<00:04:23.980> him<00:04:24.160> these<00:04:24.370> lands<00:04:24.640> are<00:04:24.850> clear

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270

which I made him these lands are clear
and<00:04:25.570> there<00:04:25.870> were<00:04:25.960> two<00:04:26.140> pounds<00:04:26.470> for<00:04:26.500> 500<00:04:27.160> and

and there were two pounds for 500 and

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.030 
and there were two pounds for 500 and

then I got these ones which are silver
and<00:04:30.310> I<00:04:30.760> think<00:04:30.970> we've<00:04:31.060> got<00:04:31.180> about<00:04:31.270> 200<00:04:31.780> of<00:04:31.900> these

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.290 
and I think we've got about 200 of these
I<00:04:32.080> know<00:04:32.350> about<00:04:32.590> five<00:04:32.950> pounds<00:04:33.400> for<00:04:33.880> all<00:04:34.000> of<00:04:34.120> them

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
but don't know where they are I think

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.320
