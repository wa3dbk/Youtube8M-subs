00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:04.299 
that's why is and then you have your

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:07.350 
that's why is and then you have your
boots<00:02:04.710> obviously<00:02:05.710> which<00:02:06.640> you<00:02:06.850> complete

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
boots obviously which you complete

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:13.110
