in<00:00:01.490> this<00:00:01.640> video<00:00:01.849> I'm<00:00:02.120> going<00:00:02.210> to<00:00:02.270> give<00:00:02.419> you<00:00:02.510> a

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:02.570 
in this video I'm going to give you a

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:04.529 
in this video I'm going to give you a
tour<00:00:02.780> of<00:00:02.870> our<00:00:03.080> backyard<00:00:03.500> aquaponic<00:00:03.980> system

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:04.539 
tour of our backyard aquaponic system

00:00:04.539 --> 00:00:08.740 
tour of our backyard aquaponic system
come<00:00:05.539> on<00:00:05.660> in<00:00:06.970> aquaponics<00:00:07.970> is<00:00:08.090> really<00:00:08.360> simple

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:08.750 
come on in aquaponics is really simple

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.020 
come on in aquaponics is really simple
and<00:00:08.870> its<00:00:08.990> basic<00:00:09.139> concept<00:00:09.860> you're<00:00:10.759> growing

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:11.030 
and its basic concept you're growing

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.489 
and its basic concept you're growing
fish<00:00:11.330> and<00:00:11.769> vegetables<00:00:12.769> together<00:00:12.950> and<00:00:14.499> we're

00:00:15.489 --> 00:00:15.499 
fish and vegetables together and we're

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:18.130 
fish and vegetables together and we're
using<00:00:15.679> all<00:00:16.010> the<00:00:16.160> fish<00:00:17.000> waste<00:00:17.240> as<00:00:17.540> an<00:00:17.750> organic

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.140 
using all the fish waste as an organic

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.900 
using all the fish waste as an organic
fertilizer<00:00:18.590> for<00:00:18.890> our<00:00:18.980> vegetable<00:00:19.400> crops<00:00:19.610> and

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:19.910 
fertilizer for our vegetable crops and

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.140 
fertilizer for our vegetable crops and
these<00:00:20.480> grow<00:00:20.780> beds<00:00:21.370> with<00:00:22.370> all<00:00:22.490> the<00:00:22.610> plants<00:00:23.030> and

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.150 
these grow beds with all the plants and

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.000 
these grow beds with all the plants and
all<00:00:23.240> the<00:00:23.330> bacteria<00:00:23.480> that<00:00:23.780> grow<00:00:24.440> inside<00:00:24.800> the

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.010 
all the bacteria that grow inside the

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.320 
all the bacteria that grow inside the
bed<00:00:26.110> that<00:00:27.110> all<00:00:27.230> filters<00:00:27.650> the<00:00:27.860> water<00:00:28.210> keep<00:00:29.210> it

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330 
bed that all filters the water keep it

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.400 
bed that all filters the water keep it
really<00:00:29.630> clean<00:00:29.660> for<00:00:30.020> your<00:00:30.140> fish<00:00:31.270> but<00:00:32.270> see<00:00:33.020> the

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
really clean for your fish but see the

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.980 
really clean for your fish but see the
cycle<00:00:33.770> starts<00:00:34.070> down<00:00:34.310> here<00:00:34.640> at<00:00:35.210> our<00:00:35.540> in<00:00:35.900> our

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:35.990 
cycle starts down here at our in our

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.350 
cycle starts down here at our in our
something<00:00:36.560> it's<00:00:37.490> the<00:00:37.580> lowest<00:00:37.910> point<00:00:38.120> in<00:00:38.240> our

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
something it's the lowest point in our

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.760 
something it's the lowest point in our
system<00:00:38.720> a<00:00:39.640> pump<00:00:40.640> in<00:00:40.910> there<00:00:41.540> pumps<00:00:42.290> water<00:00:42.470> in

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:42.770 
system a pump in there pumps water in

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.550 
system a pump in there pumps water in
two<00:00:42.980> loops<00:00:43.810> water<00:00:44.810> goes<00:00:45.020> through<00:00:45.050> the<00:00:45.380> fish

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:45.560 
two loops water goes through the fish

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.790 
two loops water goes through the fish
tank<00:00:45.829> and<00:00:46.100> back<00:00:46.970> into<00:00:47.180> the<00:00:47.300> sump<00:00:47.540> and<00:00:47.800> water

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
tank and back into the sump and water

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.389 
tank and back into the sump and water
goes<00:00:49.660> grow<00:00:50.660> bass<00:00:50.870> filling<00:00:51.590> one<00:00:51.770> grow<00:00:52.010> bed<00:00:52.220> at<00:00:52.340> a

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
goes grow bass filling one grow bed at a

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:54.310 
goes grow bass filling one grow bed at a
time<00:00:52.640> you<00:00:53.300> can<00:00:53.420> see<00:00:53.570> this<00:00:53.690> grow<00:00:53.930> bed<00:00:54.140> is

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
time you can see this grow bed is

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.560 
time you can see this grow bed is
filling<00:00:54.649> right<00:00:54.800> now<00:00:55.000> so<00:00:56.000> these<00:00:56.120> grow<00:00:56.360> beds

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
filling right now so these grow beds

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.630 
filling right now so these grow beds
flood<00:00:56.930> and<00:00:57.140> drain<00:00:57.380> back<00:00:57.800> into<00:00:58.040> the<00:00:58.130> sump<00:00:58.399> and

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
flood and drain back into the sump and

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.910 
flood and drain back into the sump and
then<00:00:59.270> the<00:00:59.360> water<00:00:59.540> gets<00:00:59.809> just<00:01:00.620> pumped

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
then the water gets just pumped

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.760 
then the water gets just pumped
continuously<00:01:01.370> in<00:01:01.520> these<00:01:01.640> two<00:01:01.850> loops<00:01:02.649> and<00:01:03.649> all

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:03.770 
continuously in these two loops and all

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.859 
continuously in these two loops and all
the<00:01:03.980> bacteria<00:01:04.129> in<00:01:04.759> the<00:01:05.210> grow<00:01:05.359> beds<00:01:05.600> are

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
the bacteria in the grow beds are

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:08.309 
the bacteria in the grow beds are
breaking<00:01:06.649> down<00:01:06.679> the<00:01:06.979> fish<00:01:07.189> waste<00:01:07.399> into

00:01:08.309 --> 00:01:08.319 
breaking down the fish waste into

00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:10.239 
breaking down the fish waste into
nutrients<00:01:09.319> that<00:01:09.499> can<00:01:09.560> be<00:01:09.740> absorbed<00:01:10.009> by<00:01:10.219> the

00:01:10.239 --> 00:01:10.249 
nutrients that can be absorbed by the

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:14.859 
nutrients that can be absorbed by the
plants<00:01:10.369> and<00:01:12.969> by<00:01:13.969> the<00:01:14.030> point<00:01:14.329> with<00:01:14.479> the<00:01:14.569> plants

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
plants and by the point with the plants

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:17.230 
plants and by the point with the plants
taking<00:01:15.170> up<00:01:15.259> all<00:01:15.350> the<00:01:15.409> nutrient<00:01:15.889> it<00:01:16.119> keeps<00:01:17.119> the

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
taking up all the nutrient it keeps the

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.580 
taking up all the nutrient it keeps the
water<00:01:17.329> nice<00:01:17.630> and<00:01:17.780> clean<00:01:17.929> for<00:01:17.959> the<00:01:18.200> fish

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.610 

we've<00:01:21.189> got

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:23.620 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.920 

I<00:01:23.740> think<00:01:24.400> about<00:01:24.520> a<00:01:24.910> dozen<00:01:25.270> different<00:01:25.450> crops

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
I think about a dozen different crops

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.440 
I think about a dozen different crops
growing<00:01:26.260> in<00:01:26.500> our<00:01:26.560> system<00:01:26.950> we've<00:01:27.640> got<00:01:27.760> bok<00:01:28.060> choy

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
growing in our system we've got bok choy

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.420 
growing in our system we've got bok choy
and<00:01:28.750> die<00:01:29.820> broccoli<00:01:31.020> lettuces<00:01:32.020> and<00:01:32.260> Bill<00:01:32.890> and

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
and die broccoli lettuces and Bill and

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:41.250
