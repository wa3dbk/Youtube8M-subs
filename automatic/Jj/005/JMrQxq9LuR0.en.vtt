00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.520

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.470

 he thought of a way to marketer his 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.539
 product so they thought of having a 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.550
 character so that the public can 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.620

 as in ibarra parodies or when 

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:15.239
 annoy the Japanese and Chinese in real 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.730
 it's just a myth they do not even 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:20.010
 pronounce the l unless it's a 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.359
 English word since it is mandatory 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.939
 that they learn that language 

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:26.040
 according to animes x of koz koz or as I say 

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:28.109
 I know the incestuous twins without 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.959
 offend with incest but it's true 

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:33.359
 If you do not believe me, let me know and I'll 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.849
 several videos insinuating incest x of 

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:38.129
 costco the vocaloid twins them 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:40.349
 they left after miku remarkably 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:42.689
 by the arm of rim that says second xd 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:45.000
 and in the demiku first but that's another 

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:48.569
 topic to see what I can tell you about 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.849
 they mm are 14 years old they always go 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:52.919
 together everywhere 3 I wonder how 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:56.519
 they will do it to go to the bathroom although I think that 

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:58.829
 go together 0 0 and well some data 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:01.829
 en maybe it 's the same with rim 0 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:05.099
 0 me of 153 cms 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:08.489
 despite 47 kgs it is favored to sing 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:11.370
 the dance 00 rock pop modern ballads 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:15.870
 Japanese 00 the time favored for 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:18.150
 use this 70 160 bpm that's that no idea 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.069
 xd me with luck I know that it says to sounds to 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.980
 moan xd and 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:26.040
 specialized voice range meters 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:29.090
 three of five by god who knows that x 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:32.670
 of the first vowel today female doctor 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.799
 w she is the number 00 and recently 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.500
 I discovered his last name but then what 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:39.480
 I forgot XD I do not have much information 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.150
 she apart from having the same age 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.889
 from miku that is 16 but his voice is much 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.129
 more mature or maybe that of miku more 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:49.439
 squeaky of the normal xd and several times 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:52.409
 I've seen it with sake and in other 

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:54.840
 hitting has fallen talking decayed xd 

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:57.030
 have fallen is the first vocaloid 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.540
 male and the truth apart from my 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:02.400
 flattery I know almost nothing about him x from am 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.469
 supposed to be 20 years old so in 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.379
 any match if it's already today 

00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:09.659
 would Sota and if normal would be read x 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:12.299
 d because most vowel two are 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:14.819
 minors but do not know the age of 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:17.130
 some but so I guess x from am 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:19.349
 I also think that in the program when 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.750
 it gets a very sharp tone it comes out like 

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:23.849
 woman's voice xd but when the 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.800
 vowel ring today on allen was fixed 

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:26.550
 that so it would continue to sound like 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.009
 man 3 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:31.550
 to sing opera but we are with that 

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:34.670
 they do not read so 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:38.240
 I think he likes ice cream from xddddd 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:41.390
 and well that is from the x of epoch very this 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.520
 vocaloid am although I do not know much about the 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:46.430
 yes I know that his name and his many about 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:49.100
 names are from ga q plays very home sushi 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:51.020
 and it is also called and it is even the 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:53.360
 name with which I have seen him most 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:56.000
 point for the wrong word 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:59.270
 and it looks like samurai is not that what 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.520
 say for dancing samurai or xdddd and only 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:04.520
 that I know about the other one that he walks with 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:08.120
 a fan x of the new vocaloid 03 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:10.340
 luca marin or I do not know much about her but if 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:13.490
 I can tell you that he sings very cute and 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:15.860
 He's good at English and I do not know anything else about 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:18.080
 she since it came out recently 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.090
 or at least I have not been very attentive xd 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.160
 but these are some of several 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:26.020
 versions that have come out good comment 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.020
