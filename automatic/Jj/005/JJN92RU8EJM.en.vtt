actually decrease the production of

like gluten and possibly casein they

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.529 
like gluten and possibly casein they
also<00:02:07.680> showed<00:02:08.099> that<00:02:08.129> that<00:02:08.729> proteins<00:02:09.270> that<00:02:09.390> were

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
also showed that that proteins that were

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.150 
also showed that that proteins that were
once<00:02:09.780> able<00:02:10.200> to<00:02:10.560> be<00:02:10.709> died

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
once able to be died

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.180 
once able to be died
like<00:02:11.790> Oh<00:02:12.000> gluten<00:02:12.540> has<00:02:13.380> been<00:02:13.590> shown<00:02:13.830> to<00:02:14.010> that

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
like Oh gluten has been shown to that

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.340 
like Oh gluten has been shown to that
the<00:02:14.280> body<00:02:14.490> now<00:02:14.790> as<00:02:15.030> a<00:02:15.060> result<00:02:15.300> of<00:02:15.600> these<00:02:15.780> toxins

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
the body now as a result of these toxins

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.310 
the body now as a result of these toxins
actually<00:02:17.220> creates<00:02:17.880> a<00:02:18.000> immune<00:02:18.630> response

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
actually creates a immune response

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.980 
actually creates a immune response
against<00:02:20.010> these<00:02:20.190> once<00:02:20.550> digestible<00:02:21.450> proteins

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
against these once digestible proteins

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.050 
against these once digestible proteins
so<00:02:22.560> there's<00:02:22.710> a<00:02:22.770> lot<00:02:23.130> of<00:02:23.160> research<00:02:23.820> here

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
so there's a lot of research here

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.090 
so there's a lot of research here
