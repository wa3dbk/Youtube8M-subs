00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
but um but I recommend you to use that

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.059 
but um but I recommend you to use that
single<00:01:33.209> shotgun<00:01:33.450> that<00:01:34.139> you<00:01:34.319> get<00:01:34.469> after<00:01:34.679> this

00:01:35.059 --> 00:01:35.069 
single shotgun that you get after this

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:38.989 
single shotgun that you get after this
gun<00:01:35.389> because<00:01:36.389> it<00:01:37.289> just<00:01:37.469> it<00:01:38.369> just<00:01:38.429> doesn't<00:01:38.909> work

00:01:38.989 --> 00:01:38.999 
gun because it just it just doesn't work

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:41.840 
gun because it just it just doesn't work
as<00:01:39.359> good<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.899> it<00:01:40.770> takes<00:01:41.039> about<00:01:41.219> up<00:01:41.459> to<00:01:41.670> like

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
as good and it takes about up to like

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.080 
as good and it takes about up to like
four<00:01:42.299> or<00:01:42.630> five<00:01:42.659> shots<00:01:43.109> I<00:01:43.729> think<00:01:44.729> I<00:01:44.819> had<00:01:44.939> to
