00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 
things college football at least I don't

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:53.260 
things college football at least I don't
like<00:04:52.100> college<00:04:52.370> basketball<00:04:52.850> I<00:04:52.880> think<00:04:53.090> college

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
like college basketball I think college

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:54.550 
like college basketball I think college
basketball<00:04:53.720> is<00:04:53.780> pretty<00:04:54.110> bad<00:04:54.320> the

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
basketball is pretty bad the

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.070 
basketball is pretty bad the
competition's<00:04:55.100> bad<00:04:55.310> as<00:04:55.490> well<00:04:55.700> and<00:04:56.030> I<00:04:56.180> think<00:04:56.780> I

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
competition's bad as well and I think I

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.630 
competition's bad as well and I think I
think<00:04:57.110> if<00:04:57.380> the<00:04:57.860> players<00:04:58.070> had<00:04:58.310> to<00:04:58.400> stay<00:04:58.580> two

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:58.640 
think if the players had to stay two

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.070 
think if the players had to stay two
years<00:04:59.060> I<00:04:59.180> think<00:04:59.360> it<00:04:59.420> would<00:04:59.510> be<00:04:59.660> a<00:04:59.690> lot<00:04:59.900> better

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
years I think it would be a lot better

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.950 
years I think it would be a lot better
and<00:05:00.880> any<00:05:01.880> people<00:05:02.090> like<00:05:02.270> people<00:05:02.690> that<00:05:02.780> grew<00:05:02.900> up

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
and any people like people that grew up

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.480 
and any people like people that grew up
to<00:05:03.080> say<00:05:03.200> well<00:05:03.440> you<00:05:03.740> should<00:05:03.950> be<00:05:04.040> able<00:05:04.130> to<00:05:04.280> play

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
to say well you should be able to play

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.700 
to say well you should be able to play
at<00:05:04.580> 18<00:05:04.940> listen<00:05:05.870> like<00:05:06.110> a<00:05:06.140> company<00:05:06.530> that

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
at 18 listen like a company that

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.260

you know and I think it'll be better for
the<00:05:22.010> NBA<00:05:22.220> if<00:05:22.400> the<00:05:22.490> players<00:05:22.700> didn't<00:05:22.940> come<00:05:23.060> out

system I think for teams is great I

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:26.760 
system I think for teams is great I
think<00:07:25.090> six<00:07:25.570> would<00:07:25.750> be<00:07:25.870> good<00:07:26.080> to<00:07:26.290> maybe<00:07:26.500> two

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:26.770 
think six would be good to maybe two

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:35.310 
than eight I think would be just way too
much<00:07:32.560> but<00:07:33.390> but<00:07:34.390> four<00:07:34.600> is<00:07:34.630> a<00:07:34.750> good<00:07:34.840> start<00:07:35.200> I'm
