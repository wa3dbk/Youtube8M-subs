00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.270
 hello and welcome to the 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.360
 Next follow Schwager's barbecue 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:23.939
 today, there is something really right 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:26.400
 Delicious that is one third of the 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.019
 all as we did what 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.660
 we need you for that now in the 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.250
 new episode a lot of fun 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.440
 Let us now come to the preparation of 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.120
 the three complete that is conceivable 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:42.059
 just as you can see, the meat has 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:44.309
 a relatively discreet blanket and a 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:48.000
 beautiful marbling look at that 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.530
 great about really really fed the lid 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.989
 that would be me now but once 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.760
 have cut away the pork 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.170
 about two hours ago 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.150
 So fridge is taken right 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.939
 well tempered and wanting too much fat 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:06.990
 we do not have it with us 

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:09.740
 that's what we mean here now good 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.740
 cut off pieces 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.740
 We would not throw that away because 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.720
 that's an exquisite fit that will be 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:22.140
 In the next videos in BÃ¶rger Pettys 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:24.660
 let's have a look and we'll look at that 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:29.250
 remaining parts will be added now 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:32.210
 once again just cut so deep that 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:36.080
 it can bloat on the grill after it 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.080
 and do not go to hell 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:48.410
 and in addition we will be there now 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:48.410
 again cut in length 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:54.810
 better guided by it like butter 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.120
 perfect and it can be like that afterwards 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:01.110
 to rise wonderfully 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:03.290
 wonderful and then we take us 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.910
 nice salt 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.520
 and then could also be quiet generous 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:11.990
 Be the everything also tolerates a 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:13.130
 that little bit of massage 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.820
 Do not fade away 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:19.690
 as the message I already stay up 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.690
 really nice in the crevices purely 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.090
 on the other side, of course, too 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.060
 and that should already have been 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.260
 What your father can see on the grill 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:41.650
 are the great race that is one 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:44.140
 special rust tower with the one loud 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.540
 wonderful brandings to the manufacturer 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.690
 Grillgut can conjure 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.989
 There is still this grill tongs 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:55.690
 and with this barbecue tongs you get completely 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:03:00.010
 between these joints and yes we have 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:01.540
 us thereby beautiful brandings the meat 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.610
 should not dry out and what if 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.709
 Try it now with the lonely one 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.750
 the higher spheres before the first 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.310
 to use them slightly oiled 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.140
 Now about for ten minutes at 15 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.690
 temperature brought and now it is 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.510
 time and in three matches chop 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:24.120
 to apply now we lay together 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:24.120
 the cockpit on so must the climate 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.690
 we're leaving that from every page 90 right now 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:32.020
 seconds on the rost then we turn it 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:34.630
 but it changes the position now 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:35.110
 90 seconds , we have the thing synonymous times 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.640
 turn 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.860
 We will do it by 90 degrees and one 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.140
 to create a beautiful pattern 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:45.150
 and then the blanket does not come for the 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.150
 next few seconds again on it 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.010
 another 19 seconds are over 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:55.330
 we are looking forward to the result 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:58.000
 if so just now 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:00.730
 beautiful pattern exactly what we 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.040
 want to have and it works for the 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:09.100
 next 90 seconds back under the 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:13.360
 cover another 90 seconds syndrome and 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.840
 We will be 90 degrees and down 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.060
 for this 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.030
 We take the baby in the now 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:21.250
 indirect gift raich push the whole 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:24.550
 A bit away the green gays 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:28.140
 out and bring the whole on one 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.140
 core temperature of 53 degrees 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.669
 of course we have the feather lids 

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:34.470
 We are planning to forget about the clubs 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:38.009
 also a little unobtrusive 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:41.849
 a here and then he can in the 

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:44.729
 Indirect area would be one now 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:47.880
 core temperature of 41 degrees 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:49.860
 are reached 53 degrees 42 takes so long 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:54.740
 still about 10 15 minutes to the finished 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:56.910
 result from you to it it is so far 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.979
 the way resp 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:04.340
 the thermometer spins we have the 53 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:07.500
 We were able to reach by degrees 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:10.819
 but now we want this wonderful 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.819
 cut pieces of meat and 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:17.560
 Aha 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:23.440
 right track from the better headed 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.440
 through like butter 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.910
 really good 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.410
 the water is on the meat that is 

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:35.770
 just fantastic 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:38.800
 I'm already looking forward to trying it out 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:43.930
 this is the result of dear people 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:47.300
 really really delicious piece or all 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:48.110
 That's the way it says we have to go now 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:52.690
 just try it 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:52.690
 I 'm really looking forward to it 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.050
 in this sense 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.419
 they offer 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:08.080
 it's mother I was really good 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:15.730
