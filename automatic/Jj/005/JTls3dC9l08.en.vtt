two Black Keys in the middle of your

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.540 
two Black Keys in the middle of your
keyboard<00:00:36.600> you<00:00:37.500> notice<00:00:37.770> there's<00:00:37.980> other<00:00:38.190> C's

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
keyboard you notice there's other C's

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.900 
keyboard you notice there's other C's
around<00:00:38.969> see<00:00:39.239> these<00:00:39.420> two<00:00:39.690> black<00:00:40.140> keys<00:00:40.379> here

around see these two black keys here

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.410 
around see these two black keys here
here's<00:00:41.910> a<00:00:41.969> C<00:00:43.070> here's<00:00:44.070> another<00:00:44.430> C<00:00:44.789> but<00:00:45.059> we<00:00:45.180> want

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
here's a C here's another C but we want

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.180 
here's a C here's another C but we want
to<00:00:45.480> get<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.930> center<00:00:46.289> of<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.530> keyboard<00:00:46.950> if

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
to get to the center of the keyboard if

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.400 
to get to the center of the keyboard if
you're<00:00:48.090> on<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.239> piano<00:00:48.539> it<00:00:48.899> makes<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.289> little

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
you're on a piano it makes it a little

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.430 
you're on a piano it makes it a little
easier<00:00:49.860> because<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.399> name<00:00:50.700> of<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.059> piano

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
easier because the name of the piano

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.290 
easier because the name of the piano
will<00:00:52.440> be<00:00:52.590> right<00:00:52.860> in<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.219> center<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.820> piano

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
will be right in the center of the piano

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.380 
will be right in the center of the piano
and<00:00:54.500> so<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:55.559> will<00:00:56.010> look<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.489> left<00:00:56.789> of<00:00:57.149> the

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
and so you will look to the left of the

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.479 
and so you will look to the left of the
name<00:00:57.629> of<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.930> piano<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.590> that<00:00:59.039> will<00:00:59.250> be<00:00:59.370> your

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
name of the piano and that will be your

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.189 
name of the piano and that will be your
middle<00:00:59.789> C<00:01:00.000> so<00:01:00.030> that's<00:01:00.329> sort<00:01:00.539> of<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.750> starting

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
middle C so that's sort of a starting

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.830 
middle C so that's sort of a starting
point<00:01:01.379> in<00:01:01.559> Arc's<00:01:01.800> axiom<00:01:02.309> for<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:02.670> there<00:01:02.879> so

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
point in Arc's axiom for you there so

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.780 
point in Arc's axiom for you there so
now<00:01:04.019> that<00:01:04.080> we<00:01:04.229> found<00:01:04.439> C<00:01:04.890> we<00:01:05.100> need<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.400> build<00:01:05.549> our

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
now that we found C we need to build our

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.310 
now that we found C we need to build our
course<00:01:06.500> every<00:01:07.500> chord<00:01:07.860> is<00:01:08.100> built<00:01:08.400> off<00:01:08.640> of<00:01:08.820> one

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
course every chord is built off of one

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.710 
course every chord is built off of one
three<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.560> five<00:01:10.979> we<00:01:11.490> have<00:01:11.640> our<00:01:11.760> triad<00:01:12.330> which

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
three and five we have our triad which

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.679 
three and five we have our triad which
is<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.049> one<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.500> three<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.180> that<00:01:15.180> would<00:01:15.270> be<00:01:15.390> C

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
is the one to three and that would be C

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.240 
is the one to three and that would be C
D<00:01:16.229> E<00:01:16.530> C<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.610> e<00:01:17.640> one<00:01:18.210> two<00:01:18.540> three<00:01:18.869> C<00:01:19.229> being<00:01:19.470> one<00:01:19.740> D

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
D E C to e one two three C being one D

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.120 
D E C to e one two three C being one D
being<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.790> be<00:01:21.030> being<00:01:21.479> three<00:01:21.780> so<00:01:22.380> CTE<00:01:22.799> is<00:01:23.009> our

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
being to be being three so CTE is our

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.460 
being to be being three so CTE is our
triad<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.820> then<00:01:24.479> we<00:01:24.570> need<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.840> add<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.200> fifth

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
triad and then we need to add the fifth

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.920 
triad and then we need to add the fifth
of<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.770> chord<00:01:26.040> c<00:01:26.520> d<00:01:26.880> e<00:01:27.090> f<00:01:27.570> g<00:01:28.340> c<00:01:29.340> e<00:01:29.369> g<00:01:29.640> is<00:01:30.420> our

because that will be the fourth and we

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.870 
because that will be the fourth and we
need<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:56.969> fifth<00:01:57.240> here's<00:01:58.200> our<00:01:58.409> one<00:01:58.710> three<00:01:59.310> five

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.830 

now<00:02:09.570> to<00:02:10.440> make<00:02:10.590> a<00:02:10.650> chord<00:02:11.070> minor<00:02:11.490> all<00:02:12.090> you<00:02:12.630> have

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
now to make a chord minor all you have

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.950 
now to make a chord minor all you have
to<00:02:13.020> do<00:02:13.230> is<00:02:13.680> lower<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.490> third<00:02:14.820> in<00:02:15.060> this<00:02:15.420> case<00:02:15.690> by

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
to do is lower the third in this case by

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.920 
to do is lower the third in this case by
a<00:02:15.990> half<00:02:16.290> step<00:02:16.680> so<00:02:16.920> if<00:02:17.370> we<00:02:17.550> currently<00:02:17.880> have<00:02:18.330> C<00:02:18.750> E

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
a half step so if we currently have C E

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.670 
a half step so if we currently have C E
and<00:02:19.380> G<00:02:19.940> the<00:02:20.940> third<00:02:21.210> would<00:02:21.450> be<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.720> e<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:22.410> third

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
and G the third would be the e the third

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.280 
and G the third would be the e the third
would<00:02:22.890> be<00:02:23.010> the<00:02:23.160> third<00:02:23.460> finger<00:02:24.090> and<00:02:24.300> the<00:02:24.990> third

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
would be the third finger and the third

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.560 
would be the third finger and the third
