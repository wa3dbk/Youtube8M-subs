00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 soak for the procedure before 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.089
 hydrophilic pads in water or nat 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.990
 The solution is applied on them designated 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.389
 attending doctor 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.190
 drug then go on 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.860
 directly to our device and 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:17.160
 we attach to it electrodes observing 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.199
 polarity we attach an electrode 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.029
 red only wire device with 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.050
 using a crocodile clip 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:26.689
 connect the red wire only 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:30.590
 Related to E socket with a sign 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:32.540
 plus electrode which is now acquired 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.309
 positive polarity we invest 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.050
 hydrophilic gasket which 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:39.730
 will subsequently be attached to 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.730
 sore spot on the patient's body 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.810
 we also do that with another electrode 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.640
 connect it to the black wire only 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.950
 after which the resulting electrode 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.260
 negative polarity send to non 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.720
 100 with a minus sign the next stage 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.420
 connect the device to the network and click 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.100
 on the power button network when 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.260
 power on automatically 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.040
 becomes range from 0 to five 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.080
 milliampere 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.150
 the corresponding indicator will light up 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:08.479
 the range where zero is displayed 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.880
 the value of the device is ready to work in 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:13.340
 whichever patient is 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.240
 child or adults choose a range 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.850
 operation mode 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:20.450
 children from zero to five milliamps or 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.940
 adult from me to 50 milliamps after 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.170
 adjustable due to current note that 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.750
 every turn 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.160
 regulator feels tactile and 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.590
 accompanied by a short 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.140
 sound signal rotation of the handle 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:36.860
 clockwise increases the amperage a 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.810
 counter clockwise decreases with 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:43.250
 using the timer button set the time 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:45.440
 performing the procedure 10 15 20 25 or 30 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.360
 minutes after the set 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.450
 performing temporal interval 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.580
 procedures are terminated automatically 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.709
 if the time interval is not defined then 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.509
 the procedure will take place without 

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:59.979
 time constraints because here 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:59.979
 need control from a pirate
