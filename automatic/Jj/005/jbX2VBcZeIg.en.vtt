00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.279
 a two-ton luxury limousine 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.350
 from Zuffenhausen with one 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.590
 Average consumption of a small car 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.780
 the porsche panamera s hybrid should be exactly 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.210
 to do that 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:19.490
 it supports a 70 kw electric motor 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.750
 the 333 ps v6 burner where he can 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:28.140
 short distances are even pure 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:32.189
 electrically possible system performance 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.079
 of the luxury liner 416 ps porsche 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.760
 promises a consumption of just 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:42.120
 once 3.1 liters per 100 kilometers 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:44.870
 topspeed 270 km h the basic price for the 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.230
 fastest series hybrids in the world 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.340
 110,400 9 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.590
 we are sitting here in a porsche 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.090
 Panamera and it is unusual we are 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.860
 the only one who can hear the engine 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.809
 housing that we are just listening to 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.460
 a little bit of rolling noise from the tires 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.980
 otherwise silent 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.960
 we drive purely electric and 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.530
 that's the special thing about it 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.530
 panamera 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:11.520
 although we are really steep here 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.490
 mountain high frank schaff the panamera 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.530
 still have 70 kw purely electric 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.040
 We perform when you are purely electric 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.860
 drive 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.610
 at least we could do with it at the same level 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.439
 Drive 135 km h so I think 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.200
 pretty impressive about this serious 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.420
 to move cars 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.400
 after all, up to 36 kilometers far 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.299
 makes it that Porsche flagship pure 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:39.540
 we are electrically straight with the 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:42.540
 internal combustion engine then drives 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:46.670
 the panamera a v6 at the original 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:49.200
 it comes from audi a v6 with compressor 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:52.080
 I would not exactly say that he did 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.659
 the panamera really wm in forward 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.119
 but drives the power of 333 ps 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.930
 is definitely enough to get on the way 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.030
 to be 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.369
 Of course, it's really great 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.320
 only when electric motor and 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.720
 Push combustion engine together 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.670
 then it's on the highway so 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.250
 really almost in the league of that 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.010
 supercars that's right 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.220
 forward to the driving behavior you notice that 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:20.819
 hybrid panamera is something to weight on 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.590
 the whole battery whole technology that lies 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.750
 natural and weight pushes 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.060
 agility also we are here 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.819
 special tire on the way 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.489
 and that also costs a bit of grip anyway 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:36.500
 this still amazing how agile 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.500
 The big dare goes around the bend 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.000
 The freestyler several are available from about 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.580
 110000 euros 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.950
 that's a lot of money, of course, but for that 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.840
 There is the best hybrid of its class 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.770
 because in the luxury class, nobody can 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.770
 better than postage
