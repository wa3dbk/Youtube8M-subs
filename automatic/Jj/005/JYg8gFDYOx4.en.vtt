00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.940
 hello to all my readers, good afternoon and welcome back to ours 

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.630
 usual appointment with collatina 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.860
 forgive the seriousness but today is a special day for a day 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.469
 of mourning if we want 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:14.569
 the levi law comes into force 

00:00:14.569 --> 00:00:16.660
 1st September 2011 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:22.000
 a date to remember to write personal notebooks because it will mark one 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.390
 a turning point for all of us readers and not just a breakthrough in souls with creative character 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.499
 now I'll explain why 

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:33.800
 I explain what my motivations are first of all what 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.350
 provides for the law Levi Langerie was officially approved on July 20 of 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.199
 this year after two years of heated debates and takes its name from the first one 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:43.160
 signatory 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.260
 sets a ceiling of 15% discount for anything on books 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.020
 all creditors will be subjected to this obligation sexes of turin 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.580
 also list online with me amas on board ibs university library etc. 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.110
 etc. only ebooks that do not have the limit in this sense 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.619
 the natural therefore think of a strategy are thin traits 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.900
 to encourage the entry of digital painting at the expense of paper reading 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.000
 who supports the initiative 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.750
 small publishers private bookstores raise the alarm instead of librarians 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.160
 protest readers because and librarians why they buy i 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.080
 volumes. the texts from the publishers directly or damage to the themes 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.149
 current or customary of physical 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:32.570
 at favorable prices when it is convenient details 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.660
 now they can't do it anymore 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.950
 this means that they will gradually stop being refugees and research sources 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:39.720
 safety 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.130
 because it had risen to attend them is therefore preferred to save on the costs 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.760
 exorbitant of the latest book releases 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.280
 publication texts 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.090
 how much does it matter to the Italian state to really defend 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.200
 the right 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.200
 has a free public reading the municipality 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.630
 that they stopped giving us advertising campaigns on value 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.329
 in culture a richness contained in a book and because lictors do not like it 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.560
 being teased I am very embittered and angry because 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.850
 trying to do some calculations did not erode the future that awaits us 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.399
 I wish I could suggest a counter-offensive attack to restore 

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:25.059
 the situation and probably there would also be a dot to buy more books but 

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:27.809
 it would be better if I gathered together 

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:29.229
 hyenas 

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:31.330
 and if everyone proposes to be 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:32.840
 a battle plan 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.739
 if you shouldn't want to, then at least I can claim to have 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:37.590
 said mine 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.569
 and not being silent 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:44.460
 everything cannot go well, we are not subjects but citizens 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.830
 and as such we have childhood and i ride to indicate something that belongs to us 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.830
 what is taken away from us is not a prerogative 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.449
 it is not a requirement it is not a virtue of the few 

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:57.509
 reading is good 

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:58.809
 and all 

00:02:58.809 --> 00:03:00.479
 must be able to use
