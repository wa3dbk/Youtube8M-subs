orange and you squeezed the peel that
juice<00:00:31.590> that<00:00:31.619> comes<00:00:31.980> out<00:00:32.130> is<00:00:32.250> very<00:00:32.430> flammable

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
juice that comes out is very flammable

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.299 
juice that comes out is very flammable
and<00:00:33.570> that's<00:00:33.870> what<00:00:34.050> we<00:00:34.170> use<00:00:34.350> in<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.800> engine<00:00:35.190> to

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
and that's what we use in the engine to

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.889 
and that's what we use in the engine to
run<00:00:35.460> it<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:35.760> then<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.090> whole<00:00:36.329> place<00:00:36.630> smells

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
run it and then the whole place smells

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.560 
run it and then the whole place smells
like<00:00:37.020> orange<00:00:37.440> juice<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:38.460> cyclone<00:00:38.940> clean-air

year not just in fuel but in repairs

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.149 
year not just in fuel but in repairs
that's<00:01:09.270> because<00:01:09.659> this<00:01:09.930> engine<00:01:10.409> is<00:01:10.560> much<00:01:10.890> more

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
that's because this engine is much more

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.340 
that's because this engine is much more
