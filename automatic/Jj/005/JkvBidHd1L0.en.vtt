00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:10.480
 hello my love welcome to my 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:11.950
 next video 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.889
 Today will be here again from the 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.390
 do residues live like before that, 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:18.310
 a lot to look like we have the leftovers 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.529
 We would throw it away too 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:24.039
 a bit dry private life because of me 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:25.990
 also a lot for you experiment and yes 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:29.289
 we will prepare clips 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:31.269
 Let's start with the cake pops 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:32.920
 will prepare me like me am 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:35.559
 already mentioned at the beginning of the video 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.360
 use impact-cream and that is the 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:39.820
 most of kreml threatened for me 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.739
 food coloring this is a finished one 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.030
 mix it with milk to one 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:47.129
 cream suggests you get it 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:52.180
 example, real estate and so on and 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:55.660
 pie crust leftovers use this rest 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:58.629
 I have those crumbles now 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.129
 no tottenham rests and beatings 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:01.809
 you can have over normal 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.030
 to prepare the cake 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:05.590
 and if you want to know how it works 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.030
 then just look under my videos 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.240
 the way the the instructions too 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.590
 find and then the impact force you after 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.399
 their instructions, it is also the 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.780
 packaging to prepare a cream 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:18.720
 so that our rear stay clean 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.280
 we can put on gloves 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.200
 so that the cake pops are not too hard or 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.300
 do not be too soft we take on 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:29.259
 best part of the pie crust 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:31.349
 Remains gradually came to me rest 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:33.759
 Add 

00:01:31.349 --> 00:01:35.590
 so that the whole thing can be crispy 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:39.539
 we still butter biscuits and add 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.539
 We chop them by hand 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.810
 next we know the whipped cream 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.470
 Add the whole thing to a dough 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.470
 knead 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:13.010
 should not live too much cake soil 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:15.540
 otherwise the whole thing would crumble apart 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.190
 We can rest for longer weeks 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.750
 kept refrigerated 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.900
 you can follow her afterwards 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.360
 use 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.069
 after the dough is finished kneaded 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.780
 namely a butter biscuit and cut the 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:28.780
 in four equal parts 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.590
 Now we start with little balls 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.590
 to form the dough 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.700
 besides that butter 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.010
 pieces have cut and right 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.270
 move back in the station than below 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.270
 the middle a bit inside 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.760
 and repeat the same predecessors 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.439
 some of them leave as they are 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.120
 need to work on before we what 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.980
 a bit hard for that 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.230
 you in the fridge of at least one 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:29.380
 hour or if it should go fast 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:31.830
 you can make device-range yet 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.140
 ten to fifteen minutes 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:37.110
 while the balls cool we put 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:40.490
 a cake klausur into the water bath for 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.490
 at least ten minutes 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:48.320
 next we stick woodpicks in 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.320
 an office Porr piece one 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.510
 In addition, we need small colorful 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:04:03.459
 smarties blue decor sugar that have 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:05.200
 I from edeka in her letters or in 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:11.909
 also share the kickbox when wanted 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:11.909
 magazine colorful sugar sprinkles 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:17.430
 and finally many butter cookies again 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:20.410
 divided by four 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:23.820
 after the balls have hardened 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:28.210
 in the fridge next to me a wooden skewer 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:35.470
 and take a sting the 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:39.090
 wood skewer into the picture and dive 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.090
 put it in the cake for such a 

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:48.139
 because the ball dries so fast 

00:04:45.309 --> 00:04:54.099
 give me the butter biscuits quickly in the 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:57.499
 mouth in so push it in and out 

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:59.889
 The upper area raged in the decor 

00:04:57.499 --> 00:04:59.889
 sugar 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:21.020
 and finally the two smarties 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:24.729
 for the eyes stinging the wooden skewer 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.729
 back into the office couple of pieces 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:32.499
 we do that and the same process 

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:32.499
 with the people who also have mouth 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.500
 those who have no mouth 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:45.830
 We were allowed to sprinkle in the sugar 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.830
 in 

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:15.360
 After the ball glaze dried 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:19.770
 Can we use sugar font letters 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:23.630
 decorate it as for example the 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:23.630
 Names of a birthday boy 

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:37.420
 to present the cake pops a lot 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:39.900
 Can we do that with the report piece 

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:42.580
 wrapped in a gift wrap 

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:44.470
 Now we can return the cake pops here 

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:47.770
 plug into the play 

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:49.570
 so are the cake pops i hope it has 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:51.340

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:57.510
 Cooked and then read to taste
