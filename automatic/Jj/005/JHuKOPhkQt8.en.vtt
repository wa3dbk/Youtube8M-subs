00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.089 
things
lip<00:00:27.029> balm<00:00:27.269> will<00:00:27.539> definitely<00:00:28.170> be<00:00:28.380> on<00:00:28.590> that<00:00:28.830> list

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
lip balm will definitely be on that list

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.299 
lip balm will definitely be on that list
how<00:00:29.789> I<00:00:29.820> feel<00:00:30.179> about<00:00:30.330> these<00:00:30.779> AOS<00:00:31.439> lip<00:00:31.679> balms<00:00:31.920> are

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
how I feel about these AOS lip balms are

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.690 
how I feel about these AOS lip balms are
that<00:00:32.610> they<00:00:32.910> are<00:00:33.090> okay<00:00:33.960> but<00:00:34.590> perhaps<00:00:35.040> leaning

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
that they are okay but perhaps leaning

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.479 
that they are okay but perhaps leaning
more<00:00:35.880> towards<00:00:36.300> like<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:37.260> better<00:00:37.500> end<00:00:37.829> of<00:00:38.190> the

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
more towards like the better end of the

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.330 
more towards like the better end of the
spectrum<00:00:39.180> if<00:00:39.989> you<00:00:40.260> are<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.620> type<00:00:40.800> of<00:00:40.860> person

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
spectrum if you are the type of person

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.130 
spectrum if you are the type of person
that<00:00:41.370> prefers<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:41.879> more<00:00:42.059> waxy<00:00:42.660> type<00:00:42.870> of<00:00:42.989> lip

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
that prefers a more waxy type of lip

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.979 
that prefers a more waxy type of lip
balm<00:00:43.379> I<00:00:43.649> do<00:00:43.920> recommend<00:00:44.550> these<00:00:44.850> AOS<00:00:45.450> ones<00:00:45.780> I

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
balm I do recommend these AOS ones I

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.940 
balm I do recommend these AOS ones I
like<00:00:46.320> that<00:00:46.590> it's<00:00:46.770> like<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.309> large<00:00:47.640> round<00:00:48.450> dome

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:48.950 
like that it's like a large round dome

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.410 
like that it's like a large round dome
shape<00:00:49.950> because<00:00:50.280> then<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:50.550> can<00:00:50.730> get<00:00:50.940> both<00:00:51.210> your

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.290 
shape because then you can get both your
lips<00:00:51.660> at<00:00:52.050> once<00:00:52.440> like<00:00:52.710> that<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.280> I<00:00:53.610> think<00:00:54.059> that

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
lips at once like that and I think that

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.299

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
is that it kind of either be greasy so

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.160 
is that it kind of either be greasy so
you<00:01:17.009> can't<00:01:17.310> really<00:01:17.610> put<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:17.909> lip<00:01:18.150> color<00:01:18.390> over<00:01:19.020> it

you can't really put a lip color over it

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.710 
you can't really put a lip color over it
so<00:01:19.590> if<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:20.040> were<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.520> wear<00:01:20.700> like<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.240> bright<00:01:21.479> lip

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
so if you were to wear like a bright lip

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.600 
so if you were to wear like a bright lip
color<00:01:21.960> like<00:01:22.259> I<00:01:22.409> am<00:01:22.590> today<00:01:22.799> like<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:23.400> would

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.490

recommend<00:01:24.060> using<00:01:24.210> something<00:01:24.720> like<00:01:24.840> this<00:01:25.170> as<00:01:25.439> a

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
recommend using something like this as a

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.219 
recommend using something like this as a
lip<00:01:25.770> balm<00:01:25.979> under<00:01:26.460> it<00:01:26.610> just<00:01:26.840> because<00:01:27.840> they

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
lip balm under it just because they

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.010 
lip balm under it just because they
don't<00:01:28.439> have<00:01:28.650> that<00:01:28.890> that<00:01:29.729> greasy<00:01:30.119> slippery

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
don't have that that greasy slippery

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.530 
don't have that that greasy slippery
kind<00:01:31.409> of<00:01:31.560> texture<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:32.280> do<00:01:32.400> find<00:01:32.970> that<00:01:33.119> you<00:01:33.360> need

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
kind of texture I do find that you need

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.410 
kind of texture I do find that you need
to<00:01:33.750> reapply<00:01:34.140> them<00:01:34.560> quite<00:01:34.979> often<00:01:35.280> because<00:01:36.000> they

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
to reapply them quite often because they

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.230 
to reapply them quite often because they
don't<00:01:36.689> have<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.320> overwhelmingly

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
don't have that overwhelmingly

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.999 
don't have that overwhelmingly
moisturizing<00:01:39.240> feel<00:01:39.570> if<00:01:39.990> you're<00:01:40.320> very

rather<00:03:06.139> bulky<00:03:06.469> and<00:03:06.829> cumbersome<00:03:07.340> so<00:03:07.609> I

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:07.639 
rather bulky and cumbersome so I

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:09.339
