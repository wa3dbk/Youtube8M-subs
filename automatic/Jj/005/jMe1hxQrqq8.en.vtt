00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.660
 bra all gt afghan guys are 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.100
 feminine objects and welcome back with 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.450
 clan channel with a new video today 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.070
 I propose to you my world record 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.020
 world's fastest nuclear route 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.520
 without having the active design 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.810
 then guys the gameplay be 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.630
 performed on team deathmatches in 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.340
 only the record however is the general too 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.060
 in group on domain no one ever had 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.829
 done better 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.750
 in fact the boys the previous record 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:32.920
 had been carried out at the station if 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.410
 I'm not mistaken by a Spanish player 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.210
 now I can't remember it was done in 4 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.560
 minutes and thirty I really did a lot 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.059
 searches to find one 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.660
 at least the fastest I found was 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:47.170
 that is precisely it is a core 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:49.840
 in solo with the never active visa that is 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.160
 on the mini map I never got the go 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.660
 It was a really weird game 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.070
 because in practice i was playing for 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.390
 do lots of things about the match 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.579
 I succeeded in this game 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.230
 in fact I'll finish with 60 kiss the gameplay 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.530
 you will probably see another one complete 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.519
 day on my dog skied 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.530
 using a type 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:07.630
 I was also without a jackal and used only 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.490
 not his face because I was level 20 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.350
 and to the first prestige and stupidly me 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.750
 I am brought in on Monday and those ones 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.730
 I didn't have it I used only the web el 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.350
 lightning attack that I was pulling and then 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.850
 maybe the nuclear face would be 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.430
 could also become faster if not 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.990
 had thrown the attack precisely 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.860
 lightning but ok, I decided to do it 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.450
 the same and then guys recapping 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.520
 nuclear in team deathmatches in solo 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.960
 two minutes and 30 without ever having i 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.590
 disabled in the air 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.120
 ie in the map now reiterating of 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.070
 new because in my opinion a concept 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.930
 quite difficult to understand the record 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.520
 it's in general and not just about deathmatch 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.960
 which was then done on deathmatch is 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.630
 a separate story 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.890
 so guys, I really wanted to 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.270
 say with you to express mine with you 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.960
 joy because since when they are 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.970
 returned to the clan 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.320
 I really made absurd gameplay and 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.690
 see the list a little immediately without 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.240
 spoiler too I did four 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.640
 nuclear team deathmatches under the 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.080
 two minutes in solo obviously do me 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.910
 know if you want to see why they are 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.130
 really absurd gameplay especially two 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.909
 I made them without the quick charger and 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.550
 then 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:11.050
 she really fantastic gameplay then 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.550
 really let me know if you would like them 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.900
 see here on the clan channel why me 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.549
 would really like many meanwhile 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.480
 look at some scary feeds that 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:20.739
 I make and pass nothing from the page 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.420
 facebook of the fan you find in 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:26.110
 description now we are lately 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.489
 uploading some I don't know photo zodiac a 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.319
 sometimes loads of his photos then 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.420
 just line a little more active than 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.799
 software because it is really estimated as much 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.660
 mate the damp pass on the page 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:36.580
 facebook that he really is always there 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.590
 very active a lot maybe not though it is 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.000
 really active last thing i got the 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.440
 lucky to find a real opponent 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.329
 quite scarce and in this game 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.129
 but sometimes it always happens 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:45.940
 take advantage of opportunities, however, boys 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:47.739
 now the video has actually been 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.940
 arminio I hope that I feel certain I 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:50.980
 comment if you are not yet
