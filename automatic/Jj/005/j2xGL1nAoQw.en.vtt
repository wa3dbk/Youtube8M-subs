and I am actually gonna go all the way
through<00:03:16.130> the<00:03:16.280> series<00:03:16.489> because<00:03:16.849> the<00:03:16.970> reason<00:03:17.239> I

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
through the series because the reason I

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:19.449 
through the series because the reason I
didn't<00:03:17.569> want<00:03:17.630> to<00:03:17.810> finish<00:03:18.319> the<00:03:18.680> series<00:03:18.889> last

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
didn't want to finish the series last

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.430 
didn't want to finish the series last
time<00:03:19.669> was<00:03:20.480> because<00:03:20.510> a<00:03:20.720> lot<00:03:20.930> of<00:03:21.019> people<00:03:21.319> were

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
time was because a lot of people were

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.199 
time was because a lot of people were
seeing<00:03:21.680> the<00:03:21.799> first<00:03:21.919> episode<00:03:22.430> seeing<00:03:22.970> that<00:03:23.090> it

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
seeing the first episode seeing that it

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:24.220 
seeing the first episode seeing that it
wasn't<00:03:23.660> very<00:03:23.840> good

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
wasn't very good

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.199 
wasn't very good
I'm<00:03:24.380> just<00:03:24.919> not<00:03:25.160> carrying<00:03:25.609> on<00:03:25.790> and<00:03:25.970> watching

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
I'm just not carrying on and watching

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.330 
I'm just not carrying on and watching
the<00:03:26.299> next<00:03:26.419> episodes<00:03:26.900> from<00:03:27.079> there<00:03:27.230> and<00:03:28.220> that

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
the next episodes from there and that

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.629 
the next episodes from there and that
really<00:03:28.639> didn't<00:03:28.880> motivate<00:03:29.239> me<00:03:29.359> to<00:03:29.389> do<00:03:29.599> it<00:03:29.780> so

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:30.639 
really didn't motivate me to do it so

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:32.800 
really didn't motivate me to do it so
what<00:03:31.639> I'm<00:03:31.790> planning<00:03:31.970> is<00:03:32.209> if<00:03:32.359> I<00:03:32.480> can<00:03:32.660> make<00:03:32.780> a

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
what I'm planning is if I can make a

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.750 
what I'm planning is if I can make a
really<00:03:33.139> good<00:03:33.260> first<00:03:33.440> episode<00:03:34.010> and<00:03:34.250> people

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
really good first episode and people

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.490

like<00:03:34.940> it<00:03:34.970> and<00:03:35.359> I<00:03:35.569> can<00:03:35.750> continue<00:03:36.200> that<00:03:36.319> high

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
like it and I can continue that high

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.220 
like it and I can continue that high
quality<00:03:36.560> throughout<00:03:37.160> the<00:03:37.310> rest<00:03:37.549> I<00:03:37.819> will<00:03:38.230> have
