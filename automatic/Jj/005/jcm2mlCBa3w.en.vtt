any<00:01:17.430> water<00:01:17.729> wants<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.299> run<00:01:18.479> off<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:18.990> side

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
any water wants to run off to the side

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.890 
any water wants to run off to the side
it<00:01:20.040> can't<00:01:20.400> now<00:01:20.640> because<00:01:20.970> it'll<00:01:21.150> hit<00:01:21.360> that<00:01:21.570> rock

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
it can't now because it'll hit that rock

it can't now because it'll hit that rock
and<00:01:22.200> kind<00:01:22.350> of<00:01:22.500> Wiese<00:01:22.650> back<00:01:22.890> down<00:01:23.189> into<00:01:23.460> the

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
and kind of Wiese back down into the

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.719 
and kind of Wiese back down into the
pool<00:01:23.840> and<00:01:24.840> chris<00:01:25.049> is<00:01:25.229> just<00:01:25.340> notching<00:01:26.340> that<00:01:26.520> out

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
pool and chris is just notching that out

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.460 
pool and chris is just notching that out
so<00:01:27.030> we<00:01:27.119> get<00:01:27.240> a<00:01:27.299> nice<00:01:27.509> tight<00:01:27.840> fit<00:01:27.869> with<00:01:28.290> that

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.490 
so we get a nice tight fit with that
stone<00:01:28.829> there<00:01:29.450> we're<00:01:30.450> gonna<00:01:30.540> try<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:30.900> set<00:01:31.229> rocks

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
stone there we're gonna try to set rocks

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.789 
stone there we're gonna try to set rocks
all<00:01:31.920> along<00:01:32.340> this<00:01:32.579> whole<00:01:32.790> entire<00:01:33.299> beam<00:01:33.799> work

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
all along this whole entire beam work

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.609 
all along this whole entire beam work
her<00:01:35.009> way<00:01:35.189> out<00:01:35.220> here<00:01:36.049> once<00:01:37.049> we<00:01:37.200> get<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.500> the

this<00:01:39.990> pools<00:01:40.350> pretty<00:01:40.830> much<00:01:41.010> done<00:01:41.510> this<00:01:42.510> is

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
this pools pretty much done this is

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.500 
this pools pretty much done this is
three<00:01:43.080> to<00:01:43.200> four<00:01:43.440> inch<00:01:43.620> thick<00:01:43.950> flagstone<00:01:44.850> all

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:45.510 
three to four inch thick flagstone all

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.450 
three to four inch thick flagstone all
very<00:01:45.870> heavy<00:01:46.110> pieces<00:01:46.440> we<00:01:46.830> had<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.040> set<00:01:47.280> these

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
very heavy pieces we had to set these

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.380 
very heavy pieces we had to set these
into<00:01:47.820> place

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
into place

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.940 
into place
and<00:01:48.720> then<00:01:48.900> when<00:01:49.050> you<00:01:49.140> cut<00:01:49.410> them<00:01:49.620> it's<00:01:49.830> very

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
and then when you cut them it's very

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.400 
and then when you cut them it's very
hard<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.400> cut<00:01:50.670> through<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.330> then<00:01:52.200> we're

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.410 
hard to cut through and then we're

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.219 
hard to cut through and then we're
honing<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.979> edge<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:53.520> give<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:53.670> nice<00:01:53.910> round

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
honing the edge to give a nice round

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.859 
honing the edge to give a nice round
bullnose<00:01:55.229> effect<00:01:55.740> so<00:01:55.890> it's<00:01:56.070> very<00:01:56.190> smooth<00:01:56.869> and

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
net so I had to make sure to cut it out

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.670 
net so I had to make sure to cut it out
for<00:02:17.100> the<00:02:17.220> skimmer<00:02:17.660> lineup<00:02:18.660> drill<00:02:19.470> this<00:02:19.620> hole

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
for the skimmer lineup drill this hole

for the skimmer lineup drill this hole
and<00:02:20.310> you<00:02:20.580> can<00:02:20.730> see<00:02:20.940> it's<00:02:21.120> exactly<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:21.959> right

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
and you can see it's exactly the right

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.010 
and you can see it's exactly the right
size<00:02:22.470> I<00:02:22.980> didn't<00:02:23.459> have<00:02:23.580> any<00:02:23.760> wiggle<00:02:24.030> room<00:02:24.239> if<00:02:24.810> I

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
size I didn't have any wiggle room if I

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.500 
size I didn't have any wiggle room if I
was<00:02:25.230> off<00:02:25.440> even<00:02:25.890> an<00:02:26.010> eighth<00:02:26.130> of<00:02:26.370> an<00:02:26.489> inch<00:02:26.640> then

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
was off even an eighth of an inch then

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.150 
was off even an eighth of an inch then
the<00:02:27.720> hole<00:02:27.959> that<00:02:28.140> I<00:02:28.200> cut<00:02:28.470> out<00:02:28.500> for<00:02:28.800> the<00:02:28.860> skimmer

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
the hole that I cut out for the skimmer

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.479 
the hole that I cut out for the skimmer
wouldn't<00:02:29.640> aligned<00:02:29.880> up<00:02:30.180> but<00:02:30.780> as<00:02:30.870> you<00:02:31.020> can<00:02:31.170> see

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
wouldn't aligned up but as you can see

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.430 
wouldn't aligned up but as you can see
everything<00:02:32.489> came<00:02:32.730> out<00:02:32.760> perfect<00:02:33.480> and<00:02:33.630> here

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
everything came out perfect and here

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.350 
everything came out perfect and here
we're<00:02:35.070> gonna<00:02:35.160> have<00:02:35.250> where<00:02:35.670> these<00:02:35.790> shovels<00:02:36.180> are

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
we're gonna have where these shovels are

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.530 
we're gonna have where these shovels are
a<00:02:36.390> couple<00:02:36.720> of<00:02:36.900> steps<00:02:37.170> down<00:02:38.120> and<00:02:39.120> then<00:02:39.270> we<00:02:39.360> got

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
a couple of steps down and then we got

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.820 
a couple of steps down and then we got
to<00:02:39.690> make<00:02:39.840> this<00:02:39.989> is<00:02:40.170> where<00:02:40.350> we<00:02:40.440> got<00:02:40.530> to<00:02:40.680> build

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
to make this is where we got to build

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.140 
to make this is where we got to build
our<00:02:41.010> steps<00:02:41.430> to<00:02:42.209> come<00:02:42.480> up<00:02:43.610> to<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:44.730> top<00:02:44.940> of<00:02:45.090> the
