00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.600 
wizard tower so I'm thinking about
attacking<00:02:37.319> this<00:02:37.680> because<00:02:38.010> it's<00:02:38.160> not<00:02:38.280> really

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
attacking this because it's not really

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.100 
attacking this because it's not really
that<00:02:38.790> well<00:02:39.739> defended<00:02:40.940> I'm<00:02:41.940> not<00:02:42.150> I<00:02:42.420> think<00:02:42.900> want

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
that well defended I'm not I think want

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.130 
that well defended I'm not I think want
to<00:02:43.290> put<00:02:43.829> some<00:02:44.069> troops<00:02:44.340> over<00:02:44.579> here<00:02:44.940> and<00:02:45.720> some

the<00:05:08.599> archer<00:05:09.599> tower<00:05:09.810> probably<00:05:10.289> doesn't<00:05:10.500> have<00:05:10.560> a

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650 
the archer tower probably doesn't have a

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.500 
the archer tower probably doesn't have a
whole<00:05:10.680> lot<00:05:10.860> of<00:05:11.039> hell<00:05:11.960> yeah<00:05:13.639> so<00:05:14.639> let's<00:05:14.910> go<00:05:15.210> for

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
whole lot of hell yeah so let's go for

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:19.670 
whole lot of hell yeah so let's go for
that<00:05:16.400> townhall<00:05:17.690> not<00:05:18.690> sure<00:05:18.960> if<00:05:19.020> we<00:05:19.169> can<00:05:19.320> get<00:05:19.500> it

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
that townhall not sure if we can get it

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.430 
that townhall not sure if we can get it
but<00:05:19.860> let's<00:05:20.070> try<00:05:20.870> so<00:05:21.870> we<00:05:22.110> are<00:05:22.229> just<00:05:22.260> waiting<00:05:22.740> now

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440 
but let's try so we are just waiting now

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.820 
but let's try so we are just waiting now
now<00:05:25.440> how<00:05:25.650> to<00:05:25.710> store<00:05:26.039> that<00:05:26.190> I<00:05:26.250> get<00:05:26.520> 18<00:05:27.060> so

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
now how to store that I get 18 so

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:31.760 
now how to store that I get 18 so
nothing<00:05:28.830> to<00:05:29.190> happen<00:05:29.220> to<00:05:29.520> this<00:05:29.760> yet<00:05:30.060> I<00:05:30.650> think<00:05:31.650> we

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:31.770 
nothing to happen to this yet I think we

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:33.529 
nothing to happen to this yet I think we
can<00:05:31.919> get<00:05:32.039> it<00:05:32.190> in<00:05:32.250> turns<00:05:32.490> three<00:05:32.610> seconds<00:05:33.210> don't

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:33.539 
can get it in turns three seconds don't

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:37.520 
can get it in turns three seconds don't
know<00:05:34.940> kind<00:05:35.940> of<00:05:36.060> doubt<00:05:36.270> it<00:05:36.479> but<00:05:36.720> I<00:05:36.960> mean<00:05:37.260> I<00:05:37.349> get

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:37.530 
know kind of doubt it but I mean I get

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:41.330 
know kind of doubt it but I mean I get
the<00:05:37.710> elixir<00:05:38.370> and<00:05:38.490> goals<00:05:38.699> but<00:05:40.010> it's<00:05:41.010> all<00:05:41.160> good

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:41.340 
the elixir and goals but it's all good

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:46.790 
the elixir and goals but it's all good
we<00:05:41.699> still<00:05:41.940> got<00:05:42.090> quite<00:05:42.270> a<00:05:42.330> bit<00:05:42.479> trippy

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:52.110 

yeah<00:05:47.800> I<00:05:47.830> think<00:05:48.160> I<00:05:48.400> think<00:05:48.730> we<00:05:48.850> can<00:05:49.030> make<00:05:49.210> it<00:05:51.120> see

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:52.120 
yeah I think I think we can make it see

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.220 
yeah I think I think we can make it see
the<00:05:52.240> countdown<00:05:52.690> oh<00:05:54.510> got<00:05:55.510> it<00:05:55.540> at<00:05:55.720> the<00:05:55.870> last

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:01.180 
second victory at the last second so

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.510 
second victory at the last second so
