00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919

when Antonio didn't call immediately and

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.590 
when Antonio didn't call immediately and
that<00:04:20.799> made<00:04:21.070> Antonio<00:04:21.790> believe<00:04:22.150> that<00:04:22.360> Daniel

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
that made Antonio believe that Daniel

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:37.300 
that made Antonio believe that Daniel
had<00:04:22.750> quaint<00:04:23.199> he'll<00:04:23.500> came<00:04:23.889> clean
