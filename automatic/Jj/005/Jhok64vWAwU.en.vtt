my guess is like a Naruto pouch that

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.100 
my guess is like a Naruto pouch that
goes<00:01:58.410> on<00:01:58.710> their<00:01:58.860> leg<00:01:59.070> like<00:01:59.550> that<00:02:02.210> so<00:02:03.210> any<00:02:03.480> is<00:02:03.750> if

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
goes on their leg like that so any is if

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.990 
goes on their leg like that so any is if
you<00:02:04.410> can<00:02:04.620> see<00:02:04.860> it<00:02:04.980> there's<00:02:05.190> a<00:02:05.280> leaf<00:02:05.580> village
