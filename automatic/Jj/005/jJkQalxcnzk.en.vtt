00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
I guess you know for us we need every

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.910 
I guess you know for us we need every
point<00:00:18.240> that<00:00:18.480> we<00:00:18.570> can<00:00:18.720> possibly<00:00:18.840> get<00:00:19.320> and<00:00:19.619> we're

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
point that we can possibly get and we're

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.179 
point that we can possibly get and we're
in<00:00:20.039> desperation<00:00:20.460> mode<00:00:21.170> as<00:00:22.170> every<00:00:22.529> team<00:00:22.740> is<00:00:22.920> and

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
in desperation mode as every team is and

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.189 
in desperation mode as every team is and
you<00:00:24.000> know<00:00:24.029> we<00:00:24.240> just<00:00:24.449> found<00:00:24.600> a<00:00:24.750> way<00:00:24.869> to<00:00:24.930> gut<00:00:25.170> it

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
you know we just found a way to gut it

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.140 
you know we just found a way to gut it
out<00:00:25.380> with<00:00:25.619> you<00:00:26.250> know<00:00:26.340> we<00:00:26.460> gave<00:00:26.609> up<00:00:26.760> a<00:00:26.849> two<00:00:27.000> goal

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
out with you know we gave up a two goal

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.870 
out with you know we gave up a two goal
lead<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:28.080> we<00:00:28.769> found<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:29.039> way<00:00:29.160> to<00:00:29.220> get<00:00:29.340> a<00:00:29.400> big

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
lead and we found a way to get a big

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.640 
lead and we found a way to get a big
goal<00:00:30.090> I<00:00:30.119> think<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.869> odds<00:00:31.019> was<00:00:31.230> a<00:00:31.260> power-play

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
goal I think the odds was a power-play

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.830 
goal I think the odds was a power-play
goal<00:00:31.859> I<00:00:31.890> think<00:00:32.130> it<00:00:32.219> was<00:00:32.340> you<00:00:33.329> know<00:00:33.450> it<00:00:33.660> was<00:00:33.690> the

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
goal I think it was you know it was the

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.299 
goal I think it was you know it was the
end<00:00:33.960> of<00:00:33.989> a<00:00:34.079> power<00:00:34.290> place<00:00:34.559> so<00:00:34.800> that<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.100> neck

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
end of a power place so that the neck

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.790 
end of a power place so that the neck
got<00:00:35.489> us<00:00:35.610> started<00:00:35.820> then<00:00:36.149> we<00:00:36.270> started<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.800> skate

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.309 

I<00:02:38.300> didn't<00:02:39.300> realize<00:02:39.360> it<00:02:39.720> was<00:02:39.810> him<00:02:40.019> that<00:02:40.050> got

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
I didn't realize it was him that got

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.369 
I didn't realize it was him that got
three<00:02:40.590> but<00:02:40.769> I<00:02:40.830> knew<00:02:40.950> somebody<00:02:41.280> did<00:02:41.489> and<00:02:42.379> Bernie

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379 
three but I knew somebody did and Bernie

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:45.380 
three but I knew somebody did and Bernie
made<00:02:43.590> a<00:02:43.620> big<00:02:43.830> stop<00:02:44.099> with<00:02:44.340> toe<00:02:44.519> save<00:02:44.790> in<00:02:45.000> the

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
made a big stop with toe save in the

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.270 
made a big stop with toe save in the
first<00:02:45.599> period<00:02:45.840> that's<00:02:46.440> the<00:02:46.590> one<00:02:46.709> I<00:02:46.739> remember

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
first period that's the one I remember

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.339 
first period that's the one I remember
and<00:02:48.000> I<00:02:48.090> think<00:02:48.269> he<00:02:48.330> was<00:02:48.450> alone<00:02:48.660> in<00:02:48.720> front<00:02:49.140> of<00:02:49.290> the

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
and I think he was alone in front of the

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:52.820 
and I think he was alone in front of the
net<00:02:49.470> on<00:02:49.500> a<00:02:49.650> power<00:02:50.040> play<00:02:50.360> and<00:02:51.360> yes<00:02:51.810> this<00:02:52.140> before

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
net on a power play and yes this before

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.370 
net on a power play and yes this before
Mason<00:02:53.010> scored<00:02:53.519> so<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:54.030> other<00:02:54.599> 1i<00:02:54.750> I<00:02:54.840> can't

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
Mason scored so the other 1i I can't

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.740 
Mason scored so the other 1i I can't
recall<00:02:55.650> but<00:02:56.099> I'm<00:02:56.580> sure<00:02:56.819> I'll<00:02:57.000> get<00:02:57.330> a<00:02:57.390> good<00:02:57.540> look

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
recall but I'm sure I'll get a good look

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:04.850 
recall but I'm sure I'll get a good look
at<00:02:57.930> it<00:03:01.370> I<00:03:02.370> think<00:03:03.090> you<00:03:03.239> know<00:03:03.630> I<00:03:03.660> think<00:03:03.989> the<00:03:04.709> one

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
at it I think you know I think the one

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.789 
at it I think you know I think the one
thing<00:03:04.920> there<00:03:05.700> wasn't<00:03:05.849> any<00:03:06.030> rebound<00:03:06.799> rebound

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
thing there wasn't any rebound rebound

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:11.570 
thing there wasn't any rebound rebound
control<00:03:08.310> was<00:03:08.489> definitely<00:03:09.180> in<00:03:09.390> his<00:03:09.870> favor<00:03:10.580> and

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
control was definitely in his favor and

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.819 
control was definitely in his favor and
that's<00:03:12.360> with<00:03:12.720> any<00:03:12.870> goaltender<00:03:13.500> if<00:03:13.590> you<00:03:13.680> can

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
that's with any goaltender if you can

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:15.229 
that's with any goaltender if you can
control<00:03:14.099> your<00:03:14.250> rebounds<00:03:14.760> and<00:03:14.910> we<00:03:15.090> can

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
control your rebounds and we can

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.210 
control your rebounds and we can
eliminate<00:03:16.200> those<00:03:16.560> second<00:03:16.980> and<00:03:17.099> third

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
eliminate those second and third

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.430 
eliminate those second and third
opportunities<00:03:17.970> then<00:03:18.299> if<00:03:18.630> they<00:03:18.780> usually<00:03:19.230> see

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
opportunities then if they usually see

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.100 
opportunities then if they usually see
it<00:03:19.530> they<00:03:20.310> stop<00:03:20.579> it<00:03:20.819> and<00:03:21.000> some<00:03:21.780> of<00:03:21.900> the<00:03:21.959> bigger

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
it they stop it and some of the bigger

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.020 
it they stop it and some of the bigger
goalies<00:03:22.560> stop<00:03:22.860> it<00:03:23.069> even<00:03:23.549> when<00:03:23.640> they<00:03:23.730> don't<00:03:23.819> see

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
goalies stop it even when they don't see

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.150 
goalies stop it even when they don't see
it
