this<00:00:00.690> is<00:00:00.989> the<00:00:01.260> gathered<00:00:01.709> bind-off<00:00:02.340> or<00:00:03.179> cast

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
this is the gathered bind-off or cast

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.039 
this is the gathered bind-off or cast
off<00:00:04.020> there<00:00:04.319> are<00:00:04.470> several<00:00:04.740> different<00:00:05.339> ways<00:00:05.490> to

00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:06.049 
off there are several different ways to

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:10.240 
off there are several different ways to
cast<00:00:07.049> off<00:00:07.350> this<00:00:07.919> is<00:00:08.189> one<00:00:08.400> of<00:00:08.429> the<00:00:08.700> simpler<00:00:09.210> ones

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:10.250 
cast off this is one of the simpler ones

cast off this is one of the simpler ones
cut<00:00:11.250> your<00:00:11.460> working<00:00:11.759> yarn

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:23.750 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.020 

feed<00:00:24.380> the<00:00:24.620> end<00:00:24.890> of<00:00:25.160> your<00:00:25.310> working<00:00:25.610> yarn

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:26.030 
feed the end of your working yarn

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:45.860 
feed the end of your working yarn
through<00:00:26.540> a<00:00:26.570> yarn<00:00:26.960> needle

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.150 

working<00:00:46.830> around<00:00:47.450> the<00:00:48.450> Loom<00:00:48.830> simply<00:00:49.830> slow

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
working around the Loom simply slow

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.830 
working around the Loom simply slow
through<00:00:50.580> each<00:00:51.800> loop<00:00:52.800> as<00:00:53.100> you<00:00:53.420> remove<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:54.630> from

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
through each loop as you remove it from

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:17.250 
through each loop as you remove it from
the<00:00:55.050> peg

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:17.260 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:24.859 

so<00:01:17.890> through<00:01:19.320> liftoff

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.830 

so<00:01:25.439> through<00:01:26.689> liftoff<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:29.360> you<00:01:30.360> just<00:01:30.540> continue

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
so through liftoff and you just continue

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.350 
so through liftoff and you just continue
around<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:32.340> Loom<00:01:34.490> the<00:01:35.490> reason<00:01:35.939> that<00:01:36.090> this<00:01:36.299> is

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
around the Loom the reason that this is

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.050 
around the Loom the reason that this is
called<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:37.259> gathering<00:01:38.130> bind<00:01:38.399> off<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:38.990> because

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
called the gathering bind off is because

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.539 
called the gathering bind off is because
pulling<00:01:42.060> on<00:01:42.240> this<00:01:43.049> once<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:43.710> have<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.250> net

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
pulling on this once you have the net

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.300 
pulling on this once you have the net
removed<00:01:45.060> from<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.689> Loom<00:01:45.899> will<00:01:46.740> cause<00:01:47.009> it<00:01:47.280> to

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
removed from the Loom will cause it to

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.380 
removed from the Loom will cause it to
cinch<00:01:47.789> up<00:01:48.000> on<00:01:48.890> the<00:01:49.890> end<00:01:50.100> of<00:01:50.369> your<00:01:50.520> bind<00:01:50.820> off<00:01:51.090> or

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
cinch up on the end of your bind off or

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.010 
cinch up on the end of your bind off or
the<00:01:51.570> end<00:01:51.750> of<00:01:51.990> your<00:01:52.649> cast<00:01:52.950> off<00:01:53.509> so<00:01:54.509> it<00:01:54.630> can<00:01:54.659> be

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
the end of your cast off so it can be

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.340 
the end of your cast off so it can be
used<00:01:55.320> for<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.770> top<00:01:55.979> of<00:01:56.299> hats<00:01:57.299> or<00:01:57.750> stocking

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
used for the top of hats or stocking

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.649
