this oil and tender is important thing

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.230 
this oil and tender is important thing
that<00:01:28.690> this<00:01:28.870> oil<00:01:29.260> must<00:01:29.770> be<00:01:30.070> high<00:01:30.460> quality<00:01:30.520> oil

synthetic and let's look closer when you

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.040 
synthetic and let's look closer when you
go<00:01:38.350> to<00:01:38.410> purchase<00:01:38.740> oil<00:01:39.520> there<00:01:40.390> must<00:01:40.660> be<00:01:40.870> this

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 
go to purchase oil there must be this

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.690 
go to purchase oil there must be this

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
logo full synthetic motor oil because it

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.680 
logo full synthetic motor oil because it
cleans<00:01:46.060> better<00:01:46.690> this<00:01:47.320> engine<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.880> then<00:01:49.300> what

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 
cleans better this engine and then what

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:55.050 
cleans better this engine and then what
else<00:01:49.930> they<00:01:50.260> need<00:01:50.730> we<00:01:51.730> need<00:01:52.140> good<00:01:53.140> quality<00:01:54.060> oil

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
else they need we need good quality oil

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.460 
else they need we need good quality oil
filter<00:01:55.930> and<00:01:56.260> this<00:01:56.500> is<00:01:56.560> like<00:01:56.830> kinetic<00:01:57.400> example

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
filter and this is like kinetic example

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.580 
filter and this is like kinetic example
because<00:01:59.470> this<00:01:59.680> oil<00:02:00.220> filter<00:02:00.790> cleans<00:02:01.590> this

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
because this oil filter cleans this

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.620 
because this oil filter cleans this
dirty<00:02:03.510> engines<00:02:04.510> inside<00:02:05.440> areas<00:02:05.950> and<00:02:06.250> how<00:02:07.240> to<00:02:07.300> do

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
dirty engines inside areas and how to do

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.350 
dirty engines inside areas and how to do
then<00:02:08.020> this<00:02:08.170> oil<00:02:08.500> forcing<00:02:09.069> it<00:02:09.429> happens<00:02:09.910> sorted

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
then this oil forcing it happens sorted

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.610 
then this oil forcing it happens sorted
in<00:02:10.509> first<00:02:10.810> that<00:02:11.099> we<00:02:12.099> need<00:02:12.370> to<00:02:12.610> purchase<00:02:13.620> those

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
in first that we need to purchase those

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:21.849 
an engine oil and motor oil and then we

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:25.750 
an engine oil and motor oil and then we
need<00:02:22.120> at<00:02:22.420> least<00:02:22.450> one<00:02:22.930> time<00:02:23.440> this<00:02:24.100> fool<00:02:24.460> and
