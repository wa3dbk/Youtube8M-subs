00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
get it right at and then you go ahead

split line of the chassis and just keep
doing<00:01:26.810> this<00:01:26.960> you<00:01:27.140> have<00:01:27.260> to<00:01:27.380> do<00:01:28.220> it<00:01:28.340> a<00:01:28.430> few<00:01:28.640> times

doing this you have to do it a few times

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.180 
doing this you have to do it a few times
probably<00:01:29.560> twice<00:01:30.560> on<00:01:30.890> each<00:01:32.590> c4<00:01:33.590> it'll<00:01:33.800> open<00:01:33.920> up

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:34.190 
probably twice on each c4 it'll open up

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.370 
probably twice on each c4 it'll open up
and<00:01:34.400> then<00:01:34.520> you<00:01:34.640> wrap<00:01:34.880> on<00:01:35.120> it<00:01:35.150> these<00:01:35.900> are<00:01:36.110> prime

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
and then you wrap on it these are prime

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.140 
and then you wrap on it these are prime
screwdriver<00:01:37.070> wrap<00:01:37.340> on<00:01:37.520> it

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:43.760 
ahead and solder the wires back on

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.870 
ahead and solder the wires back on
towards<00:01:44.120> our<00:01:44.330> goal<00:01:44.540> properly<00:01:45.110> and<00:01:45.320> kind<00:01:45.530> of

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
towards our goal properly and kind of

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.750 
towards our goal properly and kind of

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:49.760 
monkey it all back together I know it

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.870 
monkey it all back together I know it
seems<00:01:50.030> like<00:01:50.860> this<00:01:51.860> is<00:01:52.040> kind<00:01:52.280> of<00:01:52.310> a<00:01:52.400> silly<00:01:52.640> thing

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
seems like this is kind of a silly thing

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.390 
seems like this is kind of a silly thing
to<00:01:52.940> do<00:01:53.270> adaptors<00:01:53.930> are<00:01:54.050> a<00:01:54.110> dime<00:01:54.380> a<00:01:54.410> dozen<00:01:54.710> but<00:01:54.980> it

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
to do adaptors are a dime a dozen but it

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.040 
to do adaptors are a dime a dozen but it
really<00:01:55.610> only<00:01:55.820> takes<00:01:56.150> me<00:01:56.300> a<00:01:56.360> couple<00:01:56.570> minutes<00:01:56.750> to

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 
really only takes me a couple minutes to

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.100 
really only takes me a couple minutes to
do<00:01:57.230> it<00:01:57.260> this<00:01:58.250> is<00:01:58.310> the<00:01:58.490> original<00:01:58.790> Atari<00:01:59.390> adapter

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
do it this is the original Atari adapter

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.720 
do it this is the original Atari adapter
I<00:02:01.090> think<00:02:02.090> this<00:02:02.330> you<00:02:02.990> know<00:02:03.250> probably<00:02:04.250> since<00:02:04.550> I

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:04.730 
I think this you know probably since I

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:08.680 
I think this you know probably since I
was<00:02:04.910> 12<00:02:05.150> 13<00:02:05.300> years<00:02:05.720> old<00:02:05.930> so<00:02:07.360> it's<00:02:08.360> just<00:02:08.600> a

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
was 12 13 years old so it's just a

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.020 
was 12 13 years old so it's just a
little<00:02:08.929> sentimental<00:02:09.500> value<00:02:10.310> to<00:02:10.459> it<00:02:10.610> for<00:02:10.880> maybe

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
little sentimental value to it for maybe

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.260 
little sentimental value to it for maybe
fixing<00:02:11.690> it<00:02:11.810> you<00:02:12.320> do<00:02:12.530> want<00:02:12.800> to<00:02:12.890> use<00:02:13.610> ventilation

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
fixing it you do want to use ventilation

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.930 
fixing it you do want to use ventilation
but<00:02:15.010> smokers<00:02:16.010> really<00:02:16.580> bad<00:02:16.790> nose

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
but smokers really bad nose

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.020 
but smokers really bad nose
so<00:02:18.620> go<00:02:19.620> ahead<00:02:19.740> and<00:02:19.950> cut<00:02:20.160> this<00:02:20.400> anymore

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
so go ahead and cut this anymore

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.020 
so go ahead and cut this anymore
Cherie<00:02:21.720> I<00:02:22.010> satiric<00:02:23.010> a<00:02:23.130> condor<00:02:23.610> in<00:02:23.670> just<00:02:23.910> a

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
Cherie I satiric a condor in just a

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.590 
Cherie I satiric a condor in just a
second<00:02:24.420> okay<00:02:25.700> so<00:02:26.700> I<00:02:26.850> went<00:02:27.090> ahead<00:02:27.150> and<00:02:27.270> crack

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
second okay so I went ahead and crack

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.480 
second okay so I went ahead and crack
the<00:02:27.780> case<00:02:27.990> I<00:02:28.170> took<00:02:28.230> a<00:02:28.410> look<00:02:28.620> at<00:02:28.830> it<00:02:28.980> now<00:02:29.130> this

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
the case I took a look at it now this

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.520 
the case I took a look at it now this
wire<00:02:29.760> has<00:02:30.090> a<00:02:30.120> stripe<00:02:30.570> on<00:02:30.780> it<00:02:31.050> it's<00:02:31.200> probably

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
wire has a stripe on it it's probably

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:32.870 
wire has a stripe on it it's probably
the<00:02:31.620> negative<00:02:32.070> so<00:02:32.280> I'm<00:02:32.400> going<00:02:32.610> to<00:02:32.670> put<00:02:32.850> a

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
the negative so I'm going to put a

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.630 
the negative so I'm going to put a
little<00:02:33.060> hash<00:02:33.330> mark<00:02:33.690> here<00:02:33.920> for<00:02:34.920> negative<00:02:35.370> and

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
little hash mark here for negative and

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.460

that's supposed to protect the wire from

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.680 
that's supposed to protect the wire from
breaking<00:02:41.100> so<00:02:41.670> we're<00:02:41.850> going<00:02:41.970> to<00:02:42.030> run<00:02:42.390> a<00:02:42.450> drill

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690

before<00:02:47.040> you<00:02:47.310> solder<00:02:47.550> and<00:02:47.790> I<00:02:47.880> make<00:02:48.030> that

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
before you solder and I make that

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
mistake every time I do this then we're

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.940 
mistake every time I do this then we're
going<00:02:50.700> to<00:02:50.870> just<00:02:51.870> tape<00:02:52.050> it<00:02:52.200> back<00:02:52.260> up<00:02:52.650> and<00:02:52.890> you

the wires first that means I put a

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.200 
the wires first that means I put a
little<00:03:19.800> flux<00:03:20.100> on<00:03:20.310> and<00:03:20.550> soldered<00:03:20.910> them<00:03:21.000> and

little flux on and soldered them and

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.580 
little flux on and soldered them and
then<00:03:21.300> snip<00:03:21.600> them<00:03:21.750> so<00:03:21.900> they<00:03:22.020> were<00:03:22.080> nice<00:03:22.320> pointy

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
then snip them so they were nice pointy
