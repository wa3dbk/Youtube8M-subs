00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
body recognizes the strange protein it

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.470 
body recognizes the strange protein it
makes<00:02:29.910> an<00:02:30.060> antibody<00:02:30.590> and<00:02:31.590> that<00:02:32.430> antibody<00:02:33.060> if

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
makes an antibody and that antibody if

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.890 
makes an antibody and that antibody if
that<00:02:34.130> sequence<00:02:35.130> of<00:02:35.310> amino<00:02:35.490> acids<00:02:36.270> happens<00:02:36.690> to

blood is an antibody to that amino acid
sequence<00:02:42.480> and<00:02:42.870> then<00:02:43.530> that<00:02:43.740> same<00:02:44.100> antibody

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
sequence and then that same antibody

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.110

attacks<00:02:46.020> your<00:02:46.440> own<00:02:46.710> betta<00:02:47.280> cells<00:02:47.820> and

destroys<00:02:48.720> your<00:02:48.960> pancreas<00:02:49.500> and<00:02:49.800> then<00:02:50.520> you<00:02:50.640> have

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
destroys your pancreas and then you have

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.120 
destroys your pancreas and then you have
diabetes<00:02:51.510> type<00:02:51.750> 1<00:02:52.020> and<00:02:52.200> you<00:02:52.650> have<00:02:52.680> no<00:02:52.980> more

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
diabetes type 1 and you have no more

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.280 
diabetes type 1 and you have no more
insulin<00:02:53.640> producing<00:02:54.180> cells<00:02:54.240> and<00:02:54.780> then<00:02:55.170> you

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
insulin producing cells and then you

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.260 
insulin producing cells and then you
have<00:02:55.410> type<00:02:55.620> B<00:02:55.770> this<00:02:55.920> type<00:02:56.130> 1<00:02:56.340> then<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:56.910> only

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
have type B this type 1 then the only

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.570 
have type B this type 1 then the only
solution<00:02:57.750> is<00:02:57.870> to<00:02:57.930> take<00:02:58.350> insulin<00:02:58.950> for<00:02:59.280> the<00:02:59.400> rest

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
solution is to take insulin for the rest

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.300

researchers from Rome and London said

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:54.670 
researchers from Rome and London said
they<00:04:52.910> studied<00:04:53.300> 47<00:04:53.960> patients<00:04:54.470> who<00:04:54.560> had

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
they studied 47 patients who had

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.010 
they studied 47 patients who had
recently<00:04:54.889> developed<00:04:55.389> insulin<00:04:56.389> dependent

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.820 
recently developed insulin dependent
diabetes<00:04:57.440> and<00:04:58.340> found<00:04:59.060> that<00:04:59.330> 51<00:05:00.169> percent<00:05:00.199> of

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
diabetes and found that 51 percent of

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.029 
diabetes and found that 51 percent of
them<00:05:00.979> had<00:05:01.160> immune<00:05:01.669> cells<00:05:02.030> that<00:05:02.330> grew<00:05:02.720> and

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:03.039 
them had immune cells that grew and

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:05.890 
them had immune cells that grew and
replicated<00:05:04.039> when<00:05:04.639> exposed<00:05:05.090> to<00:05:05.300> a<00:05:05.330> protein

the<00:05:16.639> cow's<00:05:16.880> milk<00:05:17.300> protein<00:05:17.800> so<00:05:18.800> there<00:05:19.310> you<00:05:19.460> have

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:19.639 
the cow's milk protein so there you have

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:24.729 
the cow's milk protein so there you have
it<00:05:19.930> casein<00:05:20.930> seems<00:05:21.410> to<00:05:21.710> be<00:05:21.889> the<00:05:22.490> problem
