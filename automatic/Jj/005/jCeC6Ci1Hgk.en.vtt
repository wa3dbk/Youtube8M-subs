00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:04.740
 in Ontario 

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.910
 terror in a channel 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.480
 there are people at the top could 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.480
 die 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.100
 a cargo ship collides with a bridge 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:29.040
 that was lowered just in its path 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.110
 transporting 26 million kilos the 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.440
 huge ship can not be stopped in the 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.440
 Water 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.500
 even when its cover is broken in 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.500
 pieces 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.940
 when the ship leaves on the other side 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.010
 they will have time to get out of there and 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.059
 definitely the whole top 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.059
 has been ripped 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.880
 but the nightmare is just beginning 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.730
 the collision has destroyed the bridge 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.890
 command is impossible to govern the 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:06.239
 monstrous ship while advancing without 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.239
 control through the channel 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:13.590
 because they do not stop 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.590
 more directly to the shore yes 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:20.710
 it's right under the fire 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.340
 but their efforts are in vain 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.960
 when the sun rises the next morning 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.980
 what was once a powerful ship 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:32.590
 now it looks like a junkyard 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.980
 and the solid steel bridge is a ruin 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.670
 impassable with road sections now 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:40.640
 nonexistent 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:45.370
 but there is a positive side 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.370
 the whole crew was alive 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.740
 time later it is determined that the 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.790
 bridge operator was under the 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.790
 influence of alcohol 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.530
 he was lucky that his stupid action did not 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:01.860
 convert this channel into a river of 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.860
 blood
