00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 Good day to all of us today 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:08.670
 regular meeting and today we are going again 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:11.099
 love the attention of black currant I already 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.780
 talked about this wonderful berries 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.660
 who will be interested can see 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.350
 video about the beneficial properties of black 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.680
 currants 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.050
 and today we will cook with you 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:25.199
 black currant compote with apples 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:29.210
 I think that many mistresses this recipe 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.769
 I introduce yet I want to share exactly 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:34.620
 his way of cooking this 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.840
 dishes and that we will need you 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.829
 of course black currant we her 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.010
 went over 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:44.700
 washed and prepared the necessary 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.629
 number of berries for cooking 3 3 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.809
 liter jars 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.989
 compote a small addition we take 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.600
 apples can of course without them but I 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.719
 I think that it will be tastier and more interesting 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.910
 as you can see we are already all 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:02.480
 prepared of course the panels overcame 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:06.450
 stem and taken here on such slices 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:08.850
 as i said we will today 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.430
 cook 3 3 liter jars of this 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.830
 wonderful drink then of course i 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.119
 already counted as needed 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.049
 sugar sand 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:21.780
 of course yes everyone has a different dosage 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.360
 so let's say berries and sugar 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:28.100
 so who will find a kilogram of sugar 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.540
 per liter of syrup I think that this too 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.850
 rules are correct because everything 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.130
 depends, of course, primarily on 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.640
 the conditions in which we store the blanks 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.700
 but usually I do it now let's 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:45.390
 dad okay i will tell everything i mean i 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.680
 roughly counting how many berries I have 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.380
 and by this 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.909
 I'm preparing a three-liter jar of course 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.939
 Here you can see that I have everything already 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.520
 already prepared the jar is sterilized I 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:02:00.659
 take your favorite pot any convenient 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.280
 for you to immediately prepare the syrup we 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.530
 be with you also a little 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.510
 what run for running ahead and say that 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.209
 will be our fruit and y 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:11.160
 and blanch berries thus need 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.910
 try to find the most convenient 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.410
 tara for this procedure 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.959
 since of course to say exactly how much 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.540
 you need to prepare the syrup is difficult because 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:25.560
 we'll be laying berries and you 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:29.540
 apples directly into the jar and for 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:32.280
 start i put the pot on the fire and 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:35.250
 pour the necessary amount of water here 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:38.550
 look i pour of course on the eye 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.709
 about that much water on 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:45.830
 one will be ready to a jar of compote 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.830
 I have three such banks, I pour it all 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.890
 because I got almost the whole 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:54.959
 pan 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:57.360
 I turn on the fire and at this time let our 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:01.250
 our water boils thereby accelerating 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:03.750
 process you see that I have a jar already 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.630
 being sterilized now we will deal with what 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.510
 we will lay down more accurately measure 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.459
 the required number of berries and apples 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.900
 you will need dishes with which we 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.239
 can download our 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.329
 berries and cut the fruit it is and what are you 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:21.390
 cook compote in hot water i 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:25.350
 I 'll use the sieve so you and me 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:27.299
 need you since i am about 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:30.269
 counted on one three-liter 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:33.180
 jar of compote we will need three of you 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:36.390
 Glasses of berries 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.609
 faceted glass and I measured out everything that is 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.390
 the number of berries and the amount of sugar 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:45.120
 Now I have 3 cups of berries 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:48.019
 measure out laying it like this 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:52.260
 way and two small apple bones 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:54.870
 everything goes in my sieve all together 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.390
 here blanch it now you and me 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:01.049
 you must wait for the water to 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:03.150
 the pot boiled and we need to be pro 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:06.120
 blanch already from a slow portion 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:09.150
 berries and apples and lay it all in 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.989
 sterilized jar and so you see 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:15.000
 that our berry fruit or rather 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:17.459
 currant apple mixture already in banks 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.530
 and now on the line we have cooking 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.780
 syrup 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:25.740
 clarifying how much I took sugar 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:29.639
 sand principle i think is enough 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:32.760
 will be for one jar 3 cup of sugar 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:35.010
 sand that is it somewhere within 6,106 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:38.070
 150 grams of granulated sugar 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:40.560
 all this i send our our boiling 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:43.070
 water that is, you see what she changed 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:46.169
 color as we planned for 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:49.560
 one minute here our currants with 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:53.630
 apples this foam is of course better 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:56.820
 take off and now we are preparing syrup 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:59.400
 we all mix well with you 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:03.660
 Of course it is necessary that sugar 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:07.800
 sold and let our syrup boil 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:12.470
 5-10 minutes and then of course we fill 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:15.870
 it in jars and roll our compote 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:18.690
 so our black currant compote with 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:20.970
 apples of course better and better jars 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:22.590
 flip cover something warm on 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:26.160
 complete cooling and then removed in 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:30.260
 cool place well and that's it 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.260
 See you soon and enjoy your meal
