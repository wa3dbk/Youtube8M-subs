00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 hello all, I love my day a 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.339
 click tip for you and since you 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.710
 maybe looking for the 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.960
 perfect vegans on whippable cream 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.120
 then I have them for me at least 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.889
 I do not know if you like her 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.389
 just as well , but I'm fine 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.609
 Imagine this just as excited 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.500
 of it and that is that of these 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.090
 shock rear 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.980
 that's a sweet variation now 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.890
 I bought the ones in Kaufland 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.930
 There has been a short time in the buying country 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.390
 really pay attention to that there really 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:32.820
 100% vegan is on it because of that 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.300
 did not care anymore did not always stand 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.370
 next to this spray bottle next to this 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.320
 SprÃ¼hsahne the vegan is the 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.930
 really great as places to the side 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.210
 its to be pitched at the 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.520
 really no problem is that I am today 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.920
 again on that 100% vegan on it 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.140
 is behind is just that again 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.420
 we even hint on it here are still 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.550
 times the ingredients 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.469
 I know it is probably from the 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.510
 Ingredients list not the best vegan 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.010
 Cream is the most but 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.799
 not I already do not know that 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.600
 Hollager tried the soy or all 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.939
 then have three different variants 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.760
 I tried the rich the new blow 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.260
 fix in the big one in the tobacco then have 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.939
 I chris hoy bioladen from the 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.680
 probably will not try it that way 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.840
 Many numbers will be like this 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.400
 cream here too 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.560
 not so good open 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.670
 I have the tip for you 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.720
 Cream before she wanted to open 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.750
 early in the refrigerator 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.210
 is therefore set up really chilled 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.090
 then really only one pack at one 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.650
 pack cream a pack of cream stiff 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.790
 maybe a little bit more 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.990
 Vanilla sugar does not stop there 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.159
 so that's just a little sweetened 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.020
 I find really delicious and 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.710
 then simply bowl full 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.970
 hit 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.280
 why I always do with the 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.869
 kitchenaid thinks about that, though 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.240
 even with normal hand mixer 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.649
 why should not shut up why not 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.299
 Perhaps the highest level is still there 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.520
 a bit of time then she will open 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.689
 every case was really right 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.960
 I have never had it before 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.549
 always experimented for a long time around 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.049
 vegans may say that 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.780
 or other but also no flour 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.280
 added because they never really stuck 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.500
 and that is really from 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.180
 top taste I have it today 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.250
 eaten waffles and then stop too 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.350
 really not eaten pure in any way 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.720
 a cream or so processed and she 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.790
 can be really pure totally good food 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.260
 this is my tip for you is im 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.870
 I also think that businessman is quite cheap 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.790
 have paid 79 cents for it are 200 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.860
 milliliter in it to the Sun as a small 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.150
 tip for you 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.220
 if now my other quicktipp 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.500
 wanted to see with the vegetables and spinach 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.030
 idylle chopsticks and then looks 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.770
 I'm going to now link short time 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.770
 So then bye bye
