sancar request mechanism let me show you

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.150 
sancar request mechanism let me show you
first<00:00:07.080> off<00:00:07.230> when<00:00:07.440> you<00:00:07.529> push<00:00:07.710> the<00:00:07.859> request

button<00:00:08.370> cart<00:00:09.240> shows<00:00:09.450> up<00:00:09.599> almost<00:00:09.870> immediately

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
button cart shows up almost immediately

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.470 
button cart shows up almost immediately
and<00:00:10.769> doesn't<00:00:11.370> rely<00:00:11.519> on<00:00:11.639> any<00:00:11.759> Pistons<00:00:12.210> to<00:00:12.360> get

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
and doesn't rely on any Pistons to get

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.320 
and doesn't rely on any Pistons to get
up<00:00:12.570> here<00:00:12.780> and<00:00:13.040> then<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.309> launch<00:00:14.639> mechanism<00:00:14.849> is

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
up here and then the launch mechanism is

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.300 
up here and then the launch mechanism is
the<00:00:15.450> same<00:00:15.630> as<00:00:15.750> he<00:00:15.870> had<00:00:16.080> where<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:17.039> sticky

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
the same as he had where the sticky

and<00:00:19.890> lunches<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.310> card<00:00:20.630> so<00:00:21.630> let<00:00:21.750> me<00:00:21.779> show<00:00:21.930> you

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
and lunches the card so let me show you

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:22.970 
and lunches the card so let me show you
what's<00:00:22.170> going<00:00:22.289> on<00:00:22.470> it's<00:00:22.650> actually<00:00:22.890> pretty

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
what's going on it's actually pretty

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.609 
what's going on it's actually pretty
simple<00:00:23.250> it<00:00:24.240> relies<00:00:24.480> on<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.720> glitch<00:00:25.019> where<00:00:25.410> mine

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
simple it relies on a glitch where mine

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.320 
simple it relies on a glitch where mine
cards<00:00:25.920> can<00:00:26.070> travel<00:00:26.279> straight<00:00:26.609> through<00:00:26.939> blocks

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330

that are above a slope track as you see
mine<00:00:31.109> cart<00:00:31.349> goes<00:00:31.500> straight<00:00:31.800> through<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:32.040> slow

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
mine cart goes straight through the slow

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
soul sand this time I'm a PEZ dispenser

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.060 
soul sand this time I'm a PEZ dispenser
hooked<00:00:59.670> up<00:00:59.820> so<00:01:00.030> when<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:01.079> request<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.770> card<00:01:01.980> it

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
comes from the bottom of the pez

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.690 
comes from the bottom of the pez
dispenser<00:01:03.780> goes<00:01:04.409> on<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.680> soul<00:01:04.860> sand<00:01:05.070> now

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
dispenser goes on to the soul sand now

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.649 
dispenser goes on to the soul sand now
if<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:06.000> request<00:01:06.450> another<00:01:06.689> cart<00:01:07.310> you<00:01:08.310> can<00:01:08.460> see<00:01:08.700> it

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
if I request another cart you can see it

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.270 
if I request another cart you can see it
just<00:01:09.780> rolls<00:01:10.049> right<00:01:10.170> back<00:01:10.470> on<00:01:10.680> top<00:01:10.710> of<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.130> pez

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
just rolls right back on top of the pez

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.760 
just rolls right back on top of the pez
dispenser<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:12.570> way<00:01:12.659> that<00:01:12.840> works<00:01:12.990> is<00:01:13.260> when<00:01:13.650> the

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
dispenser the way that works is when the

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.800 
dispenser the way that works is when the
part<00:01:14.010> comes<00:01:14.040> up<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.670> bounces<00:01:15.390> off<00:01:15.540> of<00:01:15.570> this

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
part comes up it bounces off of this

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.280 
part comes up it bounces off of this
cart<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:17.420> rolls<00:01:18.420> back<00:01:18.600> down<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.840> hill<00:01:18.990> and

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
cart and rolls back down the hill and

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.050 
cart and rolls back down the hill and
then<00:01:19.439> up<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.070> top<00:01:20.250> of<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.430> pez<00:01:20.610> dispenser

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
then up to the top of the pez dispenser

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.270 
then up to the top of the pez dispenser
this<00:01:21.600> is<00:01:21.689> great<00:01:21.810> because<00:01:22.110> it<00:01:22.530> means<00:01:22.680> that<00:01:23.040> when

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
this is great because it means that when

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.679 
this is great because it means that when
your<00:01:23.400> request<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.820> cart<00:01:24.060> there's<00:01:24.390> already<00:01:24.570> a

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
your request a cart there's already a

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.530 
your request a cart there's already a
cart<00:01:24.990> there<00:01:25.229> then<00:01:25.970> the<00:01:26.970> cart<00:01:27.210> will<00:01:27.330> just

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
cart there then the cart will just

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.840 
cart there then the cart will just
behave<00:01:28.259> nicely<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:29.070> won't<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.490> we'll<00:01:29.729> go

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
behave nicely and won't and we'll go

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.480 
behave nicely and won't and we'll go
back<00:01:29.939> to<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.090> top<00:01:30.390> of<00:01:30.420> your<00:01:30.509> pez<00:01:30.659> dispenser

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
back to the top of your pez dispenser

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.390 
back to the top of your pez dispenser
and<00:01:32.570> in<00:01:33.570> fact<00:01:33.750> there's<00:01:33.990> another<00:01:34.710> neat<00:01:35.070> trick

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
and in fact there's another neat trick

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.490 
and in fact there's another neat trick
you<00:01:35.520> can<00:01:35.549> do<00:01:35.759> with<00:01:35.880> that<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.299> it's<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.200> hook<00:01:37.380> it

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
you can do with that and it's to hook it

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.469 
you can do with that and it's to hook it
up<00:01:37.650> hook<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.310> pez<00:01:38.490> dispenser<00:01:38.909> up<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.150> a<00:01:39.180> clock

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
up hook the pez dispenser up to a clock

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.990 
up hook the pez dispenser up to a clock
so<00:01:40.439> now<00:01:40.560> I<00:01:40.799> don't<00:01:41.070> even<00:01:41.159> need<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.400> call<00:01:41.670> button

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
so now I don't even need a call button

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.380 
so now I don't even need a call button
and<00:01:43.430> there<00:01:44.430> will<00:01:44.579> always<00:01:44.729> be<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:44.970> cart<00:01:45.270> waiting

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
and there will always be a cart waiting

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.469 
and there will always be a cart waiting
for<00:01:45.720> me<00:01:45.840> so<00:01:46.740> you<00:01:47.100> see<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:47.280> push<00:01:48.240> this<00:01:48.420> button

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
for me so you see I push this button

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.270 
for me so you see I push this button
this<00:01:49.259> button<00:01:49.470> hooked<00:01:49.829> up<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.100> little

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
this button hooked up to a little

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.920 
this button hooked up to a little
monostable<00:01:50.640> circuit<00:01:51.090> back<00:01:51.180> here<00:01:51.450> so<00:01:51.659> that<00:01:51.899> the

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
monostable circuit back here so that the

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.340 
monostable circuit back here so that the
pulse<00:01:52.829> duration<00:01:53.220> short<00:01:53.520> on<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.759> city

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
pulse duration short on the city

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.420 
pulse duration short on the city
and<00:01:54.850> so<00:01:55.850> it<00:01:56.840> launches<00:01:57.200> the<00:01:57.259> cart<00:01:57.590> and<00:01:57.799> a<00:01:58.310> new

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
and so it launches the cart and a new

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.609 
and so it launches the cart and a new
one<00:01:58.549> immediately<00:01:58.939> takes<00:01:59.210> its<00:01:59.390> place<00:01:59.530> you<00:02:00.530> can

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
one immediately takes its place you can

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:03.670 
one immediately takes its place you can
see<00:02:00.770> I<00:02:00.799> can<00:02:00.860> launch<00:02:01.189> it<00:02:01.280> again<00:02:02.229> new<00:02:03.229> card<00:02:03.470> shows

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
see I can launch it again new card shows

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.050 
see I can launch it again new card shows
up<00:02:04.509> you<00:02:05.509> don't<00:02:05.659> even<00:02:05.900> need<00:02:06.580> any<00:02:07.580> sort<00:02:07.909> of<00:02:07.970> a

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060
