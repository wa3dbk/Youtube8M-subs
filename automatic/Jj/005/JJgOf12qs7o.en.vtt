salesmen<00:00:27.029> in<00:00:27.150> my<00:00:27.269> opinion<00:00:27.920> first<00:00:28.920> of<00:00:29.130> all<00:00:29.250> the

salesmen in my opinion first of all the

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.170 
salesmen in my opinion first of all the
way<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.210> body<00:00:30.420> reduces<00:00:31.260> fat<00:00:31.560> and/or<00:00:32.309> adds<00:00:32.579> fat

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
way the body reduces fat and/or adds fat

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.479 
way the body reduces fat and/or adds fat
is<00:00:33.450> genetically<00:00:34.170> controlled<00:00:34.590> you<00:00:35.040> can<00:00:35.219> see

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
is genetically controlled you can see

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.150 
is genetically controlled you can see
that<00:00:35.700> by<00:00:36.000> just<00:00:36.239> looking<00:00:36.780> around<00:00:37.100> at<00:00:38.100> different

that by just looking around at different

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.610 
that by just looking around at different
families<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:39.360> you'll<00:00:39.480> notice<00:00:39.719> where<00:00:40.170> people
