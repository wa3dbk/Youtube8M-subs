 today in this video we are going to learn to 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.980
 playing the song of / for me is a 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.770
 pretty simple song because it has 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.000
 chords very simple but very cute the 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.800
 let's learn for acoustic guitar 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.350
 but they do have law guitar from there 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.240
 I remembered you can also learn and it's 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.890
 ideal for beginners remember that 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.180
 beginners can click on 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.220

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.350

 free with a report that goes 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.430
 to help a lot if they are starting 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.020
 with this world of the guitar 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.850
 Now let's bring the camera closer to see how 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.040
 is this song although today we are going to 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.010
 learn this song which is very 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.140
 simple has pretty simple chords 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:39.890
 you also have to have like pepe 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.659
 Luis another song from / that taught 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.830
 you have to have certain indigo with the 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:44.250
 right hand that has to be fine 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.330
 loose not 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.330
 what would be the next 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.080
 We will learn the rhythm 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:03.040
 chord sun here 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.040
 and we are going to do 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:09.539
 play twice on the bass strings and 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:12.019
 then the whole guitar 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.019
 to 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.890
 p 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.850
 then we play twice up and 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.690
 once down 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.690
 it would be like this 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:29.909
 ah 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.670
 and that may be one the other option would be 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:40.310
 touch you do not see the bass strings all 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:44.290
 the guitars and do so much that 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.290
 it would be down up down down up 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.980
 is an option would this be 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.330
 the other option would be extra 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:00.790
 and then I'm going to do the agreed network 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.790
 I have to find time 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:12.060
 234 ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:15.750
 every impulse first and I make a tata tata 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:18.390
 watering a data and will of the 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:22.890
 ovens when the king can beat the 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:24.819
 lightning from top to bottom 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.230
 above 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:29.910
 seriousness data 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.530
 and then the sun 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:35.380
 so so 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.900
 or network and another option that I can 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:41.410
 to do is to make the king but with low in 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:44.440
 fa then held the sun that 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:47.350
 I have to raise one towards him 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:52.780
 the sixth string if the second fret 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:55.870
 also and under finger three to the 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.940
 third string second fret this is the 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.550
 the chord of re with under a false 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.590
 stopped 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:04.900
 any day well 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:08.690
 I think that is commensurate gravel feel 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:12.230
 but in live mode the chord of the major re 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:14.250
 well classic then it would be if ta ta 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:17.300
 ta ta 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.300
 ta ta ta 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.240
 while the sun also hands 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.060
 obviously what variations are going to 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.850
 Appear 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:42.210
 in the rhythm if it is serious what is the 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.210
 verse 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.630
 when they are not simply unreal 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:20.939
 and writing is when he starts to say 

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:20.939
 light light light light there is sun 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:34.140
 and he passed the 29th chord 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:37.110
 which is very simple simply do not have to 

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:38.940
 lower these two fingers to the strings of 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:41.130
 down down one finger to the 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:43.680
 fourth string in second fret and bass 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:46.729
 finger two to the fifth string 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.729
 third fret 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.940
 it would be him 

00:05:55.949 --> 00:05:59.880
 9 the soul 

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:12.860
 and when he says wait, alba goes back to the sun 

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:12.860
 it would be two measures in 29 and then the sun 

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:22.090
 occasionally 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.990
 same back 

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:35.810
 and the verse repeats itself again 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:39.680
 the chorus and then we have the part 

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:41.810
 of the sun yes here that would be the part that 

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:44.350
 not that we would miss it when 

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:44.350
 be melody 

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:55.979
 when you go in 12 melodies the chords 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:55.979
 what we do is my minor we accept the sun 

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:07.480
 and less 

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:11.160
 step the lover 

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:14.990
 step around 

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:19.780
 passed to 9 

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:24.920
 and less 

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:35.320
 one full compass minor one complete one 

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:38.460
 full compass on the 

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:38.460
 half compadre 

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:43.060
 I'm going 9 

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:48.600
 and this in the end it does twice well 

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:52.010
 I hope you like this tutorial and we 

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:52.010
 we see in the next video
