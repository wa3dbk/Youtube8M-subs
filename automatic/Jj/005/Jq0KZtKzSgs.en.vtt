00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.470
 warnes in this booth and partners and 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.470
 Welcome to no no 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.350
 I still have not had breakfast and I said 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.350
 against this game it has to be fine 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.350
 He said 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:26.609
 efe 0 but look at what selection of cars 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:27.570
 there is and if it gets to you we're going to 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.390
 kill 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.550
 now let's kill I'm not going to put a 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.290
 banana by the engine and it's going to 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.290
 divert and after that I say everything 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.010
 this is the test 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.710
 here it is 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.110
 because it corrects 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.510
 It has no same as me 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.690

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.260
 I literally 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.600
 I believe that I verify if this case is 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.460
 so slow fokin or is that I am a 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.460
 wanker I no longer track 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:09.930

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:11.960
 cojones but it's fine I'm in fourth 

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.960

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.680
 when you win they give you parts for the 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.940

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.940
