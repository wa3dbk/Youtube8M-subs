turned of corner in that in that one
game<00:00:42.840> I<00:00:42.870> think<00:00:43.140> they<00:00:43.230> might<00:00:43.379> have<00:00:43.410> turned<00:00:43.559> the

game I think they might have turned the

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.190 
game I think they might have turned the
corner<00:00:43.890> Stanford<00:00:44.730> of<00:00:44.820> course<00:00:45.030> is<00:00:45.300> is<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.570> great

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
corner Stanford of course is is a great

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
the spread on the year but a touchdown I

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.040 
the spread on the year but a touchdown I
don't<00:00:50.969> know<00:00:51.030> I<00:00:51.059> think<00:00:51.210> I<00:00:51.449> would<00:00:51.600> lean<00:00:51.750> towards

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
don't know I think I would lean towards

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.350 
don't know I think I would lean towards
Wisconsin<00:00:52.500> getting<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.710> touchdown<00:00:53.039> here<00:00:53.360> yeah

I<00:00:54.390> would<00:00:54.780> too<00:00:54.809> i<00:00:55.050> mean<00:00:55.410> there's<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.710> couple

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
I would too i mean there's a couple

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.709 
I would too i mean there's a couple
things<00:00:56.190> that<00:00:56.489> stand<00:00:56.730> out<00:00:56.969> in<00:00:57.149> my<00:00:57.180> mind<00:00:57.300> with

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
to have success but both teams have

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.770 
to have success but both teams have
really<00:01:19.799> good<00:01:19.950> rush<00:01:20.580> defenses<00:01:21.299> I<00:01:21.509> believe

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
really good rush defenses I believe

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.520 
really good rush defenses I believe
Wisconsin<00:01:22.470> was<00:01:22.590> second<00:01:23.009> in<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.100> big<00:01:23.369> ten<00:01:23.670> and

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
Wisconsin was second in the big ten and

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.950 
Wisconsin was second in the big ten and
top<00:01:25.530> 12<00:01:25.890> nationally<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:26.820> if<00:01:27.630> i'm<00:01:27.780> not

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
top 12 nationally and if i'm not

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.219 
top 12 nationally and if i'm not
mistaken<00:01:28.640> stanford<00:01:29.640> as<00:01:29.790> I<00:01:29.820> think<00:01:30.509> second<00:01:31.110> or

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
mistaken stanford as I think second or

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.140 
mistaken stanford as I think second or
third<00:01:31.439> in<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.680> nation<00:01:31.799> as<00:01:32.159> well<00:01:32.340> so<00:01:33.000> I<00:01:33.030> think

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
third in the nation as well so I think

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.179

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
are inexperienced in this type of

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.760 
are inexperienced in this type of
situation<00:01:41.430> I<00:01:42.299> don't<00:01:42.810> think<00:01:42.899> either<00:01:43.170> team<00:01:43.530> is

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
situation I don't think either team is

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.530 
situation I don't think either team is
really<00:01:43.920> going<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.189> be<00:01:44.340> taking<00:01:44.700> many<00:01:44.880> shots<00:01:45.210> I

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
really going to be taking many shots I

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.120 
really going to be taking many shots I
think<00:01:45.750> you're<00:01:45.840> going<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.049> see<00:01:46.110> field<00:01:46.560> goals<00:01:46.890> I

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
think you're going to see field goals I

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.550 
think you're going to see field goals I
think<00:01:47.579> you're<00:01:47.700> going<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:47.880> see<00:01:47.939> tough<00:01:48.270> Roget<00:01:48.780> I

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
think you're going to see tough Roget I

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.499 
think you're going to see tough Roget I
do<00:01:49.799> like<00:01:50.130> Wisconsin<00:01:50.850> but<00:01:50.970> I<00:01:51.030> also<00:01:51.210> like<00:01:51.479> the

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
do like Wisconsin but I also like the

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.929 
do like Wisconsin but I also like the
under<00:01:51.990> in<00:01:52.110> this<00:01:52.259> game<00:01:52.530> I<00:01:52.740> just<00:01:53.280> don't<00:01:53.579> think

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
under in this game I just don't think

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.480 
under in this game I just don't think
that<00:01:54.030> we're<00:01:54.360> going<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.540> see<00:01:54.810> many<00:01:55.799> explosive

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
that we're going to see many explosive

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.840 
defenses its kind of strength versus
strength<00:02:01.350> is<00:02:01.590> what<00:02:01.770> I'm<00:02:01.860> getting<00:02:02.189> at<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.520> and

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
strength is what I'm getting at and and

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.550 
strength is what I'm getting at and and
neither<00:02:03.000> team<00:02:03.360> really<00:02:03.600> has<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:03.750> passing<00:02:04.380> game

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
neither team really has the passing game

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.880 
neither team really has the passing game
to<00:02:05.450> exploit<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.630> other<00:02:06.750> teams<00:02:07.020> pass<00:02:07.320> defense

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
to exploit the other teams pass defense

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.100 
to exploit the other teams pass defense
though<00:02:08.759> I<00:02:08.789> would<00:02:09.090> lean<00:02:09.239> to<00:02:09.360> Wisconsin<00:02:09.959> with

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
though I would lean to Wisconsin with

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.290 
though I would lean to Wisconsin with
you<00:02:10.319> and<00:02:10.590> I<00:02:10.649> do<00:02:10.709> like<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.129> under<00:02:11.459> ya<00:02:11.849> know<00:02:12.120> it

you and I do like the under ya know it

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.580 
you and I do like the under ya know it
does<00:02:12.450> make<00:02:12.629> sense<00:02:12.660> what<00:02:12.959> about<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.200> fact

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
does make sense what about the fact

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.229 
does make sense what about the fact
consin<00:02:14.010> has<00:02:14.099> not<00:02:14.280> really<00:02:14.519> had<00:02:14.670> that<00:02:14.700> great<00:02:15.060> of

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.309 
the spread in Rose Bowls in in recent
years<00:02:20.090> yeah<00:02:21.090> it's<00:02:21.569> true<00:02:21.810> but<00:02:21.989> they've<00:02:22.170> been

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319

betting<00:02:27.060> stanford<00:02:27.690> one<00:02:27.959> thing<00:02:28.200> has<00:02:28.440> to<00:02:28.650> really

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:28.879 
betting stanford one thing has to really

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:32.869 
betting stanford one thing has to really
resonate<00:02:29.879> with<00:02:30.360> you<00:02:30.860> and<00:02:31.860> that's<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:32.610> fact

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
resonate with you and that's the fact

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.119 
resonate with you and that's the fact
that<00:02:33.060> Johnathan<00:02:33.870> Franklin<00:02:34.019> of<00:02:34.440> UCLA<00:02:34.980> had

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129 
that Johnathan Franklin of UCLA had

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:37.670 
that Johnathan Franklin of UCLA had
nearly<00:02:35.370> 200<00:02:35.970> rushing<00:02:36.180> yards<00:02:36.720> against<00:02:37.440> them<00:02:37.560> in

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
nearly 200 rushing yards against them in

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.000 
nearly 200 rushing yards against them in
the<00:02:38.069> pac-12<00:02:38.610> championship<00:02:39.330> game<00:02:39.569> and<00:02:40.010> that's

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
the pac-12 championship game and that's

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.860 
the pac-12 championship game and that's
just<00:02:41.129> a<00:02:41.310> bit<00:02:41.459> of<00:02:41.580> a<00:02:41.670> surprise<00:02:41.819> given<00:02:42.360> how<00:02:42.599> good

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
just a bit of a surprise given how good

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.229 
just a bit of a surprise given how good
their<00:02:43.019> rush<00:02:43.230> defense<00:02:43.650> has<00:02:43.799> been<00:02:44.150> Wisconsin<00:02:45.150> is

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
their rush defense has been Wisconsin is

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:46.970 
their rush defense has been Wisconsin is
probably<00:02:45.660> better<00:02:45.900> at<00:02:46.170> running<00:02:46.319> the<00:02:46.590> ball<00:02:46.739> than

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
probably better at running the ball than

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.069 
probably better at running the ball than
UCLA<00:02:47.340> they've<00:02:47.849> got<00:02:48.060> still<00:02:48.630> got<00:02:48.780> a<00:02:48.810> great

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079 
UCLA they've got still got a great

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:51.920 
UCLA they've got still got a great
offensive<00:02:49.620> line<00:02:49.860> you<00:02:50.519> know<00:02:50.720> you<00:02:51.720> mentioned

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
offensive line you know you mentioned

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.710 
offensive line you know you mentioned
the<00:02:52.200> Big<00:02:53.010> Ten<00:02:53.250> championship<00:02:53.910> game<00:02:54.150> most

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
the Big Ten championship game most

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.870 
the Big Ten championship game most
people<00:02:55.049> think<00:02:55.230> of<00:02:55.440> a<00:02:55.500> montee<00:02:56.069> ball<00:02:56.099> as<00:02:56.610> being

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
people think of a montee ball as being

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.119 
people think of a montee ball as being
the<00:02:57.030> star<00:02:57.329> but<00:02:57.540> while<00:02:58.170> he<00:02:58.319> had<00:02:58.410> over<00:02:58.680> 200

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129 
the star but while he had over 200

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:00.559 
the star but while he had over 200
rushing<00:02:59.310> yards<00:02:59.730> in<00:02:59.819> that<00:02:59.940> game<00:03:00.150> he<00:03:00.180> wasn't

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
rushing yards in that game he wasn't

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.449 
rushing yards in that game he wasn't
even<00:03:00.629> the<00:03:00.840> leading<00:03:01.110> rusher<00:03:01.260> for<00:03:01.620> Wisconsin<00:03:02.250> so

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
even the leading rusher for Wisconsin so

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.640 
even the leading rusher for Wisconsin so
Wisconsin<00:03:03.450> will<00:03:03.599> find<00:03:03.989> ways<00:03:04.200> to<00:03:04.379> run<00:03:04.530> the

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
Wisconsin will find ways to run the

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.130 
Wisconsin will find ways to run the
football<00:03:04.860> overall<00:03:05.819> conservative<00:03:06.569> game<00:03:06.840> plan

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.650 
football overall conservative game plan
I<00:03:07.349> see<00:03:07.590> for<00:03:07.769> both<00:03:07.920> sides<00:03:08.569> especially<00:03:09.569> with

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.589 
I see for both sides especially with

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
sideline probably a very conservative
