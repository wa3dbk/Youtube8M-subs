00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
one which is under the medical screening

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.830 
one which is under the medical screening
with<00:02:44.840> your<00:02:45.840> constipation<00:02:46.610> analyzing<00:02:47.810> okay<00:02:48.810> I

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
with your constipation analyzing okay I

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.500 
with your constipation analyzing okay I
clear<00:02:49.170> it<00:02:49.350> now<00:02:49.700> you<00:02:50.700> must<00:02:50.850> be<00:02:50.970> pressurizing

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
clear it now you must be pressurizing

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.690 
clear it now you must be pressurizing
means<00:02:52.320> the<00:02:52.440> test<00:02:52.650> so<00:02:53.040> this<00:02:53.460> will<00:02:53.580> be<00:02:53.640> our

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
means the test so this will be our

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.640 
means the test so this will be our
pressure<00:02:53.910> there<00:02:54.210> and<00:02:54.410> you've<00:02:55.410> got<00:02:55.440> the

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
pressure there and you've got the

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.140 
pressure there and you've got the
machine<00:02:55.920> has<00:02:56.070> a<00:02:56.100> real<00:02:56.310> casual<00:02:56.640> Tyrion<00:02:57.030> of

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
machine has a real casual Tyrion of

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.180 
machine has a real casual Tyrion of
course<00:02:57.390> I<00:02:58.140> think<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:58.740> pressure<00:02:58.950> would<00:02:59.070> be

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
course I think the pressure would be

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:06.100 
course I think the pressure would be
quite<00:02:59.370> big

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.050 

we<00:03:06.650> are<00:03:06.740> pretty<00:03:07.010> clear<00:03:07.430> for<00:03:07.700> the<00:03:07.820> caller

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
we are pretty clear for the caller

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.550 
we are pretty clear for the caller
you're<00:03:08.360> quite<00:03:08.570> quite<00:03:08.930> confident<00:03:09.350> in<00:03:09.440> the

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
you're quite quite confident in the

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.320 
you're quite quite confident in the
steps<00:03:10.570> possible<00:03:11.570> for<00:03:12.110> this<00:03:12.200> to<00:03:12.260> do<00:03:13.000> so<00:03:14.000> to<00:03:14.060> be

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
steps possible for this to do so to be

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.690 
steps possible for this to do so to be
in<00:03:14.510> here<00:03:14.750> is<00:03:14.900> definitely<00:03:15.250> mentally<00:03:16.250> straining

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
in here is definitely mentally straining

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.280 
in here is definitely mentally straining
because<00:03:17.000> you<00:03:17.090> need<00:03:17.210> to<00:03:17.360> memorize<00:03:17.510> a<00:03:17.960> lot<00:03:18.110> of

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
because you need to memorize a lot of

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.710 
because you need to memorize a lot of
technical<00:03:18.590> and<00:03:19.400> scientific<00:03:19.880> terms<00:03:20.330> and<00:03:20.570> even

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
technical and scientific terms and even

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080 
among many others a new development what

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:55.809 
among many others a new development what
you<00:05:54.229> see<00:05:54.409> is<00:05:54.469> what<00:05:54.620> you<00:05:54.650> get<00:05:54.860> can<00:05:55.340> you<00:05:55.430> taste<00:05:55.580> it

00:05:55.809 --> 00:05:55.819 
you see is what you get can you taste it

00:05:55.819 --> 00:05:58.480 
you see is what you get can you taste it
rather<00:05:56.090> than<00:05:56.419> blue<00:05:56.690> or<00:05:57.349> your<00:05:57.590> start<00:05:57.889> hearing

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:58.490 
rather than blue or your start hearing

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.450 
rather than blue or your start hearing
or<00:05:58.789> coffee<00:05:59.020> so<00:06:00.020> it's<00:06:00.379> more<00:06:00.710> realistic<00:06:01.069> in<00:06:01.370> a

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:01.460 
or coffee so it's more realistic in a

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:05.709 
or coffee so it's more realistic in a
sense<00:06:03.280> the<00:06:04.280> greatest<00:06:04.639> thing<00:06:04.789> about<00:06:04.819> MSD<00:06:05.479> C<00:06:05.659> is

00:06:05.709 --> 00:06:05.719 
sense the greatest thing about MSD C is

00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:07.990 
sense the greatest thing about MSD C is
that<00:06:06.020> once<00:06:06.620> one<00:06:06.889> when<00:06:07.460> one<00:06:07.580> group<00:06:07.849> is

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.000 
that once one when one group is

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.629 
that once one when one group is
performing<00:06:08.800> the<00:06:09.800> rest<00:06:09.979> of<00:06:10.099> the<00:06:10.190> cadets<00:06:10.490> they

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:10.639 
performing the rest of the cadets they

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:13.330 
performing the rest of the cadets they
will<00:06:10.759> be<00:06:10.909> sitting<00:06:11.509> inside<00:06:11.690> and<00:06:12.340> observing

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:13.340 
will be sitting inside and observing

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:16.300 
will be sitting inside and observing
their<00:06:13.550> their<00:06:14.240> performance<00:06:14.840> after<00:06:15.680> which<00:06:15.949> they

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:16.310 
their their performance after which they

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.730 
their their performance after which they
can<00:06:16.520> comment<00:06:17.240> on<00:06:17.479> the<00:06:17.599> mistakes<00:06:17.990> and<00:06:18.319> the

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:18.740 
can comment on the mistakes and the

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.439 
can comment on the mistakes and the
solutions<00:06:19.580> that<00:06:19.789> they<00:06:19.909> found<00:06:20.060> for<00:06:20.330> those

00:06:20.439 --> 00:06:20.449 
solutions that they found for those

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:22.209 
solutions that they found for those
problems<00:06:20.900> so<00:06:21.469> it's<00:06:21.620> a<00:06:21.710> great<00:06:22.069> learning

00:06:22.209 --> 00:06:22.219 
problems so it's a great learning

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:24.339 
problems so it's a great learning
experience<00:06:22.490> for<00:06:22.909> all<00:06:23.060> of<00:06:23.270> them<00:06:23.419> because<00:06:23.719> they

00:06:24.339 --> 00:06:24.349 
experience for all of them because they

00:06:24.349 --> 00:06:27.149 
experience for all of them because they
get<00:06:24.469> to<00:06:24.620> learn<00:06:24.740> a<00:06:24.800> lot<00:06:25.009> of<00:06:25.190> hands-on<00:06:26.060> skills

00:06:27.149 --> 00:06:27.159 
get to learn a lot of hands-on skills

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:29.740 
get to learn a lot of hands-on skills
nothing<00:06:28.159> will<00:06:28.340> truly<00:06:28.580> replace<00:06:29.000> a<00:06:29.029> real-life

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:29.750 
nothing will truly replace a real-life

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:31.149 
nothing will truly replace a real-life
experience<00:06:30.110> like<00:06:30.500> a<00:06:30.529> hospital<00:06:30.979> or<00:06:31.069> an
