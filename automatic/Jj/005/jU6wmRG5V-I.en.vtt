00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
pieces that were found in the same

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.750 
pieces that were found in the same
excavations<00:00:58.469> that<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.800> gold<00:00:59.010> came<00:00:59.280> from<00:00:59.550> and

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
excavations that the gold came from and

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.139 
excavations that the gold came from and
these<00:01:00.180> haven't<00:01:00.480> received<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.170> same<00:01:01.379> kind<00:01:01.800> of

these haven't received the same kind of
public<00:01:03.149> exposure<00:01:03.539> so<00:01:04.350> this<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:04.979> really

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
public exposure so this is really

public exposure so this is really
something<00:01:05.790> quiet<00:01:06.600> um<00:01:06.960> quite<00:01:07.650> new<00:01:08.210> also<00:01:09.210> we've

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
something quiet um quite new also we've

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.300 
something quiet um quite new also we've
looked<00:01:09.840> at<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.229> term<00:01:10.530> from<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.920> point<00:01:11.070> of<00:01:11.250> view

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
looked at it term from the point of view

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.330 
looked at it term from the point of view
of<00:01:11.460> light<00:01:11.850> what's<00:01:12.510> interested<00:01:13.320> as<00:01:13.470> is<00:01:13.680> the

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
of light what's interested as is the

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.770 
of light what's interested as is the
ability<00:01:15.240> of<00:01:15.509> silver<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.350> reflect<00:01:17.040> light<00:01:17.159> and

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
ability of silver to reflect light and

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.330 
ability of silver to reflect light and
from<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:18.930> once<00:01:19.290> we<00:01:19.470> start<00:01:19.740> moving<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.220> little

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
from that once we start moving a little

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.980 
from that once we start moving a little
bit<00:01:20.490> away<00:01:20.700> from<00:01:20.729> silver<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.570> look<00:01:21.689> at<00:01:21.840> the

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
bit away from silver and look at the

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.170 
bit away from silver and look at the
light<00:01:22.170> reflective<00:01:22.830> qualities<00:01:23.369> it<00:01:23.850> means<00:01:24.090> that

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
light reflective qualities it means that

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.590 
light reflective qualities it means that
we<00:01:24.299> also<00:01:24.509> in<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.049> 18th<00:01:25.439> century<00:01:26.240> 917<00:01:27.240> 15th

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
we also in the 18th century 917 15th

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.560 
we also in the 18th century 917 15th
century<00:01:28.020> we<00:01:28.439> get<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.799> look<00:01:28.950> at<00:01:29.159> paintings<00:01:30.060> that

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
century we get to look at paintings that

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.230 
century we get to look at paintings that
were<00:01:30.630> painted<00:01:31.110> by<00:01:31.140> indigenous<00:01:31.680> people<00:01:32.400> using

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
were painted by indigenous people using

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.230 
were painted by indigenous people using
silver<00:01:33.960> paint<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.740> gold<00:01:35.070> foil<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:36.000> you'll

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
silver paint and gold foil and you'll

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.420 
silver paint and gold foil and you'll
see<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.479> same<00:01:36.900> kind<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.380> luminescent<00:01:38.220> light

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
see that same kind of luminescent light

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.990 
see that same kind of luminescent light
emitting<00:01:38.909> quality<00:01:39.390> in<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:40.229> colonial<00:01:40.650> period

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
emitting quality in the colonial period

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.240 
emitting quality in the colonial period
right<00:01:42.000> up<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.420> today<00:01:42.450> so<00:01:42.780> this<00:01:43.649> ability<00:01:43.979> of

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
right up to today so this ability of

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.730 
right up to today so this ability of
material<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.270> reflect<00:01:45.840> like<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.350> look<00:01:46.470> at<00:01:46.590> if

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
material to reflect like to look at if

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.859 
material to reflect like to look at if
they're<00:01:46.860> emitting<00:01:47.159> light<00:01:47.520> is<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.210> really<00:01:48.630> kind

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
they're emitting light is a really kind

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.289 
they're emitting light is a really kind
of<00:01:49.020> basic<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.649> feta<00:01:50.430> category<00:01:50.970> if<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.149> like

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
of basic a feta category if you like

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.319

that imagination it was also a kind of
Christianity<00:03:36.400> that<00:03:36.760> emphasized<00:03:37.359> that<00:03:37.630> was
