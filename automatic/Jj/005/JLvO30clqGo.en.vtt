I really like is the gear lever is back
where<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:29.670> should<00:01:29.880> be<00:01:29.909> here<00:01:30.390> between<00:01:30.659> the

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
where it should be here between the

where it should be here between the
seats<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.319> not<00:01:31.470> where<00:01:31.860> it<00:01:31.920> used<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.220> be<00:01:32.340> all

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060

the<00:01:33.240> materials<00:01:33.720> everything<00:01:33.990> is<00:01:34.229> so<00:01:34.470> very<00:01:34.830> very

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
the materials everything is so very very

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.120 
the materials everything is so very very
good<00:01:35.490> that<00:01:36.149> it<00:01:36.299> must<00:01:36.569> be<00:01:36.720> said<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.020> this<00:01:37.799> gets

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
good that it must be said that this gets

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.400 
good that it must be said that this gets
very<00:01:38.220> very<00:01:38.789> close<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.239> the<00:01:39.270> s-class<00:01:39.599> they

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:40.410 
very very close to the s-class they

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.130 
very very close to the s-class they
might<00:01:40.590> get<00:01:40.739> worried<00:01:41.069> that<00:01:41.160> Nishida<00:01:41.550> Benz

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
might get worried that Nishida Benz

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.869 
might get worried that Nishida Benz
changes<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.289> the<00:01:43.379> infamous<00:01:43.770> I<00:01:44.009> drive<00:01:44.399> system

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:44.879 
changes to the infamous I drive system

00:01:44.879 --> 00:01:47.300 
changes to the infamous I drive system
are<00:01:45.209> another<00:01:45.569> big<00:01:45.780> improvement<00:01:46.440> it<00:01:47.099> was

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
are another big improvement it was

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.460 
are another big improvement it was
originally<00:01:47.879> designed<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.420> make<00:01:48.720> life<00:01:48.959> easier

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470

by putting all the controls in one place

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.260 
by putting all the controls in one place
but<00:01:52.530> in<00:01:52.770> reality<00:01:52.950> was<00:01:53.640> impossibly

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
but in reality was impossibly

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.809 
but in reality was impossibly
complicated<00:01:54.800> just<00:01:55.800> to<00:01:55.950> turn<00:01:56.129> the<00:01:56.340> heating<00:01:56.550> up

00:01:56.809 --> 00:01:56.819 
complicated just to turn the heating up

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:00.229 
complicated just to turn the heating up
you<00:01:57.090> had<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.360> have<00:01:57.539> a<00:01:57.569> degree<00:01:57.780> in<00:01:57.989> algebra<00:01:59.239> but

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:00.239 
you had to have a degree in algebra but

00:02:00.239 --> 00:02:02.359 
you had to have a degree in algebra but
now<00:02:00.509> that's<00:02:00.810> operated<00:02:01.349> by<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.530> separate<00:02:02.160> set<00:02:02.340> of

the<00:02:18.209> problem<00:02:18.599> with<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:18.750> car<00:02:18.959> of<00:02:19.080> this<00:02:19.230> size<00:02:19.290> is

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
the problem with the car of this size is

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:20.960 
the problem with the car of this size is
that<00:02:19.830> you<00:02:19.920> have<00:02:20.040> to<00:02:20.160> pull<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.550> nose<00:02:20.700> on<00:02:20.879> the

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
that you have to pull the nose on the

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.759 
that you have to pull the nose on the
junction<00:02:21.300> really<00:02:21.720> onto<00:02:22.050> the<00:02:22.170> road<00:02:22.319> before<00:02:22.500> you

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
junction really onto the road before you

has<00:02:25.440> solved<00:02:25.769> this<00:02:25.860> by<00:02:26.069> putting<00:02:26.580> two<00:02:26.879> sideway

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450
