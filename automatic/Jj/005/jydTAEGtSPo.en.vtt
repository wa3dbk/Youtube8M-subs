in<00:02:04.009> so<00:02:05.009> when<00:02:05.369> you<00:02:05.490> line<00:02:06.060> them<00:02:06.210> up<00:02:06.299> point<00:02:06.810> to

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
in so when you line them up point to

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.520 
in so when you line them up point to
point<00:02:07.259> you're<00:02:07.920> going<00:02:08.040> to<00:02:08.100> go<00:02:08.250> slightly<00:02:08.640> in<00:02:09.530> so

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
point you're going to go slightly in so

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.590 
point you're going to go slightly in so
you<00:02:10.619> can<00:02:10.829> see<00:02:10.979> we've<00:02:11.130> got<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.489> points<00:02:12.030> just

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
you can see we've got the points just

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.720 
you can see we've got the points just
slightly<00:02:13.019> in<00:02:13.230> and<00:02:13.530> then<00:02:13.950> this<00:02:14.070> little<00:02:14.280> curvy

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
slightly in and then this little curvy

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.930 
slightly in and then this little curvy
part<00:02:14.970> is<00:02:15.709> lining<00:02:16.709> up<00:02:16.799> to<00:02:17.100> the<00:02:17.220> point<00:02:17.549> there

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
part is lining up to the point there

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.320 
part is lining up to the point there
because<00:02:18.239> you<00:02:18.480> want<00:02:18.630> these<00:02:18.870> to<00:02:19.230> touch<00:02:20.010> on<00:02:20.370> this

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
because you want these to touch on this

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.050 
because you want these to touch on this
part<00:02:21.629> they<00:02:22.230> don't<00:02:22.410> have<00:02:22.620> to<00:02:22.800> overlap<00:02:23.280> the

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
part they don't have to overlap the

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.390 
part they don't have to overlap the
first<00:02:24.090> one<00:02:24.480> I<00:02:24.510> made<00:02:24.780> I<00:02:24.840> was<00:02:25.230> overlapping<00:02:25.890> them

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
first one I made I was overlapping them

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.690 
first one I made I was overlapping them
and<00:02:26.489> the<00:02:27.209> tree<00:02:27.480> was<00:02:27.590> actually<00:02:28.590> a<00:02:28.769> little<00:02:29.069> short

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
and the tree was actually a little short

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.789 
and the tree was actually a little short
and<00:02:29.909> wide<00:02:30.420> and<00:02:30.840> it<00:02:31.019> didn't<00:02:31.230> look<00:02:31.319> as<00:02:31.470> well<00:02:31.650> so

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
and wide and it didn't look as well so

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:34.520 
and wide and it didn't look as well so
you<00:02:31.890> want<00:02:32.370> to<00:02:32.430> kind<00:02:32.580> of<00:02:32.870> elongate<00:02:33.870> this<00:02:34.110> tree<00:02:34.500> a

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
you want to kind of elongate this tree a

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.420 
you want to kind of elongate this tree a
little<00:02:34.709> bit<00:02:34.980> so<00:02:35.640> it<00:02:35.790> fits<00:02:35.819> on<00:02:36.209> the<00:02:36.360> card<00:02:36.599> and

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
little bit so it fits on the card and

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.500 
little bit so it fits on the card and
then<00:02:38.430> you<00:02:38.519> just<00:02:38.730> keep<00:02:38.849> going<00:02:39.150> all<00:02:39.299> the<00:02:39.480> way

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
then you just keep going all the way

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.780 
then you just keep going all the way
down<00:02:39.780> so<00:02:40.049> again<00:02:40.349> you<00:02:40.890> can<00:02:41.069> line<00:02:41.250> up<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.430> point

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
down so again you can line up the point

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.839 
down so again you can line up the point
to<00:02:41.940> point<00:02:41.970> and<00:02:42.540> then<00:02:43.230> go<00:02:43.260> slightly<00:02:43.829> under<00:02:44.579> and

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
to point and then go slightly under and

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:46.819 
to point and then go slightly under and
see<00:02:45.209> how<00:02:45.360> that<00:02:45.420> touches<00:02:46.079> in<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:46.379> middle<00:02:46.620> and

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
see how that touches in the middle and

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:49.569 
see how that touches in the middle and
then<00:02:47.670> this<00:02:47.760> one's<00:02:48.000> gonna<00:02:48.120> go<00:02:48.299> right<00:02:48.569> here<00:02:48.959> and

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:49.579 
then this one's gonna go right here and

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:57.619 
then this one's gonna go right here and
these<00:02:50.579> points<00:02:51.000> are<00:02:51.480> gonna<00:02:51.659> go<00:02:51.840> right<00:02:52.230> under<00:02:56.629> so

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:57.629 
these points are gonna go right under so

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:59.059 
these points are gonna go right under so
again<00:02:57.900> you<00:02:58.049> can<00:02:58.200> see<00:02:58.379> the<00:02:58.530> points<00:02:58.859> of<00:02:58.980> the

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
again you can see the points of the

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.759 
again you can see the points of the
mosaic<00:02:59.579> are<00:03:00.329> just<00:03:00.660> slightly<00:03:00.959> under<00:03:01.140> and<00:03:02.599> off

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
mosaic are just slightly under and off

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:08.000 
mosaic are just slightly under and off
to<00:03:04.769> the<00:03:04.890> ones<00:03:05.099> on<00:03:05.310> top<00:03:05.549> and<00:03:06.359> just<00:03:07.349> continue<00:03:07.829> all

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
to the ones on top and just continue all

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.940 
to the ones on top and just continue all
the<00:03:08.160> way<00:03:08.250> down<00:03:12.319> we're<00:03:13.319> going<00:03:13.470> to<00:03:13.530> stamp<00:03:13.799> a

the way down we're going to stamp a

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.069 
the way down we're going to stamp a
greeting<00:03:13.980> this<00:03:14.760> is<00:03:14.940> from<00:03:15.090> a<00:03:15.209> stamp<00:03:15.450> set<00:03:15.659> called

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
part of a three punch pack we're going

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.809 
part of a three punch pack we're going
to<00:03:45.060> snip<00:03:45.269> just<00:03:45.540> a<00:03:45.660> tiny<00:03:45.959> little<00:03:46.859> dimensional

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
to snip just a tiny little dimensional

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:54.819 
to snip just a tiny little dimensional
here<00:03:48.180> for<00:03:48.450> the<00:03:48.540> back<00:03:48.690> of<00:03:48.720> that<00:03:48.870> star

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:57.470 

it's<00:03:55.829> actually<00:03:56.159> the<00:03:56.249> perfect<00:03:56.489> size<00:03:56.909> I'm<00:03:57.329> going

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
it's actually the perfect size I'm going

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.459 
it's actually the perfect size I'm going
to<00:03:57.540> put<00:03:57.629> it<00:03:57.719> right<00:03:57.900> about<00:03:58.290> here<00:03:59.099> so<00:04:00.469> we're

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:01.469 
to put it right about here so we're

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:03.830 
to put it right about here so we're
gonna<00:04:01.560> use<00:04:01.650> the<00:04:01.980> tiniest<00:04:02.510> rhinestones<00:04:03.510> and

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
gonna use the tiniest rhinestones and

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.559 
gonna use the tiniest rhinestones and
these<00:04:04.290> are<00:04:04.499> actually<00:04:04.889> all<00:04:04.920> connected<00:04:05.670> and<00:04:05.969> I

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:06.569 
these are actually all connected and I

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:10.369 
these are actually all connected and I
used<00:04:07.319> scissors<00:04:07.739> to<00:04:08.310> slice<00:04:09.030> between<00:04:09.629> them<00:04:09.840> so

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:10.379 
used scissors to slice between them so

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:11.959 
used scissors to slice between them so
that<00:04:10.530> way<00:04:10.650> it<00:04:10.739> separates<00:04:11.159> the<00:04:11.280> adhesive<00:04:11.790> and

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:11.969 
that way it separates the adhesive and

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:14.240 
that way it separates the adhesive and
then<00:04:12.780> I<00:04:12.840> can<00:04:13.079> use<00:04:13.230> them<00:04:13.439> individually<00:04:13.709> so<00:04:14.189> I'm

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
then I can use them individually so I'm

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:15.319 
then I can use them individually so I'm
just<00:04:14.430> gonna<00:04:14.519> put<00:04:14.760> them<00:04:14.879> right<00:04:15.060> in<00:04:15.209> the<00:04:15.299> center

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
just gonna put them right in the center

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:22.879 
just gonna put them right in the center
and<00:04:15.719> press<00:04:16.199> that<00:04:16.380> down<00:04:21.440> and<00:04:22.440> the<00:04:22.530> last<00:04:22.650> thing

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 
and press that down and the last thing

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:24.680
