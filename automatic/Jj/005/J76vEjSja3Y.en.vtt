00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 hello beatriz good evening we are 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.089
 us in street arturo ureta with the 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.470
 arcÃ¡ngel the commune of vitacura I am going to 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.240
 make a side for you to see the 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.730
 images that speak for themselves 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.410
 this is the building the archangel that 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.929
 built the constructors and for 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.270
 as you can see collapse is a 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.430
 six - storey building of which 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.800
 five collapsed in the way that 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.830
 you are seeing it now this was 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.279
 around seven thirty in the afternoon and 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.050
 luckily I must say people were already going 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.300
 departure many of them were still 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.579
 on the top floor but on the other end 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.469
 therefore there are no injuries or civilians 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.180
 no workers to regret 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.910
 no bystanders who have gone 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.219
 circulating in that place have had to 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.190
 regret any injury in this minute 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.260
 is firefighters working to check 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.520
 next to the calculator engineer of the 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.739
 company that is in the place 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.140
 also to verify and verify what 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.270
 what went wrong and what were the 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.430
 causes of this collapse we 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.109
 we were looking to converse with none of the 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.579
 neighbors who could see everything that happened 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.570
 silvana silvana good afternoon what was it 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.970
 what happened if you can tell us why 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.720
 look at me it 's so unfair when you felt 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.490
 those people 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.560
 the noise began to crumble in the 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.990
 middle zone this was the first 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.810
 it fell and well this fatigue fell 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.630
 five floors and avoided the fall were the 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.120
 workers up the showers like this 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.500
 they reached out and I stayed here 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.720
 looking and 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.940
 the dust that rises 0 before a powder 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.590
 just right in the middle everything fell down to 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.730
 today this builder is some 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.460
 neighbors told me that he already had problems 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:34.740
 one of the posts was thrown down during 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.770
 the week that yes we already had several 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.810
 events until you reach it 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.280
 a non- sporting source what happens that 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.250
 they build a lot very fast 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:49.150
 for work schedules and apparently 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:54.729
 there is a childhood error to material but the 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:57.400
 true as silvano grace good there 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.690
 is the information seemingly fatigue 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.340
 material but that will have to say 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.380
