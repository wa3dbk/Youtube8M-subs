00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 there were youtube people welcome a 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.790
 time more to the channel cesar jebe tutorials and 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.220
 this new video I will be presenting you 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.389
 a new recovery for the device 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.389
 400 energy 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.760
 and good this time I come to you 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:23.860
 present a tour as well 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.200
 say it modified by a shock it 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.119
 called eric farías is a recovery that we 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.520
 will help then if your recovery by 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.079
 example has seen several comments me 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.510
 have you told several people that your recovery 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:35.920
 sometimes it does not make whites who are a 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.579
 when installing a rom that you 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.589
 delete junk files now 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.289
 because sometimes he does not do them or that sometimes 

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:44.909
 can not start can not install the 

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:47.539
 roms then our occasion is going to 

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:50.609
 present this recovery that is edited 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:53.579
 and what can this assumption you can 

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:55.649
 fix the hours and problems with 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.299
 the record and that has its ok this record 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.559
 and they will download it from the 

00:00:57.299 --> 00:01:00.629
 description of the video here I am going to 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.180
 leave the links once downloaded 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.090
 they pass like that without decompressing your card 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.039
 They are in a folder or in the 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.659
 root ok and once this is done we are going to 

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:12.450
 start from our device the 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.210
 recovery mode it is worth emphasizing that 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.880
 install this recovery will not be you 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.799
 eliminating nothing will simply change 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.069
 the recovery and also say that when 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.929
 install some other rom if not then it 

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:26.759
 it will change the recovery by the recovery 

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:28.560
 normal then back you'll have to 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.450
 re-flashing what this recovery is 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.250
 install without needing to do any 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.380
 wipe let's go first to this one 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.049
 decide from sd card after wide 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.459
 encrypt sd card for this and we're going to 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.229
 scroll with the volume keys or 

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:42.360
 up volume down and let's give ok 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.880
 with this we are going to go down with 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.750
 Menu key and up with home key 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:51.360
 then a sdk and we will look for what 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.659
 they would come being this one the recovery 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.329
 which is called is called recovery molds 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.780
 that as I say is edited by eric and 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.850
 We will give in 10 install 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.350
 well we are not just going to wait 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.180
 as you see, they have already finished 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.850
 now let's give the robot again 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:11.030
 we're going to go there where it says install 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.730
 sdk cintrón we will not go back we will 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.680
 go 'advanced 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.900
 and here we will see where the reboot says 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.849
 recovery as well as we will not give it 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.440
 here and now we are simply going to wait 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:21.909
 to restart us again in what 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.800
 it would be the recovery mode 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:25.540
 automatically 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.980
 and good as you see called reboot the 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.960
 travel in principle do not notice 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.790
 many changes after is practically 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:34.120
 the same is the same as what would be 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.920
 the aesthetics of the recovery although if 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.800
 that gets to differentiate and know that 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.420
 we already have it installed is that from here 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.060
 in the background tells us it reaches to notice the 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.010
 camera is that it brings as a picture a 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.170
 logo that says the club work mod 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.420
 the mode is what looks the biggest is 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.530
 like a guy mesh what good with this 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.900
 they will differentiate that they already have 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:56.360
 installed the edited recovery of eric ok 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.610
 as i say this recovery is going to help 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.500
 so to avoid having errors in what 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.510
 would be the whites at the time of 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.690
 doing a wave will do them correctly 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.880
 also if they have this recovery to the 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.850
 time to install then where it says wild 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:13.010
 talking cache with this recovery this one already 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:16.070
 will not be will not give them the error either 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.270
 once will be enough to do this 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.280
 be equal we will not have to do it 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.680
 three times and I emphasize when you 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.260
 install a new rome usually 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.670
 the roms do not bring this recovery then 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.950
 when you exist in that area 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.320
 it will automatically cover it 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.300
 replaced by the recovery then normal 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.250
 So if you want it 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:37.220
 get back to having then simply do the 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.750
 same installation process ok and so 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.970
 as we would like the video basically 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.410
 today I hope you liked it 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.420
 forget to give me a good I like this 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.940
 video then to help the community to 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:50.000
