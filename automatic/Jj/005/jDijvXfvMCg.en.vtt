now if you look I've already strung a

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.810 
now if you look I've already strung a
bead<00:00:23.220> here<00:00:24.230> because<00:00:25.230> my<00:00:25.439> not<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:26.220> way<00:00:26.340> I<00:00:26.369> do<00:00:26.519> it

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
I'd like it to come after the bead in

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.749 
I'd like it to come after the bead in
the<00:00:29.340> gap<00:00:29.580> that's<00:00:30.390> going<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.779> set<00:00:31.230> between<00:00:31.439> the

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
bead in the next so that way when I do

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.459 
bead in the next so that way when I do
my<00:00:35.550> next<00:00:35.610> row<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.420> next<00:00:36.809> bead<00:00:36.989> will<00:00:37.110> sit<00:00:37.320> on

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
my next row the next bead will sit on

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.380 
my next row the next bead will sit on
the<00:00:37.649> knot<00:00:38.000> so<00:00:39.000> again<00:00:39.480> I've<00:00:39.899> already<00:00:40.020> got<00:00:40.350> this

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.090 
called a larks head it's a very easy
knot<00:00:56.129> just<00:00:56.670> double<00:00:57.000> your<00:00:57.230> thread<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.500> bend<00:00:58.980> it

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100

down<00:00:59.160> on<00:00:59.489> itself<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.230> that's<00:01:01.230> going<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.500> give

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
down on itself and that's going to give

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.750 
down on itself and that's going to give
you<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:02.129> loop<00:01:03.949> now<00:01:04.949> I'm<00:01:05.129> going<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.369> take<00:01:05.549> the

you a loop now I'm going to take the

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.969 
you a loop now I'm going to take the
original<00:01:06.540> thread<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.080> run<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.650> through<00:01:07.680> the

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
original thread and run it through the

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.390 
original thread and run it through the
larks<00:01:08.250> head<00:01:08.659> and<00:01:09.740> then<00:01:10.740> all<00:01:10.860> I<00:01:10.920> have<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.159> do<00:01:11.280> is

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
larks head and then all I have to do is

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.760 
larks head and then all I have to do is
just<00:01:11.520> tighten<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:12.330> larks<00:01:12.600> head<00:01:12.689> on<00:01:12.960> it<00:01:13.140> at

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
just tighten the larks head on it at

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.410 
just tighten the larks head on it at
this<00:01:13.890> point<00:01:14.220> this<00:01:14.369> will<00:01:14.549> slide<00:01:14.820> all<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.119> way

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
this point this will slide all the way

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.660 
this point this will slide all the way
down<00:01:15.509> up<00:01:16.500> against<00:01:16.950> that<00:01:17.100> bead<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.549> I've

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
down up against that bead that I've

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.719 
down up against that bead that I've
already<00:01:17.850> threaded<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:18.860> then<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.250> last<00:01:20.490> thing

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
already threaded and then the last thing

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.810 
already threaded and then the last thing
I'm<00:01:20.850> going<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.030> do<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.360> lock<00:01:21.509> that<00:01:21.780> knot<00:01:22.020> in<00:01:22.290> is

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
I'm going to do to lock that knot in is

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.120 
I'm going to do to lock that knot in is
to<00:01:23.820> do<00:01:24.540> an<00:01:24.689> overhand<00:01:25.170> knot<00:01:25.290> with<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.650> original

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
to do an overhand knot with the original

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.160 
to do an overhand knot with the original
thread<00:01:26.430> that's<00:01:27.240> left<00:01:27.540> over<00:01:27.689> from<00:01:27.840> the

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
thread that's left over from the

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.950 
thread that's left over from the
beadwork<00:01:28.380> already<00:01:28.860> on<00:01:29.070> there<00:01:29.310> so<00:01:30.240> one<00:01:30.720> simple

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
beadwork already on there so one simple

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.679 
beadwork already on there so one simple
overhand<00:01:31.970> pulling<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.060> down<00:01:33.240> will<00:01:33.420> pull<00:01:33.600> it

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
overhand pulling it down will pull it

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:34.910 
overhand pulling it down will pull it
all<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.810> way<00:01:33.960> up<00:01:34.049> against<00:01:34.439> that<00:01:34.530> larks<00:01:34.829> head

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
all the way up against that larks head

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.969 
all the way up against that larks head
and<00:01:35.159> lock<00:01:35.340> that<00:01:35.369> in<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:36.060> so<00:01:36.900> now<00:01:37.110> I've<00:01:37.530> got<00:01:37.799> the

to<00:01:47.220> because<00:01:48.180> as<00:01:48.360> I<00:01:48.479> continue<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:48.990> do<00:01:49.229> my<00:01:49.380> bead

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
to because as I continue to do my bead

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.859 
to because as I continue to do my bead
work<00:01:49.649> down<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.280> piece<00:01:50.490> it's<00:01:51.299> going<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.600> lock

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
work down the piece it's going to lock

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.499 
work down the piece it's going to lock
in<00:01:52.110> that<00:01:52.350> thread<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.670> when<00:01:54.000> I<00:01:54.030> get<00:01:54.149> kind<00:01:54.450> of

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
in that thread and when I get kind of

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.969 
in that thread and when I get kind of
closer<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.020> end<00:01:55.140> I'll<00:01:55.290> just<00:01:55.470> trim<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:55.829> off

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
closer to the end I'll just trim it off

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.760 
closer to the end I'll just trim it off
and<00:01:56.009> then<00:01:56.369> finish<00:01:56.880> my<00:01:57.030> bead<00:01:57.270> work<00:01:57.320> so<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:58.530> now

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
and then finish my bead work so that now

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.999 
and then finish my bead work so that now
means<00:01:59.070> that<00:01:59.310> all<00:01:59.520> I<00:01:59.549> have<00:01:59.790> to<00:01:59.909> do<00:02:00.090> is<00:02:00.799> take<00:02:01.799> this

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
means that all I have to do is take this

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:07.059 
means that all I have to do is take this
