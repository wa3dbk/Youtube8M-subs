the cheap shop and I've got it under a
thermostat<00:00:23.130> as<00:00:23.640> I've<00:00:24.570> got<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:24.750> heat<00:00:24.990> map<00:00:25.199> in

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
thermostat as I've got a heat map in

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.330 
thermostat as I've got a heat map in
here<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:27.109> the<00:00:28.109> heat<00:00:28.710> map<00:00:28.890> was<00:00:29.070> only

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
here and the heat map was only

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.299 
here and the heat map was only
originally<00:00:29.730> afforded<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.859> that<00:00:31.859> went<00:00:32.070> on<00:00:32.279> for

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
originally afforded and that went on for

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.600 
originally afforded and that went on for
about<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.640> week<00:00:33.000> and<00:00:33.770> it<00:00:34.770> sort<00:00:35.040> of<00:00:35.160> it<00:00:35.430> was<00:00:35.579> on

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
about a week and it sort of it was on

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.979 
about a week and it sort of it was on
constantly<00:00:36.420> so<00:00:37.020> then<00:00:37.260> I<00:00:37.290> bought<00:00:37.620> this<00:00:38.989> this

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
constantly so then I bought this this

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.709 
constantly so then I bought this this
heat<00:00:40.350> table<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.070> I<00:00:41.160> just<00:00:41.510> wrapped<00:00:42.510> around

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
heat table and I just wrapped around

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.959 
heat table and I just wrapped around
inside<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.559> box<00:00:43.770> if<00:00:44.250> you<00:00:44.399> can<00:00:44.520> see<00:00:44.700> all<00:00:44.850> that

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
inside the box if you can see all that

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.200 
inside the box if you can see all that
heat<00:00:45.180> cable<00:00:45.539> there<00:00:45.770> and<00:00:46.770> originally<00:00:47.399> well<00:00:48.120> I'm

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
heat cable there and originally well I'm

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.200 
heat cable there and originally well I'm
outside<00:00:48.539> now<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.200> it's<00:00:49.860> all<00:00:50.010> turned<00:00:50.219> off<00:00:50.460> but

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
outside now and it's all turned off but

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.590 
outside now and it's all turned off but
originally<00:00:52.010> this<00:00:53.010> heat<00:00:53.309> map<00:00:53.520> down<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.239> bottom

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
originally this heat map down the bottom

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.500 
originally this heat map down the bottom
here<00:00:54.980> and<00:00:55.980> I've<00:00:56.219> got<00:00:56.370> about<00:00:56.489> germination<00:00:57.180> you

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
here and I've got about germination you

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.510 
here and I've got about germination you
know<00:00:57.600> there<00:00:57.719> are<00:00:57.780> six<00:00:58.079> days<00:00:58.379> it's<00:00:59.190> running

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
know there are six days it's running

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.930 
know there are six days it's running
about<00:00:59.730> 25<00:01:00.719> degrees<00:01:01.579> constant<00:01:02.579> which<00:01:02.760> is

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
about 25 degrees constant which is

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.390 
about 25 degrees constant which is
probably<00:01:03.690> about<00:01:03.780> just<00:01:04.379> under<00:01:04.500> 80<00:01:04.890> degrees

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
probably about just under 80 degrees

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.609 
probably about just under 80 degrees
Fahrenheit<00:01:06.110> and<00:01:07.790> the<00:01:08.790> process<00:01:09.299> was<00:01:09.600> I<00:01:10.110> had

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
Fahrenheit and the process was I had

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.280 
Fahrenheit and the process was I had
some<00:01:11.159> good<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.580> bad<00:01:11.790> I<00:01:12.090> planted<00:01:12.570> two<00:01:12.810> seeds<00:01:13.140> in

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
some good and bad I planted two seeds in

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.649 
some good and bad I planted two seeds in
each<00:01:13.500> peat<00:01:13.890> pellet<00:01:14.280> down<00:01:14.460> there<00:01:14.640> as<00:01:15.390> you're

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
each peat pellet down there as you're

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:16.010 
each peat pellet down there as you're
gonna<00:01:15.750> see

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
gonna see

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.580 
gonna see
and<00:01:16.860> I<00:01:17.820> pretty<00:01:18.330> much<00:01:18.420> got<00:01:18.900> I've<00:01:19.229> got<00:01:19.409> many

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
and I pretty much got I've got many

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.499 
and I pretty much got I've got many

Trinidad's here I've got the Jolokia is

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.749 
Trinidad's here I've got the Jolokia is
there<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.140> habanero<00:01:22.619> is<00:01:22.710> there<00:01:22.950> that<00:01:23.640> was

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
bottom here I had a they come fan which

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.819 
bottom here I had a they come fan which
was<00:01:47.250> control<00:01:47.820> just<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.180> old<00:01:48.450> cheap<00:01:48.750> USB<00:01:48.990> fan<00:01:49.530> and

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
was control just a old cheap USB fan and

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.100 
was control just a old cheap USB fan and
as<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.189> can<00:01:50.280> see<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.909> fans<00:01:51.210> are<00:01:51.450> there<00:01:51.659> and

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
as you can see the fans are there and

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.109 
as you can see the fans are there and
that's<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.710> timer<00:01:53.310> that<00:01:53.640> course<00:01:53.939> what<00:01:54.090> I

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
that's the timer that course what I

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.800 
that's the timer that course what I
found<00:01:54.540> been<00:01:55.049> at<00:01:55.229> 25<00:01:55.770> degrees<00:01:56.329> every<00:01:57.329> day<00:01:57.540> are

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
found been at 25 degrees every day are

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.870 
found been at 25 degrees every day are
just<00:01:57.840> getting<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.229> bit<00:01:58.350> dried<00:01:58.619> out<00:01:58.860> so<00:01:59.640> I'll<00:01:59.700> put

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
just getting a bit dried out so I'll put

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.889 
just getting a bit dried out so I'll put
the<00:01:59.969> fan<00:02:00.240> in<00:02:00.420> there<00:02:01.340> and<00:02:02.340> what<00:02:03.119> I<00:02:03.149> do<00:02:03.299> at<00:02:03.750> the

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
the fan in there and what I do at the

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:04.639

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:13.800 
the process of what they're all like the
yeah<00:02:11.439> I<00:02:11.739> had<00:02:12.340> a<00:02:12.370> pretty<00:02:12.609> good<00:02:12.790> run<00:02:12.999> so<00:02:13.269> far<00:02:13.299> and

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
yeah I had a pretty good run so far and

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.050 
yeah I had a pretty good run so far and
because<00:02:14.260> I<00:02:14.409> live<00:02:14.560> in<00:02:14.590> Australia<00:02:15.040> here<00:02:15.400> it<00:02:15.909> is

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
because I live in Australia here it is

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.500 
because I live in Australia here it is
winter<00:02:16.480> and<00:02:17.079> it<00:02:17.499> does<00:02:18.010> get<00:02:18.189> turn<00:02:18.400> about<00:02:18.670> eight

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
winter and it does get turn about eight

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.599 
winter and it does get turn about eight
degrees<00:02:19.989> 10<00:02:20.379> degrees<00:02:20.409> at<00:02:20.950> night<00:02:21.129> which<00:02:21.430> is

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:21.609 
degrees 10 degrees at night which is

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:24.929 
degrees 10 degrees at night which is
probably<00:02:21.939> thought<00:02:22.180> that<00:02:22.239> about<00:02:23.370> 20<00:02:24.370> 20

00:02:24.929 --> 00:02:24.939 
probably thought that about 20 20

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:29.670 
probably thought that about 20 20
Fahrenheit<00:02:25.499> and<00:02:26.499> here's<00:02:27.180> is<00:02:28.180> the<00:02:28.239> plants<00:02:28.959> for
