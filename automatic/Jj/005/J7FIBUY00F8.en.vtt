00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.160 
this is a first example game when they
eventually<00:02:04.680> released<00:02:05.280> a<00:02:05.460> game<00:02:05.640> engine

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
eventually released a game engine

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.749 
eventually released a game engine
this<00:02:07.369> maybe<00:02:08.369> next<00:02:08.700> year<00:02:08.970> maybe<00:02:09.030> I<00:02:09.899> don't<00:02:10.080> know

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
this maybe next year maybe I don't know

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.699 
this maybe next year maybe I don't know
maybe<00:02:10.970> a<00:02:11.239> year<00:02:11.450> and<00:02:11.569> a<00:02:11.629> half<00:02:11.720> now<00:02:11.750> -<00:02:12.080> yes<00:02:12.470> I'm

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
maybe a year and a half now - yes I'm

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.190 
maybe a year and a half now - yes I'm
Alice<00:02:13.390> whenever<00:02:14.390> they<00:02:14.540> do<00:02:14.599> release<00:02:14.959> it

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
Alice whenever they do release it

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.309 
Alice whenever they do release it
they'll<00:02:15.890> also<00:02:16.069> be<00:02:16.340> releasing<00:02:16.670> the<00:02:17.569> source

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
they'll also be releasing the source

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:21.699 
they'll also be releasing the source
code<00:02:18.620> they<00:02:18.980> used<00:02:19.340> to<00:02:19.700> create<00:02:20.060> this<00:02:20.299> game<00:02:20.709> that

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
code they used to create this game that

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.190 
code they used to create this game that
wheelies<00:02:22.220> in<00:02:22.370> that<00:02:22.489> along<00:02:22.730> with<00:02:22.790> it<00:02:23.200> and

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
wheelies in that along with it and

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.229 
wheelies in that along with it and
they're<00:02:24.769> actually<00:02:25.159> making<00:02:25.280> a<00:02:25.489> second<00:02:25.879> game<00:02:26.030> -

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
they're actually making a second game -

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.780 
they're actually making a second game -
after<00:02:26.810> this<00:02:26.959> before<00:02:27.890> they<00:02:28.190> release<00:02:28.459> the<00:02:28.640> game

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
after this before they release the game

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.729 
after this before they release the game
engine<00:02:28.970> so<00:02:29.269> this<00:02:29.420> is<00:02:29.599> the<00:02:29.780> first<00:02:30.049> one<00:02:30.349> that's<00:02:30.560> a

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
engine so this is the first one that's a

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.190 
engine so this is the first one that's a
2-d<00:02:31.099> one<00:02:31.569> they<00:02:32.569> actually<00:02:32.780> trying<00:02:32.900> to<00:02:32.959> get<00:02:33.049> this

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
2-d one they actually trying to get this

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.649 
2-d one they actually trying to get this
on<00:02:33.349> steam<00:02:33.379> so<00:02:33.799> I<00:02:33.829> can<00:02:33.980> actually<00:02:34.099> both<00:02:34.659> on

00:02:35.649 --> 00:02:35.659 
on steam so I can actually both on

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:38.289 
on steam so I can actually both on
greenlight<00:02:36.200> to<00:02:36.349> get<00:02:36.500> this<00:02:36.620> on<00:02:36.799> steam<00:02:37.299> but

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:38.299 
greenlight to get this on steam but

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:42.520 
greenlight to get this on steam but
basically<00:02:38.629> that<00:02:38.769> that<00:02:40.629> this<00:02:41.629> is<00:02:41.780> a<00:02:41.810> 2d<00:02:42.290> version

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
basically that that this is a 2d version

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.619 
basically that that this is a 2d version
this<00:02:42.890> is<00:02:42.950> a<00:02:43.099> 2-d<00:02:43.459> game<00:02:43.489> the<00:02:44.090> next<00:02:44.239> game<00:02:44.510> is

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:44.629 
this is a 2-d game the next game is

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:48.009 
this is a 2-d game the next game is
going<00:02:44.780> to<00:02:44.870> be<00:02:45.079> a<00:02:45.109> 3d<00:02:45.790> persistent<00:02:46.790> world<00:02:47.019> sort

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
going to be a 3d persistent world sort

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:50.050 
going to be a 3d persistent world sort
of<00:02:48.079> like<00:02:48.200> an<00:02:48.319> MMO<00:02:48.709> but<00:02:48.739> nothing<00:02:49.609> too<00:02:49.819> serious

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
of like an MMO but nothing too serious

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.680 
of like an MMO but nothing too serious
and<00:02:51.340> they'll<00:02:52.340> be<00:02:52.459> they'll<00:02:52.970> be<00:02:53.120> releasing<00:02:53.450> the

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
and they'll be they'll be releasing the

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.319 
and they'll be they'll be releasing the
source<00:02:53.900> code<00:02:54.109> for<00:02:54.260> that<00:02:54.409> as<00:02:54.620> well<00:02:54.829> and<00:02:55.329> I'm

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:56.329 
source code for that as well and I'm

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:58.149 
source code for that as well and I'm
quite<00:02:56.540> interested<00:02:56.810> and<00:02:57.260> going<00:02:57.799> over<00:02:57.950> all<00:02:58.099> the
