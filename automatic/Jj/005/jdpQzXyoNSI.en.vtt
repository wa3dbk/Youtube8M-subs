you'd think with all that Nutella and

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.360 
you'd think with all that Nutella and
sugar<00:03:23.510> this<00:03:24.170> would<00:03:24.350> be<00:03:24.470> really<00:03:24.830> sickly<00:03:25.100> sweet

but<00:03:26.239> the<00:03:26.360> cream<00:03:26.630> cheese<00:03:26.660> really<00:03:27.260> balances

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
but the cream cheese really balances

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.090 
but the cream cheese really balances
there<00:03:28.010> so<00:03:28.820> it's<00:03:29.420> not<00:03:29.630> overly<00:03:30.049> sweet<00:03:30.170> but<00:03:30.980> it's

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
there so it's not overly sweet but it's

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.970 
there so it's not overly sweet but it's
definitely<00:03:31.280> got<00:03:31.549> that<00:03:31.730> lovely<00:03:31.970> chocolate
