00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:06.630
 law 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:08.589
 wrongly granted port 

00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:11.179
 small village of southern italy 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:13.549
 the inhabitants put in the balance 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:15.369
 everything they have 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:17.669
 work 

00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:20.739
 name of god the power 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:33.100
 the bet is lost 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.120
 Mischief 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.120
 charm 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.190
 the wealth 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.160
 as far as they are concerned 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.890
 that's where roger vailland price goncourt 1957 located the action of his 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.160
 last novel 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.940
 the law 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.940
 she 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.020
 she is cruel 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.940
 all the more exciting as the victim is a human being to tow up 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.940
 exhaustion 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.870
 Jules Dassin to bring to the screen the law 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.510
 with dialogues by franÃ§oise giroud 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.510
 and an exceptional distribution 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:19.520
 the origins 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.520
 the gesture of his son we did the game of the right 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.560
 That's what I like 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.380
 but the finish 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.080
 we do not play only for November 29 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.910
 it's for fun 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:35.930
 the employers because he has all the rights 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.930
 the law is played with so much passion and cruelty in taverns 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.600
 in life why in the meantime 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:50.900
 because women 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.900
 we see here but who makes the law m 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.120
 passion 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.380
 for love 

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:43.169
 they made a coffee tour at home 

00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:46.169
 look at the pictures I'm confident 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:50.709
