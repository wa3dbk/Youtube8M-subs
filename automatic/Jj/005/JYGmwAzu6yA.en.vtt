00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.330
 and well hello to all and is we 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.450
 find for a new tutorial then 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:20.720
 how to make fun spin on the iphone 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:22.849
 the ipad or ipod touch then normally 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.010
 it's dedicated only to the 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:26.390
 jailbreak but they made sure that 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.119
 it works under free and 7 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.590
 so what is one and spring then 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.800
 mind is to remove everything from the bug 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:36.770
 on your iphone ipad or ipod touch or 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.060
 lanterns so unfortunately it does not 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.970
 not work under I would say six I 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.600
 tried so it works for all 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.220
 icons 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.950
 I 'll take for example the 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.930
 settings you clicked twice on 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.820
 the home button 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:53.030
 here you are going to tip your 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:58.040
 window and at the same time click on 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:01:00.160
 the settings icon so tac and that's your 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.600
 iphone will restart automatically 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.829
 so he'll just do a reboot and 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:08.000
 not a relight ar ignition excuse me 

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:08.420
 so he will not ask you for your code 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.790
 pine 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:15.079
 he'll just ask you for your code of 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:20.539
 security if you chose him his target 

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:22.630
 had bet there and here is your iphone did 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:24.950
 more slow bugs and so on 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:29.380
 so I advise you to do it 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:32.780
 twice in a row for well removed 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:35.240
 the english bug i'm threshold is by 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.959
 example with the clock 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:42.350
 so there must not be any 

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:43.969
 things next so if I have things to 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.450
 side have to remove them otherwise it does not 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:50.929
 will not work that's timer then 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.590
 tac and here's your iphone reboots 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:53.779
 automatically 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:58.429
 I hope you liked this video
