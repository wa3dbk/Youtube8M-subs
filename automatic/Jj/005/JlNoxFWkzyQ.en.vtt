00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
tell them about the yeast if you add

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.690 
tell them about the yeast if you add
sugar<00:01:41.009> so<00:01:42.000> good<00:01:42.150> right<00:01:42.360> yes<00:01:42.659> sure<00:01:43.399> if<00:01:44.399> you<00:01:44.520> want

sugar so good right yes sure if you want
to<00:01:44.759> make<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.479> don't<00:01:45.630> have<00:01:45.720> time<00:01:45.930> right

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
to make it you don't have time right

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.630 
to make it you don't have time right
takes<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.530> lot<00:01:46.680> of<00:01:46.770> time<00:01:46.920> if<00:01:47.070> you<00:01:47.159> just<00:01:47.220> speed<00:01:47.579> it

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
takes a lot of time if you just speed it

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.830 
takes a lot of time if you just speed it
up<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:47.850> little<00:01:47.880> bit<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.149> little<00:01:48.210> bit<00:01:48.329> of<00:01:48.450> sugar<00:01:48.600> in

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
up a little bit a little bit of sugar in

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.670 
up a little bit a little bit of sugar in
the<00:01:48.899> dough<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.079> little<00:01:49.229> bit<00:01:49.409> of<00:01:49.500> honey

something like that here's a lot more
sugar<00:01:52.049> for<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.439> yeast<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.740> feed<00:01:53.070> off<00:01:53.280> so<00:01:53.490> it'll

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
sugar for the yeast to feed off so it'll

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.520 
sugar for the yeast to feed off so it'll
speed<00:01:53.880> up<00:01:54.000> your<00:01:54.149> bread<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:54.390> little<00:01:54.570> bit<00:01:54.899> sugar

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530

speed up your bread a little bit sugar
carbon<00:01:56.250> dioxide<00:01:56.909> right<00:01:57.509> that's<00:01:57.810> what<00:01:57.960> pushes

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
carbon dioxide right that's what pushes

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.490 
carbon dioxide right that's what pushes
it<00:01:58.409> up<00:01:58.500> look<00:01:58.710> at<00:01:58.770> this<00:01:59.180> look<00:02:00.180> at<00:02:00.270> this<00:02:00.390> how<00:02:01.320> much

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
air is in there it's from the yeast look

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.290 
air is in there it's from the yeast look
at<00:02:03.750> this<00:02:03.899> Oh
