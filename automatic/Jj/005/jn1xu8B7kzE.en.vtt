 I came between gaviria 

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:07.890
 you also talk about a rumor it would seem that the return of the mark 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.320
 65 for a sailor it's really for tomorrow when it's a fashion 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.470
 symbolic a fashion politika it's not a joke some men by the 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.909
 happened to involve the age that we always wear skirts men 

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:22.039
 we go back 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.239
 then you have% my friend year allawi who embodies Albanian they work 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:29.320
 all with us his models and who embodies a little bit in the fashion of the 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.940
 skirt 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.690
 when she started when she was stammering by marithé and françois 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:35.580
 girbaud so that's for sure it's not very controlled it looks like an archer a 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.000
 kind of robin of the woods 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.100
 cybernetic decline 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.520
 but the portrait well 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.250
 I wear a very nice little Belgian designer and fmi who we 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.280
 lend this model the animal would have after the debate 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.470
 sticky that I'm wearing seals and our friend are blooming over crates that carry 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:55.830
 karine hebert and carries the sbc collection's summer 2008 tell if markers 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.470
 a little democracy a tremendous asset more democratic urge than as soon as 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:00.620
 sewing hammers 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.730
 that's what awaits us so this currency is interesting 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.390
 because there he finally signs that the will of man to emancipate himself 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.120
 melody is running today is not enough to say here it does not prevent the 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.729

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.420
 it's to show you the diversity profile 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.110
 for those we men that our masculinity can embody you find 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.159
 that leads today we want to imitate them 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:26.909
 a desire to fight against the standardization of our wardrobe 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:27.850
 male 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.580
 we want to get out of these clichés yoke in which you lock us 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.430
 in short we are men of various fantastic men 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:34.350
 more in voice 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.060

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.340
 once the woman has appropriated a material where a color or 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.019

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:47.560
 largest increase in the cost of this reform 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.150
 the asus power but we can compare that with the wearing of pants for women 

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:56.819
 in the 1920s women of course claimed a university 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.119
 a tie 

00:02:58.119 --> 00:03:00.809
 with man and man on the same path 

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:05.089
 we can say that in fifty years we will have by this movement claim a 

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:07.079
 certain freedom to be 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:10.459
 that the man spoke only the Arab woman in fifty years may not be a 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:12.099
 enemy like pioneers 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:15.560

 exclusively masculine because it requires 

00:03:22.749 --> 00:03:25.189
 that's what I'm saying it's because the neighbors 

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:28.819
 in this case same step as do pantyhose understand 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:32.819
 fits perfectly in the shot 

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:34.819

 rome that will be long 

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:44.669
 paradoxically more than men

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:24.879

 the truth we receive it we do not wear well 

00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:30.400
 not to put off all often in the same way 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.770
 the hunting difference 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.569

 a great brand of settlers created his rings at three months is the sign 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:04:59.390
 that we men visited us ladies 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:02.490
 a little bit more as we said in the magneto as in the 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.700
 20s where you women you have been limited men with them the 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.070
 boy studies testify his allies it's not taking your 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.620
 codes 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:11.750
 clothing 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.450

 it was he who had started the manhasset gauthier negotiate he had nothing 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.440
 invented and emmanuel reach fairly constant games in the foreground are 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.380

 pants is doing the economy talk a herd her daughter is a little hole 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.990
 Maybe what we fear nobody will see a little hole 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:51.180
 it shows that a small flock is good at last, you have to show them 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:54.430
 teeth and the restauroute and if it's a small hole ten seconds of silence
