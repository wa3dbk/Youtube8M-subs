 ah 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.020
 ah 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.100

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.160
 hello youtube friends are welcome 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.470
 to a new tutorial and this time 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.540
 I've been bringing you how to increase the 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.550
 defaults of hearing aids 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.740
 that is, increase the volume of 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.930
 hearing aids and also the speakers in 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:05.270
 our android terminal this tutorial 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.950
 is dedicated to the alcatel is because 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.260
 I 've only seen this code that works 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.480
 in terminals alcatel one touch no 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.970
 it matters which one I have the alcatel 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.170
 oneto 40 30 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.030
 and the code is as follows 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.710
 we need no program or a 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.320
 application we are simply going to enter 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.440
 this code in the phone application 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:29.810
 or speed dialing let's enter 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:35.930
 asterisk cat asterisk cat 3 6 4 6 6 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:39.920
 3 3 asterisk sorry a cat this disc 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:42.580
 cat this disk and automatically not 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.080
 we need to put the call icon 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.850
 because this small menu moves us 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.830
 where we will be able to modify several 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.899
 things of our android system but in 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.570
 what we are going to focus on is to modify 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:55.990
 the audio 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:58.170
 the terminal audio we give the hardware 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.550
 testing that we will obtain 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.200
 hardware moving twice like this 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.090
 testing and then we go to the box 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.670
 audio after 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.250
 hansen mod and default will come 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.010
 at number 108 they're going to have to 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:15.040
 put you in 160 and down also in 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.110
 160 since if they put it in a value 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.510
 too high can they be thrown out 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.060
 lose the horn or you no longer hear the 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:25.810
 hearing aids after that they will give you 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:28.239
 be like that and as you see the audio has been 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:31.709
 modified lean in set and the audio has been 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:36.340
 modified then they have to return 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:38.020
 return return again return and 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.480
 what they have to do is restart 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:44.150
 cell so restart 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:47.480
 and then the garments can try 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.370
 any music with your headphones and 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.680
 that the truth increases too much in the 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.520
 hearing aids I recommend that please do not 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.460
 you try 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.590
 to the degree of putting a very high number 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:02.130
 because you can leave the hearing aids 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.840
 inactive so 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.210
 this has been all I hope there is 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.040
 liked comment subscribe from like and 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:10.500
 before I say goodbye I give you this advice 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.540
 that if you let it stop 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.300
 listen to hearing aids I recommend that 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.260
 refocus on the code that you 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.830
 you can download in the link of the 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:22.830
 description and put it back to 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:24.930
 focus on hardware testing then audio and 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.540
 you are going to put 108 in both as it came 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.730
 to determine on your android phone and 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:34.700
 if it does not work you have to format 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.700
 cellular and this has been all goodbye 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.280
 i 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.940
