00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
think I got them in different areas

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.170 
think I got them in different areas
immensely<00:01:40.799> so<00:01:41.070> with<00:01:41.369> numbers<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:41.820> stuff<00:01:42.030> like

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
immensely so with numbers and stuff like

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.660 
immensely so with numbers and stuff like
that<00:01:42.240> they<00:01:42.600> I<00:01:42.630> got<00:01:42.960> him<00:01:43.079> but<00:01:43.380> when<00:01:44.189> it<00:01:44.310> comes<00:01:44.520> to

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
that they I got him but when it comes to

that they I got him but when it comes to
just<00:01:44.880> different<00:01:45.299> aspects<00:01:45.720> he's<00:01:45.990> probably

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
just different aspects he's probably

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.200
