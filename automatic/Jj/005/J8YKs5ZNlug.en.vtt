00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.420 

so<00:00:00.240> I<00:00:00.920> really<00:00:01.920> hope<00:00:01.949> this<00:00:03.680> camera<00:00:04.680> is<00:00:04.710> angled

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
so I really hope this camera is angled

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.600 
so I really hope this camera is angled
correctly<00:00:05.640> because<00:00:06.299> I<00:00:06.870> don't<00:00:07.140> have<00:00:07.200> a<00:00:07.610> camera

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
correctly because I don't have a camera

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.490 
correctly because I don't have a camera
that<00:00:08.760> flips<00:00:09.179> out<00:00:09.360> it's<00:00:09.630> just<00:00:09.719> like<00:00:09.960> a<00:00:10.050> basic

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
that flips out it's just like a basic

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.039 
that flips out it's just like a basic
canon<00:00:11.070> powershot<00:00:11.210> so<00:00:12.210> I<00:00:12.240> really<00:00:12.570> don't<00:00:12.780> know

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
products that I use and everything I've

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.180 
products that I use and everything I've
just<00:00:50.940> been<00:00:51.180> using<00:00:51.420> like<00:00:51.780> when<00:00:52.649> I<00:00:52.680> feel<00:00:52.949> like<00:00:52.980> it

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
just been using like when I feel like it

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.260 
and I think it's a little better if I
set<00:00:54.989> something<00:00:55.230> up<00:00:55.500> if<00:00:55.980> I<00:00:56.340> do<00:00:56.399> set<00:00:56.879> something

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
set something up if I do set something

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.970 
set something up if I do set something
up<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.570> if<00:00:57.690> I<00:00:57.780> feel<00:00:57.989> like<00:00:58.140> make<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.530> skin<00:00:58.770> care
