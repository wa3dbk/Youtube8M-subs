00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
had the impact that it did and will

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.100 
had the impact that it did and will
explain<00:02:22.430> that<00:02:22.580> in<00:02:22.849> a<00:02:23.060> minute<00:02:23.209> but<00:02:23.420> i<00:02:23.660> can<00:02:23.900> tell

you that that one of the clues to the

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.259 
you that that one of the clues to the
significance<00:02:27.319> of<00:02:27.500> this<00:02:27.650> message<00:02:28.220> has<00:02:28.910> to<00:02:28.940> do

with<00:02:29.450> this<00:02:29.630> massive<00:02:30.019> ledge<00:02:30.890> of<00:02:31.130> rock<00:02:31.459> that<00:02:32.200> we

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
with this massive ledge of rock that we

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.610 
with this massive ledge of rock that we

see before us and the fact that the
water<00:02:37.209> bubbles<00:02:38.209> out<00:02:38.450> from<00:02:38.840> under<00:02:39.170> it<00:02:39.200> it<00:02:39.980> just

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
water bubbles out from under it it just

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.180 
water bubbles out from under it it just
comes<00:02:40.489> right<00:02:40.640> up<00:02:40.880> out<00:02:41.660> of<00:02:41.720> the<00:02:41.989> ground<00:02:42.290> you

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
comes right up out of the ground you

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.490 
comes right up out of the ground you
can't<00:02:43.430> really<00:02:43.610> tell<00:02:43.940> where<00:02:44.180> it<00:02:44.299> comes<00:02:44.540> from<00:02:44.690> it

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
can't really tell where it comes from it

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
you can even see it you can see it you

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.199 
you can even see it you can see it you
can<00:02:50.690> walk<00:02:51.380> up<00:02:51.410> to<00:02:51.830> it<00:02:51.860> and<00:02:52.220> see<00:02:52.819> the<00:02:52.850> water

coming<00:02:53.569> out<00:02:53.989> of<00:02:54.049> the<00:02:54.260> ground<00:02:54.430> where<00:02:55.430> this<00:02:55.640> rock

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
coming out of the ground where this rock

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.710 
coming out of the ground where this rock
cliff<00:02:56.810> meets<00:02:57.650> the<00:02:57.920> ground<00:02:58.269> the<00:02:59.269> other<00:02:59.420> thing

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
cliff meets the ground the other thing

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.420 
cliff meets the ground the other thing
that's<00:02:59.750> important<00:03:00.440> though<00:03:00.620> is<00:03:00.650> that<00:03:01.160> there

Israel<00:04:05.450> their<00:04:06.079> significance<00:04:06.709> to<00:04:06.920> that<00:04:06.950> too

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
Israel their significance to that too

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.420 
Israel their significance to that too
there<00:04:08.090> is<00:04:08.239> as<00:04:08.450> much<00:04:08.480> significance<00:04:09.410> to<00:04:09.620> that<00:04:09.650> as

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
there is as much significance to that as

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.879 
there is as much significance to that as
there<00:04:10.760> is<00:04:11.000> to<00:04:11.269> this<00:04:11.510> so<00:04:12.139> now<00:04:12.260> we<00:04:12.319> have<00:04:12.470> four

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:12.889
