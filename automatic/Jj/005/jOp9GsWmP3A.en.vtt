00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.410
 testing testing after a long time 

00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:07.299
 of existence I have discovered that it is 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:08.950
 better not to put music to this video 

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:10.960
 because that way I will not be confused with the 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:14.730
 music and I'm going to have to repeat the 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.800
 video over and over and over again 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.840
 I hope this video I hope to do it 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.400
 short because the only thing he wants to teach 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.439
 is how they downloaded the emulator from the 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.610
 play doh and emulate the blah blah blah 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.180
 blah 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:28.500
 it is very simple this emulator so no 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.390
 I recommend it for people who 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.750
 have a windows xp like I have if 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.350
 you have a 7 a windows view another type 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.539
 from windows or computer 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.850
 I recommend that you shake me 

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:43.969
 because this as is Windows XP 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.219
 a few years ago, it is very 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:48.510
 basic and there are better emulators 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:52.079
 configured with better 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.210
 of everything better than this computer yes 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.239
 I heard some skinny skinny I do not know what 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.829
 it will be some interference but every time 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.629
 that I try to start a video lounge and 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.140
 conference I do not know if it will be by mobile or 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.010
 for something that I will have here lit 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.010
 let's start 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.540
 to see if copy this is the first link 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.200
 this video is not mine and the truth is that 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:24.150
 thank you very much to the owner of the video and 78 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.230
 sports amd the link 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:30.270
 in this video is that I prefer a certain 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:34.380
 full screen well is that I prefer 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.720
 do not put teaches the fifth head of fine 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.040
 to the mix 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.870
 and it gives you a link to the emulator 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.550
 I recommend you how to get into this video 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.650
 See you write 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.090
 I wear this I like added favorite 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:49.810
 I wrote 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:53.270
 and I told him here over here he will download 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.909
 cool with what do you expect a little 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.829
 and they appear in the windows live tab 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.890
 here start and session or I do not know if it does 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:04.179
 lack of students and download them 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.179
 Jce around here is very simple 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.700
 once downloaded it is extracted any 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.140
 folder for example I downloaded it 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:15.650
 in one I do not know if you can see 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:18.870
 surely not what is called pc is sx 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.750
 20.9 point 9 which is the latest version of 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.600
 this emulator 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.290
 this is the program to execute it and it is 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.370
 very easy you just give it two clicks 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:32.750
 this already comes all perfectly 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:34.430
 configured the settings and all this me 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.310
 I recommend that you configure the 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:40.690
 control me for example the command I have a 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.580
 wireless control like those of the play 3 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.110
 and I have configured it so that it comes out 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.100
 right now I do not have with this command 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.100
 connect it 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:55.830
 and all this is set and so is very 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.650
 easy to play with the game that better 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.720
 than using the keyboard 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.640
 If you want to emulate any game as 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.549
 you have to have marked the image button 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.220
 iso and the iso selector look for the 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:09.349
 game that you want to emulate for example 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:12.409
 this is the fifth gea remix ching of 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:14.299
 memories that is in Spanish I 've already 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:17.209
 patched has cost me a lot of time 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:19.220
 patch it not download it not deserve 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.660
 find it because I already hold on to a 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.330
 I can not do anything 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:29.930
 Well then what do I know what you want system 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.930
 you start cd &amp; v fast if it is to maximize 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:36.400
 and the game simulates if the oil this is for 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:38.170
 blame for the recording that this is a 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.830
 recording that you sing to me already studied and that 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:45.540
 clear that delays the shape of the flaps 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:47.489
 good frasn fractions per second 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.680
 what happens is that now I can not use 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:52.920
 the command because like the ignition 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.019
 After the emulator, I'm left 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.210
 as stuck but of equal is that text 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:58.490
 all right 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:02.030
 now I will teach how to download the 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:04.069
 that and do not be milk memorizes in Spanish 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.690
 for this we will go to the extraction of 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:09.950
 link that is this 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.950
 go Go 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:19.669
 and it takes you to a torrent of a link 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:23.960
 where you can download every two times 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:25.730
 and it's a little stupid good 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.560
 unzip if we had an iso 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:30.410
 like this do not worry about those three 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.600
 files now I'll explain it to you as a 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:35.630
 Once you have this iso we can do 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.190
 perfectly game the only thing that happens is 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.870
 if you already want to play it in Spanish and 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.820
 is not playing in English or in Japanese 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:44.580
 in this case is the American version 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:47.310
 then you need to go to the last 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:50.129
 link art series other link that would be 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:54.150
 we copy it 

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:58.290
 we do here we paste it and we access it 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:59.430
 It always takes you to carry a link that 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:02.150
 says there is an expiration problem 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.150
 what seconds 

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:08.919
 and we give you downloads from here 

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:08.919
 6 

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:14.819
 I already downloaded and we would be 

00:05:13.019 --> 00:05:19.819
 these three files above the pp effe 

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:19.819
 Felix and the king of kings of memory 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.469
 all you have to do is give it 

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:24.469
 two clicks to this 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.840
 it has let me be of good sound and 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:36.419
 also that we perceive 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.400
 we select the son whose almost now 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:40.320
 I have patched but good if we 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:44.010
 we have it in English is not worth the Japanese 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:46.600
 you give him to see and accept pressure 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:49.570
 to a music 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:53.020
 Then if they catch you a pf and all that 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:56.400
 is here so calm that there's no 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:59.050
 loss and once done you will be left 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:03.360
 patched in Spanish 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:03.360
 And the only thing that remains is to prove it 

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:12.160
 If you have any problems, confirm it 

00:06:09.779 --> 00:06:15.630
 the system 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.630
 better tell him to open it again 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.980
 and now supposedly has to 

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:22.980
 work friendly 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:29.630
 and the truth as in expired just where 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.630
 is 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.470
 huecco 3 here 

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:42.680
 I was training in a room 

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:42.680
 called darkness without background 

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:48.409
 in which there are no hearts 

00:06:45.229 --> 00:06:49.940
 full shade and that helps a lot 

00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:53.270
 understand 

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:55.169
 and for existed to premiere get 

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:57.840
 best letters 

00:06:55.169 --> 00:06:59.940
 and make the liver easier 

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:02.370
 right now I am level 2 and only 

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:05.540
 I could level up f9 

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:05.540
 [Music] 

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:16.040
 the bad thing about this is that you can not see where 

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:16.040
 It is normal but 

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.959
 [Music] 

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:29.099
 well, this has been all 

00:07:26.139 --> 00:07:29.099
 who has sex
