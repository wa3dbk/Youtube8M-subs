arrange your own video I'm Hannah and
today<00:00:20.340> we're<00:00:20.550> gonna<00:00:20.640> make<00:00:20.910> two<00:00:21.359> nice<00:00:21.689> lush

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
today we're gonna make two nice lush

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.700 
today we're gonna make two nice lush
pieces<00:00:22.830> to<00:00:23.430> go<00:00:23.580> around<00:00:23.850> your<00:00:23.970> homes<00:00:24.439> so<00:00:25.439> I've

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
pieces to go around your homes so I've

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.009 
pieces to go around your homes so I've
chosen<00:00:26.039> two<00:00:26.820> bases<00:00:27.269> that<00:00:27.449> are<00:00:27.510> differing

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
chosen two bases that are differing

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.950 
chosen two bases that are differing
Heights<00:00:28.050> but<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:29.010> same<00:00:29.250> width<00:00:29.550> around<00:00:29.960> this

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
Heights but the same width around this

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.049 
Heights but the same width around this
is<00:00:31.380> going<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.920> create<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.369> cohesion<00:00:32.969> between

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
is going to create a cohesion between

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.900 
is going to create a cohesion between
two<00:00:33.540> spaces<00:00:34.079> so<00:00:34.530> let's<00:00:34.770> say<00:00:34.950> you<00:00:35.010> place<00:00:35.399> this

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
two spaces so let's say you place this

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.180 
two spaces so let's say you place this
one<00:00:36.149> in<00:00:36.239> your<00:00:36.360> kitchen<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:36.989> this<00:00:37.739> one<00:00:37.950> in<00:00:38.070> your

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
one in your kitchen and this one in your

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.580 
one in your kitchen and this one in your
living<00:00:38.489> room<00:00:38.700> as<00:00:38.879> you<00:00:39.210> walk<00:00:39.390> through<00:00:39.809> your

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
living room as you walk through your

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.680 
living room as you walk through your
home<00:00:40.890> you'll<00:00:41.160> have<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.430> nice<00:00:41.790> cohesion<00:00:42.600> between

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
home you'll have a nice cohesion between

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.799 
home you'll have a nice cohesion between
all<00:00:43.079> of<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:43.550> so<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.670> flowers<00:00:45.090> we<00:00:45.270> have<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.629> work

and a spit easterly's now first I'm

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.719 
and a spit easterly's now first I'm
going<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.729> take<00:01:17.939> these<00:01:18.119> leaves<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:19.170> just<00:01:19.729> cut

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
going to take these leaves and just cut

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.800 
going to take these leaves and just cut
off<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:20.880> base

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.870 

and<00:01:26.130> fold<00:01:27.130> it<00:01:27.280> right<00:01:27.460> inside<00:01:27.880> my<00:01:28.090> face<00:01:29.880> we're

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
and fold it right inside my face we're

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.929 
and fold it right inside my face we're
going<00:01:30.909> to<00:01:31.060> do<00:01:31.180> this<00:01:31.299> with<00:01:31.540> both<00:01:31.689> of<00:01:31.930> these<00:01:32.939> the

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:33.939 
going to do this with both of these the

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:35.399 
going to do this with both of these the
two<00:01:34.180> bases<00:01:34.600> are<00:01:34.720> really<00:01:35.020> going<00:01:35.140> to<00:01:35.200> have<00:01:35.380> a

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
two bases are really going to have a

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:40.620 
two bases are really going to have a
similar<00:01:36.369> look<00:01:36.579> to<00:01:36.789> them<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.909> only<00:01:40.240> difference

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
similar look to them the only difference

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.669 
similar look to them the only difference
is<00:01:40.840> the<00:01:41.020> height<00:01:42.090> so<00:01:43.090> to<00:01:43.149> start<00:01:43.450> with<00:01:43.679> this

00:01:44.669 --> 00:01:44.679 
is the height so to start with this

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:48.569 
is the height so to start with this
dianthus<00:01:45.640> creates<00:01:46.450> a<00:01:46.570> really<00:01:46.929> nice<00:01:47.080> shape<00:01:47.579> so

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:48.579 
dianthus creates a really nice shape so

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:49.919 
dianthus creates a really nice shape so
we're<00:01:48.759> just<00:01:48.789> going<00:01:49.149> to<00:01:49.179> take<00:01:49.570> these<00:01:49.869> and

00:01:49.919 --> 00:01:49.929 
we're just going to take these and

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:52.410 
we're just going to take these and
remove<00:01:50.679> any<00:01:50.950> stems<00:01:51.369> that<00:01:51.820> might<00:01:51.970> fall<00:01:52.240> below

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
remove any stems that might fall below

00:01:52.420 --> 00:02:00.419 
remove any stems that might fall below
the<00:01:52.689> waterline<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:56.159> in<00:01:57.159> either<00:01:57.610> vase<00:01:59.429> start

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:00.429 
the waterline and in either vase start

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:03.120 
the waterline and in either vase start
placing<00:02:01.000> the<00:02:01.569> stones<00:02:01.840> so<00:02:02.319> that<00:02:02.470> they<00:02:02.590> go<00:02:02.799> in

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
placing the stones so that they go in

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.149 
placing the stones so that they go in
kind<00:02:03.310> of<00:02:03.459> a<00:02:03.549> circular<00:02:04.060> direction<00:02:04.860> so<00:02:05.860> you<00:02:05.979> get

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
kind of a circular direction so you get

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:12.330 
kind of a circular direction so you get
a<00:02:06.189> nice<00:02:06.459> full<00:02:06.819> shape<00:02:08.789> in<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:11.530> taller<00:02:11.799> base<00:02:12.069> I'm

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
a nice full shape in the taller base I'm

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.710 
a nice full shape in the taller base I'm
going<00:02:12.459> to<00:02:12.519> use<00:02:12.610> a<00:02:12.640> little<00:02:12.910> bit<00:02:13.000> more<00:02:13.060> of<00:02:13.390> course

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.190 

so<00:02:16.720> we'll<00:02:16.930> use<00:02:17.110> three<00:02:17.470> stems<00:02:17.769> and<00:02:18.010> the<00:02:18.099> tall

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
so we'll use three stems and the tall

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.070 
so we'll use three stems and the tall
and<00:02:20.200> just<00:02:20.280> one<00:02:21.280> on<00:02:21.700> each<00:02:22.180> side<00:02:22.480> kind<00:02:22.510> of<00:02:22.930> like<00:02:23.049> a

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
and just one on each side kind of like a

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.720 
and just one on each side kind of like a
triangle

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.759 

and<00:02:28.819> it'll<00:02:29.420> make<00:02:29.660> a<00:02:29.720> nice<00:02:29.989> circular<00:02:30.800> shape

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
and it'll make a nice circular shape

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:35.830 
and it'll make a nice circular shape
next<00:02:33.769> we'll<00:02:33.950> do<00:02:34.099> the<00:02:34.160> same<00:02:34.459> thing<00:02:34.819> to<00:02:35.780> our

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
next we'll do the same thing to our

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.520 
next we'll do the same thing to our
smaller<00:02:36.140> base

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.980 

and<00:02:42.040> place<00:02:42.370> both<00:02:42.580> stems<00:02:43.030> right<00:02:43.630> inside

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.260 

in<00:02:47.050> the<00:02:47.650> flower<00:02:47.890> industry<00:02:48.130> doing<00:02:48.850> two

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
in the flower industry doing two

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.570 
in the flower industry doing two
arrangements<00:02:49.840> at<00:02:49.900> the<00:02:49.960> same<00:02:50.200> time<00:02:50.500> creates<00:02:51.310> a

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
arrangements at the same time creates a

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.500 
arrangements at the same time creates a
really<00:02:52.300> a<00:02:52.690> lot<00:02:52.780> more<00:02:53.080> fast-paced<00:02:53.710> environment

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
really a lot more fast-paced environment

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.970 
really a lot more fast-paced environment
so<00:02:55.510> it<00:02:55.660> actually<00:02:56.050> saves<00:02:56.350> you<00:02:56.470> time<00:02:56.650> if<00:02:56.860> you

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
so it actually saves you time if you

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.740 
so it actually saves you time if you
make<00:02:57.010> them<00:02:57.310> both<00:02:57.490> the<00:02:57.670> same<00:02:57.700> way<00:02:57.940> that's<00:02:58.570> why<00:02:58.720> I

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
make them both the same way that's why I

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.690 
make them both the same way that's why I
like<00:02:59.020> to<00:02:59.140> do<00:02:59.260> both<00:02:59.920> at<00:03:00.040> the<00:03:00.160> same<00:03:00.370> time<00:03:01.080> next

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
like to do both at the same time next

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.970 
like to do both at the same time next
we're<00:03:03.700> gonna<00:03:03.760> take<00:03:04.060> the<00:03:04.240> kale<00:03:04.480> stone<00:03:04.840> and<00:03:05.290> I

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
we're gonna take the kale stone and I

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.010 
we're gonna take the kale stone and I
like<00:03:06.190> to<00:03:06.400> remove<00:03:06.760> these<00:03:07.240> bottom<00:03:07.750> leaves

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
like to remove these bottom leaves

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.600 
like to remove these bottom leaves
because<00:03:08.440> they<00:03:08.560> start<00:03:08.830> to<00:03:08.860> turn<00:03:09.100> a<00:03:09.160> little<00:03:09.370> bit

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
because they start to turn a little bit

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.920 
because they start to turn a little bit
yellow<00:03:09.790> after<00:03:10.270> a<00:03:10.300> while<00:03:10.540> and<00:03:11.220> then<00:03:12.220> it<00:03:13.180> pop<00:03:13.660> out

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
yellow after a while and then it pop out

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.440 
yellow after a while and then it pop out
the<00:03:14.230> little<00:03:14.260> petals<00:03:14.800> just<00:03:15.270> to<00:03:16.270> make

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
the little petals just to make

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.170 
the little petals just to make
everything<00:03:16.810> more<00:03:17.380> showy<00:03:17.710> I<00:03:18.130> guess<00:03:19.030> they're

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
everything more showy I guess they're

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.000 
everything more showy I guess they're
not<00:03:19.210> petals<00:03:19.600> they're<00:03:19.780> leaves<00:03:19.990> but<00:03:20.380> close

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
not petals they're leaves but close

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.060 
not petals they're leaves but close
enough<00:03:21.250> and<00:03:21.780> then<00:03:22.780> another<00:03:23.200> way<00:03:23.470> to<00:03:23.530> open<00:03:23.860> this

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
enough and then another way to open this

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.740 
enough and then another way to open this
is<00:03:24.310> just<00:03:24.610> roll<00:03:24.850> it<00:03:25.030> between<00:03:25.150> two<00:03:25.980> hands<00:03:27.570> and<00:03:28.570> it

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
is just roll it between two hands and it

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.020 
is just roll it between two hands and it
opens<00:03:29.050> everything<00:03:29.410> up<00:03:29.710> a<00:03:30.040> little<00:03:30.910> bit<00:03:31.120> more

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
opens everything up a little bit more

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.880 
opens everything up a little bit more
and<00:03:34.030> we're<00:03:34.270> just<00:03:34.450> going<00:03:34.570> to<00:03:34.660> cut<00:03:34.810> this<00:03:35.050> down

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.720 

which<00:03:38.340> simply<00:03:38.730> the<00:03:38.880> name

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:47.559 
now I'm going to place this in a taller
arrangement<00:03:46.700> because<00:03:46.819> it's<00:03:47.060> obviously<00:03:47.480> a

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:47.569 
arrangement because it's obviously a

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:54.460 
arrangement because it's obviously a
little<00:03:47.780> bit<00:03:47.930> larger<00:03:52.450> it's<00:03:53.450> a<00:03:53.540> nice<00:03:53.690> soft<00:03:54.019> spot

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
little bit larger it's a nice soft spot
