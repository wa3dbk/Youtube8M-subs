00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 hello tomorrow you spend the oral of a 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.760
 business school 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.500
 this is an essential moment why because 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.420
 than oral and often have a very 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.790
 high coefficient 5 or 6 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.010
 in other words the oral is what 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.199
 can you save or stoop 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.699
 this video i will reveal to you 10 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.670
 pitfalls to avoid 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.380
 when we pass the oral of a contest for 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.320
 enter a business school 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.390
 first mistake having a presentation 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.090
 to boats 1 it is the candidate who 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.550
 start his thing so that's bolduc 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.700
 I'm 23 years old I have a scientific bac 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.800
 I had to chew and then I 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.890
 do two years of college and blah blah blah 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.020
 blah blah blah and total of game entry the 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.059
 jury says good still someone who is going 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.770
 tell us his life is someone who 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.230
 did not make the effort to put some 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.270
 something original so an error 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.879
 frequent it's an introduction a 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:00.329
 way of presenting oneself very boat that 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.980
 the jury remains asleep and who 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.110
 causes the candidate to remain drowned in 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.729
 the mass of competitors to enter 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.479
 in this school second mistake 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.760
 classical 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.220
 it's a very vague motivation when we 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.380
 tell the candidates why this school 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.200
 ah bah I do not know too much 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.659
 see the candidate does not know where he wants 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.850
 go his motivation is blurry he did 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.470
 very little research work and 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.520
 finally he does not know if you are we have a 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.500
 little bit the pressure that there in 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.110
 tourists so second trap 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.159
 Fuzzy motivations 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.570
 third classic mistake during 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.460
 interviews with a jury 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.040
 it's the lack of example 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.970
 illustration the candidate employs 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.820
 very general terms 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.570
 I have a good relationship I have the sense of 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.909
 contact 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.740
 I am passionate about selling or any 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.780
 these are the words the question to be 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.939
 ask what is the example I can give 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.710
 so obviously when you are a beginner 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.390
 and when we did not say professional we 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.780
 do not necessarily have tons of things to 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.700
 tell 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.920
 but we can type speaking in his life 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.930
 associative have personal projects 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.509
 for really given the examples of 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.250
 illustrations in the end beyond the 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.270
 general speech these are these examples 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.439
 who will stand out from the others 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.079
 candidates 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.210
 fourth mistake the lack of structures 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.340
 in the answers ie 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.260
 we ask a candidate question he answers 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.730
 but we have the impression of a 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.490
 speech that is very improvised is 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.350
 the candidate does not know how to put 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:22.180
 before the important elements it's too much 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:24.320
 long it does not catch its mark not a 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.380
 fifth mistake these are the candidates 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.150
 who plays a character we feel they 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.490
 have learned their text that they repeated 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.320
 and who are building an image that 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.800
 finally to little to do with the 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.350
 reality 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.750
 and finally it gives profiles that 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.250
 sounds hollow and the jury feels that 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.610
 behind these beautiful speeches it's 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.400
 empty 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:46.400
 so attention did not show any picture 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.350
 ideal the jury is not fooled 6th error 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.750
 so often in business school 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.790
 at one point the jury will test you 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.460
 I will go over you are bad anymore 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.960
 candidate is bad the more it annoys the 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.460
 jury plus the jury wants to shake 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.500
 a little coconut tree to see what is there 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.690
 behind this image it so tests 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.760
 very simple sold me this pen 1 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.990
 and here an error is the lack of 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.630
 respondent ie the candidate 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.350
 and blah blah blah blah blah blah he knows 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.720
 not really what to say 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:14.420
 so actually it is important 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.860
 to have some spread is not about 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.370
 to play at the finest but it takes 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.380
 concatenate 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.910
 at one point you are not judged on this 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.680
 that you're going to say but on the fact that 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.910
 good you're going to fight you're going 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.110
 trying to do something is a 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.060
 little like someone who is not terrible 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.800
 in English if you ask him a question 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.170
 in English he begins to say ah well I 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.180
 do not know how good he loses all credibility 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.620
 on the other hand if something comes out even if 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.710
 it's not Shakespearean English 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.150
 classic we see he wants to fight 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.560
 7th mistake is the lack of 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.190
 knowledge about the school and its 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.500
 outlets 1 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.030
 we have the impression that the 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.650
 candidate will go around 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.200
 different schools and then try to 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.210
 do not go too far from home where there 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.190
 there is some interesting leisure skiing style 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:53.900
 or the beach nearby and that 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.000
 finally he was not interested in 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.170
 school so that's important does a 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.780
 research work what are the 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.190
 sectors what are the outlets towards 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.480
 what can this school lead you into 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.640
 particular what are the highlights 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.630
 of this school there will always be one or 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.860
 two questions of this kind there for 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.830
 actually if the candidate is 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:12.080
 documented 8th mistake is the lack of 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.240
 general culture to say that when we 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.490
 pose 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.500
 candidate a question of the style that was 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:20.110
 Baron Haussmann 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:22.600
 there we do not know anything so it is 

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:24.490
 important to have general knowledge 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.960
 we can not know everything but there is 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.250
 general sewing manuals for 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.290
 to potash a little bit school 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.760
 what we can recommend is also 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.010
 read some books biographies 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.840
 of famous men churchill still said 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.340
 and to have pulled a small panoply 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.410
 anecdotes that will only be at a moment 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.760
 ask you a question about what is 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.500
 leadership or see what kind of 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.660
 things boom you have an anecdote to 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.500
 tell one who will show the jury that 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.600
 you are someone who has a good 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.530
 curiosity of mind 9th mistake then there 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.020
 you have candidates who have a 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:52.210
 speech lurking that is prepared but 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:55.330
 who in conversation is fluffed by 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.310
 stress so it's hands that 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.720
 shake lot red blush it's 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:00.460
 also a candidate who will watch 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.520
 elsewhere and who dares not set too much the 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:05.530
 jury attention one can have on the bottom 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.630
 a speech that stands now if 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.650
 on the form we are hesitant to miss 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:11.320
 self-confidence 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.700
 the jury the sense so the tone is 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.280
 important the way of saying things 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.600
 there is a question of dosage sometimes the 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.910
 juries complain about having candidates 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.340
 a little arrogant game that's all and 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:23.700
 then there the error reverses the candidate who 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.540
 is there excuse me to be in front of you has 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:28.630
 so the idea is to find the tone 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.260
 just spoken with firm conviction without 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.970
 to do too much 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:33.160
 the tone is an essential element for 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:35.860
 give confidence to the people in front 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.480
 of you 10th mistake in front of a jury is 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:40.180
 a way of speaking a very voice 

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:41.950
 monotone so the candidate he tells 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:44.440
 his thing yes so that's it so I did 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:46.530
 this I did that and so following that 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.449
 I did an internship in a company that 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:51.940
 manufactured 

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:55.780
 documents printing styles etc 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:58.210
 and so blablabla very linear style there 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:00.419
 is important to play on track 1 of 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:03.250
 modulate his path to create interest 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:04.900
 you know there are actors you them 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:05.979
 give a text even if the text is not 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.810
 not terrible they will do something 

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:11.110
 beautiful thing because there are 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:12.850
 modulations a rite therefore sets the tone 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:13.510
 voice is important to 

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:16.720
 differentiate 

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:19.600
 in an interview with a jury I am
