00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:17.650
 Thank you very much for taking a look 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:24.689
 This year 2014 this time 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:24.689
 We will introduce the Lexus nx 300 hf sports 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.169
 At first 5 minutes 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:40.270
 This is nx but Lexus 's first compact crossover suv 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.730
 I am 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:48.590
 Because this grade is Eg sports 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:51.700
 A sporty version equipped with performance dampers etc. and inheriting the sport 's running 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.700
 It has become 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:01.050
 The aluminum wheel is also equipped with an adhesive late 18-inch aluminum wheel 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:13.409
 But after all, nx is the power of this large spindle grille 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:18.149
 The impact is great 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:22.549
 In the sense of personality and presence that can be said to be the weak point of Japanese cars 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:22.549
 I think nx is attractive by itself 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:31.780
 This nx is a manufacturer option 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.780
 Equipped with 3 gun full LED headlamps 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.369
 The manufacturer's optional power back door is also equipped 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.580
 Then I would like to receive the engine 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:36.069
 After all it's a hybrid so it's quite quiet and I'll try a little on it 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:41.549
 yeah 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:41.549
 The parking brake is also released automatically. 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:54.230
 I'm stepping on the accelerator just by not coming to the meter, but I enjoy the smooth acceleration surprisingly 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.230
 I will 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:06.290
 I think that it is not visible to everyone like you are viewing 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:10.989
 Lane indication and speedometer are displayed on the windshield of the driver's seat here 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.989
 It is quite convenient that the display is displayed 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:23.860
 It was said that a dedicated performance damper was included 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.860
 The ride is not so hard and I feel pretty good 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:29.190
 I want to step into the accelerator to a little power 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:42.330
 It is quite good family to react soon 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:42.330
 The lanekeeping assist is activated when the speed is over 50 km . 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.860
 Look now at Eiler Cruise Control 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:53.900
 I have set 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:59.920
 This car than we have with all speed tracking function 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.920
 Us before the car to go to the stop to meet together to stop 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.390
 I am not doing anything now 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:16.050
 I will take you to the stop like this 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:24.860
 And stop once 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:31.210
 As a leader sends a signal, it will signal 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:31.210
 If you press the accelerator lightly , it will go up to the original setting speed . 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:38.080
 With one button in this nx 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:44.260
 eco mode Rome Ru mode 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:48.280
 Sports s mode Sports s Plus mode can be selected 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:51.750
 The meter is also changing accordingly 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.750
 It is eco mode now 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:58.129
 This is normal mode 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:02.240
 This is sports s mode 

00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:07.729
 We further here becomes the sport s plus mode 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:11.300
 If you are in sport s and sport s + mode, the meter on the left is 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:14.229
 End change to tachometer 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.229
 How is this 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:21.780
 Room lights and map lamps can be turned on with touch sensors 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.710
 About 10 minutes 2 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.710
 Beneath the 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.180
 Carry 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.180
 ride on 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.689
 Huh was considerable 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:40.189
 Also 

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:40.189
 While being a compact car plus 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:47.550
 I felt like I was there 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:51.680
 Because there is still equipment that are not able to introduce in this video 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:55.180
 Please try to actually see and everyone visit us 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.180
