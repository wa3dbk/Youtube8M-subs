00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.150 
now I actually don't really enjoy
playing<00:00:24.720> this<00:00:25.140> champion<00:00:25.590> because<00:00:25.740> I<00:00:25.949> think

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
playing this champion because I think

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.830 
playing this champion because I think
it's<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.369> little<00:00:26.640> bit<00:00:26.849> cheap<00:00:27.330> that<00:00:27.570> you<00:00:27.660> can

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
it's a little bit cheap that you can

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.060 
it's a little bit cheap that you can
build<00:00:27.990> them<00:00:28.109> tanky<00:00:28.380> and<00:00:28.500> have<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.619> true<00:00:28.800> damage

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
build them tanky and have a true damage

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.009 
build them tanky and have a true damage
ultimate<00:00:29.580> obviously<00:00:30.090> you<00:00:30.330> can<00:00:30.510> do<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.779> same

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
ultimate obviously you can do the same

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.370 
ultimate obviously you can do the same
thing<00:00:31.349> too<00:00:31.650> with<00:00:32.070> Cho<00:00:32.489> Gath<00:00:32.730> but<00:00:33.690> you<00:00:34.260> know

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
thing too with Cho Gath but you know

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.370 
thing too with Cho Gath but you know
he's<00:00:35.070> still<00:00:35.370> not<00:00:35.550> terrible<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.390> if<00:00:37.020> you<00:00:37.170> want

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
he's still not terrible and if you want

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.020 
he's still not terrible and if you want
to<00:00:37.469> take<00:00:37.680> him<00:00:37.800> top<00:00:38.040> lane<00:00:38.250> he<00:00:38.399> doesn't<00:00:38.730> do<00:00:38.850> have

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
to take him top lane he doesn't do have

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.869 
to take him top lane he doesn't do have
bad<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.570> oddly<00:00:40.079> enough<00:00:40.290> he<00:00:41.129> does<00:00:41.309> OK<00:00:41.670> in<00:00:41.790> the

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
bad and oddly enough he does OK in the

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.940 
bad and oddly enough he does OK in the
jungle<00:00:42.270> I<00:00:42.390> have<00:00:42.600> no<00:00:42.899> idea<00:00:42.930> why<00:00:43.440> I<00:00:43.469> think<00:00:43.710> it's

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
jungle I have no idea why I think it's

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.100 
jungle I have no idea why I think it's
just<00:00:43.980> cuz<00:00:44.160> it's<00:00:44.340> clear<00:00:44.550> as<00:00:44.640> decent<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.930> few

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
just cuz it's clear as decent the few

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.690 
just cuz it's clear as decent the few
times<00:00:46.200> I've<00:00:46.500> played<00:00:46.739> in<00:00:46.860> there<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.129> his<00:00:47.309> ganks

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
times I've played in there and his ganks

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.670 
times I've played in there and his ganks
since<00:00:48.329> you<00:00:48.450> can<00:00:48.600> rake<00:00:48.780> people<00:00:49.110> in<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:49.440> aren't

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
since you can rake people in it aren't

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.020 
since you can rake people in it aren't
too<00:00:49.829> bad<00:00:50.010> if<00:00:50.219> they're<00:00:50.340> pushed<00:00:50.579> up<00:00:50.730> in<00:00:50.879> lane

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
too bad if they're pushed up in lane

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.270 
too bad if they're pushed up in lane
it's<00:00:51.239> pretty<00:00:51.420> much<00:00:51.539> easy<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.410> pull<00:00:52.949> them<00:00:53.100> in

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
it's pretty much easy to pull them in

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.680 
it's pretty much easy to pull them in
slow<00:00:53.520> them<00:00:53.640> down<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:53.969> hit<00:00:54.120> him<00:00:54.239> for<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.449> lot<00:00:54.600> of

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
slow them down and hit him for a lot of

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.510 
slow them down and hit him for a lot of
damage<00:00:54.840> so<00:00:55.230> he's<00:00:55.559> not<00:00:55.770> actually<00:00:55.949> terrible<00:00:56.309> for

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
damage so he's not actually terrible for

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.000 
damage so he's not actually terrible for
that<00:00:56.640> role<00:00:56.789> too<00:00:57.000> but<00:00:57.600> still<00:00:58.289> not<00:00:58.410> top<00:00:58.620> tier<00:00:58.859> but

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
that role too but still not top tier but

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.349 
that role too but still not top tier but
