what<00:01:04.820> surprised<00:01:05.300> us<00:01:05.570> most<00:01:05.600> about<00:01:06.050> the<00:01:06.290> CRV<00:01:06.770> is

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
what surprised us most about the CRV is

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.650 
what surprised us most about the CRV is
the<00:01:07.220> way<00:01:07.340> it<00:01:07.520> seems<00:01:07.760> to<00:01:07.880> have<00:01:08.000> loosened<00:01:08.300> up

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:08.660 
the way it seems to have loosened up

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.870 
the way it seems to have loosened up
over<00:01:09.080> the<00:01:09.170> miles<00:01:09.440> that<00:01:09.800> we've<00:01:09.950> put<00:01:10.190> on<00:01:10.340> it<00:01:10.490> not

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
over the miles that we've put on it not

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.330 
over the miles that we've put on it not
necessarily<00:01:11.540> over<00:01:11.930> the<00:01:12.140> first<00:01:12.410> couple<00:01:13.280> of

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
necessarily over the first couple of

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.340 
necessarily over the first couple of
thousand<00:01:13.850> as<00:01:14.030> you'd<00:01:14.240> expect<00:01:14.630> of<00:01:14.810> a<00:01:14.900> car<00:01:15.110> that's

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
thousand as you'd expect of a car that's

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.080 
thousand as you'd expect of a car that's
brand<00:01:15.980> new<00:01:16.070> and<00:01:16.280> running<00:01:16.520> in<00:01:16.640> but<00:01:16.760> actually

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
brand new and running in but actually

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.630 
brand new and running in but actually
all<00:01:17.270> the<00:01:17.780> way<00:01:17.870> up<00:01:18.020> to<00:01:18.200> ten<00:01:18.500> thousand<00:01:19.160> miles<00:01:19.310> it

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
all the way up to ten thousand miles it

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.960 
all the way up to ten thousand miles it
was<00:01:19.760> gradually<00:01:20.600> changing<00:01:21.530> the<00:01:22.010> engine<00:01:22.340> got<00:01:22.910> a

was gradually changing the engine got a

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.910 
was gradually changing the engine got a
little<00:01:23.420> bit<00:01:23.540> quieter<00:01:24.050> and<00:01:24.170> a<00:01:24.200> bit<00:01:24.350> freer

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
little bit quieter and a bit freer

little bit quieter and a bit freer
through<00:01:25.340> the<00:01:25.490> revs<00:01:25.730> our<00:01:26.360> average<00:01:26.930> miles<00:01:27.170> per

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
through the revs our average miles per

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.110 
through the revs our average miles per
gallon<00:01:27.860> went<00:01:28.040> up<00:01:28.190> from<00:01:28.340> about<00:01:28.520> 33<00:01:29.300> to<00:01:29.480> 35<00:01:30.170> and

gallon went up from about 33 to 35 and

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.690 
gallon went up from about 33 to 35 and
mainly<00:01:32.120> this<00:01:32.420> is<00:01:32.860> psychological<00:01:33.860> but<00:01:34.070> it<00:01:34.400> did

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
mainly this is psychological but it did

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.510 
mainly this is psychological but it did
seem<00:01:35.060> to<00:01:35.330> get<00:01:35.510> ever<00:01:35.840> so<00:01:36.200> slightly<00:01:36.470> softer<00:01:37.370> in
