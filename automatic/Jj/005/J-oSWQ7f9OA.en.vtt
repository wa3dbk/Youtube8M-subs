00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.340
 and finally consider a bunch which 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.530
 kicking is catching up that is 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.570
 enemy blocking punches away 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.660
 and you put a circular kick in 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.660
 head 

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:20.160
 remember that is also effective 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.769
 use kicks in combat 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.910
 finishing or chasing the opponent 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:26.330
 outgoing after your series of beats 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.330
 by hands 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.870
 now consider the combinations of another 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.160
 type in this bundle 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.010
 foot is used as 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.540
 a diversion however mostly 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.760
 leg leg ligaments 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.890
 used on the principle of defeat or 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.310
 hand shots after a real strike 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.410
 by foot 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:19.390
 if at the same time the enemy missed him 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.390
 or put the defense on the spot 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.920
 and another option distracting movement 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.200
 foot imitating the beginning of the strike 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.150
 makes the opponent give up and in 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.050
 this moment must be applied 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.050
 punch in the head 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.340
 the following bundles of this subgroup are all 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.370
 kicks should be aimed at 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.590
 real defeat this combination is good 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:52.960
 so that all blows are aimed at defeat 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.960
 all three zones of the lower middle and upper 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.720
 if the bows there you manage to break 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.720
 the balance of the enemy is possible
