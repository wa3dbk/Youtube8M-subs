I already showed how to connect an Xbox One
controller to your PC using a micro USB cable.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.410
Only wired connection is available at the
moment. But how about the new PlayStation

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:20.410
4 controller Dualshock 4? Can you use a PS4
controller to play PC games? Yes you can.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:27.640
Windows 8 and higher can detect it if attached
with a micro USB cable, same as with Xbox

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:33.960
One controller. Windows 8 can also detect
it wirelessly. To do that, your PC must be

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.440
equipped with a Bluetooth module. Then follow
standard Windows 8 procedure to detect a new

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.350
Bluetooth device, and press and hold Share
then PS button on the Dualshock 4 while Windows

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:51.170
searches for it. The Dualshock 4 will blink,
and Windows should detect and connect it.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.219
Follow on-screen instructions to complete
registration. There is a problem though. By

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:02.100
default, Dualshock 4 will be installed as
an older DirectInput device, since Dualshock

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:09.100
4 does not support the newer XInput interface.
XInput is what most modern games want. There

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.859
was a similar problem with older Dualshock
3 controller from PlayStation 3, but good

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:20.979
people wrote a software wrapper which converts
it to a XInput device. This driver has now

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:27.340
been updated to support Dualshock 4, so now
you can use Dualshock 4 as a XInput device

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:33.070
in Windows 8. Windows 7 is a different story
- there have been reports that it drops the

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.320
wireless connection, however a viewer on my
channel confirmed that after installing the

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:44.909
above mentioned software, he can play games
in Windows 7 with DS4 connected wirelessly

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:51.909
for several hours without any issues. Die-hard
fans can even connect the newer PS4 controller

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:59.450
to the old buddy PS3. This is done in a bit
weird way. First you connect the DS4 to PS3

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:07.310
with a micro USB cable, then enter Accessory
Settings in the PS3 menu, select Manage Bluetooth

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.739
devices and start searching for one. While
the console does that, pull out the micro

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:18.629
USB cable and press both Share and PS buttons
on the Dualshock 4. When it blinks, connect

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:25.239
the cable back. PS3 should now detect the
Wireless Controller. Proceed to register it

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:32.239
as usual. After the registration is done,
you can detach the cable and play PS3 games

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:33.590
wirelessly with Dualshock 4.
