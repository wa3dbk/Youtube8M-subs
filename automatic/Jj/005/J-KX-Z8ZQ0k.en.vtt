stripes in the bottom another reason I

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:09.560 
stripes in the bottom another reason I
really<00:06:08.010> like<00:06:08.100> this<00:06:08.370> dress<00:06:08.580> is<00:06:08.820> because<00:06:09.270> it<00:06:09.450> was

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:09.570 
really like this dress is because it was

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:11.780 
really like this dress is because it was
a<00:06:09.780> lot<00:06:10.080> longer<00:06:10.410> than<00:06:10.890> the<00:06:11.070> other<00:06:11.250> ones<00:06:11.550> that<00:06:11.730> I

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:14.010 
usually like to wear and I just thought

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:16.430 
usually like to wear and I just thought
it<00:06:14.160> was<00:06:14.310> a<00:06:14.520> lot<00:06:14.790> more<00:06:15.060> like<00:06:15.270> you<00:06:15.540> know<00:06:15.750> elegant

it was a lot more like you know elegant

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.860 
it was a lot more like you know elegant
because<00:06:16.860> of<00:06:17.070> the<00:06:17.370> length<00:06:17.580> of<00:06:17.820> it<00:06:18.030> it<00:06:18.300> really

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:18.870 
because of the length of it it really

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:21.740 
because of the length of it it really
like<00:06:19.130> accentuates<00:06:20.130> your<00:06:20.340> shape<00:06:20.820> because<00:06:21.450> of

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:21.750 
like accentuates your shape because of

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:23.810 
like accentuates your shape because of
