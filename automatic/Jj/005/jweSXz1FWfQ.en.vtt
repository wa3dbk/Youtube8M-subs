00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.820
 or eight in the established tens 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:04.730
 if you are not offered a license 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.530

 update installed from the center 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.840
 updates without them even wait is not worth it 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.759
 give up to ten 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.119
 so set yourself a pirated windows 7 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:19.009
 or 8 activator and sit wait 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:21.470
 updates like a diode pointless 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:23.390
 even if windows works in pirates 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.299
 update even if it normally downloads 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:29.479
 and even if the system updates this 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:32.899
 maybe but you still won't get 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:35.869
 activated top ten windows 10 so and 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:40.909
 will remain inactive and you need 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:43.869
 will buy a key for money without having 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:46.490

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:55.490
 programs that are forever and get 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.859
 insider version but unstable 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.710
 builds I do not recommend to you 

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:03.109
 updated need to put a clean version 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.600
 windows so as not to drag all the shit out 

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:07.159
 old system again 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.180
 however, to get the keys first 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:13.000
 will have to upgrade to windows 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:15.850
 it is necessary and still necessary to 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.380
 activation has been done after this key 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.150
 it is advisable to pull out using 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.640

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.120
 happening 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.120
 then download the microsoft site image 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.820
 write it to a flash drive or a blank 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.850
 boot and reinstall the system 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:36.340
 clean with formatting the hard drive 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:38.440
 if you are asked to enter a key, skip after 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.870
 installation go to the activation section 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.540
 if you swear at the button go to 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.220

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:49.860
