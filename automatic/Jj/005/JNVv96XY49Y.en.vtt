forge world armored basileus yeah the
only<00:00:24.539> thing<00:00:24.689> that<00:00:24.840> stinks<00:00:25.019> is<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.560> track

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
only thing that stinks is the track

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.439 
only thing that stinks is the track
guards<00:00:26.310> that<00:00:26.430> we<00:00:26.490> actually<00:00:26.609> have<00:00:26.849> go<00:00:27.150> all<00:00:27.330> the

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
guards that we actually have go all the

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.210 
guards that we actually have go all the
way<00:00:27.480> back<00:00:27.539> here<00:00:27.720> but<00:00:28.619> you<00:00:28.710> can't<00:00:28.920> fit<00:00:29.160> them

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
way back here but you can't fit them

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.950 
way back here but you can't fit them
because<00:00:29.519> this<00:00:29.699> comes<00:00:30.090> right<00:00:30.240> up<00:00:30.510> to<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.810> edge

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
because this comes right up to the edge

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.659 
because this comes right up to the edge
right<00:00:31.230> here<00:00:31.289> right<00:00:31.769> so<00:00:32.130> you<00:00:32.189> have<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.430> trim

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
right here right so you have to trim

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.479 
right here right so you have to trim
them<00:00:32.790> off<00:00:32.910> right<00:00:33.180> there<00:00:33.450> obviously<00:00:34.280> you<00:00:35.280> can't

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
them off right there obviously you can't

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.010 
them off right there obviously you can't
actually<00:00:35.640> even<00:00:35.940> fit<00:00:36.120> like<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.540> back<00:00:36.750> section

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020
