00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.830
 no no 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.109
 no no 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.119
 ah 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:25.630
 well first let's take a zoom and 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:27.140
 red color and let's draw a 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:31.730
 rectangle 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:36.430
 12 centimeters wide 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:40.930
 and long of all the juice 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:44.260
 this is to make our cylinder that 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:48.670
 is going to be the base of the sweetie we're going to 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:51.010
 trace and we're going to cut it once we 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.970
 cut it out we're going to take our 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:58.239
 glue me here I have liquid silicone 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:01:02.110
 and we're going to put glue in one of the 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:04.470
 shores like a centimeter or two of 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.470
 width 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.990
 and we are going to join 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.140
 the two shores 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.260
 in this way 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:19.190
 to form our good cylinder already 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:21.800
 that we have it like this we are going to 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:24.730
 and put glue on this part in the 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.730
 bottom part 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:35.990
 let's put enough glue 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:38.660
 and we're going to take another silver in the form of 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.690
 same color I am not in red sign 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.970
 to combine with the apple but you 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.310
 you can do it in another color if you 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.420
 you want 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:52.229
 and we're going to hit it like this 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:55.020
 just like in the other's base and we're going to 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.970
 wait for it to dry perfectly well and 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.030
 and then we're going to cut all the 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:02.189
 excess ok good now let's draw 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.350
 our molds the molds are in the 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.930
 description of the video the manzanita and the 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:10.229
 worm of the manzanita we are going to 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.090
 print 21 we're going to leave it like that 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.530
 let's remove 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.440
 the leaves 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.120
 and we're going to print and we're going to leave it alone 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.000
 the apple and in the other we cut 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:25.030
 apart from the little leaf and the stick I 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.330
 I'm going to draw it in a background 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.800
 red diamond and the little worm I do not have 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.200
 was my green diamond so 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:36.640
 I will only do it in this type of green 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:39.350
 and the little leaf I'll pass it in another color 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.410
 of more intense green 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:45.350
 and your apple has to be more or 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.890
 less according to the width of the 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:51.430
 circumference of your 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:54.520
 a book of your candy that we are going to make 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:58.959
 can be bigger more girl I do not know that 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:01.990
 it looks good just like the worm should be a 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:04.570
 the proportion of the apple we are going to 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.459
 trace and we're going to cut them good already 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.650
 that they cut their molds 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:11.200
 let's put together let's hit the little leaf 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.629
 and the little tail 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:17.610
 to the apple and biological I put it with 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:19.630
 green down because this one that I offer 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:23.550
 this 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:27.160
 the little lines so that it is also seen 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:29.410
 and in the little worm cut a few sticks 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.960
 so they are like their antennas 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:35.170
 this is optional and I also draw you 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:37.430
 some little lines with green down and its 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.319
 little face 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:44.469
 and now look carefully at what we are going to do 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:46.430
 let's put on top our 

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:49.790
 worm 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.700
 and we're going to look roughly half 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:55.060
 of the little worm 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:57.230
 in which we are going to cut it so 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.709
 let's fight it 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.690
 in this way and one of the parties we 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:05.510
 let's paste this side more to the 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:08.870
 shore and another of the parties we are going to 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:11.319
 stick more outwards so that it stays 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:15.110
 like what is happening to him 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:17.209
 Worm through the apple if you 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:22.220
 you want we could also do with a 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:24.430
 cut a crack here in the apple and 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:30.460
 to put 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:32.800
 in the form of the worm so that it remains 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:36.370
 look more real that is going through the 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:38.740
 apple is today that option of yours and good 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:41.380
 let's paste then alcohol I see it 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:44.169
 with liquid silicone you with a glue 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:48.220
 of your preference and good and so we 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:52.360
 it remains me if I brought him here in the apple 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:54.940
 you pass behind the worm and only 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:58.000
 you stick these parts with silicone and 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:00.699
 also from this part of here so that 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.690
 it's like this and now we're going to take 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:06.849
 our candy maker at the base that yes 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:10.360
 you want you can put some ribbon or 

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:12.340
 something to make you look prettier or 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.129
 we request everything from diamond foami 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.660
 it would look better 

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:19.790
 and let's go 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:23.440
 paste it like this in the center 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:23.440
 of our cylinder 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.710
 I'm going to use liquid silicone 

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:34.270
 how 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:37.410
 but what the part where the union is 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.410
 stay behind 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:46.680
 and I'm ready only to put him inside 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:48.930
 a sachet with candy and cookies 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:51.570
 with what you want to me I forgot 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:53.580
 you can buy something to put him but 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.900
 well this is the basic idea of ​​doing 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.580
 this candy 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:59.610
 now for the teacher's day here 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:01.240
 in mexico is May 15 yes but so 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:03.819
 is 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:06.099
 and good is a very nice idea that 

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:07.840
 I hope you like it, you can adapt it to 

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:11.050
 all kinds of education maybe I do not know 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:13.120
 for some birthday you do the same 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:16.270
 cylinder but you change the figurine not 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:18.849
 it can be a hello kitty or it can be 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:20.949
 the high monster logo or the 

00:06:18.849 --> 00:06:23.860
 logo of some superhero for the 

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:25.969
 children and the confectioners serve you for 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:28.369
 your children's parties 

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:30.260
 and for example if you only give your 

00:06:28.369 --> 00:06:33.980
 teacher 

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:36.170
 and then put the sweets in here and he already 

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:40.310
