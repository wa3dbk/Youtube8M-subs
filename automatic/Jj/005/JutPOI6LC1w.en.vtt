 tweet so you have to enter the 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.910
 draw and if guys for me the best 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:01.360
 player of fifa 15 last team is pierre 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:04.299
 emerick aubameyang the perfect player 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.150
 with perfect statistics to be 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:10.560
 good in this rival 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:13.650
 fast strong with maximum speed shot 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.940
 that is, it is incredibly fast but yes 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.790
 that it's true that he lacks that 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.800
 exact skill star and in which 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.050
 it needs to be four skins that if not 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.670
 I had no one to stop him 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.610
 it would cost five million or more because 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.170
 would be the best player in the history of 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.120
 last is a team from the bundesliga 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.980
 pretty clear that soon three 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:35.700
 lions which very well speaking day more 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:40.229
 full of him and good as you see 96 of 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:44.130
 83 dribble rhythm 85 shot 45 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.720
 pass defense 78 and physical 72 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.430
 obviously when I say it 's the best 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.840
 color of the game I want to say yes 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.960
 the statistics that put the cards 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.030
 they are real and even more 96 rhythm 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.920
 obviously he is the fastest player that 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.600
 I have tried in my life, that is, it runs 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.530
 the peels yes it is true that he is missing 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.570
 agility is not the most agile player and more 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:07.320
 that has more balance but good a 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.240
 they run pretty, or they run their own other 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.239
 Dodge test is true he was missing 4 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.080
 corners no more no less 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:15.300
 I really have not bargained with 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.510
 I've been more of p'alante strip to see if 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:21.240
 they stopped us and we were a locomotive of 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.460
 bulla sack and it was very easy to leave the 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.620
 rivals with speed and with dribble 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.260
 they did not use it 85 shot 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.770
 obviously that spectacular shot 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:34.650
 bone power completion but the 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.780
 Amazing longshots is very very billet 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.030
 has a power in the shot or its 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.170
 two legs nor the three d is who 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.880
 it's true that they do not have them but the 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.890
 three of bad land has more 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.500
 has four could even say five 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.780
 I do not know if because it's very good I do not know why 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.230
 what but with the two legs or with the 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.640
 three you understand me has gotten me 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.410
 number of goals already with the one or 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.510
 I was not afraid he has a last one 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:01.050
 It has as milkfish did not match up with 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.760
 two and the 78 of pass true truth is a 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.940
 of the great deeds of this man 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.040
 what's so special about you going by and going 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.810
 running and that pass I feel good that 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.130
 then transmission to the wall with any 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.030
 game that has a minimum pass through 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.740
 example they did a lot 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.530
 assists that hit me hit 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:22.030
 for 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:24.550
 It was the triangle and running and 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:27.490
 run and he took her from the mess with 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:30.520
 the three legs is incredible and 72 of the 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:33.580
 physical my mother what power what strength 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:36.040
 what do you mean, take the ball 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:38.200
 and runs runs runs and came 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.940
 over endorse it separates and follows 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.800
 running and if it arrives and reaching 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.200
 goal because it is very strong is very 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.810
 powerful without any doubt the best 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.660
 player that I have tried is never the 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:52.600
 15 ultimate fifa monster and really 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.190
 It's worth it if it costs a million if 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.470
 costs two well the guy is fine with 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:59.260
 million also the best player that 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.730
 tried and I repeat is very very good your 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.980
 price round on a million playstation and 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.870
 half plus or minus one million on xbox 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.550
 possibly keeps going up going down is 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.019
 very weird because it's number one since 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.239
 you know how is the market that 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:11.920
 soon I will bring a video of that 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:13.060
 market to also talk about this player 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.430
 your ball control 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.900
 its curve has some centers but at 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.220
 centers that this or this man is what 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.410
 good that you have to if you go in band 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.950
 it does not matter if you run the same with the same 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.960
 the medium for the band that diagonally 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.450
 runs a lot always good 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:31.080
 positioned and above all it measures 1 87 by 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:33.390
 20 maximum mana guys try if 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.880

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.920
 to flip the best player I've tried 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.840
 I repeat the best player so nothing 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.790
