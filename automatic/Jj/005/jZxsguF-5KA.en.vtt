to do a whole bunch of tritones here so
instead<00:01:47.810> of<00:01:47.869> doing<00:01:48.080> my<00:01:48.490> 1<00:01:49.899> i'm<00:01:50.899> going<00:01:51.140> to<00:01:51.200> use<00:01:51.470> a

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
instead of doing my 1 i'm going to use a

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.160 
instead of doing my 1 i'm going to use a
little<00:01:52.369> trick<00:01:53.320> called<00:01:54.320> the<00:01:54.470> mediant<00:01:54.950> minor

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
little trick called the mediant minor

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.450 
little trick called the mediant minor
that's<00:01:57.170> not<00:01:57.380> a<00:01:57.410> tritone<00:01:57.800> that's<00:01:58.009> the<00:01:58.190> three

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
that's not a tritone that's the three

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.760 
that's not a tritone that's the three
minor<00:01:58.789> and<00:01:59.119> the<00:02:00.050> three<00:02:00.259> minor<00:02:00.470> is<00:02:00.649> the

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
minor and the three minor is the

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.999 
minor and the three minor is the
equivalent<00:02:01.399> of<00:02:01.700> the<00:02:01.960> 11<00:02:02.960> I<00:02:03.229> can<00:02:03.530> do<00:02:03.619> as<00:02:03.710> a<00:02:03.800> major

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
equivalent of the 11 I can do as a major

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:05.660 
equivalent of the 11 I can do as a major
7th

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670

if<00:02:06.090> I<00:02:06.600> don't<00:02:06.659> want<00:02:06.869> to<00:02:06.930> have<00:02:07.080> this<00:02:07.110> dominant

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
if I don't want to have this dominant

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.809 
if I don't want to have this dominant
sounding<00:02:09.140> so<00:02:10.140> a<00:02:10.170> major<00:02:10.470> seventh<00:02:11.009> if<00:02:11.520> you<00:02:11.700> look

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
sounding so a major seventh if you look

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:17.570 
sounding so a major seventh if you look
at<00:02:11.940> this<00:02:12.980> it's<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.130> same<00:02:14.370> thing<00:02:14.400> as<00:02:16.340> my<00:02:17.340> F

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580

the root is my F sharp minor so we're

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:33.140 
the root is my F sharp minor so we're
going<00:02:23.670> to<00:02:23.760> use<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:24.090> F<00:02:24.239> sharp<00:02:24.450> minor<00:02:24.540> 7<00:02:32.150> and
