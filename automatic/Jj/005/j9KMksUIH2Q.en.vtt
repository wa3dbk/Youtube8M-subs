but<00:05:39.259> they<00:05:39.889> can<00:05:40.039> also<00:05:40.250> try<00:05:40.639> to<00:05:40.699> exchange

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:41.060 
but they can also try to exchange

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:42.730 
but they can also try to exchange
knowledge<00:05:41.599> with<00:05:41.960> the<00:05:42.050> others<00:05:42.349> to<00:05:42.590> develop

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:42.740 
knowledge with the others to develop

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.610 
knowledge with the others to develop
shared<00:05:43.280> mindsets<00:05:44.030> and<00:05:44.150> thereby<00:05:44.750> raise<00:05:45.349> their

intercultural competence a mixture of
