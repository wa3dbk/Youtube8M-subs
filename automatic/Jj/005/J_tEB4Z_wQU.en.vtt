and it's just a great way to stay in
shape<00:00:38.370> was<00:00:39.239> it<00:00:39.360> was<00:00:39.660> this<00:00:39.809> game<00:00:39.960> with<00:00:40.110> the

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
shape was it was this game with the

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.810 
shape was it was this game with the
trigger<00:00:40.410> public<00:00:40.680> somehow<00:00:41.010> defeat<00:00:41.399> different

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
trigger public somehow defeat different

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.910 
trigger public somehow defeat different
from<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.090> first<00:00:42.329> one<00:00:42.450> I<00:00:42.719> would<00:00:43.469> kind<00:00:43.860> of

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
from the first one I would kind of

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:44.779 
from the first one I would kind of
changed<00:00:44.129> it<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.219> little<00:00:44.309> bit<00:00:44.460> we<00:00:44.610> went<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:44.760> little

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
changed it a little bit we went a little

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.510 
changed it a little bit we went a little
bit<00:00:44.940> more<00:00:45.120> defensive<00:00:46.039> but<00:00:47.039> I<00:00:47.070> mean<00:00:47.340> they're<00:00:47.489> a

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
bit more defensive but I mean they're a

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.639 
bit more defensive but I mean they're a
good<00:00:47.670> team<00:00:47.700> so<00:00:48.059> it's<00:00:48.210> I<00:00:48.539> don't<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:49.410> doubt

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
good team so it's I don't that doubt

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:50.869 
good team so it's I don't that doubt
that<00:00:49.920> we<00:00:49.980> were<00:00:50.070> going<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.250> win<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.399> game<00:00:50.579> we

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
that we were going to win the game we

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.299 
that we were going to win the game we
were<00:00:50.940> just<00:00:51.120> hoping<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.860> hold<00:00:52.860> them<00:00:53.010> off<00:00:53.100> and

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
were just hoping to hold them off and

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.900 
were just hoping to hold them off and
just<00:00:53.940> stay<00:00:54.449> in<00:00:54.510> shape<00:00:54.890> you<00:00:55.890> kind<00:00:56.129> of<00:00:56.219> collapsed

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
just stay in shape you kind of collapsed

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
just stay in shape you kind of collapsed
in<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.030> second<00:00:57.390> period<00:00:57.690> what<00:00:58.410> happened<00:00:59.930> I

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
in the second period what happened I

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.630 
in the second period what happened I
guess<00:01:01.530> if<00:01:01.649> I<00:01:01.739> knew<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:01.980> answer<00:01:02.010> that<00:01:02.280> question

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
guess if I knew the answer that question

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.679 
guess if I knew the answer that question
we<00:01:02.820> would<00:01:02.940> have<00:01:03.059> collapsed<00:01:03.680> so<00:01:04.680> I<00:01:05.570> don't<00:01:06.570> know

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
we would have collapsed so I don't know

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.750 
we would have collapsed so I don't know
it's<00:01:06.869> just<00:01:07.100> difficult<00:01:08.100> if<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.430> switch<00:01:08.640> off

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
it's just difficult if you switch off

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.039 
it's just difficult if you switch off
once<00:01:08.970> you<00:01:09.060> get<00:01:09.180> punished<00:01:09.479> so<00:01:09.630> I<00:01:09.659> guess<00:01:09.869> that's

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
once you get punished so I guess that's

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.750 
once you get punished so I guess that's
what<00:01:10.140> happened<00:01:10.380> how<00:01:11.369> are<00:01:11.430> we<00:01:11.490> going<00:01:11.610> to

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
what happened how are we going to

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.590 
what happened how are we going to
motivate<00:01:11.939> yourself

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
motivate yourself

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.570 
motivate yourself
do<00:01:13.110> you<00:01:13.170> need<00:01:13.290> any<00:01:13.470> motivation<00:01:13.979> other<00:01:14.400> than

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
do you need any motivation other than

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.490 
do you need any motivation other than
staying<00:01:14.850> in<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.150> play<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.630> don't<00:01:16.259> think<00:01:16.439> we

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
staying in the play I don't think we

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.020 
staying in the play I don't think we
need<00:01:16.619> any<00:01:16.650> motivation<00:01:17.220> we<00:01:17.369> all<00:01:17.490> knew<00:01:17.700> that<00:01:17.729> we

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
need any motivation we all knew that we

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.210 
need any motivation we all knew that we
were<00:01:18.150> coming<00:01:18.330> here<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.740> sustain<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.830> pool<00:01:20.009> and

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
were coming here to sustain the pool and

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.570 
were coming here to sustain the pool and
Game<00:01:20.729> six<00:01:21.000> was<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.299> game<00:01:21.479> so<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.740> boys<00:01:22.920> are<00:01:23.100> in

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
Game six was the game so the boys are in

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.730 
Game six was the game so the boys are in
shape<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.119> ready<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.299> go<00:01:24.479> I'm<00:01:25.110> surprised<00:01:25.560> that

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
shape and ready to go I'm surprised that

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.620 
shape and ready to go I'm surprised that
the<00:01:25.860> opponent<00:01:26.490> for<00:01:26.790> tomorrow<00:01:27.060> is<00:01:27.210> going<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.540> be

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
not really we thought on paper it would

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.740

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
our chances to finish them yeah

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.540 
our chances to finish them yeah
what<00:01:46.170> happened<00:01:46.500> after<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.040> first<00:01:47.250> period<00:01:47.370> you

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:47.550 
what happened after the first period you

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.790 
what happened after the first period you
kind<00:01:47.850> of<00:01:47.940> collapsed<00:01:48.300> there<00:01:48.450> yeah<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.260> know<00:01:49.770> I

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
kind of collapsed there yeah you know I

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.530 
kind of collapsed there yeah you know I
think<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.340> boss<00:01:50.460> kind<00:01:50.729> switched<00:01:51.090> off<00:01:51.300> a<00:01:51.390> bit

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
think the boss kind switched off a bit

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.810 
think the boss kind switched off a bit
but<00:01:51.960> I<00:01:52.229> guess<00:01:52.530> it<00:01:52.710> in<00:01:52.950> pill<00:01:53.280> there<00:01:53.460> if<00:01:53.700> you

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
but I guess it in pill there if you

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.510 
but I guess it in pill there if you
switch<00:01:54.030> off<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:54.450> get<00:01:54.540> punished<00:01:54.920> hey<00:01:55.920> what<00:01:56.490> are
