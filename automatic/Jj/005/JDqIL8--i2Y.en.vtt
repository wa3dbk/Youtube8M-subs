00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 Hello everyone, once again with us 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.420
 chinese lego and this time it is lego 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.040
 batman is very strange 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.170
 very strange set so i have 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:14.719
 He was interested in the country for several 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:18.890
 first reasons we see Batman here 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:22.470
 remind batman of the universe di si and here everything 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:24.779
 other characters from the Marvel Universe is 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.019
 very strange and secondly what else 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.539
 strange these cards will remind you 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:37.140
 my sad experience with these cards 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:43.980
 I will find now and I will not find 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:45.960
 terrible set I will remind it without without 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.469
 some company without any logo 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.070
 there were cards here too 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:57.360
 the set is terrible right there too cards 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:01:01.289
 shown and there is a lego company here 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.539
 I don’t know this manufacturer’s logo 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.810
 I can't say anything about him today 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.840
 we will find out how he is 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:13.500
 quality substandard and so on 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:16.130
 in general, everything else is interesting here 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:20.729
 incorrectly written ironman 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:24.030
 I thought well, it is peculiar to Chinese 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:27.619
 can't make mistakes for some reason captain 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:32.220
 America is written correctly as 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:33.750
 captain and maybe not but maybe 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.659
 wrong at least hulk 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.409
 correctly written okay it doesn't matter 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:39.409
 let's see what kind of Lego 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:48.220
 bad for good we will make conclusions on this 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:50.800
 companies this ks 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.630
 I do not know how they are read so we 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:56.500
 inside we immediately come across 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:59.950
 instruction instruction after all books 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:03.760
 the form of a large sheet so that 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.470
 stuck but it's pretty easy 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:10.690
 going to remind here not very much 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:13.330
 details so a bag in my one yes 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.540
 one bag with all cable with details 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.630
 well, this is bad and I don’t know myself 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.880
 speaking cards 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.920
 cards sachets that will remind you interesting 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:29.230
 in this stupid set they were without 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:32.190
 bags but these easily acted cards 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:35.080
 just cardboard 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.790
 ordinary it makes no sense to compare with 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.980
 those 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:41.380
 the quality is not the same all the same not 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:45.130
 doesn't have any value so this 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.230
 it does n't matter to us 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:52.300
 big package 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:52.930
 as always I will quickly gather it 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.739
 draw conclusions 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:03:01.630
 Here we have a Batman between 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:04.300
 by the way he they are quite good in quality 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:07.600
 on painting and now I will evaluate 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:10.620
 lego from what moments 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.070
 This is the quality of the details of the quality of painting 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.420
 assembly complexity 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.760
 assembly complexity depends not on 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:20.590
 quantities of parts from how they 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:23.320
 gather that is for example some 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.150
 the parts are very hard to put in and 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.970
 it was necessary to apply some effort 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:31.209
 to collect all the details and the last one 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:34.390
 price of course let's start with quality 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:37.330
 details all details pretty 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.700
 quite good everything moves well 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:44.110
 can take any formula 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:50.590
 any position is quite tolerable and 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:52.600
 well there are no parts but there is nothing 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:57.269
 There is nothing superfluous on the details of course 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:57.269
 There are a couple of moments, but this is already quite 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:03.260
 quite if you already find fault here some 

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:05.200
 there are fragments and here is a small fragment 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:10.750
 but it is quite if you find fault 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:16.220
 quality of parts so let's say for four 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:20.539
 the quality of painting is also so-so 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:22.930
 if you pay attention to the face you can see 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:27.380
 which is not very high quality 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:30.979
 in his eyes, too, can be seen but 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:35.150
 Mostly but here still on the back of the head 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:37.960
 he can be seen badly painted mostly 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:41.050
 he painted very well 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:43.850
 Blema logo I do not know what to call 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:48.260
 the quality of painting is also noted on 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:50.960
 four all the same more or less so 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.889
 the build complexity is pretty much the same 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.310
 some details 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:57.940
 it was necessary to use force that is 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:05:01.880
 really push hard 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:04.610
 several it seems that these are all sets 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:07.010
 designed for children they are not all children 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:09.650
 will be able to apply such efforts that 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:12.710
 As for the price and there is no doubt put 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:15.199
 five quarrel build 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:18.849
 three and a half let it be that 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:22.160
 Regarding the price here but a clean five 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:25.940
 set costs 180 rubles in my total 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:27.320
 only this is very small and the value for money 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.960
 qualities are quite justified 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:32.419
 the set is very cheap and and more or less 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.820
 quality this b there itself is pretty 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:37.940
 big but I have a pretty big hand 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:40.490
 I do not know how to compare but here 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:43.729
 ten-ruble coin but see all 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:48.169
 on the card what they put there 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:49.610
 compare with the turtles cards they 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:52.280
 exactly the same 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:54.770
 only slightly different background 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:57.530
 painting and so they are identical in general to 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:06:00.949
 that's all i would like to tell you 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:03.470
 already more than 500 finally I want everyone 

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:05.900
 say thanks thanks you appear 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:07.940
 some kind of incentive to do something 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:10.669
 pour on the channel and so on in general 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:14.570
 thank you all very much also thank you for 

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:17.509
 View rate the video all bye 

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:19.759
 when I would like to say more Batman 

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:23.330
 will look much better without these 

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:25.190
 I don’t even know that it ’s not like 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:28.009
 didn't cover it like a big mustache 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:31.970
 some kind of insect like this much 

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:35.419
 better looks yes and weapons could 

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:37.070
 come up with some other and I don't know which one 

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:39.889
 Batman's weapon can't even 

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:42.760
 imagine him a lot of different weapons 

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:46.699
 weapons and equipment but mostly all 

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:50.419
 figachil pskov correspondent however this weapon 

00:06:46.699 --> 00:06:53.479
 pretty well done even eat in 

00:06:50.419 --> 00:06:56.389
 this detail the gap between the two parts 

00:06:53.479 --> 00:07:01.000
 well, painted, too, quite quite good 

00:06:56.389 --> 00:07:01.000
 but all this time this is exactly the end
