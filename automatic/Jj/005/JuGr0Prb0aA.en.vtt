eyepiece<00:00:37.010> shapes<00:00:38.010> are<00:00:38.309> what<00:00:38.579> I<00:00:38.610> started<00:00:39.120> with

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
eyepiece shapes are what I started with

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.020 
eyepiece shapes are what I started with
and<00:00:39.600> from<00:00:40.440> there<00:00:40.710> then<00:00:41.160> I<00:00:41.190> added<00:00:41.430> this<00:00:41.760> thing

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
and from there then I added this thing

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.900 
and from there then I added this thing
right<00:00:42.360> here<00:00:42.500> which<00:00:43.500> I<00:00:43.680> squeezed<00:00:44.040> down<00:00:44.309> into<00:00:44.879> a

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
right here which I squeezed down into a

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.930 
right here which I squeezed down into a
very<00:00:45.390> it's<00:00:45.539> actually<00:00:45.870> called<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.289> cone<00:00:46.590> and

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
very it's actually called the cone and

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.910 
very it's actually called the cone and
it<00:00:47.940> I<00:00:48.239> squeezed<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:48.780> down<00:00:48.960> even<00:00:49.170> further<00:00:49.469> so

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
it I squeezed it down even further so

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.400 
it I squeezed it down even further so
it's<00:00:50.070> very<00:00:50.309> narrow<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:51.390> then<00:00:52.230> these<00:00:52.350> two

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
it's very narrow and then these two

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.220 
it's very narrow and then these two
little<00:00:52.770> things<00:00:53.010> go<00:00:53.539> behind<00:00:54.539> those<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.140> those

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
little things go behind those and those

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.080 
little things go behind those and those
were<00:00:55.469> like<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.800> little<00:00:56.039> things<00:00:56.940> that

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
were like the little things that

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.610 
were like the little things that
connected<00:00:57.780> Wally's<00:00:58.500> eyes<00:00:58.680> to<00:01:00.410> the<00:01:01.410> cone

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
connected Wally's eyes to the cone

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.410 
connected Wally's eyes to the cone
basically<00:01:02.340> that<00:01:02.699> was<00:01:02.850> at<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.030> back<00:01:03.270> of<00:01:03.300> him<00:01:03.629> um

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
basically that was at the back of him um

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.960 
basically that was at the back of him um
this<00:01:06.420> makes<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.960> upper<00:01:07.260> part<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:07.770> just<00:01:07.970> to

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
this makes the upper part and just to

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.160 
this makes the upper part and just to
give<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.299> definition<00:01:10.140> I<00:01:10.320> got<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.189> ladder<00:01:11.400> um

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
give it definition I got the ladder um

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.300 
give it definition I got the ladder um
just<00:01:13.170> so<00:01:13.409> it<00:01:13.530> didn't<00:01:13.950> look<00:01:14.130> so<00:01:14.430> empty<00:01:15.049> um<00:01:16.310> this

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
just so it didn't look so empty um this

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.530 
just so it didn't look so empty um this
box<00:01:17.880> makes<00:01:18.420> up<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.810> bulk<00:01:18.840> of<00:01:19.229> his<00:01:19.700> body<00:01:20.700> and

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
box makes up the bulk of his body and

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.749 
box makes up the bulk of his body and
it's<00:01:22.259> been<00:01:22.470> squished<00:01:22.799> so<00:01:23.220> that<00:01:23.400> it's<00:01:23.549> not<00:01:23.700> a

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
it's been squished so that it's not a

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.440 
it's been squished so that it's not a
perfect<00:01:26.759> square<00:01:27.560> these<00:01:28.560> two<00:01:28.890> make<00:01:29.189> up<00:01:29.220> is<00:01:29.700> the

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
perfect square these two make up is the

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.899 
perfect square these two make up is the
Medora<00:01:30.810> like<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.400> big<00:01:32.400> part<00:01:32.700> of<00:01:32.880> his<00:01:33.060> arms<00:01:34.909> and

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
Medora like the big part of his arms and

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.179 
Medora like the big part of his arms and
then<00:01:36.509> this<00:01:36.750> goes<00:01:37.079> right<00:01:37.320> here<00:01:37.350> even<00:01:38.040> though

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
then this goes right here even though

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.160 
then this goes right here even though
the<00:01:38.610> rest<00:01:38.850> of<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.150> letters<00:01:39.329> are<00:01:39.720> back<00:01:39.960> there

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
the rest of the letters are back there

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.920 
the rest of the letters are back there
and<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.530> reason<00:01:40.920> this<00:01:41.220> red<00:01:41.520> circle<00:01:41.790> that<00:01:42.600> goes

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
and the reason this red circle that goes

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.359 
and the reason this red circle that goes
behind<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.560> e<00:01:43.619> is<00:01:44.009> right<00:01:44.549> there<00:01:44.790> is<00:01:45.030> because

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
behind the e is right there is because

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:52.730 
behind the e is right there is because
his<00:01:47.369> tire<00:01:48.270> not<00:01:48.720> tires<00:01:49.049> but<00:01:49.380> his<00:01:49.970> tracks<00:01:51.740> need

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
his tire not tires but his tracks need

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.660 
his tire not tires but his tracks need
to<00:01:52.860> cover<00:01:53.070> up<00:01:53.310> part<00:01:53.610> of<00:01:53.700> that<00:01:53.820> ye<00:01:54.740> and<00:01:55.740> you

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
to cover up part of that ye and you

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.899 
to cover up part of that ye and you
built<00:01:56.969> those<00:01:57.210> with<00:01:57.600> just<00:01:58.439> so<00:01:58.619> you<00:01:58.680> know<00:01:58.890> the

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
monolith emblem which is under the Tools

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.940

and then this makes his arm on the other
one<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.959> one<00:02:10.110> that's<00:02:10.289> waving<00:02:10.709> arm<00:02:12.410> and<00:02:14.030> this

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
piece right here makes the back of its

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.039 
piece right here makes the back of its
hand<00:02:17.010> for<00:02:17.280> that<00:02:17.430> one<00:02:17.640> and<00:02:17.849> in<00:02:18.629> the<00:02:18.750> front<00:02:18.930> of

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.759 
because he only has three appendages but
this<00:02:26.849> one<00:02:27.030> I<00:02:27.060> squeezed<00:02:28.019> that<00:02:28.170> one<00:02:28.349> of<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.560> tube

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
this one I squeezed that one of the tube

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:32.990 
this one I squeezed that one of the tube
to<00:02:29.099> save<00:02:29.400> a<00:02:29.430> layer<00:02:29.700> and<00:02:30.620> then<00:02:31.620> his<00:02:31.980> his<00:02:32.489> hand

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
to save a layer and then his his hand

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.670 
to save a layer and then his his hand
out<00:02:33.209> here<00:02:33.420> in<00:02:33.510> front<00:02:33.750> in<00:02:33.959> order<00:02:34.200> to<00:02:34.319> give<00:02:34.530> it

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
out here in front in order to give it

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.680 
out here in front in order to give it
sort<00:02:35.370> of<00:02:35.459> definition<00:02:36.060> make<00:02:36.239> it<00:02:36.390> look<00:02:36.540> like

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
sort of definition make it look like

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.160 
sort of definition make it look like
Wally's<00:02:37.019> hand<00:02:37.349> it<00:02:37.620> takes<00:02:38.180> four<00:02:39.180> separate

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
Wally's hand it takes four separate

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.380 
Wally's hand it takes four separate
little<00:02:40.709> boxes<00:02:41.400> things<00:02:41.730> that<00:02:42.060> you<00:02:42.120> kind<00:02:42.269> of

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
little boxes things that you kind of

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.180 
little boxes things that you kind of
have<00:02:42.510> to<00:02:42.540> just<00:02:42.690> resize<00:02:43.260> and<00:02:43.650> get<00:02:43.769> them<00:02:43.860> so<00:02:44.069> they

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
have to just resize and get them so they

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.460 
have to just resize and get them so they
fit<00:02:44.430> so<00:02:44.459> there's<00:02:44.879> a<00:02:44.940> little<00:02:45.180> gap<00:02:46.079> in<00:02:46.349> between

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
fit so there's a little gap in between

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.080 
got like three or four beloved robots
that<00:03:44.940> I<00:03:45.000> want<00:03:45.209> to<00:03:45.239> try<00:03:45.450> and<00:03:45.569> make<00:03:45.720> but<00:03:47.090> there's

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
that I want to try and make but there's

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.930 
that I want to try and make but there's
Wally<00:03:48.419> it's<00:03:49.079> not<00:03:49.200> the<00:03:49.380> greatest<00:03:49.470> and<00:03:50.130> it<00:03:50.819> does

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
Wally it's not the greatest and it does

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.000 
Wally it's not the greatest and it does
take<00:03:51.150> every<00:03:51.660> little<00:03:51.900> layer<00:03:52.079> to<00:03:52.410> make<00:03:52.560> him<00:03:52.769> and

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
take every little layer to make him and

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.599 
take every little layer to make him and
make<00:03:53.549> him<00:03:53.700> look<00:03:53.849> like<00:03:53.910> that<00:03:54.269> so<00:03:55.280> you<00:03:56.280> can<00:03:56.400> tell

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:56.609 
make him look like that so you can tell

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:59.000 
make him look like that so you can tell
you<00:03:56.790> try<00:03:57.060> taking<00:03:57.239> some<00:03:57.450> things<00:03:57.870> out<00:03:58.049> but<00:03:58.950> I

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
you try taking some things out but I

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.520 
you try taking some things out but I
think<00:03:59.280> it<00:03:59.579> would<00:03:59.730> actually<00:03:59.760> end<00:04:00.450> up<00:04:01.169> looking

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
think it would actually end up looking

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.770 
think it would actually end up looking
worse<00:04:01.560> so<00:04:02.069> I<00:04:02.669> tried<00:04:03.359> a<00:04:03.389> bunch<00:04:03.569> of<00:04:03.720> different

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
worse so I tried a bunch of different

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.690 
worse so I tried a bunch of different
things<00:04:04.169> and<00:04:04.410> think<00:04:04.950> this<00:04:05.099> is<00:04:05.250> the<00:04:05.370> best<00:04:05.489> that

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
things and think this is the best that

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:06.559 
things and think this is the best that
can<00:04:05.819> make<00:04:05.940> him<00:04:06.090> look

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:06.569 
can make him look

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:10.400 
can make him look
so<00:04:07.400> enjoy
