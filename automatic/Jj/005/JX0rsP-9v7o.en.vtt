00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
up the lower looper thread which is the

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.370 
up the lower looper thread which is the
red<00:02:02.939> markings<00:02:03.570> is<00:02:03.869> that<00:02:04.799> sometimes<00:02:06.380> this

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
red markings is that sometimes this

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.210 
red markings is that sometimes this
thread<00:02:07.770> here<00:02:08.160> is<00:02:09.140> placed<00:02:10.140> underneath<00:02:10.770> this

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
thread here is placed underneath this

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.410 
thread here is placed underneath this
bar

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
bar

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.710 
bar
that<00:02:12.599> is<00:02:12.870> incorrect<00:02:13.290> the<00:02:14.280> thread<00:02:14.730> should<00:02:15.450> lay

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
that is incorrect the thread should lay

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.130 
that is incorrect the thread should lay
on<00:02:15.990> top<00:02:16.260> of<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.709> bar<00:02:16.890> and<00:02:17.250> then<00:02:18.239> when

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
on top of the bar and then when

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.750 
on top of the bar and then when
threading<00:02:20.780> this<00:02:21.780> guide<00:02:22.110> here<00:02:22.530> you<00:02:23.370> thread<00:02:23.730> it

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
threading this guide here you thread it

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:34.970 
threading this guide here you thread it
from<00:02:24.180> back<00:02:24.630> to<00:02:25.400> front<00:02:30.380> like<00:02:31.380> that<00:02:33.650> another<00:02:34.650> tip

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
from back to front like that another tip

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.760 
from back to front like that another tip
is<00:02:35.160> that<00:02:35.489> when<00:02:35.760> you're<00:02:35.910> threading<00:02:36.330> up<00:02:36.770> it's

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
is that when you're threading up it's

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.130 
is that when you're threading up it's
always<00:02:38.040> a<00:02:38.430> good<00:02:38.760> idea<00:02:38.790> to<00:02:39.150> use<00:02:39.569> the<00:02:39.810> tweezers

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
always a good idea to use the tweezers

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:47.390 
always a good idea to use the tweezers
as<00:02:40.739> well<00:02:41.370> as<00:02:41.519> your<00:02:41.730> hands<00:02:45.140> you<00:02:46.140> also<00:02:46.440> can<00:02:47.040> see

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
as well as your hands you also can see

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.059 
as well as your hands you also can see
that<00:02:47.880> the<00:02:48.060> upper<00:02:48.510> knife<00:02:48.750> has<00:02:49.200> been<00:02:49.440> moved<00:02:49.709> into

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
that the upper knife has been moved into

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:55.100 
that the upper knife has been moved into
an<00:02:50.610> upward<00:02:51.180> position<00:02:53.480> when<00:02:54.480> this<00:02:54.630> is<00:02:54.810> out<00:02:55.080> of

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
an upward position when this is out of

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.000 
an upward position when this is out of
the<00:02:55.290> way<00:02:55.470> it<00:02:55.799> makes<00:02:55.830> threading<00:02:56.700> up<00:02:56.880> easier

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
the way it makes threading up easier

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.500 
the way it makes threading up easier
when<00:02:59.010> threading<00:02:59.430> up<00:02:59.549> the<00:02:59.700> needle<00:03:00.090> it<00:03:00.299> is

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
when threading up the needle it is

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.979 
when threading up the needle it is
easier<00:03:01.019> when<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.530> presser<00:03:01.830> foot<00:03:02.100> is<00:03:02.340> lowered

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
easier when the presser foot is lowered

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.900 
easier when the presser foot is lowered
once<00:03:03.989> threaded<00:03:04.560> from<00:03:04.799> the<00:03:04.950> front<00:03:05.459> to<00:03:05.580> back

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
once threaded from the front to back

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.320 
once threaded from the front to back
lift<00:03:06.510> up<00:03:06.660> the<00:03:06.810> presser<00:03:06.840> foot<00:03:07.380> which

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
lift up the presser foot which

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.199 
lift up the presser foot which
disengages<00:03:09.330> the<00:03:09.360> tension<00:03:10.019> as<00:03:10.580> each<00:03:11.580> thread<00:03:11.970> is

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
disengages the tension as each thread is

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.320 
disengages the tension as each thread is
threaded<00:03:12.870> it<00:03:13.140> must<00:03:13.980> be<00:03:14.130> passed<00:03:14.519> under<00:03:15.299> the

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
threaded it must be passed under the
