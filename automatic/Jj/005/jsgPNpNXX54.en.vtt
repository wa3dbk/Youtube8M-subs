hey<00:00:01.319> there<00:00:01.530> we're<00:00:01.740> gonna<00:00:01.800> start<00:00:02.100> making<00:00:02.220> some

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
hey there we're gonna start making some

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.960 
hey there we're gonna start making some
rims<00:00:02.669> they're<00:00:03.090> gonna<00:00:03.300> look<00:00:03.540> just<00:00:03.600> like<00:00:04.200> this

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:04.970 
rims they're gonna look just like this

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.980 
rims they're gonna look just like this
all<00:00:05.970> right<00:00:06.150> um<00:00:07.109> so<00:00:08.269> there's<00:00:09.269> a<00:00:09.360> couple<00:00:09.630> ways<00:00:09.809> to

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
all right um so there's a couple ways to

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:20.000 
all right um so there's a couple ways to
do<00:00:10.469> this<00:00:10.769> but<00:00:17.869> you<00:00:18.869> know<00:00:18.990> we've<00:00:19.230> got<00:00:19.410> this

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
do this but you know we've got this

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.200 
do this but you know we've got this
backsides<00:00:20.609> all<00:00:20.880> hollowed<00:00:21.330> out<00:00:23.029> so<00:00:24.029> we're

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
backsides all hollowed out so we're

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:32.479 
backsides all hollowed out so we're
going<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.390> create<00:00:24.600> a<00:00:24.689> part<00:00:25.109> file<00:00:25.789> and<00:00:31.489> we're

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
going to create a part file and we're

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.260 
going to create a part file and we're
going<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:32.730> do<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:33.300> circle<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:35.030> that<00:00:36.030> first

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
going to do a circle and that first

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.250 
going to do a circle and that first
circle<00:00:36.660> is<00:00:36.719> going<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.899> be<00:00:36.989> point<00:00:37.380> four<00:00:37.710> four

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
circle is going to be point four four

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.090 
circle is going to be point four four
all<00:00:40.260> right<00:00:40.320> now<00:00:40.590> we're<00:00:40.710> going<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.860> use<00:00:40.980> an

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
all right now we're going to use an

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.639 
all right now we're going to use an
offset<00:00:41.280> tool<00:00:41.730> we<00:00:41.940> have<00:00:42.059> used<00:00:42.329> this<00:00:42.510> much<00:00:42.780> so

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
offset tool we have used this much so

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.500 
offset tool we have used this much so
we're<00:00:43.770> going<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:43.980> use<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.460> offset<00:00:44.910> tool<00:00:45.149> and

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
we're going to use the offset tool and

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.389 
we're going to use the offset tool and
you're<00:00:45.809> going<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.079> bring<00:00:46.379> it<00:00:46.590> click<00:00:47.160> on<00:00:47.250> your

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
you're going to bring it click on your

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.630 
you're going to bring it click on your
circle<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:48.000> go<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.149> point<00:00:48.420> zero<00:00:48.660> five<00:00:49.640> all

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
circle and go to point zero five all

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:57.910 
circle and go to point zero five all
right<00:00:51.079> then<00:00:52.079> you<00:00:52.289> are<00:00:52.440> going<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:53.129> offset<00:00:54.530> this

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.729 

point<00:00:58.920> three<00:00:59.219> five<00:00:59.430> and<00:01:00.379> then<00:01:01.379> you're<00:01:01.559> going

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
point three five and then you're going

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:08.390 
point three five and then you're going
to<00:01:01.949> offset<00:01:02.480> that<00:01:04.070> point<00:01:05.070> zero<00:01:05.369> five<00:01:07.340> all<00:01:08.340> right

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
to offset that point zero five all right

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.969 
to offset that point zero five all right
so<00:01:08.720> if<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:10.049> know<00:01:10.290> what<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.500> wheel<00:01:10.619> looks<00:01:10.860> like

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
so if you know what the wheel looks like

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.740 
so if you know what the wheel looks like
I<00:01:11.130> think<00:01:11.549> you<00:01:11.640> can<00:01:11.790> start<00:01:12.030> getting<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:12.360> good

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
I think you can start getting a good

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.020 
I think you can start getting a good
view<00:01:13.200> of<00:01:13.260> it<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.619> good<00:01:13.920> imagination<00:01:14.490> of<00:01:14.850> it

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
view of it a good imagination of it

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.490 
view of it a good imagination of it
you've<00:01:15.180> got<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.360> outside<00:01:15.869> of<00:01:16.170> it<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.350> the

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
you've got the outside of it and the

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.039 
you've got the outside of it and the
inside<00:01:16.920> of<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.220> wheel<00:01:17.540> alright<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.750> that<00:01:18.900> was

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
inside of the wheel alright and that was

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.960 
inside of the wheel alright and that was
using<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.530> offset<00:01:20.040> tool<00:01:20.250> which<00:01:20.640> is<00:01:20.759> pretty

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
using the offset tool which is pretty

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.640 
using the offset tool which is pretty
handy<00:01:21.799> all<00:01:22.799> right<00:01:23.189> so<00:01:23.820> I'll<00:01:24.360> finish<00:01:24.960> my<00:01:25.290> sketch

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
handy all right so I'll finish my sketch

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.990 
handy all right so I'll finish my sketch
and<00:01:27.020> I<00:01:28.020> will<00:01:28.320> extrude<00:01:29.009> this<00:01:29.520> I'm<00:01:29.820> going<00:01:29.939> to

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
and I will extrude this I'm going to

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.380 
and I will extrude this I'm going to
extrude<00:01:30.299> this<00:01:31.049> small<00:01:31.950> ring<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.640> this<00:01:33.090> outer

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
extrude this small ring and this outer

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:42.080 
extrude this small ring and this outer
ring<00:01:34.280> and<00:01:35.280> that<00:01:35.700> wants<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.210> be<00:01:36.360> 0.5<00:01:41.030> there<00:01:42.030> you

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
ring and that wants to be 0.5 there you

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.499 
ring and that wants to be 0.5 there you
go<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:42.420> looks<00:01:42.540> right<00:01:42.890> go<00:01:43.890> ahead<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.520> green

go that looks right go ahead and green

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.679 
go that looks right go ahead and green
check<00:01:45.720> that<00:01:46.850> okay<00:01:47.850> so<00:01:48.329> now<00:01:48.479> we<00:01:48.540> want<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.110> add

check that okay so now we want to add

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:53.810 
check that okay so now we want to add
the<00:01:51.689> outside<00:01:52.290> of<00:01:52.530> it<00:01:52.649> so<00:01:52.829> we're<00:01:53.610> going<00:01:53.700> to

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
the outside of it so we're going to

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.600 
the outside of it so we're going to
click<00:01:54.000> on<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.240> face<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:55.049> I<00:01:55.920> want<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.189> create<00:01:56.549> a

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
click on the face and I want to create a

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.149 
click on the face and I want to create a
sketch<00:01:57.049> and<00:01:58.049> I'm<00:01:58.200> going<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.380> project<00:01:58.649> my

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
sketch and I'm going to project my

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.399 
sketch and I'm going to project my
geometry<00:01:59.460> so<00:02:00.060> I'm<00:02:00.149> going<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.329> click<00:02:00.630> there<00:02:00.930> I'm

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
geometry so I'm going to click there I'm

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.429 
geometry so I'm going to click there I'm
going<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.649> click<00:02:01.829> there<00:02:02.840> some<00:02:03.840> of<00:02:03.990> you<00:02:04.170> might

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
going to click there some of you might

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.670 
going to click there some of you might
have<00:02:05.000> liked<00:02:06.000> click<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.540> line<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:07.229> then

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
have liked click the line and then

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.169 
have liked click the line and then
you're<00:02:07.860> doing<00:02:08.039> more<00:02:08.280> work<00:02:08.459> clicking<00:02:08.940> for

all right hit finished sketch because

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.680 
all right hit finished sketch because
the<00:02:21.740> projection<00:02:22.130> geometry<00:02:22.190> just<00:02:22.790> draws<00:02:23.420> it

I create this and I want to extrude that

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.600 
I create this and I want to extrude that
but<00:02:32.360> I<00:02:32.780> do<00:02:33.530> not<00:02:33.860> want<00:02:34.040> to<00:02:34.100> extrude<00:02:34.370> it<00:02:34.460> that

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
but I do not want to extrude it that

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:35.020 
but I do not want to extrude it that
much

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
much
