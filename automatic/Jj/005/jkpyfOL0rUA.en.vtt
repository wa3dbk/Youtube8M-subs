you know I see two sides of it surf is a
really<00:00:33.110> tight<00:00:33.320> community<00:00:33.770> and<00:00:34.010> I<00:00:34.100> think<00:00:34.130> every

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:34.700 
really tight community and I think every

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.400 
really tight community and I think every

when I was in LA saying I'm going to the
Mintos<00:00:39.109> everyone<00:00:39.769> would<00:00:39.890> say<00:00:40.010> where<00:00:40.250> and

I hope with my music that I can kind of

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:48.220 
I hope with my music that I can kind of
branch<00:00:46.460> out<00:00:46.670> and<00:00:46.850> share<00:00:47.629> with<00:00:47.749> some<00:00:48.019> of<00:00:48.109> those

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
branch out and share with some of those

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.950 
branch out and share with some of those
other<00:00:48.679> communities<00:00:48.949> that<00:00:49.730> don't<00:00:49.940> surf<00:00:50.269> what
