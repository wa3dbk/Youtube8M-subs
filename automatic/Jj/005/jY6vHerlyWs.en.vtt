Rubik's Cube side on here actually we'll

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:45.470 
Rubik's Cube side on here actually we'll
see<00:00:40.309> all<00:00:41.309> right<00:00:42.350> animation<00:00:43.350> I<00:00:43.879> have<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.120> twist

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
see all right animation I have the twist

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.090 
see all right animation I have the twist
duration<00:00:46.170> of<00:00:46.379> bowland<00:00:48.140> if<00:00:49.140> you<00:00:49.710> put<00:00:49.920> it<00:00:50.010> on

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
duration of bowland if you put it on

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.950 
duration of bowland if you put it on
like<00:00:50.340> twist<00:00:50.730> duration<00:00:51.210> on<00:00:51.300> zero<00:00:53.449> it<00:00:54.449> just<00:00:54.719> kind

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
like twist duration on zero it just kind

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.150 
like twist duration on zero it just kind
of<00:00:55.020> clicks<00:00:56.300> that<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:57.570> don't<00:00:57.750> like<00:00:58.160> it's

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
of clicks that you don't like it's

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.680 
of clicks that you don't like it's
automatically<00:00:59.699> they<00:00:59.910> kinda<00:01:00.180> like<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.390> touch

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
automatically they kinda like a touch

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.890 
automatically they kinda like a touch
keeping<00:01:01.289> this<00:01:03.710> so<00:01:04.710> if<00:01:05.309> there's<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:06.600> they

keeping this so if there's that they

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.289 
keeping this so if there's that they
have<00:01:07.580> pocket<00:01:08.580> cube<00:01:08.970> here<00:01:09.299> in<00:01:09.450> 10<00:01:09.600> seconds<00:01:10.110> oh

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
have pocket cube here in 10 seconds oh

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:13.520 
have pocket cube here in 10 seconds oh

and<00:01:52.110> stuff<00:01:53.420> v-cube<00:01:54.420> seven<00:01:54.869> white<00:01:55.079> I<00:01:56.270> don't

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
and stuff v-cube seven white I don't

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.110 
and stuff v-cube seven white I don't
know<00:01:57.509> what's<00:01:57.689> so<00:01:57.899> different<00:01:58.469> about<00:01:58.860> this

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:00.120 
know what's so different about this

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.560 
know what's so different about this
Oh<00:02:00.920> different<00:02:01.920> color<00:02:02.220> scheme<00:02:02.880> I<00:02:02.910> guess<00:02:03.300> it's

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
Oh different color scheme I guess it's

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.090 
Oh different color scheme I guess it's
kind<00:02:03.780> of<00:02:03.810> like<00:02:03.930> inverted<00:02:04.500> I<00:02:04.620> guess<00:02:04.830> because

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
kind of like inverted I guess because

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.100 
kind of like inverted I guess because
I'm<00:02:05.580> normal<00:02:06.060> Rubik's<00:02:06.330> Cube<00:02:06.570> it's<00:02:06.720> red<00:02:06.900> white

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
I'm normal Rubik's Cube it's red white

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.680 
I'm normal Rubik's Cube it's red white
and<00:02:07.260> blue<00:02:07.670> but<00:02:08.670> this<00:02:08.790> here<00:02:09.090> it's<00:02:09.210> red<00:02:09.450> blue<00:02:09.660> and

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
and blue but this here it's red blue and

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:16.850 
and blue but this here it's red blue and
white<00:02:10.020> and<00:02:10.400> uh<00:02:13.370> yeah<00:02:14.370> so<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:15.450> cube<00:02:16.290> is<00:02:16.380> kind<00:02:16.770> of

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
white and uh yeah so the cube is kind of

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.300 
white and uh yeah so the cube is kind of
I<00:02:17.100> don't<00:02:17.970> know<00:02:18.260> just<00:02:19.260> different<00:02:19.680> color<00:02:20.040> scheme

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
I don't know just different color scheme
