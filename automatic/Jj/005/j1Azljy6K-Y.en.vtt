welcome to my third altra wellness blog

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:21.260 
welcome to my third altra wellness blog
the<00:00:19.919> last<00:00:20.130> two<00:00:20.340> weeks<00:00:20.520> we<00:00:20.640> talked<00:00:20.880> about<00:00:21.000> the

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
the last two weeks we talked about the

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.909 
the last two weeks we talked about the
true<00:00:21.539> origins<00:00:21.570> of<00:00:22.169> disease<00:00:22.470> and<00:00:22.800> how

00:00:22.909 --> 00:00:22.919 
true origins of disease and how

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:24.439 
true origins of disease and how
important<00:00:23.369> environmental<00:00:23.759> stressors<00:00:24.270> are

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
important environmental stressors are

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.950 
important environmental stressors are
such<00:00:24.989> as<00:00:25.169> diet<00:00:25.469> exercise<00:00:26.160> stress<00:00:27.090> toxins<00:00:27.809> and

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
such as diet exercise stress toxins and

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.510 
such as diet exercise stress toxins and
trauma<00:00:28.169> and<00:00:28.410> how<00:00:28.680> those<00:00:28.800> set<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.219> stage<00:00:29.489> for

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:29.520 
trauma and how those set the stage for

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.400 
trauma and how those set the stage for
disease<00:00:30.029> today<00:00:30.719> we're<00:00:30.899> going<00:00:30.989> to<00:00:31.079> cover<00:00:31.290> a

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
disease today we're going to cover a

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.280 
disease today we're going to cover a
critical<00:00:32.189> system<00:00:32.870> inflammation<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.079> immune

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
critical system inflammation and immune

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.139 
critical system inflammation and immune
balance<00:00:34.829> this<00:00:34.980> is<00:00:35.160> a<00:00:35.190> core<00:00:35.610> system<00:00:35.820> in<00:00:36.090> the

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
balance this is a core system in the

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.150 
balance this is a core system in the
body<00:00:36.360> that<00:00:36.870> underlies<00:00:37.320> almost<00:00:37.530> all<00:00:37.829> disease

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
body that underlies almost all disease

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.760 
body that underlies almost all disease
okay<00:00:38.640> so<00:00:38.910> what's<00:00:39.270> this<00:00:39.480> simple<00:00:40.289> blood<00:00:40.469> test

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
okay so what's this simple blood test

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:41.660 
okay so what's this simple blood test
that<00:00:40.890> can<00:00:41.010> save<00:00:41.340> your<00:00:41.460> life

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
it's called c-reactive protein and it's

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.120 
it's called c-reactive protein and it's
more<00:00:45.780> important<00:00:46.200> than<00:00:46.230> cholesterol<00:00:46.920> or<00:00:47.100> blood

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:47.130 
more important than cholesterol or blood

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:48.979 
more important than cholesterol or blood
pressure<00:00:47.520> or<00:00:48.090> any<00:00:48.270> other<00:00:48.480> test<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:48.870> could

dementia<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.310> cancer<00:00:53.700> and<00:00:53.880> it's<00:00:54.510> about

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
dementia and cancer and it's about

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.600 
dementia and cancer and it's about
hitting<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.200> inflammation<00:00:55.530> it's<00:00:56.250> not<00:00:56.430> the

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
hitting the inflammation it's not the

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.760 
hitting the inflammation it's not the
inflammation<00:00:57.239> that<00:00:57.630> you<00:00:57.810> know<00:00:57.989> about<00:00:58.260> when

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:26.760 
to inflammation and these are because we

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.910 
to inflammation and these are because we
have<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:26.940> fire<00:01:27.390> going<00:01:27.690> out<00:01:28.229> of<00:01:28.350> control<00:01:28.710> within

we need to extinguish the fire and we

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.430 
we need to extinguish the fire and we

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
current approach are backwards we use

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.820 
current approach are backwards we use
anti-inflammatories<00:01:39.630> like<00:01:39.810> advil<00:01:40.650> and

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
anti-inflammatories like advil and

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
medicine you know walk upstream find out

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.670 
medicine you know walk upstream find out
what's<00:02:39.299> going<00:02:39.569> on<00:02:39.720> and<00:02:39.900> you<00:02:40.260> have<00:02:40.440> to<00:02:40.560> be<00:02:40.620> able

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
what's going on and you have to be able

what's going on and you have to be able

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
to think about these problems

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.270 
to think about these problems
differently<00:02:42.299> so<00:02:42.840> the<00:02:42.989> new<00:02:43.140> medicine<00:02:43.470> is<00:02:43.799> not

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
differently so the new medicine is not

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.819 
differently so the new medicine is not
about<00:02:44.610> a<00:02:44.909> refined<00:02:45.720> diagnostic<00:02:46.409> system<00:02:46.709> it's

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
about a refined diagnostic system it's

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:48.589 
about a refined diagnostic system it's
about<00:02:47.010> a<00:02:47.069> whole<00:02:47.370> new<00:02:47.579> way<00:02:47.760> of<00:02:47.790> thinking<00:02:47.940> about

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
about a whole new way of thinking about

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:50.690 
about a whole new way of thinking about
problems<00:02:48.930> and<00:02:49.409> thinking<00:02:50.159> about<00:02:50.280> inflammation

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
problems and thinking about inflammation

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.670 
problems and thinking about inflammation
is<00:02:51.180> at<00:02:51.329> the<00:02:51.450> root<00:02:51.720> of<00:02:51.870> this<00:02:52.260> new<00:02:52.500> way<00:02:52.650> of

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
is at the root of this new way of

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.190 
is at the root of this new way of
thinking<00:02:53.129> so<00:02:53.280> what<00:02:54.269> are<00:02:54.359> these<00:02:54.450> triggers<00:02:54.989> for

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
thinking so what are these triggers for

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.839 
thinking so what are these triggers for
inflammation<00:02:55.470> what<00:02:56.220> are<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:56.400> things<00:02:56.700> that

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
inflammation what are the things that

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:59.119 
inflammation what are the things that
cause<00:02:57.150> inflammation<00:02:57.599> and<00:02:58.079> how<00:02:58.560> do<00:02:58.620> we<00:02:58.859> get<00:02:59.099> rid

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129 
cause inflammation and how do we get rid

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:02.149 
cause inflammation and how do we get rid
of<00:02:59.459> them<00:02:59.609> and<00:02:59.930> and<00:03:00.930> once<00:03:01.109> we<00:03:01.290> do<00:03:01.470> that<00:03:01.680> how<00:03:02.099> do

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:02.159 
of them and and once we do that how do

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:04.309 
of them and and once we do that how do
we<00:03:02.370> then<00:03:02.519> support<00:03:03.090> our<00:03:03.269> body's<00:03:03.690> natural

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
we then support our body's natural

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.339 
we then support our body's natural
immune<00:03:05.129> system<00:03:05.579> how<00:03:06.150> do<00:03:06.209> we<00:03:06.359> get<00:03:06.510> our<00:03:06.599> balance

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:07.349 
immune system how do we get our balance

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:09.470 
immune system how do we get our balance
back<00:03:07.560> in<00:03:07.769> our<00:03:07.889> immune<00:03:08.010> system<00:03:08.459> so<00:03:08.909> so<00:03:09.239> let's

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
back in our immune system so so let's

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.119 
back in our immune system so so let's
talk<00:03:09.629> for<00:03:09.810> a<00:03:09.870> minute<00:03:09.930> about<00:03:10.109> the<00:03:10.349> causes<00:03:10.769> the
