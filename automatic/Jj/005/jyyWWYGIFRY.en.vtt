started using this foundation my skin

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.350 
started using this foundation my skin
actually<00:00:55.440> did<00:00:55.829> clear<00:00:56.219> up<00:00:56.430> more<00:00:57.030> than<00:00:57.210> just

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
actually did clear up more than just

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.630 
actually did clear up more than just
hiding<00:00:57.719> spots<00:00:58.020> I<00:00:58.260> found<00:00:58.559> that<00:00:58.859> this<00:00:59.070> was

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
hiding spots I found that this was

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.330 
hiding spots I found that this was
making<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.390> spots<00:01:00.690> go<00:01:01.289> away<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:02.010> one<00:01:02.190> thing

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
making the spots go away the one thing

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.650 
making the spots go away the one thing
that<00:01:02.399> I've<00:01:02.550> noticed<00:01:02.579> is<00:01:03.030> that<00:01:03.059> it<00:01:03.300> doesn't

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
that I've noticed is that it doesn't

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.030 
that I've noticed is that it doesn't
tend<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:03.989> stay<00:01:04.170> all<00:01:04.350> day<00:01:04.379> which<00:01:04.680> is<00:01:04.799> another

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
tend to stay all day which is another

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.410 
tend to stay all day which is another
reason<00:01:05.159> I<00:01:05.549> don't<00:01:05.729> set<00:01:05.939> it<00:01:05.970> with<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.210> powder

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
reason I don't set it with the powder

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.510 
reason I don't set it with the powder
that<00:01:06.990> way<00:01:07.170> in<00:01:07.439> between<00:01:07.530> classes<00:01:07.979> I<00:01:08.220> can<00:01:08.340> kind

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
that way in between classes I can kind

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.670 
that way in between classes I can kind
of<00:01:08.580> come<00:01:08.790> back<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.210> add<00:01:09.360> any<00:01:09.780> foundation<00:01:10.590> to

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
of come back and add any foundation to

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.500 
of come back and add any foundation to
any<00:01:10.710> spots<00:01:11.130> that<00:01:11.250> I<00:01:11.369> have<00:01:11.640> I<00:01:11.670> can<00:01:12.060> also<00:01:12.180> add

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
any spots that I have I can also add

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.719 
any spots that I have I can also add
concealer<00:01:13.320> but<00:01:13.530> I<00:01:13.560> do<00:01:13.710> like<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.159> feeling<00:01:14.670> of

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
concealer but I do like the feeling of

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:15.800 
concealer but I do like the feeling of
the<00:01:14.850> foundation<00:01:15.270> because<00:01:15.360> it's<00:01:15.570> lighter

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
the foundation because it's lighter

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.210 
the foundation because it's lighter
weight<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.200> concealer<00:01:16.680> you<00:01:16.950> can<00:01:17.070> tell
