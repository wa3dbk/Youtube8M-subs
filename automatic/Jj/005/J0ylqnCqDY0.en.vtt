00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:25.710 
your legs straight and touch your toes
and<00:04:22.260> also<00:04:23.580> if<00:04:24.580> you<00:04:24.729> cross<00:04:25.030> one<00:04:25.300> of<00:04:25.389> your<00:04:25.539> legs

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
over when you do this and it stretches

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.120 
over when you do this and it stretches
just<00:04:27.910> one<00:04:28.090> leg<00:04:28.360> more<00:04:28.930> and<00:04:29.199> then<00:04:29.710> you<00:04:29.800> cross<00:04:29.979> the

just one leg more and then you cross the

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.670 
just one leg more and then you cross the
other<00:04:30.250> one<00:04:30.400> over<00:04:30.520> and<00:04:30.820> do<00:04:30.940> the<00:04:31.060> same<00:04:31.240> thing<00:04:31.680> you

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
other one over and do the same thing you

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.150 
other one over and do the same thing you
can<00:04:32.889> also<00:04:33.039> do<00:04:33.490> half<00:04:34.150> splits<00:04:34.630> which<00:04:35.380> is<00:04:35.650> it's<00:04:36.010> a

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
can also do half splits which is it's a

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.850 
can also do half splits which is it's a
very<00:04:36.370> similar<00:04:36.610> position<00:04:37.120> to<00:04:37.240> a<00:04:37.270> lunge<00:04:37.860> except

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
very similar position to a lunge except

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.830 
very similar position to a lunge except
on<00:04:39.100> the<00:04:39.250> lunge<00:04:39.490> your<00:04:39.910> back<00:04:40.150> leg<00:04:40.449> the<00:04:40.810> other

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
on the lunge your back leg the other

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.659 
on the lunge your back leg the other
thing<00:04:41.169> that's<00:04:41.289> touching<00:04:41.530> the<00:04:41.770> floor<00:04:41.919> is<00:04:42.220> the

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669 
thing that's touching the floor is the

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:45.420 
thing that's touching the floor is the
fit<00:04:43.030> but<00:04:43.900> on<00:04:44.110> the<00:04:44.289> half<00:04:44.440> let<00:04:44.830> you<00:04:45.010> put<00:04:45.280> your

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
fit but on the half let you put your

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.400 
fit but on the half let you put your
knee<00:04:45.789> and<00:04:46.060> your<00:04:46.120> leg<00:04:46.479> on<00:04:46.720> the<00:04:46.780> ground<00:04:47.050> as<00:04:47.199> well

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
knee and your leg on the ground as well

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.040 
knee and your leg on the ground as well
so<00:04:48.370> it's<00:04:48.520> like<00:04:48.970> you're<00:04:49.180> doing<00:04:49.360> the<00:04:49.449> splits<00:04:49.690> but

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
so it's like you're doing the splits but

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:55.350 
so it's like you're doing the splits but
your<00:04:50.169> front<00:04:50.380> leg<00:04:50.470> is<00:04:50.590> bent<00:04:50.800> and<00:04:53.370> then<00:04:54.370> after

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
your front leg is bent and then after

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.770 
your front leg is bent and then after
you've<00:04:55.449> done<00:04:55.570> this<00:04:55.810> it<00:04:56.680> is<00:04:57.310> time<00:04:58.120> to<00:04:58.150> go<00:04:58.479> for

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
you've done this it is time to go for

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.480 
you've done this it is time to go for
the<00:04:58.810> splits<00:04:59.550> so<00:05:00.550> for<00:05:01.210> the<00:05:01.300> splits<00:05:02.100> this<00:05:03.100> is

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
the splits so for the splits this is

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.610 
the splits so for the splits this is
what<00:05:03.940> I<00:05:03.970> did<00:05:04.270> every<00:05:04.750> day<00:05:04.900> to<00:05:04.960> learn<00:05:05.199> the<00:05:05.320> splits

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
what I did every day to learn the splits

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.670 
what I did every day to learn the splits
I<00:05:05.889> would<00:05:06.850> do<00:05:07.090> these<00:05:07.300> stretches<00:05:07.600> and<00:05:08.169> then<00:05:08.380> go

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
I would do these stretches and then go

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.010 
I would do these stretches and then go
into<00:05:08.949> half<00:05:09.610> split<00:05:10.030> with<00:05:10.419> my<00:05:10.449> left<00:05:10.750> leg<00:05:10.870> in

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
into half split with my left leg in

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.650 
into half split with my left leg in
front<00:05:11.110> and<00:05:11.349> my<00:05:11.440> right<00:05:11.590> leg<00:05:11.710> behind<00:05:12.630> from<00:05:13.630> the

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:13.660 
front and my right leg behind from the

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:19.529 
front and my right leg behind from the
hospitai<00:05:15.180> straighten<00:05:16.180> my<00:05:16.750> front<00:05:17.440> leg<00:05:18.270> as<00:05:19.270> far

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:19.539 
hospitai straighten my front leg as far

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:22.860 
hospitai straighten my front leg as far
down<00:05:19.570> as<00:05:19.750> I<00:05:19.990> could<00:05:20.169> go<00:05:20.320> and<00:05:21.479> when<00:05:22.479> I<00:05:22.510> was<00:05:22.720> this

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
down as I could go and when I was this

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.469 
down as I could go and when I was this
far<00:05:22.930> I<00:05:23.440> would<00:05:23.949> hold<00:05:24.130> this<00:05:24.310> position<00:05:24.550> for<00:05:24.880> eight

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:25.479 
far I would hold this position for eight

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:29.730 
far I would hold this position for eight
seconds<00:05:26.070> then<00:05:27.070> I<00:05:27.370> word<00:05:27.760> and<00:05:28.470> take<00:05:29.470> a<00:05:29.500> deep

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740 
seconds then I word and take a deep

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.730 
seconds then I word and take a deep
breath<00:05:29.940> then<00:05:30.940> as<00:05:31.180> I<00:05:31.330> exhales<00:05:31.780> I<00:05:32.050> would<00:05:32.530> lower

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:32.740 
breath then as I exhales I would lower

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.400 
breath then as I exhales I would lower
myself<00:05:32.979> down<00:05:33.220> just<00:05:33.910> a<00:05:34.090> bit<00:05:34.120> more<00:05:34.419> and<00:05:34.690> out<00:05:35.229> of

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:35.410 
myself down just a bit more and out of

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:37.469 
myself down just a bit more and out of
my<00:05:35.530> comfort<00:05:35.680> zone<00:05:35.919> I<00:05:36.340> would<00:05:36.940> hold<00:05:37.090> that<00:05:37.300> for

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:37.479 
my comfort zone I would hold that for

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:40.610 
my comfort zone I would hold that for
eight<00:05:37.570> seconds<00:05:38.020> and<00:05:38.289> then<00:05:39.010> I<00:05:39.400> would<00:05:39.849> stand<00:05:40.150> up

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
eight seconds and then I would stand up

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:49.020 
eight seconds and then I would stand up
and<00:05:42.000> ah<00:05:43.800> I<00:05:44.800> would<00:05:45.220> then<00:05:45.370> rest<00:05:45.789> for<00:05:46.289> about<00:05:48.030> 30

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.030 
and ah I would then rest for about 30

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.510 
and ah I would then rest for about 30
seconds<00:05:49.510> and<00:05:49.800> I<00:05:50.800> would<00:05:51.010> repeat<00:05:51.280> the<00:05:51.370> whole

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 
seconds and I would repeat the whole

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:57.050 
seconds and I would repeat the whole
thing<00:05:51.699> again<00:05:51.849> and<00:05:53.400> this<00:05:54.400> time<00:05:54.460> I<00:05:55.180> would<00:05:55.500> do<00:05:56.500> the

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.060 
thing again and this time I would do the

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.520 
thing again and this time I would do the
both<00:05:58.060> of<00:05:58.270> the<00:05:58.360> stretch<00:05:58.570> said<00:05:58.810> done<00:05:58.960> before<00:05:59.289> but

00:05:59.520 --> 00:05:59.530 
both of the stretch said done before but

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:01.020 
both of the stretch said done before but
then<00:05:59.680> I'm<00:05:59.770> take<00:05:59.949> another<00:06:00.190> deep<00:06:00.370> breath<00:06:00.430> and<00:06:00.820> go

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.030 
then I'm take another deep breath and go

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:06.240 
then I'm take another deep breath and go
a<00:06:01.060> slightly<00:06:01.330> lower<00:06:02.310> so<00:06:03.310> then<00:06:03.490> um<00:06:05.130> then<00:06:06.130> I'll

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:06.250 
a slightly lower so then um then I'll

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:09.570 
a slightly lower so then um then I'll
stand<00:06:06.490> up<00:06:06.610> again<00:06:06.909> and<00:06:07.889> take<00:06:08.889> a<00:06:08.949> rest<00:06:09.190> for<00:06:09.370> 30

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:09.580 
stand up again and take a rest for 30

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.060 
stand up again and take a rest for 30
seconds<00:06:10.000> and<00:06:10.240> then<00:06:10.930> I<00:06:11.020> would<00:06:11.199> just<00:06:11.500> go<00:06:11.830> down

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:12.070 
seconds and then I would just go down

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:14.100 
seconds and then I would just go down
once<00:06:12.370> and<00:06:12.669> see<00:06:12.880> how<00:06:13.030> like<00:06:13.240> I<00:06:13.270> get<00:06:13.599> hold<00:06:13.960> that

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:14.110 
once and see how like I get hold that

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:15.880 
once and see how like I get hold that
for<00:06:14.289> eight<00:06:14.349> seconds

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:15.890 
for eight seconds

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:19.490 
for eight seconds
so<00:06:16.910> if<00:06:17.910> you<00:06:18.060> keep<00:06:18.270> on<00:06:18.390> doing<00:06:18.630> that<00:06:18.780> and<00:06:19.320> you

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:19.500 
so if you keep on doing that and you

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.920 
so if you keep on doing that and you
keep<00:06:19.650> on<00:06:19.830> stretching<00:06:20.040> then<00:06:20.820> you<00:06:21.630> should<00:06:21.840> be

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:21.930 
keep on stretching then you should be

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:23.990 
keep on stretching then you should be
getting<00:06:22.050> lower<00:06:22.380> and<00:06:22.500> lower<00:06:22.650> until<00:06:23.070> you<00:06:23.820> reach

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.000 
getting lower and lower until you reach

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.900 
getting lower and lower until you reach
the<00:06:24.030> splits<00:06:24.510> it<00:06:25.260> takes<00:06:25.560> time<00:06:25.860> and<00:06:26.160> so<00:06:26.790> many

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:26.910 
the splits it takes time and so many

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:29.660 
the splits it takes time and so many
people<00:06:27.150> start<00:06:27.960> off<00:06:28.170> stretching<00:06:28.860> this<00:06:29.070> bit<00:06:29.340> and

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:29.670 
people start off stretching this bit and

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:32.150 
people start off stretching this bit and
then<00:06:30.030> it<00:06:30.780> takes<00:06:31.020> so<00:06:31.230> much<00:06:31.350> time<00:06:31.410> that<00:06:31.980> they
