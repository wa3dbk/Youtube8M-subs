00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
you can slide the lens in so it fits

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.009 
you can slide the lens in so it fits
over<00:02:44.410> one<00:02:44.920> of<00:02:45.040> these<00:02:45.160> focusing<00:02:45.849> icons<00:02:46.239> so<00:02:46.959> you

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
over one of these focusing icons so you

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:49.080 
over one of these focusing icons so you
can<00:02:47.170> see<00:02:47.290> what<00:02:47.440> you're<00:02:47.560> focusing<00:02:48.130> and<00:02:48.790> as<00:02:48.970> you

can see what you're focusing and as you

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.629 
can see what you're focusing and as you
can<00:02:49.209> see<00:02:49.389> it<00:02:49.480> just<00:02:49.630> just<00:02:49.859> straight<00:02:50.859> on<00:02:51.069> you<00:02:51.489> can

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:51.639 
can see it just just straight on you can

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:55.379 
can see it just just straight on you can
take<00:02:51.790> it<00:02:51.910> on<00:02:52.090> and<00:02:52.239> off<00:02:52.380> no<00:02:53.380> harm<00:02:53.680> done<00:02:53.980> it<00:02:54.910> just

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:55.389 
take it on and off no harm done it just

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:58.259 
take it on and off no harm done it just
it<00:02:55.900> goes<00:02:55.930> over<00:02:56.349> the<00:02:56.560> original<00:02:56.919> lens<00:02:57.370> barrel

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
it goes over the original lens barrel

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:02.069 
it goes over the original lens barrel
which<00:02:58.690> is<00:02:58.720> just<00:02:59.380> a<00:02:59.590> great<00:02:59.769> idea<00:03:00.099> and<00:03:01.079> it's

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:02.079 
which is just a great idea and it's

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:03.900 
which is just a great idea and it's
generally<00:03:02.650> doesn't<00:03:03.069> look<00:03:03.220> that<00:03:03.250> bad

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
generally doesn't look that bad

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.240 
generally doesn't look that bad
as<00:03:04.569> you<00:03:04.900> can<00:03:05.049> see<00:03:05.200> it<00:03:05.470> spends<00:03:06.329> about<00:03:07.329> an<00:03:07.599> inch

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
as you can see it spends about an inch

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.180 
as you can see it spends about an inch
over<00:03:09.250> the<00:03:09.790> original<00:03:10.030> holder<00:03:10.620> but<00:03:11.620> I<00:03:11.889> don't

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
over the original holder but I don't

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.240 
over the original holder but I don't
think<00:03:12.489> it<00:03:12.639> makes<00:03:12.819> any<00:03:13.000> difference<00:03:13.269> and

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
think it makes any difference and

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:15.920 
think it makes any difference and
if<00:03:14.400> anything<00:03:14.910> I<00:03:15.030> think<00:03:15.090> it<00:03:15.360> makes<00:03:15.510> it<00:03:15.720> look

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
if anything I think it makes it look

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:22.030 
if anything I think it makes it look
better<00:03:16.970> so<00:03:17.970> I<00:03:18.330> think<00:03:19.260> the<00:03:20.070> lens<00:03:20.280> was<00:03:20.460> about<00:03:20.730> 24

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
better so I think the lens was about 24

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:28.660 
better so I think the lens was about 24
$99<00:03:23.040> USD<00:03:23.880> which<00:03:24.690> is<00:03:24.990> about<00:03:25.290> 16<00:03:25.800> pounds<00:03:26.900> g/b

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
pounds so that is it's not cheap but
