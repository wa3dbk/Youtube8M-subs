00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.690 
and for me that's a five millimeter
stitch<00:01:39.479> so<00:01:40.049> that<00:01:40.170> means<00:01:40.380> it's<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.680> long<00:01:40.920> stitch

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
stitch so that means it's a long stitch

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.219 
stitch so that means it's a long stitch
dotted<00:01:42.060> line<00:01:42.180> not<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.420> really<00:01:42.659> close<00:01:42.869> little

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
dotted line not a really close little

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:52.850 
dotted line not a really close little
dotted<00:01:43.890> line<00:01:44.299> so<00:01:45.299> now<00:01:45.450> all<00:01:45.799> you<00:01:46.799> do<00:01:51.680> she<00:01:52.680> are

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
dotted line so now all you do she are

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.359 
dotted line so now all you do she are
going<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:54.619> blend<00:01:55.619> that<00:01:55.770> up<00:01:55.860> with<00:01:55.979> your<00:01:56.070> machine

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
going to blend that up with your machine

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.340 
going to blend that up with your machine
and<00:01:56.549> do<00:01:57.030> it<00:01:57.149> slow<00:01:57.479> because<00:01:57.780> you're<00:01:58.049> going<00:01:58.229> on<00:01:58.320> a

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
and do it slow because you're going on a

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.990 
and do it slow because you're going on a
curve<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:58.860> if<00:01:59.130> you<00:01:59.189> go<00:01:59.310> too<00:01:59.460> fast<00:01:59.610> you<00:01:59.909> won't

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
curve and if you go too fast you won't

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.490 
curve and if you go too fast you won't
be<00:02:00.149> able<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.360> control<00:02:00.600> it<00:02:00.750> as<00:02:00.869> well<00:02:01.020> around<00:02:01.409> the

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
be able to control it as well around the

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.459 
be able to control it as well around the
curve<00:02:02.810> so<00:02:03.810> you're<00:02:03.930> just<00:02:04.020> going<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.320> very

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
curve so you're just going to very

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.520 
curve so you're just going to very
slowly<00:02:05.299> or<00:02:06.299> as<00:02:06.479> you<00:02:06.810> know<00:02:06.899> fast<00:02:07.229> as<00:02:07.409> you're

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
slowly or as you know fast as you're

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.820 
slowly or as you know fast as you're
comfortable<00:02:07.740> go<00:02:08.160> around<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.899> edge<00:02:10.229> of<00:02:10.560> your

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
comfortable go around the edge of your

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.500 
comfortable go around the edge of your
scene<00:02:11.069> here

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
scene here

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:21.110 
scene here
just<00:02:13.500> guide<00:02:13.680> it<00:02:16.489> around<00:02:17.489> the<00:02:17.760> curve<00:02:20.030> and<00:02:21.030> you

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
just guide it around the curve and you

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.589 
just guide it around the curve and you
just<00:02:21.269> do<00:02:21.450> this<00:02:21.659> all<00:02:21.989> the<00:02:22.049> way<00:02:22.230> around<00:02:23.599> the

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
just do this all the way around the

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:30.500 
just do this all the way around the
neckline<00:02:28.670> I'm<00:02:29.670> gonna<00:02:29.790> speed<00:02:29.970> it<00:02:30.000> up<00:02:30.120> a<00:02:30.180> tiny

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
neckline I'm gonna speed it up a tiny

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.369 
neckline I'm gonna speed it up a tiny
tiny<00:02:30.870> bit<00:02:30.989> because<00:02:31.340> too<00:02:32.340> slow<00:02:33.230> can<00:02:34.230> be<00:02:34.349> a

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379 
tiny bit because too slow can be a

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:37.280 
tiny bit because too slow can be a
little<00:02:34.560> irritated<00:02:35.810> she<00:02:36.810> just<00:02:36.900> going<00:02:37.019> to<00:02:37.110> guide

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
little irritated she just going to guide

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.839 
little irritated she just going to guide
all<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:37.860> way<00:02:37.950> around<00:02:38.069> take<00:02:38.430> it<00:02:38.549> to<00:02:38.609> the<00:02:38.730> end

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
all the way around take it to the end

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:48.470 
all the way around take it to the end
and<00:02:46.340> then<00:02:47.340> when<00:02:47.459> you<00:02:47.519> get<00:02:47.609> to<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:47.819> end<00:02:47.909> you<00:02:48.120> are

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
and then when you get to the end you are

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.080 
and then when you get to the end you are
going<00:02:48.989> to<00:02:49.200> do<00:02:49.680> a<00:02:49.709> back<00:02:50.069> stitch<00:02:50.310> and<00:02:50.670> that's

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
going to do a back stitch and that's

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.250 
going to do a back stitch and that's
basically<00:02:51.269> where<00:02:51.569> you<00:02:51.690> just<00:02:51.840> reverse<00:02:52.049> and

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
basically where you just reverse and

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.949 
basically where you just reverse and
stitch<00:02:52.440> once<00:02:53.250> or<00:02:53.400> twice<00:02:53.519> and<00:02:53.940> it<00:02:54.599> really<00:02:54.780> just

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
stitch once or twice and it really just

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.589 
stitch once or twice and it really just
secures<00:02:55.290> it<00:02:55.440> in<00:02:55.500> there<00:02:55.620> and<00:02:55.709> kind<00:02:55.799> of<00:02:55.920> knots<00:02:56.069> it

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:03.399 

because<00:03:00.599> stay<00:03:00.840> stitching<00:03:01.260> stays<00:03:01.590> in<00:03:01.799> forever

00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:03.409 
because stay stitching stays in forever

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:05.059 
because stay stitching stays in forever
then<00:03:04.409> you're<00:03:04.500> just<00:03:04.530> going<00:03:04.709> to<00:03:04.799> click<00:03:04.950> the

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
then you're just going to click the

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:17.780 
then you're just going to click the
thread<00:03:08.690> and<00:03:10.790> that<00:03:11.790> is<00:03:12.120> a<00:03:12.150> stay<00:03:12.420> stitch<00:03:16.790> so

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
thread and that is a stay stitch so

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.400 
thread and that is a stay stitch so
ignore<00:03:18.150> the<00:03:18.269> shoddy<00:03:18.480> job<00:03:18.720> but<00:03:18.989> this<00:03:19.079> is<00:03:19.230> um

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
ignore the shoddy job but this is um

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.140 
ignore the shoddy job but this is um
yeah<00:03:20.280> this<00:03:20.430> will<00:03:20.519> just<00:03:20.669> kind<00:03:20.760> of<00:03:20.849> keep<00:03:21.000> your

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
yeah this will just kind of keep your

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.460 
yeah this will just kind of keep your
fabric<00:03:21.480> from<00:03:21.599> stretching<00:03:21.840> and<00:03:22.079> wearing<00:03:22.290> over

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
fabric from stretching and wearing over

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.379 
fabric from stretching and wearing over
time<00:03:22.650> on<00:03:22.889> the<00:03:23.010> curve<00:03:23.190> or<00:03:23.340> the<00:03:23.370> neckline<00:03:23.730> so<00:03:24.299> you

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:24.389 
time on the curve or the neckline so you

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:27.949 
time on the curve or the neckline so you
don't<00:03:24.540> get<00:03:24.629> any<00:03:24.810> stretching<00:03:25.109> or<00:03:26.660> pulling<00:03:27.660> of

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
don't get any stretching or pulling of

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.920 
don't get any stretching or pulling of
the<00:03:27.989> fabric<00:03:28.410> so<00:03:29.220> yeah<00:03:29.699> that's<00:03:30.540> pretty<00:03:30.810> much

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
the fabric so yeah that's pretty much

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.730 
the fabric so yeah that's pretty much
what<00:03:31.169> those<00:03:31.549> carry<00:03:32.549> on
