00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
technical issues and the fact that they

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:14.930 
technical issues and the fact that they
just<00:00:13.980> didn't<00:00:14.219> look<00:00:14.280> like<00:00:14.460> most<00:00:14.639> the<00:00:14.820> other

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
would like to have another game it still

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.690 
would like to have another game it still
looks<00:00:36.870> for<00:00:37.770> lack<00:00:37.890> of<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:38.070> better<00:00:38.190> term<00:00:38.309> like<00:00:38.550> a

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
looks for lack of a better term like a

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.049 
looks for lack of a better term like a
double-a<00:00:39.420> game<00:00:40.079> there's<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.710> lot<00:00:40.860> of

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
double-a game there's a lot of

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:44.090 
double-a game there's a lot of
waterfalls<00:00:42.059> going<00:00:42.780> straight<00:00:43.230> into<00:00:43.440> rocks<00:00:43.800> and

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
waterfalls going straight into rocks and

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.709 
waterfalls going straight into rocks and
just<00:00:44.250> sort<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.700> disappearing<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.420> lot<00:00:45.600> of

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
just sort of disappearing a lot of

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.779 
just sort of disappearing a lot of
jagged<00:00:46.379> edges<00:00:46.500> on<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.010> on<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.399> trees<00:00:47.610> and

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
jagged edges on the on the trees and

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.549 
jagged edges on the on the trees and
branches<00:00:47.879> but<00:00:48.300> I<00:00:48.510> mean<00:00:48.750> if<00:00:48.989> that<00:00:49.320> kind<00:00:49.530> of

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
branches but I mean if that kind of

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:50.630 
branches but I mean if that kind of
stuff<00:00:49.739> bothers<00:00:50.070> you<00:00:50.129> in<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.309> first<00:00:50.520> a

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
stuff bothers you in the first a

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.799 
stuff bothers you in the first a
Thailand<00:00:51.030> you're<00:00:51.180> probably<00:00:51.270> gonna<00:00:51.570> pick<00:00:51.719> up

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
Thailand you're probably gonna pick up

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.569 
Thailand you're probably gonna pick up
Riptide<00:00:52.140> anyway<00:00:52.500> it<00:00:52.980> seems<00:00:53.280> like<00:00:53.430> they<00:00:53.550> are

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
Riptide anyway it seems like they are

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.819 
Riptide anyway it seems like they are
focusing<00:00:54.120> more<00:00:54.180> on<00:00:54.629> making<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.320> cooperative

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
focusing more on making the cooperative

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.590 
focusing more on making the cooperative
gameplay<00:00:56.070> better<00:00:56.520> which<00:00:57.149> is<00:00:57.270> good<00:00:57.420> because

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
gameplay better which is good because

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.450 
gameplay better which is good because
that<00:00:57.719> was<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:57.989> original<00:00:58.109> dead<00:00:58.410> islands<00:00:58.739> best

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
that was the original dead islands best

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.400 
that was the original dead islands best
strength<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.300> full<00:01:00.660> operative<00:01:00.989> gameplay<00:01:01.260> was

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
strength the full operative gameplay was

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.840 
strength the full operative gameplay was
pretty<00:01:01.590> much<00:01:01.739> seamless<00:01:02.190> somebody<00:01:02.609> actually

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
pretty much seamless somebody actually

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:03.889 
pretty much seamless somebody actually
jumped<00:01:03.059> into<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.300> game<00:01:03.329> without<00:01:03.510> me<00:01:03.660> even

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
jumped into the game without me even

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.870 
jumped into the game without me even
realizing<00:01:04.049> it<00:01:04.710> which<00:01:05.129> may<00:01:05.280> be<00:01:05.339> a<00:01:05.430> good<00:01:05.670> or<00:01:05.760> bad

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
realizing it which may be a good or bad

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:06.380 
realizing it which may be a good or bad
thing

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
thing

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.730 
thing
and<00:01:06.780> they<00:01:06.960> have<00:01:07.170> leaned<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.380> little<00:01:07.470> bit

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
and they have leaned a little bit

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.010 
and they have leaned a little bit
heavier<00:01:08.010> on<00:01:08.250> teamwork<00:01:08.580> mechanics<00:01:09.240> like<00:01:09.450> being

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
heavier on teamwork mechanics like being

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.539 
heavier on teamwork mechanics like being
able<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.229> paint<00:01:10.470> objectives<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.189> then<00:01:11.280> having

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
able to paint objectives and then having

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.670 
able to paint objectives and then having
people<00:01:11.580> run<00:01:11.970> over<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.299> them<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:13.020> game<00:01:13.229> is<00:01:13.409> made

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
people run over to them the game is made

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.469 
people run over to them the game is made
so<00:01:14.010> you<00:01:14.100> can<00:01:14.159> even<00:01:14.430> play<00:01:14.640> with<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.850> stranger

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
so you can even play with the stranger

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.149 
so you can even play with the stranger
because<00:01:16.140> when<00:01:16.259> someone<00:01:16.530> joins<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.860> game<00:01:17.009> it

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
because when someone joins the game it

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:17.960 
because when someone joins the game it
wants<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.430> do<00:01:17.520> something<00:01:17.850> completely

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
wants to do something completely

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.609 
wants to do something completely
different<00:01:18.570> then<00:01:19.110> he<00:01:19.229> does<00:01:19.409> something

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
different then he does something

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.320 
different then he does something
completely<00:01:19.799> different<00:01:20.430> but<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:21.030> gain<00:01:21.180> XP

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
completely different but you gain XP

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.870 
completely different but you gain XP
from<00:01:21.689> it<00:01:21.869> but<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.890> lot<00:01:23.100> of<00:01:23.159> people<00:01:23.400> don't<00:01:23.729> want

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
from it but a lot of people don't want

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.580 
from it but a lot of people don't want
to<00:01:23.939> talk<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.270> strangers<00:01:24.689> so<00:01:25.170> we<00:01:25.320> wanted<00:01:25.500> to

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
to talk to strangers so we wanted to

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.960 
to talk to strangers so we wanted to
have<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:25.890> feature<00:01:26.159> in<00:01:26.369> there<00:01:26.520> that<00:01:26.670> people

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
have a feature in there that people

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.850 
have a feature in there that people
could<00:01:27.119> actually<00:01:27.240> point<00:01:28.020> in<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.259> directions

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
could actually point in a directions

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.130 
could actually point in a directions
