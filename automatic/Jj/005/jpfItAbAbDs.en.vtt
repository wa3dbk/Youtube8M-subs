00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
which slowed him down tremendously and I

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.790 
which slowed him down tremendously and I
think<00:01:46.180> that<00:01:46.420> kept<00:01:46.720> him<00:01:46.840> from<00:01:46.990> flying<00:01:47.380> it<00:01:47.620> to

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800
