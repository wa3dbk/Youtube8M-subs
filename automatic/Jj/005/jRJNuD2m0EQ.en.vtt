00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
these little wheels that really weren't

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.450 
these little wheels that really weren't
made<00:00:14.309> to<00:00:14.519> roll<00:00:14.670> in<00:00:14.790> sand<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:15.269> then<00:00:16.080> our<00:00:16.800> 12<00:00:17.160> by

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
made to roll in sand and then our 12 by

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.840 
made to roll in sand and then our 12 by
14<00:00:18.170> canopy<00:00:19.170> shade<00:00:19.410> canopy<00:00:19.680> and<00:00:20.340> this<00:00:20.609> thing

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
14 canopy shade canopy and this thing

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.590 
14 canopy shade canopy and this thing
weighs<00:00:21.410> 64<00:00:22.410> pounds<00:00:22.619> by<00:00:23.010> itself<00:00:23.240> so<00:00:24.240> I<00:00:24.269> wanted

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
weighs 64 pounds by itself so I wanted

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.660 
weighs 64 pounds by itself so I wanted
to<00:00:24.720> come<00:00:24.900> up<00:00:25.019> with<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.170> way<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.350> get<00:00:25.650> those<00:00:25.859> to

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
to come up with a way to get those to

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.370 
to come up with a way to get those to
the<00:00:26.789> beach<00:00:26.939> easily<00:00:27.359> enough<00:00:27.630> and<00:00:27.840> so<00:00:28.349> I

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
the beach easily enough and so I

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.679 
the beach easily enough and so I
designed<00:00:28.849> and<00:00:29.849> built<00:00:30.060> my<00:00:30.240> beach<00:00:30.390> cart

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
designed and built my beach cart

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.850 
designed and built my beach cart
yesterday<00:00:31.279> and<00:00:32.279> so<00:00:32.520> I<00:00:32.550> designed<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.329> length

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:33.860 
yesterday and so I designed the length

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.639 
yesterday and so I designed the length
to<00:00:34.910> facilitate<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.570> canopy<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.140> then<00:00:37.559> I

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
to facilitate the the canopy and then I

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.840 
to facilitate the the canopy and then I
designed<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.190> width<00:00:38.430> around<00:00:40.309> the<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.760> ice

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
designed the width around the the ice

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.350 
designed the width around the the ice
chest<00:00:42.210> but<00:00:42.690> then<00:00:42.809> also<00:00:43.309> these<00:00:44.309> power<00:00:44.940> of<00:00:45.239> these

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
chest but then also these power of these

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.690 
chest but then also these power of these
wheels<00:00:45.600> I<00:00:45.809> took<00:00:46.020> off<00:00:46.170> of<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.530> kid's<00:00:46.800> electric

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
wheels I took off of a kid's electric

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.880 
wheels I took off of a kid's electric
scooter<00:00:48.090> like<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.360> Power<00:00:48.570> Wheels<00:00:48.840> so<00:00:49.680> that's

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
scooter like the Power Wheels so that's

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.090 
scooter like the Power Wheels so that's
the<00:00:50.239> actual<00:00:51.239> axle<00:00:52.050> didn't<00:00:52.379> even<00:00:52.469> cut<00:00:52.890> it<00:00:52.920> or

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
the actual axle didn't even cut it or

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.889 
the actual axle didn't even cut it or
anything<00:00:53.309> just<00:00:53.640> use<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.000> exact<00:00:54.300> axle<00:00:54.719> there

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
anything just use the exact axle there

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.090 
anything just use the exact axle there
and<00:00:55.460> built<00:00:56.460> this<00:00:56.579> thing<00:00:56.789> so<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.090> way<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.329> works

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
and built this thing so the way it works

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.849 
and built this thing so the way it works
is<00:00:59.300> standing<00:01:00.300> up

00:01:02.849 --> 00:01:02.859 

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:07.600 

like<00:01:03.859> this<00:01:04.210> other<00:01:05.210> thing<00:01:05.420> is<00:01:06.009> for<00:01:07.009> these

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
like this other thing is for these

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.020 
like this other thing is for these
particular<00:01:08.000> pieces<00:01:08.360> here<00:01:08.869> I<00:01:09.400> use<00:01:10.400> slip<00:01:10.759> tees

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
particular pieces here I use slip tees

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.760 
particular pieces here I use slip tees
and<00:01:11.330> the<00:01:11.570> reason<00:01:11.810> I<00:01:11.869> use<00:01:11.900> slip<00:01:12.290> tees<00:01:12.560> is

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
and the reason I use slip tees is

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.370 
and the reason I use slip tees is
because<00:01:13.130> these<00:01:13.759> are<00:01:13.940> these<00:01:14.090> long<00:01:14.390> pieces<00:01:15.110> of

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
because these are these long pieces of

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.859 
because these are these long pieces of
pipe<00:01:15.590> or<00:01:16.030> single<00:01:17.030> piece<00:01:17.180> of<00:01:17.360> pipe<00:01:17.509> there's<00:01:17.750> no

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
pipe or single piece of pipe there's no

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:19.210 
pipe or single piece of pipe there's no
joint<00:01:18.200> and<00:01:18.409> I<00:01:18.440> did<00:01:18.619> that<00:01:18.770> for<00:01:18.890> strength

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
joint and I did that for strength

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.410 
joint and I did that for strength
because<00:01:19.520> it<00:01:19.549> has<00:01:19.729> to<00:01:19.850> bear<00:01:20.030> a<00:01:20.060> pretty<00:01:20.270> good

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
because it has to bear a pretty good

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.180 
because it has to bear a pretty good
amount<00:01:20.600> of<00:01:20.690> weight<00:01:20.750> with<00:01:21.590> the<00:01:21.740> weight<00:01:21.890> of<00:01:21.920> the

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 
amount of weight with the weight of the

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.690 
amount of weight with the weight of the
of<00:01:23.119> the<00:01:23.270> canopy<00:01:23.570> so<00:01:24.350> the<00:01:24.440> way<00:01:24.560> it<00:01:24.680> works<00:01:24.710> is<00:01:25.580> you

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
of the canopy so the way it works is you

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.060 
of the canopy so the way it works is you
just<00:01:26.440> stand<00:01:27.440> it<00:01:27.530> up<00:01:27.619> like<00:01:27.680> that

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.350 

set<00:01:31.730> the

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.240 

canapé<00:01:35.360> down<00:01:35.510> inside<00:01:35.870> another<00:01:36.650> good<00:01:36.890> benefit

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
canapé down inside another good benefit

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.320 
canapé down inside another good benefit
of<00:01:37.340> these<00:01:37.430> slim<00:01:37.670> tees<00:01:38.200> then<00:01:39.200> you<00:01:39.290> can<00:01:39.440> slide

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
of these slim tees then you can slide

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.160 
of these slim tees then you can slide
this<00:01:41.330> cradle<00:01:43.060> back<00:01:44.060> down<00:01:44.300> to<00:01:44.510> hold<00:01:44.690> the<00:01:44.750> canopy

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
this cradle back down to hold the canopy

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:51.940 
this cradle back down to hold the canopy
you<00:01:46.060> can<00:01:47.060> just<00:01:48.280> let<00:01:49.280> it<00:01:49.310> down<00:01:50.740> slide<00:01:51.740> this<00:01:51.920> a

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
you can just let it down slide this a

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.690 
you can just let it down slide this a
little<00:01:52.190> more<00:01:52.400> forward<00:01:52.700> and<00:01:53.950> to<00:01:54.950> them<00:01:55.130> to

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
little more forward and to them to

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.740 
little more forward and to them to
demonstrate<00:01:55.910> wait<00:01:56.770> I'm<00:01:57.770> going<00:01:57.920> to<00:01:57.979> take<00:01:58.130> my<00:01:58.750> 80

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
demonstrate wait I'm going to take my 80

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.200 
demonstrate wait I'm going to take my 80
to<00:01:59.900> 80<00:01:59.990> toolbox<00:02:00.440> which<00:02:00.979> I<00:02:01.130> just<00:02:01.340> weighed<00:02:01.580> it

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
to 80 toolbox which I just weighed it

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.830 
to 80 toolbox which I just weighed it
weighs<00:02:02.360> 40<00:02:02.840> pounds<00:02:04.150> throw<00:02:05.150> to<00:02:05.270> the<00:02:05.360> ice<00:02:05.479> chest

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.990 

so<00:02:08.840> that<00:02:09.080> represents<00:02:09.619> a<00:02:10.220> couple<00:02:10.489> bags<00:02:10.640> of<00:02:10.789> ice

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
so that represents a couple bags of ice

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.840 
so that represents a couple bags of ice
two<00:02:11.630> to<00:02:11.810> ten<00:02:12.020> pound<00:02:12.230> bags<00:02:12.410> of<00:02:12.560> ice<00:02:12.709> and<00:02:13.130> a<00:02:13.670> whole

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
two to ten pound bags of ice and a whole

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:19.089 
two to ten pound bags of ice and a whole
heck<00:02:14.030> of<00:02:14.090> a<00:02:14.180> lot<00:02:14.209> of<00:02:14.330> drinks

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:23.379 

through<00:02:19.640> it<00:02:19.760> there<00:02:21.099> I'm<00:02:22.099> going<00:02:22.310> to<00:02:22.370> cinch<00:02:23.209> this

shovels and all that great stuff and now
one<00:02:38.389> fun<00:02:38.629> design<00:02:38.959> element<00:02:39.290> was<00:02:39.409> that

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
one fun design element was that

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.860 
one fun design element was that
purposely<00:02:39.920> you<00:02:40.430> know<00:02:40.519> I<00:02:40.549> made<00:02:40.760> the<00:02:40.879> top<00:02:41.090> go

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
purposely you know I made the top go

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.170 
purposely you know I made the top go
back<00:02:42.049> farther<00:02:42.379> so<00:02:43.189> that<00:02:43.340> the<00:02:43.430> ice<00:02:43.609> chaps<00:02:43.939> could

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
back farther so that the ice chaps could

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.250 
back farther so that the ice chaps could
be<00:02:44.239> centered<00:02:44.540> over<00:02:44.569> the<00:02:44.719> wheels<00:02:44.959> and<00:02:45.169> what

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
be centered over the wheels and what

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.559 
be centered over the wheels and what
this<00:02:45.439> does<00:02:45.620> is<00:02:45.799> it<00:02:45.950> it<00:02:46.730> keeps<00:02:46.939> as<00:02:47.090> much<00:02:47.299> weight

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
this does is it it keeps as much weight

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:49.270 
this does is it it keeps as much weight
of<00:02:47.840> the<00:02:48.109> ice<00:02:48.230> chest<00:02:48.499> off<00:02:48.709> the<00:02:48.919> front<00:02:49.129> of<00:02:49.189> the

ahead and show how it works it's easy to
move<00:03:08.090> on<00:03:08.269> concrete<00:03:08.689> but<00:03:08.959> let's<00:03:09.109> trot<00:03:09.290> up<00:03:09.469> a

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
move on concrete but let's trot up a

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.099 
move on concrete but let's trot up a
little<00:03:09.709> harder<00:03:09.859> like<00:03:10.099> grass<00:03:10.840> you<00:03:11.840> can<00:03:11.959> also

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:12.109 
little harder like grass you can also

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:18.570 
little harder like grass you can also
easily<00:03:12.799> move<00:03:13.159> it<00:03:13.250> on<00:03:13.370> grass

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.730 

is<00:03:19.090> when<00:03:19.390> you<00:03:19.420> get<00:03:19.630> to<00:03:19.750> the<00:03:19.840> beach<00:03:20.050> it's<00:03:20.440> saying

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:20.740 
is when you get to the beach it's saying

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.370 
is when you get to the beach it's saying
and<00:03:20.980> obviously<00:03:21.340> the<00:03:22.330> wheels<00:03:22.660> are<00:03:22.870> wide<00:03:23.080> but

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
and obviously the wheels are wide but

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
and obviously the wheels are wide but
they're<00:03:23.440> going<00:03:23.560> to<00:03:23.650> have<00:03:23.770> to<00:03:23.860> prevalence<00:03:24.190> and

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
they're going to have to prevalence and

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.750 
they're going to have to prevalence and
so<00:03:24.580> I<00:03:24.640> participated<00:03:25.330> here<00:03:25.720> on<00:03:25.900> base<00:03:26.730> so<00:03:27.730> you

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
so I participated here on base so you

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.100 
so I participated here on base so you
can<00:03:27.880> hold<00:03:28.210> in<00:03:28.810> these<00:03:29.110> two<00:03:29.260> people

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.250 

walk<00:03:32.740> side-by-side

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
walk side-by-side

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.780 
walk side-by-side
so<00:03:34.319> you<00:03:34.379> can<00:03:34.590> have<00:03:34.830> that<00:03:34.950> pulling<00:03:35.340> force<00:03:35.580> that

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
so you can have that pulling force that

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.790 
so you can have that pulling force that
you're<00:03:35.909> going<00:03:36.120> to<00:03:36.150> need<00:03:36.390> to<00:03:37.319> pull<00:03:37.530> it<00:03:37.650> through

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
you're going to need to pull it through

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.020 
you're going to need to pull it through
the<00:03:38.400> sand<00:03:39.019> at<00:03:40.019> the<00:03:40.080> beach<00:03:40.610> so<00:03:41.610> a<00:03:41.640> couple<00:03:41.849> of

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
the sand at the beach so a couple of

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.460 
the sand at the beach so a couple of
final<00:03:42.209> things<00:03:42.450> about<00:03:42.629> the<00:03:42.750> design<00:03:43.049> I<00:03:43.080> went<00:03:43.409> and

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
final things about the design I went and

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.640 
final things about the design I went and
I<00:03:43.530> put<00:03:43.739> just<00:03:43.980> 550<00:03:44.730> cord<00:03:44.909> and<00:03:45.239> I<00:03:45.870> laced<00:03:46.170> the

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
I put just 550 cord and I laced the

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.380 
I put just 550 cord and I laced the
sides<00:03:46.920> as<00:03:47.159> well<00:03:47.340> as<00:03:47.459> the<00:03:47.580> bottom<00:03:47.909> and<00:03:48.090> what

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
sides as well as the bottom and what

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:49.910 
sides as well as the bottom and what

this is it allow you to stand up boogie

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.039 
this is it allow you to stand up boogie
boards<00:03:50.280> or<00:03:50.489> Beach<00:03:51.000> share<00:03:51.299> sideways<00:03:51.750> if<00:03:51.930> you

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
boards or Beach share sideways if you

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:54.140 
boards or Beach share sideways if you
wanted<00:03:52.260> to<00:03:52.410> so<00:03:52.560> they<00:03:52.620> won't<00:03:52.739> fall<00:03:52.950> through<00:03:53.160> and

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
wanted to so they won't fall through and

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.720 
wanted to so they won't fall through and
then<00:03:55.010> you<00:03:56.010> know<00:03:56.099> obviously<00:03:56.340> this<00:03:56.489> thing's
