00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
but I was kind of thinking in the back

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.140 
but I was kind of thinking in the back
of<00:01:12.330> my<00:01:12.420> mind<00:01:12.600> I<00:01:12.810> oh<00:01:12.840> yeah<00:01:13.170> no<00:01:13.350> not<00:01:13.860> really<00:01:14.150> so

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
of my mind I oh yeah no not really so

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.320 
of my mind I oh yeah no not really so
I'm<00:01:15.540> on<00:01:15.720> my<00:01:15.750> ninth<00:01:16.310> life<00:01:17.310> right<00:01:17.640> now<00:01:17.670> so<00:01:18.240> I've

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.780 
will see but now i think i'm on my
thirteenth<00:01:55.700> or<00:01:56.700> so<00:01:56.909> death<00:01:57.210> uh<00:01:58.310> let<00:01:59.310> me<00:01:59.340> yeah

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
thirteenth or so death uh let me yeah

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:06.679 
thirteenth or so death uh let me yeah
13th<00:02:00.689> death<00:02:01.159> so<00:02:02.159> there's<00:02:05.240> that's<00:02:06.240> probably

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
13th death so there's that's probably

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.580 
13th death so there's that's probably
been<00:02:06.840> about<00:02:07.940> 15<00:02:08.940> minutes<00:02:09.179> I'm<00:02:09.539> guessing

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
been about 15 minutes I'm guessing

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.759 
been about 15 minutes I'm guessing
and<00:02:12.269> there's<00:02:13.269> no<00:02:13.780> other<00:02:13.989> lead<00:02:14.260> on<00:02:14.440> the<00:02:14.560> ground

and there's no other lead on the ground

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:16.800 
and there's no other lead on the ground
really<00:02:14.980> there's<00:02:15.250> a<00:02:15.340> couple<00:02:15.640> greens<00:02:16.060> but

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
really there's a couple greens but

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.140 
really there's a couple greens but
that's<00:02:16.989> it<00:02:17.260> and<00:02:17.500> there<00:02:18.430> goes<00:02:18.640> the<00:02:18.940> third

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
that's it and there goes the third

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.259 
that's it and there goes the third
legendary<00:02:20.040> so<00:02:21.040> there<00:02:21.220> there's<00:02:21.849> way<00:02:22.239> more

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
legendary so there there's way more

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:25.940 
legendary so there there's way more
legendaries<00:02:23.140> on<00:02:23.620> the<00:02:23.920> field<00:02:24.190> right<00:02:24.400> now<00:02:24.629> than

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
legendaries on the field right now than

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.559 
legendaries on the field right now than
greens<00:02:26.950> and<00:02:27.370> you<00:02:27.550> know<00:02:27.670> how<00:02:27.910> many<00:02:28.090> greens<00:02:28.390> you

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
greens and you know how many greens you

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:30.630 
greens and you know how many greens you
gave<00:02:28.720> if<00:02:28.959> you<00:02:29.110> ever<00:02:29.260> loot<00:02:29.560> farm<00:02:29.830> you<00:02:30.099> know<00:02:30.129> how

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
gave if you ever loot farm you know how

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.070 
gave if you ever loot farm you know how
many<00:02:30.819> greens<00:02:31.120> you<00:02:31.269> get<00:02:31.450> compared<00:02:31.780> anything

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
many greens you get compared anything

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.850 
many greens you get compared anything
else<00:02:32.340> so<00:02:34.019> this<00:02:35.019> doesn't<00:02:35.260> really<00:02:35.410> say<00:02:35.830> anything

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
else so this doesn't really say anything

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.449 
else so this doesn't really say anything
if<00:02:36.549> you<00:02:36.940> go<00:02:36.970> do<00:02:37.299> this<00:02:37.450> you're<00:02:37.750> not<00:02:37.780> gonna<00:02:38.080> get

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
if you go do this you're not gonna get

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.309 
if you go do this you're not gonna get
three<00:02:39.459> legendaries<00:02:40.060> like<00:02:40.209> I<00:02:40.330> did<00:02:40.510> most<00:02:40.750> likely

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
three legendaries like I did most likely

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.589 
three legendaries like I did most likely
you<00:02:41.739> probably<00:02:42.370> could<00:02:42.580> you're<00:02:43.209> not<00:02:43.299> gonna<00:02:43.390> get

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 
you probably could you're not gonna get

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:45.089 
you probably could you're not gonna get
this<00:02:43.750> many<00:02:43.930> legendaries<00:02:44.380> most<00:02:44.560> likely<00:02:44.920> right

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:45.099 
this many legendaries most likely right

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:48.449 
this many legendaries most likely right
away<00:02:45.340> but<00:02:46.209> you<00:02:46.540> could<00:02:46.780> so<00:02:47.709> then<00:02:47.860> I<00:02:47.920> go<00:02:47.950> back<00:02:48.099> and

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
away but you could so then I go back and

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.069 
away but you could so then I go back and
I<00:02:48.519> ended<00:02:48.700> up<00:02:48.790> getting<00:02:48.940> for<00:02:49.239> legendaries<00:02:49.870> and

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:50.079 
I ended up getting for legendaries and

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:52.130 
I ended up getting for legendaries and
like<00:02:50.260> eight<00:02:50.560> blues<00:02:51.069> in<00:02:51.340> an<00:02:51.459> hour<00:02:51.640> or<00:02:51.790> something

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
like eight blues in an hour or something

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.020 
like eight blues in an hour or something
so<00:02:53.140> my<00:02:53.349> opinion<00:02:53.590> I<00:02:53.920> definitely<00:02:54.340> think<00:02:54.610> this<00:02:54.849> is

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
so my opinion I definitely think this is

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.289 
so my opinion I definitely think this is
the<00:02:55.480> best<00:02:55.750> spot<00:02:56.290> to<00:02:56.500> do<00:02:56.799> it<00:02:56.970> that's<00:02:57.970> what<00:02:58.180> I'm

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
the best spot to do it that's what I'm

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:01.800 
the best spot to do it that's what I'm
gonna<00:02:58.450> go<00:02:58.629> back<00:02:59.160> every<00:03:00.160> day<00:03:00.640> to<00:03:00.670> try<00:03:01.540> and<00:03:01.690> do

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
gonna go back every day to try and do

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.960 
gonna go back every day to try and do
loop<00:03:01.989> farming<00:03:02.410> but<00:03:02.799> you<00:03:03.579> guys<00:03:03.700> definitely

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
loop farming but you guys definitely

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.690 
loop farming but you guys definitely
have<00:03:04.239> to<00:03:04.329> do<00:03:04.450> it<00:03:04.599> I<00:03:04.840> only<00:03:05.049> got<00:03:05.410> one<00:03:06.129> legendary

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
ascendant shards which I needed to level

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.300
