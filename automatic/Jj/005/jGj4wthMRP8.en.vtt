00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.619 
manual says no more than thirty or sixty
seconds<00:00:56.309> but<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:56.520> never<00:00:57.059> use<00:00:57.360> it

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
seconds but I never use it

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.869 
seconds but I never use it
more<00:00:57.989> than<00:00:58.199> five<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.890> ten<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.399> that's<00:00:59.579> all<00:00:59.760> it

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
more than five to ten and that's all it

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.270 
more than five to ten and that's all it
really<00:00:59.910> needs<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.359> get<00:01:00.539> going<00:01:00.899> next<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.010> choke

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
really needs to get going next the choke

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.620 
really needs to get going next the choke
is<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:03.030> gas<00:01:04.729> not<00:01:05.729> really<00:01:05.970> sure<00:01:06.119> what<00:01:06.360> it<00:01:06.479> is

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
is the gas not really sure what it is

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.250 
is the gas not really sure what it is
but<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.110> basically<00:01:08.030> determines<00:01:09.030> which<00:01:09.600> fuel

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
but it basically determines which fuel

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.429 
but it basically determines which fuel
tank<00:01:10.530> you're<00:01:10.680> using<00:01:10.860> down<00:01:11.700> is<00:01:12.090> on<00:01:12.479> regular

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
tank you're using down is on regular

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.499 
tank you're using down is on regular
fuel<00:01:13.770> tank<00:01:14.070> that's<00:01:14.640> what<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:14.909> want<00:01:15.150> at<00:01:15.330> all

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
fuel tank that's what you want at all

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.870 
out you flip this up and to the left and
to<00:01:24.119> put<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.509> into<00:01:24.630> reserve<00:01:25.400> get<00:01:26.400> yourself<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:26.850> a

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
to put it into reserve get yourself to a

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.969 
to put it into reserve get yourself to a
gas<00:01:27.150> station<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.720> then<00:01:27.869> fill<00:01:28.140> your<00:01:28.170> tank<00:01:28.560> once

gas station and then fill your tank once

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.399 
gas station and then fill your tank once
you've<00:01:29.130> done<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:29.340> put<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:29.939> back<00:01:30.180> down<00:01:30.420> on<00:01:30.750> you

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
you've done that put it back down on you

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:32.719 
you've done that put it back down on you
want<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.619> make<00:01:31.710> sure<00:01:31.740> that<00:01:32.009> it's<00:01:32.159> on<00:01:32.369> at<00:01:32.610> all

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
want to make sure that it's on at all

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.450 
want to make sure that it's on at all
times<00:01:32.759> up<00:01:33.720> into<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.140> right<00:01:34.290> is<00:01:34.500> pry<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.280> I

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
times up into the right is pry and I

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.030 
times up into the right is pry and I
think<00:01:35.759> that's<00:01:35.939> for<00:01:36.409> shipping<00:01:37.409> so<00:01:37.650> you<00:01:37.710> pretty

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
think that's for shipping so you pretty

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.510 
think that's for shipping so you pretty
much<00:01:38.130> never<00:01:38.549> want<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:38.850> use<00:01:39.060> it<00:01:39.240> other<00:01:39.720> than

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
much never want to use it other than

much never want to use it other than
down<00:01:41.520> unless<00:01:42.180> there's<00:01:42.509> something<00:01:42.689> like

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:30.389 
riding with it it'll catch on the fork

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:34.219 
riding with it it'll catch on the fork
and<00:03:30.510> then<00:03:30.659> flip<00:03:31.560> your<00:03:31.709> bike<00:03:31.859> over<00:03:33.199> these<00:03:34.199> are

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:34.229 
and then flip your bike over these are

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:36.680 
and then flip your bike over these are
your<00:03:34.560> front<00:03:35.280> brakes<00:03:35.549> they<00:03:35.849> are<00:03:35.970> hydraulic<00:03:36.569> so

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
your front brakes they are hydraulic so

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:37.969 
your front brakes they are hydraulic so
they<00:03:36.810> actually<00:03:37.079> have<00:03:37.199> more<00:03:37.229> stopping<00:03:37.680> power

00:03:37.969 --> 00:03:37.979 
they actually have more stopping power

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:39.860 
they actually have more stopping power
than<00:03:38.280> your<00:03:38.430> drum<00:03:38.849> brake<00:03:39.120> this<00:03:39.299> is<00:03:39.479> your<00:03:39.629> rear

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
than your drum brake this is your rear

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.770 
than your drum brake this is your rear
brake<00:03:40.250> but<00:03:41.250> use<00:03:41.430> both<00:03:41.699> it's<00:03:42.030> more<00:03:42.389> stable<00:03:42.750> that

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
brake but use both it's more stable that

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:49.219 
brake but use both it's more stable that
way<00:03:45.229> underneath<00:03:46.229> the<00:03:47.540> above<00:03:48.540> the<00:03:48.690> pipe<00:03:48.870> is

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:49.229 
way underneath the above the pipe is

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:52.490 
way underneath the above the pipe is
this<00:03:49.859> little<00:03:50.430> tiny<00:03:50.609> hole<00:03:50.790> here<00:03:51.299> and<00:03:51.540> that<00:03:52.260> is

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
this little tiny hole here and that is

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.070 
this little tiny hole here and that is
the<00:03:52.650> oil

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
the oil

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.120 
the oil
I<00:03:54.110> don't<00:03:54.290> really<00:03:54.380> know<00:03:54.560> it's<00:03:54.710> called<00:03:54.890> but

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
I don't really know it's called but

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:56.980 
I don't really know it's called but
right<00:03:55.670> now<00:03:55.850> it's<00:03:56.030> it's<00:03:56.180> empty<00:03:56.660> because<00:03:56.840> the

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:56.990 
right now it's it's empty because the

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:58.960 
right now it's it's empty because the
bike<00:03:57.170> is<00:03:57.350> leaning<00:03:57.770> and<00:03:57.920> it's<00:03:58.040> off<00:03:58.220> when<00:03:58.880> you

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
bike is leaning and it's off when you

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.700 
bike is leaning and it's off when you
turn<00:03:59.180> it<00:03:59.300> on<00:03:59.390> and<00:03:59.690> things<00:04:00.260> start<00:04:00.440> moving

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:00.710 
turn it on and things start moving
