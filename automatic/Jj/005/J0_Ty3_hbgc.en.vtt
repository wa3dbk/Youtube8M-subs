00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:14.400 
on another thing I noticed was I've been

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.890 
on another thing I noticed was I've been
doing<00:06:14.610> a<00:06:14.669> lot<00:06:14.760> of<00:06:14.820> reading<00:06:15.210> and<00:06:15.330> I<00:06:15.570> believe

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:15.900 
doing a lot of reading and I believe

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.680 
doing a lot of reading and I believe
when<00:06:16.620> you<00:06:16.919> on<00:06:17.490> these<00:06:17.940> spark<00:06:18.240> plugs<00:06:18.300> you're

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:18.690 
when you on these spark plugs you're

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:20.510 
when you on these spark plugs you're
supposed<00:06:18.930> to<00:06:18.990> take<00:06:19.169> that<00:06:19.380> sealing<00:06:20.130> ring<00:06:20.340> off

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:20.520 
supposed to take that sealing ring off

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.400 
supposed to take that sealing ring off
when<00:06:20.849> you<00:06:20.970> use<00:06:21.210> the<00:06:21.419> when<00:06:21.870> they<00:06:21.990> go<00:06:22.139> in<00:06:22.289> the

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:22.410 
when you use the when they go in the

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:24.920 
when you use the when they go in the
spark<00:06:22.680> plug<00:06:22.919> tube<00:06:23.160> some<00:06:23.880> years<00:06:24.210> they<00:06:24.419> don't<00:06:24.660> it

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:24.930 
spark plug tube some years they don't it

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:26.600 
spark plug tube some years they don't it
also<00:06:25.080> depends<00:06:25.560> on<00:06:25.620> the<00:06:25.680> type<00:06:25.919> of<00:06:25.949> spark<00:06:26.370> plug

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:26.610 
also depends on the type of spark plug

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:30.740 
also depends on the type of spark plug
it<00:06:26.760> is<00:06:28.099> so<00:06:29.099> that<00:06:29.280> this<00:06:29.760> ring<00:06:30.090> right<00:06:30.300> here<00:06:30.510> needs

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:30.750 
it is so that this ring right here needs

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:32.390 
it is so that this ring right here needs
to<00:06:30.810> come<00:06:31.020> off<00:06:31.199> the<00:06:31.410> end<00:06:31.590> well<00:06:32.039> I<00:06:32.099> got<00:06:32.250> this

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:32.400 
to come off the end well I got this

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.430 
to come off the end well I got this
thing<00:06:32.580> apart<00:06:32.910> I'm<00:06:33.120> going<00:06:33.240> to<00:06:33.300> be<00:06:33.389> replacing<00:06:34.139> a

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:34.440 
thing apart I'm going to be replacing a

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.290 
thing apart I'm going to be replacing a
few<00:06:34.650> other<00:06:34.770> parts<00:06:35.010> on<00:06:35.280> this<00:06:35.460> so<00:06:35.789> I'm<00:06:35.970> gonna<00:06:36.120> do

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:36.300 
few other parts on this so I'm gonna do

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:38.930 
few other parts on this so I'm gonna do
I'm<00:06:36.599> gonna<00:06:36.690> order<00:06:37.110> up<00:06:37.380> that<00:06:37.680> full<00:06:38.280> gasket<00:06:38.729> set

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:38.940 
I'm gonna order up that full gasket set

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:40.969 
I'm gonna order up that full gasket set
because<00:06:39.210> my<00:06:39.360> valve<00:06:39.630> cover<00:06:39.900> leaks<00:06:40.140> my<00:06:40.469> oil<00:06:40.770> pan

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:40.979 
because my valve cover leaks my oil pan

I<00:06:42.030> believe<00:06:43.020> the<00:06:43.260> rear<00:06:43.440> main<00:06:43.620> seal<00:06:43.650> leaks<00:06:44.340> I'm

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:44.520 
I believe the rear main seal leaks I'm

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:45.530 
I believe the rear main seal leaks I'm
going<00:06:44.640> to<00:06:44.700> try<00:06:44.820> to<00:06:44.880> replace

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:45.540 
going to try to replace

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:47.660 
going to try to replace
