think<00:02:21.810> it's<00:02:21.960> good<00:02:22.290> that<00:02:22.320> it<00:02:22.560> can<00:02:22.710> now<00:02:22.800> be<00:02:22.860> shot

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
think it's good that it can now be shot

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.050 
think it's good that it can now be shot
down<00:02:23.310> or<00:02:23.520> bad

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
down or bad

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.300 
down or bad

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
been frustrated that you couldn't shoot

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.110 
been frustrated that you couldn't shoot
it<00:02:28.980> down<00:02:29.130> so<00:02:29.370> maybe<00:02:29.520> this<00:02:29.610> is<00:02:29.730> a<00:02:29.760> good<00:02:30.060> thing

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
as well the hellstorm missile is

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.490 
as well the hellstorm missile is
actually<00:02:44.850> pretty<00:02:45.150> damn<00:02:45.420> hard<00:02:45.780> to<00:02:45.900> control<00:02:46.200> as

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
actually pretty damn hard to control as

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.380 
actually pretty damn hard to control as
that<00:02:46.620> should<00:02:46.770> be<00:02:46.860> sped<00:02:47.670> up<00:02:47.700> quite<00:02:48.090> a<00:02:48.120> lot<00:02:48.270> you

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
that should be sped up quite a lot you

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.970 
that should be sped up quite a lot you
don't<00:02:48.570> have<00:02:48.720> quite<00:02:48.960> as<00:02:49.110> much<00:02:49.200> time<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:49.740> sort<00:02:49.890> of

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
don't have quite as much time to sort of

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.350 
don't have quite as much time to sort of
thing<00:02:50.160> can<00:02:50.430> work<00:02:50.610> out<00:02:50.820> where<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:51.000> enemies<00:02:51.330> are

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
thing can work out where the enemies are

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.080 
thing can work out where the enemies are
you'll<00:02:51.960> see<00:02:52.170> that<00:02:52.320> in<00:02:52.500> a<00:02:52.560> second<00:02:53.040> in<00:02:53.550> bottom

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
you'll see that in a second in bottom

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.630 
you'll see that in a second in bottom
right<00:02:54.270> in<00:02:54.360> terms<00:02:54.510> of<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:55.050> specialist<00:02:55.920> actual

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
right in terms of the specialist actual

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.700 
right in terms of the specialist actual
ability<00:02:57.210> is<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.570> one<00:02:57.690> that<00:02:57.810> I'm<00:02:57.930> always<00:02:58.200> using

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:58.710 
ability is the one that I'm always using

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.290 
ability is the one that I'm always using
it<00:02:58.860> was<00:02:59.010> a<00:02:59.130> big<00:02:59.340> yellow<00:02:59.670> ring<00:02:59.880> around<00:03:00.000> it

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
it was a big yellow ring around it

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.060 
it was a big yellow ring around it
basically<00:03:00.720> when<00:03:01.140> you<00:03:01.230> activate<00:03:01.740> that<00:03:01.920> it's

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
basically when you activate that it's

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.740

was<00:03:34.770> slowed<00:03:34.920> down<00:03:34.950> a<00:03:35.160> little<00:03:35.340> bit<00:03:35.459> and<00:03:35.580> you<00:03:35.640> can

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
was slowed down a little bit and you can

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.820 
was slowed down a little bit and you can
locate<00:03:35.850> enemies<00:03:36.420> so<00:03:36.510> this<00:03:36.750> is<00:03:36.989> the<00:03:37.140> power<00:03:37.380> call

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
locate enemies so this is the power call

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.890 
locate enemies so this is the power call
it<00:03:38.010> is<00:03:38.580> a<00:03:38.640> deployable<00:03:39.209> device<00:03:39.720> that

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
it is a deployable device that

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.870 
it is a deployable device that
temporarily<00:03:40.110> disables<00:03:40.890> enemies<00:03:41.280> electronics

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
temporarily disables enemies electronics

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.729 
temporarily disables enemies electronics
and<00:03:42.120> reduces<00:03:42.750> the<00:03:42.810> effectiveness<00:03:43.230> for<00:03:43.650> the

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
and reduces the effectiveness for the

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.530 
and reduces the effectiveness for the
enemies<00:03:44.070> thruster<00:03:44.550> assisted<00:03:45.000> movement<00:03:45.390> and

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
enemies thruster assisted movement and

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.140 
enemies thruster assisted movement and
can<00:03:46.320> be<00:03:46.560> destroyed<00:03:47.040> so<00:03:47.700> that<00:03:47.790> means<00:03:47.970> it's<00:03:48.060> now

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
can be destroyed so that means it's now

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.479 
can be destroyed so that means it's now
placed<00:03:48.600> but<00:03:48.810> on<00:03:48.930> the<00:03:49.020> floor<00:03:49.260> similar<00:03:49.920> to<00:03:50.250> the

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
placed but on the floor similar to the

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.000 
placed but on the floor similar to the
chords<00:03:50.730> as<00:03:50.850> it<00:03:50.940> goes<00:03:51.680> SATCOM<00:03:52.680> it<00:03:52.860> can<00:03:52.950> be

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
chords as it goes SATCOM it can be

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.229 
chords as it goes SATCOM it can be
placed<00:03:53.190> on<00:03:53.310> the<00:03:53.340> ground<00:03:53.430> so<00:03:53.760> it<00:03:53.820> can<00:03:54.120> come

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
placed on the ground so it can come

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.240 
placed on the ground so it can come
along<00:03:54.390> and<00:03:54.420> kill<00:03:54.540> it<00:03:54.810> it<00:03:55.200> acts<00:03:55.410> like<00:03:55.620> an<00:03:55.830> EMP

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
along and kill it it acts like an EMP

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.710 
along and kill it it acts like an EMP
but<00:03:56.580> it<00:03:56.790> will<00:03:56.880> also<00:03:57.120> reduce

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
but it will also reduce

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:58.910 
but it will also reduce
enemy's<00:03:58.140> movement<00:03:58.500> when<00:03:58.590> it<00:03:58.680> comes<00:03:58.830> to

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
enemy's movement when it comes to

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.090 
enemy's movement when it comes to
jumping<00:03:59.459> sliding<00:03:59.940> and<00:04:00.480> all<00:04:00.630> of<00:04:00.930> that<00:04:00.959> stuff<00:04:01.739> so

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
jumping sliding and all of that stuff so

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.430 
jumping sliding and all of that stuff so
very<00:04:02.700> very<00:04:02.940> interesting<00:04:03.450> indeed<00:04:03.660> my<00:04:03.900> friends
