you're dealing with is what happens is
that<00:00:29.349> this<00:00:30.349> corrosion<00:00:30.830> that<00:00:31.250> develops<00:00:33.070> right

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
that this corrosion that develops right

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.680 
that this corrosion that develops right
around<00:00:34.280> here<00:00:34.610> this<00:00:34.760> is<00:00:34.820> usually<00:00:35.150> the<00:00:35.240> sticking

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
around here this is usually the sticking

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.000 
around here this is usually the sticking
point<00:00:36.850> where<00:00:37.850> the<00:00:38.030> drum<00:00:38.360> is<00:00:38.750> adhered<00:00:39.500> to<00:00:39.740> the

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
point where the drum is adhered to the

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.280 
point where the drum is adhered to the
wheel<00:00:40.850> bearing<00:00:41.690> assembly<00:00:42.020> and<00:00:43.690> it<00:00:44.690> does<00:00:44.960> help

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:45.290 
wheel bearing assembly and it does help

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:51.280 
wheel bearing assembly and it does help
to<00:00:48.730> just<00:00:49.730> when<00:00:50.300> you<00:00:50.420> get<00:00:50.480> the<00:00:50.630> wheel<00:00:50.780> off<00:00:51.020> take

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:51.290 
to just when you get the wheel off take

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.910 
to just when you get the wheel off take
a<00:00:51.320> hammer

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
a hammer

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.520 
a hammer
don't<00:00:52.130> hit<00:00:52.250> it<00:00:52.370> hard<00:00:52.640> but<00:00:53.600> just<00:00:53.900> you<00:00:54.170> know<00:00:54.260> just

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
don't hit it hard but just you know just

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.510 
don't hit it hard but just you know just
go<00:00:55.040> around<00:00:55.130> tap<00:00:56.800> all<00:00:57.800> the<00:00:57.860> way<00:00:58.100> around<00:00:58.370> the

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
go around tap all the way around the

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:04.900 
go around tap all the way around the
drum<00:00:58.730> and<00:00:59.150> that<00:01:00.100> can<00:01:01.100> help<00:01:02.440> just<00:01:03.440> free<00:01:03.740> up<00:01:03.950> some

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:04.910 
drum and that can help just free up some

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.050 
drum and that can help just free up some
of<00:01:05.030> the<00:01:05.090> sticky<00:01:05.510> spot<00:01:05.810> I<00:01:06.430> you<00:01:07.430> can<00:01:07.550> see<00:01:07.700> I<00:01:07.790> put<00:01:07.850> a

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
of the sticky spot I you can see I put a

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.450 
of the sticky spot I you can see I put a
little<00:01:08.180> penetrating<00:01:08.960> oil<00:01:09.110> on<00:01:09.620> here<00:01:10.040> as<00:01:10.190> well

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
little penetrating oil on here as well

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.240 
little penetrating oil on here as well
as<00:01:10.610> around<00:01:10.760> here

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
as around here

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.800 
as around here
try<00:01:14.060> it<00:01:14.120> by<00:01:14.300> hand<00:01:14.720> it<00:01:14.990> was<00:01:15.110> tight<00:01:15.760> so<00:01:16.760> and<00:01:17.660> I

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
try it by hand it was tight so and I

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.390 
try it by hand it was tight so and I
don't<00:01:18.020> really<00:01:18.170> know<00:01:18.290> what<00:01:18.410> size<00:01:18.680> these<00:01:19.100> holes

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 
don't really know what size these holes

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.360 
don't really know what size these holes
are<00:01:19.670> but<00:01:19.940> you'll<00:01:20.180> see<00:01:20.450> these<00:01:20.660> threaded

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:21.370 
are but you'll see these threaded

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.630 
are but you'll see these threaded
they're<00:01:22.370> already<00:01:22.670> tapped<00:01:23.150> or<00:01:24.340> threaded<00:01:25.340> holes

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
they're already tapped or threaded holes

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.360 
they're already tapped or threaded holes
here<00:01:26.180> get<00:01:27.080> my<00:01:27.200> light<00:01:27.440> in<00:01:27.560> the<00:01:27.620> right<00:01:27.800> spot<00:01:28.190> here

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:30.370 
here get my light in the right spot here

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.710 
here get my light in the right spot here
and<00:01:31.370> I'm<00:01:31.640> not<00:01:31.760> sure<00:01:31.940> what<00:01:32.090> sizes<00:01:32.300> are<00:01:32.600> there

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
and I'm not sure what sizes are there

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.510 
and I'm not sure what sizes are there
probably<00:01:32.960> metric<00:01:33.380> because<00:01:33.680> this<00:01:33.830> is<00:01:33.980> a<00:01:34.010> Toyota

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
probably metric because this is a Toyota

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.510 
probably metric because this is a Toyota

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
with the ratchet wrench just tightened

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.320 
with the ratchet wrench just tightened
and<00:02:23.180> you'll<00:02:24.170> hear<00:02:24.319> the<00:02:24.440> drum<00:02:24.680> pop<00:02:25.120> when<00:02:26.120> the

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
and you'll hear the drum pop when the

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.270 
and you'll hear the drum pop when the
sticky<00:02:26.900> point<00:02:27.200> is<00:02:27.500> reached<00:02:27.770> where<00:02:28.130> it's

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
sticky point is reached where it's

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.080 
sticky point is reached where it's
pulling<00:02:28.700> it<00:02:28.790> away<00:02:28.880> and<00:02:30.100> again<00:02:31.100> I<00:02:31.130> just<00:02:31.520> backed

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
pulling it away and again I just backed

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.760 
pulling it away and again I just backed
it<00:02:32.300> out<00:02:32.420> and<00:02:33.610> alternated<00:02:34.610> between<00:02:34.640> both<00:02:35.120> holes

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
it out and alternated between both holes

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.820 
it out and alternated between both holes
so<00:02:36.770> the<00:02:37.190> end<00:02:37.340> result<00:02:37.520> of<00:02:37.910> course<00:02:38.180> was<00:02:38.450> that<00:02:38.830> the

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
so the end result of course was that the

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:49.990 
so the end result of course was that the
drum<00:02:41.620> loosened<00:02:42.620> up<00:02:43.090> came<00:02:44.090> off<00:02:48.610> and<00:02:49.610> it's<00:02:49.820> off

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
drum loosened up came off and it's off

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.780 
drum loosened up came off and it's off
and<00:02:50.300> my<00:02:50.870> brake<00:02:51.260> shoes<00:02:51.530> are<00:02:51.739> down<00:02:52.220> to<00:02:52.430> the<00:02:52.519> metal

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
and my brake shoes are down to the metal

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.270 
and my brake shoes are down to the metal
so<00:02:53.060> it's<00:02:53.209> kind<00:02:53.630> of<00:02:53.720> replace<00:02:54.050> them<00:02:54.260> so<00:02:54.440> I<00:02:55.010> hope

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
so it's kind of replace them so I hope

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.220 
so it's kind of replace them so I hope
that<00:02:55.310> helps<00:02:55.820> if<00:02:56.150> you<00:02:57.080> have<00:02:57.140> a<00:02:57.230> sticky<00:02:57.620> drum<00:02:57.890> and

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
that helps if you have a sticky drum and

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.600 
that helps if you have a sticky drum and
you<00:03:00.230> hopefully<00:03:00.620> have<00:03:00.650> tapped

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
you hopefully have tapped

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.090 
you hopefully have tapped
there's<00:03:01.940> tap<00:03:02.300> holes<00:03:02.600> in<00:03:02.780> the<00:03:02.870> drum<00:03:03.140> I<00:03:03.440> think

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
there's tap holes in the drum I think

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.309 
there's tap holes in the drum I think
most<00:03:04.310> of<00:03:04.430> these<00:03:04.550> have<00:03:04.760> a<00:03:04.819> hole<00:03:05.569> is<00:03:05.780> tapped<00:03:06.110> in

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 
most of these have a hole is tapped in

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:09.699 
most of these have a hole is tapped in
them<00:03:06.500> to<00:03:07.300> put<00:03:08.300> a<00:03:08.330> dry<00:03:08.600> bolt<00:03:08.959> in<00:03:09.140> to<00:03:09.290> push<00:03:09.500> the

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
them to put a dry bolt in to push the

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.510 
them to put a dry bolt in to push the
drum<00:03:09.950> off<00:03:10.130> hope<00:03:10.910> this<00:03:11.090> helps
