00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.780
 today there is a small one again 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:23.400
 Wish he is this time 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:27.660
 by redhat yes and he wanted to have something 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.610
 with carrots no matter what mail because of that 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.820
 I have chosen completely away and here 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:35.579
 which I tell and scared me 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.620
 but I guess he does not mean that 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.230
 and yes, that's what I thought 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:44.309
 You can only carrot in there 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.410
 pastry crust that do so only once so as 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.309
 first make the dough ready 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.359
 He's a bit too 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.640
 can attract 

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:55.679
 For this I give first five tablespoons 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:01:06.170
 Spelled flour then accounts for five tablespoons 

00:00:55.679 --> 00:01:08.250
 flour and so honest it was tough tablespoon 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.120
 The whole thing could be too 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:15.560
 to stir a dough 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.560
 he needed at least once more between 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:21.140
 5 tablespoons of me more 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:28.860
 then we should be right 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:30.540
 have consistency so you have one 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.380
 dough about a bit thicker 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.909
 is as pancake dough and for the iraq 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.250
 a vague need not always 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.810
 you can find it very practical 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.659
 just without any tools in the 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.869
 right consistency bring then make 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.399
 I just got a teaspoon of salt to it 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:52.560
 then a teaspoon of paprika powder 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:58.200
 and a small teaspoon of turmeric that 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:59.430
 but you can stir in so the dough 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.520
 will first be able to put the page 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:06.539
 pull through a bit now 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.700
 Can you take your men's upper ones 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:11.600
 cut off the ends and the lower ones when 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.600
 they do not look so good 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.800
 then the fantasy is actually there 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.480
 no limits set how do you cut 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.570
 can for example in such slices 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.330
 cut and bread in it in the dough 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.840
 and then roast or even an oblong 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.280
 tire 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.080
 I am here now a two things 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:33.000
 Try and museums like that will 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.030
 here for example now times the 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.910
 elongated stripes 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:41.400
 In any case, you should not too 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.740
 be thick because the several should be so synonymous 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.750
 a bit through then in 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:51.150
 normal times for agree 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:53.460
 the best to hear the bigger ones or at 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:58.140
 some years, the upper ends 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:03:00.470
 are politicians and for the last 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.720
 possibility needs to do a vegetable peelers 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:12.690
 and since virtually the one played just 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:15.870
 down to nothing more than like that 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:19.410
 then you have quasi longer now 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:22.560
 schale and now next could 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.810
 you can still grate by hand , for example 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.640
 would change or in the machine 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.150
 So also likely work 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.650
 There are many possibilities 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.750
 yes that's it the 3ds still try 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.930
 pay for the new I do now 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.790
 think about one to two tablespoons 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.780
 you have to you depending 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:45.300
 depending on the amount always know skimming 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:49.950
 should also not be too much that 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:54.870
 it is in the contract so to speak if you the 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:56.790
 then lightly marinated in the dough 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.070
 It is just right together 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:03.300
 now a flat pan and a 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:04.830
 a bit of oil would smell like a roast 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:08.190
 could you take any other what 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:11.760
 You want it when it's so hot 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:16.979
 you start the little pieces in 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:19.590
 Take the dough to buy 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:23.389
 drain a bit and then in 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.389
 the hot set-fat 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:30.130
 could already be on the 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:33.870
 middle heat down then the 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.870
 elongated pieces as well 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.690
 everyone has a little space for talking 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.690
 this strip 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:54.240
 I'll take it out a little bit now 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:57.470
 At one event, wearing such a small one 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:05:04.140
 shallow and you put her too 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:05.400
 that's hot and you can do it now 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.110
 even a little further down 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.890
 So switch a bit in the half 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.750
 I have that now 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:11.160
 because the carrots are supposed to be one too 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:15.110
 will probably get a bit soft 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.110
 will be a lot of joke despite new 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:25.950
 after two minutes that could then 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:27.180
 Maybe that's how it turned out 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:29.600
 now again eight minutes from the 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.600
 other side 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:42.649
 because we can now also 

00:05:36.899 --> 00:05:47.749
 from the zoo and then, so to speak 

00:05:42.649 --> 00:05:47.749
 higher costs 

00:05:54.589 --> 00:06:01.770
 yummy is nice crunchy also has one 

00:06:00.119 --> 00:06:03.509
 bit ready and the carrots are 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:05.399
 actually become far but even 

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:13.529
 I wrote that one 

00:06:05.399 --> 00:06:16.020
 about 10 cm thick sled yes yummy 

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:18.360
 and this one could be great 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:21.689
 Imagine if you are such a mixed one 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:24.119
 has done that is as it were 

00:06:21.689 --> 00:06:26.699
 once freshly fried 

00:06:24.119 --> 00:06:29.520
 circular considered to I imagine 

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:32.610
 that has more before otherwise 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:35.990
 just everything nice with moments and 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:39.029
 these, so to speak, higher leagues 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:42.389
 yes because something very own because it all so 

00:06:39.029 --> 00:06:43.769
 beautifully mixed together and 

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:46.669
 in any case, that's what everyone goes for 

00:06:43.769 --> 00:06:49.769
 other vegetables as well 

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:51.449
 buccaneer even I think sometimes heat 

00:06:49.769 --> 00:06:53.610
 really keep up the whole time and 

00:06:51.449 --> 00:06:57.689
 there is a lot going on 

00:06:53.610 --> 00:07:03.209
 maybe finished or love alcoholic drinks 

00:06:57.689 --> 00:07:04.259
 imagine or like for example and with the 

00:07:03.209 --> 00:07:06.289
 you can spice a leader 

00:07:04.259 --> 00:07:08.759
 variations also play a bit 

00:07:06.289 --> 00:07:10.319
 with too few olive for example could 

00:07:08.759 --> 00:07:12.899
 I imagine very well even one 

00:07:10.319 --> 00:07:14.639
 to give a little rosemary effect 

00:07:12.899 --> 00:07:16.139
 I would like to have fun again 

00:07:14.639 --> 00:07:17.809
 copying again writes a few 

00:07:16.139 --> 00:07:21.469
 wishes in the comments 

00:07:17.809 --> 00:07:21.469
 nice until next time 

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:29.680
 apa 

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:29.680
 a 

00:07:30.969 --> 00:07:33.209
 apa 

00:07:50.889 --> 00:07:53.550
 was
