00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.419 
some kind of inkjet printer
moving<00:00:28.470> right<00:00:28.500> along<00:00:28.650> this<00:00:28.980> is<00:00:29.099> gonna<00:00:29.189> take<00:00:29.400> a

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
moving right along this is gonna take a

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.339 
moving right along this is gonna take a
little<00:00:29.609> while<00:00:29.760> there's<00:00:30.000> a<00:00:30.060> lot<00:00:30.390> of<00:00:30.869> stuff<00:00:31.109> here

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
little while there's a lot of stuff here

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.889 
little while there's a lot of stuff here
so<00:00:31.650> we<00:00:32.550> have<00:00:32.669> cases<00:00:33.239> some<00:00:33.690> of<00:00:33.809> these

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
so we have cases some of these

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.930 
so we have cases some of these
apparently<00:00:34.649> aren't<00:00:34.860> labeled<00:00:35.160> yet<00:00:35.610> so<00:00:35.820> I<00:00:35.850> guess

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
apparently aren't labeled yet so I guess

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.760 
apparently aren't labeled yet so I guess
they're<00:00:36.329> gonna<00:00:36.420> put<00:00:36.660> prices<00:00:36.870> on<00:00:37.140> them<00:00:37.350> but<00:00:37.530> you

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
difference GX exists 60 so there's a

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.859 
difference GX exists 60 so there's a
