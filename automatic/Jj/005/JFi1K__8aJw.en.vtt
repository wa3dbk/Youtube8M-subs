Malaysian flight that went missing the

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.000 
Malaysian flight that went missing the

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
media is going to be more sensitive for

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.130 
media is going to be more sensitive for
months<00:03:29.280> afterward<00:03:29.790> for<00:03:30.090> other<00:03:30.269> sorts<00:03:30.810> of<00:03:30.930> air

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
months afterward for other sorts of air

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.080 
months afterward for other sorts of air
travel<00:03:31.440> problems<00:03:31.799> because<00:03:32.400> they've<00:03:32.580> seen<00:03:32.850> how

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
travel problems because they've seen how

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.850 
travel problems because they've seen how
much<00:03:33.390> people<00:03:33.930> care<00:03:34.140> about<00:03:34.290> how<00:03:34.560> much<00:03:34.680> they

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
much people care about how much they

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.830 
much people care about how much they
want<00:03:34.980> to<00:03:35.070> see<00:03:35.280> the<00:03:35.489> coverage<00:03:35.970> and<00:03:36.269> so<00:03:36.660> while

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
want to see the coverage and so while

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.090 
want to see the coverage and so while
these<00:03:36.989> flights<00:03:37.230> would<00:03:37.350> probably<00:03:37.680> be<00:03:37.739> covered

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
these flights would probably be covered

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.490 
these flights would probably be covered
in<00:03:38.340> any<00:03:38.519> circumstances<00:03:39.390> the<00:03:40.170> media<00:03:40.440> is

in any circumstances the media is

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.410 
in any circumstances the media is
especially<00:03:41.130> sensitive<00:03:41.310> right<00:03:41.730> now<00:03:41.790> but<00:03:42.299> that

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
especially sensitive right now but that

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:43.640 
especially sensitive right now but that
doesn't<00:03:42.750> mean<00:03:42.870> that<00:03:42.900> because<00:03:43.260> a<00:03:43.290> couple<00:03:43.500> of

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
doesn't mean that because a couple of

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:44.960 
doesn't mean that because a couple of

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
tragic that you shouldn't fly that you

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.410 
tragic that you shouldn't fly that you
