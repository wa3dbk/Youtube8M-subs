we're seeing these red bands within the

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.100 
we're seeing these red bands within the
branches<00:01:38.490> are<00:01:38.820> actually<00:01:39.330> fish<00:01:39.750> hopefully

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
branches are actually fish hopefully

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.560 
branches are actually fish hopefully
crappie<00:01:40.800> hiding<00:01:41.759> in<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:41.910> branches<00:01:42.300> and<00:01:42.450> what

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
crappie hiding in the branches and what

what's it and what we're gonna do is
we're<00:02:07.560> gonna<00:02:07.649> drop<00:02:07.920> down<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.519> the<00:02:08.640> branches

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
we're gonna drop down to the branches

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.210 
we're gonna drop down to the branches
and<00:02:09.420> see<00:02:10.080> if<00:02:10.170> we<00:02:10.229> can<00:02:10.350> pull<00:02:10.530> some<00:02:10.709> crappy<00:02:11.100> out

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
and see if we can pull some crappy out

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.310 
and see if we can pull some crappy out
see<00:02:11.430> these<00:02:11.580> red<00:02:11.790> marks<00:02:12.180> here<00:02:12.480> in<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:12.900> branches

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
see these red marks here in the branches

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.310 
see these red marks here in the branches
those<00:02:13.500> are<00:02:13.620> actually<00:02:14.010> fish<00:02:14.720> the<00:02:15.720> electronics

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
those are actually fish the electronics

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.720 
those are actually fish the electronics
take<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:16.680> guesswork<00:02:17.040> out<00:02:17.160> of<00:02:17.489> it<00:02:17.610> you<00:02:17.700> know

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
take the guesswork out of it you know

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.520 
take the guesswork out of it you know
exactly<00:02:18.390> where<00:02:18.720> you<00:02:18.900> are<00:02:18.930> you<00:02:19.290> know<00:02:19.410> exactly

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
exactly where you are you know exactly

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.710 
exactly where you are you know exactly
what<00:02:20.070> you're<00:02:20.220> looking<00:02:20.489> at<00:02:20.640> and<00:02:20.880> you<00:02:21.360> can<00:02:21.510> see

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
what you're looking at and you can see

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.660 
what you're looking at and you can see
how<00:02:21.900> these<00:02:22.049> fish<00:02:22.350> are<00:02:22.560> reacting<00:02:23.220> to<00:02:23.370> your

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
how these fish are reacting to your

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.240 
how these fish are reacting to your
jigging<00:02:24.150> some<00:02:24.390> days<00:02:24.570> they<00:02:24.780> want<00:02:24.989> it<00:02:25.110> snaps<00:02:26.040> are

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
jigging some days they want it snaps are

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.530 
jigging some days they want it snaps are
really<00:02:26.489> hard<00:02:26.700> and<00:02:26.850> other<00:02:26.970> days<00:02:27.209> it's<00:02:27.480> just

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
really hard and other days it's just

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.069 
really hard and other days it's just
kind<00:02:27.870> of<00:02:27.900> feathering<00:02:28.910> so<00:02:29.910> let's<00:02:30.660> drop<00:02:30.870> these

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:31.079 
kind of feathering so let's drop these

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:34.220 
kind of feathering so let's drop these
jigs<00:02:31.410> down<00:02:32.510> let's<00:02:33.510> see<00:02:33.690> if<00:02:33.750> we<00:02:33.840> can't<00:02:34.079> get

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
jigs down let's see if we can't get

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.390 
jigs down let's see if we can't get
somebody<00:02:34.440> to<00:02:34.620> come<00:02:34.799> up<00:02:34.950> out<00:02:35.100> of<00:02:35.130> the<00:02:35.250> brush

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
somebody to come up out of the brush

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.090 
somebody to come up out of the brush
here<00:02:35.820> I'm<00:02:36.209> gonna<00:02:36.360> stop<00:02:36.660> it<00:02:36.900> just<00:02:37.290> above<00:02:37.739> the

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
here I'm gonna stop it just above the

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.840 
here I'm gonna stop it just above the
branches<00:02:38.670> so<00:02:39.350> that<00:02:40.350> we<00:02:40.620> can<00:02:40.799> watch<00:02:41.310> them<00:02:41.519> come

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
branches so that we can watch them come

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.640 
branches so that we can watch them come
up<00:02:41.880> out<00:02:42.209> of<00:02:42.239> there

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.800 

and<00:02:44.950> again<00:02:45.250> this<00:02:45.400> is<00:02:45.580> a<00:02:45.610> this<00:02:45.940> is<00:02:46.269> a<00:02:46.299> fish<00:02:46.599> here

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
and again this is a this is a fish here

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.899 
and again this is a this is a fish here
that<00:02:46.989> red<00:02:47.200> light<00:02:47.470> that<00:02:47.920> line<00:02:48.400> is<00:02:48.610> flickering

00:02:48.899 --> 00:02:48.909 
that red light that line is flickering

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:51.570 
that red light that line is flickering
see<00:02:49.870> if<00:02:49.959> we<00:02:50.080> can't<00:02:50.349> get<00:02:50.530> him<00:02:50.620> to<00:02:50.769> see<00:02:51.220> the<00:02:51.370> jig

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
see if we can't get him to see the jig

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:52.530 
see if we can't get him to see the jig
here<00:02:51.849> he<00:02:51.909> comes<00:02:52.120> now

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
here he comes now

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.720 
here he comes now
here<00:02:53.019> he<00:02:53.140> comes<00:02:53.379> right<00:02:54.129> up<00:02:54.280> out<00:02:54.459> of<00:02:54.580> the<00:02:54.640> brush

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
here he comes right up out of the brush

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.580 
here he comes right up out of the brush
bang<00:02:55.349> fish<00:02:56.349> on<00:02:57.720> it<00:02:58.720> just<00:02:58.959> doesn't<00:02:59.290> get<00:02:59.379> any

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
bang fish on it just doesn't get any

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.809 
bang fish on it just doesn't get any
easier<00:03:00.060> there's<00:03:01.060> no<00:03:01.329> way<00:03:01.540> I<00:03:01.569> could<00:03:01.959> do<00:03:02.110> this

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
easier there's no way I could do this

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:07.229 
easier there's no way I could do this
without<00:03:03.819> the<00:03:04.090> hummingbird<00:03:04.569> 597<00:03:05.970> gets<00:03:06.970> me<00:03:07.120> on

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
without the hummingbird 597 gets me on

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.530 
without the hummingbird 597 gets me on
my<00:03:07.450> way<00:03:07.629> points<00:03:08.610> and<00:03:09.610> I<00:03:09.730> know<00:03:09.790> exactly<00:03:10.239> what's

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
my way points and I know exactly what's

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.780 
my way points and I know exactly what's
going<00:03:10.690> on<00:03:10.870> down<00:03:11.110> there<00:03:11.140> we're<00:03:11.950> after<00:03:12.159> crappie

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
going on down there we're after crappie

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.229 
going on down there we're after crappie
but<00:03:13.000> that's<00:03:13.870> a<00:03:14.049> that's<00:03:15.010> a<00:03:15.190> healthy<00:03:15.519> bluegill<00:03:15.970> I

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
but that's a that's a healthy bluegill I

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:20.430 
but that's a that's a healthy bluegill I
don't<00:03:17.230> know<00:03:17.319> what's<00:03:17.530> at<00:03:17.709> jig<00:03:18.900> but<00:03:19.900> you<00:03:20.109> saw<00:03:20.319> him

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
don't know what's at jig but you saw him

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.890 
don't know what's at jig but you saw him
come<00:03:20.590> right<00:03:20.769> out<00:03:20.799> of<00:03:20.950> the<00:03:21.099> branches<00:03:21.900> pretty

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
come right out of the branches pretty

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
come right out of the branches pretty
cool<00:03:25.769> drop<00:03:26.769> down<00:03:26.980> and<00:03:27.160> do<00:03:27.250> it<00:03:27.370> again

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.830

bang I missed him but there he goes
that's<00:03:51.310> the<00:03:51.459> fish<00:03:51.640> heading<00:03:51.910> back<00:03:52.060> down<00:03:52.270> into

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
that's the fish heading back down into

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.440 
that's the fish heading back down into
the<00:03:52.599> brush<00:03:53.310> drop<00:03:54.310> the<00:03:54.520> jig<00:03:54.730> back<00:03:54.970> down<00:03:55.239> there

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
the brush drop the jig back down there

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.120 
the brush drop the jig back down there
again<00:03:55.830> here<00:03:56.830> comes<00:03:57.069> another<00:03:57.220> one

he's a little more cautious this could

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.830 
he's a little more cautious this could
be<00:04:01.480> a<00:04:01.510> crappie

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.390 

tiny<00:04:06.500> little<00:04:06.770> jigs<00:04:07.220> there<00:04:09.130> he's<00:04:10.130> on<00:04:10.250> the

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
tiny little jigs there he's on the

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.580 
tiny little jigs there he's on the
dropper<00:04:10.790> now<00:04:11.950> Miss<00:04:12.950> Dolly<00:04:14.050> he<00:04:15.050> was<00:04:15.200> looking<00:04:15.500> at

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
dropper now Miss Dolly he was looking at
