00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
something long lines of that I

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.359 
something long lines of that I
definitely<00:01:34.380> wanted<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:34.710> make<00:01:34.920> sense<00:01:35.159> at<00:01:35.280> the

definitely wanted to make sense at the

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.039 
definitely wanted to make sense at the
very<00:01:35.520> least<00:01:35.670> it<00:01:35.880> can't<00:01:36.119> be<00:01:36.299> that<00:01:36.329> he<00:01:36.659> returns

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
very least it can't be that he returns

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.810 
very least it can't be that he returns
and<00:01:37.320> he's<00:01:37.530> kicking<00:01:37.920> ass<00:01:38.100> with<00:01:38.430> no<00:01:38.460> explanation

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
and he's kicking ass with no explanation

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.819 
and he's kicking ass with no explanation
as<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.299> how<00:01:39.540> he<00:01:39.780> got<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.320> level<00:01:40.590> which<00:01:40.710> I'm

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
as to how he got to the level which I'm

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.679 
as to how he got to the level which I'm
sure<00:01:41.040> they<00:01:41.220> won't<00:01:41.400> do<00:01:41.640> that<00:01:41.670> but<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.450> really

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
sure they won't do that but it really

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.420

the anime I felt as though she was
supposed<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:05.579> be<00:02:05.700> Gohan's<00:02:06.119> coming<00:02:06.509> of<00:02:06.600> age<00:02:06.750> and

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
supposed to be Gohan's coming of age and

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.719 
supposed to be Gohan's coming of age and
kind<00:02:07.469> of<00:02:07.560> taking<00:02:07.920> up<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.160> mantle<00:02:08.310> that<00:02:08.640> his

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
kind of taking up the mantle that his

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.699 
kind of taking up the mantle that his
father<00:02:08.910> left<00:02:09.119> behind<00:02:09.479> so<00:02:09.690> in<00:02:09.899> this<00:02:10.140> movie<00:02:10.560> I

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
father left behind so in this movie I

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.350

think<00:02:11.160> Gohan<00:02:11.520> and<00:02:11.550> Vegeta<00:02:11.970> definitely

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
think Gohan and Vegeta definitely

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.490

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
and just overall goal tenant trunks have

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.479 
and just overall goal tenant trunks have
their<00:02:49.470> moments<00:02:49.800> because<00:02:49.920> when<00:02:50.340> they<00:02:50.430> were

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
their moments because when they were

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:51.800 
their moments because when they were
little<00:02:50.640> and<00:02:50.940> they<00:02:51.120> first<00:02:51.360> showed<00:02:51.420> up<00:02:51.570> I

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
little and they first showed up I

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.540 
little and they first showed up I
remember<00:02:52.050> thinking<00:02:52.170> to<00:02:52.350> myself<00:02:52.380> like<00:02:52.800> this<00:02:53.340> is

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
remember thinking to myself like this is

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.310 
remember thinking to myself like this is
the<00:02:53.670> next<00:02:53.820> generation<00:02:54.000> these<00:02:54.600> other<00:02:54.780> new<00:02:54.930> Goku

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
the next generation these other new Goku

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.990 
the next generation these other new Goku
Vegeta<00:02:55.470> and<00:02:55.920> they<00:02:56.220> never<00:02:56.310> really<00:02:56.580> amounted<00:02:56.790> to

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
Vegeta and they never really amounted to

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.820 
Vegeta and they never really amounted to
that<00:02:57.239> so<00:02:57.420> maybe<00:02:57.600> in<00:02:57.780> this<00:02:57.900> film<00:02:58.170> we<00:02:58.380> can<00:02:58.680> get

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
after that we can face them most

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.759 
after that we can face them most
importantly<00:03:51.570> while<00:03:51.810> I<00:03:51.840> do<00:03:51.989> like<00:03:52.290> the<00:03:52.410> comedy
