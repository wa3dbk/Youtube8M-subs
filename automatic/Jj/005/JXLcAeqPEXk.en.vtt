finally<00:01:30.700> we've<00:01:30.940> introduced<00:01:31.330> the<00:01:31.450> discharge

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:31.899 
finally we've introduced the discharge

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:33.899 
finally we've introduced the discharge
checklist<00:01:31.990> where<00:01:32.950> nursing<00:01:33.280> staff<00:01:33.520> makes<00:01:33.759> your

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:33.909 
checklist where nursing staff makes your

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:35.520 
checklist where nursing staff makes your
patients<00:01:34.330> are<00:01:34.420> clear<00:01:34.750> about<00:01:34.869> their<00:01:35.170> medicines

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
patients are clear about their medicines

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.430 
patients are clear about their medicines
for<00:01:36.190> example<00:01:36.670> the<00:01:36.880> indications<00:01:37.539> changes<00:01:38.350> in

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
for example the indications changes in

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:46.460 
for example the indications changes in
medications<00:01:38.770> we<00:01:39.340> common<00:01:39.640> side<00:01:39.819> effects

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.640 

I<00:01:46.500> think<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.340> medicine<00:01:47.580> checklist<00:01:48.060> is<00:01:48.180> good

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:48.650 
I think the medicine checklist is good

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.830 
I think the medicine checklist is good
because<00:01:49.650> it's<00:01:49.980> a<00:01:50.100> new<00:01:50.280> practice<00:01:50.610> we<00:01:51.570> can<00:01:51.690> learn

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
because it's a new practice we can learn

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.450 
because it's a new practice we can learn
through<00:01:52.170> with<00:01:52.410> it<00:01:52.500> with<00:01:52.650> the<00:01:52.740> page<00:01:52.920> there's

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
through with it with the page there's

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.790 
through with it with the page there's
another<00:01:53.850> thing<00:01:54.090> it's<00:01:54.350> medicine<00:01:55.350> we<00:01:55.710> were

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
another thing it's medicine we were

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.880 
another thing it's medicine we were
talking<00:01:56.130> about<00:01:56.450> but<00:01:57.450> I<00:01:57.750> think<00:01:58.110> for<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.440> nurses

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
talking about but I think for the nurses

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.740 
talking about but I think for the nurses
from<00:01:59.220> the<00:01:59.340> nurses<00:01:59.760> point<00:02:00.090> of<00:02:00.240> view<00:02:00.420> we<00:02:00.570> don't

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
from the nurses point of view we don't

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.380 
from the nurses point of view we don't
have<00:02:00.930> enough<00:02:01.890> time<00:02:02.190> in<00:02:02.460> that<00:02:03.030> medicine

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
have enough time in that medicine

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.510 
have enough time in that medicine

explain<00:02:05.910> the<00:02:06.090> indication<00:02:06.630> for<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.810> medicine

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
explain the indication for the medicine

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.320

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.400 
is if the box when you say what
medicines<00:02:22.800> discontinued<00:02:24.140> obviously<00:02:25.140> to

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
medicines discontinued obviously to

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.740 
medicines discontinued obviously to
continue<00:02:26.070> taking<00:02:26.430> so<00:02:26.730> that<00:02:26.760> we<00:02:26.940> can<00:02:27.120> expand<00:02:27.720> to

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
continue taking so that we can expand to

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.100 
continue taking so that we can expand to
patients<00:02:28.790> I'm<00:02:29.790> really<00:02:30.450> pleased<00:02:30.720> that<00:02:30.900> we've

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
patients I'm really pleased that we've

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.810 
patients I'm really pleased that we've
been<00:02:31.290> involved<00:02:31.560> in<00:02:31.830> this<00:02:32.010> improvement

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
been involved in this improvement

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.890 
been involved in this improvement
project<00:02:33.540> I<00:02:33.600> think<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:33.930> absence

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
project I think the absence

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.580 
project I think the absence
so<00:02:35.230> much<00:02:35.409> damage<00:02:35.890> as<00:02:36.220> you

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
so much damage as you

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.740 
so much damage as you
one<00:02:37.920> of<00:02:38.070> the<00:02:38.130> things<00:02:38.370> that<00:02:38.610> Ford<00:02:38.910> is<00:02:39.270> very

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
one of the things that Ford is very

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.280 
one of the things that Ford is very
interested<00:02:40.410> in<00:02:41.120> patient<00:02:42.120> safety<00:02:42.300> how<00:02:43.110> we

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
interested in patient safety how we

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.970 
interested in patient safety how we
improve<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:44.930> patient<00:02:45.930> experience<00:02:45.960> and<00:02:46.890> it

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
improve the patient experience and it

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.400 
improve the patient experience and it
seems<00:02:47.220> to<00:02:47.400> me<00:02:47.520> this<00:02:47.730> whole<00:02:48.120> project<00:02:48.660> does<00:02:49.110> that

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
seems to me this whole project does that

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.810 
seems to me this whole project does that
it<00:02:50.040> takes<00:02:50.220> people<00:02:51.350> time<00:02:52.350> it<00:02:53.010> helps<00:02:53.250> them<00:02:53.640> to

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
it takes people time it helps them to

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.730 
it takes people time it helps them to
navigate<00:02:54.480> through<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:54.870> changes<00:02:55.410> in<00:02:55.560> the

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
navigate through the changes in the

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.980 
navigate through the changes in the
medication<00:02:56.550> it<00:02:57.000> gets<00:02:57.270> a<00:02:57.390> multidisciplinary

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
medication it gets a multidisciplinary

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.870 
medication it gets a multidisciplinary
team<00:02:58.410> really<00:02:59.010> think<00:02:59.280> you<00:02:59.520> know<00:02:59.670> what's

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
team really think you know what's

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.000 
team really think you know what's
happening<00:03:00.390> medication<00:03:01.260> have<00:03:01.470> been<00:03:01.650> taken<00:03:01.920> the

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
happening medication have been taken the

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.640 
happening medication have been taken the
time<00:03:02.220> to<00:03:02.430> explain<00:03:02.820> to<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:03.600> patient<00:03:03.780> so<00:03:04.470> the

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
time to explain to the patient so the

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.710 
time to explain to the patient so the
patient<00:03:04.920> was<00:03:05.460> out<00:03:05.670> there's<00:03:06.210> not<00:03:06.390> the<00:03:06.570> same

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
patient was out there's not the same

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.320 
patient was out there's not the same
chance<00:03:06.990> of<00:03:07.170> readmission<00:03:07.710> because

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
chance of readmission because

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.480 
chance of readmission because
music<00:03:10.020> it<00:03:10.350> also<00:03:10.530> keeps<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.010> health<00:03:11.250> community

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
music it also keeps the health community

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.780 
music it also keeps the health community
the<00:03:12.090> GPS<00:03:12.570> and<00:03:13.140> involved<00:03:13.860> what's<00:03:14.280> been<00:03:14.550> going

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
the GPS and involved what's been going

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.300 
the GPS and involved what's been going
on<00:03:15.000> and<00:03:15.630> I<00:03:15.660> think<00:03:15.750> that<00:03:16.020> allows<00:03:16.500> us<00:03:16.560> to<00:03:17.010> do<00:03:17.130> as

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
on and I think that allows us to do as

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.040 
on and I think that allows us to do as
an<00:03:17.460> organization<00:03:17.550> is<00:03:18.300> to<00:03:18.330> become<00:03:18.690> much<00:03:18.870> more

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
an organization is to become much more

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:20.420 
an organization is to become much more
productive<00:03:19.410> because<00:03:19.830> we<00:03:20.070> don't<00:03:20.250> have<00:03:20.340> a

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
productive because we don't have a

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.150 
productive because we don't have a
sickness<00:03:20.730> look<00:03:21.440> readmissions<00:03:22.440> nothing<00:03:22.830> here

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
sickness look readmissions nothing here

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.980 
sickness look readmissions nothing here
and<00:03:23.370> that<00:03:23.700> really<00:03:23.940> fits<00:03:24.300> in<00:03:24.510> with<00:03:24.750> work

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:24.990 
and that really fits in with work

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:26.700 
and that really fits in with work
challenges<00:03:25.590> that<00:03:25.710> we've<00:03:25.890> got

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:26.710 
challenges that we've got

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:31.350 
challenges that we've got
the<00:03:27.580> quality<00:03:28.090> innovation<00:03:28.570> prevention<00:03:29.530> and<00:03:30.360> I

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
the quality innovation prevention and I

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.570 
the quality innovation prevention and I
think<00:03:31.840> that's<00:03:32.050> really<00:03:32.290> great<00:03:32.560> help<00:03:33.220> support

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
think that's really great help support

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.430 
think that's really great help support
their<00:03:33.700> sequin<00:03:34.060> as<00:03:34.180> well<00:03:34.390> because<00:03:35.290> we

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
their sequin as well because we

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.380 
their sequin as well because we
shouldn't<00:03:35.740> see<00:03:36.100> their<00:03:36.310> readmission<00:03:36.790> so<00:03:37.360> I

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
shouldn't see their readmission so I

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:38.940 
shouldn't see their readmission so I
think<00:03:37.540> you<00:03:37.840> need<00:03:37.990> to<00:03:38.020> think<00:03:38.110> about<00:03:38.440> this<00:03:38.710> I

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
think you need to think about this I

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.550 
think you need to think about this I
have<00:03:39.160> economy<00:03:39.820> initiative<00:03:40.180> and<00:03:40.780> look<00:03:41.260> at<00:03:41.410> how

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
have economy initiative and look at how

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.950 
have economy initiative and look at how
actually<00:03:42.160> saving<00:03:42.760> money<00:03:43.090> is<00:03:43.570> improving

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:45.960 
actually saving money is improving

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.140 
actually saving money is improving
our<00:03:46.170> population<00:03:46.710> but<00:03:47.130> also<00:03:47.250> it's<00:03:47.670> making<00:03:48.030> the

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
our population but also it's making the

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.550 
our population but also it's making the
team<00:03:48.420> think<00:03:48.840> about<00:03:49.050> things<00:03:49.290> in<00:03:49.440> a<00:03:49.530> different

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
team think about things in a different

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.880 
team think about things in a different
way

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 
way

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.310 
way
they're<00:03:51.130> actually<00:03:51.880> recognizing<00:03:52.780> that<00:03:53.140> it's

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
they're actually recognizing that it's

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.260 
they're actually recognizing that it's
good<00:03:53.590> to<00:03:53.620> spend<00:03:54.100> time<00:03:54.250> with<00:03:54.580> a<00:03:54.730> patient<00:03:55.180> but

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:55.270 
good to spend time with a patient but

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.770 
good to spend time with a patient but
more<00:03:55.570> important<00:03:56.170> eternities<00:03:56.650> heart<00:03:56.950> is<00:03:57.280> that

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
more important eternities heart is that

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.180 
more important eternities heart is that
think<00:03:59.780> of<00:03:59.930> it

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
think of it

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.430 
think of it
this<00:04:02.190> changing<00:04:02.700> practice<00:04:03.270> not<00:04:03.810> just<00:04:04.050> for<00:04:04.230> just

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
this changing practice not just for just

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.600 
this changing practice not just for just
night

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
night

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.700 
night
for<00:04:06.730> the<00:04:06.790> future<00:04:07.090> I<00:04:07.540> think<00:04:08.110> it's<00:04:08.260> a<00:04:08.410> huge

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:08.710 
for the future I think it's a huge

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.420 
for the future I think it's a huge
potential<00:04:09.220> so<00:04:09.550> I'm<00:04:09.640> gonna<00:04:09.910> keep<00:04:10.210> it
