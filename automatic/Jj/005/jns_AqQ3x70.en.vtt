00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
important impression I think the people

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.380 
important impression I think the people
also<00:02:50.630> the<00:02:51.530> landscape<00:02:51.830> like<00:02:52.520> for<00:02:52.730> today<00:02:53.150> ones

than<00:02:57.380> I<00:02:57.620> thought<00:02:57.800> I<00:02:58.100> thought<00:02:58.370> it<00:02:58.489> would<00:02:59.060> be

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
than I thought I thought it would be

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.970 
than I thought I thought it would be
more<00:02:59.330> dry<00:02:59.570> so<00:02:59.720> I<00:02:59.780> guess<00:02:59.959> you<00:03:00.050> have<00:03:00.140> had<00:03:00.290> a<00:03:00.320> great

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
more dry so I guess you have had a great

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.870 
more dry so I guess you have had a great
rain<00:03:01.519> period<00:03:02.980> but<00:03:03.980> I<00:03:04.010> think<00:03:04.220> the<00:03:04.519> lasting

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
rain period but I think the lasting

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.060 
rain period but I think the lasting
impression<00:03:04.940> so<00:03:05.390> far<00:03:05.600> is<00:03:05.720> the<00:03:06.680> meeting<00:03:06.950> with

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
impression so far is the meeting with

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.040 
impression so far is the meeting with
the<00:03:07.160> people<00:03:07.340> the<00:03:08.000> most<00:03:08.209> important<00:03:08.810> thing<00:03:09.019> that

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
the people the most important thing that

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.160 
the people the most important thing that
is<00:03:09.620> that<00:03:09.950> it<00:03:10.100> is<00:03:10.370> really<00:03:10.880> used<00:03:11.120> not<00:03:11.510> to<00:03:11.660> stop<00:03:11.930> it

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
is that it is really used not to stop it

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.620
