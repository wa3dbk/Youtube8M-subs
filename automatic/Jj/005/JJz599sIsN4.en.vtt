00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.789
 I would take me 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.830
 welcome to the memorable jump 5 the 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.910

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.370
 memorable and this time we met 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.930
 with an assassin's creed 3 clip on the 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.640
 that my colleagues are eliminating 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.230
 the enemy soldiers but so 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.060
 infiltrated us meanwhile 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.550
 we transport a series of prisons 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.900
 waiting for the last goodbye 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.790
 now look at our two in front 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.120
 like there are people who mess too much with 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.120
 your paper 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:09.290
 and not only personal, but for home 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.060

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.650

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.540
 path that seems that nobody has seen 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.520
 forever 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.130
 it's a disaster 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.750

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.670
 no problems the second also but 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.670
 with the third one a surprise awaits us 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:55.000
 he has the sacred and legendary technique 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.000
 of the 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.409
 in our next there is such a man 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.119
 bad so bad that it entertains the 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:09.590
 late stealing in the car infinity of 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.450
 times in my face while your partner 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.250

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.130
 around me as he says is a companion of 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.350
 what I said this man is bad bad 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.030

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.280
 happens he stole the car if he wants and now 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.709
 I do not want to steal from you now I go out and 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.510
 Now I'm leaving because I'm not leaving because 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.130
 he was hiding the grandfather of the 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.930
 robberies does not call boquete the robots in the 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.190
 order of a first turn of cockiness 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.190
 no and now if you steal them 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.650
 how do you say that better 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.320
 if you want to know how to differentiate a guy 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.450
 normal from a hard guy because they are very 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.230
 similar does not work only with 3par parents 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.940
 you also have to know how to do this 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.409
 no doubt this man has brand of 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.409
 quality is one 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.440

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.340

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.430
 in our next critical we to 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:10.620
 a teacher of the century the external lack 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.150
 of your body in such a way that you can 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.160
 avoid our attacks without 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.459
 I decided to touch him and he can 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:20.329
 even inflection damage by the fact of 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.329
 be near him 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.700
 even though 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.850
 in this man 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:43.610

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.840

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.840

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.969
 same with the Chinese conquest that 

00:05:23.959 --> 00:05:27.679
 spread through the world that we have up to 

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:29.059
 where we can take many 

00:05:27.679 --> 00:05:30.469

00:05:29.059 --> 00:05:33.110
