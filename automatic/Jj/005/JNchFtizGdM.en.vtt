00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:10.260
 tilapia is today the main species of 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:13.440
 fish grown in Brazil and the second 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.460
 species produced by the crop in the 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.490
 world 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.609
 Attila has a strong international market 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.890
 but we also have here in Brazil is a 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.160
 large internal market for 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.779
 today practically everybody washes 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.750
 produced in our country 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.790
 it is destined to the domestic market with 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.600
 a great acceptance 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.850
 It was not always like this . 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.100
 a very bad reputation that usually 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.620
 was a fish from the fishing 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.379
 capture in lakes and dams 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.590
 the clay -sized fish 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:53.160
 small is considered as a fish full of 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:56.039
 thorns but this started to change with the 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.100
 agriculture with the controlled production of 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.289
 side from the 90s 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.140
 tilapia fingerlings 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:07.110
 started employing the 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.140
 sexual reversal technique, ie the 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.280
 process of masculinization of lots of 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.270
 fry this process this technology 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.310
 was very important for the 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.490
 development of tilapia in our country 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.189
 and in several other countries in the world 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:26.729
 through sexual reversal it is possible 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:29.130
 masculinized get lots of fry and 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.860
 thereby reducing the problems of 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.860
 playback touch lapa along the 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:38.070
 cultivation usually when cultivated 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:41.369
 tilapia with lots of mixed sex be 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.450
 50% plus 50% female without any 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.799
 treatment 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.810
 the route during the fattening process 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:50.880
 excessive reproduction of these fish in the 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.049
 tanks, that is to say, it began to 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.140
 reproduce 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:57.659
 before reaching a commercial weight and with 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.729
 the producer lost control of the 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.100
 stock there were a large number of fish 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.530
 small ones without great value 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.450
 from the moment they were used 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.369
 reverted fry 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.530
 the producer had a better control of the 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.900
 stocks of fish in their tanks and 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:17.430
 can produce an athlete of greater 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:20.519
 the mother is this greater tilapia differentiated the 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:23.459
 product of the product coming from the 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:26.189
 fisheries and made it possible for 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.329
 value added to this product of the 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:30.629
 sculpture 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:33.870
 the main focus is the production 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:37.079
 tilapia in Brazil until then in the 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.870
 90 was the western part of ParanÃ¡ where there 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:40.769
 expressive production of tilapia in trance 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.109
 Earth 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:45.540
 production, it still exists today. 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:49.680
 still a major producer of 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:52.159
 But tilapia tilapia has spread to 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.260
 tilapia in Brazil everything is 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:58.230
 both in thesis as well as in 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:01.439
 tanks-networks, the present-day 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:04.709
 principal producer of tilapia in Brazil 

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:07.980
 is about the production of tilapia in tanks 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:11.879
 excavated we will treat this case the 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:15.030
 techniques for breeding and breeding 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:17.819
 management strategies will be discussed 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:20.900
 so that you can implement in 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:24.000
 fish farming the differentiated management 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.569
 more efficient management of your 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.569
 fish
