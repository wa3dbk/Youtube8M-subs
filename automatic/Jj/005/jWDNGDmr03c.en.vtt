how<00:00:56.370> we<00:00:56.430> can<00:00:56.610> do<00:00:56.760> this<00:00:56.910> on<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.449> road<00:00:57.600> but<00:00:57.960> first

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
how we can do this on the road but first

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.810 
how we can do this on the road but first
I<00:00:58.410> think<00:00:58.469> I<00:00:58.739> need<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:58.980> change<00:00:59.160> into<00:00:59.489> something

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
I think I need to change into something

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.240 
I think I need to change into something
a<00:01:00.210> little<00:01:00.390> bit<00:01:00.539> more<00:01:00.629> suitable<00:01:01.079> so<00:01:01.410> I<00:01:01.680> see<00:01:02.129> on

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
a little bit more suitable so I see on

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.940 
a little bit more suitable so I see on
the<00:01:02.340> road

the<00:01:05.950> great<00:01:06.160> thing<00:01:06.340> about<00:01:06.550> the<00:01:07.030> rower<00:01:07.240> is<00:01:07.480> that

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
the great thing about the rower is that

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.780 
the great thing about the rower is that
I<00:01:07.750> can<00:01:08.050> control<00:01:08.440> the<00:01:08.680> pace<00:01:08.920> at<00:01:09.280> which<00:01:09.340> I'm

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
I can control the pace at which I'm

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.670 
I can control the pace at which I'm
going<00:01:10.090> for<00:01:10.540> example<00:01:10.960> if<00:01:11.080> I'm<00:01:11.230> on<00:01:11.380> a<00:01:11.410> treadmill

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
going for example if I'm on a treadmill

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.920 
going for example if I'm on a treadmill
I<00:01:12.010> need<00:01:12.430> to<00:01:12.550> actually<00:01:12.700> hit<00:01:13.330> the<00:01:13.390> button<00:01:13.810> to

I need to actually hit the button to

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.900 
I need to actually hit the button to
increase<00:01:14.260> the<00:01:14.440> speed<00:01:14.680> and<00:01:14.890> that<00:01:15.280> delays<00:01:15.610> time

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:15.910 
increase the speed and that delays time

the<00:01:16.210> whole<00:01:16.390> point<00:01:16.660> of<00:01:16.780> integral<00:01:17.230> training<00:01:17.560> is

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:17.650 
the whole point of integral training is

which I'm going to do 30 seconds now I'm
going<00:01:59.240> to<00:01:59.329> go<00:01:59.390> 30<00:01:59.719> seconds<00:02:00.200> all-out<00:02:00.500> effort<00:02:01.070> as

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
going to go 30 seconds all-out effort as

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.499

I'm<00:02:03.289> going<00:02:03.439> to<00:02:03.530> crank<00:02:03.740> my<00:02:03.920> heart<00:02:04.189> rate<00:02:04.369> up

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
I'm going to crank my heart rate up

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.479 

increase<00:02:07.270> my<00:02:07.420> body<00:02:07.659> temperature<00:02:08.310> and<00:02:09.310> then

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
increase my body temperature and then

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:12.030 
increase my body temperature and then
I'll<00:02:09.759> allow<00:02:10.000> 30<00:02:10.810> second<00:02:11.200> recovery<00:02:11.440> certainly

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
I'll allow 30 second recovery certainly

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.000 
I'll allow 30 second recovery certainly
for<00:02:12.190> the<00:02:12.250> first<00:02:12.280> few<00:02:12.760> stages<00:02:13.830> last<00:02:14.830> few

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
for the first few stages last few

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:40.890 
for the first few stages last few
seconds<00:02:16.140> here<00:02:17.140> we<00:02:17.200> go

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.950 

okay<00:02:41.950> that's<00:02:42.950> the<00:02:43.100> first<00:02:43.130> we've<00:02:43.550> done<00:02:43.760> now<00:02:44.750> in

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960 
okay that's the first we've done now in

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.960 
okay that's the first we've done now in
the<00:02:45.080> early<00:02:45.290> stages<00:02:45.590> and<00:02:45.800> they<00:02:46.010> do<00:02:46.070> 10<00:02:46.460> sprints

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
the early stages and they do 10 sprints

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.920 
the early stages and they do 10 sprints
all<00:02:47.210> together<00:02:47.360> I<00:02:48.340> might<00:02:49.340> only<00:02:49.430> need<00:02:49.930> 30

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
all together I might only need 30

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.740 
all together I might only need 30
seconds<00:02:51.350> recovery<00:02:51.770> on<00:02:51.860> this<00:02:51.980> one<00:02:52.540> after<00:02:53.540> four

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
seconds recovery on this one after four

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.020 
seconds recovery on this one after four
or<00:02:53.780> five<00:02:53.890> I'm<00:02:54.890> only<00:02:55.100> two<00:02:55.400> minutes<00:02:55.580> two<00:02:55.880> and<00:02:56.000> a

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
or five I'm only two minutes two and a

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.210 
or five I'm only two minutes two and a
half<00:02:56.150> minutes<00:02:56.480> to<00:02:56.540> allow<00:02:56.720> my<00:02:56.870> heart<00:02:57.170> rate<00:02:57.380> and

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
half minutes to allow my heart rate and

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.240 
half minutes to allow my heart rate and
my<00:02:58.340> breathing<00:02:58.550> padded<00:02:59.030> to<00:02:59.690> come<00:02:59.870> back<00:03:00.020> down

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
my breathing padded to come back down

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.560 
my breathing padded to come back down
this<00:03:01.250> is<00:03:01.400> where<00:03:01.580> it<00:03:01.670> really<00:03:01.850> starts<00:03:02.210> to<00:03:02.270> spike

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
this is where it really starts to spike

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.280 
this is where it really starts to spike
that<00:03:02.980> metabolic<00:03:03.980> rate<00:03:04.750> okay<00:03:05.780> pretty<00:03:06.200> much

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
that metabolic rate okay pretty much

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.410 
that metabolic rate okay pretty much
recover<00:03:06.710> now<00:03:06.920> I<00:03:07.130> can<00:03:07.340> hold<00:03:07.550> a<00:03:07.610> conversation<00:03:07.820> I

can tell my heart rates gone a little
high<00:03:40.190> on<00:03:40.220> that<00:03:40.550> one<00:03:40.780> I'm<00:03:41.780> going<00:03:41.959> to<00:03:42.160> set

sitting out of ten you'll bit longer up

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.440 
sitting out of ten you'll bit longer up
for<00:03:46.640> recovery<00:03:47.030> now

on an equal time for recovery you're
going<00:04:00.020> to<00:04:00.080> see<00:04:00.310> those<00:04:01.310> final<00:04:02.050> five<00:04:03.050> or<00:04:03.260> six

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
going to see those final five or six

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.590 
going to see those final five or six

as hard you haven't recovered well
enough<00:04:08.500> I've<00:04:09.500> got<00:04:09.560> the<00:04:09.770> oxygen<00:04:10.190> back<00:04:10.370> in

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660

an<00:04:14.630> okay<00:04:14.930> way<00:04:15.080> to<00:04:15.140> do<00:04:15.350> it<00:04:15.440> but<00:04:15.620> I've<00:04:15.710> just<00:04:15.740> found

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 
an okay way to do it but I've just found

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.520 
an okay way to do it but I've just found
better<00:04:16.280> results<00:04:16.700> by<00:04:17.450> allowing<00:04:17.690> more<00:04:18.019> recovery

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
better results by allowing more recovery

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:21.970 
better results by allowing more recovery

cardio now when it comes to China I
typically<00:04:40.520> favor<00:04:40.730> doing<00:04:41.000> my<00:04:41.120> cardio<00:04:41.300> early
