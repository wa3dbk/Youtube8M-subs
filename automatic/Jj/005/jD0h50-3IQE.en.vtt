00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
our fixed line connection out land

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.340 
our fixed line connection out land
connection<00:00:59.730> it's<00:01:00.449> about<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.719> hundred<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.320> one

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
connection it's about a hundred to one

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.359 
connection it's about a hundred to one
hundred<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:01.800> ten<00:01:02.100> maximum<00:01:02.910> so<00:01:03.270> so<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.559> Galaxy

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
hundred and ten maximum so so the Galaxy

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.880 
hundred and ten maximum so so the Galaxy
s5<00:01:06.060> is<00:01:06.090> getting<00:01:06.600> pretty<00:01:06.840> close<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.470> what<00:01:07.860> our

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
s5 is getting pretty close to what our

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.539 
s5 is getting pretty close to what our
LAN<00:01:08.760> cable<00:01:09.299> connection<00:01:09.960> will<00:01:10.080> get<00:01:10.260> us<00:01:10.490> so<00:01:11.490> I'm

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
LAN cable connection will get us so I'm

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.670 
LAN cable connection will get us so I'm
just<00:01:11.640> gonna<00:01:11.729> run<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.270> couple<00:01:12.720> of<00:01:12.900> live<00:01:13.170> tests

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
just gonna run a couple of live tests

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:26.399 
just gonna run a couple of live tests
for<00:01:14.040> you<00:01:14.130> so<00:01:14.729> firstly<00:01:15.090> galaxy<00:01:15.780> s5<00:01:16.680> by<00:01:17.100> itself

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:28.260 

so<00:01:26.890> you<00:01:26.979> can<00:01:27.070> see<00:01:27.219> it<00:01:27.310> jumps<00:01:27.700> straight<00:01:28.090> up

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
so you can see it jumps straight up

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.870 
so you can see it jumps straight up
there's<00:01:28.659> no<00:01:28.840> lag<00:01:29.320> it<00:01:29.560> doesn't<00:01:29.890> build<00:01:30.130> up<00:01:30.369> so

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
there's no lag it doesn't build up so

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.080 
there's no lag it doesn't build up so
that<00:01:31.060> hit<00:01:31.270> 79<00:01:32.100> so<00:01:33.100> just<00:01:33.280> a<00:01:33.399> touch<00:01:33.640> under<00:01:33.969> the

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
that hit 79 so just a touch under the

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.620 
that hit 79 so just a touch under the
previous<00:01:34.539> one<00:01:34.720> and<00:01:35.140> then<00:01:35.590> the<00:01:35.680> upload<00:01:36.009> speech

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
previous one and then the upload speech

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.200 
previous one and then the upload speech
is<00:01:37.630> it<00:01:38.619> snowing<00:01:38.950> emulation<00:01:39.369> it<00:01:39.640> says<00:01:39.789> cable

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
is it snowing emulation it says cable

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.419 
is it snowing emulation it says cable

00:01:42.419 --> 00:01:42.429

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
bit restricted it's knowing they're on

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.179 
bit restricted it's knowing they're on
the<00:01:45.399> scale<00:01:45.670> with<00:01:45.789> the<00:01:45.939> download<00:01:46.179> but<00:01:46.899> that's

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
the scale with the download but that's

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.380 
the scale with the download but that's
expected<00:01:48.189> so<00:01:48.549> there's<00:01:48.729> more<00:01:48.970> from<00:01:49.270> our

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
expected so there's more from our

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.340 
expected so there's more from our

months who upload iPhone 5s on the same
connection<00:01:58.780> so<00:01:59.709> this<00:02:00.250> router<00:02:00.610> we're<00:02:00.939> running

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
connection so this router we're running

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.190 
connection so this router we're running
is<00:02:01.649> an<00:02:02.649> n<00:02:02.860> router<00:02:03.130> not<00:02:03.729> an<00:02:03.849> AC<00:02:04.060> lot<00:02:04.780> the<00:02:04.869> new<00:02:05.049> new

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
is an n router not an AC lot the new new

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.940 
is an n router not an AC lot the new new
super<00:02:05.590> speed<00:02:06.209> so<00:02:07.209> it's<00:02:07.420> just<00:02:07.569> max<00:02:07.869> of<00:02:08.080> 300

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
super speed so it's just max of 300

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.039 
super speed so it's just max of 300
megabits<00:02:09.250> per<00:02:09.369> second<00:02:09.849> there<00:02:10.599> you<00:02:10.690> can<00:02:10.840> see

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:11.049 
megabits per second there you can see

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:13.710 
megabits per second there you can see
consistently<00:02:11.830> the<00:02:12.160> iPhone<00:02:12.580> maxing<00:02:13.299> out<00:02:13.420> about

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
consistently the iPhone maxing out about

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.080 
consistently the iPhone maxing out about
45<00:02:14.230> megabits<00:02:14.650> per<00:02:14.769> second<00:02:15.250> as<00:02:15.730> on<00:02:16.000> the

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
45 megabits per second as on the

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.870 
45 megabits per second as on the
previous<00:02:16.510> test<00:02:17.069> so<00:02:18.069> this<00:02:18.190> is<00:02:18.370> one<00:02:18.549> off<00:02:18.700> to<00:02:18.849> the

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
previous test so this is one off to the

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.449 
previous test so this is one off to the
other<00:02:19.030> I'll<00:02:19.269> just<00:02:19.450> run<00:02:19.630> them<00:02:19.780> simultaneously

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
other I'll just run them simultaneously

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.729 
other I'll just run them simultaneously
and<00:02:21.459> to<00:02:21.640> see<00:02:21.819> you<00:02:21.880> can<00:02:22.030> see<00:02:22.060> that<00:02:22.560> it's<00:02:23.560> not

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
and to see you can see that it's not

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:27.630 
and to see you can see that it's not
necessarily<00:02:24.400> one<00:02:24.579> the<00:02:24.910> 15<00:02:25.269> the<00:02:25.420> other<00:02:25.920> and<00:02:26.920> so

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
necessarily one the 15 the other and so

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.550 
necessarily one the 15 the other and so
that<00:02:27.760> I<00:02:27.849> run<00:02:28.060> those<00:02:28.209> both<00:02:28.480> at<00:02:28.750> the<00:02:28.840> same<00:02:29.019> time

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.710 

so<00:02:42.830> you<00:02:43.550> can<00:02:43.700> see<00:02:43.880> when<00:02:44.060> they<00:02:44.180> ask<00:02:44.360> the<00:02:44.510> more

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
so you can see when they ask the more

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.540 
so you can see when they ask the more
time<00:02:44.930> yes<00:02:45.610> to<00:02:46.610> have<00:02:47.800> lower<00:02:48.800> speeds<00:02:49.220> but<00:02:49.459> the

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
time yes to have lower speeds but the

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.589 
time yes to have lower speeds but the
Galaxy<00:02:49.970> s5<00:02:50.239> has<00:02:50.270> stood<00:02:50.660> faster<00:02:51.260> and<00:02:51.920> I'll<00:02:52.099> just

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:52.599 
Galaxy s5 has stood faster and I'll just

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:55.930 
Galaxy s5 has stood faster and I'll just
activate<00:02:53.599> them<00:02:53.870> and<00:02:53.959> reverse<00:02:54.530> again<00:02:54.940> after

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
activate them and reverse again after

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:02.559 
activate them and reverse again after
this<00:02:56.090> it's<00:02:56.720> finished<00:03:00.459> and<00:03:01.459> this<00:03:01.910> case<00:03:02.330> the

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:02.569 
this it's finished and this case the

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:07.150 
this it's finished and this case the
upload<00:03:04.239> was<00:03:05.239> just<00:03:05.510> only<00:03:06.080> marginally<00:03:06.950> higher

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
upload was just only marginally higher

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.410 
upload was just only marginally higher
on<00:03:07.310> Galaxy<00:03:07.760> s5

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
on Galaxy s5

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.150 
on Galaxy s5
it's<00:03:08.690> gonna<00:03:08.840> start<00:03:09.260> them<00:03:09.470> in<00:03:09.769> reverse<00:03:10.640> order

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
it's gonna start them in reverse order

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.850 
it's gonna start them in reverse order
just<00:03:13.160> to<00:03:13.489> try<00:03:13.700> and<00:03:13.730> be<00:03:13.880> a<00:03:13.910> bit<00:03:14.060> more<00:03:14.239> scientific

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.559 

so<00:03:18.860> you<00:03:18.950> can<00:03:19.040> to<00:03:19.130> see<00:03:19.190> how<00:03:19.459> much<00:03:19.610> the<00:03:19.819> galaxy<00:03:20.269> s5

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:20.569 
so you can to see how much the galaxy s5

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:26.350 
so you can to see how much the galaxy s5
jumps<00:03:21.170> up<00:03:22.299> so<00:03:23.299> currently<00:03:24.700> 5<00:03:25.700> yes<00:03:25.910> right<00:03:26.150> at<00:03:26.299> the

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
jumps up so currently 5 yes right at the

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.600 
jumps up so currently 5 yes right at the
same<00:03:26.540> time<00:03:26.870> that's<00:03:27.680> getting<00:03:27.950> under<00:03:28.190> half<00:03:28.400> the

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
same time that's getting under half the

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:36.759 
same time that's getting under half the
speech<00:03:32.590> so<00:03:33.590> the<00:03:33.620> Galaxy<00:03:33.860> s5<00:03:34.489> is<00:03:34.819> AC<00:03:35.769> wireless

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
speech so the Galaxy s5 is AC wireless

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:39.610 
speech so the Galaxy s5 is AC wireless
AC<00:03:36.950> capable<00:03:37.670> but<00:03:37.970> our<00:03:38.239> modem<00:03:38.780> is<00:03:39.200> not<00:03:39.380> running

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
AC capable but our modem is not running

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.580 
AC capable but our modem is not running
that<00:03:39.860> speech<00:03:40.810> is<00:03:41.810> not<00:03:42.170> running<00:03:42.380> any

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
that speech is not running any

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.650 
that speech is not running any
technology<00:03:43.220> so<00:03:43.519> wouldn't<00:03:44.090> be<00:03:44.150> connecting

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
technology so wouldn't be connecting

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.190 
technology so wouldn't be connecting
that<00:03:45.410> faster<00:03:45.920> one<00:03:46.540> but<00:03:47.540> just<00:03:47.720> interesting<00:03:48.170> to

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
that faster one but just interesting to

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.289 
that faster one but just interesting to
see<00:03:48.739> put<00:03:49.310> them<00:03:49.459> side-by-side

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:50.299 
see put them side-by-side

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:56.199 
see put them side-by-side
I<00:03:50.660> just<00:03:51.290> did<00:03:51.470> one<00:03:51.620> more<00:03:51.890> single<00:03:52.540> test<00:03:55.120> just<00:03:56.120> to

I just did one more single test just to
see<00:03:58.329> the<00:03:59.329> fastest<00:03:59.989> currently<00:04:00.680> from<00:04:00.859> Apple<00:04:01.190> yes

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030
