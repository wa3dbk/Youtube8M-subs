00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.340 
start with to see how you're going and
then<00:03:16.760> incorporate<00:03:17.630> that<00:03:17.780> into<00:03:17.960> your<00:03:18.110> program

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
then incorporate that into your program

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.080 
then incorporate that into your program
so<00:03:18.650> you<00:03:18.680> might<00:03:18.950> instead<00:03:19.760> of<00:03:19.880> doing<00:03:20.060> your

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
so you might instead of doing your

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:21.610 
so you might instead of doing your
traditional<00:03:20.510> cardiovascular<00:03:21.230> training<00:03:21.320> you

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
traditional cardiovascular training you

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.080 
traditional cardiovascular training you
might<00:03:21.770> incorporate<00:03:21.980> this<00:03:22.370> so<00:03:22.580> the<00:03:22.700> first<00:03:22.910> time

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
might incorporate this so the first time

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.060 
might incorporate this so the first time
you<00:03:23.150> do<00:03:23.360> it<00:03:23.390> you<00:03:23.900> might<00:03:23.930> do<00:03:24.230> 10<00:03:24.440> reps<00:03:24.680> have<00:03:24.800> 30

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
you do it you might do 10 reps have 30

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:26.890 
you do it you might do 10 reps have 30
seconds<00:03:25.520> rest<00:03:25.700> and<00:03:25.940> you<00:03:26.240> probably<00:03:26.480> do<00:03:26.750> that

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
seconds rest and you probably do that

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.900 
seconds rest and you probably do that
three<00:03:27.110> or<00:03:27.230> four<00:03:27.380> times<00:03:27.560> through<00:03:27.920> once<00:03:28.640> you<00:03:28.790> get

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
three or four times through once you get

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.030 
three or four times through once you get
fitter<00:03:29.180> and<00:03:29.270> fitter<00:03:29.420> as<00:03:29.720> the<00:03:29.840> weeks<00:03:30.020> go<00:03:30.140> by<00:03:30.260> you

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
fitter and fitter as the weeks go by you

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.700 
fitter and fitter as the weeks go by you
may<00:03:31.220> do<00:03:31.280> more<00:03:32.240> combinations<00:03:32.960> or<00:03:33.080> more<00:03:33.290> punches

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:33.710 
may do more combinations or more punches

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:36.340 
may do more combinations or more punches
or<00:03:33.980> more<00:03:34.280> spoils<00:03:35.000> on<00:03:35.150> the<00:03:35.240> floor<00:03:35.480> or<00:03:35.720> you<00:03:36.170> might

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
or more spoils on the floor or you might

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.860 
or more spoils on the floor or you might
just<00:03:36.410> to<00:03:36.740> decide<00:03:37.040> to<00:03:37.250> add<00:03:37.400> more<00:03:37.640> add<00:03:37.910> more<00:03:38.480> reps

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
just to decide to add more add more reps

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.560 
just to decide to add more add more reps
okay<00:03:39.380> so<00:03:39.440> instead<00:03:39.740> of<00:03:39.830> doing<00:03:39.920> 10<00:03:40.250> you<00:03:40.730> do<00:03:40.850> 12<00:03:41.090> 15

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
okay so instead of doing 10 you do 12 15

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.110 
okay so instead of doing 10 you do 12 15
20<00:03:41.960> and<00:03:42.200> you<00:03:42.500> may<00:03:42.620> even<00:03:42.740> do<00:03:42.950> 25<00:03:43.430> through<00:03:43.760> it

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
20 and you may even do 25 through it

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.370 
20 and you may even do 25 through it
just<00:03:44.270> depends<00:03:44.570> on<00:03:44.630> what<00:03:44.780> how<00:03:44.900> you<00:03:44.930> want<00:03:45.200> to<00:03:45.290> do

just depends on what how you want to do

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.430 
just depends on what how you want to do
