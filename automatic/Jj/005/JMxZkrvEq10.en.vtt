00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:07.529
 y beauty is so making this video for 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.059
 show the operation of this pump 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.719
 aquarium 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.719
 and the bomb 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:28.380
 hb or 300 2.5 watts 240 volts is 220 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.560
 liters per hour is then as I do not 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.059
 I found no video about this 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.940
 from this pump or showing 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.890
 explaining everything so I 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.079
 I decided to make this video, no, no. 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.180
 I work with aquarium in the month with this but 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:46.320
 I bought the pump just to make a 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:49.739
 experience and as it is, you do not 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.170
 nothing about her on the internet 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.149
 so I decided to make this video 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.510
 taking advantage of this opportunity 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.100
 then it is the pump model hp or 300 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.699
 220 volts 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.519
 she moves 220 liters per hour with 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.890
 a five-centimeter column of 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.880
 height and the operation is as follows 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:14.610
 she can be submerged in the water she has 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:19.680
 these suction cups here that allow it 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:21.570
 glue on the glass of the aquarium and this 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.740
 allows it not to fall away from it 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:30.869
 always firm in place only then happens 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:37.049
 the next is this black part here is the 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:42.060
 part where the part that sucks water stays 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:45.390
 even that gray part that this part 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.000
 It is where the whole nucleus goes. 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.460
 electricity inside it is the one that stays 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.420
 and I'm going to open it here for you to see how 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.780
 and that is 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.670
 the operation of the one open to 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.240
 Let her call soon, just so you can see. 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.240
 What 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:09.920
 He's listening to her noise. 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:14.450
 But her noise is here. 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:18.760
 a little key you change here you change 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:22.370
 the amount of water that it will play 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.080
 A little while I'll do is the video 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:30.770
 showing how it works in water 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:31.640
 Ok, then I'll open it for you to see how 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:38.080
 and that is 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:45.130
 from the top of it from here onwards 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:48.370
 which opens and closes the water that also comes out 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:59.540
 This part here also comes out 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:03:01.370
 then look around this here that they pa 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.190
 they said that it moves to the water 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:09.019
 It's okay to leave here how it works. 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:13.760
 simple even ready 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:17.900
 Look there then inside but only in there. 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:20.720
 has this iron number six in the middle and is 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:23.299
 All truth is just a hole with this one. 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:26.959
 through the axis of the base is here in this 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:30.170
 the bottom of the shaft and here that gray part is 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:33.350
 all this only has that hole here that 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:36.920
 is also forbidden inside and here 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:40.640
 works like a solenoid a wires there 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:45.470
 inside and enough energy which is alternated 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:48.920
 and make creates an electromagnetic field 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:55.780
 easy and sima that will go this is a magnet 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:58.010
 a little black is attached to that is the 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:02.989
 turns on 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:05.239
 it works now on taf head connects 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:07.959
 she is doing nothing 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:19.070
 now if I put 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:24.639
 here I then this is how it works is 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:28.130
 like a scoop of ice cream also understood 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:30.800
 I'm going to take a break in the video, I'm going 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:32.360
 ride the pump pause the video I'll 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.470
 show you how it works 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.470
 her in the water
