camera made by IKEA the card would

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.119 
camera made by IKEA the card would
actually<00:00:13.450> on<00:00:13.570> it<00:00:13.660> is<00:00:13.749> rather<00:00:13.959> rather<00:00:14.829> nice

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:15.129 
actually on it is rather rather nice

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:16.830 
actually on it is rather rather nice
it's<00:00:15.490> not<00:00:15.730> flimsy<00:00:16.119> like<00:00:16.390> corrugated

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:16.840 
it's not flimsy like corrugated

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.990 
it's not flimsy like corrugated
cardboard<00:00:17.050> it's<00:00:17.710> actually<00:00:17.980> got<00:00:18.130> some<00:00:18.400> density

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:19.000 
cardboard it's actually got some density

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.100 
cardboard it's actually got some density
to<00:00:19.150> it<00:00:19.180> and<00:00:19.770> feels<00:00:20.770> rather<00:00:21.280> sturdy<00:00:22.270> so<00:00:22.990> it's

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:23.110 
to it and feels rather sturdy so it's

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.170 
to it and feels rather sturdy so it's
not<00:00:23.290> going<00:00:23.650> to<00:00:23.800> fall<00:00:24.160> apart<00:00:24.250> like<00:00:24.520> I<00:00:24.790> kind<00:00:25.090> of

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:25.180 
not going to fall apart like I kind of

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.380

anticipated now you can see there is the

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.120 
anticipated now you can see there is the
lens<00:00:28.870> and<00:00:29.170> actually<00:00:29.470> that's<00:00:29.620> probably<00:00:29.830> the

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.130 
lens and actually that's probably the

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.830

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
graphics very IKEA like you have two

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.930 
graphics very IKEA like you have two
plastic<00:00:44.079> nuts<00:00:44.769> and<00:00:44.980> bolts<00:00:45.249> holding<00:00:45.640> it<00:00:45.789> all

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
plastic nuts and bolts holding it all

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.779 
plastic nuts and bolts holding it all
kind<00:00:46.629> of<00:00:46.690> sandwiched<00:00:47.170> together<00:00:47.409> and<00:00:47.980> so<00:00:48.640> we

00:00:48.779 --> 00:00:48.789 
kind of sandwiched together and so we

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:50.340 
kind of sandwiched together and so we
are<00:00:48.969> going<00:00:49.149> to<00:00:49.300> put<00:00:49.480> the<00:00:49.659> batteries<00:00:49.989> in<00:00:50.199> it

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
are going to put the batteries in it

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.410 
are going to put the batteries in it
right<00:00:50.499> now<00:00:50.559> and<00:00:51.159> to<00:00:51.309> do<00:00:51.460> that<00:00:51.640> you<00:00:52.329> actually

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
right now and to do that you actually

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.569 
right now and to do that you actually
just<00:00:52.780> undo<00:00:53.199> these<00:00:53.379> bolts<00:00:53.769> on<00:00:53.920> the<00:00:54.010> back<00:00:54.159> very

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:54.579 
just undo these bolts on the back very

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:57.930 
just undo these bolts on the back very
easy<00:00:55.769> because<00:00:56.769> they're<00:00:56.949> plastic<00:00:57.370> I<00:00:57.579> would

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
easy because they're plastic I would

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.779 
easy because they're plastic I would
actually<00:00:58.089> recommend<00:00:58.920> just<00:00:59.920> using<00:01:00.010> your<00:01:00.399> hands

00:01:00.779 --> 00:01:00.789 
actually recommend just using your hands

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:04.319 
actually recommend just using your hands
there's<00:01:01.329> no<00:01:01.539> need<00:01:01.870> really<00:01:01.899> to<00:01:02.559> use<00:01:03.460> an<00:01:04.059> actual

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:04.329 
there's no need really to use an actual

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:07.920 
there's no need really to use an actual
screwdriver<00:01:04.899> and<00:01:05.199> you<00:01:06.100> actually<00:01:06.689> have<00:01:07.689> quite

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
screwdriver and you actually have quite

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.010 
screwdriver and you actually have quite
a<00:01:08.020> good<00:01:08.500> chance<00:01:08.799> of<00:01:09.070> messing<00:01:09.969> something<00:01:10.450> up<00:01:10.810> if

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
a good chance of messing something up if

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.870 
a good chance of messing something up if
you<00:01:11.140> do<00:01:11.380> and<00:01:11.979> since<00:01:12.130> these<00:01:12.280> come<00:01:12.549> out<00:01:12.640> so

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
you do and since these come out so

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.330 
you do and since these come out so
easily<00:01:13.170> it's<00:01:14.170> really<00:01:14.680> really<00:01:14.979> not<00:01:15.070> a<00:01:15.130> big

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
easily it's really really not a big

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:21.539 
easily it's really really not a big
problem<00:01:15.659> just<00:01:16.659> do<00:01:17.380> that<00:01:17.590> one<00:01:17.799> there<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:21.250> kind

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:21.549 
problem just do that one there the kind

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:22.889 
problem just do that one there the kind
of<00:01:21.670> push<00:01:21.850> out<00:01:22.030> they<00:01:22.210> kind<00:01:22.360> of<00:01:22.479> have<00:01:22.600> to<00:01:22.689> twist

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:22.899 
of push out they kind of have to twist

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:24.959 
of push out they kind of have to twist
out<00:01:23.049> and<00:01:23.320> push<00:01:23.469> out<00:01:23.619> a<00:01:23.649> little<00:01:23.680> bit<00:01:23.920> easier<00:01:24.159> so

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:24.969 
out and push out a little bit easier so

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:26.190 
out and push out a little bit easier so
to<00:01:25.030> put<00:01:25.420> the<00:01:25.479> batteries<00:01:25.750> in<00:01:25.810> you<00:01:26.079> actually

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
to put the batteries in you actually

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.810 
to put the batteries in you actually
have<00:01:26.409> to<00:01:26.500> take<00:01:26.680> the<00:01:27.009> front<00:01:27.219> of<00:01:27.280> the<00:01:27.369> camera<00:01:27.549> off

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
have to take the front of the camera off

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.399 
have to take the front of the camera off
and<00:01:28.560> there<00:01:29.560> you<00:01:29.680> can<00:01:29.829> see<00:01:30.159> how<00:01:31.060> it's<00:01:31.409> I'm

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:32.409 
and there you can see how it's I'm

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:34.649 
and there you can see how it's I'm
actually<00:01:32.670> taped<00:01:33.670> I<00:01:33.939> thought<00:01:34.180> it<00:01:34.299> was<00:01:34.420> three

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659 
actually taped I thought it was three

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:35.910 
actually taped I thought it was three
separate<00:01:34.960> pieces<00:01:35.109> but<00:01:35.409> it<00:01:35.530> actually<00:01:35.680> does

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
separate pieces but it actually does

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.429 
separate pieces but it actually does
appear<00:01:36.159> to<00:01:36.189> be<00:01:36.390> taped<00:01:37.390> of<00:01:37.630> some<00:01:37.869> using<00:01:38.289> some

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:38.439 
appear to be taped of some using some

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:42.179 
appear to be taped of some using some
sort<00:01:38.590> of<00:01:38.649> tape<00:01:38.890> to<00:01:39.159> hold<00:01:39.759> the<00:01:39.969> cardboard<00:01:41.189> onto

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:42.189 
sort of tape to hold the cardboard onto

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:45.389 
sort of tape to hold the cardboard onto
the<00:01:43.179> camera<00:01:44.079> itself<00:01:44.530> right<00:01:44.829> there<00:01:45.070> there's

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 
the camera itself right there there's

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:47.849 
the camera itself right there there's
piece<00:01:45.670> of<00:01:45.820> black<00:01:46.060> tape<00:01:46.229> camera<00:01:47.229> and<00:01:47.409> then<00:01:47.770> the

piece of black tape camera and then the

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:49.590 
piece of black tape camera and then the
cardboard<00:01:48.250> wraps<00:01:48.429> around<00:01:48.640> it<00:01:48.939> to<00:01:49.149> keep<00:01:49.329> it<00:01:49.450> all

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
cardboard wraps around it to keep it all

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.929

together and then the front of it as

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:54.959 
together and then the front of it as
well<00:01:52.179> is<00:01:53.140> actually<00:01:53.289> covered<00:01:53.770> probably<00:01:54.520> just

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:54.969 
well is actually covered probably just

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:57.230 
well is actually covered probably just
so<00:01:55.060> that<00:01:55.210> you<00:01:55.299> don't<00:01:55.329> muck<00:01:56.229> up<00:01:56.409> any<00:01:56.649> of<00:01:56.770> the

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
rather easily I'm actually going to do

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:20.110 
rather easily I'm actually going to do
first<00:02:15.400> push<00:02:16.400> that<00:02:16.640> one<00:02:16.790> in<00:02:17.030> ooh<00:02:18.370> yeah<00:02:19.370> okay

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
first push that one in ooh yeah okay

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.940 
first push that one in ooh yeah okay
there<00:02:20.450> we<00:02:20.569> go<00:02:20.599> and<00:02:20.959> then<00:02:21.260> they<00:02:21.379> sit<00:02:21.439> rather

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
there we go and then they sit rather

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.140 
there we go and then they sit rather
well<00:02:22.299> yeah<00:02:23.379> sort<00:02:24.379> of<00:02:24.640> they<00:02:25.640> do<00:02:25.700> have<00:02:25.909> some

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
well yeah sort of they do have some

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.240 
well yeah sort of they do have some
spring<00:02:26.420> to<00:02:26.599> them<00:02:26.689> which<00:02:26.900> is<00:02:27.230> why<00:02:27.799> you<00:02:27.860> have<00:02:28.129> to

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
spring to them which is why you have to

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.880 
spring to them which is why you have to
put<00:02:28.430> the<00:02:28.610> cover<00:02:29.030> back<00:02:29.299> on<00:02:29.569> and<00:02:29.930> then<00:02:30.709> just

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
put the cover back on and then just

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.160 
put the cover back on and then just
again<00:02:31.930> slide<00:02:32.930> these<00:02:33.079> bolts<00:02:33.379> through<00:02:35.170> pretty

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
again slide these bolts through pretty

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.800 
again slide these bolts through pretty
simple<00:02:36.650> do<00:02:37.579> it<00:02:37.730> by<00:02:37.849> hand<00:02:38.269> because<00:02:38.540> they<00:02:38.659> don't

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
simple do it by hand because they don't

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.660 
simple do it by hand because they don't
need<00:02:38.930> to<00:02:39.019> be<00:02:39.109> overly<00:02:39.409> tight<00:02:39.739> you<00:02:40.400> don't<00:02:40.549> want

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
need to be overly tight you don't want

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:41.740 
need to be overly tight you don't want
to<00:02:40.730> tighten<00:02:41.060> them<00:02:41.150> too<00:02:41.359> much<00:02:41.510> and

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
to tighten them too much and

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.899 
to tighten them too much and
accidentally<00:02:42.170> break<00:02:42.409> something<00:02:42.790> because<00:02:43.790> of

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:43.909 
accidentally break something because of

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:45.190 
accidentally break something because of
the<00:02:44.000> camera<00:02:44.329> although<00:02:44.629> the<00:02:44.780> cardboard<00:02:45.140> is

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
the camera although the cardboard is

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.899 
the camera although the cardboard is
decently<00:02:45.530> thick<00:02:45.799> and<00:02:45.980> so<00:02:46.129> is<00:02:46.250> the<00:02:46.370> silicone

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:46.909 
decently thick and so is the silicone

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:49.720 
decently thick and so is the silicone
that<00:02:47.540> makes<00:02:48.170> up<00:02:48.349> the<00:02:48.440> camera<00:02:48.769> itself<00:02:49.129> I<00:02:49.459> would

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
that makes up the camera itself I would

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.670 
that makes up the camera itself I would
just<00:02:49.879> recommend<00:02:50.060> since<00:02:50.510> these<00:02:50.599> are<00:02:50.900> pretty

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
just recommend since these are pretty

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.550 
just recommend since these are pretty
limited<00:02:51.920> and<00:02:52.190> kind<00:02:52.639> of<00:02:52.730> rare<00:02:53.030> to<00:02:53.299> not<00:02:54.139> really

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
limited and kind of rare to not really

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.750 
limited and kind of rare to not really
mess<00:02:54.739> with<00:02:54.769> it<00:02:55.069> too<00:02:55.280> much<00:02:55.310> just<00:02:57.430> put<00:02:58.430> the<00:02:58.579> bolt

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
mess with it too much just put the bolt

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.479 
mess with it too much just put the bolt
on<00:02:58.940> give<00:02:59.359> it<00:02:59.389> a<00:02:59.480> little<00:02:59.650> tightness<00:03:03.220> and<00:03:04.220> there

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
on give it a little tightness and there

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:07.509 
on give it a little tightness and there
you<00:03:04.579> go<00:03:04.700> that<00:03:05.090> is<00:03:05.120> how<00:03:05.920> to<00:03:06.920> put<00:03:07.069> the<00:03:07.190> batteries

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
you go that is how to put the batteries

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:10.449 
you go that is how to put the batteries
