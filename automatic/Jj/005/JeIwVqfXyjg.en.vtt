00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:14.850
 That was delicious lamb and pork tenderloin 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.850
 from the smart profi markus take a look 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.669
 We start with the save because that's on 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:27.189
 longest takes a little piece 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:29.320
 meat always goes well on the program 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:31.809
 here need about for such a piece 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:35.430
 hour on the act can not break anything 

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:35.430
 just go better smoking 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.430
 Here we cut that what 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:42.290
 now here a bit outwardly that 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.920
 protect meat in it a bit 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.660
 away and we can do it a bit 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.140
 go down like one piece more 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:56.540
 cut like that and we do that now 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:59.960
 we can do it all around the meat 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:02.809
 let the already we lie on 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:07.630
 statement because we pack the meat 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.630
 completely in bacon carpet 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:17.550
 then we have yes we do not close 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.750
 a lot because it had very own 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:23.130
 taste was also that again 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.290
 So the simple is just better 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.500
 here so carefully under and once 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.720
 Raise welfare and then 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.729
 we almost get our piece ready 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.790
 who now fear makes here a 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.380
 sticker by that bacon behaves yes 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.060
 so it could actually hang up by 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.350
 the heat attracts aspect of the 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.380
 actually already the world then 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.380
 to exacerbate the costs, so to speak 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.020
 The lamb fillet is actually a lot 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.130
 heavy meat very tasty very tender 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.110
 many are still afraid of this 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.460
 It was not tragic today 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.040
 more here we are only going to cut both 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:00.580
 only the silver he cuts away so would 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.140
 already a piece of meat look is from 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.850
 All pages are beautiful now 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.680
 beautiful piece prepared 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.170
 that's how the others make me clear 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.060
 then we make a marinade 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.550
 liquid marina of the brand weight 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.070
 coriano cayenne pepper one 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.860
 knife tip that a half teaspoon 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:20.530
 sheep are fresh between big marin 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.090
 thyme the slides would be resp 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.100
 in addition to the knife back very easy and 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.940
 push this way over here until we 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.130
 we want to have about a half 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.510
 teaspoon full and had the but through 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.090
 first time we do this with the 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.610
 Rosemary also just like the firs 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.990
 so beautifully says decades also hook 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.630
 so that the essential oils are beautiful 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:41.830
 can set free says half 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:44.020
 lemon and four tablespoons here 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.870
 we now have the oil lemon 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:51.970
 oregano and a bit of thyme is what 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:54.340
 then a little rosmarie nations 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:58.600
 we have here as usual and said 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.470
 so far a bit depending on how 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.440
 sharp 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:05.080
 here a bit sharp mustard that 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:09.160
 we spoil all by hand and 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.739
 have thereby our marinade and there 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.970
 Let's put the meat in there now 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.290
 okay that's the standard now 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.420
 that looks an hour now and then 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:20.470
 We place the same with smoke and get 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:22.570
 the hour at the door did two hours each 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.130
 after use out if meat 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.950
 can only ever be better the length 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.200
 if we do not get it yet 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.959
 we need aluminum foil to pack it 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:35.010
 far away from the combustion chamber around the 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.010
 flavors in it 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.780
 he will come back here as well 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.520
 Chambers out 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.560
 so that it gets its taste with it 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.480
 the gift is pretty crispy and that 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.920
 meat is transformed and it is at roma 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.390
 into the meat with can leave 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.130
 We pack that a little further away 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.720
 here back here yes you are in the corner 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.340
 because they can be nice and slow 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.760
 always go through the thick end 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:59.180
 direction smoke chamber we lay now 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.180
 here 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.870
 Now we close the oven and let it go 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:08.299
 him at least a half 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:11.110
 hour to let tell 120 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:13.480
 Degree 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.400
 markus shows us what we have now 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.930
 that makes about 130 degrees in the smoker 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.209
 nothing plus minus a grade is always good 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.200
 that 's just the art that goes easy on 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.670
 large 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.570
 you can see the meat is a bit 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:27.160
 shrunk the heat came you can 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.020
 next to you can turn it when the bacon 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.240
 does not fall down, we now what I 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.370
 I told him I poked or just nice 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.430
 wrap it tight is that the taste 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.780
 we need and want and need to have 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:42.840
 fast times so you see how so 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:45.940
 something can look so yes you can see that 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.860
 and sees this route layer so what 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.380
 the pretty from outside has mettmann 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:53.230
 often and almost always a red layer 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:55.900
 the pure is like smoked mud 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:57.940
 is not dry now someone cuts 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.750
 23 pieces down so always try 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.290
 could 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.290
 but be 

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:07.559
 if you do not bother 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.320
 juicy continues 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.360
 22
