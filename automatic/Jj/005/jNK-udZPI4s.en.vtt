 kong jockey club here is my selection for 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.910
 this handicap I placed at the head number 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.560
 two a and fight for kisses that counts 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.970
 already three places in four attempts 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.810
 in the quintés 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.220
 I think he's able here to provide the 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.990
 winner of this race is to win 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.630
 his first event I will ask number 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.550
 1 or water that despite its top-weight me 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.460
 seems competitive a horse hard to 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.680
 the effort that will not be disturbed and by 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.940
 the soft ground no more than by the 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.219
 straight line he likes about 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.870
 rectilinear course the wall at 4t video 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.059
 shock attention to him he went well 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.010
 recently relaunched last month 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.750
 in a quinté over to gingham a 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.430
 performance that bears witness to salmon degree 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.239
 of form it is a beautiful outsider the number 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.410
 7 to know baba o'riley a raid of 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.539
 ducasse or more should be served 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.829
 Saturday the number 11 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:04.439
 alice and nora who is well and counts 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.489
 already good performances in the 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.630
 disabilities 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.130
 a third place and a second 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.770
 place to saint cloud in such a society 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.869
 What's the point of logic? 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.670
 supporters the number 12 in this 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:20.790
 competition is when you apricots who 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:23.460
 had done well and pretty well finished in 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.619
 a quinté last month what him 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.750
 also confers a chance judged on 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.400
 its performances 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.439
 then I'll hold back to place them 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.630
 for beautiful royal 6 number coast 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.329
 taken all in all fairly regular and the 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.270
 number 14 first to who seems to me 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.159
 also able to do well 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.659
 know that she faces, however, her 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.850
 seniors for the first time in his 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.590
 career is a filly of 3 years a 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.890
 summary figures for this city quinté 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.840
 is the 2 the 1 the 4 the 7 the count of 12 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.600
 and a little further on the 6 7 14 in case of 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.040
 non runners may be mentioned where the number 10 in 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.600
 yb who will be provided with blinkers for the 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.430
 first time following the program 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.960
 deauville in the first in the 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.079
 second part which thomas fourcy seems 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.280
 well represented that 206 bint and jakarta 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.420
 I had the opportunity to talk with 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.489
 professional friendly 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.319
 this is a 300 pulley he 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:13.019
 thinks a lot to gain easily 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.549
 last test it starts here on the 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:16.079
 Normandy coast with 2.13 solids 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:18.389
 claims the main opposition 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:19.799
 why not the 202 akloul that counts 

00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:23.280
 two second places in as many 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:24.689
 public outlets 206 202 in the 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.829
 next one again thomas fourcy 

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:31.200
 well represented 70 306 almou tarnaise a 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:34.150
 4 year old male who is estimated within 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.430
 priests who finds here the opportunity to 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.430
 and highlight yourself in a 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.840
 very good lot 306 and 206 for the 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.209
 protected by thomas fourcy in deauville 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.950
 in the price of skin mone group 2 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.579
 of the day the highlight of this meeting 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.090
 Deauville 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:51.640
 I will trust first and foremost 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.500
 fillets of 3 years the 709 savannah that has 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.720
 filled that ranked second in the price 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.730
 malleret a group ii disputed end of june 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.829
 also pay attention to the 708 charm kalla 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.629
 who had won the Cleopatra Award a 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:03.700
 cold group before placing 4th 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:05.560
 honorably the price of diane 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.260
 these two fillies of 3 years seems 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.569
 able to carve out the lion's share 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.859
 meeting pornichet 2 in the second I 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:13.690
 advise you the centquatre a big 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:15.250
 mold that certainly counts two 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.780
 disqualifications in as many outings 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.639
 trotting but it's a horse 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.109
 find here a lot within reach of 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:21.459
 adversaries to his measure the opportunity for 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:22.989
 him to highlight himself so much 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.639
 that he has already breached 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:27.310
 on this plot it must be enough 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:29.530
 409 ASBU is estimated in 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.639
 the stable of michel deniau the horse 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.019
 find here good conditions of 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:33.700
 race an opposition in his strings 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:36.760
 logically his place is on the podium 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.049
 the 409 blue I will ask him the 408 to 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.400
 know germany 1 which is worth a lot 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:40.000
 better than his last say 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.709
 raw rankings 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.389
 Patrick Martin Finally, I'm talking about the future 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:48.400
 409 408 the 510 virtual haufor seeks a 

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:50.049
 third consecutive win he has to 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.540
 priori means if judged by its 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:54.190
 last two hits the 708 late at 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.199
 homework we run with confidence 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.419
 délits planchenault is a mare in 

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:59.440
 full form currently thongs times 

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:00.790
 she was forced to negotiate the 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.090
 last bend in thickness with eric 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.739
 refined 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.000
 which did not stop him from well 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:06.879
 support his effort to rank 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.169
 third and stayed at best tackles 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:09.010
 a lot in his strings even though the start 

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:10.359
 is his weak point 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.769
 she should fight again 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:13.989
 for the first places I 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:14.979
 would associate it with the 701 soprin slips a 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.989
 choice that collects the good 

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:18.940
 Now showing 700 8 701 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.769
 finally to finish this meeting at 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.990
 pornichet meeting 2 I advise you 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.190

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.530

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.150
 only four outings on 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.070
 the pornichet racecourse an excellent 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.930
 ratio an excellent percentage of 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.190
 success know that he just proved 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.539
 her form and that she just proved her 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.139
 form by imposing on the program 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:36.879
 doha 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:38.560

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.659
 amateur affa effective she must be able 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.120

 the 103 lucky dragons who did very well 

00:04:56.379 --> 00:05:00.909
 started by ranking second and after 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.110
 to have finished well it was common June on 

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:03.370
 Longchamp Victory Orders 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.289
 is close to a first victory she 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.969
 little oppressive plamor the 202 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:08.650
 auvergnats certainly he did not run

 February date of a victory obtained at 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:15.310

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.870
 quality philippe pelletier is past 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.490
 master in the art of preparing well his 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.469
 horses for back to school and in this lot 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:22.000
 Auvergne should be able to fight for 

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:23.740
 success why not win because 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.310
 the opposition seems in his strings 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:29.319
 the 103 lady dragon and the 202 auvergnats 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:31.479
