going to turn them loose in this round
pin<00:00:10.500> here<00:00:10.770> it's<00:00:11.010> a<00:00:11.250> not<00:00:11.879> perfectly<00:00:12.240> round<00:00:12.330> and

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:12.959 
pin here it's a not perfectly round and

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:15.650 
pin here it's a not perfectly round and
it's<00:00:13.530> probably<00:00:14.219> equivalent<00:00:14.520> to<00:00:14.850> at<00:00:15.270> least<00:00:15.449> a

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
it's probably equivalent to at least a

it's probably equivalent to at least a
50<00:00:16.020> foot<00:00:16.170> round<00:00:16.379> pin<00:00:16.650> maybe<00:00:16.860> give<00:00:17.220> or<00:00:17.340> take<00:00:17.460> but

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
50 foot round pin maybe give or take but

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.269 
50 foot round pin maybe give or take but
we're<00:00:18.270> going<00:00:18.359> to<00:00:18.420> be<00:00:18.960> doing<00:00:19.109> on<00:00:19.440> the<00:00:19.680> hook<00:00:20.100> on

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:36.720 
following me around so we're gonna see

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.520 
following me around so we're gonna see
how<00:00:36.810> that<00:00:36.990> goes<00:00:38.600> this<00:00:39.600> is<00:00:39.750> just<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:40.020> form<00:00:40.320> of

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
how that goes this is just a form of

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.440 
how that goes this is just a form of
becoming<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.490> leader<00:00:42.650> and<00:00:43.880> we<00:00:44.880> can<00:00:45.030> achieve<00:00:45.120> it

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
becoming a leader and we can achieve it

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.020 
becoming a leader and we can achieve it
at<00:00:46.020> liberty<00:00:46.470> which<00:00:46.770> is<00:00:46.950> basically<00:00:47.490> nothing<00:00:47.700> on

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
at liberty which is basically nothing on

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.970 
at liberty which is basically nothing on
the<00:00:48.180> horse<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.570> then<00:00:49.230> it<00:00:49.380> really<00:00:49.710> makes

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
the horse and then it really makes

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.040 
the horse and then it really makes
leading<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.520> doing<00:00:50.730> groundwork<00:00:51.240> with<00:00:51.810> your
