00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
ordered the flooville c4 I hang on the

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.040 
ordered the flooville c4 I hang on the
back<00:00:15.179> powerful<00:00:16.109> Terr<00:00:16.289> on<00:00:17.160> Friday<00:00:17.699> and<00:00:18.029> it<00:00:18.750> came

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
right now and I just set it up and has

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.880 
right now and I just set it up and has
been<00:00:24.420> running<00:00:24.689> for<00:00:24.720> about<00:00:24.900> five<00:00:25.199> hours<00:00:25.230> or<00:00:25.680> so

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
been running for about five hours or so

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.849 
been running for about five hours or so
and<00:00:26.160> I'm<00:00:26.310> gonna<00:00:26.430> say<00:00:26.699> it<00:00:26.730> kicks<00:00:27.180> butt<00:00:27.510> if

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:27.859 
and I'm gonna say it kicks butt if

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:31.939 
and I'm gonna say it kicks butt if
because<00:00:28.859> I<00:00:29.220> reason<00:00:29.970> I<00:00:30.029> say<00:00:30.300> that<00:00:30.330> is<00:00:30.779> because<00:00:31.380> I

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
because I reason I say that is because I

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.690 
because I reason I say that is because I
got<00:00:32.489> new<00:00:32.669> driftwood<00:00:33.739> I've<00:00:34.739> had<00:00:35.309> it<00:00:35.430> for<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:35.579> long

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
got new driftwood I've had it for a long

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.280 
got new driftwood I've had it for a long
time<00:00:35.730> but<00:00:36.059> I<00:00:36.149> had<00:00:36.329> my<00:00:36.630> head<00:00:36.809> into<00:00:36.989> my<00:00:37.079> back<00:00:37.260> yard

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
time but I had my head into my back yard

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.200 
time but I had my head into my back yard
also<00:00:37.710> coming<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.129> put<00:00:38.280> this<00:00:38.370> my<00:00:38.550> tank<00:00:38.790> so<00:00:38.940> I<00:00:39.030> did

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
also coming to put this my tank so I did

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.720 
also coming to put this my tank so I did
this<00:00:39.690> really<00:00:39.989> long<00:00:40.170> so<00:00:40.410> I<00:00:40.500> put<00:00:40.739> up<00:00:40.829> high<00:00:41.520> that

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
this really long so I put up high that

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.490 
this really long so I put up high that
was<00:00:41.879> fake<00:00:42.210> put<00:00:42.540> it<00:00:42.690> with<00:00:42.780> plants<00:00:43.079> or<00:00:43.290> whatever

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
was fake put it with plants or whatever

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.190 
was fake put it with plants or whatever
so<00:00:43.620> they<00:00:43.649> look<00:00:43.860> so<00:00:44.010> cramped<00:00:44.570> but<00:00:45.570> anyway<00:00:46.050> I<00:00:46.079> was

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
so they look so cramped but anyway I was

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.139 
so they look so cramped but anyway I was
about<00:00:46.469> so<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:47.160> stirred<00:00:47.520> up<00:00:47.670> all<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.910> debris

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
about so it stirred up all the debris

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.360 
about so it stirred up all the debris
the<00:00:48.239> rocks<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:49.230> it<00:00:49.410> cleared<00:00:49.710> up<00:00:49.890> pretty<00:00:49.920> fast

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
the rocks and it cleared up pretty fast

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.250 
the rocks and it cleared up pretty fast
I<00:00:50.550> mean<00:00:50.700> sure<00:00:50.969> there's<00:00:51.210> still<00:00:51.420> some<00:00:51.600> stuff

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
I mean sure there's still some stuff

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.520 
I mean sure there's still some stuff
that's<00:00:52.770> party<00:00:53.550> right<00:00:54.000> there<00:00:54.030> but<00:00:54.390> she's<00:00:55.230> so

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
that's party right there but she's so

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.900 
that's party right there but she's so
pretty<00:00:55.739> good<00:00:55.949> I<00:00:55.980> mean<00:00:56.100> it<00:00:56.250> was<00:00:56.370> nasty<00:00:56.579> before

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
pretty good I mean it was nasty before

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.650 
pretty good I mean it was nasty before
but<00:00:57.300> yeah<00:00:58.550> so<00:00:59.550> I<00:00:59.579> just<00:00:59.879> wanted<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.120> do<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.210> little

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
but yeah so I just wanted to do a little

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.299 
but yeah so I just wanted to do a little
tiny<00:01:00.809> review<00:01:01.199> that<00:01:01.350> I<00:01:01.410> have<00:01:01.559> I'll<00:01:01.859> do<00:01:02.010> one<00:01:02.190> or

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
tiny review that I have I'll do one or

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.789 
tiny review that I have I'll do one or
more<00:01:02.460> in<00:01:02.579> depth<00:01:02.789> later<00:01:03.000> but<00:01:03.930> as<00:01:04.170> right<00:01:04.619> now<00:01:04.769> I

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
more in depth later but as right now I

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.590 
more in depth later but as right now I
just<00:01:05.070> want<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.460> show<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:05.670> guys<00:01:05.790> how<00:01:06.180> cool<00:01:06.240> it

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
just want to show you guys how cool it

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.429 
just want to show you guys how cool it
is<00:01:06.750> I<00:01:07.070> mean<00:01:08.070> it's<00:01:08.280> it's<00:01:09.060> pretty<00:01:09.240> cool<00:01:09.540> okay<00:01:10.409> so

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
is I mean it's it's pretty cool okay so

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.429 
is I mean it's it's pretty cool okay so
um<00:01:10.920> I'll<00:01:11.729> start<00:01:12.030> with<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.180> intake<00:01:12.479> tube<00:01:12.720> so<00:01:13.110> it

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
um I'll start with the intake tube so it

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.320 
um I'll start with the intake tube so it
has<00:01:13.590> adjustable<00:01:13.740> flow<00:01:14.310> right<00:01:14.549> so<00:01:14.939> that's<00:01:15.090> the

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
has adjustable flow right so that's the

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.289 
has adjustable flow right so that's the
minimal<00:01:15.750> minimal<00:01:16.740> flow<00:01:17.159> rate<00:01:17.369> which<00:01:17.640> is<00:01:17.970> I

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
minimal minimal flow rate which is I

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.550 
minimal minimal flow rate which is I
don't<00:01:18.540> know<00:01:18.600> why<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:18.810> would<00:01:18.960> warm<00:01:19.170> with<00:01:19.350> one

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
don't know why you would warm with one

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.630 
don't know why you would warm with one
but<00:01:20.150> anyway<00:01:21.150> so<00:01:21.630> that's<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:22.369> most<00:01:23.369> the

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
but anyway so that's the most the

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.520 
but anyway so that's the most the
maximum<00:01:24.119> flow<00:01:24.299> rate<00:01:24.330> you<00:01:24.540> get<00:01:24.810> as<00:01:25.049> you<00:01:25.170> can<00:01:25.290> see

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
maximum flow rate you get as you can see

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.469 
maximum flow rate you get as you can see
I<00:01:25.770> don't<00:01:26.460> know<00:01:26.610> if<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:26.820> saw<00:01:27.000> my<00:01:27.119> camera

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
I don't know if you saw my camera

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:35.630 
I don't know if you saw my camera
because<00:01:32.299> whatever<00:01:33.299> so<00:01:34.140> what<00:01:34.770> it<00:01:34.860> does<00:01:35.040> is<00:01:35.430> it

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
because whatever so what it does is it

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.670 
because whatever so what it does is it
sucks<00:01:35.820> with<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.030> water<00:01:36.210> intake<00:01:36.600> tube<00:01:36.840> comes

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
sucks with the water intake tube comes

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.980 
sucks with the water intake tube comes
back<00:01:37.860> here<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.189> mechanical<00:01:38.700> filtration

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
back here to mechanical filtration

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.140 
back here to mechanical filtration
filtration<00:01:39.990> pad<00:01:40.500> right<00:01:40.650> here<00:01:40.850> this<00:01:41.850> is<00:01:41.909> the

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
filtration pad right here this is the

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.240 
filtration pad right here this is the
coarse<00:01:42.390> side<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:43.229> then<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.439> goes<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:44.009> fine

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
coarse side and then it goes to the fine

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.520 
coarse side and then it goes to the fine
side<00:01:44.490> of<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.729> back<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.450> so<00:01:46.020> it's<00:01:46.229> really<00:01:46.380> easy

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
side of the back and so it's really easy

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.380 
side of the back and so it's really easy
to<00:01:46.770> change<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.430> you're<00:01:47.520> consuming<00:01:47.850> that<00:01:48.090> stop

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
to change to you're consuming that stop

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.940 
to change to you're consuming that stop
the<00:01:48.540> filter<00:01:48.840> take<00:01:49.079> it<00:01:49.200> out<00:01:49.290> it's<00:01:49.500> pretty<00:01:49.680> cool

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
the filter take it out it's pretty cool

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.149 
the filter take it out it's pretty cool
and<00:01:50.700> so<00:01:50.729> what<00:01:51.119> it<00:01:51.180> does<00:01:51.329> is<00:01:51.750> that<00:01:52.009> catches<00:01:53.009> all

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
and so what it does is that catches all

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.069 
and so what it does is that catches all
like<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.579> plant<00:01:53.850> material<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.630> stuff<00:01:54.960> like

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
like the plant material and stuff like

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.410 
like the plant material and stuff like
that<00:01:55.290> that<00:01:55.470> gets<00:01:55.649> caught<00:01:55.860> with<00:01:56.240> aluminum<00:01:57.240> and

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
that that gets caught with aluminum and

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.700 
that that gets caught with aluminum and
then<00:01:58.229> it<00:01:59.219> goes<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.790> chemical<00:02:00.710> chemical

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
then it goes to the chemical chemical

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.289 
then it goes to the chemical chemical
side<00:02:02.189> which<00:02:02.399> is<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:03.890> filter<00:02:04.890> carbon<00:02:05.250> so<00:02:05.520> uh<00:02:05.549> my

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
side which is the filter carbon so uh my

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.430 
side which is the filter carbon so uh my
beautiful<00:02:07.049> crown<00:02:07.259> I<00:02:07.439> really<00:02:07.680> like<00:02:07.860> carbon

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
beautiful crown I really like carbon

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.109 
beautiful crown I really like carbon
but<00:02:08.560> I'm<00:02:09.220> just<00:02:09.280> gonna<00:02:09.490> try<00:02:09.550> it<00:02:09.729> because<00:02:09.910> I<00:02:10.090> just

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
but I'm just gonna try it because I just

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.000 
but I'm just gonna try it because I just
got<00:02:10.360> it<00:02:10.570> but<00:02:10.840> if<00:02:11.260> I<00:02:11.380> don't<00:02:11.440> like<00:02:11.650> it<00:02:11.680> I'm<00:02:11.890> going

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
got it but if I don't like it I'm going

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.970 
got it but if I don't like it I'm going
to<00:02:12.070> take<00:02:12.160> it<00:02:12.280> out<00:02:12.400> and<00:02:12.520> put<00:02:12.820> these<00:02:13.000> fireballs

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
to take it out and put these fireballs

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.170 
to take it out and put these fireballs
because<00:02:14.980> this<00:02:15.160> were<00:02:15.310> biological<00:02:15.970> filtration

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
because this were biological filtration

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.990 
because this were biological filtration
I<00:02:16.660> mean<00:02:16.840> this<00:02:17.440> trickle<00:02:18.100> of<00:02:18.190> system<00:02:18.670> that<00:02:18.790> has

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
I mean this trickle of system that has

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.870 
I mean this trickle of system that has
been<00:02:19.240> yourself<00:02:20.460> it's<00:02:21.460> pretty<00:02:21.670> darn<00:02:21.850> cool<00:02:22.090> I

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
been yourself it's pretty darn cool I

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.630 
been yourself it's pretty darn cool I
just<00:02:24.880> think<00:02:25.240> it's<00:02:25.510> just<00:02:25.860> really<00:02:26.860> cool<00:02:27.100> it's

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
just think it's just really cool it's

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.970 
just think it's just really cool it's
the<00:02:27.700> first<00:02:27.940> wet<00:02:28.120> dry<00:02:28.330> filter<00:02:28.600> that<00:02:29.470> it's<00:02:29.680> that

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
the first wet dry filter that it's that

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.330 
the first wet dry filter that it's that
it's<00:02:30.130> not<00:02:30.220> a<00:02:31.530> it's<00:02:32.530> not<00:02:32.620> a<00:02:32.710> powerful<00:02:33.040> thing

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
it's not a it's not a powerful thing

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.830 
it's not a it's not a powerful thing
just<00:02:33.670> blew<00:02:33.820> me<00:02:34.000> away<00:02:34.030> that's<00:02:34.270> why<00:02:34.450> I<00:02:34.480> bought<00:02:34.720> it

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
just blew me away that's why I bought it

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.360 
just blew me away that's why I bought it
the<00:02:34.900> first<00:02:34.930> place<00:02:35.380> to<00:02:35.530> be<00:02:35.560> it's<00:02:35.800> just<00:02:36.010> it's

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
the first place to be it's just it's

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.820 
the first place to be it's just it's
really<00:02:36.490> cool<00:02:36.820> and<00:02:37.630> so<00:02:38.050> it<00:02:38.260> comes<00:02:38.470> out<00:02:38.710> and

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
really cool and so it comes out and

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.500 
really cool and so it comes out and
spouts<00:02:39.100> to<00:02:39.490> the<00:02:39.580> cenotes<00:02:40.000> and<00:02:40.330> then<00:02:40.480> out<00:02:40.660> here

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
spouts to the cenotes and then out here

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:53.090 
spouts to the cenotes and then out here
the<00:02:43.510> top<00:02:45.180> most<00:02:46.180> people<00:02:49.410> and<00:02:50.410> then<00:02:50.820> with<00:02:51.820> that

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
the top most people and then with that

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.050 
the top most people and then with that
then<00:02:54.100> with<00:02:54.220> that<00:02:54.430> it<00:02:55.390> comes<00:02:55.720> out<00:02:56.760> it<00:02:57.760> has<00:02:57.940> these

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
then with that it comes out it has these

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.280 
then with that it comes out it has these
little<00:02:58.300> holes<00:02:58.510> down<00:02:58.750> the<00:02:58.930> bottom<00:02:59.170> of<00:02:59.230> the

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
little holes down the bottom of the

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.940 
little holes down the bottom of the
basket

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
basket

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:05.550 
basket

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
holes in the basket which kind of

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.710 
holes in the basket which kind of
overflows<00:03:09.100> when<00:03:09.370> she<00:03:09.520> gets<00:03:09.700> to<00:03:09.880> this<00:03:10.090> which<00:03:10.600> is

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
overflows when she gets to this which is

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.600 
overflows when she gets to this which is
how<00:03:10.750> you<00:03:10.900> get<00:03:11.050> this<00:03:11.200> right<00:03:11.440> here<00:03:11.740> in<00:03:12.220> the<00:03:12.400> flow

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
how you get this right here in the flow

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:13.949 
how you get this right here in the flow
rate<00:03:12.820> it's<00:03:13.330> pretty<00:03:13.540> cool

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
rate it's pretty cool

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:20.580 
rate it's pretty cool
I<00:03:13.989> mean<00:03:14.440> you<00:03:14.739> just<00:03:14.920> it's<00:03:15.430> just<00:03:15.520> awesome<00:03:19.170> and<00:03:20.170> so

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
I mean you just it's just awesome and so

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.570 
I mean you just it's just awesome and so
this<00:03:20.739> filter<00:03:20.980> pad<00:03:21.310> I<00:03:21.550> don't<00:03:21.700> know<00:03:23.430> what<00:03:24.430> we

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
this filter pad I don't know what we

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:30.090 
this filter pad I don't know what we
good<00:03:25.260> it<00:03:26.260> has<00:03:26.950> this<00:03:28.500> this<00:03:29.500> filter<00:03:29.830> pad<00:03:29.980> that

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
good it has this this filter pad that

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.560 
good it has this this filter pad that
picks<00:03:30.250> up<00:03:30.370> any<00:03:30.610> other<00:03:30.760> debris<00:03:31.090> that<00:03:31.180> hasn't

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
picks up any other debris that hasn't

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.990 
picks up any other debris that hasn't
got<00:03:31.690> that<00:03:31.870> back<00:03:32.200> didn't<00:03:32.650> get<00:03:33.190> stuck<00:03:33.790> to<00:03:33.970> the

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
got that back didn't get stuck to the

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.140 
got that back didn't get stuck to the
other<00:03:34.090> stuff<00:03:34.450> so<00:03:34.660> as<00:03:35.380> you<00:03:35.500> can<00:03:35.560> see<00:03:35.650> it's

other stuff so as you can see it's
pretty<00:03:37.150> tough<00:03:37.450> so<00:03:37.600> right<00:03:37.750> here<00:03:38.160> might<00:03:39.160> be

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
pretty tough so right here might be

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.729 
pretty tough so right here might be
pieces<00:03:39.670> of<00:03:39.760> wood<00:03:39.970> or<00:03:40.000> whatever<00:03:40.330> but<00:03:40.810> it's

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
pieces of wood or whatever but it's

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:44.460 
pieces of wood or whatever but it's
pretty<00:03:41.860> cool<00:03:42.070> so<00:03:42.790> the<00:03:42.940> last<00:03:43.120> little<00:03:43.470> nice
