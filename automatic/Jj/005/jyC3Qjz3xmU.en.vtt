your fat investment and you do that

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.110 
your fat investment and you do that
let's<00:01:16.320> say<00:01:16.409> for<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.620> next<00:01:16.920> ten<00:01:17.190> years<00:01:17.220> that's

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:18.120 
let's say for the next ten years that's

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.880 
let's say for the next ten years that's
six<00:01:18.390> thousand<00:01:18.690> dollars<00:01:18.720> of<00:01:19.140> course<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:19.800> would

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
six thousand dollars of course you would

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.710 
six thousand dollars of course you would
have<00:01:19.979> put<00:01:20.130> in<00:01:20.220> 60<00:01:20.580> grand<00:01:20.820> over<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.210> 10<00:01:21.690> years

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
have put in 60 grand over the 10 years

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.480 
have put in 60 grand over the 10 years
it<00:01:22.200> would<00:01:22.350> actually<00:01:22.470> be<00:01:22.680> worth<00:01:22.950> around<00:01:23.100> eighty

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
it would actually be worth around eighty

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.550 
it would actually be worth around eighty
seven<00:01:23.970> thousand<00:01:24.360> dollars<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:24.810> that's<00:01:25.320> good

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
seven thousand dollars and that's good

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.500 
seven thousand dollars and that's good
there's<00:01:25.979> nothing<00:01:26.159> wrong<00:01:26.490> with<00:01:26.549> that<00:01:26.850> now

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
there's nothing wrong with that now

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.120 
there's nothing wrong with that now
that's<00:01:28.049> what<00:01:28.200> most<00:01:28.320> people<00:01:28.620> do<00:01:28.680> I<00:01:28.740> call<00:01:29.010> it

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
that's what most people do I call it

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.910 
that's what most people do I call it
traditional<00:01:29.640> investing<00:01:30.060> now<00:01:30.840> an<00:01:31.170> alternative

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
traditional investing now an alternative

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.340 
traditional investing now an alternative
would<00:01:32.010> be<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.190> borrow<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:33.240> money<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.840> invest

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
would be to borrow the money and invest

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.110 
would be to borrow the money and invest
it<00:01:34.530> now<00:01:34.740> that<00:01:34.920> involves<00:01:35.250> certain<00:01:35.400> risks<00:01:35.909> but

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:36.120 
it now that involves certain risks but

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.520 
it now that involves certain risks but
let's<00:01:36.299> assume<00:01:36.420> for<00:01:36.659> a<00:01:36.870> second<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:37.380> can

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
let's assume for a second that you can

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.010 
let's assume for a second that you can
borrow<00:01:37.830> the<00:01:37.979> money<00:01:38.100> at<00:01:38.430> six<00:01:39.390> percent<00:01:39.750> interest

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
borrow the money at six percent interest

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.870 
borrow the money at six percent interest
rate<00:01:40.170> that<00:01:40.380> means<00:01:40.860> your<00:01:41.130> six<00:01:41.430> thousand

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
rate that means your six thousand

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.420 
rate that means your six thousand
dollars<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:42.240> year<00:01:42.540> goes<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:42.900> fund<00:01:43.440> that<00:01:43.979> loan

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
dollars a year goes to fund that loan

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.490 
dollars a year goes to fund that loan
now<00:01:45.299> what<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:45.630> do<00:01:45.840> is<00:01:45.869> you<00:01:46.049> take<00:01:46.080> that

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
now what you do is you take that

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.170 
now what you do is you take that
investment<00:01:47.010> loan<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.310> you<00:01:47.340> invest<00:01:47.760> it<00:01:47.940> and<00:01:48.030> if
