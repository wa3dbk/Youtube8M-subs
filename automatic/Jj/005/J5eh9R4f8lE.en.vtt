 and we have a small exclusive for you 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.450

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.030
 in fact in the games we have 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.650
 previously presented the video of 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.389
 two products presented to this piece of furniture 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.490
 world congress has allowed us to 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.830
 get a private meeting at the 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.470
 own conference room to test with 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.230
 hand and smartphone device voted to 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.080
 now v3 gaming the word a 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.730
 mauro who will exhibit his first 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.210
 impressions after testing this 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.009
 device friends digit china 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.079
 I give you a little hello then too 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.640
 what you see in mine 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:40.350
 hands is the w 3d is a device clearly 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.790
 very uncommon compared to those who 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.950
 we are used to seeing why 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.020
 clearly designed for gaming then 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.620
 the form factor in hand I thought 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.780
 honestly it was both heavier and 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:54.239
 more inconvenient I must be honest instead 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.000
 actually owned by the first psp 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.070
 I can tell you that more or less the size 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.410
 these are also the conception 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.329
 in short, the position of the pad keys 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.880
 clearly not the same though 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.520
 we are more or less there then this is the 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.380
 menu is a custom menu exists 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.100
 this is the operating system 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.890
 now 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.530
 forgive consider that if something 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.820
 maybe it will not go will not be right 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.290
 immediate is because it is really a 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.259
 very first contact 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.840
 the main screen looks a lot to me 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:28.130
 very well prone to well organized 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.409
 reminds me a lot of what i am and 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:34.070
 itv box android for example then with 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:36.560
 all the tiles all clearly visible well of 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.299
 first access then okay clearly 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.130
 being a smartphone anyway 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:43.100
 we have the function of the phone then 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.140
 we have everything about the 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.970
 address book contacts etc. 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.009
 now let's see the back side for a moment 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.780
 unfortunately they remain in plastic 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.539
 attach fingerprints 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.090
 let's say it's a plastic 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:57.710
 yes let's say more practically smooth here 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.810
 we have the camera and the speaker 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:03.920
 there are two system speakers 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:08.390
 stereo above we have some of the keys 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:11.900
 here l1 l2 r1 r2 r1 r2 excuse the button 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:15.500
 ignition and volume its volume down 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.970
 these are precisely the games is like 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.690
 having a joypad in your hand basically 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.940
 but now we can also try a first one 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.190
 gaming session we already have a 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.819
 open video game and we can of 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:31.910
 show you how fluidity anyway 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:33.560
 it looks pretty pretty high 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.569
 now forgive my inability in 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.549
 this videogame was not the least idea 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:40.910
 which video the video game is neither 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:42.799
 much less what I will be obliged to 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.400
 I imagine I have to follow this 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:45.400
 sideswipe 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:51.450
 fluidity and is very high 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.190
 does not even seem to overheat in 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.580
 no way considering that anyway 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:59.120
 being a device designed just for the 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.580
 gaming is possible that it may also 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.840
 overheat currently present 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.640
 in the back I can't hear the 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.580
 minimum on heating 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.520
 the touch anfield also of the keys and of the 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.780
 two pads is very very nice they are 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.350
 quite comfortable 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.970
 the run is rather short of the keys 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.770
 that I'm pressing right now and 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.930
 the directional arrows that are also 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:24.090
 among other things backlit also have 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.190
 to be a good taj finally here and maybe 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.650
 perhaps they are perhaps a little bit 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.700
 plastic like arrows but it seems to me 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.540
 very very very nice 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:36.430
 I would say that for this very first 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.830
 exclusive this very first contact with 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.420
 this gaming smartphone we can 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.700
 greet you and we can tell you that everything is 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.530
 we want to thank snail again

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.810
