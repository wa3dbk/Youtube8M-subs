and then I go to a see which yeah six

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.120 
and then I go to a see which yeah six
open<00:02:27.710> fifth<00:02:28.640> on<00:02:28.850> the<00:02:28.880> third<00:02:29.180> fret<00:02:29.830> fourth<00:02:30.830> on

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
open fifth on the third fret fourth on

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.620 
open fifth on the third fret fourth on
the<00:02:31.160> second<00:02:31.670> fret<00:02:31.910> third<00:02:32.410> open<00:02:33.910> -<00:02:34.910> on<00:02:35.330> the

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
the second fret third open - on the

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.890 
the second fret third open - on the
first<00:02:35.810> fret<00:02:36.110> and<00:02:36.380> then<00:02:36.620> six<00:02:37.280> open<00:02:37.760> so<00:02:38.630> just

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
first fret and then six open so just

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.510 
first fret and then six open so just
this<00:02:40.960> so<00:02:41.960> the<00:02:42.260> intro<00:02:42.500> sounds<00:02:42.980> like<00:02:43.160> this<00:02:43.310> when

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
this so the intro sounds like this when

00:02:43.520 --> 00:03:01.130 
this so the intro sounds like this when
you<00:02:43.610> put<00:02:43.730> it<00:02:43.850> together

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.930 

so<00:03:02.140> it<00:03:02.230> just<00:03:02.350> sounds<00:03:02.590> like<00:03:02.620> that<00:03:02.860> you<00:03:03.640> do<00:03:03.790> that

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
so it just sounds like that you do that

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.150 
so it just sounds like that you do that
a<00:03:03.970> couple<00:03:04.090> times<00:03:04.570> and<00:03:04.960> then<00:03:05.020> you<00:03:05.320> get<00:03:05.530> to<00:03:05.950> the

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
a couple times and then you get to the

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.300 
a couple times and then you get to the
kind<00:03:07.120> of<00:03:07.180> pre-chorus<00:03:07.660> thing<00:03:08.140> which<00:03:08.980> sounds

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
kind of pre-chorus thing which sounds

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:22.750 
kind of pre-chorus thing which sounds
like<00:03:09.400> this

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.059 

all<00:03:23.760> right<00:03:23.910> so<00:03:24.180> that<00:03:24.390> I<00:03:24.630> start<00:03:25.230> out<00:03:25.410> with<00:03:25.800> the<00:03:26.040> e

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
all right so that I start out with the e

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:31.809 
all right so that I start out with the e
minor<00:03:27.170> and<00:03:28.170> then<00:03:28.830> I<00:03:28.890> do<00:03:29.069> I<00:03:29.700> think<00:03:30.690> it<00:03:31.080> is<00:03:31.230> the

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:31.819 
minor and then I do I think it is the

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:36.500 
minor and then I do I think it is the
it's<00:03:32.819> either<00:03:33.000> d5<00:03:33.510> or<00:03:33.540> DSS<00:03:34.050> to<00:03:34.290> its<00:03:35.330> fifth<00:03:36.330> and

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
it's either d5 or DSS to its fifth and

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.790 
it's either d5 or DSS to its fifth and
sixth<00:03:37.020> stringer<00:03:37.380> muted<00:03:38.209> North<00:03:39.209> is<00:03:39.420> open<00:03:39.810> third

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
sixth stringer muted North is open third

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.120 
sixth stringer muted North is open third
is<00:03:41.040> on<00:03:41.160> the<00:03:41.280> second<00:03:41.670> fret<00:03:42.080> to<00:03:43.080> second<00:03:43.740> is<00:03:43.890> on

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
is on the second fret to second is on

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.210 
is on the second fret to second is on
the<00:03:44.340> third<00:03:44.730> fret<00:03:45.150> and<00:03:45.709> the<00:03:46.709> 1st<00:03:46.740> string<00:03:47.010> is

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
the third fret and the 1st string is

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:55.300 
the third fret and the 1st string is
also<00:03:47.370> muted<00:03:47.880> so<00:03:48.209> it<00:03:48.330> sounds<00:03:48.570> like<00:03:48.660> this

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.190 

this<00:03:55.820> is<00:03:55.940> the<00:03:56.030> court<00:03:56.240> I<00:03:56.300> forgot<00:03:56.630> to<00:03:56.780> name<00:03:56.960> so

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
every time I say the court I forgot it's

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.800 
every time I say the court I forgot it's
this<00:03:59.660> one<00:03:59.870> which<00:04:00.710> is<00:04:00.980> you<00:04:01.850> have<00:04:01.970> the<00:04:02.480> third

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
this one which is you have the third

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.210 
this one which is you have the third
fret<00:04:03.140> on<00:04:03.380> the<00:04:03.470> sixth<00:04:03.950> string<00:04:04.190> fifth<00:04:05.060> is<00:04:05.240> muted

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
fret on the sixth string fifth is muted

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.330

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
on the third fret and first is muted so

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:19.960 
on the third fret and first is muted so
it<00:04:14.030> sounds<00:04:14.240> like<00:04:14.360> this

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:25.720 

the<00:04:20.970> CSS<00:04:21.419> to

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:25.730

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.750 
and then on that second time around you
don't<00:04:36.990> do<00:04:37.230> the<00:04:37.380> CSS<00:04:37.830> to<00:04:38.040> and<00:04:38.250> you<00:04:38.310> just<00:04:38.490> go

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
don't do the CSS to and you just go

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:43.570 
don't do the CSS to and you just go
