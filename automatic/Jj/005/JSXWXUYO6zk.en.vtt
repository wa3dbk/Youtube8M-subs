00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:48.879
 mixes on joey i'll even tell you 

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:50.859
 missions are easier nowhere so I thought 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:53.379
 she won't have a problem with us 

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:55.749
 well let's talk more 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:59.739
 commissions I will sort out the organs and so 

00:00:55.749 --> 00:01:01.389
 okay then let's start already so we 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.369
 met in this part with a new 

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:06.940
 whose character is called tony sipar not 

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:08.710
 I know a little about him that he was 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.340
 the main character of the game gta liberty city 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.230
 stories 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.380
 is that his father died early in her 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:15.730
 brought up by a single mother 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.390
 what do we see tony arrived 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:26.260
 deal with countries in the laundry where 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:29.680
 his money is like that 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:31.460
 and they respond to the chambers like this 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.940
 but let the lions 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:37.159
 albeit fat but ran away so yes to us 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:40.150
 now we must quickly avoid this 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:43.729
 zones and lead him to the summer cafe 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:45.530
 the cafe is very old so this is already 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:49.759
 so it is clear that there is also an old hotel 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:52.490
 no longer wants to remake cafe cafe 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:54.020
 located near the St. Mark's restaurant 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.619
 so I think you will not get lost 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.390
 Here is this cafe torture staged for three years 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.909
 the ambush did not give even tony to pick up their 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.360
 money but then they are not easy it will 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.479
 revenge 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.460
 he will carry tim and giving us such 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:08.869
 different tasks when we will 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.150

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.030

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.350
