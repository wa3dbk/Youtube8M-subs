boosted is kind of changing the world of

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:16.250 
boosted is kind of changing the world of
electric<00:00:15.389> vehicles<00:00:15.420> but<00:00:16.080> in<00:00:16.199> an

unconventional way fifty percent of all

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.240 
unconventional way fifty percent of all
trips<00:00:18.810> that<00:00:18.930> people<00:00:19.199> take<00:00:19.350> in<00:00:19.529> cars<00:00:19.770> or<00:00:20.039> under

five<00:00:20.460> miles<00:00:20.699> and<00:00:21.119> that's<00:00:21.630> twenty<00:00:21.930> five

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
five miles and that's twenty five

really<00:00:25.170> we<00:00:25.560> see<00:00:25.769> as<00:00:26.039> our<00:00:26.369> first<00:00:26.670> product<00:00:26.910> we

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
really we see as our first product we

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.599 
really we see as our first product we
really<00:00:27.689> think<00:00:27.900> that<00:00:28.140> this<00:00:28.410> powertrain<00:00:28.920> can

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
really think that this powertrain can

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.209 
really think that this powertrain can
allow<00:00:30.060> us<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.449> reimagine<00:00:30.929> what<00:00:31.410> a<00:00:31.439> vehicle<00:00:32.009> can

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
allow us to reimagine what a vehicle can

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.069 
allow us to reimagine what a vehicle can
be<00:00:32.430> so<00:00:33.239> we<00:00:33.329> started<00:00:33.600> with<00:00:33.690> something<00:00:33.870> that's

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
be so we started with something that's

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.450 
be so we started with something that's
already<00:00:34.290> really<00:00:34.620> efficient<00:00:35.010> then<00:00:35.219> you<00:00:35.309> use

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
already really efficient then you use

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.010 
already really efficient then you use
really<00:00:35.850> efficient<00:00:36.270> motors<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:36.750> really

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
really efficient motors and really

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.510 
really efficient motors and really
efficient<00:00:37.469> batteries<00:00:37.829> you<00:00:38.280> design

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
efficient batteries you design

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.130 
efficient batteries you design
electronics<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.239> software<00:00:39.450> really<00:00:39.960> well

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
electronics and software really well

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.690 
electronics and software really well
then<00:00:40.500> you<00:00:40.590> get<00:00:40.770> basically<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.370> lightest

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
then you get basically the lightest

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.650 
then you get basically the lightest
electric<00:00:42.000> vehicle<00:00:42.329> that's<00:00:42.450> ever<00:00:42.600> been<00:00:42.780> made

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
can climb hills a couple years ago that

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.100 
can climb hills a couple years ago that
would<00:01:15.850> have<00:01:15.880> been<00:01:16.060> completely<00:01:16.479> unheard<00:01:16.990> of

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
would have been completely unheard of

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.290 
would have been completely unheard of
but<00:01:17.710> with<00:01:17.830> that<00:01:18.040> we've<00:01:18.340> added<00:01:18.369> regenerative

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:19.300 
but with that we've added regenerative

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.480 
but with that we've added regenerative
braking<00:01:19.690> so<00:01:20.140> not<00:01:20.380> only<00:01:20.500> can<00:01:20.619> you<00:01:20.830> stop<00:01:21.040> easily

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
braking so not only can you stop easily

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.190 
braking so not only can you stop easily
but<00:01:21.759> you<00:01:21.910> recharge<00:01:22.300> the<00:01:22.450> battery<00:01:22.750> when<00:01:22.960> you<00:01:23.050> do

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
but you recharge the battery when you do

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.139 
but you recharge the battery when you do
it<00:01:23.430> right<00:01:24.430> now<00:01:24.490> we<00:01:24.670> have<00:01:24.880> some<00:01:25.030> awesome

00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:25.149 
it right now we have some awesome

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.480 
the best longboarding companies in world
loaded<00:01:29.050> and<00:01:29.200> the<00:01:29.470> idea<00:01:29.680> behind<00:01:29.860> that<00:01:30.039> was<00:01:30.280> a<00:01:30.310> we

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
loaded and the idea behind that was a we

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.370 
loaded and the idea behind that was a we
want<00:01:30.640> to<00:01:30.729> start<00:01:30.940> with<00:01:31.000> really<00:01:31.330> great<00:01:31.479> stuff<00:01:31.750> we

want to start with really great stuff we

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.139 
want to start with really great stuff we
felt<00:01:32.619> that<00:01:32.680> it<00:01:32.800> was<00:01:33.130> important<00:01:33.610> to<00:01:33.640> keep<00:01:33.940> this

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:34.149

is actually closer to snowboarding and
to<00:01:39.399> surfing<00:01:39.880> we're<00:01:40.600> taking<00:01:40.990> that<00:01:41.259> niche

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
to surfing we're taking that niche

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:43.920 
to surfing we're taking that niche
market<00:01:42.160> of<00:01:42.310> longboarders<00:01:43.000> being<00:01:43.660> able<00:01:43.810> to

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
those mentors is really key because the

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.410 
those mentors is really key because the
experience<00:01:54.700> that<00:01:54.729> they<00:01:54.819> have<00:01:55.119> and<00:01:55.300> actually

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
experience that they have and actually

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.089 
experience that they have and actually
bringing<00:01:55.780> something<00:01:55.990> to<00:01:56.140> market<00:01:56.500> makes<00:01:56.950> it

00:01:57.089 --> 00:01:57.099 
bringing something to market makes it

00:01:57.099 --> 00:01:58.680 
bringing something to market makes it
way<00:01:57.310> way<00:01:57.610> easier<00:01:57.640> to<00:01:58.179> avoid<00:01:58.420> a<00:01:58.479> lot<00:01:58.630> of

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
way way easier to avoid a lot of

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.240 
way way easier to avoid a lot of
mistakes<00:01:58.899> that<00:01:59.229> most<00:01:59.259> hardware<00:01:59.709> companies<00:02:00.099> do

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
mistakes that most hardware companies do

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.300 
mistakes that most hardware companies do
when<00:02:00.369> they're<00:02:00.490> first<00:02:00.640> starting<00:02:00.759> out<00:02:02.310> I'm

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
when they're first starting out I'm

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.279 
when they're first starting out I'm
really<00:02:03.369> excited<00:02:03.940> about<00:02:04.300> the<00:02:04.479> idea<00:02:04.599> of<00:02:04.810> good

00:02:05.279 --> 00:02:05.289 
really excited about the idea of good

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:07.350 
really excited about the idea of good
electric<00:02:05.740> transportation<00:02:06.160> I<00:02:06.670> don't<00:02:07.179> think

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
electric transportation I don't think

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.969 
electric transportation I don't think
the<00:02:07.479> world<00:02:07.660> has<00:02:07.810> seen<00:02:08.170> how<00:02:08.440> good<00:02:08.679> it<00:02:08.830> actually

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
the world has seen how good it actually

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.089 
the world has seen how good it actually
can<00:02:09.459> be<00:02:09.929> right<00:02:10.929> now<00:02:11.140> we're<00:02:11.500> trying<00:02:11.740> to<00:02:11.890> make

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:12.099 
can be right now we're trying to make

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:14.280 
can be right now we're trying to make
the<00:02:12.520> best<00:02:12.550> electric<00:02:13.510> longboard<00:02:13.750> that<00:02:14.170> has

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
the best electric longboard that has

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.920 
the best electric longboard that has
ever<00:02:14.530> been<00:02:14.680> invented

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
ever been invented

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.709 
ever been invented
this<00:02:16.890> isn't<00:02:17.159> an<00:02:17.219> easy<00:02:17.370> task<00:02:17.549> it's<00:02:18.239> a<00:02:18.420> hardware

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:18.719 
this isn't an easy task it's a hardware

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:20.839 
this isn't an easy task it's a hardware
product<00:02:19.260> it's<00:02:19.620> really<00:02:19.859> expensive<00:02:20.099> to<00:02:20.430> make<00:02:20.700> it

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
product it's really expensive to make it

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.160 
product it's really expensive to make it
as<00:02:20.939> really<00:02:21.090> expensive<00:02:21.329> to<00:02:21.689> get<00:02:21.780> all<00:02:21.930> the<00:02:22.019> bugs

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
as really expensive to get all the bugs

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.289 
as really expensive to get all the bugs
worked<00:02:22.469> out<00:02:22.680> and<00:02:22.890> develop<00:02:23.069> on<00:02:23.370> it<00:02:23.519> and<00:02:23.640> so<00:02:24.180> it's

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
worked out and develop on it and so it's

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:25.280 
worked out and develop on it and so it's
something<00:02:24.420> that<00:02:24.629> we<00:02:24.689> really<00:02:24.750> passionate
