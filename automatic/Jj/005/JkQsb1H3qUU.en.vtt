00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:13.889
 Welcome to our 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.299
 press conference after the home game against 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.279
 the sv werder bremen 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.930
 greet the guests from the weser the 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.170
 accompanying journalists and representatives 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.750
 the club and may ask with skripnik 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.250
 balance sheet because we immediately 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.769
 are very happy with this three 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.539
 This is not important for us 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.099
 only reaction of team important for 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.290
 we finally played to zero 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.559
 We conceded so many goals 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.989
 Last week that we finally have 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.870
 played to zero and our goalkeeper no 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.170
 Tor conceded and makes a good parade 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.539
 I'm really happy for him personally 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:52.020
 maybe we can now partie 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.809
 I enjoy the preparation this time 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.780
 Now to the other game last game 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.640
 against bavaria munich at home 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:03.539
 that we can be that really shines 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.369
 us because not only that we have to 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.680
 best minute already right in the game 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.030
 we have concentrated as I have 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.420
 I noticed immediately that it 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.970
 Team really took everything seriously and 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.460
 I'm just happy and so 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.439
 held the to the conclusion that we 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.150
 maybe earn a profit where you can 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.520
 you say that of course there is where 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.860
 you stand by contemporary you try 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.770
 it's clear that it's tight 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.470
 we know that it is always Freiburg 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.750
 enlivened at ball height and good passes 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.100
 play look to the end 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.259
 just try it 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.770
 footballing solution at the end 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.600
 come and we have really right 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.520
 analyzed and made preparation and 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.439
 This reason I am glad that one has 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.780
 we do not just do everything right today 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.700
 played but against because work 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.740
 of course with such players as the 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:57.329
 santa are so completely against nothing 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.100
 victor that's really great of him 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.630
 and again 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:05.380
 we are happy that the three points 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:14.560
 we take with pleasure and really much 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:22.780
 good luck for the player and thanks to the 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:27.130
 scoring game rated the 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:29.140
 the team was highly motivated in the game 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.750
 come back we had now 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:36.670
 again more alternatives to the substitute 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:40.630
 and not very well into the game purely 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:43.569
 Of course, what you have to say is that 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:47.260
 you already play many games a problem 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:48.459
 if you like the bremen team i 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.299
 do not know how much you are in the square 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:53.130
 had six players with a 90 and 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:57.190
 more 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:03:01.599
 we have enormous disadvantages in the market 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:03.970
 size and a lot of games as well as in 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:06.370
 bremen comes under pressure to play it 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:10.600
 simply you can play ball games for a long time 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:12.400
 and then you have huge players in it 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.079
 the defensive where they are occupied and 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:18.630
 Of course we did not like that 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:18.630
 we have to do everything almost everything and deliver 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:25.030
 di santo makes this gate that was one 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:27.430
 Lucky shot that was quality one has 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.690
 I saw it at the back he can 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.760
 long time has the ball so long 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.260
 to be able to accept and wanted exactly 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.959
 But there still shoots in shooting 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.060
 But that's not why the manual out 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.489
 not at all but me 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.280
 Mark Oliver have fought with it 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:44.940
 we are shifting the game against the rhombus 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:48.370
 can play with his left foot 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:51.579
 team has given everything if you like that 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:54.180
 look at the games now I do not know 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:56.290
 how often do you have now lost 10 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.989
 the first day of the game started 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.910
 we have lost 30 else once 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:04.470
 close games 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:06.900
 what we lack is then the very last one 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.400
 Potency and conviction around 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.819
 to make goals from the game out the 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.560
 is a problem exists 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:17.079
 we have a lot of close games 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.600
 then can not make the gates and 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:21.459
 if you then get through except we were 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.960
 yes very often in dangerous spaces on the 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:27.699
 page then stands in prÃ¶dl and 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.490
 Westergaard Flachgau cut players 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:32.979
 because bremen then stood very low and one 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:37.030
 play stephan in and there was one 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:39.660
 Extreme disadvantage in the size once 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:42.160
 the golfer fights had a great chance 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.570
 concert benefit of the team is 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.759
 nothing to blame 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:47.830
 We have not quite had the rhythm 

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:52.720
 he could not quite reach the back 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:56.650
 pure pushing constantly but it also 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:58.000
 difficult the some premiums stable and 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.289
 unfortunately we have a game again 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.070
 lost and of course that is very 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:03.880
 bitter but i can on the performance 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.720
 build up 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.830
 the mentality i class for the guys 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.020
 I felt it was further 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.460
 now again if you do not become now 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.940
 the opec had like the whole season 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:18.039
 with illness and injuries 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.389
 then I am convinced that we are also in 

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:22.349
 wolfsburg and then with the augsburger 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:26.380
 could make good game 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:28.330
 Thank you, thanks for your help 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:32.860
 ask again hand signals and then 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:34.000
 microphone is not the case then 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.180
 munich yesterday from bremen good 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.180
 way home
