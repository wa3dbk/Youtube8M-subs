Oh Reeth well I've just necked a full
packet<00:00:04.710> of<00:00:04.830> Roundtree's<00:00:05.430> randoms<00:00:06.410> so<00:00:07.410> the

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
packet of Roundtree's randoms so the

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.950 
packet of Roundtree's randoms so the
words<00:00:07.680> I'm<00:00:07.890> saying<00:00:08.189> may<00:00:09.150> not<00:00:09.330> necessarily

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
words I'm saying may not necessarily

words I'm saying may not necessarily
make<00:00:10.139> that<00:00:10.380> much<00:00:10.559> sense<00:00:11.900> which<00:00:12.900> of<00:00:13.380> us<00:00:13.440> has<00:00:13.710> a

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
make that much sense which of us has a

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.129 
make that much sense which of us has a
grid<00:00:14.040> an<00:00:14.160> introduction<00:00:15.000> to<00:00:15.240> a<00:00:15.269> video<00:00:15.570> you<00:00:15.990> know

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
grid an introduction to a video you know

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.130 
grid an introduction to a video you know
but<00:00:16.410> anywhere<00:00:17.390> there<00:00:18.390> you'll<00:00:18.720> see<00:00:18.900> a<00:00:18.930> hole

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
but anywhere there you'll see a hole

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.480 
but anywhere there you'll see a hole
there<00:00:19.410> and<00:00:19.619> that's<00:00:19.770> where<00:00:19.949> my<00:00:20.100> foot<00:00:20.279> will<00:00:20.460> be

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
there and that's where my foot will be

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.130 
there and that's where my foot will be
going<00:00:20.730> a<00:00:20.910> bit<00:00:21.029> wrong<00:00:21.300> as<00:00:21.600> I'm<00:00:21.779> flowing

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
going a bit wrong as I'm flowing

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.519 
going a bit wrong as I'm flowing
filament<00:00:22.920> they<00:00:23.460> gonna<00:00:23.670> kick<00:00:24.000> it<00:00:24.090> in<00:00:24.180> already

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529 
filament they gonna kick it in already

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:32.049 
filament they gonna kick it in already
as<00:00:25.529> I'm<00:00:26.189> filming<00:00:26.840> this<00:00:27.840> video<00:00:29.359> I'm<00:00:30.359> also<00:00:30.539> not

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 
as I'm filming this video I'm also not

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:37.160 
as I'm filming this video I'm also not
doing<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.600> these<00:00:34.079> figures<00:00:34.559> in<00:00:35.510> sequence<00:00:36.510> so

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
doing the these figures in sequence so

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.410 
doing the these figures in sequence so
this<00:00:37.620> is<00:00:37.770> actually<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.489> first<00:00:38.670> video<00:00:38.910> or<00:00:39.210> even

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
this is actually the first video or even

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.319 
this is actually the first video or even
though<00:00:39.800> it'll<00:00:40.800> not<00:00:41.040> be<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.370> first<00:00:41.610> video<00:00:41.850> in

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
though it'll not be the first video in

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.690 
though it'll not be the first video in
the<00:00:42.480> series<00:00:43.610> but<00:00:44.870> so<00:00:45.920> I'm<00:00:46.920> pretty<00:00:47.370> sure<00:00:47.520> this

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
the series but so I'm pretty sure this

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.420 
the series but so I'm pretty sure this
is<00:00:47.760> all<00:00:48.090> of<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.450> jack<00:00:49.230> specific<00:00:49.770> mid-range

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
is all of the jack specific mid-range

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.619 
is all of the jack specific mid-range
figures<00:00:50.820> I<00:00:50.910> have<00:00:51.379> so<00:00:52.379> obviously<00:00:53.129> if<00:00:53.250> any<00:00:53.629> turn

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
figures I have so obviously if any turn

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.110 
figures I have so obviously if any turn
up<00:00:54.809> whilst<00:00:55.079> I'm<00:00:55.350> doing<00:00:55.770> other<00:00:56.520> videos<00:00:56.879> I'll

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
up whilst I'm doing other videos I'll

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.900 
up whilst I'm doing other videos I'll
just<00:00:57.360> toss<00:00:58.320> them<00:00:58.530> in<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:59.160> explain<00:00:59.579> it<00:00:59.760> there

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
just toss them in and explain it there

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.860 
just toss them in and explain it there
and<00:01:00.059> then<00:01:00.210> so<00:01:01.170> anyway<00:01:01.440> without<00:01:01.649> further<00:01:01.770> ado

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
and then so anyway without further ado

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.250 
and then so anyway without further ado
I'll<00:01:03.870> there<00:01:04.260> I'll<00:01:04.559> start<00:01:04.890> off<00:01:05.990> at<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.049> top

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
I'll there I'll start off at the top

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:14.719 
I'll there I'll start off at the top
here<00:01:07.650> just<00:01:10.880> right<00:01:12.140> basically<00:01:13.340> this<00:01:14.340> was<00:01:14.610> the

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
here just right basically this was the

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.090 
here just right basically this was the
transition<00:01:15.299> with<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.320> jack<00:01:16.619> specific

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
transition with the jack specific

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.660 
transition with the jack specific
figures<00:01:17.369> from<00:01:17.610> there<00:01:17.939> kind<00:01:18.240> of<00:01:18.650> muscle<00:01:20.810> column

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
figures from there kind of muscle column

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.490 
figures from there kind of muscle column
yeah<00:01:24.290> born<00:01:25.290> bending<00:01:25.860> ones<00:01:26.840> but<00:01:27.840> cast<00:01:28.140> trouble

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
yeah born bending ones but cast trouble

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.069 
yeah born bending ones but cast trouble
here<00:01:28.880> and<00:01:29.880> bit<00:01:30.180> see<00:01:30.299> what<00:01:30.420> these<00:01:30.509> were<00:01:30.810> like

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
here and bit see what these were like

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.350 
here and bit see what these were like
the<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.770> new<00:01:31.920> bodies<00:01:32.250> but<00:01:32.670> with<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.090> Gannet

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
the the new bodies but with the Gannet

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.289 
the the new bodies but with the Gannet
all<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.630> heads<00:01:34.520> there<00:01:35.520> before<00:01:35.909> I<00:01:35.939> started

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
all the heads there before I started

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.840 
all the heads there before I started
doing<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:37.049> real<00:01:37.259> scan<00:01:37.680> fierce<00:01:38.159> official

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
doing the the real scan fierce official

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.319 
doing the the real scan fierce official
this<00:01:39.740> so<00:01:40.740> I<00:01:41.250> suppose<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.549> best<00:01:41.700> Athenians<00:01:42.210> as

sort of real scan fish versions of

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.690 
sort of real scan fish versions of
obviously<00:01:56.460> Mick<00:01:57.119> Foley<00:01:57.420> edge<00:01:58.070> Vince<00:01:59.070> McMahon
