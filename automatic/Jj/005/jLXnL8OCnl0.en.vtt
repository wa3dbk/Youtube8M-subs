00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.400 

I<00:00:02.300> think<00:00:03.300> barefoot<00:00:03.750> running<00:00:03.959> is<00:00:04.200> so

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
I think barefoot running is so

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.759 
I think barefoot running is so
intriguing<00:00:08.599> there's<00:00:09.599> just<00:00:09.960> not<00:00:10.320> much

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
intriguing there's just not much

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.970 
intriguing there's just not much
information<00:00:11.099> out<00:00:11.969> there<00:00:12.000> about<00:00:12.980> barefoot

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
information out there about barefoot

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.490 
information out there about barefoot
running<00:00:14.490> and<00:00:14.900> how<00:00:15.900> it<00:00:16.080> might<00:00:16.320> impact

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
running and how it might impact

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.189 
running and how it might impact

there's<00:00:19.199> thoughts<00:00:19.939> but<00:00:20.939> there's<00:00:21.390> really<00:00:21.600> no

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
there's thoughts but there's really no

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
thing is that we're looking at

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.170 
thing is that we're looking at
performance

a track great job seven 38 39 and we're

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.799 
a track great job seven 38 39 and we're
collecting<00:01:00.539> data<00:01:01.020> while<00:01:01.350> they<00:01:01.559> run<00:01:01.829> that<00:01:02.340> race

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
collecting data while they run that race

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.289 
collecting data while they run that race
we're<00:01:03.809> recruiting<00:01:04.350> subjects<00:01:05.100> all<00:01:05.790> over<00:01:06.210> the

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
we're recruiting subjects all over the

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.240 
we're recruiting subjects all over the
state<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.630> into<00:01:07.200> Massachusetts<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:08.010> even

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
state and into Massachusetts and even

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.210 
state and into Massachusetts and even
mean<00:01:08.490> they<00:01:09.360> have<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.600> be<00:01:09.720> competitive<00:01:10.220> runners

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
mean they have to be competitive runners

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.160 
mean they have to be competitive runners
they<00:01:11.580> can<00:01:11.760> be<00:01:11.880> either<00:01:12.000> barefoot<00:01:12.510> runners<00:01:12.810> or

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
they can be either barefoot runners or

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.760 
they can be either barefoot runners or
shoe<00:01:13.380> runners<00:01:15.020> what<00:01:16.020> they'll<00:01:16.200> do<00:01:16.409> is<00:01:16.619> they

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
shoe runners what they'll do is they

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.730 
shoe runners what they'll do is they
will<00:01:16.799> come<00:01:17.100> into<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.549> lab<00:01:18.210> two<00:01:18.720> times<00:01:18.990> so<00:01:19.590> this

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
will come into the lab two times so this

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.310 
will come into the lab two times so this
is<00:01:19.860> your<00:01:20.009> speed<00:01:20.250> so<00:01:20.520> feel<00:01:20.729> good<00:01:20.990> look<00:01:21.990> at<00:01:22.110> their

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
is your speed so feel good look at their

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.980 
is your speed so feel good look at their
their<00:01:22.619> vo2<00:01:23.340> max<00:01:23.759> test<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.450> where<00:01:24.570> we<00:01:24.720> find<00:01:24.900> out

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
their vo2 max test and where we find out

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.530 
their vo2 max test and where we find out
their<00:01:25.140> maximal<00:01:25.530> oxygen<00:01:25.650> consumption<00:01:26.540> the

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
their maximal oxygen consumption the

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.359 
their maximal oxygen consumption the
test<00:01:27.840> starts<00:01:28.320> at<00:01:28.470> an<00:01:28.590> even<00:01:28.860> grade<00:01:29.040> they<00:01:29.189> stay

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
test starts at an even grade they stay

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.710 
test starts at an even grade they stay
at<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.549> same<00:01:29.729> speed<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.090> whole<00:01:30.210> time<00:01:30.479> and

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
at the same speed the whole time and

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.630 
at the same speed the whole time and
every<00:01:31.140> minute<00:01:31.439> we<00:01:31.560> go<00:01:31.680> up<00:01:31.770> two<00:01:32.009> percent<00:01:32.430> grade

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
every minute we go up two percent grade

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.859 
every minute we go up two percent grade
so<00:01:33.420> they<00:01:33.450> keep<00:01:33.750> ramping<00:01:34.140> it<00:01:34.409> up<00:01:34.500> ramping<00:01:34.860> up

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
so they keep ramping it up ramping up

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:39.100 
so they keep ramping it up ramping up
until<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.110> subject<00:01:37.350> cannot<00:01:37.890> run<00:01:38.400> any<00:01:38.729> longer

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
until the subject cannot run any longer

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.649 
until the subject cannot run any longer
okay<00:01:40.110> nice<00:01:40.610> and<00:01:41.610> then<00:01:42.329> they'll<00:01:42.450> come<00:01:42.630> back

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
okay nice and then they'll come back

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.590 
okay nice and then they'll come back
four<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.259> seven<00:01:43.590> days<00:01:43.619> later<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.399> do<00:01:45.060> their

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
four to seven days later and do their

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.039 
four to seven days later and do their
runnin<00:01:45.930> economy<00:01:46.500> be<00:01:47.100> comfortable<00:01:47.579> okay<00:01:48.540> and

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
runnin economy be comfortable okay and

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.080 
runnin economy be comfortable okay and
we<00:01:49.560> get<00:01:49.710> them<00:01:49.829> right<00:01:50.040> on<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.250> treadmill<00:01:50.759> and

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
we get them right on the treadmill and

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.120 
we get them right on the treadmill and
what<00:01:51.450> we're<00:01:51.600> doing<00:01:51.630> is<00:01:52.170> having<00:01:52.710> them<00:01:52.860> run<00:01:53.009> at

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
what we're doing is having them run at

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.890 
what we're doing is having them run at
three<00:01:53.399> different<00:01:53.549> speeds

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 
three different speeds

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.120 
three different speeds
on<00:01:55.740> flat<00:01:56.150> decline<00:01:57.150> and<00:01:57.630> on<00:01:57.750> an<00:01:57.870> incline<00:01:58.320> okay

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
on flat decline and on an incline okay

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.160 
on flat decline and on an incline okay
you<00:01:59.190> can<00:01:59.550> hop<00:01:59.760> off<00:02:00.030> hands<00:02:00.540> on<00:02:00.660> the<00:02:00.780> handrail

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
you can hop off hands on the handrail

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.410 
you can hop off hands on the handrail
just<00:02:01.440> jump<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:01.890> side<00:02:02.220> after<00:02:02.640> that<00:02:03.060> is<00:02:03.270> all

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
just jump to the side after that is all

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.500 
just jump to the side after that is all
said<00:02:03.660> and<00:02:03.690> done<00:02:03.870> great<00:02:04.710> job<00:02:05.070> we<00:02:05.880> walk<00:02:06.090> over<00:02:06.390> to

alone<00:02:13.980> one<00:02:14.460> mile<00:02:14.700> left<00:02:14.970> you<00:02:15.210> have<00:02:15.420> it<00:02:15.630> come<00:02:15.810> on

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
alone one mile left you have it come on

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.260 
alone one mile left you have it come on
push<00:02:16.230> it<00:02:16.260> through<00:02:16.620> push<00:02:16.920> it<00:02:17.040> through<00:02:17.270> they've

push it through push it through they've

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.020 
push it through push it through they've
really<00:02:18.720> come<00:02:19.500> a<00:02:19.560> long<00:02:19.800> way<00:02:20.100> the<00:02:20.460> engineering

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
really come a long way the engineering

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.570 
really come a long way the engineering
department<00:02:21.510> I'd<00:02:21.630> say<00:02:21.990> as<00:02:22.350> far<00:02:22.740> as<00:02:22.800> the<00:02:23.070> masks

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
department I'd say as far as the masks

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.510 
department I'd say as far as the masks
that<00:02:23.820> the<00:02:24.320> subjects<00:02:25.320> get<00:02:25.500> to<00:02:25.680> wear<00:02:25.860> a<00:02:26.130> lot<00:02:26.460> of

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
that the subjects get to wear a lot of

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.670 
that the subjects get to wear a lot of
people<00:02:26.940> are<00:02:27.300> really<00:02:27.570> worried<00:02:28.080> about<00:02:28.230> it<00:02:28.560> they

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
people are really worried about it they

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.260 
people are really worried about it they
go<00:02:28.800> what<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.220> heck<00:02:29.400> is<00:02:29.580> this<00:02:29.730> thing<00:02:29.790> on<00:02:30.120> my

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
go what the heck is this thing on my

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.450 
go what the heck is this thing on my
face<00:02:30.510> but<00:02:30.870> you<00:02:30.990> know<00:02:31.110> what<00:02:31.320> once<00:02:31.890> they<00:02:32.100> start

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.520 
face but you know what once they start
running<00:02:32.640> that's<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:33.630> last<00:02:33.900> thing<00:02:34.200> on<00:02:34.380> their

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
running that's the last thing on their

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.620 
running that's the last thing on their
mind<00:02:34.800> and<00:02:35.040> it's<00:02:35.250> actually<00:02:35.760> not<00:02:36.300> that
