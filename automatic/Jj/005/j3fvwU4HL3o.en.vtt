00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.570
 side we have the guy this guy is 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:49.820

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.450
 this guy makes his living fighting in 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.150
 clandestine fights like that inside 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.860
 school and earn money through the 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.750
 you bet that kind of thing and then 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.860
 typically all the leaves of the 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.290
 school have other 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.780
 these his kids are known but for 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.280
 various situations and third parties 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.680
 they start talking more and they start having 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.440
 more like a relationship of friends without 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.150
 But our romance begins with a 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.610
 bet a bet that determined 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.770
 what marks the beginning this romance the 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.080
 put to the following and travis wins 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.500
 one of his fights without receiving any 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.470
 hit here will have to move live with 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.110
 him for a month however if travis 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.610
 loses or receives a blow this boy is 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.620
 will have to refrain from having 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.310
 sex with any girl 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.630
 all this month then this bet on the 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.120
 that marks the beginning of a relationship 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.860
 love-hate that at least I had not seen 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.480
 in no other book we see two worlds 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.690
 different who want to join and how 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.490
 we know then yes yes it is difficult then 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.680
 that 's what revolves around our 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.260
 story to these two guys who have 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.260
 as different proposals have 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.970
 they come from totally different past 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.920
 you deepen a very story 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.080
 entertaining and that you get hooked tyrol and 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.840
 I think in three days because once 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.730
 you start already you want to finish it to know 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.950
 what all this ends in because this 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.190
 romance is very very very entertaining father 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.110
 super mega ultra super youthful a 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.120
 aspect that I liked very much were the 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.620
 characters actually the characters 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.970
 that have a place in this story is 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.340
 say that they interact with the 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.840
 protagonists 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:34.080
 If I tell you days, I think there are many 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.730
 and that has its pros and cons but 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.440
 I think it has more pros than cons 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.420
 society that are few allows you to 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.370
 you center that you focus on the 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.170
 main story in the 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.270
 protagonists and what is spinning in 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.280
 around them because many times you 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.750
 they put a stream of characters all with 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.940
 different personals all with 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.490
 different stories and that makes you like 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.960
 that you can not focus on just one 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.690
 because you're already getting the story 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.910
 from another I liked that they were so few and 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.950
 with the well-defined character 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.650
 Ã¡vila protagonist without months but at 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.630
 beginning months but enough because no 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.280
 he understood why he did not want it and then he 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.460
 I wanted it in the hairs I wanted through and 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.020
 then if there will not be times but a lot but 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.630
 and again that you realize 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:18.550
 because she is like that and it looks like you 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:21.370
 make was for this 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:23.230
 with this I also want to do another one that 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.000
 another point in favor of history the 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.800
 history is full of very few dialogue 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.300
 moments allows you to see the mind of 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.640
 no one despite the fact that she is the one 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:33.070
 is counting it and that all those from 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.900
 your perspective like there are very few 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:36.820
 the spaces in which it already begins to 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.590
 tell what's on your mind or whatever 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.360
 she feels what she thinks it 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.830
 what do you really think 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.480
 account what you are doing here and what 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.820
 that she thinks and likes for 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.010
 decisions that are taking but as they 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.840
 I say is very little the moments in which 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.030
 I had is the way she reflects 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:56.170
 things and he made me father by another 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:59.220
 What I liked was the writing of 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:01.980
 the author the writing 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.780
 I did not like it, I feel like it was too much 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.330
 inadequate or was reading in a 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.130
 paragraph and they were doing I do not know they were 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.800
 At home I travis the o in the next 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.780
 line without leaving a space already 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.480
 they were at the school of the week that 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.549
 I was still then like that suddenly 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.870
 it is deactivated because they are reading the most 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.370
 very well and suddenly you hit the be 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.850
 interned with something else totally 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.950
 different and you stay like that 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.960
 watts at what time software change 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.210
 and I think it's the only detail that 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.550
 I do find , however, its language 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:34.370
 I did not like it if it was these simple 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.650
 no battles we are although they are very 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.690
 explicit already tells you things as they are 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.250
 and two did not stop to say is not that 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:43.280
 this word is very strong you are not going to 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:46.160
 things as they are and I think that 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.710
 it was very good the end I liked in what 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:51.100
 staff very much liked that the end 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.100
 out like this 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:59.860
 and confused you have a relationship of love and 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:02.110
 I hate with this book why why 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.430
 because the book is love and hate then 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.409
 If the book is love and hate too 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.479
 you have a love relationship and it is with the 

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:09.819
 book however the book as I tell them 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:13.629
 It is very good, it makes you feel different 

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:16.210
 emotions from love I hate like that 

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:17.949
 insecurity come moments in which 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.870
 you feel half sad even here what 

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:22.580
 I dialed 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:26.659
 chapter 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:28.789
 chapter 17 chapter the christ over 

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:30.889
 fence to mourn I recommend that where 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:34.580
 will go chapter 17 grab your box 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:36.710
 kings please and it was like he said if the 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.479
 chapter 17 is very sad the same is not true 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:42.260
 repeat it again is a book that I 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:44.930
 I highly recommend it if it's worth reading 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:46.820
 nor should we overestimate how 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:48.380
 I tell you it's not the best book but it 's from 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:50.180
 those books that are worth books 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:53.210
 to which you do not regret having 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:56.510
 read that they are good because that is a 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:58.370
 very good book and then it's all for part 

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:00.680
 of the reviews to have been clear if 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:02.150
 I was not, let me down all those 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.160
