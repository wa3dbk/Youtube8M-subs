00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.069
 hi Guys 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.750
 and I will be watching a video today 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.090
 turn the brush and I tell you 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.960
 explain which pins you for what am 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.839
 best used 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.609
 and that will be the part 1 and 2 it will be 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.300
 later give part 1 is small at first 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:23.580
 its what you face for face so 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.800
 We use makeup and we start 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.140
 first directly to with by dacian pin 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.660
 So I have to say that now 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.130
 that of course you brush every car 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.739
 can use the I will try 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.480
 to thread a bit but is now 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.940
 about as big as you can of course 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.640
 Anyone can always choose from several tests 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.309
 brush for life what you do best 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:47.700
 just want or feel like it but have 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.550
 now first to the actual meaning 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:55.020
 the brush so we now only begin 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:58.170
 paint the foundation and there are 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:02.489
 there are two types as a chimera but two 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:05.250
 species and once these these kabuki 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.710
 brush these are just here in front so 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.340
 that 's just the way it is 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.930
 variant and just so the straight and the 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.140
 There are also in all sizes so here 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:20.549
 looks very big or a little smaller here 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:23.759
 and there's a bit of that, too 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.500
 rounded and these rounded the 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.049
 you can also use it for powder 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.400
 example is a kind of how to stop 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.710
 can apply foundation 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.509
 the other is with such skunk 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.520
 so interest that you brush so here 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.250
 bottom are thicker and above 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.040
 so those who are so thin have less control 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.450
 the takers rose the brush and so on 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.140
 Foundation is also very good 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.329
 use 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:50.549
 So I like to wear these 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:51.659
 weapons here fondation even if you 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.970
 that's just fine 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.930
 the fondation can come first 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.250
 like you too 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.640
 other video always a fondation 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.220
 can see routine and who could with it 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.780
 could halt the better associations 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.670
 simply because that gives it a bit 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.990
 to the finer result by that 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:12.330
 fine hair up here is yes and la 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:15.270
 But you can also do fondation with the 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.250
 wear youtube longer as well as 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:21.630
 now you can also concealer with the 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:26.130
 Beauty men order or concealer 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:29.010
 so they can paint here 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.380
 these are so flat synthetic brushes and 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.870
 they are actually synonymous for foundation 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.520
 thought but I think that is quite 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.050
 difficult there and the fondation 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.120
 apply evenly 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.560
 so stop for concealer 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.730
 my concealer has so applied or 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.590
 also a bit so distributed and 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:50.100
 so what are you holding these thin 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:53.220
 synthetic brush so at foundation and 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.170
 style with this creamy texture and 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.060
 I always find synthetic brushes better 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.459
 suitable because the suck has not so 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.630
 a lot of product on this real peninsula 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.790
 So I say I once briefly 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:07.080
 difference 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:09.450
 So that's right and that's right 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.660
 is just synthetic and is acting like that 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.540
 m but too little plastic stop already 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.850
 wanted a plastic moderately and therefore 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:20.040
 does not take anything from that of the 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:23.370
 product and then there's it again 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:27.000
 smaller brushes so there are now 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:29.100
 water only so and in this 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.690
 foundation dad in small for the 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.320
 concealer so you to have a bit 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.910
 one works but i think i find 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.540
 just the best concealer and 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.160
 foundation 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.980
 it really has the beauty blender though 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:45.120
 this one is apple and yes to that 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:47.940
 the suitable so next we come 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.670
 again and potter you wear 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:53.519
 either as said with this skunk 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:56.790
 also brush or man and half brother 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:57.500
 brush and although there are again 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.220
 various 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.780
 Once there is so accessible then can 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.730
 one stops especially under the eyes or 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.830
 So then apply the brother well or 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.870
 So round classic powder brush 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:12.020
 These are usually a bit bigger for them 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:14.290
 face or indeed something 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:18.440
 narrower and therefore a bit 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:20.150
 the countries of the call of the industry's 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.780
 the goal is the collection of cement 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.710
 chapman 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:27.650
 but that's just son and almost son 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.720
 stinks the brush and many still know 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:33.590
 not what you can find here 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:35.750
 used looks weird so that can 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:38.390
 so you have to use the beautician 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:40.390
 always to divide a mask 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:42.650
 facial mask but if for example 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:43.970
 have a lot of powder applied here 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.950
 her eyes up in her eyes 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:48.400
 then you can do it with the putter 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:51.980
 stop to remove it very well 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:55.550
 yes that is first to brother chancellor and 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:59.120
 from dacian to the boxer and now 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:00.910
 russ and so marry bronson or 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.680
 has contours in the cheeks or 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:07.510
 sleep up on the hairline 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:09.979
 So you just take it that way most of the time 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:12.169
 smaller brush because I can with behind 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:15.169
 to work just so much more precise now 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:17.180
 a bigger brush next to it would be like 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:18.890
 The here then you can just better 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:23.540
 Blend but you can do better 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:25.370
 So wear those round little ones 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:28.910
 brush here they are again 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:30.320
 either real or synthetic or synthetic 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:32.060
 and if so, for example, a creamy one 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.610
 I would rather have bronze like that 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:37.580
 use clear synthetic brushes and 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:40.010
 Here's a nice stop in the forest 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:41.930
 make 1 work and then you can 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:45.500
 of course with which we use 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:47.500
 or with the 1 1 on rainwater 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:50.500
 wear as well as with the bigger one here 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.500
 and 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:57.539
 next to marry 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:58.919
 So I have one of bobby brown the 

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:00.300
 I actually had that was the only one 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:03.330
 with that in my highlight 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:05.580
 applied there is as you see so 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:08.999
 is already quite large so almost as 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:11.309
 similar to his son and powder brush 

00:06:08.999 --> 00:06:13.499
 the truth for these shimmer briggs 

00:06:11.309 --> 00:06:15.659
 This time , and I have it with me 

00:06:13.499 --> 00:06:17.789
 getting married up here 

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:20.309
 but since then I want the technique 

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:23.219
 discovered brush and there it was 

00:06:20.309 --> 00:06:25.139
 such a for marrying or chatting too 

00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:27.330
 this very small and since then I have the 

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:29.310
 I'm really excited about that 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:30.960
 because you can really stop such a thing 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:32.879
 apply a narrow line and 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:36.089
 super nice marry also special 

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:38.460
 the nose and I find much better 

00:06:36.089 --> 00:06:39.650
 suitable as so big but honest too 

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:43.139
 his 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:46.169
 Lastly, I only brushed russ and 

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:48.089
 Although Russian brushes are usually so oblique 

00:06:46.169 --> 00:06:51.270
 rounded because you just so 

00:06:48.089 --> 00:06:52.169
 better stop that can apply since and 

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:55.860
 can use 

00:06:52.169 --> 00:06:57.479
 they are all so obliquely rounded now 

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:59.909
 about the same size a bit 

00:06:57.479 --> 00:07:01.949
 smaller and larger ones actually 

00:06:59.909 --> 00:07:03.180
 that's a matter of taste, too 

00:07:01.949 --> 00:07:05.999
 but wants to wear those are actually 

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:08.370
 all pretty good and has classic rouge 

00:07:05.999 --> 00:07:09.509
 brushing and then I ever got started 

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:11.219
 essens does not catch him 

00:07:09.509 --> 00:07:12.810
 more that and wonder and I find that 

00:07:11.219 --> 00:07:16.949
 especially you have the apple cheeks 

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:19.139
 I want to emphasize also quite good foot yes 

00:07:16.949 --> 00:07:22.469
 hope the video was not too many now 

00:07:19.139 --> 00:07:24.930
 information at once and had now 

00:07:22.469 --> 00:07:27.360
 a little bit more what you think 

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:29.159
 for what can use which brush and 

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:31.439
 yes I hope that we are informative 

00:07:29.159 --> 00:07:34.370
 and was fun and I hope you 

00:07:31.439 --> 00:07:34.370
 switches next time again
