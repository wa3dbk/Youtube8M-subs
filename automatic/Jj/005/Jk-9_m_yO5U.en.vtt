00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:08.280
 hello everyone i'm leo and like to see 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:12.750
 we are at the sixth level of the first world 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:16.279
 super mario and three word and first 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:19.050
 boss first clash with the boozer the 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:25.980
 we immediately enter the castle 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:28.260
 let's see what the proposer then proposes 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.219
 first green star is quite isida 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:37.320
 find you just collect these eight 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:43.829
 coins because the star appears is 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:45.620
 quite is it easy easy peasy we finish 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.059
 in the level 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:51.920
 here we have the opportunity to gather others 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:57.180
 two collectibles we have the stamp e 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:58.969
 another star of course I'm 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:03.559
 dubbing the video in second place 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:06.479
 for a logistical issue that 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:12.750
 we collect some small items 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:15.270
 we know even coins 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.280
 here we have a way to find the last one 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.330
 level star as you can see 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.189
 they are all easy enough to find 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.729
 this is an excellent strategy for 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:30.210
 conquer this without going crazy the 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.970
 just stand still and wait for it 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:38.509
 cannonball do its duty 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.509
 now let's advance to boxing fight 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.920
 really nice 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.390
 then we have two pain in the ass that 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:51.590
 we can remove it very gently this way 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.590
 boy costume is really cool 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:59.080
 and now the 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:07.659
 we come to the collision with the boss we enjoy 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:11.310
 the little film on his modest 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.310
 machine I must say very modest 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.150
 and now the discount for 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:26.800
 defeat him you will just need to raise them 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.800
 balls that throws you 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:34.090
 I must say that as a boss fight I have it 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:38.010
 found particularly long compared 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:40.720
 to the old we say the originals 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:46.900
 which will require more than three or four 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:50.260
 shots to end it even if like 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:53.530
 you can see it's quite easy and easy 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:57.690
 peasy to besiege easy peasy in this 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:03:01.720
 video or wide ball 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:03.340
 is now defeated as you can see the 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.790
 car is starting to lose 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.150
 shots 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:11.530
 now he will start with nothing at all 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:13.660
 so complex as to avoid one thing 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:17.200
 that I love about this new title of 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:19.840
 super mario is that we finally see 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.830
 nintendo have taken advantage of some of the 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.820
 power of mine and graphically indeed 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:30.040
 beautiful and enjoyable 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:32.440
 I really like it so much I find that 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.560
 qualitatively is of the highest quality 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.560
 level 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:46.070
 if it were not that I am geppo 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.070
 I could have already defeated 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:55.560
 what we are now we continue the 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:59.640
 our dodges I risked falling 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:01.170
 out of bravo pirlo I can't 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.810
 throw the balls back 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.560
 I have problems but I am a bit nambo 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:10.910
 boys 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:10.910
 forgive me we're almost there 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:25.200
 bang box destroyed here sucks do not you 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:28.100
 like the bolero exceeds explosion is 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.100
 out of the bar 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.560

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:52.830
