00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:11.820
 so got together here to me 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:14.039
 channel 83 meters new video and in this 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.260
 video I want you the orange 30 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:18.150
 babies or and spit just called 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.730
 Imagine and that is a drying 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.160
 Cloth has a huge size here here 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.720
 Zack can see that part is really 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.210
 big here times my hand or relationship 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.250
 my arm to that is a really 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.700
 gigantic dry it tells me 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.829
 is around 15 to 20 euros and so 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:39.030
 Can a car really great and 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:41.340
 Dry and yes also shorter freedom 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.960
 Of course, this makes everything super important 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.340
 We just like that one 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.540
 bit down here and down 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.440
 Here was even the towel on it 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.090
 here is almost no 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:56.250
 Change moisture more because of this 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:57.180
 Now let's go to this place and 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.540
 we can see we have here of course 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.820
 still a very wet it's still raining 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.649
 a little bit because of that and I 'm leaving now 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.840
 this really not really easy here 

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:10.650
 as good now quite loose just 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.260
 a little bit over and that part 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.970
 take the water like what do I know 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.040
 what to compare with it because 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.110
 there is almost nothing comparable 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.850
 is really gone now for that matter 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.850
 a dry patch of this cloth 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.530
 a little bit over it 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:33.939
 So clearly there is nothing better 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:35.829
 in my opinion in the market for 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:37.420
 hort affected but that is really 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:38.109
 the tuber you see her so small 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.149
 streak 

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:43.659
 that is such a rest too moisture 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:45.729
 as if I'm running here and so short too 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:49.240
 but here in proportion he sees too 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:50.709
 over here right here this 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.140
 dividing line until then I have 

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:54.549
 dried and not here and that is 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.810
 really a huge difference though 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:02:02.110
 We now have the rest of the trunk 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:03.670
 dry area again here and that 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.289
 it really was absolutely dry so 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.270
 the whole thing can wander properly 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:08.110
 slice try on you sometimes 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.329
 look at 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.360
 but I'm really excited about it 

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:12.360
 from 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.770
 we have seen, I have none 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.110
 particular force spent or 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.610
 similar and the whole rhythm fast 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.270
 dry and that was the first 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.860
 passage 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.080
 Of course you take it again 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:33.010
 a small second set the one 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:35.530
 is a bit drier and one more 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.510
 go over it a second time and that's it 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.030
 finish and then the part is also 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:43.200
 I can really clean cleanly 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:47.230
 also like to try to catch 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.989
 So yes this is really super gau so 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.730
 I am more than enthusiastic about the cloth 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:53.319
 and I can only recommend that link to it 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.840
