00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:10.260
 it's adrenaline ensures slalom 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:14.730
 5 km between the trees of the forest of 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.520
 chaumont a course that looks like 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.820
 Russian mountains 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:22.890
 then this ace of the handlebar begs for more 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.980
 the sensations it is exceptional the 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.390
 speed of the technical da it's 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.250
 that this track with thoughts and 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.590
 designed by passionate neutrchists of the 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.420
 mountain bike ride an extreme sport but at 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.309
 canada in the late 90s 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.640
 this descent is one of the most 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.320
 difficult of europe 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.920
 opened three years ago she evolves 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.250
 constantly 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.500
 we'll take a little bit of the pudding 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.269
 are here here we are far from 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.780
 mountain bike route for public resorts 

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:51.330
 ski 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.610
 we wanted to recreate a track with 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:56.820
 a lot of jumps a track anyway 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.170
 a level we can say is expert and 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.530
 what we are looking for is really 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:08.340
 the flight and the length in the air more than 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:09.780
 technical passages or more 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.640
 a hundred jumps mark out 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.460
 today the longest route 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.759
 make up to 15 meters a challenge to the laws 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.759
 of gravity 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.290
 this track crosses a loaned field 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.670
 by the city of NeuchÃ¢tel and the canton 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.470
 she wants to be in harmony with 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.840
 the environment 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.040
 the whole track passes next to the trees 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.710
 that we do not have the right to slaughter 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.479
 big trees we can take small 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:41.820
 15 to make barriers 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.259
 earthworks or like that if it's free 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.299
 riders of each law is passionate about 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.180
 the construction of their tracks these are 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.250
 also lovers of mechanics 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.380
 in his sÃ©bastien studio acid must 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.970
 regularly replace the parts because 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.220
 their lifetime does not exceed 2 years 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.080
 the problem is redo and schÃ¼tz 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.569
 crash case if we land badly on a 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.679
 bump latry too far too short the 

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:03.390
 vassia bikes maybe endure 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:04.979
 constraints for it not to have done 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.960
 it's still mechanics so we have 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.479
 many things that can be hidden 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.420
 this ditch and the driver too can take 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.519
 blows to protect equipment 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.810
 knight of rigor but all 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:17.730
 free riders are not necessarily 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.980
 cautious it is true that the image conveyed 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.260
 through the media very often it's 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.120
 an image where we remove some of the 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.750
 protections or just a tee shirt 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.280
 it's true that young people tend to 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.440
 to copy a bit these images tend 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.280
 to ride that way with the 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.769
 risks that entails 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.670
 for this time 7 is doing well and he 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:37.739
 wanting more 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.019
 the practical side to chaumont is that we 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.269
 can ascend by funicular each 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:46.130
 year this one carries nearly 30,000 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:46.130
 against adrenaline
