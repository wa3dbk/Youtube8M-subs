even though it's a brazilian virgin
brazilian<00:04:39.820> hair<00:04:40.680> it<00:04:41.680> reminds<00:04:42.520> me<00:04:42.580> of<00:04:42.669> life<00:04:43.030> of

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.150 
brazilian hair it reminds me of life of
when<00:04:43.540> i<00:04:43.570> first<00:04:43.960> started<00:04:44.290> wearing<00:04:44.440> weeds<00:04:44.830> when
