method or classic method and basically

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.090 
method or classic method and basically
what<00:00:54.480> happens<00:00:54.809> here<00:00:55.050> is<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.800> wine<00:00:55.949> is

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
what happens here is the wine is

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.069 
what happens here is the wine is
fermented<00:00:56.219> once<00:00:56.640> then<00:00:57.390> put<00:00:57.570> into<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.780> bottle

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
fermented once then put into a bottle

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.709 
fermented once then put into a bottle
where<00:00:58.469> it<00:00:58.530> has<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.680> second<00:00:59.160> fermentation<00:00:59.719> so

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
where it has a second fermentation so

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.119 
where it has a second fermentation so
all<00:01:00.870> those<00:01:01.050> bubbles<00:01:01.379> are<00:01:01.530> trapped<00:01:01.800> within<00:01:02.010> the

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
all those bubbles are trapped within the

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.770 
all those bubbles are trapped within the
bottle<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.640> so<00:01:03.149> you're<00:01:03.329> going<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.510> get<00:01:03.600> more

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
bottle and so you're going to get more

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.960 
bottle and so you're going to get more
of<00:01:03.899> like<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.049> vigorously<00:01:04.710> sparkling<00:01:05.220> wine<00:01:05.400> then

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970

Prosecco<00:01:49.170> coming<00:01:49.799> from<00:01:49.950> Italy<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.729> this<00:01:51.390> is

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:51.539 
Prosecco coming from Italy and this is

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:53.690 
Prosecco coming from Italy and this is
from<00:01:51.689> northeastern<00:01:52.259> Italy<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.710> grape

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
from northeastern Italy and the grape

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.760 
from northeastern Italy and the grape
here<00:01:53.880> is<00:01:53.969> galera<00:01:54.390> now<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.079> Prosecco<00:01:55.409> method

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
here is galera now the Prosecco method

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.050 
here is galera now the Prosecco method
is<00:01:55.890> different<00:01:56.009> from<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.399> champagne<00:01:56.729> method

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
is different from the champagne method

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.359 
is different from the champagne method
because<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.840> secondary<00:01:58.350> fermentation<00:01:58.590> that

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
because the secondary fermentation that

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.190 
because the secondary fermentation that
happen<00:01:59.640> in<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.789> bottle<00:02:00.119> on<00:02:00.329> champagne

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
happen in the bottle on champagne

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.550 
happen in the bottle on champagne
happens<00:02:02.189> in<00:02:02.369> a<00:02:02.460> big<00:02:02.670> giant<00:02:03.090> tank<00:02:03.810> so<00:02:04.530> the

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
happens in a big giant tank so the

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.340 
happens in a big giant tank so the
bubbles<00:02:05.039> are<00:02:05.280> less<00:02:05.729> tight<00:02:06.420> less<00:02:07.110> tightly

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
bubbles are less tight less tightly

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.680 
bubbles are less tight less tightly

find mostly in France but you're seeing
it<00:02:46.890> in<00:02:47.129> California<00:02:47.910> and<00:02:48.299> Italy<00:02:48.959> it's<00:02:49.230> really

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
it in California and Italy it's really

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.740 
it in California and Italy it's really
becoming<00:02:49.769> quite<00:02:50.040> a<00:02:50.069> thing<00:02:50.310> and<00:02:50.549> it's<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:51.329> og

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
becoming quite a thing and it's the og

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.680 
becoming quite a thing and it's the og
way<00:02:51.959> of<00:02:52.139> making<00:02:52.470> sparkling<00:02:52.920> wine<00:02:53.569> that's<00:02:54.569> what

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
way of making sparkling wine that's what

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.390 
way of making sparkling wine that's what
they<00:02:54.750> call<00:02:54.930> it<00:02:54.989> method<00:02:55.290> ancestral<00:02:55.889> as<00:02:56.190> well

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
they call it method ancestral as well

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.479 
they call it method ancestral as well
and<00:02:57.440> everything<00:02:58.440> happens<00:02:58.859> in<00:02:59.010> this<00:02:59.160> bottle

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
and everything happens in this bottle

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.479 
and everything happens in this bottle
yeah<00:02:59.819> so<00:03:00.200> the<00:03:01.200> fermentation<00:03:01.889> starts<00:03:02.100> with<00:03:02.370> the

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
yeah so the fermentation starts with the

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.910 
yeah so the fermentation starts with the
wine<00:03:02.670> and<00:03:03.030> then<00:03:03.239> before<00:03:03.630> it's<00:03:03.750> finished<00:03:03.959> you

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
wine and then before it's finished you

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.860 
wine and then before it's finished you
put<00:03:05.130> it<00:03:05.220> into<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.430> bottle<00:03:05.549> and<00:03:05.850> so<00:03:06.420> you're<00:03:06.780> not

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
put it into the bottle and so you're not

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.020 
put it into the bottle and so you're not
getting<00:03:07.139> any<00:03:07.290> disgorgement<00:03:07.709> oh<00:03:08.250> the<00:03:08.609> sediment

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
getting any disgorgement oh the sediment

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.280 
getting any disgorgement oh the sediment
stays<00:03:09.239> in<00:03:09.389> the<00:03:09.480> bottle<00:03:09.810> that's<00:03:09.989> why<00:03:10.170> they're

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
stays in the bottle that's why they're

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.660 
stays in the bottle that's why they're
usually<00:03:10.440> a<00:03:10.590> little<00:03:10.620> bit<00:03:10.829> more<00:03:10.950> cloudy<00:03:11.250> and

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
usually a little bit more cloudy and

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.479 
usually a little bit more cloudy and
because<00:03:12.299> the<00:03:12.480> fermentations<00:03:13.049> wild<00:03:13.530> no<00:03:14.280> sugar

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
because the fermentations wild no sugar

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.190 
because the fermentations wild no sugar
is<00:03:14.639> being<00:03:14.849> added<00:03:15.000> no<00:03:15.329> sugar<00:03:15.660> and<00:03:15.780> Easter<00:03:16.019> being

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
is being added no sugar and Easter being

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.300 
is being added no sugar and Easter being
added<00:03:16.440> to<00:03:16.590> start<00:03:16.799> the<00:03:16.920> secondary

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
added to start the secondary

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.920 
added to start the secondary
fermentation<00:03:17.549> sometimes<00:03:18.540> with<00:03:18.690> little

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
fermentation sometimes with little

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.509 
fermentation sometimes with little
sweeter<00:03:19.139> sometimes<00:03:19.620> it's<00:03:19.769> a<00:03:19.829> little<00:03:19.859> drier<00:03:20.310> as

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
sweeter sometimes it's a little drier as

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:21.650 
sweeter sometimes it's a little drier as
a<00:03:20.549> little<00:03:20.760> unexpected<00:03:20.940> you<00:03:21.359> don't<00:03:21.510> know<00:03:21.569> what
