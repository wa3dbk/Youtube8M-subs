to get some shells into that face max

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.490 
to get some shells into that face max
might<00:00:34.150> be<00:00:34.300> easier<00:00:34.660> with<00:00:34.840> more<00:00:34.990> accurate

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:35.500 
might be easier with more accurate

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.470 
might be easier with more accurate
single-shot<00:00:36.010> weapons<00:00:36.070> but<00:00:37.060> I've<00:00:37.180> been<00:00:37.300> using

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.480 
single-shot weapons but I've been using

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.350 
single-shot weapons but I've been using
a<00:00:37.660> shotgun<00:00:37.900> so<00:00:38.500> he<00:00:39.250> came<00:00:39.400> he<00:00:39.670> came<00:00:39.850> up<00:00:40.000> close<00:00:40.180> to

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.360 
a shotgun so he came he came up close to

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.880 
a shotgun so he came he came up close to
me<00:00:40.480> in<00:00:40.600> the<00:00:40.690> window<00:00:40.990> the<00:00:41.410> only<00:00:41.590> thing<00:00:41.710> you<00:00:41.800> have

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
me in the window the only thing you have

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.860 
me in the window the only thing you have
to<00:00:41.920> worry<00:00:42.070> about<00:00:42.340> though<00:00:42.520> is<00:00:42.670> that<00:00:42.880> he<00:00:43.330> also

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
to worry about though is that he also

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.570 
to worry about though is that he also
has<00:00:44.260> a<00:00:44.290> shotgun<00:00:44.620> and<00:00:44.920> he's<00:00:45.070> probably<00:00:45.310> like<00:00:45.550> a

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:45.580 
has a shotgun and he's probably like a

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.460 
has a shotgun and he's probably like a
two-shot<00:00:46.090> kill<00:00:46.120> so<00:00:46.630> he'll<00:00:46.870> knock<00:00:47.200> your<00:00:47.440> ass

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:47.470 
two-shot kill so he'll knock your ass

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.710 
two-shot kill so he'll knock your ass
out<00:00:47.800> if<00:00:47.950> you're<00:00:48.070> not<00:00:48.100> careful<00:00:48.220> and<00:00:48.820> let's<00:00:49.570> go

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:49.720 
out if you're not careful and let's go

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.060

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.110 
black blast shield that he's got on
that's<00:00:59.560> going<00:00:59.740> to<00:00:59.800> take<00:00:59.980> maybe<00:01:00.160> three<00:01:00.280> four

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
that's going to take maybe three four

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.940 
that's going to take maybe three four
shotgun<00:01:01.780> shells<00:01:02.050> to<00:01:02.170> take<00:01:02.350> out<00:01:02.530> you<00:01:02.650> can<00:01:02.800> see

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:02.950 
shotgun shells to take out you can see

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.439 
shotgun shells to take out you can see
how<00:01:02.980> it's<00:01:03.220> getting<00:01:03.340> dented<00:01:03.790> with<00:01:03.910> every<00:01:04.180> shot

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
how it's getting dented with every shot

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:06.929 
how it's getting dented with every shot
and<00:01:04.720> as<00:01:05.530> you<00:01:06.040> break<00:01:06.310> it<00:01:06.460> down<00:01:06.640> there's<00:01:06.850> gonna

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:06.939 
and as you break it down there's gonna

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:08.850 
and as you break it down there's gonna
be<00:01:07.119> a<00:01:07.150> silver<00:01:07.630> one<00:01:07.960> underneath<00:01:08.259> and<00:01:08.590> here<00:01:08.799> I

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
be a silver one underneath and here I

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.890 
be a silver one underneath and here I
believe<00:01:09.250> I<00:01:09.310> break<00:01:09.759> it<00:01:09.939> yep<00:01:10.299> there<00:01:10.540> it<00:01:10.630> is<00:01:10.720> now

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 
believe I break it yep there it is now

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.390 
believe I break it yep there it is now
there's<00:01:11.110> a<00:01:11.170> silver<00:01:11.470> one<00:01:11.770> underneath<00:01:12.070> that

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:12.400 
there's a silver one underneath that

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.220 
there's a silver one underneath that
that's<00:01:12.850> going<00:01:13.030> to<00:01:13.090> take<00:01:13.180> like<00:01:13.510> another<00:01:13.930> few

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:14.230 
that's going to take like another few

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.560 
that's going to take like another few
shots<00:01:14.470> into<00:01:14.860> it<00:01:14.980> a<00:01:15.100> little<00:01:15.940> bit<00:01:16.120> tough<00:01:16.540> to

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
shots into it a little bit tough to

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.110 
shots into it a little bit tough to
break<00:01:17.050> and<00:01:17.380> kind<00:01:18.370> of<00:01:18.430> tough<00:01:18.610> you<00:01:18.700> see<00:01:18.880> how<00:01:19.000> this

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:19.120 
break and kind of tough you see how this

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.880 
break and kind of tough you see how this
one<00:01:19.300> got<00:01:19.510> dented<00:01:19.810> a<00:01:19.870> lot<00:01:20.050> faster<00:01:20.590> though<00:01:20.710> it's

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
one got dented a lot faster though it's

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.580 
one got dented a lot faster though it's
a<00:01:20.950> lot<00:01:21.250> weaker<00:01:21.640> and<00:01:22.000> then<00:01:22.360> there<00:01:22.780> there<00:01:23.260> goes

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
a lot weaker and then there there goes

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.440 
a lot weaker and then there there goes
his<00:01:23.800> facemask<00:01:24.100> now<00:01:24.670> he's<00:01:24.970> ready<00:01:25.210> for<00:01:25.300> a

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
his facemask now he's ready for a

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.870 
his facemask now he's ready for a
one-shot<00:01:25.930> kill<00:01:25.960> to<00:01:26.409> the<00:01:26.440> head<00:01:26.710> all<00:01:27.430> you<00:01:27.760> have

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
one-shot kill to the head all you have

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.330 
one-shot kill to the head all you have
to<00:01:28.000> do<00:01:28.150> is<00:01:28.390> focus<00:01:29.140> on<00:01:29.409> hitting<00:01:29.620> that<00:01:29.860> face<00:01:30.100> mask

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
to do is focus on hitting that face mask

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.330 
to do is focus on hitting that face mask
once<00:01:30.880> that<00:01:31.060> face<00:01:31.300> mask<00:01:31.510> breaks<00:01:31.900> down<00:01:32.190> break<00:01:33.190> it

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
once that face mask breaks down break it

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.250 
once that face mask breaks down break it
one<00:01:33.580> more<00:01:33.790> time<00:01:34.060> because<00:01:34.720> it's<00:01:34.870> a<00:01:34.960> weaker

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:35.260 
one more time because it's a weaker

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.380 
one more time because it's a weaker
version<00:01:35.680> and<00:01:35.860> then<00:01:36.280> headshot<00:01:36.760> him<00:01:36.880> and<00:01:37.060> then

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
version and then headshot him and then

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.380 
version and then headshot him and then
he's<00:01:37.540> done<00:01:37.750> you<00:01:38.020> don't<00:01:38.170> have<00:01:38.290> to<00:01:38.380> put<00:01:38.620> 75

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
he's done you don't have to put 75

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.940 
he's done you don't have to put 75
bullets<00:01:40.390> into<00:01:40.630> his<00:01:40.750> body<00:01:40.960> then<00:01:41.290> you<00:01:41.620> just<00:01:41.800> have

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
bullets into his body then you just have
