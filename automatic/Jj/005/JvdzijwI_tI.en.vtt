00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.809
 speaks guys welcome to another video 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.309
 budget here on the channel and 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:16.030
 many requests from you there 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:17.740
 comments 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:20.260
 Today I'm going to make a cheap pc for 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.000
 play more craft of course not only for 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.010
 play bigger craft he will give to play 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.040
 other games that do not have much graphic 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:29.170
 such as the pot blanc crossfire 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.610
 league of legends among others 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.550
 then proceed with the components 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:36.969
 chosen for this setting 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.829
 processor is e3 4151 from al khor per 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:41.200
 it has four threads which makes it 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:44.200
 it works in practice with a quad core 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:47.320
 default clock is garrett 3.5 in 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.720
 three cash tdp tables of 54 Watte the 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.329
 Socket it already 50 membrane that 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.610
 covers the processor box already comes with 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:57.160
 Nezinho to be able to cool it beyond 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.930
 also the thermal paste already applied in 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.970
 quantity the average price that 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.269
 I found it was 3 60 reais and now 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:07.899
 Let's talk about the chosen motherboard. 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:09.909
 plate model AJOC h 81m HDS socket 

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:13.030
 religion and logic to power 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:15.640
 support the e3 chipset intel h81 from 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.430
 memory it supports ddr3 of up to 1,600 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.280
 megasex as the maximum 16 gigas already comes 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.290
 with usb 3.0 front connector and price 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.970
 her average was 220 reais 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.430
 remembering that in the lower right corner 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.140
 to its current bad of components that in this 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.600
 if you have 580 reais 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.080
 the memory is only put the chosen 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:37.420
 Ilsinho 4GB preserve the clock 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.950
 1333 MHz and how this setting is 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.780
 only to run lightweight games and 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.610
 especially the minecraft I chose only 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.409
 put 4 gb of memory that already 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.939
 enough to run the game each country 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:47.619
 60 percent neighbor and fifty 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:50.020
 five reais and we're going to the next 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.939
 component hd is the zircon pattern of 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.560
 500- gigabyte seagate that already 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:55.630
 enough to store our games 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.670
 do not have much to talk about hd and hd is 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.500
 standard the average price of it is one hundred and 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.600
 eighty-five reais and now I'm going to speak 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.340
 about cabinet chosen cabinet 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.670
 here is a new feature on the 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.979
 brand vini that powerful lighting 2.0 vx 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.200
 it is standard atx what this means is 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.299
 that the source is placed on top 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.890
 the cabinet not on the bottom as it is 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:16.000
 Recommended for a gamer pc 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.800
 but as in this case 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.240
 if it is not considered the game for not 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.740
 run heavy games 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.840
 I chose to put this cabinet there with 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.980
 the source at the top even because the 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.480
 our video card the others 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.820
 components will not get very hot 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.190
 so it will not mess up much in the flow 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:33.250
 air will not heat up inside the 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.680
 front side we have a sb 3.0 other usb 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.610
 2.0 in addition to the headphone and 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.620
 microphone 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.080
 the average price I found was 90 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.360
 prices at a very good price and despite the 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.820
 cabinet limitations and will attend because 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.990
 we want in this configuration the board 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.590
 chosen for your setup 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:53.430
 it is an energy of having 730 places it of 700 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:57.340
 megahertz 96 cuda colors 2gb memory 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:00.220
 gddr3 with 128-bit interface and clock 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.780
 of memory of one thousand 400 mhz is a 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.850
 video entry for who wants to shoot 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.739
 for simple games and also view 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.440
 some videos and higher resolutions 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:10.270
 not recommended for heavy games by 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.980
 in this configuration I chose this 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.989
 video card because like most of 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.510
 You know, minecraft is not a game that 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:18.160
 you need so much video card and you 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.780
 invest a lot of money on 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.239
 video only to play minecraft and 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.370
 other games with similar graphics you 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.910
 is going to invest very large 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:31.750
 also could have put the r7 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:35.200
 240 or even r7 250 ddr3 that would not 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:37.330
 modify much more I chose cgt 730 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.940
 because it has little heat emission 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.480
 its average price is in the range of 280 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.400
 real 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.690
 now it's just the source of milk to close 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.100
 our budget 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.680
 so people like our setup 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.750
 It does not require much energy I 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.239
 I chose to put a spoon more elite 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.370
 power of 350 watts real 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:56.260
 any real thing above 350 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.150
 watts would already support your configuration 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.579
 but I put this on the cooler master 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:03.040
 to know the quality already demonstrated 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:04.870
 p 6 with this source and there I recommend 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.100
 for those who want to do the 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.579
 upgrade put a video card 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.739
 best 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:10.780
 I recommend getting a few xx and almost 30 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:12.310
 watts at least the characteristics there 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.739
 You see that she does not even have a 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:17.049
 6 pin pci express connector for 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:18.489
 put on the video card but like 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.769
 our video card does not have this 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.609
 connector in case this configuration is not 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.620
 will need 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.430
 the average price of this source is per cent 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.949
 and thirty reais 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.539
 it's a bit difficult to find on the market and only 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:30.490
 so as an alternative 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:32.320
 you can put any one source 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.810
 there in the range of that price and that 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.520
 labeled power and at least 350 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.680
 real watts 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.330
 This is it folks, we close the 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.280
 Today's budget I hope you have 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.780
 liked the new style of video does not 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.940
 I know if you can understand but now I am 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.220
 speaking - characteristics to make a 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.919
 video faster and more dynamic because 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.600
 the focus of the channel is not to be technical but to 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:54.190
 to help the crew set up a 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.560
 configuration according to the 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:58.810
 needs of the person without spending much 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:01.270
 money into other components and 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.979
 nonsense that 's what a lot of people do 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.050
 If you liked this video I ask you to 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:07.240
 you leave your jewelry that it helps 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.039
 quite the channel to grow also 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.960
 sign up if you have not been signed up 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:12.460
 suggestions put in the comments 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.830
 because I always answer the crowd there 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.840
 asking to make the budget then 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.550
 you have any suggestions or price 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.380
 even setting puts down 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:23.759
 of the comments was this guys a 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:23.759
 hug and I went
