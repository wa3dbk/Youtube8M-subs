trail<00:02:20.560> and<00:02:20.680> present<00:02:21.070> mind<00:02:21.220> great<00:02:21.490> where<00:02:21.910> the

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
trail and present mind great where the

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.860 
trail and present mind great where the
grass<00:02:22.330> is<00:02:22.360> actually<00:02:22.960> quite<00:02:23.170> high<00:02:24.210> but<00:02:25.210> but<00:02:25.720> the

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
grass is actually quite high but but the

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.420 
grass is actually quite high but but the
conditions<00:02:26.380> of<00:02:26.470> the<00:02:26.530> trail<00:02:26.800> like<00:02:26.980> the<00:02:27.100> tread

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
conditions of the trail like the tread

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.610 
conditions of the trail like the tread
they're<00:02:27.880> not<00:02:28.060> dusty<00:02:28.720> they're<00:02:29.170> in<00:02:29.290> great<00:02:29.470> shape

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
they're not dusty they're in great shape

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.070 
they're not dusty they're in great shape
just<00:02:30.460> make<00:02:30.670> sure<00:02:30.700> watch<00:02:31.090> out<00:02:31.300> for<00:02:31.540> rocks<00:02:31.780> and

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
just make sure watch out for rocks and

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.740 
just make sure watch out for rocks and
not<00:02:32.200> roll<00:02:32.440> my<00:02:32.590> ankle<00:02:32.980> and<00:02:33.420> that's<00:02:34.420> all<00:02:34.600> just

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
not roll my ankle and that's all just

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.540 
not roll my ankle and that's all just
getting<00:02:35.050> down<00:02:35.140> safely<00:02:35.470> these<00:02:36.100> are<00:02:36.250> down<00:02:36.400> how

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
getting down safely these are down how

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.220 
getting down safely these are down how
just<00:02:36.790> try<00:02:37.060> to<00:02:37.120> tell<00:02:37.330> myself<00:02:37.420> to<00:02:37.660> keep<00:02:37.870> take

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
just try to tell myself to keep take

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.730 
just try to tell myself to keep take
good<00:02:38.410> steps<00:02:38.710> i<00:02:39.450> go<00:02:40.450> i<00:02:40.870> probably<00:02:41.230> don't<00:02:41.410> go<00:02:41.590> as

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
good steps i go i probably don't go as

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.740 
good steps i go i probably don't go as
fast<00:02:41.920> as<00:02:42.220> you<00:02:42.400> know<00:02:42.580> as<00:02:42.820> I<00:02:43.120> should<00:02:43.390> or<00:02:43.570> could

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
fast as you know as I should or could

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.240 
fast as you know as I should or could
but<00:02:44.050> I<00:02:44.170> go<00:02:44.380> probably<00:02:44.680> bout<00:02:44.860> ninety<00:02:45.100> to

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
but I go probably bout ninety to

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.620 
but I go probably bout ninety to
ninety-five<00:02:45.580> percent<00:02:45.850> and<00:02:46.210> this<00:02:46.300> take<00:02:46.600> good

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
ninety-five percent and this take good

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.060 
ninety-five percent and this take good
step<00:02:47.020> so<00:02:47.260> that<00:02:47.290> way<00:02:47.560> I<00:02:47.590> don't<00:02:47.710> have<00:02:47.830> any

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
step so that way I don't have any

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:49.860 
step so that way I don't have any
accidents<00:02:48.370> I<00:02:48.760> think<00:02:49.210> basically<00:02:49.360> he's<00:02:49.690> just

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
accidents I think basically he's just

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.420 
accidents I think basically he's just
practicing<00:02:50.050> running<00:02:50.650> downhill<00:02:50.830> on<00:02:51.130> tour<00:02:51.310> else

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
practicing running downhill on tour else

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.860 
practicing running downhill on tour else
and<00:02:51.790> you<00:02:51.910> get<00:02:52.300> better<00:02:52.450> at<00:02:52.540> it<00:02:52.690> and<00:02:53.250> quick<00:02:54.250> steps

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
and you get better at it and quick steps

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.650 
and you get better at it and quick steps
shorts<00:02:55.870> quick<00:02:56.260> steps<00:02:56.590> and<00:02:57.239> don't<00:02:58.239> try<00:02:58.360> to<00:02:58.420> slow

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
shorts quick steps and don't try to slow

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:09.830 
shorts quick steps and don't try to slow
yourself<00:02:58.750> down

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.170 

it<00:03:10.840> was<00:03:10.990> actually<00:03:11.380> a<00:03:11.410> pretty<00:03:11.680> good<00:03:12.180> gradual

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
it was actually a pretty good gradual

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.310 
it was actually a pretty good gradual
cruzi<00:03:14.050> run<00:03:15.120> the<00:03:16.120> climb<00:03:16.330> is<00:03:16.810> pretty<00:03:17.140> consistent

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
cruzi run the climb is pretty consistent

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.980 
cruzi run the climb is pretty consistent
until<00:03:18.160> you<00:03:18.250> get<00:03:18.370> up<00:03:18.490> to<00:03:18.700> Jupiter<00:03:19.360> team<00:03:19.540> and<00:03:19.870> I

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:19.990 
until you get up to Jupiter team and I

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:21.390 
until you get up to Jupiter team and I
was<00:03:20.110> pretty<00:03:20.260> surprised<00:03:20.620> about<00:03:20.920> that<00:03:20.980> it

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
was pretty surprised about that it

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.490 
was pretty surprised about that it
wasn't<00:03:21.670> expecting<00:03:22.180> quite<00:03:22.810> that's<00:03:23.080> people<00:03:23.410> who

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
wasn't expecting quite that's people who

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.830 
wasn't expecting quite that's people who
climb<00:03:23.710> after<00:03:24.190> so<00:03:24.400> much<00:03:24.550> gradual<00:03:25.060> uphill<00:03:25.390> so

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
climb after so much gradual uphill so

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.020 
climb after so much gradual uphill so
that<00:03:25.990> was<00:03:26.140> fun<00:03:26.350> you<00:03:26.580> definitely<00:03:27.580> have<00:03:27.730> to<00:03:27.760> just

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
that was fun you definitely have to just

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.240 
that was fun you definitely have to just
kind<00:03:28.210> of<00:03:28.240> take<00:03:28.450> it<00:03:28.570> down<00:03:28.720> a<00:03:28.750> notch<00:03:29.050> and<00:03:29.290> do<00:03:29.920> much

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
kind of take it down a notch and do much

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.890 
kind of take it down a notch and do much
more<00:03:30.460> hiking<00:03:30.730> than<00:03:31.030> actual<00:03:31.270> running<00:03:31.600> I

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
more hiking than actual running I

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.810 
more hiking than actual running I
haven't<00:03:32.440> been<00:03:32.530> running<00:03:32.980> that<00:03:33.160> much<00:03:33.430> I've<00:03:33.640> kind

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
haven't been running that much I've kind

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.940 
haven't been running that much I've kind
of<00:03:33.880> had<00:03:34.000> an<00:03:34.150> off<00:03:34.450> season<00:03:34.780> this<00:03:35.080> year<00:03:35.140> and<00:03:35.530> so

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
of had an off season this year and so

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.490 
of had an off season this year and so
it's<00:03:36.250> kind<00:03:36.430> of<00:03:36.520> nice<00:03:36.700> to<00:03:36.760> come<00:03:37.120> out<00:03:37.270> and<00:03:37.480> have<00:03:38.470> a

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
it's kind of nice to come out and have a

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.810 
it's kind of nice to come out and have a
good<00:03:38.590> performance<00:03:39.220> I<00:03:39.340> didn't<00:03:39.520> really<00:03:39.640> know

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
good performance I didn't really know

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.300 
good performance I didn't really know
what<00:03:40.060> to<00:03:40.240> expect<00:03:40.390> the<00:03:41.110> first<00:03:41.320> climb<00:03:41.770> a<00:03:41.800> lot<00:03:42.220> of

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
what to expect the first climb a lot of

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.960 
what to expect the first climb a lot of
the<00:03:42.430> strong<00:03:42.760> guys<00:03:43.030> kind<00:03:43.720> of<00:03:44.100> I<00:03:45.100> guess<00:03:45.580> we're

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
the strong guys kind of I guess we're

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.910 
the strong guys kind of I guess we're
tentative<00:03:46.420> some<00:03:47.080> of<00:03:47.200> them<00:03:47.260> were<00:03:47.410> coming<00:03:47.770> from

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
tentative some of them were coming from

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.670 
tentative some of them were coming from
low<00:03:48.130> altitude<00:03:48.610> to<00:03:48.760> high<00:03:48.880> altitude<00:03:49.390> and<00:03:49.990> I'd

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
low altitude to high altitude and I'd

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.050 
low altitude to high altitude and I'd
been<00:03:50.860> out<00:03:50.980> here<00:03:51.130> for<00:03:51.340> a<00:03:51.370> couple<00:03:51.550> weeks<00:03:51.700> I<00:03:52.030> think

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
been out here for a couple weeks I think

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.430 
been out here for a couple weeks I think
it<00:03:52.300> gave<00:03:52.390> me<00:03:52.570> a<00:03:52.600> little<00:03:52.780> bit<00:03:52.930> of<00:03:53.050> an<00:03:53.140> advantage

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
it gave me a little bit of an advantage

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.950 
it gave me a little bit of an advantage
the<00:03:54.070> downhill<00:03:54.610> is<00:03:54.910> like<00:03:55.150> the<00:03:55.300> uphill<00:03:55.690> for<00:03:55.840> the

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:55.960 
the downhill is like the uphill for the

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.480 
the downhill is like the uphill for the
most<00:03:56.110> part<00:03:56.290> nice<00:03:56.530> and<00:03:56.740> crazy<00:03:56.980> downhill

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:57.490 
most part nice and crazy downhill

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:00.420
