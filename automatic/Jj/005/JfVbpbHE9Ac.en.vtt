00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
running around with a gun like this my

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.520 
running around with a gun like this my
buddy<00:03:14.910> compared<00:03:15.690> it<00:03:15.810> to<00:03:15.840> i<00:03:15.930> think<00:03:16.170> what<00:03:16.319> was<00:03:16.380> it

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
buddy compared it to i think what was it

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.440 
buddy compared it to i think what was it
the<00:03:16.650> g3<00:03:17.459> or<00:03:17.489> whatever<00:03:17.819> the<00:03:17.940> hell<00:03:18.060> it's<00:03:18.209> called

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
the g3 or whatever the hell it's called

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.630 
the g3 or whatever the hell it's called
from<00:03:18.840> you<00:03:19.290> know<00:03:19.410> cod4<00:03:19.859> running<00:03:20.190> around<00:03:20.459> but

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
from you know cod4 running around but

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.880 
from you know cod4 running around but
it's<00:03:20.790> like<00:03:20.940> a<00:03:21.120> one-shot<00:03:21.870> kill<00:03:22.140> almost<00:03:22.320> every

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
it's like a one-shot kill almost every

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.229 
it's like a one-shot kill almost every
time<00:03:23.070> i<00:03:23.100> use<00:03:23.370> it<00:03:23.489> now<00:03:23.579> this<00:03:23.730> game<00:03:23.880> wasn't<00:03:24.090> the

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
time i use it now this game wasn't the

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.390 
time i use it now this game wasn't the
best<00:03:24.359> example<00:03:24.870> for<00:03:24.900> that<00:03:25.200> because<00:03:25.890> when<00:03:26.250> i<00:03:26.310> was

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
best example for that because when i was

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.430 
best example for that because when i was
running<00:03:26.579> around<00:03:26.790> with<00:03:27.120> it<00:03:27.329> i<00:03:27.510> think<00:03:28.260> i<00:03:28.320> got

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
running around with it i think i got

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.900 
running around with it i think i got
three<00:03:28.769> maybe<00:03:29.040> four<00:03:29.250> hit<00:03:29.430> markers<00:03:29.700> in<00:03:29.790> this

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
three maybe four hit markers in this

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.789 
three maybe four hit markers in this
game<00:03:30.060> whereas<00:03:30.480> in<00:03:30.840> it<00:03:31.109> that's<00:03:31.380> more<00:03:31.590> hip

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
game whereas in it that's more hip

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:33.140 
game whereas in it that's more hip

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:48.830 
obviously unless he's across the map or

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:50.199 
obviously unless he's across the map or
something<00:06:48.979> you<00:06:49.249> don't<00:06:49.429> technically<00:06:49.849> have<00:06:50.059> to

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:50.209 
something you don't technically have to

00:06:50.209 --> 00:06:53.529

00:06:55.059 --> 00:06:55.069 
situation but then there's one where I

00:06:55.069 --> 00:06:56.979 
situation but then there's one where I
think<00:06:55.369> that<00:06:55.489> if<00:06:55.639> you<00:06:55.939> walk<00:06:56.149> across<00:06:56.300> any<00:06:56.749> gun

00:06:56.979 --> 00:06:56.989 
think that if you walk across any gun

00:06:56.989 --> 00:06:58.089 
think that if you walk across any gun
I'm<00:06:57.110> thinking<00:06:57.319> of<00:06:57.409> making<00:06:57.499> you<00:06:57.649> know<00:06:57.769> certain

00:06:58.089 --> 00:06:58.099 
I'm thinking of making you know certain

00:06:58.099 --> 00:07:00.790 
I'm thinking of making you know certain
roles<00:06:58.369> where<00:06:58.699> like<00:06:58.939> pure<00:06:59.269> like<00:06:59.800> littered

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:00.800 
roles where like pure like littered

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.139 
roles where like pure like littered
bugging<00:07:01.099> where<00:07:01.249> you<00:07:01.369> walk<00:07:01.550> across<00:07:01.669> any<00:07:01.999> on

00:07:02.139 --> 00:07:02.149 
bugging where you walk across any on

00:07:02.149 --> 00:07:03.519 
bugging where you walk across any on
where's<00:07:02.360> friendlies<00:07:02.719> old<00:07:02.959> gun<00:07:03.139> handgun

second chance anything you gotta pick it

00:07:05.569 --> 00:07:07.749 
second chance anything you gotta pick it
up<00:07:05.689> so<00:07:05.869> it's<00:07:05.989> not<00:07:06.139> like<00:07:06.379> anything<00:07:07.339> you<00:07:07.610> gotta

00:07:07.749 --> 00:07:07.759 
up so it's not like anything you gotta

up so it's not like anything you gotta
you<00:07:07.939> gotta<00:07:08.089> stick<00:07:08.269> to<00:07:08.419> the<00:07:08.509> rules<00:07:08.659> so<00:07:09.019> you<00:07:09.589> know
