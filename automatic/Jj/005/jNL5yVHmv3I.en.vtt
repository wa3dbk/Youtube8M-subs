 pisapia reached thanks for accepting our invitation but pula hellas verona 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:16.930
 the Achaeans and wanted to ask I wanted to ask since I can't 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.570
 absolutely give no responsibility for what was 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:20.439
 the past 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:25.140
 I wanted to ask which and to what perspective I could sing about these houses 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.460
 it was popular as they intend to move I spoke with clear 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.760
 not even clear toll-booths because the inter is responsible 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.850
 to the press office of the alliance 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.030
 acuire ottimo restaurant bele casel- xp 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.680
 for those in Milan and you tell me that I am not home and sometimes vacant homes but 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.539
 are cases of practicability since many are not up to standard then the problem is 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:48.190
 this 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:49.400
 homes 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.200
 since 2009 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.940
 to date those that have been freed from 2009 to today 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.179
 the writings of art are the responsibility of the law 

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:01.179
 of the aler must be replaced 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.950
 before 2009 because you have me there are empty houses from before 2000 is not 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.950
 they must be put in place by us from the department of public works then 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.360
 First of all the objectives of this bathroom department we will meet again late here 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.940
 at 6 months a year and I hope I will take the term back to him 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.689
 mention tomorrow therefore and that of starting with an operation of 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.979
 Restructuring of these papers then I repeat some to the lens 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.470
 we gave 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.530
 10 million euros a year to do this so now I only have to 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.250
 check that it does 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.580
 therefore or out I hope that the aler replaces 500 accommodations from today up 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.450
 to May 2012 because the money to do this is an allocation cm 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.570
 the housing case is different 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:55.660
 the oldest ones written by first and 2009 I kontor to repair myself by May 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.950
 2012 at least a thousand traits in this wind of the Aler that 500c facade a 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.120
 load of alloy 500 charged 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.749
 in the common of this me 

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:10.450
 I am committed to doing it racks we will proceed own the splitting by breaking down the 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.730
 myspace problems by dialing into neighborhoods and looking right if you want to watch 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.019
 this map 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:18.679
 compose 

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:21.919
 small problems and let's start with the individual neighborhoods 

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:24.979
 the steps to do are the following 

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:26.339
 on one side 

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:29.790
 just gallop on the restoration of vacant houses 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:31.799
 secondly 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:36.569
 for you to set up this commission foreseen by the regional regulation r 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:41.499
 evaluate all abusive occupants and distinguish the abusive needy from 

00:02:41.499 --> 00:02:44.260
 abusive delinquent losses to understand us 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.890
 the abusive need to take charge of social services and find the 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:48.620
 Lodging 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.380
 the abusive offender instead put him out of the house all our and then free 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:53.629
 of other accommodations 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:58.010
 I also seemed to understand that there is a different connotation for what 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.559
 it's about the squatters from what was there before 

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:04.259
 while before in the previous management I speak of the network in the cradle 

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:06.050
 previous administration of the municipality 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.709
 abusive here the delinquent precedent now has the capacity 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.349
 ocr and the desire to make a distinction in the rankings is for 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:18.159
 this we said an important date there are 20,000 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:20.409
 family waiting for accommodation 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:22.469
 none of them gloomy I hope 

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:23.310
 for which 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.379
 that clear that the occupation of starters 7 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:31.570
 and this I do not want to tell the citizens that it induces us to listen to they do not look at us 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.750
 employment in itself as well as being a crime 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.929
 eh counterproductive for those who do it 

00:03:37.929 --> 00:03:40.929
 to ask why the abusive occupant 

00:03:41.749 --> 00:03:46.139
 eheh cut off from the arpeggio rankings of the delight rankings 

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:49.289
 popular for 5 years then you're putting them right 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.040
 before you take it, think about it, that's exactly right now that we're putting it 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.500
 trying to put everything in order we will do it while I want to buy two 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.599
 first communication citizens 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:03.829
 and what diesel or only do you do 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:04.530
 self 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.730
 te citizens actively participate have a sense of responsibility 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.780
 because it is true that there are on TV the family of ducks spectrum but from 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:14.620
 decades 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:20.049
 the houses are blind to speed up the crickets we may have May 2012 data 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:20.919
 confirm 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:24.590
 and I hope thousands of homes -video italy street 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.319

00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:30.909
 pietro beetle sweets and home - these commitments just for e 

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:32.759
 to force me to Catania
