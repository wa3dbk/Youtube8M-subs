bubble<00:03:21.790> up<00:03:21.940> and<00:03:22.480> I'll<00:03:22.660> just<00:03:22.810> rub<00:03:23.049> it<00:03:23.079> together

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260

and I'll flip my head upside down and

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.940 
and I'll flip my head upside down and
get<00:03:25.630> in<00:03:25.720> my<00:03:25.750> roots<00:03:26.109> and<00:03:26.350> that's<00:03:26.500> just<00:03:26.650> add<00:03:26.920> a

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
get in my roots and that's just add a

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.560 
get in my roots and that's just add a
little<00:03:27.040> bit<00:03:27.310> of<00:03:27.370> volume<00:03:27.609> on<00:03:27.880> my<00:03:28.000> roots<00:03:28.209> because

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
little bit of volume on my roots because

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.960 
little bit of volume on my roots because
my<00:03:28.720> hair<00:03:28.959> is<00:03:28.989> pretty<00:03:29.650> flat<00:03:30.010> because<00:03:30.340> it's<00:03:30.640> long

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
my hair is pretty flat because it's long

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.440 
my hair is pretty flat because it's long
and<00:03:31.930> I<00:03:32.859> don't<00:03:33.370> like<00:03:33.489> to<00:03:33.549> use<00:03:33.850> it<00:03:34.090> so<00:03:34.120> that's

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
and I don't like to use it so that's

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.479 
and I don't like to use it so that's
what<00:03:34.600> I<00:03:34.630> do<00:03:34.720> for<00:03:35.019> volume<00:03:35.440> it's<00:03:36.069> still<00:03:36.310> not<00:03:36.430> very

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
what I do for volume it's still not very

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.360 
what I do for volume it's still not very
voluminous<00:03:36.940> but<00:03:37.480> it's<00:03:37.660> better<00:03:37.870> than<00:03:38.250> for<00:03:39.250> that

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
voluminous but it's better than for that

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.699 
voluminous but it's better than for that
hair<00:03:39.720> so<00:03:40.720> I<00:03:40.780> really<00:03:40.989> like<00:03:41.140> that<00:03:41.170> this<00:03:41.560> is

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
picking them up and I think altogether

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.050 
picking them up and I think altogether
would<00:04:54.920> probably<00:04:55.280> come<00:04:55.400> at<00:04:55.520> like<00:04:55.670> twelve

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 
would probably come at like twelve

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.760 
would probably come at like twelve
dollars<00:04:56.420> so<00:04:57.020> there's<00:04:57.200> not<00:04:57.350> really<00:04:57.530> much<00:04:57.710> to

dollars so there's not really much to

dollars so there's not really much to
lose<00:04:58.160> anyway<00:04:59.000> I<00:04:59.030> hope<00:04:59.360> you<00:04:59.540> enjoyed<00:04:59.840> this
