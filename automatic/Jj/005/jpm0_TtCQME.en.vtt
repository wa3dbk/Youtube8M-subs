left<00:01:01.609> side<00:01:01.820> course<00:01:02.149> my<00:01:02.960> second-to-last<00:01:03.500> run

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:04.479 
left side course my second-to-last run

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:06.730 
left side course my second-to-last run
we<00:01:05.479> made<00:01:05.659> a<00:01:05.690> little<00:01:05.840> adjustment<00:01:06.229> to<00:01:06.409> the<00:01:06.500> car

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
we made a little adjustment to the car

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.890 
we made a little adjustment to the car
with<00:01:07.520> the<00:01:07.610> rear<00:01:07.790> toe<00:01:08.030> I<00:01:08.330> thought<00:01:08.570> the<00:01:08.690> car

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
with the rear toe I thought the car

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.320 
with the rear toe I thought the car
really<00:01:09.860> was<00:01:10.130> responding<00:01:10.670> well<00:01:10.790> the<00:01:10.940> first<00:01:11.150> two

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
really was responding well the first two

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.560 
really was responding well the first two
runs<00:01:11.570> and<00:01:11.990> my<00:01:12.229> third<00:01:12.440> run<00:01:12.770> I<00:01:13.299> thought<00:01:14.299> which<00:01:14.450> is

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
runs and my third run I thought which is

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.210 
runs and my third run I thought which is
my<00:01:14.690> second<00:01:15.020> run<00:01:15.110> on<00:01:15.229> the<00:01:15.320> left<00:01:15.470> side<00:01:15.619> I<00:01:15.680> really

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
my second run on the left side I really

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.980 
my second run on the left side I really
just<00:01:16.540> started<00:01:17.540> to<00:01:17.600> get<00:01:17.690> a<00:01:17.720> little<00:01:17.780> more

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
just started to get a little more

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.359 
just started to get a little more
aggressive<00:01:18.140> of<00:01:18.409> the<00:01:18.440> car<00:01:18.680> a<00:01:18.710> car<00:01:19.100> kept

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
aggressive of the car a car kept

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:21.880 
aggressive of the car a car kept
responding<00:01:19.610> well<00:01:20.090> I<00:01:20.299> think<00:01:20.750> at<00:01:21.470> the<00:01:21.560> top<00:01:21.770> of

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
responding well I think at the top of

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.530 
responding well I think at the top of
the<00:01:21.979> course<00:01:22.190> when<00:01:22.970> you<00:01:23.060> were<00:01:23.180> going<00:01:23.390> through

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
the course when you were going through

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.469 
the course when you were going through
the<00:01:23.659> slalom<00:01:24.490> you<00:01:25.490> made<00:01:25.670> the<00:01:25.820> turn<00:01:26.000> to<00:01:26.149> go<00:01:26.270> down

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
the slalom you made the turn to go down

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:28.389 
the slalom you made the turn to go down
the<00:01:26.659> hill<00:01:26.810> right<00:01:27.560> before<00:01:27.799> you<00:01:27.890> make<00:01:27.920> the<00:01:28.159> shot

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:28.399 
the hill right before you make the shot

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:31.510 
the hill right before you make the shot
the<00:01:28.670> run<00:01:29.090> grip<00:01:29.360> going<00:01:29.630> across<00:01:29.780> a<00:01:29.869> lot<00:01:30.369> you<00:01:31.369> can

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
the run grip going across a lot you can

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.249 
the run grip going across a lot you can
really<00:01:31.820> mess<00:01:32.000> that<00:01:32.240> up<00:01:32.270> and<00:01:32.750> lose<00:01:32.960> a<00:01:32.990> lot<00:01:33.229> of

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
really mess that up and lose a lot of

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.649 
really mess that up and lose a lot of
time<00:01:33.500> for<00:01:33.830> the<00:01:33.979> speed<00:01:34.880> shot<00:01:35.210> going<00:01:35.479> across

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
time for the speed shot going across

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:37.990 
time for the speed shot going across
across<00:01:36.170> the<00:01:36.470> lot<00:01:36.649> so<00:01:36.920> I<00:01:36.950> think<00:01:37.280> I<00:01:37.399> really

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
across the lot so I think I really

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.910 
across the lot so I think I really
focused<00:01:38.420> on<00:01:38.600> that<00:01:38.780> and<00:01:39.020> how<00:01:39.170> late<00:01:39.409> to<00:01:39.710> break

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
focused on that and how late to break

00:01:39.920 --> 00:02:00.580 
focused on that and how late to break
into<00:01:40.130> the<00:01:40.280> finish<00:01:40.550> turns<00:01:59.020> on<00:02:00.020> the<00:02:00.110> right<00:02:00.319> side

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
into the finish turns on the right side

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.050 
into the finish turns on the right side
gotta<00:02:00.920> make<00:02:01.130> up<00:02:01.159> one<00:02:01.610> point<00:02:01.970> three<00:02:02.360> nine<00:02:02.659> zero

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
gotta make up one point three nine zero

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.330 
gotta make up one point three nine zero
for<00:02:05.060> Mike<00:02:05.270> a<00:02:05.560> 547<00:02:06.560> Shane<00:02:06.830> a<00:02:06.860> little<00:02:07.220> more

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
for Mike a 547 Shane a little more

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.170 
for Mike a 547 Shane a little more
leisurely<00:02:07.729> that<00:02:08.030> time<00:02:08.300> of<00:02:08.539> 669<00:02:09.670> so<00:02:10.670> Mike<00:02:10.910> gets

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
leisurely that time of 669 so Mike gets

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.600 
leisurely that time of 669 so Mike gets
a<00:02:11.300> tenth<00:02:11.629> of<00:02:11.959> what<00:02:12.530> he<00:02:12.860> needs<00:02:13.069> back<00:02:13.340> on<00:02:13.520> the

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
a tenth of what he needs back on the

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.940 
a tenth of what he needs back on the
reaction<00:02:14.150> times<00:02:14.390> but<00:02:14.810> he's<00:02:15.349> got<00:02:15.530> to<00:02:15.560> make<00:02:15.680> up

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
reaction times but he's got to make up

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.430 
reaction times but he's got to make up
about<00:02:16.239> another<00:02:17.239> three<00:02:17.629> tents<00:02:17.989> out<00:02:18.140> there<00:02:18.319> on

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
about another three tents out there on

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.500 
about another three tents out there on
the<00:02:18.590> course

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
the course

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.199 
the course
let's<00:02:20.510> see<00:02:20.720> what<00:02:20.900> he<00:02:20.989> can<00:02:21.170> do<00:02:21.379> even<00:02:22.090> if<00:02:23.090> that

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
let's see what he can do even if that

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.089 
let's see what he can do even if that
right<00:02:23.420> side<00:02:23.660> course<00:02:23.930> is<00:02:24.110> a<00:02:24.140> second<00:02:24.590> faster<00:02:24.800> you

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
right side course is a second faster you

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:26.949 
right side course is a second faster you
can<00:02:25.280> pick<00:02:25.400> up<00:02:25.489> another<00:02:25.550> three<00:02:26.000> we<00:02:26.750> must
