00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.599 

 right<00:00:15.509> so<00:00:15.750> we're<00:00:15.870> going<00:00:16.020> to<00:00:16.190> today<00:00:17.190> play

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
 right so we're going to today play

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.580 
 right so we're going to today play
with<00:00:17.820> efficiency<00:00:18.390> enchantments<00:00:19.140> instead<00:00:19.470> of

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
with efficiency enchantments instead of

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.599 
with efficiency enchantments instead of
the<00:00:19.800> fortune<00:00:20.310> ones<00:00:20.490> and<00:00:20.730> I've<00:00:20.880> got<00:00:21.150> my<00:00:21.359> as<00:00:21.750> I

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:22.609 
the fortune ones and I've got my as I

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:24.980 
the fortune ones and I've got my as I
guess<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.789> timing<00:00:24.090> in<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.390> bottom<00:00:24.600> corner

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
guess the timing in the bottom corner

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.439 
guess the timing in the bottom corner
just<00:00:25.619> to<00:00:25.710> show<00:00:26.279> how<00:00:26.490> badly<00:00:26.699> this<00:00:26.880> gets<00:00:27.060> cut<00:00:27.269> but

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
just to show how badly this gets cut but

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.230 
just to show how badly this gets cut but
also<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:27.990> use<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:28.470> sort<00:00:28.830> of<00:00:28.890> an<00:00:28.980> active<00:00:29.369> time

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
also to use and sort of an active time

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.820 
also to use and sort of an active time
recorder<00:00:30.689> thing<00:00:30.840> so<00:00:31.199> you<00:00:31.260> got<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.470> standard

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
recorder thing so you got the standard

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.090 
recorder thing so you got the standard
way<00:00:32.250> of<00:00:32.369> mining<00:00:32.759> stone<00:00:33.000> obviously<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:34.100> this

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
way of mining stone obviously and this

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.799 
way of mining stone obviously and this
isn't<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.489> best<00:00:35.670> sort<00:00:36.149> of<00:00:36.210> example<00:00:36.570> for<00:00:36.600> it

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
isn't the best sort of example for it

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.410 
isn't the best sort of example for it
I've<00:00:36.899> got<00:00:37.050> efficiency<00:00:37.500> two<00:00:37.739> and<00:00:38.010> ten<00:00:38.280> here<00:00:38.790> if

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
I've got efficiency two and ten here if

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.150 
I've got efficiency two and ten here if
I<00:00:39.570> just<00:00:39.690> go<00:00:40.200> there<00:00:40.230> you<00:00:40.440> can<00:00:40.559> easily<00:00:40.620> see<00:00:40.950> there

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
I just go there you can easily see there

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.090 
I just go there you can easily see there
is<00:00:41.250> some<00:00:41.460> kind<00:00:41.489> of<00:00:42.320> improvement<00:00:43.320> with<00:00:43.440> it<00:00:43.620> but

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
is some kind of improvement with it but

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.830 
is some kind of improvement with it but
the<00:00:44.280> efficiency<00:00:44.550> ten<00:00:44.850> pretty<00:00:45.360> much<00:00:45.480> just<00:00:45.660> one

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
the efficiency ten pretty much just one

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.970 
the efficiency ten pretty much just one
clicks<00:00:46.140> that<00:00:46.379> which<00:00:46.590> means<00:00:46.800> it's<00:00:46.980> not<00:00:47.280> too

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
clicks that which means it's not too

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.979 
clicks that which means it's not too
clear<00:00:49.980> or<00:00:50.340> inevitable<00:00:50.910> how<00:00:51.300> well<00:00:51.480> it<00:00:51.570> does<00:00:51.719> and

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
clear or inevitable how well it does and

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.360 
clear or inevitable how well it does and
if<00:00:52.079> you<00:00:52.170> consider<00:00:52.500> nether<00:00:52.829> axe<00:00:53.039> just<00:00:53.160> about

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
if you consider nether axe just about

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.430 
if you consider nether axe just about
the<00:00:53.489> first<00:00:53.670> thing<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:53.940> mine<00:00:54.199> efficiency<00:00:55.199> to

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
the first thing to mine efficiency to

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.270 
the first thing to mine efficiency to
does<00:00:55.710> that<00:00:55.890> anyway

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
does that anyway

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.540 
does that anyway
so<00:00:56.940> I'm<00:00:57.000> going<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.149> go<00:00:57.270> over<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.510> obsidian<00:00:57.870> and

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
so I'm going to go over to obsidian and

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.130 
so I'm going to go over to obsidian and
I<00:00:59.550> believe<00:00:59.820> this<00:00:59.969> takes<00:01:00.239> 10<00:01:00.449> seconds<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.960> mind

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
I believe this takes 10 seconds to mind

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.390 
I believe this takes 10 seconds to mind
styles<00:01:01.649> but<00:01:01.770> I'll<00:01:01.920> do<00:01:02.039> it<00:01:02.160> on<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.399> minute<00:01:04.400> okay

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
styles but I'll do it on the minute okay

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.380 
styles but I'll do it on the minute okay
so<00:01:05.460> we're<00:01:05.610> going<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.760> start<00:01:05.939> mining<00:01:06.240> there

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
so we're going to start mining there

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.510 
so we're going to start mining there
here<00:01:06.570> this<00:01:07.320> is<00:01:07.470> with<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.680> normal<00:01:07.979> pickaxe<00:01:08.369> so

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
here this is with the normal pickaxe so

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.710 
here this is with the normal pickaxe so
we're<00:01:08.640> expecting<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.090> take<00:01:09.330> about<00:01:09.510> ten

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
we're expecting to take about ten

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.200 
we're expecting to take about ten
seconds<00:01:10.280> we<00:01:11.280> can<00:01:11.430> really<00:01:11.580> see<00:01:11.790> how<00:01:11.909> much<00:01:12.030> of<00:01:12.090> a

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
seconds we can really see how much of a

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.340 
seconds we can really see how much of a
difference<00:01:12.540> it<00:01:12.659> will<00:01:12.720> make<00:01:12.780> between<00:01:13.260> the

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
difference it will make between the

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.280 
difference it will make between the
pickaxes<00:01:14.180> okay<00:01:15.180> so<00:01:15.240> we<00:01:15.330> did<00:01:15.479> take<00:01:15.630> 10<00:01:15.869> seconds

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
pickaxes okay so we did take 10 seconds

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.590 
pickaxes okay so we did take 10 seconds
bit<00:01:16.470> under<00:01:16.740> maybe<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.689> if<00:01:18.689> I<00:01:18.810> go<00:01:18.960> on<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.470> five

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
bit under maybe and if I go on the five

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:27.260 
bit under maybe and if I go on the five
this<00:01:21.600> with<00:01:21.869> efficiency<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:24.259> so<00:01:25.259> I<00:01:26.150> was<00:01:27.150> about

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
this with efficiency to so I was about

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.480 
this with efficiency to so I was about
six<00:01:27.630> seconds<00:01:28.020> so<00:01:28.409> I'm<00:01:28.560> expecting<00:01:28.829> efficiency

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
six seconds so I'm expecting efficiency

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.390 
six seconds so I'm expecting efficiency
10<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:30.030> be<00:01:30.150> about<00:01:30.390> maybe<00:01:30.689> three<00:01:31.079> so<00:01:32.070> if<00:01:32.130> we<00:01:32.280> do

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
10 to be about maybe three so if we do

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.090 
10 to be about maybe three so if we do
this<00:01:32.520> on<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.750> half

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:43.539 

okay<00:01:38.350> so<00:01:39.350> that<00:01:39.590> gets<00:01:39.830> like<00:01:41.920> pretty<00:01:42.920> much<00:01:42.950> sort

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
okay so that gets like pretty much sort

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:46.330 
okay so that gets like pretty much sort
of<00:01:43.670> two<00:01:44.330> seconds<00:01:44.780> ish<00:01:44.950> but<00:01:45.950> then<00:01:46.040> if<00:01:46.130> I<00:01:46.190> go<00:01:46.310> to

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
of two seconds ish but then if I go to

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.710 
of two seconds ish but then if I go to
this<00:01:46.520> final<00:01:46.790> one<00:01:47.030> which<00:01:47.180> I<00:01:47.270> know<00:01:47.390> people<00:01:47.540> were

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
this final one which I know people were

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.600 
this final one which I know people were
asking<00:01:48.020> about<00:01:48.110> which<00:01:48.409> isn't<00:01:49.130> showing<00:01:49.369> up

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
asking about which isn't showing up

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.140 
asking about which isn't showing up
because<00:01:49.850> of<00:01:50.240> where<00:01:50.900> I've<00:01:51.020> got<00:01:51.170> that<00:01:51.350> but

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 
because of where I've got that but

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:57.639 
because of where I've got that but
efficiency<00:01:53.150> enchantment<00:01:53.600> level<00:01:53.680> 999<00:01:56.649> I'm

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649 
efficiency enchantment level 999 I'm

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:59.590 
efficiency enchantment level 999 I'm
thinking<00:01:58.369> I<00:01:58.550> might<00:01:58.820> die<00:01:59.030> from<00:01:59.060> full<00:01:59.420> damage

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
thinking I might die from full damage

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.540 
thinking I might die from full damage
here

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.010 

okay<00:02:04.550> now<00:02:04.729> I'm<00:02:04.850> on<00:02:04.970> peaceful<00:02:05.360> so<00:02:05.479> I<00:02:05.509> didn't<00:02:05.750> but

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
okay now I'm on peaceful so I didn't but

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.490 
okay now I'm on peaceful so I didn't but
that<00:02:06.229> was<00:02:06.920> what<00:02:07.640> 22<00:02:08.119> obsidian<00:02:08.840> mines<00:02:09.080> in<00:02:09.320> like

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
that was what 22 obsidian mines in like

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.620 
that was what 22 obsidian mines in like
two<00:02:09.739> seconds<00:02:10.160> or<00:02:10.369> something<00:02:10.459> like<00:02:10.759> that<00:02:10.970> so

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
two seconds or something like that so

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.850 
two seconds or something like that so
yeah<00:02:15.100> it<00:02:16.100> just<00:02:16.209> shows<00:02:17.260> they<00:02:18.260> also<00:02:18.440> sort<00:02:18.800> of

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
yeah it just shows they also sort of

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
yeah it just shows they also sort of
adds<00:02:19.070> further<00:02:19.400> proof<00:02:19.850> oh<00:02:20.060> my<00:02:20.540> god<00:02:24.550> I'm<00:02:25.550> not<00:02:25.790> I'm

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
adds further proof oh my god I'm not I'm

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.130 
adds further proof oh my god I'm not I'm

this<00:02:34.430> is<00:02:34.640> a<00:02:34.910> hundred<00:02:35.420> up<00:02:35.569> 100<00:02:36.319> obsidian<00:02:36.709> should

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
this is a hundred up 100 obsidian should

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.130 
this is a hundred up 100 obsidian should
take<00:02:37.430> ten<00:02:37.850> what<00:02:40.120> thousand<00:02:41.120> seconds<00:02:41.450> good

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
take ten what thousand seconds good

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:51.069 
take ten what thousand seconds good
job<00:02:42.200> with<00:02:42.530> zeros<00:02:42.829> Tim<00:02:43.040> and<00:02:49.570> that's<00:02:50.570> how<00:02:50.840> quick

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:51.079 
job with zeros Tim and that's how quick

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:53.550 
job with zeros Tim and that's how quick
is<00:02:51.230> and<00:02:51.530> as<00:02:51.950> another<00:02:52.190> comparison<00:02:52.850> this<00:02:53.000> is<00:02:53.060> on

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
is and as another comparison this is on

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.699 
is and as another comparison this is on
creative<00:02:54.560> so<00:02:55.010> I<00:02:55.040> can<00:02:55.430> you<00:02:56.060> know<00:02:56.180> one<00:02:56.660> hit<00:02:56.930> one

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
creative so I can you know one hit one

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.500 
creative so I can you know one hit one
click<00:02:58.070> destroy<00:02:58.519> anything<00:02:58.880> anyway<00:02:59.150> but<00:02:59.329> if<00:02:59.420> I

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
click destroy anything anyway but if I

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.600 
click destroy anything anyway but if I
hold<00:02:59.780> that<00:02:59.840> down<00:03:00.260> you<00:03:00.799> can<00:03:00.980> still<00:03:01.250> see<00:03:01.489> that

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
hold that down you can still see that

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.120 
hold that down you can still see that
I'm<00:03:01.730> falling<00:03:02.000> significantly<00:03:02.930> slower<00:03:03.320> than<00:03:04.100> I

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
I'm falling significantly slower than I

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
how good that efficiency enchantment

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.039 
how good that efficiency enchantment
level<00:03:09.220> 999<00:03:10.220> actually<00:03:10.760> is<00:03:10.910> and<00:03:11.209> that<00:03:11.840> also

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
level 999 actually is and that also

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:14.830 
level 999 actually is and that also
explains<00:03:12.380> why<00:03:13.070> I<00:03:13.100> got<00:03:13.459> so<00:03:13.910> many<00:03:14.180> diamonds<00:03:14.570> in

explains why I got so many diamonds in
so<00:03:15.049> many<00:03:15.170> lappers<00:03:15.470> on<00:03:15.799> the<00:03:16.310> 999<00:03:17.180> 14<00:03:17.810> pickaxe

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
so many lappers on the 999 14 pickaxe

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.700 
so many lappers on the 999 14 pickaxe
thanks<00:03:19.340> for<00:03:19.459> watching
