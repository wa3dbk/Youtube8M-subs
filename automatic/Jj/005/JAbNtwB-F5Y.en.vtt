more in the cervical or upper thoracic
area<00:00:31.140> up<00:00:31.560> here<00:00:32.000> so<00:00:33.000> you<00:00:33.060> said<00:00:33.210> you've<00:00:33.330> got

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
area up here so you said you've got

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.480 
area up here so you said you've got

and ninth dorsal third cervical if we

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.600 
and ninth dorsal third cervical if we
want<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.350> simplify<00:00:37.650> it<00:00:37.830> that's<00:00:38.220> more<00:00:38.340> often

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
want to simplify it that's more often

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.340 
want to simplify it that's more often
than<00:00:38.760> not<00:00:38.790> what<00:00:39.060> he<00:00:39.120> said<00:00:39.360> these<00:00:40.110> are<00:00:40.170> the

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
than not what he said these are the

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.140 
than not what he said these are the
great<00:00:40.650> centers<00:00:41.070> from<00:00:41.280> which<00:00:41.490> the<00:00:41.670> cerebral

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:42.150 
great centers from which the cerebral

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.150 
great centers from which the cerebral
spinal<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:42.660> sympathetic<00:00:43.020> coordinate<00:00:43.680> he

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
spinal and sympathetic coordinate he

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.530 
spinal and sympathetic coordinate he
also<00:00:44.340> called<00:00:44.670> these<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.850> coordinating

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:45.540 
also called these the coordinating

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.870 
also called these the coordinating
centers<00:00:45.930> so<00:00:46.920> these<00:00:47.040> are<00:00:47.250> really<00:00:47.370> important

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:47.880 
centers so these are really important

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.390 
centers so these are really important
and<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.600> significance<00:00:49.200> of<00:00:49.350> this<00:00:49.560> when<00:00:50.370> I

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:50.400 
and the significance of this when I

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.330 
and the significance of this when I
looked<00:00:51.180> looked<00:00:52.050> in<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.410> literature<00:00:52.770> I<00:00:52.800> found

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
said where we circled this there are

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.789

enlarged refused ganglia and these
sympathetic<00:01:26.609> chain<00:01:26.640> so<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:27.659> think<00:01:27.840> about

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
sympathetic chain so you think about

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.569 
sympathetic chain so you think about
these<00:01:28.109> little<00:01:28.380> balls<00:01:28.530> of<00:01:28.679> nerve<00:01:28.859> tissue<00:01:29.249> along

your pair of spinal massage they're not
all<00:01:32.639> equal<00:01:33.119> there's<00:01:33.810> certain<00:01:34.170> areas<00:01:34.469> where

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
all equal there's certain areas where

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.499 
all equal there's certain areas where
there's<00:01:35.280> balls<00:01:35.549> of<00:01:35.789> nerve<00:01:35.939> tissue<00:01:36.210> there

there's balls of nerve tissue there

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.050 
there's balls of nerve tissue there
there's<00:01:36.719> little<00:01:37.560> brains<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.219> those<00:01:38.850> are<00:01:38.999> the

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
coordinating centers and this is what

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.830 
coordinating centers and this is what
Casey<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:40.799> referring<00:01:41.249> to<00:01:41.460> it's<00:01:42.359> isn't<00:01:42.719> that

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
Casey is referring to it's isn't that

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.870 
Casey is referring to it's isn't that
interesting<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:44.069> he<00:01:44.189> actually<00:01:44.520> refers<00:01:44.850> to

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
interesting and he actually refers to

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:45.889 
interesting and he actually refers to
them<00:01:45.179> sometime<00:01:45.479> where<00:01:45.659> they're<00:01:45.780> they're

that hold that thought okay that is
what's<00:02:05.069> meant<00:02:05.279> by<00:02:05.369> keeping<00:02:05.789> a<00:02:05.880> coordination

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
what's meant by keeping a coordination

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.749 
what's meant by keeping a coordination

the neuro kilometer that you may have
heard<00:02:28.240> of<00:02:28.420> I<00:02:28.600> think<00:02:28.660> there<00:02:28.930> may<00:02:29.200> be<00:02:29.230> using<00:02:29.560> it

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
heard of I think there may be using it

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.110 
heard of I think there may be using it
up<00:02:29.740> there<00:02:29.950> he<00:02:30.220> actually<00:02:30.520> in<00:02:30.640> this<00:02:30.700> reading<00:02:31.030> he

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
up there he actually in this reading he

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.670 
up there he actually in this reading he
said<00:02:31.330> they<00:02:31.870> said<00:02:32.110> well<00:02:32.230> how<00:02:32.320> do<00:02:32.380> you<00:02:32.500> know<00:02:32.590> if

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
said they said well how do you know if

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.050 
said they said well how do you know if
they<00:02:32.770> coordinate<00:02:33.220> he<00:02:33.310> said<00:02:33.520> use<00:02:33.670> this<00:02:33.820> neuro

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
they coordinate he said use this neuro

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.820 
they coordinate he said use this neuro

another could you see how the lack of
coordination<00:03:08.230> there<00:03:08.830> if<00:03:09.010> these<00:03:09.220> centers

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
coordination there if these centers

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.130 
coordination there if these centers
aren't<00:03:09.700> operating<00:03:10.300> at<00:03:10.510> the<00:03:10.600> same<00:03:10.780> level<00:03:11.110> of

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
intensity if you think of it that way so

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.810 
intensity if you think of it that way so
you<00:03:13.690> find<00:03:14.140> the<00:03:14.230> Cayce<00:03:14.440> readings<00:03:14.710> he<00:03:15.460> says<00:03:15.670> when

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
you find the Cayce readings he says when

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.420 
you find the Cayce readings he says when
you<00:03:15.850> make<00:03:16.060> these<00:03:16.210> adjustments<00:03:17.310> make<00:03:18.310> the

the same level particularly if you have

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:24.810 
the same level particularly if you have
a<00:03:23.230> tendency<00:03:23.680> just<00:03:23.710> to<00:03:23.950> treat<00:03:24.130> the<00:03:24.280> same<00:03:24.430> center

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
a tendency just to treat the same center

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:25.980 
a tendency just to treat the same center
over<00:03:25.060> and<00:03:25.180> over<00:03:25.420> like<00:03:25.630> the<00:03:25.750> early

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:25.990 
over and over like the early

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:27.990 
over and over like the early
chiropractors<00:03:26.650> would<00:03:26.800> treat<00:03:27.070> the<00:03:27.250> cervical

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
chiropractors would treat the cervical

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.630 
chiropractors would treat the cervical
area<00:03:28.150> the<00:03:29.110> hole<00:03:29.290> in<00:03:29.440> one<00:03:29.650> as<00:03:29.860> Palmer<00:03:30.130> called<00:03:30.490> it

area the hole in one as Palmer called it

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.510 
area the hole in one as Palmer called it
he<00:03:31.540> said<00:03:31.810> well<00:03:32.440> you<00:03:32.560> may<00:03:32.710> make<00:03:32.890> the<00:03:32.920> correction

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:33.520 
he said well you may make the correction

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.550 
he said well you may make the correction
but<00:03:33.790> you're<00:03:34.060> stimulating<00:03:34.330> those<00:03:34.870> centers

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
but you're stimulating those centers

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.380 
but you're stimulating those centers
every<00:03:35.920> time<00:03:36.100> you<00:03:36.250> just<00:03:36.400> keep<00:03:36.700> doing<00:03:36.940> that<00:03:36.970> and

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
every time you just keep doing that and

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.360 
every time you just keep doing that and
that<00:03:38.050> part<00:03:38.560> of<00:03:38.680> the<00:03:38.740> body<00:03:38.980> is<00:03:39.130> going<00:03:39.160> to<00:03:39.280> be

they make the correction and then they
coordinate<00:03:59.530> and<00:03:59.950> not<00:04:00.340> just<00:04:00.580> assume<00:04:00.880> that<00:04:01.030> the

body is going to coordinate itself but

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.230 
body is going to coordinate itself but
go<00:04:03.070> ahead<00:04:03.220> and<00:04:03.340> make<00:04:03.430> the<00:04:03.580> coordination<00:04:04.120> as

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:04.240 
go ahead and make the coordination as

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
go ahead and make the coordination as

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
pulsation and there's how do they do

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.220 
pulsation and there's how do they do
that<00:04:11.080> either<00:04:11.830> by<00:04:12.120> gentle<00:04:13.120> inhibition<00:04:13.720> you<00:04:14.020> see

or a gentle stimulation with this pair
of<00:04:16.630> spinal<00:04:16.959> massage<00:04:17.080> that's<00:04:17.620> how<00:04:17.739> you

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
of spinal massage that's how you

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.620 
of spinal massage that's how you
coordinate<00:04:18.400> so<00:04:18.549> they're<00:04:18.760> all<00:04:18.880> operating<00:04:19.570> at

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
coordinate so they're all operating at

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:19.819 
coordinate so they're all operating at
the

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829
