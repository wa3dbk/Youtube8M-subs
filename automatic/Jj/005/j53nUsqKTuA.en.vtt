with<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.440> uranium<00:00:34.440> oxide<00:00:34.920> give<00:00:35.250> them<00:00:35.340> the

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
with the uranium oxide give them the

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.410 
with the uranium oxide give them the
yellow<00:00:36.020> color<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.550> it<00:00:38.550> you<00:00:39.059> know<00:00:39.149> it's<00:00:39.329> a

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
pretty bottle in itself as it is but the

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.369 
pretty bottle in itself as it is but the
thing<00:00:42.930> about<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.410> uranium<00:00:44.309> oxide<00:00:44.789> is<00:00:45.379> that

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
thing about the uranium oxide is that

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:53.410 
thing about the uranium oxide is that
under<00:00:46.680> UV<00:00:46.829> light<00:00:47.059> they<00:00:48.059> tend<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.510> glow<00:00:48.809> green

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:01:00.430 

just<00:00:54.420> like<00:00:54.570> that<00:00:57.079> it<00:00:58.670> changes<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.879> character

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
just like that it changes the character

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.789 
just like that it changes the character
drastically<00:01:01.440> of<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.620> bottle<00:01:03.320> it<00:01:04.320> really

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
drastically of the bottle it really

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.039 
drastically of the bottle it really
gives<00:01:04.979> it<00:01:05.129> a<00:01:05.220> good<00:01:05.689> glowing<00:01:06.689> green<00:01:06.960> color<00:01:09.049> like

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049
