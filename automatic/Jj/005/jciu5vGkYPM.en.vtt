and that will fit in just about any
device<00:01:51.229> but<00:01:52.229> as<00:01:52.439> far<00:01:53.040> as<00:01:53.100> these<00:01:53.460> go<00:01:53.759> i'm<00:01:54.210> not

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
device but as far as these go i'm not

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.170 
device but as far as these go i'm not
sure<00:01:54.710> that<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:56.100> sound<00:01:56.369> quality<00:01:56.610> is<00:01:56.939> there

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
sure that the sound quality is there

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.450 
sure that the sound quality is there
because<00:01:57.899> although<00:01:58.229> there's<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.680> definite<00:01:59.159> bump

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
because although there's a definite bump

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.050 
because although there's a definite bump
for<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.390> amount<00:02:00.750> that<00:02:00.899> it<00:02:01.170> costs<00:02:01.860> unless<00:02:02.130> you

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
for the amount that it costs unless you

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.060 
for the amount that it costs unless you
get<00:02:03.299> them<00:02:03.479> for<00:02:03.780> about<00:02:03.869> half<00:02:04.320> price<00:02:04.680> i<00:02:04.890> don't

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
get them for about half price i don't

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.340 
get them for about half price i don't
think<00:02:05.280> it's<00:02:05.430> worth<00:02:05.670> it<00:02:05.969> because<00:02:06.170> you're<00:02:07.170> not

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
think it's worth it because you're not

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.160 
think it's worth it because you're not
moving<00:02:07.950> up<00:02:08.099> high<00:02:08.429> enough<00:02:08.660> for<00:02:09.660> it<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:09.840> be<00:02:10.140> very

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
moving up high enough for it to be very

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.800 
moving up high enough for it to be very
good<00:02:10.739> but<00:02:11.039> there<00:02:12.030> are<00:02:12.150> those<00:02:12.300> of<00:02:12.510> you<00:02:12.629> who

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
good but there are those of you who

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.540 
good but there are those of you who
probably<00:02:13.110> say

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
probably say

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.750

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.910 
well I just wanted a little bit clearer
music<00:02:16.760> and<00:02:17.000> so<00:02:17.360> that's<00:02:17.630> all<00:02:17.870> you<00:02:18.020> you<00:02:18.530> wanted

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
music and so that's all you you wanted

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.890 
music and so that's all you you wanted
and<00:02:19.040> you<00:02:19.100> didn't<00:02:19.370> want<00:02:19.520> to<00:02:19.670> go<00:02:19.730> for<00:02:20.030> the<00:02:20.060> very

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
and you didn't want to go for the very

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.830 
and you didn't want to go for the very
expensive<00:02:21.560> beats<00:02:21.800> and<00:02:22.130> I<00:02:22.280> respect<00:02:22.850> that<00:02:22.970> but

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
expensive beats and I respect that but

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.350 
expensive beats and I respect that but
overall<00:02:24.380> I<00:02:24.770> would<00:02:24.890> say<00:02:25.180> that<00:02:26.180> these

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
overall I would say that these

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.780 
overall I would say that these
headphones<00:02:26.930> are<00:02:27.530> just<00:02:28.130> decent<00:02:29.380> just<00:02:30.380> decent

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
headphones are just decent just decent

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.730 
headphones are just decent just decent
but<00:02:31.790> there<00:02:32.060> but<00:02:32.930> I<00:02:32.960> would<00:02:33.230> still<00:02:33.500> recommend

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
but there but I would still recommend

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.180 
but there but I would still recommend
them<00:02:34.250> to<00:02:34.280> someone<00:02:34.700> who<00:02:35.320> was<00:02:36.320> tired<00:02:36.650> of<00:02:36.950> like

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
them to someone who was tired of like

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.350 
them to someone who was tired of like
poor<00:02:37.580> quality<00:02:38.090> inn<00:02:38.390> in<00:02:39.230> their<00:02:40.010> music<00:02:40.400> from<00:02:40.880> the

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
poor quality inn in their music from the

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.160 
poor quality inn in their music from the
basic<00:02:41.780> headphones<00:02:42.520> and<00:02:43.870> overall<00:02:44.870> I<00:02:44.900> think

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
basic headphones and overall I think

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.950 
basic headphones and overall I think
they're<00:02:45.710> they've<00:02:46.370> got<00:02:46.640> a<00:02:46.910> pretty<00:02:47.330> good<00:02:47.600> build

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:47.960 
they're they've got a pretty good build

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.530 
they're they've got a pretty good build
because<00:02:48.320> of<00:02:48.650> the<00:02:48.740> little<00:02:48.950> details<00:02:49.430> I<00:02:49.760> don't

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
because of the little details I don't

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.170 
because of the little details I don't
know<00:02:50.690> but<00:02:50.930> this<00:02:51.410> headphone<00:02:52.400> jack<00:02:52.730> seems<00:02:53.030> a

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
know but this headphone jack seems a

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.350 
know but this headphone jack seems a
little<00:02:53.330> flimsy<00:02:54.190> but<00:02:55.190> overall<00:02:55.670> I<00:02:55.790> think<00:02:56.030> it's

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
little flimsy but overall I think it's

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.180 
little flimsy but overall I think it's
just<00:02:56.450> a<00:02:58.120> starter<00:02:59.120> headphones<00:02:59.660> until<00:03:00.350> you<00:03:01.010> move

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
just a starter headphones until you move

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:07.930 
just a starter headphones until you move
on<00:03:01.400> to<00:03:01.730> a<00:03:01.940> better<00:03:02.060> one<00:03:02.720> like<00:03:03.320> I<00:03:03.500> did<00:03:04.150> but<00:03:06.610> if<00:03:07.610> you

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
on to a better one like I did but if you

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.690 
on to a better one like I did but if you
do<00:03:08.210> like<00:03:08.480> these<00:03:08.720> headphones<00:03:09.400> then<00:03:10.400> there<00:03:10.670> is

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.510

nothing<00:03:11.300> wrong<00:03:11.330> with<00:03:11.750> that<00:03:11.900> because<00:03:12.520> there's

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
nothing wrong with that because there's

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.400
