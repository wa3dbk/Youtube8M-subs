we are at the ETU event in London and

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:27.990 
we are at the ETU event in London and
I'm<00:00:25.509> with<00:00:25.750> Jim<00:00:26.050> signal<00:00:26.500> the<00:00:26.710> crater<00:00:27.220> of<00:00:27.340> a<00:00:27.849> game

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:28.000 
I'm with Jim signal the crater of a game

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.359 
I'm with Jim signal the crater of a game
called<00:00:28.329> sure<00:00:28.599> you<00:00:28.900> are<00:00:29.050> being<00:00:29.199> hunted<00:00:29.470> Jim

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:31.449 
could you tell us a little bit about the

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:33.869 
could you tell us a little bit about the
game<00:00:31.570> what<00:00:32.349> you're<00:00:32.470> doing<00:00:32.649> it<00:00:32.769> so<00:00:33.760> you're

00:00:33.869 --> 00:00:33.879 
game what you're doing it so you're

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:36.090 
game what you're doing it so you're
being<00:00:34.059> hunted<00:00:34.180> is<00:00:34.570> open-world<00:00:35.530> stealth<00:00:35.980> and

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
being hunted is open-world stealth and

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.660 
being hunted is open-world stealth and
survival

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670 
survival

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.280 
survival
it's<00:00:37.000> procedurally<00:00:37.420> generated<00:00:37.780> which<00:00:38.050> means

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.290 
it's procedurally generated which means

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.710 
it's procedurally generated which means
all<00:00:39.159> the<00:00:39.400> maps<00:00:39.579> that<00:00:39.909> all<00:00:40.030> the<00:00:40.150> environments

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:40.720 
all the maps that all the environments

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.899 
all the maps that all the environments
are<00:00:40.870> bespoke<00:00:41.290> per<00:00:41.500> player<00:00:41.829> so<00:00:42.190> when<00:00:42.550> you<00:00:42.640> start

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:42.909 
are bespoke per player so when you start

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:45.060 
are bespoke per player so when you start
generate<00:00:43.570> a<00:00:43.600> world<00:00:43.900> after<00:00:44.589> that<00:00:44.710> you<00:00:44.829> go<00:00:44.980> on

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
generate a world after that you go on

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.439 
generate a world after that you go on
and<00:00:45.220> explore<00:00:45.579> it<00:00:45.760> play<00:00:45.970> through<00:00:46.000> that<00:00:46.210> world

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:46.449 
and explore it play through that world

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:47.790 
and explore it play through that world
try<00:00:46.750> and<00:00:46.839> survive<00:00:47.050> and<00:00:47.230> eventually<00:00:47.320> try<00:00:47.680> and

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
try and survive and eventually try and

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.350 
try and survive and eventually try and
get<00:00:48.129> off<00:00:48.250> the<00:00:48.370> islands<00:00:48.790> on<00:00:48.909> which<00:00:48.970> are<00:00:49.239> being

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:49.360 
get off the islands on which are being

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.630 
get off the islands on which are being
hunted<00:00:49.690> by<00:00:49.930> a<00:00:50.500> bunch<00:00:50.980> of<00:00:51.040> robots

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
hunted by a bunch of robots

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.420 
hunted by a bunch of robots
despoiling<00:00:52.390> of<00:00:52.659> the<00:00:52.750> game<00:00:52.899> is<00:00:53.140> the<00:00:53.680> robots<00:00:54.339> are

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
despoiling of the game is the robots are

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.340 
despoiling of the game is the robots are
almost<00:00:54.640> like<00:00:54.820> English<00:00:55.149> Victorian<00:00:55.840> gentlemen

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
almost like English Victorian gentlemen

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129 
yeah here behind it was to make it

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:03.810 
yeah here behind it was to make it
British<00:01:00.460> so<00:01:00.730> it's<00:01:01.600> a<00:01:01.690> British<00:01:01.840> landscape<00:01:02.820> it's

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
British so it's a British landscape it's

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.850 
British so it's a British landscape it's
all<00:01:03.969> British<00:01:04.269> sort<00:01:04.479> of<00:01:04.539> architecture<00:01:05.470> British

on the British class system in there in

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.120 
on the British class system in there in
the<00:01:10.179> sort<00:01:10.360> of<00:01:10.390> tiers<00:01:10.600> of<00:01:10.810> robots<00:01:11.200> if<00:01:11.979> you

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
the sort of tiers of robots if you

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.800 
the sort of tiers of robots if you
appreciate<00:01:12.610> you<00:01:12.640> be<00:01:12.789> generating<00:01:13.300> landscapes

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
appreciate you be generating landscapes

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.510 
appreciate you be generating landscapes
how<00:01:14.050> do<00:01:14.110> you<00:01:14.259> how<00:01:14.470> do<00:01:14.530> you<00:01:14.679> bring<00:01:14.979> Britishness

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
how do you how do you bring Britishness

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.749 
how do you how do you bring Britishness
into<00:01:16.119> a<00:01:16.149> procedural<00:01:17.020> and<00:01:17.280> we<00:01:18.280> sat<00:01:18.460> down<00:01:18.490> and

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759 
into a procedural and we sat down and

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:19.859 
into a procedural and we sat down and
talked<00:01:18.940> about<00:01:19.060> the<00:01:19.270> kind<00:01:19.450> of<00:01:19.570> things<00:01:19.750> that

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
talked about the kind of things that

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:22.080 
talked about the kind of things that
actually<00:01:19.990> made<00:01:20.289> landscapes<00:01:21.039> work<00:01:21.399> and<00:01:21.759> and

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
actually made landscapes work and and

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.240 
actually made landscapes work and and
and<00:01:22.270> looked<00:01:22.960> we<00:01:23.140> studied<00:01:23.409> them<00:01:23.560> visually<00:01:23.920> so

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
and looked we studied them visually so

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.980 
and looked we studied them visually so
and<00:01:24.520> that<00:01:24.940> there<00:01:25.060> are<00:01:25.090> lots<00:01:25.360> of<00:01:25.450> little<00:01:25.539> points

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
and that there are lots of little points

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.380 
and that there are lots of little points
in<00:01:26.170> British<00:01:27.039> landscapes<00:01:27.520> that<00:01:27.729> you<00:01:28.239> might

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
in British landscapes that you might

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.089 
in British landscapes that you might
miss<00:01:28.660> if<00:01:28.929> you<00:01:28.989> weren't<00:01:29.259> studying<00:01:29.530> them<00:01:29.890> from

00:01:30.089 --> 00:01:30.099 
miss if you weren't studying them from

00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:32.490 
miss if you weren't studying them from
sort<00:01:30.310> of<00:01:30.630> sort<00:01:31.630> of<00:01:31.660> a<00:01:31.810> physical<00:01:31.959> top<00:01:32.380> of

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
sort of sort of a physical top of

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.469 
sort of sort of a physical top of
African<00:01:32.890> nature<00:01:33.520> like<00:01:33.670> it<00:01:33.849> for<00:01:33.970> example<00:01:34.030> our

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
African nature like it for example our

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:37.620 
African nature like it for example our
friends<00:01:34.899> maps<00:01:35.140> which<00:01:35.709> are<00:01:36.119> very<00:01:37.119> water<00:01:37.330> logs

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
friends maps which are very water logs

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:38.850 
friends maps which are very water logs
and<00:01:37.869> have<00:01:38.020> channels<00:01:38.349> running<00:01:38.440> through<00:01:38.709> them

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
and have channels running through them

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.800 
and have channels running through them
and<00:01:38.920> stuff<00:01:39.130> the<00:01:39.610> the<00:01:39.640> one<00:01:40.239> of<00:01:40.330> the<00:01:40.390> primary

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
and stuff the the one of the primary

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.419 
and stuff the the one of the primary
features<00:01:41.140> in<00:01:41.229> them<00:01:41.319> are<00:01:41.440> rows<00:01:41.649> of<00:01:41.679> posts<00:01:42.310> so

00:01:42.419 --> 00:01:42.429 
features in them are rows of posts so

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:44.219 
features in them are rows of posts so
you<00:01:42.489> have<00:01:42.880> collapse<00:01:43.239> fences<00:01:43.750> little

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
you have collapse fences little

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:45.779 
you have collapse fences little
characteristic<00:01:44.890> things<00:01:45.069> like<00:01:45.280> that<00:01:45.459> or<00:01:45.640> for

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:45.789 
characteristic things like that or for

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:48.089 
characteristic things like that or for
example<00:01:46.209> how<00:01:46.300> brambles<00:01:47.110> structure<00:01:47.920> most

00:01:48.089 --> 00:01:48.099 
example how brambles structure most

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:49.469 
example how brambles structure most
hedgerows<00:01:48.670> in<00:01:49.030> the<00:01:49.119> British<00:01:49.330> countryside

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
hedgerows in the British countryside

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:52.380 
hedgerows in the British countryside
little<00:01:50.349> things<00:01:50.530> like<00:01:50.709> that<00:01:50.950> when<00:01:51.520> we<00:01:52.030> detail

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
little things like that when we detail

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:53.639 
little things like that when we detail
them<00:01:52.599> and<00:01:52.720> put<00:01:52.840> them<00:01:52.929> into<00:01:53.050> the<00:01:53.229> system<00:01:53.410> and

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:53.649 
them and put them into the system and

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:56.100 
them and put them into the system and
allow<00:01:53.709> the<00:01:53.950> game<00:01:54.190> to<00:01:54.610> generate<00:01:54.970> them<00:01:55.179> if<00:01:55.929> that

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
allow the game to generate them if that

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.389 
allow the game to generate them if that
becomes<00:01:56.349> incredibly<00:01:56.800> authentic<00:01:56.890> and<00:01:57.340> it

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:57.399 
becomes incredibly authentic and it

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:58.830 
becomes incredibly authentic and it
becomes<00:01:57.610> recognized<00:01:58.149> when<00:01:58.330> we<00:01:58.390> British<00:01:58.569> in

the way that we've allowed the game to

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:01.859 
the way that we've allowed the game to
put<00:02:00.429> that<00:02:00.580> stuff<00:02:00.700> together<00:02:00.849> now<00:02:01.270> most<00:02:01.629> games

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
put that stuff together now most games

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:03.930 
put that stuff together now most games
would<00:02:02.080> will<00:02:02.590> employ<00:02:03.039> a<00:02:03.069> level<00:02:03.369> designer<00:02:03.459> or

build their environments by hand so you

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.719

and all that kind of stuff we couldn't

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.000 
and all that kind of stuff we couldn't
afford<00:02:13.690> to<00:02:13.900> do<00:02:14.050> that<00:02:14.200> we<00:02:14.410> still<00:02:14.590> wanted<00:02:14.980> that

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
afford to do that we still wanted that

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.550 
afford to do that we still wanted that
kind<00:02:15.340> of<00:02:15.430> huge<00:02:15.760> open<00:02:16.120> world<00:02:16.150> feel<00:02:16.629> so<00:02:17.349> the<00:02:17.440> only

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
kind of huge open world feel so the only

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.630 
kind of huge open world feel so the only
way<00:02:17.680> for<00:02:17.800> us<00:02:17.830> to<00:02:17.980> do<00:02:18.069> that<00:02:18.190> was<00:02:18.310> to<00:02:18.340> write<00:02:18.610> a

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
way for us to do that was to write a

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.070 
way for us to do that was to write a
program<00:02:18.910> that<00:02:19.239> did<00:02:19.360> it<00:02:19.450> mathematically<00:02:20.050> that

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
program that did it mathematically that

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.720 
program that did it mathematically that
new<00:02:20.530> word<00:02:20.709> should<00:02:20.950> place<00:02:21.160> buildings<00:02:21.580> that

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
new word should place buildings that

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.490 
new word should place buildings that
knew<00:02:21.849> how<00:02:22.060> big<00:02:22.209> field<00:02:22.480> should<00:02:22.750> be<00:02:22.900> new<00:02:23.349> that

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
knew how big field should be new that

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:24.839 
knew how big field should be new that
field<00:02:23.709> should<00:02:23.860> have<00:02:24.010> hedgerows<00:02:24.400> along<00:02:24.700> them

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849 
field should have hedgerows along them

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:26.729 
field should have hedgerows along them
or<00:02:25.090> walls<00:02:25.629> along<00:02:25.870> them<00:02:26.050> knew<00:02:26.170> that<00:02:26.319> rut<00:02:26.500> Road

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
or walls along them knew that rut Road

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:28.680 
or walls along them knew that rut Road
should<00:02:27.010> run<00:02:27.190> through<00:02:27.400> them<00:02:27.670> knew<00:02:28.209> that<00:02:28.390> trees

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
should run through them knew that trees

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.360 
should run through them knew that trees
should<00:02:28.930> drop<00:02:29.110> a<00:02:29.170> certain<00:02:29.500> distance<00:02:29.769> apart<00:02:29.920> all

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
should drop a certain distance apart all

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.479 
should drop a certain distance apart all
that<00:02:30.489> kind<00:02:30.730> of

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
that kind of

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.240 
that kind of
and<00:02:32.120> when<00:02:32.569> that<00:02:32.689> runs<00:02:32.930> that<00:02:33.170> creates<00:02:33.500> the

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
and when that runs that creates the

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.250 
and when that runs that creates the
world<00:02:34.430> that<00:02:34.760> were<00:02:34.879> you<00:02:35.090> yeah<00:02:35.599> yeah<00:02:35.930> well<00:02:36.140> can

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
world that were you yeah yeah well can

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.209 
world that were you yeah yeah well can
we<00:02:36.349> have<00:02:36.469> a<00:02:36.500> quick<00:02:36.650> look<00:02:36.829> at<00:02:36.980> the<00:02:37.040> game<00:02:37.189> and

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:37.219 
we have a quick look at the game and

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:39.670 
we have a quick look at the game and
have<00:02:37.489> a<00:02:37.670> look<00:02:37.790> at<00:02:37.939> you<00:02:38.000> playing<00:02:38.180> it<00:02:38.420> yep<00:02:39.049> okay

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
have a look at you playing it yep okay

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.309 
have a look at you playing it yep okay
so<00:02:39.980> I've<00:02:40.340> just<00:02:40.400> generated<00:02:41.209> this<00:02:41.359> world<00:02:41.629> we

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
so I've just generated this world we

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.380 
so I've just generated this world we
start<00:02:42.560> off<00:02:42.650> at<00:02:42.829> a<00:02:42.859> standing<00:02:43.250> stone<00:02:43.549> circle<00:02:44.180> so

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
start off at a standing stone circle so

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.830 
start off at a standing stone circle so
fairly<00:02:45.260> fairly<00:02:45.620> common<00:02:46.040> feature<00:02:46.790> in<00:02:47.299> the

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
fairly fairly common feature in the

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.000 
fairly fairly common feature in the
British<00:02:48.049> landscape<00:02:48.379> we<00:02:48.470> found<00:02:48.680> it<00:02:48.769> find<00:02:48.950> a

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
British landscape we found it find a

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.520 
British landscape we found it find a
fallen<00:02:49.400> robot<00:02:49.810> just<00:02:50.810> some<00:02:50.959> tips<00:02:51.200> and<00:02:51.349> things

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
fallen robot just some tips and things

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.170 
fallen robot just some tips and things
they<00:02:51.650> have<00:02:51.739> what<00:02:51.890> to<00:02:51.980> do<00:02:52.129> and<00:02:52.790> we<00:02:52.879> can<00:02:53.030> loop<00:02:53.150> the

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
they have what to do and we can loop the

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.690 
they have what to do and we can loop the
stuff<00:02:53.480> from<00:02:53.689> it<00:02:53.780> from<00:02:53.900> his<00:02:54.049> body<00:02:54.340> but<00:02:55.340> the

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
stuff from it from his body but the

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.759 
stuff from it from his body but the
thing<00:02:55.879> that<00:02:55.909> we're<00:02:56.060> really<00:02:56.239> trying<00:02:56.420> to<00:02:56.569> do<00:02:56.769> is

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
thing that we're really trying to do is

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:00.129 
thing that we're really trying to do is
to<00:02:58.010> collect<00:02:58.220> back<00:02:58.549> pieces<00:02:59.030> of<00:02:59.239> a<00:02:59.329> machine<00:02:59.659> with

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:00.139 
to collect back pieces of a machine with

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:01.899 
to collect back pieces of a machine with
a<00:03:00.170> scattered<00:03:00.590> across<00:03:00.680> the<00:03:00.829> islands<00:03:01.280> now<00:03:01.459> the

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:01.909 
a scattered across the islands now the

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:03.099 
a scattered across the islands now the
pieces<00:03:02.180> of<00:03:02.269> the<00:03:02.329> Machine<00:03:02.389> are<00:03:02.689> going<00:03:02.840> to<00:03:02.900> allow

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:03.109 
pieces of the Machine are going to allow

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:05.619 
pieces of the Machine are going to allow
us<00:03:03.139> to<00:03:03.500> get<00:03:03.650> off<00:03:03.950> the<00:03:04.430> island<00:03:04.549> if<00:03:05.209> I<00:03:05.329> get<00:03:05.450> out<00:03:05.540> my

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:05.629 
us to get off the island if I get out my

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:07.479 
us to get off the island if I get out my
binoculars<00:03:05.840> here<00:03:06.379> I<00:03:06.620> can<00:03:06.859> see<00:03:07.069> that<00:03:07.250> off<00:03:07.370> in

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
binoculars here I can see that off in

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.640 
binoculars here I can see that off in
the<00:03:07.549> distance<00:03:07.700> as<00:03:08.540> a<00:03:08.599> postbox<00:03:09.079> but<00:03:09.349> behind<00:03:09.500> the

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
the distance as a postbox but behind the

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:10.179 
the distance as a postbox but behind the
postbox

00:03:10.179 --> 00:03:10.189 
postbox

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:12.250 
postbox
there<00:03:10.819> are<00:03:11.000> some<00:03:11.150> robots<00:03:11.480> and<00:03:11.750> that<00:03:11.930> trail<00:03:12.230> of

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
there are some robots and that trail of

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.530 
there are some robots and that trail of
smoke<00:03:12.470> that<00:03:13.340> indicates<00:03:13.939> that<00:03:14.060> there's

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
smoke that indicates that there's

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.780 
smoke that indicates that there's
another<00:03:14.689> fragment<00:03:15.139> there<00:03:15.290> and<00:03:15.650> those<00:03:16.579> guys

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
another fragment there and those guys

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.580 
another fragment there and those guys
are<00:03:16.819> guarding<00:03:17.269> it<00:03:17.389> so<00:03:17.720> I<00:03:17.930> need<00:03:18.349> to<00:03:18.409> come<00:03:18.500> up

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
are guarding it so I need to come up

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.500 
are guarding it so I need to come up
with<00:03:18.709> a<00:03:18.769> way<00:03:18.889> of<00:03:18.919> getting<00:03:19.730> over<00:03:19.939> there<00:03:20.239> and

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
with a way of getting over there and

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.309 
with a way of getting over there and
getting<00:03:20.930> them<00:03:21.049> away<00:03:21.290> from<00:03:23.049> getting<00:03:24.049> them<00:03:24.139> away

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
getting them away from getting them away

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:26.740 
getting them away from getting them away
from<00:03:24.439> that<00:03:24.620> piece<00:03:24.799> now<00:03:25.400> if<00:03:25.730> this<00:03:26.120> if<00:03:26.510> this
