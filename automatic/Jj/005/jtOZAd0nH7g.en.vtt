00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
and even then to tell our average at

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.990 
and even then to tell our average at
best<00:02:20.200> I<00:02:20.590> mean<00:02:20.620> there<00:02:21.130> are<00:02:21.190> right<00:02:21.550> but<00:02:21.820> at<00:02:21.910> the

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.020 

so<00:03:29.440> that<00:03:29.590> was<00:03:29.770> the<00:03:29.860> sense<00:03:30.160> but<00:03:30.490> what<00:03:30.730> about<00:03:30.910> the

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
so that was the sense but what about the

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:32.670 
so that was the sense but what about the

like that I mean they take out one of

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.400 
like that I mean they take out one of
the<00:03:36.820> most<00:03:37.000> interesting<00:03:37.300> fantasy<00:03:37.930> worlds<00:03:38.290> I've

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
the most interesting fantasy worlds I've

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:39.810 
the most interesting fantasy worlds I've
ever<00:03:38.620> seen<00:03:38.890> and<00:03:39.160> they<00:03:39.280> don't<00:03:39.490> use<00:03:39.640> it

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
ever seen and they don't use it

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.190 
ever seen and they don't use it
obviously<00:03:40.210> I'm<00:03:40.300> not<00:03:40.420> gonna<00:03:40.600> be<00:03:40.720> a<00:03:40.750> fan<00:03:40.930> of<00:03:41.080> it

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
obviously I'm not gonna be a fan of it

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.210 
obviously I'm not gonna be a fan of it
but<00:03:41.290> I<00:03:41.350> understand<00:03:41.740> why<00:03:41.860> did<00:03:41.920> did<00:03:42.190> that

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
but I understand why did did that

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.830 
but I understand why did did that
because<00:03:42.400> no<00:03:42.970> they're<00:03:43.120> trying<00:03:43.390> to<00:03:43.540> appeal<00:03:43.780> to
