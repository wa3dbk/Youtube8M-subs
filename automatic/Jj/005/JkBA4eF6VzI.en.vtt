these bugs

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.419 
these bugs
everywhere<00:02:09.679> in<00:02:09.860> there<00:02:10.009> they're<00:02:10.190> a<00:02:10.220> little

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
everywhere in there they're a little

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.180 
everywhere in there they're a little
harder<00:02:10.700> to<00:02:10.789> see<00:02:10.820> down<00:02:11.180> there<00:02:11.920> but<00:02:12.920> there's<00:02:13.100> a

harder to see down there but there's a

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.000

very good you can see you can see a lot
of<00:02:24.680> these<00:02:24.860> ones<00:02:25.100> the<00:02:25.250> ones<00:02:25.430> that<00:02:25.580> are<00:02:25.670> darker

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
of these ones the ones that are darker

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.750 
of these ones the ones that are darker
here<00:02:26.330> actually<00:02:26.840> still<00:02:27.140> wet<00:02:27.500> from<00:02:27.830> hatching

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
here actually still wet from hatching

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.600 
here actually still wet from hatching
last<00:02:29.180> night<00:02:29.480> so<00:02:30.470> early<00:02:30.860> in<00:02:30.980> the<00:02:31.070> morning<00:02:31.430> and

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
late the evening the dry fly fishing is

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.550 
late the evening the dry fly fishing is
incredible<00:02:33.950> but<00:02:34.310> uh<00:02:34.780> yeah<00:02:35.780> the<00:02:36.110> number<00:02:36.470> of

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
incredible but uh yeah the number of

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.250 
incredible but uh yeah the number of
those<00:02:36.709> the<00:02:37.190> number<00:02:37.430> of<00:02:37.520> bugs<00:02:37.730> there<00:02:38.000> is<00:02:38.260> pretty

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
those the number of bugs there is pretty

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.180 
those the number of bugs there is pretty
remarkable<00:02:41.080> and<00:02:42.080> see<00:02:42.260> how<00:02:42.410> this<00:02:42.560> guys<00:02:42.800> doing

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
remarkable and see how this guys doing

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.030 
remarkable and see how this guys doing
in<00:02:43.730> the<00:02:44.390> hatching<00:02:44.810> process<00:02:44.840> he's<00:02:45.650> still<00:02:45.860> kind

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
in the hatching process he's still kind

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.790 
in the hatching process he's still kind
of<00:02:46.220> distill<00:02:46.550> mate<00:02:47.170> he<00:02:48.170> might<00:02:48.410> need<00:02:48.560> a<00:02:48.620> little

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
of distill mate he might need a little

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:55.630 
of distill mate he might need a little
hand<00:02:49.930> getting<00:02:50.930> out<00:02:51.050> of<00:02:51.230> there<00:02:54.370> yeah<00:02:55.370> he's

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
hand getting out of there yeah he's

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.220 
hand getting out of there yeah he's
still<00:02:55.820> wrestling<00:02:56.239> around<00:02:56.420> with<00:02:56.540> that<00:02:59.230> it's

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
still wrestling around with that it's

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.750 
still wrestling around with that it's
pretty<00:03:00.470> neat<00:03:00.680> actually<00:03:00.950> Gooden<00:03:01.310> see<00:03:01.489> how<00:03:01.610> they

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
pretty neat actually Gooden see how they

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.220 
pretty neat actually Gooden see how they
had<00:03:01.940> she's<00:03:02.180> just<00:03:02.510> about<00:03:02.959> out<00:03:03.200> of<00:03:03.350> their<00:03:05.230> summer

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
had she's just about out of their summer

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.410 
had she's just about out of their summer
Stone<00:03:06.560> fly<00:03:06.830> so<00:03:07.730> this<00:03:07.820> would<00:03:07.940> call<00:03:08.090> the<00:03:08.180> short

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
Stone fly so this would call the short

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.210 
Stone fly so this would call the short
winged<00:03:08.660> stone<00:03:09.020> you<00:03:09.260> can<00:03:09.380> see<00:03:09.620> that<00:03:09.800> the<00:03:09.890> wings

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
winged stone you can see that the wings

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.390 
winged stone you can see that the wings
on<00:03:10.520> that<00:03:10.550> fly<00:03:11.650> and<00:03:12.650> we're<00:03:12.739> looking<00:03:12.980> at<00:03:13.070> the<00:03:13.160> tan

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
on that fly and we're looking at the tan

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.890 
on that fly and we're looking at the tan
one<00:03:13.640> of<00:03:13.760> the<00:03:13.820> one<00:03:13.940> that's<00:03:14.120> alive<00:03:14.360> the<00:03:14.630> wings

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
one of the one that's alive the wings

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.710 
one of the one that's alive the wings
are<00:03:15.140> very<00:03:15.170> very<00:03:15.799> short<00:03:16.250> they're<00:03:17.180> actually<00:03:17.630> not

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
are very very short they're actually not

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.210 
are very very short they're actually not
fully<00:03:17.989> matured<00:03:18.320> that<00:03:18.470> bug<00:03:18.680> won't<00:03:18.860> be<00:03:18.980> able<00:03:19.160> to

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
fully matured that bug won't be able to

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.070 
fully matured that bug won't be able to
fly<00:03:19.489> and<00:03:19.880> it's<00:03:20.090> probably<00:03:20.390> a<00:03:20.420> male<00:03:20.660> summer

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
fly and it's probably a male summer

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.100 
fly and it's probably a male summer
stone<00:03:21.940> typically<00:03:22.940> the<00:03:23.060> males<00:03:23.330> have<00:03:23.660> the<00:03:23.840> short

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
stone typically the males have the short

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.310 
stone typically the males have the short
wings<00:03:24.320> and<00:03:25.510> because<00:03:26.510> they<00:03:26.630> don't<00:03:26.840> need<00:03:26.989> to<00:03:27.080> fly

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
wings and because they don't need to fly

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.750 
wings and because they don't need to fly
out<00:03:27.560> into<00:03:27.950> the<00:03:28.040> middle<00:03:28.250> of<00:03:28.310> the<00:03:28.370> river<00:03:28.489> to<00:03:28.670> lay

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
out into the middle of the river to lay

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.220 
out into the middle of the river to lay
their<00:03:28.910> eggs<00:03:28.940> like<00:03:29.299> the<00:03:29.420> females<00:03:29.780> do<00:03:29.989> so<00:03:30.140> the

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
their eggs like the females do so the

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.550 
their eggs like the females do so the
males<00:03:30.440> hatch<00:03:30.709> it's<00:03:30.980> just<00:03:31.190> a<00:03:31.310> short<00:03:31.549> wing<00:03:32.560> but

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
males hatch it's just a short wing but

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.460 
males hatch it's just a short wing but
it's<00:03:33.739> a<00:03:34.299> yeah<00:03:35.299> very<00:03:35.540> neat<00:03:35.750> bug<00:03:35.930> that's<00:03:36.290> how

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
it's a yeah very neat bug that's how

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:37.660 
it's a yeah very neat bug that's how
they<00:03:36.590> hatch<00:03:36.739> they<00:03:37.010> crawl<00:03:37.190> out<00:03:37.220> to<00:03:37.430> the<00:03:37.489> bank

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
they hatch they crawl out to the bank

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.060 
they hatch they crawl out to the bank
they<00:03:37.970> shed<00:03:38.870> their<00:03:38.989> skin<00:03:39.049> much<00:03:39.530> like<00:03:39.709> a<00:03:39.739> snake

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
they shed their skin much like a snake

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:41.830 
they shed their skin much like a snake
would<00:03:40.280> and<00:03:40.549> the<00:03:40.790> big<00:03:40.940> bug<00:03:41.120> crawls<00:03:41.420> out<00:03:41.600> and

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
would and the big bug crawls out and

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.600 
would and the big bug crawls out and
he's<00:03:41.930> gonna<00:03:42.110> go<00:03:42.260> hide<00:03:42.440> somewhere<00:03:42.709> try<00:03:43.400> to<00:03:43.459> get

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
he's gonna go hide somewhere try to get

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.520 
he's gonna go hide somewhere try to get
away<00:03:43.670> from<00:03:43.790> the<00:03:43.970> birds<00:03:44.180> in<00:03:44.329> the<00:03:44.360> trout<00:03:44.660> soon<00:03:45.470> as

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
away from the birds in the trout soon as

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.950 
away from the birds in the trout soon as
he<00:03:45.590> gets<00:03:45.739> hatched
