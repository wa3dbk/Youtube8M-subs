00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:10.230
 a very special guest the luxury she 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.910
 is unique to that is the chaise of the 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.889
 doing the carmen you were going to prepare 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.930
 with us not clear then for that 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.710
 we are here and good morning in the 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:22.039
 kitchen we have 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.420
 special and the day very low outdoors 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.460
 and we are going to prepare 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.680
 If you are from Gicaman with a little bit of 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.119
 breaded shrimp from the bank us 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.369
 apart we explain to him that it is the bank is 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.930
 something very simple very fresh and fast 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:34.460
 do as always what good that 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.260
 you can explain what the bank is because 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.590
 I have no idea they have pen and mobil 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.760
 at home and then let the 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:45.110
 ingredients that will now be 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:47.390
 happening here below because they are very 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.760
 simple we continue between the bass and up 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:53.260
 the typical breaded while I 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.260
 I will explain what I know about bread 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:59.040
 we agreed on the egg we are going to use 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.310
 the three clear and yolk eggs and the 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.310
 areas 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.400
 of two graphs is what she is 

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:07.800
 helping empathize what is he 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.590
 so that it does not complicate me 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.659
 but this time they are having 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.039
 uses our japan to brew is 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.689
 some balls but Spain does not 

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:18.090
 complicate but that serves as advice 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.649
 it's dry bread but it does not strain if you see it but 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.539
 if it is bought as a bank, we prepare it 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:23.800
 here it called good bank and everything 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:24.910
 committed we can get it and the 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.020
 sorry are the conditions 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.840
 where there is forgiveness of asia 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.729
 very easy to get it 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.329
 to the pocket let's forget about the bank 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:34.329
 then why 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.290
 we buy bread that we have the 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.970
 Aro does not speak it, we do it like 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.680
 granny waiting for the hard bread and 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.880
 then he ground it in the metate 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.909
 surely not everyone has a 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.920
 metate me here I have an inventory 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.619
 and if we do not hit him with the kneading stick 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.190
 the hard bread in a plastic bag 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.260
 we are with the mallet and we do puntito 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.330
 we get into trouble we always have the 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.750
 blender that help us also the 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:02.000
 processor also does not leave it fast 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.270
 Well now what it does is pass it on 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.219
 year are here we have had 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.460
 to fernando is just doing here 

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:11.200
 I have to help a lot 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.550
 like I did not just move to the plate 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.160
 Monica that is asking me for the saucer 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.640
 scolding in front of her that is to say was 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.640
 feasible 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.490
 today and while I'm here to do 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.700
 activities we can make clear 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:27.090
 entities we go here for example that 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.090
 we have 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:33.100
 horseback riding mountain bike 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:35.940
 we have a friend there are masajitos 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.940
 from the back 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:45.819
 notice that the truth is cooking 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.380
 traditional Mexican with touches of the 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:51.830
 old kitchen 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:55.800
 there were recipes of yesteryear clear and the 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:57.720
 true with a special that we do here 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:01.460
 I did not white I had never heard mole 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:03.800
 white while the whites 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:06.590
 do not ask me strangle white is like 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.540
 similar to the wedding mole not in which the 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.100
 usually this way you can talk between 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.710
 the store and they leave me in a position 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.670
 advanced with him at least and now I do not know 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:15.200
 start to warm up a bit 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.000
 with more oil as we have some 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.360
 ants that are a bit complicated 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.700
 of free always complicates 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:25.000
 one day 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.739
 the autumn days in this region of 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.150
 jalisco we are in the valleys region 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:31.920
 you knew that we did not forget 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.700
 it's the region 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.840
 valleys although it is one of the most 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.130
 fertile 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:43.030
 in terms of agricultural production 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:44.170
 There are sugar mills we have energy 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.090
 real for all the people who are 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.600
 watching in studios for 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.910

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.519
 greenhouses 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:59.959
 where peppers are grown 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:03.370
 so much of what we eat here 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:03.370
 is done here they are produced 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.380
 and that they come from hunting 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:17.039
 and now more support the flowers 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:18.590
 Skype sustainability in involving the 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:22.449
 community 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.449
 and that they receive the benefits 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.920
 that's why the food is delicious 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.720
 sensational thanks so come on I left 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:34.460
 to the hacienda el carmen instants have 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.460
 work was started as a means 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.570
 but while you're not invited as a tuna 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.830
 shrimp pacotilla the shrimp castilla 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.550
 The characteristic of loops of 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.380
 Cooked shrimp 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.970
 is to embroil what is going to brown 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.200
 the outside but in reality they are already 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:51.180
 cooked because what we're going to do 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.180
 20 for the slices of the 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.849
 from jÃ­cama 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.770
 and we are going to cut it as in squares 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:05:00.080
 round is something a little bit that has 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.860
 like a toast we put then 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.990
 Now a little bed of 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.490
 and now that the shrimp that come out 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.689
 they are taking me a little bit let me see 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.689
 I already guessed the powers 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:17.419
 but do not go to burn very cute 

00:05:13.249 --> 00:05:18.810
 the sciences we have a layer on the skin 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:21.090
 for 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:24.840
 to the hot truth I do not say it no 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:26.880
 it's not done like this we can not grab what 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.160

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:34.800
 family without eating that does not 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:37.590
 s 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:40.440
 no no no no good because they imagine the 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:42.629
 mexican tostaditas and this knows 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.400
 delicious thing to do is put the 

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:45.930
 shrimp up when it's really hard 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.430
 and also if it did not last to last 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.409
 the stateroom that does not pass is not cooked 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.400

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:51.860
