00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 hello how about my name is elizabeth 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.410
 bonilla instructor of learn 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.930
 mathematics with exercises 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:12.200
 as part of the topic of reactions 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:14.480
 let's represent a fraction within 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.760
 of a number line very well 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:20.120
 let's continue 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:22.730
 we have the fraction one third and we are going to 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:26.029
 represent this fraction on a straight 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:29.630
 remember that the denominator 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:33.020
 tells us in how many parts are we going to 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:36.290
 divide the whole and the numerator we 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:40.680
 says how many parts are we going to use like this 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:44.060
 that for example if the whole has 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.060
 three parts 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:51.970
 the numerator is telling us that we are going 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:55.420
 to use one of them or one third 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:59.350
 to represent a third on a straight 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:02.879
 numerical we do the following 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:09.640
 very well we draw the number line 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:14.650
 we put a piece two pieces three 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:17.740
 pieces and here we will have the 1 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:21.590
 the next whole we already have a piece 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:25.240
 two pieces three pieces 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.240
 and here we are going to have 2 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:34.890
 a piece two pieces three pieces and 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:38.250
 here we are going to have the 3 so 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:42.180
 particular number line is going to have 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:45.780
 3 whole if you are asking for a third 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:48.360
 it means that we are going to use a 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.479
 third of an integer because the whole 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:55.080
 it would be three thirds ok 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:59.789
 so we have here that this will be 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:02.100
 our point or this part is never 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:05.399
 mark this section here because this 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.250
 means zero very well so it would be 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:11.940
 here we are going to do another exercise 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.980
 we have the fraction three quarters that 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.620
 means that each whole is going to have 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:20.230
 four parts very well let's make a 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:25.370
 small number line 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:31.159
 then we have to put here 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:32.720
 a piece two three four and then there 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:36.920
 we have 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:42.320
 a whole very well then we have a 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:44.830
 piece two three pieces and there 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.830
 we have 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:50.990
 our second whole 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:54.600
 and then he is asking us three 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:57.060
 rooms that means that it does not reach 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:02.040
 whole completely true so 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:05.710
 we have 123 pieces which means that 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:08.820
 our point will be here 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.820
 this means 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.950
 3 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.690
 rooms 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:21.410
 very well let's do now another 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:24.440
 example we have the fraction 9 on 4 or 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:27.890
 be 9 rooms let's make our 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:30.170
 number line that means that each 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:33.310
 whole is going to have 4 parts so 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.310
 we have 1 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:42.830
 234 parts and there we have a whole 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.830
 then we have 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:54.040
 234 parts and here we have our 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:58.620
 whole and we're going to make one more whole 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.620
 more so we have one 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:10.600
 234 parts and we have our third 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:14.530
 whole then let's see now to 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:18.090
 how much reduces the nine quarters then 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.090
 what we do is that we divide 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:27.040
 numerator in denominator outside 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:33.220
 how many times to fit 4 in the 92 times 2 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:36.419
 for 48 we subtract and we have 1 remind 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:39.460
 that this number up here is the 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:46.150
 whole so our result is going to 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:49.800
 be 9 quarters equals 2 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.800
 and a quarter 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:56.110
 fourth so if we are going to represent 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:59.640
 on the number line we look for the 2 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:03.590
 whole and a quarter or that is here 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:05.350
 would be great 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.070
 our number 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:10.030
 2 and 1 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:10.030
 quarter 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:16.130
