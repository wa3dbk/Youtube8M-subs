00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:10.309
 I will make the recipe for my white rice that 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:13.679
 asked for a friend on facebook and 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:16.130
 taking advantage of today I cooked them I'm 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.710
 recording this recipe stay to see it 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:22.400
 thanks for being here and well I hope and 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.400
 like it 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.289
 good girls for this white rice 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:32.179
 I will be using 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.179
 two and a half cups of rice 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:40.670
 three quarts of water to liquefy this and 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.989
 I'm just going to occupy these two little pieces of 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.989
 onion the garlic 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:50.200
 laurel leaves to give it flavor is not 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:53.890
 complicated do not think you there are 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:56.770
 how rough is that difficult is not right 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.750
 the easiest thing in the world for the girl who 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.930
 he asked me that he is just beginning to 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:04.290
 I'm going to cook this recipe 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:07.290
 white rice 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.090
 This is preferably for moles 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.070
 for meals that are very 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.130
 flavored that what accompanies them 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.850
 with white rice we are going to liquefy the 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.850
 onion 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.750
 the two basses with the three quarters of 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.980
 Water 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:29.430
 is what we are going to liquefy to throw it 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.430
 to rice 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:36.600
 well I'm going to preheat my oil a 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.820
 trickle and you 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.020
 they will know what song they are going to put 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:45.030
 use my wooden pallet 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.030
 and there I will add my rice 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:53.870
 Many people see it red but I do not 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:57.080
 I do because we do not need the starch 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:02:00.580
 which makes rice powder 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:06.110
 then we are going to 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:08.950
 about going but not completely only 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.950
 a little 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:16.030
 what is completely golden but 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:16.030
 little bit 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:23.390
 and so we will continue to suffer 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:28.840
 until we see that the rice starts 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.840
 to put white or golden white 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:37.350
 carefully so that it does not stick too 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.350
 accomplished 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:45.600
 since we see that it is a bit white 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:48.440
 let's add what we liquefy that the 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.440
 onion and garlic 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.470
 I just 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:06.680
 and we add the laurel quote so that 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:11.079
 start grabbing the flavor of your kitchen 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.079
 of laurel with games also web 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.790
 and we put salt 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.760
 how 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.250
 since it integrates well what the game 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.630
 we have to respect a little 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:41.110
 the feet to be worth our rice 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:50.590
 we add water and this is the 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:53.400
 amount of water but gravity 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.400
 we take more 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.940
 we put it on 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:01.780
 we just need our rum to be 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.780
 discover 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:11.060
 certify salt that is well salt 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.510
 and if we do not add a little 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:23.120
 of rice I want you to be very active 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:28.100
 installed 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:30.139
 and well we let it boil and 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.580
 they can put a lid and I do not have a lid 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:33.800
 from my 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:38.720
 it's art I'm going to put it from hologic to that 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:41.420
 I have and we hope old policy 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:44.210
 very important girls very flight to fire 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:46.780
 slow so that the sponge rice more 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.780
 beautiful 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.030
 and good girls here we are going to see that 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:55.730
 our rice is almost going to be 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:58.090
 Remember that simmered so that 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:01.560
 sponge and cap 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:04.240
 And then we took those twigs off 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:07.020
 laurel so that it is completely 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:10.190
 talk or wait another moment and you take and 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:13.430
 it will be ready 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:17.080
 good lovely see my rice already 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.080

 I'm going to cover it to leave it there 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:30.240
