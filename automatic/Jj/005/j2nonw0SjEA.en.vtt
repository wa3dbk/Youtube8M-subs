Android compares with windows seven

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.610 
Android compares with windows seven
maybe<00:02:56.420> five<00:02:56.690> ten<00:02:56.870> percent<00:02:57.170> but<00:02:57.260> nothing<00:02:57.500> more

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
maybe five ten percent but nothing more

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.770 
maybe five ten percent but nothing more
than<00:02:57.680> that<00:02:58.240> let's<00:02:59.240> go<00:02:59.330> to<00:02:59.390> the<00:02:59.570> home<00:02:59.750> screen

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780

again see what other other things we've

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.940 
again see what other other things we've
got<00:03:03.940> standard<00:03:04.940> Android<00:03:05.330> build<00:03:05.510> its<00:03:05.750> 1.6<00:03:06.560> I'm

not<00:03:07.010> sure<00:03:07.070> the<00:03:07.460> memory<00:03:08.360> is<00:03:08.540> on<00:03:08.870> it<00:03:09.020> let's<00:03:09.200> see

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
not sure the memory is on it let's see

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.690 
not sure the memory is on it let's see
if<00:03:09.380> we<00:03:09.500> can<00:03:09.680> just<00:03:10.130> quickly<00:03:10.790> check<00:03:11.150> the<00:03:11.500> memory

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
if we can just quickly check the memory

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:18.370 
if we can just quickly check the memory
or<00:03:13.700> the<00:03:13.880> details<00:03:16.870> yeah<00:03:17.870> we<00:03:17.990> don't<00:03:18.140> have<00:03:18.260> those

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
or the details yeah we don't have those

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.640 
or the details yeah we don't have those
details<00:03:18.890> here<00:03:19.330> monkey<00:03:20.330> ok<00:03:20.870> 1<00:03:21.080> gig<00:03:21.230> of<00:03:21.320> ram<00:03:21.380> on

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
details here monkey ok 1 gig of ram on

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.180 
details here monkey ok 1 gig of ram on
is<00:03:21.770> the<00:03:22.130> 16<00:03:22.550> gig<00:03:22.670> SSD<00:03:23.060> 16<00:03:23.720> gig<00:03:24.080> built<00:03:24.410> in<00:03:24.590> SS<00:03:24.980> is

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
is the 16 gig SSD 16 gig built in SS is

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:31.600 
is the 16 gig SSD 16 gig built in SS is
their<00:03:25.760> memories<00:03:26.240> ddr3<00:03:27.050> ok<00:03:27.800> fast<00:03:28.700> fast

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.840 

and<00:03:32.110> and<00:03:33.110> we<00:03:33.290> think<00:03:33.530> it's<00:03:33.740> built<00:03:33.980> on<00:03:34.190> yeah

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
and and we think it's built on yeah

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.950 
and and we think it's built on yeah
android<00:03:35.750> x86<00:03:36.020> project<00:03:37.510> it<00:03:38.510> looks<00:03:38.720> fairly

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:38.960 
android x86 project it looks fairly

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.160 
android x86 project it looks fairly
stand<00:03:39.470> at<00:03:39.710> the<00:03:39.770> moment<00:03:40.630> so<00:03:41.630> this<00:03:41.780> is<00:03:41.810> kind<00:03:42.110> of

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
stand at the moment so this is kind of

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.050 
stand at the moment so this is kind of
interesting<00:03:42.470> it<00:03:42.770> boots<00:03:42.950> fast<00:03:43.340> into<00:03:43.670> android

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
interesting it boots fast into android

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.440 
interesting it boots fast into android
and<00:03:44.360> of<00:03:44.900> course<00:03:45.110> it<00:03:45.230> gives<00:03:45.320> you<00:03:45.500> a<00:03:45.530> nice<00:03:45.620> simple

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
and of course it gives you a nice simple

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.330 
and of course it gives you a nice simple
user<00:03:47.450> experience<00:03:48.200> so<00:03:48.590> let's<00:03:48.740> see<00:03:48.890> if<00:03:48.980> we<00:03:49.100> can

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
user experience so let's see if we can

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.830 
user experience so let's see if we can
test<00:03:49.790> out<00:03:50.030> windows<00:03:50.690> seven<00:03:51.050> on<00:03:51.110> this<00:03:51.320> now

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.290 

okay<00:03:54.840> here<00:03:55.020> see<00:03:55.230> the<00:03:56.030> operating<00:03:57.030> system

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
okay here see the operating system

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.940 
okay here see the operating system
choice<00:03:57.570> windows<00:03:58.020> 7<00:03:58.320> we're<00:03:58.410> going<00:03:58.530> to<00:03:58.590> go<00:03:58.710> for

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
choice windows 7 we're going to go for

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.800 
choice windows 7 we're going to go for
here<00:03:59.280> let's<00:03:59.790> see<00:03:59.970> how<00:04:00.060> long<00:04:00.120> that<00:04:00.270> takes<00:04:00.600> the

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
here let's see how long that takes the

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.770 
here let's see how long that takes the
boot<00:04:01.050> should<00:04:01.620> be<00:04:01.680> fairly<00:04:02.300> standard<00:04:03.300> boot<00:04:03.480> time

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
boot should be fairly standard boot time

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.950 
boot should be fairly standard boot time
so<00:04:04.290> 40<00:04:05.220> to<00:04:05.340> 60<00:04:05.700> seconds<00:04:06.210> windows<00:04:06.540> seven

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:06.960 
so 40 to 60 seconds windows seven

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:11.660 
so 40 to 60 seconds windows seven
letters<00:04:07.140> home<00:04:07.320> premium<00:04:07.770> and<00:04:10.190> it's<00:04:11.190> a<00:04:11.310> one<00:04:11.520> gig

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670
