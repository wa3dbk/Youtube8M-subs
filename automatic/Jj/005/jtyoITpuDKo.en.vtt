00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.470
 In this work here we have a photo. 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.599
 from Sara made on the cell phone 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.420
 let's point from here some 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.420
 important tips to improve these 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.640
 photos for example the use of the arm 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.579
 the way the hair is trimmed the angle 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.070
 from face to chin level and even 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.989
 the cut the framing things you 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.520
 You can do at home with your cell phone. 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.340
 The first tip I'm going to pass 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.379
 to loosen the hair and a basic way 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:54.690
 to pack our hair to use the photo 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:56.610
 be in favor very well 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.370
 The first tip regarding hair is 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.960
 how divides hair is very common 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.399
 catch your hair all over 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.949
 behind you have a hair a little 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:08.850
 the ideal is not to let the 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:11.070
 hair fill the photo screen it's you 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.200
 divide and then pull the 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.439
 hair on one side another part on 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.390
 front it divide the hair that goes 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.830
 also decrease the volume in the 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.590
 rear 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.430
 The first tip the second tip is to 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.560
 make up 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.049
 Good if you're going to do a self portrait at 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.659
 home, you're not going to do that makeup 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.670
 of ballad will do a light makeup 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.729
 I usually say daylight makeup 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.340
 that makeup that will stay light goes 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.900
 help your face instead of working 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.450
 as a mask make small 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:47.340
 corrections with the children 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:50.549
 a not too expressive lipstick is to correct 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.829
 a little bit of oeiras and mainly 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:56.219
 the basis of this 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:58.200
 Basic makeup, there's nothing like a party. 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.810
 self-portrait has to be somehow 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.030
 light makeup makeup of the day is what 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.560
 I recommend the third tip has to do 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.229
 with the location you will choose to 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.590
 make this photo and 20 place with lots of 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.140
 local information 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.569
 very polluted the subject of the photo is you 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.260
 So you have to be the highlight in this 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.150
 Photograph 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.540
 avoid using accessories such as chairs 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:22.060
 sofas each do a simple thing and 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:26.170
 so you're going to look better and your photo 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.819
 will get fourth cleanest tip pose and 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.110
 the angle you are going to use to 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.360
 position in the photo 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.620
 good if you are a model who has a body 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.560
 a little wider 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.599
 avoid using with the shoulder completely 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.239
 this will make it appear that you 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:42.640
 is slightly larger than that the 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.019
 own camera does not matter the model up 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.530
 even a professional 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:49.120
 She already makes that change so I'll 2015 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.180
 the shoulder on the side 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:55.180
 something that is very charming to 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.900
 A self portrait is to bring the chin 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.790
 shoulder 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.459
 Something like you doing here. 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.769
 now if you observe the 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.959
 hair appeared only part here 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:07.239
 another part looked so in that 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:11.079
 moment and wipe the face from the other side 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:12.910
 has a little already approved turned this 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:15.790
 an honorable position is a basic and 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.769
 will look good fifth good tip is 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.560
 normal that you with your cell phone at home 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:22.930
 Your camera, what are you going to do and photos? 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.940
 it's also normal you'll post almost 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.389
 all photos of the doctor 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.829
 After you make all the photos, okay? 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:32.230
 select the photos you can up to 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:34.060
 seek to imitate something of a magazine 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.609
 something that is closer to the 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.010
 that people are used to seeing 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:41.950
 select make 15 photos take three photos 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:44.380
 best and put it there on your profile 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:47.200
 the model takes a photo to put on the 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:49.569
 profile site she needs to show how 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.060
 she is naturally a makeup does 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:55.120
 small corrections necessary for a 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.280
 self-portrait this ideal makeup for 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.150
 day is not a party ball fall 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.250
 at night 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.630
 the makeup in which the producer can 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.079
 identify the main 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.700
 features of the model face 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:08.560
 using your phone or smartphone as 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.220
 This you can do at home. 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.810
 Pretty elaborate and simple photos 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:16.530
 using here is our wing models 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.840
 but let's give some tips 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.650
 how to use the 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.109
 cell phone 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.010
 the angle and mainly as 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:26.480
 express 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:30.270
 in this self portrait photo the famous self 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:32.790
 The first tip is about which camera 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:36.840
 Your cell phone you use is very common. 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:39.480
 in self portrait you use the camera 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:42.180
 the front so you can see yourself while 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:44.280
 What happens is that 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.389
 smartphone the cameras are 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.280
 many different 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:49.650
 the back camera has a quality 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.270
 better then I recommend that you use 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.820
 always the camera behind 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.419
 even though it is difficult to tighten the 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.760
 button 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:57.660
 The second tip is about the angle of the 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:01.430
 portrait 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:05.250
 the ideal is that you avoid using the cell phone 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:07.380
 above the forehead or below 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:11.970
 always use at the time of the 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:13.440
 face the third tip use maluhy window 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:16.200
 to eliminate your face 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:20.610
 phone between you and the 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:22.530
 fourth window tip avoid making the 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.479
 Your photo is looking for a very 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:26.190
 polluted with lots of information many 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:28.470
 elements in the background you should look for 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.270
 also harmonize the clothes you are wearing 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.280
 using with the color of the background a good 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:35.220
 practice is to wear two-tone clothing 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:38.400
 black and avoid using clothes 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:40.280
 with prints fifth and last tip a 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.900
 side of face is never the same as the other 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.770
 search your best angle by taking photos 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:46.050
 on both sides 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.610
 good practice is also to use references 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:49.740
 Photo of view 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:51.390
 That's good folks, I hope you guys 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.700
 have enjoyed if they will have any 

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:55.970
 doubt that they would like more information
