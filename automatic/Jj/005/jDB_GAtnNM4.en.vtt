losses<00:03:31.130> we've<00:03:31.250> ever<00:03:31.489> had<00:03:31.700> in<00:03:31.850> a<00:03:31.910> battle<00:03:32.209> like

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
losses we've ever had in a battle like

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.060 
losses we've ever had in a battle like
this<00:03:32.360> I<00:03:32.840> guess<00:03:33.410> I<00:03:33.560> just<00:03:33.590> thought<00:03:33.799> he<00:03:33.950> was

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
this I guess I just thought he was

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:35.620 
this I guess I just thought he was
stronger<00:03:34.549> he's<00:03:34.910> like<00:03:35.060> the<00:03:35.180> Loch<00:03:35.390> Ness<00:03:35.420> monster

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
stronger he's like the Loch Ness monster

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.479 
stronger he's like the Loch Ness monster
I<00:03:36.170> feel<00:03:36.200> like<00:03:36.560> he<00:03:36.650> should<00:03:36.799> be<00:03:36.830> like<00:03:37.070> the<00:03:37.190> size

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
I feel like he should be like the size

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:39.789 
I feel like he should be like the size
of<00:03:37.670> the<00:03:37.760> arena<00:03:38.030> that'd<00:03:38.870> be<00:03:39.019> awesome<00:03:39.170> but<00:03:39.739> a

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799
