hi<00:00:04.800> this<00:00:05.760> video<00:00:06.150> is<00:00:06.450> going<00:00:06.930> to<00:00:06.990> be<00:00:07.050> an<00:00:07.200> overview

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
hi this video is going to be an overview

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:15.290 
hi this video is going to be an overview
of<00:00:08.130> the<00:00:08.520> reflexes<00:00:09.299> of<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:09.960> brainstem<00:00:14.300> so

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:15.300 
of the reflexes of the brainstem so

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.970 
of the reflexes of the brainstem so
first<00:00:15.630> of<00:00:15.750> all<00:00:15.840> let's<00:00:16.290> have<00:00:16.529> a<00:00:16.560> look<00:00:16.740> at<00:00:16.860> an

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
first of all let's have a look at an

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:24.170 
first of all let's have a look at an
outline<00:00:17.550> of<00:00:17.790> how<00:00:18.270> a<00:00:18.300> reflex<00:00:18.930> works<00:00:23.090> here's<00:00:24.090> a

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
outline of how a reflex works here's a

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.790 
outline of how a reflex works here's a
brain<00:00:25.130> and<00:00:26.960> then<00:00:27.960> hanging<00:00:28.259> down<00:00:28.529> off<00:00:28.680> the

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
brain and then hanging down off the

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.960 
brain and then hanging down off the
bottom<00:00:29.099> is<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.640> brainstem<00:00:30.239> so<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:31.169> reflex

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:31.970 
bottom is the brainstem so a reflex

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.950 
bottom is the brainstem so a reflex
involves<00:00:32.970> two<00:00:33.630> nerves<00:00:35.059> one<00:00:36.059> which<00:00:36.300> enters<00:00:36.780> the

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
involves two nerves one which enters the

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.229 
involves two nerves one which enters the
brainstem<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:37.679> one<00:00:38.280> which<00:00:38.579> exits<00:00:39.120> the

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
brainstem and one which exits the

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.639 
brainstem and one which exits the
brainstem<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:41.449> possibly<00:00:42.449> a<00:00:42.750> bunch<00:00:43.199> of<00:00:43.410> nerves

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
brainstem and possibly a bunch of nerves

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.300 
brainstem and possibly a bunch of nerves
in<00:00:43.949> between<00:00:47.480> so<00:00:48.480> with<00:00:48.629> stimuli

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:49.310 
in between so with stimuli

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.210 
in between so with stimuli
is<00:00:49.460> applied<00:00:49.850> to<00:00:50.420> the<00:00:50.570> incoming<00:00:51.380> nerve<00:00:51.890> and

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:52.220 
is applied to the incoming nerve and

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.750 
is applied to the incoming nerve and
this<00:00:52.850> we<00:00:53.030> call<00:00:53.270> the<00:00:54.050> afferent<00:00:54.860> nerve<00:00:55.250> that's

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
this we call the afferent nerve that's

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:03.650 
this we call the afferent nerve that's
afferent<00:00:56.360> with<00:00:56.600> an<00:00:56.750> A<00:01:01.660> this<00:01:02.660> is<00:01:02.720> also<00:01:03.020> known<00:01:03.350> as

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
afferent with an A this is also known as

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:13.760 
afferent with an A this is also known as
sensory<00:01:04.230> nerve<00:01:10.880> now<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.720> signal<00:01:13.200> travels

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
sensory nerve now the signal travels

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:20.380 
sensory nerve now the signal travels
into<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.760> brain<00:01:15.240> stem<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:18.620> the<00:01:19.620> brain<00:01:19.860> stem

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
into the brain stem and the brain stem

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.320 
into the brain stem and the brain stem
processes<00:01:21.390> this<00:01:21.990> signal<00:01:22.820> so<00:01:23.820> this<00:01:24.000> is<00:01:24.150> the

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
processes this signal so this is the

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:33.200 
processes this signal so this is the
processing<00:01:24.960> center<00:01:29.900> then<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:32.210> afferent

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
processing center then the afferent

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.370 
processing center then the afferent
nerve<00:01:33.570> that's<00:01:34.140> different<00:01:34.979> with<00:01:35.250> an<00:01:35.369> E<00:01:35.759> or<00:01:36.450> the

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
nerve that's different with an E or the

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:44.660 
nerve that's different with an E or the
motor<00:01:37.770> nerve<00:01:42.110> carries<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.320> signal<00:01:43.890> out<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.130> the

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
motor nerve carries a signal out of the

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:52.910 
motor nerve carries a signal out of the
brain<00:01:44.880> stem<00:01:48.289> to<00:01:49.289> a<00:01:49.320> muscle

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.760 

and<00:01:53.009> causes<00:01:53.880> muscular<00:01:54.420> contraction<00:01:57.560> so<00:01:58.560> the

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
and causes muscular contraction so the

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.889 
and causes muscular contraction so the
signal<00:01:59.130> travels<00:01:59.520> out<00:01:59.700> of<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.180> brainstem<00:02:00.720> and

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
signal travels out of the brainstem and

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:10.160 
signal travels out of the brainstem and
down<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.229> muscle<00:02:07.880> so<00:02:08.880> all<00:02:09.060> reflexes<00:02:09.720> work

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
down to the muscle so all reflexes work

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.000 
down to the muscle so all reflexes work
in<00:02:10.500> some<00:02:11.250> way<00:02:11.280> like<00:02:11.459> this<00:02:12.000> and<00:02:12.620> there<00:02:13.620> are<00:02:13.739> five

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
in some way like this and there are five

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.280 
in some way like this and there are five
reflexes<00:02:14.819> that<00:02:15.060> we'll<00:02:15.270> be<00:02:15.390> looking<00:02:15.569> at<00:02:15.870> in<00:02:16.050> the

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
reflexes that we'll be looking at in the

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:23.089 
reflexes that we'll be looking at in the
next<00:02:16.319> videos<00:02:20.900> these<00:02:21.900> are<00:02:21.959> all<00:02:22.410> reflexes<00:02:23.069> of

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
next videos these are all reflexes of

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:24.050 
next videos these are all reflexes of
the<00:02:23.310> brainstem

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
the brainstem

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
the brainstem
the<00:02:24.720> first<00:02:25.019> is<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.440> pupillary<00:02:25.890> light<00:02:26.250> reflex

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
the first is the pupillary light reflex

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.500 
the first is the pupillary light reflex
which<00:02:28.080> changes<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.830> pupil<00:02:29.190> size<00:02:29.430> on<00:02:30.060> exposure

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
which changes the pupil size on exposure

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.460 
which changes the pupil size on exposure
to<00:02:30.660> light<00:02:31.130> the<00:02:32.130> corneal<00:02:32.640> reflex<00:02:33.180> which<00:02:33.959> causes

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
to light the corneal reflex which causes

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.500 
to light the corneal reflex which causes
the<00:02:34.620> eye<00:02:34.650> to<00:02:34.769> blink<00:02:35.250> when<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:35.940> cornea<00:02:36.330> is

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
the eye to blink when the cornea is

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:42.740 
the eye to blink when the cornea is
touched<00:02:36.890> the<00:02:37.890> Capri<00:02:38.459> flex

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.870 

the<00:02:43.750> gag<00:02:44.080> reflex<00:02:44.440> which<00:02:45.130> protects<00:02:45.700> the

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
the gag reflex which protects the

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.770 
the gag reflex which protects the
pharynx<00:02:46.300> and<00:02:48.600> the<00:02:49.600> vestibular<00:02:50.050> ocular<00:02:50.410> reflex

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
pharynx and the vestibular ocular reflex

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.390 
pharynx and the vestibular ocular reflex
which<00:02:52.780> keeps<00:02:53.080> your<00:02:53.230> eyes<00:02:53.440> level<00:02:53.860> as<00:02:54.010> your<00:02:54.220> head

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
which keeps your eyes level as your head

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:02.250 
which keeps your eyes level as your head
moves<00:02:59.880> we'll<00:03:00.880> be<00:03:01.000> looking<00:03:01.120> at<00:03:01.360> these<00:03:01.510> reflexes

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
moves we'll be looking at these reflexes
