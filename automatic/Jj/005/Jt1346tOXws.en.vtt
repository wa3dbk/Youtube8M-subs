00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
piece and then what happens from there

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:44.840 
piece and then what happens from there
is<00:01:39.229> when<00:01:40.229> you<00:01:40.380> go<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:41.509> take<00:01:42.509> this<00:01:43.549> and<00:01:44.549> adjust

is when you go to take this and adjust

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.249 
is when you go to take this and adjust

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
it and bring it down

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.490 
it and bring it down
it<00:01:46.530> won't<00:01:46.710> do<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.880> gets<00:01:48.689> binded<00:01:49.110> up<00:01:49.229> here

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
it won't do it it gets binded up here

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.160 
it won't do it it gets binded up here
and<00:01:49.850> you<00:01:50.850> can<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.270> can<00:01:51.329> barely<00:01:51.750> move<00:01:51.930> this

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
and you can you can barely move this

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.160 
and you can you can barely move this
thing<00:01:52.409> so<00:01:53.030> this<00:01:54.030> is<00:01:54.210> showing<00:01:54.420> four<00:01:54.780> we've<00:01:55.140> got

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
thing so this is showing four we've got

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.690 
thing so this is showing four we've got
about<00:01:55.380> three<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:55.799> quarter<00:01:55.979> from<00:01:56.250> blade<00:01:56.520> to

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
about three and a quarter from blade to

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.569 
about three and a quarter from blade to
ground<00:01:57.000> we're<00:01:57.780> maxed<00:01:58.200> out<00:01:58.350> on<00:01:58.619> there<00:01:59.310> and

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
ground we're maxed out on there and

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.209 
ground we're maxed out on there and
that's<00:02:00.030> where<00:02:00.210> my<00:02:00.360> ribbon<00:02:00.659> issues<00:02:00.990> are<00:02:01.229> so<00:02:01.619> the

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
that's where my ribbon issues are so the

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
you can get four inches height from

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.839 
you can get four inches height from
blade<00:02:09.660> tip<00:02:09.929> to<00:02:10.140> ground<00:02:10.440> when<00:02:11.160> that<00:02:11.370> levers<00:02:11.730> in

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
blade tip to ground when that levers in

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.300 
blade tip to ground when that levers in
the<00:02:11.940> number<00:02:12.150> four<00:02:12.330> position

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
the number four position

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.550 
the number four position
and<00:02:13.400> happening<00:02:13.849> on<00:02:13.940> this<00:02:14.060> model<00:02:14.360> so<00:02:14.720> there<00:02:15.470> you

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
and happening on this model so there you
