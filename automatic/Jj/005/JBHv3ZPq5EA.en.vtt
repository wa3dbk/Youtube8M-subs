00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.260 
like it's gonna break or snap at all
because<00:02:10.410> these<00:02:10.770> are<00:02:10.979> made<00:02:11.129> of<00:02:11.280> metal<00:02:11.430> that

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
because these are made of metal that

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.330 
because these are made of metal that
doesn't<00:02:12.569> mean<00:02:12.660> that

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
doesn't mean that

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.490 
doesn't mean that
really<00:02:13.790> adds<00:02:13.970> to<00:02:14.270> the<00:02:14.390> overall<00:02:14.420> weight<00:02:15.140> and<00:02:15.410> I

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
really adds to the overall weight and I

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.930 
really adds to the overall weight and I
did<00:02:15.709> notice<00:02:15.920> that<00:02:16.040> after<00:02:16.220> wearing<00:02:16.489> these<00:02:16.700> for

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
did notice that after wearing these for

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.120 
did notice that after wearing these for
a<00:02:16.970> good<00:02:17.180> amount<00:02:17.330> of<00:02:17.450> time<00:02:17.690> or<00:02:18.349> I<00:02:18.470> did<00:02:18.709> feel<00:02:18.920> I'm

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
a good amount of time or I did feel I'm

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.250 
a good amount of time or I did feel I'm
pressing<00:02:19.580> down<00:02:19.610> on<00:02:20.150> my<00:02:20.690> head<00:02:20.900> a<00:02:20.959> little<00:02:21.110> bit

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
pressing down on my head a little bit

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.650 
pressing down on my head a little bit
now<00:02:21.620> I<00:02:21.650> think<00:02:21.860> that<00:02:22.010> was<00:02:22.160> because<00:02:22.520> it<00:02:23.180> was<00:02:23.420> one

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
now I think that was because it was one

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.229 
now I think that was because it was one
of<00:02:23.720> my<00:02:23.780> first<00:02:23.989> times<00:02:24.260> wearing<00:02:24.860> these<00:02:25.010> and<00:02:25.430> I

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
of my first times wearing these and I

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:27.760 
of my first times wearing these and I
think<00:02:26.480> it's<00:02:26.690> something<00:02:26.930> that<00:02:27.080> you'd<00:02:27.380> get<00:02:27.590> used

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
think it's something that you'd get used

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.890 
think it's something that you'd get used
to<00:02:28.010> after<00:02:28.340> a<00:02:28.849> while<00:02:28.910> just<00:02:29.330> like<00:02:29.510> any<00:02:29.720> other

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
to after a while just like any other

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.509 
to after a while just like any other
pair<00:02:30.230> of<00:02:30.440> headphones<00:02:31.780> also<00:02:32.780> one<00:02:33.410> of<00:02:33.440> the<00:02:33.650> main

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
pair of headphones also one of the main

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:37.780 
pair of headphones also one of the main
new<00:02:35.120> features<00:02:35.150> of<00:02:35.780> this<00:02:36.230> design<00:02:36.590> are<00:02:37.069> these

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
new features of this design are these

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.110 
new features of this design are these
flip<00:02:38.209> back<00:02:38.450> ear<00:02:38.750> cups<00:02:39.080> and<00:02:39.410> to<00:02:40.310> any<00:02:40.550> other<00:02:40.700> DJ's

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
this is probably one of the most

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.729 
this is probably one of the most
convenient<00:02:44.360> features<00:02:44.930> reason<00:02:45.440> being<00:02:45.560> is

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
dollar studio headphones such as a

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.050 
dollar studio headphones such as a
couple<00:04:09.470> of<00:04:09.530> Sennheiser<00:04:09.950> that<00:04:10.370> I've<00:04:10.519> used<00:04:10.790> and

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
couple of Sennheiser that I've used and

couple of Sennheiser that I've used and
audio<00:04:11.840> Technica's<00:04:12.440> one<00:04:13.280> thing<00:04:13.519> though<00:04:13.760> is

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
audio Technica's one thing though is

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:15.430 
audio Technica's one thing though is
that<00:04:14.269> I<00:04:14.480> noticed<00:04:14.780> that<00:04:14.900> the<00:04:14.989> bass<00:04:15.170> would

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
that I noticed that the bass would

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.770 
that I noticed that the bass would
sometimes<00:04:15.709> overlap<00:04:16.700> the<00:04:17.030> mids<00:04:17.269> and<00:04:17.479> the<00:04:17.600> highs

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
sometimes overlap the mids and the highs

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.190 
sometimes overlap the mids and the highs
and<00:04:18.530> since<00:04:19.340> these<00:04:19.549> are<00:04:19.850> reference<00:04:20.690> headphones

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
and since these are reference headphones

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.170 
and since these are reference headphones
I<00:04:21.560> think<00:04:22.070> that<00:04:22.190> monster<00:04:22.640> should<00:04:22.880> have<00:04:22.970> done<00:04:23.150> a

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
I think that monster should have done a

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.629 
I think that monster should have done a
better<00:04:23.510> job

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:24.639 
better job

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:27.149 
better job
really<00:04:24.849> maintaining<00:04:25.599> equilibrium<00:04:26.159> between

00:04:27.149 --> 00:04:27.159 
really maintaining equilibrium between

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:30.899 
really maintaining equilibrium between
the<00:04:27.939> bass<00:04:28.150> the<00:04:28.659> mids<00:04:28.900> and<00:04:29.199> the<00:04:29.979> highs<00:04:30.099> if

00:04:30.899 --> 00:04:30.909 
the bass the mids and the highs if

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:33.360 
the bass the mids and the highs if
you're<00:04:31.780> a<00:04:31.810> easy<00:04:32.319> listener<00:04:32.860> and<00:04:33.069> you<00:04:33.189> don't

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
you're a easy listener and you don't

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:34.769 
you're a easy listener and you don't
listen<00:04:33.520> to<00:04:33.699> songs<00:04:33.939> with<00:04:34.150> that<00:04:34.300> much<00:04:34.479> space

00:04:34.769 --> 00:04:34.779 
listen to songs with that much space

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:37.439 
listen to songs with that much space
then<00:04:35.349> I<00:04:35.469> don't<00:04:35.710> think<00:04:35.800> the<00:04:36.099> beats<00:04:36.340> pro<00:04:36.879> would

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:37.449 
then I don't think the beats pro would

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:39.629 
then I don't think the beats pro would
be<00:04:37.599> the<00:04:37.749> right<00:04:37.930> choice<00:04:38.229> for<00:04:38.259> you<00:04:38.800> though<00:04:39.370> if

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:39.639 
be the right choice for you though if

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:41.670 
be the right choice for you though if
you<00:04:39.729> like<00:04:39.939> listening<00:04:40.150> to<00:04:40.389> hip<00:04:40.960> hop<00:04:41.169> dance

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
you like listening to hip hop dance

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.610 
you like listening to hip hop dance
house<00:04:42.490> music<00:04:43.090> then<00:04:43.659> that's<00:04:44.080> really<00:04:44.169> where<00:04:44.529> the

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
house music then that's really where the

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.640 
house music then that's really where the
beats<00:04:44.830> pro<00:04:45.099> excel<00:04:45.610> in<00:04:45.840> because<00:04:46.840> of<00:04:47.080> their<00:04:47.319> bass

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
beats pro excel in because of their bass

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.070 
beats pro excel in because of their bass
all<00:04:48.610> in<00:04:48.849> all<00:04:48.969> I<00:04:49.240> really<00:04:49.629> wouldn't<00:04:50.020> recommend

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
all in all I really wouldn't recommend

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.429 
all in all I really wouldn't recommend
the<00:04:50.529> beats<00:04:50.740> Pro<00:04:51.099> to<00:04:51.729> everybody<00:04:52.389> you<00:04:52.930> can't<00:04:53.229> get

the beats Pro to everybody you can't get

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:54.899

better<00:04:53.560> straight<00:04:54.039> audio<00:04:54.400> quality<00:04:54.639> from

00:04:54.899 --> 00:04:54.909 
better straight audio quality from

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:56.969 
better straight audio quality from
headphones<00:04:55.210> that<00:04:55.719> are<00:04:55.779> almost<00:04:56.620> half<00:04:56.800> the

00:04:56.969 --> 00:04:56.979 
headphones that are almost half the

but<00:04:58.120> the<00:04:58.509> beats<00:04:58.750> produce<00:04:59.199> still<00:04:59.439> excel<00:05:00.069> in

00:05:00.179 --> 00:05:00.189 
but the beats produce still excel in
