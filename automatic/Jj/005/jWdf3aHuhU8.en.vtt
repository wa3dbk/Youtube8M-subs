00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
only using three oblivion rings so if

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.070

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.199 
three of those I have three pacifism
what<00:02:48.080> should<00:02:48.410> should<00:02:49.160> really<00:02:49.550> be<00:02:49.700> journey<00:02:50.000> to

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
what should should really be journey to

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:50.770 
what should should really be journey to
nowhere

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
nowhere

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.110 
nowhere
but<00:02:51.440> it's<00:02:51.890> a<00:02:51.980> really<00:02:52.220> stupid<00:02:52.430> reason<00:02:52.910> the

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
but it's a really stupid reason the

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.460 
but it's a really stupid reason the
reason<00:02:53.390> I'm<00:02:53.510> not<00:02:53.540> using<00:02:53.690> journeyed<00:02:54.350> in

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
reason I'm not using journeyed in

reason I'm not using journeyed in
nowheres<00:02:54.830> is<00:02:55.550> simply<00:02:56.060> because<00:02:56.480> I<00:02:56.990> only<00:02:57.110> have

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
nowheres is simply because I only have

that<00:04:31.479> look<00:04:31.870> good<00:04:32.110> but<00:04:32.620> I'm<00:04:32.740> not<00:04:32.770> sure<00:04:32.919> yet<00:04:33.310> like

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:37.290 
these I don't know if they're good yet
but<00:04:36.009> I<00:04:36.220> picked<00:04:36.460> four<00:04:36.729> of<00:04:36.850> them<00:04:37.000> up<00:04:37.150> because

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
but I picked four of them up because

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.740 
but I picked four of them up because
there<00:04:37.479> were<00:04:37.570> 10<00:04:37.750> cents<00:04:38.169> and<00:04:39.060> I'm<00:04:40.060> using<00:04:40.360> one

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
there were 10 cents and I'm using one

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.360 
there were 10 cents and I'm using one
and<00:04:41.020> every<00:04:41.410> time<00:04:41.590> I've<00:04:41.770> drawn<00:04:42.009> it<00:04:42.220> it's

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
and every time I've drawn it it's

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.159 
and every time I've drawn it it's
actually<00:04:42.910> helped<00:04:43.479> quite<00:04:43.660> a<00:04:43.780> bit

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:44.169 
actually helped quite a bit

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:48.330 
actually helped quite a bit
in<00:04:44.229> both<00:04:45.100> offense<00:04:45.639> and<00:04:45.880> defense<00:04:46.229> so<00:04:47.229> I<00:04:47.530> may<00:04:48.310> be

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
in both offense and defense so I may be

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:49.860 
in both offense and defense so I may be
adding<00:04:48.759> like<00:04:48.910> two<00:04:49.150> or<00:04:49.389> three<00:04:49.419> of<00:04:49.750> these

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
adding like two or three of these

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.990 
adding like two or three of these
probably<00:04:50.560> not<00:04:50.680> for<00:04:50.919> cuz<00:04:51.220> I<00:04:51.460> mean<00:04:51.820> you're

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000

probably not for cuz I mean you're
paying<00:04:52.150> three<00:04:52.509> for<00:04:52.720> only<00:04:52.930> two<00:04:53.080> tokens<00:04:53.590> and<00:04:53.830> if

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:53.919 
paying three for only two tokens and if

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:55.350 
paying three for only two tokens and if
you<00:04:54.009> don't<00:04:54.160> have<00:04:54.310> a<00:04:54.340> galvanized<00:04:54.850> route<00:04:55.150> it's

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
you don't have a galvanized route it's

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.180 
you don't have a galvanized route it's
not<00:04:55.539> gonna<00:04:55.690> help<00:04:55.900> as<00:04:56.110> much<00:04:56.289> as<00:04:56.350> it<00:04:56.650> yes<00:04:56.979> you

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
want it to so I might add one more but

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.600 
want it to so I might add one more but
I'm<00:05:00.370> not<00:05:00.520> sure<00:05:00.699> yet<00:05:01.229> shimmer<00:05:02.229> mirror<00:05:02.610> I've

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
I'm not sure yet shimmer mirror I've

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.310 
I'm not sure yet shimmer mirror I've
been<00:05:03.850> testing<00:05:04.240> with<00:05:04.419> that<00:05:04.630> and<00:05:04.960> that's

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.320 
been testing with that and that's

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.260 
been testing with that and that's
actually<00:05:05.710> been<00:05:06.250> going<00:05:06.400> really<00:05:06.669> good<00:05:06.910> so<00:05:07.180> I'll

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
actually been going really good so I'll

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.629 
actually been going really good so I'll
probably<00:05:07.419> add<00:05:07.720> one<00:05:08.020> more<00:05:08.229> of<00:05:08.350> those<00:05:08.610> when<00:05:09.610> I

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:09.639 
probably add one more of those when I

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:11.840 
probably add one more of those when I
take<00:05:10.389> out<00:05:10.570> some<00:05:10.810> other<00:05:10.990> odds<00:05:11.229> and<00:05:11.380> ends

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:11.850 
take out some other odds and ends

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:15.810 
take out some other odds and ends
this<00:05:12.850> guy<00:05:13.830> Genesis<00:05:14.830> chamber<00:05:15.130> hasn't<00:05:15.699> been
