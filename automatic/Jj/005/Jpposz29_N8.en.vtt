00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:08.779
 Hello 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.790
 good morning wedding followers and style 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.379
 my name is pamela gonzález and today 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.250
 I'm going to present my spain collection 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.250
 blood 2013 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:27.779
 this season is here a collection 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.970
 based on sea creatures and treasures 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.520
 marine collection and dresses 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.010
 gala are based on dark colors to 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.530
 clear in which I see the contrast between 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.840
 day and night this dress has a wave 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.120
 more or less relaxed is representing 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.730
 what marine movements are like 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.700
 from the sea at night the main fabric 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.739
 that used here is a reversible linen 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.440
 and what we use here is gauze 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.340
 iridescent that represents again the 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.340
 marine movements 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.340
 Y 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.660
 in contrast the previous dress with 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.510
 this dress here represent more 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:08.720
 that all day is half coral gold 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:11.180
 because it represents the reflection of the sun in 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.680
 the sand and also good with the theme of 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.780
 core student this is one of my dresses 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.030
 favorites of the collection because I think 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.950
 that exploded quite a lot of textures in this 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.200
 case we have a corrugated pancake or a 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.659
 silk gauze a corrugated silk gauze 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.490
 and at the same time a hand knitting that 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.799
 is in cotton embroidered with crystals 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.259
 swarovski yes moyano that are two of my 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:32.479
 favorite textures also the part of 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:34.640
 back of the back is a pretty knot 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.830
 sexy where it shows quite like that 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.030
 the body shape and I think this 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.830
 dress has had quite acceptance 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.030
 for this reason because it adapts to 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.030
 different bodies 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.100
 these two holidays that we have here are 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.030
 more cocktail dresses in truth what 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.830
 good is that you can use them to 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.480
 multiple purposes really all 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.490
 you can go to a marriage with this 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.410
 dress can be a family dinner with 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.080
 these dresses or you can be a party 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:03.150
 I'm using quite the angle instead 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.400
 because I think pretty sexy the 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.860
 transparencies and I try to innovate several 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:11.700
 textures in this case the fabric to metal 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.230
 which is a metal fabric with rhinestones and 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.330
 at the same time the transparencies of 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.850
 silk tulle then in this case a 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.709
 silk organza also that of certain 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.959
 form closes the dress we have the 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:25.170
 draped in these areas here and 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:27.450
 we have angular cuts and in subject of in 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.220
 relationship of the collection this is going 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.320
 quite with marine creatures since 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.580
 we have as a kind of touches of 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.580
 mermaid with corsets 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.810
 I love working with multiple 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.880
 materials more than all the work with 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:46.590
 eyebrows in different ways from joyce and 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:48.870
 of silk house in being mousse crepes and 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.090
 good in question other materials 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:55.380
 work with cottons for tissues 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:03:00.510
 with fabrics in metals and with linux I'm 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:01.980
 working a lot with linens and the 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.410
 I really did not expect that the first one in 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.840
 if he was going to be a son-in-law who is 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.280
 basically I do not know the birthplace of fashion was 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.140
 an opportunity that I had to really 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.210

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.830
