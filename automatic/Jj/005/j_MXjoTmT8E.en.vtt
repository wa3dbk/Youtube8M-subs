unbelievable the combinations of

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.339 
unbelievable the combinations of
components<00:00:26.130> such<00:00:26.640> high<00:00:26.880> speed<00:00:27.210> I<00:00:27.510> don't<00:00:28.289> know

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
components such high speed I don't know

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:29.779 
components such high speed I don't know
how<00:00:28.470> you<00:00:28.500> can<00:00:28.769> explain<00:00:29.099> it<00:00:29.160> with<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.550> law<00:00:29.760> of

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
how you can explain it with the law of

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.940 
how you can explain it with the law of
physics<00:00:30.090> so<00:00:31.279> yeah<00:00:32.279> it's<00:00:32.730> incredible<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:33.950> like

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
physics so yeah it's incredible and like

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.340 
physics so yeah it's incredible and like

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
tomorrow but I do believe we're very

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.440 
tomorrow but I do believe we're very
strong<00:01:19.710> car<00:01:20.130> around<00:01:20.520> here<00:01:20.790> especially<00:01:20.939> and

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
strong car around here especially and

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.300 
strong car around here especially and
should<00:01:22.020> have<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.200> very<00:01:22.470> good<00:01:22.619> race<00:01:22.770> basis<00:01:23.159> but

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
should have a very good race basis but

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.920 
should have a very good race basis but
good<00:01:23.970> Marcus<00:01:24.390> if<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:24.689> were<00:01:24.810> running

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
good Marcus if you were running

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.929 
good Marcus if you were running
different<00:01:25.439> front<00:01:25.950> wings<00:01:26.189> just<00:01:26.400> tell<00:01:26.670> us<00:01:26.700> about

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
different front wings just tell us about

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.789 
different front wings just tell us about
that<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.540> will<00:01:28.080> it<00:01:28.170> be<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.350> same<00:01:28.380> tomorrow

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
that and will it be the same tomorrow

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.980 
that and will it be the same tomorrow
okay<00:01:29.579> though<00:01:29.759> because<00:01:30.000> that<00:01:30.689> my<00:01:30.810> eyes<00:01:30.960> are

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
okay though because that my eyes are

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.590 
okay though because that my eyes are
very<00:01:31.259> first<00:01:33.740> greater<00:01:35.240> weight<00:01:36.240> that<00:01:36.420> quick

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
very first greater weight that quick

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.090 
very first greater weight that quick
where<00:01:36.869> you<00:01:36.960> running<00:01:37.049> different<00:01:37.619> problems

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
where you running different problems

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.330 
where you running different problems
well<00:01:38.939> i<00:01:38.970> think<00:01:39.090> you<00:01:39.420> know<00:01:39.450> it's<00:01:40.020> always

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
well i think you know it's always

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.940 
well i think you know it's always
between<00:01:41.340> drivers<00:01:41.850> or<00:01:42.750> generally<00:01:43.530> you<00:01:43.860> know

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
between drivers or generally you know

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.560 
between drivers or generally you know
human<00:01:44.280> beings<00:01:44.579> they<00:01:44.759> have<00:01:44.909> different<00:01:45.090> tastes

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
human beings they have different tastes
