00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
driving past the military base I found a

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.160 
driving past the military base I found a
mountain<00:01:09.610> that<00:01:09.850> went<00:01:10.180> a<00:01:10.390> little<00:01:10.780> bit<00:01:10.990> higher

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
mountain that went a little bit higher

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.210 
mountain that went a little bit higher
than<00:01:11.410> the<00:01:11.530> fence

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
than the fence

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.469 
than the fence
meaning<00:01:12.520> if<00:01:12.610> you<00:01:12.700> jumped<00:01:12.970> from<00:01:13.030> the<00:01:13.150> mountain

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
meaning if you jumped from the mountain

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:14.910 
meaning if you jumped from the mountain
you'll<00:01:13.630> be<00:01:13.690> able<00:01:13.750> to<00:01:13.869> get<00:01:13.960> over<00:01:14.050> the<00:01:14.200> fence<00:01:14.380> so

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
you'll be able to get over the fence so

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.260 
you'll be able to get over the fence so
I<00:01:14.950> went<00:01:15.460> and<00:01:15.550> tried<00:01:15.700> it<00:01:15.990> last<00:01:16.990> time<00:01:18.090> now<00:01:19.090> this

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
I went and tried it last time now this

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.750 
I went and tried it last time now this
is<00:01:19.360> my<00:01:19.479> way<00:01:19.630> of<00:01:19.750> getting<00:01:19.990> in<00:01:20.110> there<00:01:20.760> quiet

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:21.760 
is my way of getting in there quiet

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:27.210 
is my way of getting in there quiet
gently<00:01:24.240> just<00:01:25.240> some<00:01:25.420> advice<00:01:25.540> though<00:01:26.160> go<00:01:27.160> to

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
gently just some advice though go to

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.040 
gently just some advice though go to
exactly<00:01:27.550> the<00:01:27.820> same<00:01:28.000> way<00:01:28.119> as<00:01:28.330> me<00:01:28.600> can<00:01:28.840> you<00:01:28.899> get

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.050 
exactly the same way as me can you get

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:30.270 
exactly the same way as me can you get
forced<00:01:29.380> down<00:01:29.530> as<00:01:29.710> soon<00:01:29.800> as<00:01:29.890> you<00:01:30.009> in<00:01:30.100> at<00:01:30.220> the

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
forced down as soon as you in at the

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.190 
forced down as soon as you in at the
military<00:01:30.670> base<00:01:30.759> it<00:01:31.450> was<00:01:31.540> really<00:01:31.750> hard<00:01:31.930> to<00:01:31.990> get

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
military base it was really hard to get

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:41.690 
military base it was really hard to get
out<00:01:32.350> of<00:01:32.470> there<00:01:32.619> alive

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:52.390 

delicious

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.400 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.190 

so<00:01:52.940> this<00:01:53.090> is<00:01:53.210> the<00:01:53.300> best<00:01:53.510> way<00:01:53.630> of<00:01:53.660> doing<00:01:53.870> it<00:01:54.050> go

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
so this is the best way of doing it go

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.680 
so this is the best way of doing it go
