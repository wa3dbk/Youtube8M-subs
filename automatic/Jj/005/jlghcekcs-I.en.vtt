today we're going to be talking about

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.580 
today we're going to be talking about
how<00:00:32.730> you<00:00:32.790> can<00:00:33.060> use<00:00:33.210> time<00:00:33.450> signatures<00:00:33.989> or<00:00:34.230> meter

how you can use time signatures or meter
in<00:00:35.550> order<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:35.880> create<00:00:36.030> tension<00:00:36.450> in<00:00:36.570> your

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
in order to create tension in your

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.960 
in order to create tension in your
songwriting<00:00:37.140> there<00:00:38.010> are<00:00:38.130> obviously<00:00:38.490> a<00:00:38.610> ton<00:00:38.940> of

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:38.970 
songwriting there are obviously a ton of

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.120 
songwriting there are obviously a ton of
ways<00:00:39.240> you<00:00:39.270> can<00:00:39.540> create<00:00:39.750> tension<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.980> most

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:41.130 
ways you can create tension the most

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.770 
ways you can create tension the most
obvious<00:00:41.370> probably<00:00:42.030> would<00:00:42.180> be<00:00:42.300> something<00:00:42.540> like

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
obvious probably would be something like

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.260 
obvious probably would be something like
dissonance<00:00:43.320> where<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.520> notes<00:00:44.670> are<00:00:44.790> clashing

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
dissonance where the notes are clashing

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.610 
dissonance where the notes are clashing
a<00:00:45.330> little<00:00:45.540> bit<00:00:45.630> more<00:00:45.810> and<00:00:45.870> it<00:00:46.140> makes<00:00:46.350> things

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
a little bit more and it makes things

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.040 
a little bit more and it makes things
feel<00:00:46.830> a<00:00:46.890> little<00:00:47.070> bit<00:00:47.190> more<00:00:47.340> tense<00:00:48.050> however

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
feel a little bit more tense however

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.540 
feel a little bit more tense however
today<00:00:49.140> we're<00:00:49.500> talking<00:00:49.650> specifically<00:00:50.400> about

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
today we're talking specifically about

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.230 
today we're talking specifically about
meter<00:00:51.240> and<00:00:51.540> how<00:00:52.080> it<00:00:52.260> can<00:00:52.380> be<00:00:52.500> used<00:00:52.730> in<00:00:53.730> order<00:00:54.120> to

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:54.240 
meter and how it can be used in order to

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
meter and how it can be used in order to
create<00:00:55.430> attention<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.670> will<00:00:57.180> then<00:00:57.420> finally

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
create attention and will then finally

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.650 
create attention and will then finally
the<00:00:58.410> release

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.329 

this<00:01:03.660> example<00:01:04.019> is<00:01:04.199> an<00:01:04.320> 11-8<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.040> it<00:01:05.190> has<00:01:05.309> a

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
this example is an 11-8 and it has a

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.850 
this example is an 11-8 and it has a
very<00:01:05.519> cool<00:01:05.790> sound<00:01:06.060> because<00:01:06.479> overall<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.620> song

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
very cool sound because overall the song

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.460 
very cool sound because overall the song
example<00:01:08.520> sounds<00:01:08.970> pretty<00:01:09.210> relaxing<00:01:09.810> but<00:01:10.290> since

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
example sounds pretty relaxing but since

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.790 
example sounds pretty relaxing but since
our<00:01:10.590> ears<00:01:11.250> are<00:01:11.760> used<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.330> hearing<00:01:12.570> 12-8<00:01:13.140> we

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:13.800 
our ears are used to hearing 12-8 we

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.230 
our ears are used to hearing 12-8 we
feel<00:01:13.979> like<00:01:14.130> we're<00:01:14.310> getting<00:01:14.400> kind<00:01:14.700> of<00:01:14.790> cut<00:01:15.090> off

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
feel like we're getting kind of cut off

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.730 
feel like we're getting kind of cut off
in<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.540> way<00:01:15.690> and<00:01:15.930> it<00:01:16.050> kind<00:01:16.290> of<00:01:16.380> makes<00:01:16.560> this

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
in a way and it kind of makes this

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.200 
in a way and it kind of makes this
tension<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.220> then<00:01:17.310> quick<00:01:17.550> release<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:17.880> it's

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
tension and then quick release and it's

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.690 
tension and then quick release and it's
very<00:01:18.869> quick<00:01:19.260> but<00:01:20.010> while<00:01:20.160> while<00:01:20.550> you're

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
very quick but while while you're

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.550 
very quick but while while you're
listening<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.150> this<00:01:21.300> demonstration<00:01:21.560> pay

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
listening to this demonstration pay

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.680 
listening to this demonstration pay
attention<00:01:22.590> for<00:01:23.130> that<00:01:23.340> because<00:01:24.240> that's<00:01:24.479> the

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 
attention for that because that's the

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.090 
attention for that because that's the
element<00:01:24.930> that<00:01:25.229> you<00:01:25.259> want<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.650> take<00:01:25.800> away<00:01:25.979> from

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
element that you want to take away from

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:55.540 
element that you want to take away from
this<00:01:26.220> example

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.400 

you

00:01:59.400 --> 00:01:59.410 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.020 

this<00:02:00.410> example<00:02:00.770> is<00:02:01.010> in<00:02:01.130> five<00:02:01.340> four<00:02:01.670> and<00:02:01.730> it<00:02:01.940> has

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
this example is in five four and it has

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.390 
this example is in five four and it has
a<00:02:02.060> pretty<00:02:02.270> cool<00:02:02.480> sound<00:02:02.810> because<00:02:03.680> in<00:02:03.890> five<00:02:04.100> four

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 
a pretty cool sound because in five four

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.400 
a pretty cool sound because in five four
it's<00:02:04.670> not<00:02:04.820> like<00:02:04.970> most<00:02:05.180> odd<00:02:05.450> meters<00:02:05.810> if<00:02:06.020> I<00:02:06.140> for

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:06.410 
it's not like most odd meters if I for

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.380 
it's not like most odd meters if I for
you<00:02:06.500> can<00:02:06.650> actually<00:02:06.800> kind<00:02:07.130> of<00:02:07.280> get<00:02:07.520> a<00:02:07.700> groove<00:02:08.090> to

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
you can actually kind of get a groove to

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.180 
you can actually kind of get a groove to
it<00:02:08.420> even<00:02:09.020> though<00:02:09.200> it's<00:02:09.380> not<00:02:09.530> a<00:02:09.560> meter<00:02:09.830> it's<00:02:10.070> not

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
it even though it's not a meter it's not

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.500 
it even though it's not a meter it's not
going<00:02:10.340> to<00:02:10.429> feel<00:02:10.550> so<00:02:10.850> much<00:02:11.000> like<00:02:11.150> your<00:02:11.330> drawing

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
going to feel so much like your drawing

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.810 
going to feel so much like your drawing
back<00:02:11.810> and<00:02:12.050> forth<00:02:12.460> this<00:02:13.460> is<00:02:13.550> a<00:02:13.580> fairly

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
back and forth this is a fairly

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.980 
back and forth this is a fairly
aggressive<00:02:14.420> heavy<00:02:14.690> sounding<00:02:15.440> example<00:02:16.990> where

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
aggressive heavy sounding example where

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.650 
aggressive heavy sounding example where
the<00:02:18.140> focus<00:02:18.350> is<00:02:18.650> on<00:02:18.680> that<00:02:18.890> extra<00:02:19.280> beat<00:02:20.270> that's

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
the focus is on that extra beat that's

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.770 
the focus is on that extra beat that's
added<00:02:21.050> in<00:02:21.140> from<00:02:21.440> 44<00:02:22.160> so<00:02:22.460> we<00:02:23.270> have<00:02:23.480> four

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
added in from 44 so we have four

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.870 
added in from 44 so we have four
sixteenth<00:02:24.260> notes<00:02:24.470> at<00:02:24.620> the<00:02:24.650> end<00:02:24.860> of<00:02:25.010> this<00:02:25.160> that

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
sixteenth notes at the end of this that

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.080 
sixteenth notes at the end of this that
are<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:26.150> real<00:02:26.420> major<00:02:26.840> focus<00:02:27.440> of<00:02:27.790> this<00:02:28.790> meter

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
are the real major focus of this meter

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.490 
are the real major focus of this meter
so<00:02:29.330> pay<00:02:29.480> attention<00:02:29.510> to<00:02:29.930> those<00:02:30.080> while<00:02:30.290> we<00:02:30.380> go

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
so pay attention to those while we go

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:54.410 
so pay attention to those while we go
through<00:02:30.530> this<00:02:30.800> example

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.410 

you

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.819 

all<00:02:59.420> right<00:02:59.540> so<00:02:59.659> this<00:02:59.780> next<00:02:59.840> example<00:03:00.379> is<00:03:00.650> an

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:00.829 
all right so this next example is an

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:03.339 
all right so this next example is an
example<00:03:01.159> from<00:03:01.549> my<00:03:01.879> solo<00:03:02.299> album<00:03:02.599> insomnia<00:03:03.170> and

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:03.349 
example from my solo album insomnia and

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:05.380 
example from my solo album insomnia and
it's<00:03:03.769> from<00:03:03.980> the<00:03:04.099> title<00:03:04.310> track<00:03:04.579> of<00:03:04.909> that<00:03:05.150> album

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
it's from the title track of that album

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.640 
it's from the title track of that album
it's<00:03:06.290> a<00:03:06.439> cool<00:03:07.750> variation<00:03:08.750> of<00:03:08.870> odd<00:03:09.019> meter<00:03:09.290> where

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
it's a cool variation of odd meter where

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.830 
it's a cool variation of odd meter where
we<00:03:09.829> are<00:03:10.069> changing<00:03:10.459> every<00:03:10.760> single<00:03:11.090> measure<00:03:11.299> to

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
we are changing every single measure to

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.530 
we are changing every single measure to
a<00:03:11.870> new<00:03:12.200> time<00:03:12.709> signature<00:03:13.159> so<00:03:13.760> there<00:03:14.000> are<00:03:14.269> four

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
a new time signature so there are four

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.449 
a new time signature so there are four
meters<00:03:15.140> that<00:03:15.290> continually<00:03:15.950> rotate<00:03:16.099> and

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
meters that continually rotate and

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.729 
meters that continually rotate and
that's<00:03:16.579> seven<00:03:16.970> eight<00:03:17.090> three<00:03:17.900> eight<00:03:17.930> seven

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
that's seven eight three eight seven

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:21.220 
that's seven eight three eight seven
eight<00:03:18.859> 48<00:03:19.340> now<00:03:20.120> you<00:03:20.629> want<00:03:20.810> the<00:03:20.870> thing<00:03:20.989> you<00:03:21.079> want

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
eight 48 now you want the thing you want

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.110 
eight 48 now you want the thing you want
to<00:03:21.260> pay<00:03:21.409> attention<00:03:21.530> to<00:03:21.950> it<00:03:22.099> for<00:03:22.670> this<00:03:22.760> is<00:03:22.939> the

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
to pay attention to it for this is the

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.520 
to pay attention to it for this is the
downbeat<00:03:23.629> because<00:03:23.900> if<00:03:23.989> you<00:03:24.109> can<00:03:24.140> hear<00:03:24.470> that

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
downbeat because if you can hear that

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.699 
downbeat because if you can hear that
downbeat<00:03:24.920> in<00:03:25.819> the<00:03:26.090> demonstration<00:03:26.530> you<00:03:27.530> can

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
downbeat in the demonstration you can

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:29.470 
downbeat in the demonstration you can
fill<00:03:28.189> in<00:03:28.340> the<00:03:28.430> gaps<00:03:28.670> from<00:03:28.879> there<00:03:29.060> sometimes

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
fill in the gaps from there sometimes

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.050 
fill in the gaps from there sometimes
when<00:03:29.659> it's<00:03:29.900> moving<00:03:30.109> fairly<00:03:30.409> quickly<00:03:31.060> where

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
when it's moving fairly quickly where

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.220 
when it's moving fairly quickly where

this examples 180 BPM on the click track
if<00:03:36.650> you're<00:03:37.159> listening<00:03:37.400> to<00:03:37.959> that<00:03:38.959> and<00:03:39.230> you're

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:39.349 
if you're listening to that and you're

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:41.289 
if you're listening to that and you're
trying<00:03:39.560> to<00:03:39.709> count<00:03:40.010> everything<00:03:40.340> at<00:03:40.849> once<00:03:41.150> it

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
trying to count everything at once it

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:42.819 
trying to count everything at once it
can<00:03:41.420> be<00:03:41.510> a<00:03:41.540> little<00:03:41.690> confusing<00:03:41.840> if<00:03:42.349> you<00:03:42.500> focus

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:42.829 
can be a little confusing if you focus

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:45.280 
can be a little confusing if you focus
on<00:03:42.889> the<00:03:42.950> downbeats<00:03:43.459> first<00:03:43.849> and<00:03:44.180> then<00:03:44.959> fill<00:03:45.200> in

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
on the downbeats first and then fill in

00:03:45.290 --> 00:04:04.740 
on the downbeats first and then fill in
the<00:03:45.379> space<00:03:45.590> that<00:03:45.709> will<00:03:45.799> make<00:03:45.950> it<00:03:46.069> a<00:03:46.129> lot<00:03:46.250> easier

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.920 

you

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.450 

alright<00:04:10.930> so<00:04:11.050> compared<00:04:11.470> to<00:04:11.530> that<00:04:11.650> last<00:04:11.920> example

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:12.460 
alright so compared to that last example

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:13.650 
alright so compared to that last example
this<00:04:12.580> one's<00:04:12.790> going<00:04:12.910> to<00:04:12.970> approach<00:04:13.300> things<00:04:13.330> a

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
this one's going to approach things a

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.960 
this one's going to approach things a
little<00:04:13.810> differently<00:04:14.230> rather<00:04:15.190> than<00:04:15.460> changing

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
little differently rather than changing

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:17.729 
little differently rather than changing
meter<00:04:16.209> every<00:04:16.510> single<00:04:16.810> measure<00:04:17.019> what<00:04:17.590> we're

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
meter every single measure what we're

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.860 
meter every single measure what we're
going<00:04:17.890> to<00:04:18.070> do<00:04:18.250> is<00:04:18.489> change<00:04:18.820> meter<00:04:19.090> only<00:04:19.570> for

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
going to do is change meter only for

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.320 
going to do is change meter only for
dramatic<00:04:20.350> effect<00:04:20.459> now<00:04:21.459> what<00:04:21.640> that<00:04:21.670> means<00:04:22.030> is

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
dramatic effect now what that means is

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.060 
dramatic effect now what that means is
we're<00:04:22.510> going<00:04:22.600> to<00:04:22.660> have<00:04:22.870> a<00:04:22.900> focus<00:04:23.380> meter<00:04:23.650> so<00:04:23.920> in

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
we're going to have a focus meter so in

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.490 
we're going to have a focus meter so in
this<00:04:24.160> example<00:04:24.310> we're<00:04:24.790> using<00:04:24.970> 68<00:04:25.480> and<00:04:25.690> we<00:04:26.410> have

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
this example we're using 68 and we have

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.670 
this example we're using 68 and we have
six<00:04:26.770> full<00:04:27.070> measures<00:04:27.430> of<00:04:27.640> 68<00:04:28.060> before<00:04:28.720> we<00:04:29.350> change

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
six full measures of 68 before we change

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.590 
six full measures of 68 before we change
and<00:04:30.070> when<00:04:30.310> we<00:04:30.430> do<00:04:30.550> that<00:04:30.730> change<00:04:31.030> we<00:04:31.240> have<00:04:31.420> one

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
and when we do that change we have one

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.180 
and when we do that change we have one
measure<00:04:31.810> of<00:04:31.990> seven<00:04:32.290> eight<00:04:32.410> and<00:04:32.560> one<00:04:32.620> measure

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
measure of seven eight and one measure

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.730 
measure of seven eight and one measure
of<00:04:33.310> 58<00:04:33.760> and<00:04:33.940> what<00:04:34.600> that<00:04:34.750> does<00:04:34.960> is<00:04:35.020> it<00:04:35.230> we<00:04:35.590> have

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
of 58 and what that does is it we have

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.130 
of 58 and what that does is it we have
our<00:04:35.890> 68<00:04:36.250> which<00:04:36.430> is<00:04:36.610> a<00:04:36.640> very<00:04:37.060> relaxing<00:04:37.750> sounding

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:38.140 
our 68 which is a very relaxing sounding

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.440 
our 68 which is a very relaxing sounding
time<00:04:38.320> signature<00:04:38.740> overall<00:04:39.130> we<00:04:39.610> have<00:04:39.700> 68<00:04:40.090> going

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.450 
time signature overall we have 68 going

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.510 
time signature overall we have 68 going
going<00:04:40.780> going<00:04:40.960> things<00:04:41.470> tense<00:04:41.740> up<00:04:42.010> when<00:04:42.310> we<00:04:42.400> get

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
going going things tense up when we get

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.730 
going going things tense up when we get
to<00:04:42.640> that<00:04:42.730> 78<00:04:43.150> and<00:04:43.270> 58<00:04:43.660> and<00:04:43.810> they<00:04:44.260> release<00:04:44.530> again

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
to that 78 and 58 and they release again

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.470 
to that 78 and 58 and they release again
back<00:04:44.980> to<00:04:45.010> 68<00:04:45.490> and<00:04:45.640> then<00:04:45.730> it<00:04:45.820> keeps<00:04:45.940> on<00:04:46.120> going

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:46.480 
back to 68 and then it keeps on going

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.270 
back to 68 and then it keeps on going
and<00:04:47.140> then<00:04:47.260> what<00:04:47.440> that<00:04:47.560> does<00:04:47.800> is<00:04:47.830> it<00:04:48.130> allows

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
and then what that does is it allows

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.690 
and then what that does is it allows
your<00:04:48.850> chord<00:04:49.120> progression<00:04:49.630> to<00:04:50.320> have<00:04:50.890> this<00:04:51.160> cool

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:51.700 
your chord progression to have this cool

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.880 
your chord progression to have this cool
sort<00:04:52.240> of<00:04:52.330> pull<00:04:52.660> at<00:04:52.990> the<00:04:53.170> end<00:04:53.290> of<00:04:53.440> it<00:04:53.530> to<00:04:53.680> keep

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:53.890 
sort of pull at the end of it to keep

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.340 
sort of pull at the end of it to keep
things<00:04:54.130> driving<00:04:54.730> so<00:04:55.690> try<00:04:55.870> doing<00:04:56.050> this<00:04:56.200> with

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.350 
things driving so try doing this with

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.740 
things driving so try doing this with
your<00:04:56.440> own<00:04:56.560> stuff<00:04:56.830> you<00:04:57.010> know<00:04:57.130> take<00:04:57.450> maybe<00:04:58.450> six

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
your own stuff you know take maybe six

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:59.850 
your own stuff you know take maybe six
eight<00:04:58.870> and<00:04:58.930> seven<00:04:59.230> eight<00:04:59.440> and<00:04:59.530> five<00:04:59.680> eight

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
eight and seven eight and five eight

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.350 
eight and seven eight and five eight
just<00:05:00.040> like<00:05:00.160> this<00:05:00.340> example<00:05:00.669> but<00:05:00.940> put<00:05:01.120> your<00:05:01.240> own

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
just like this example but put your own

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.810 
just like this example but put your own
chords<00:05:01.720> to<00:05:01.930> it<00:05:02.080> to<00:05:02.740> practice<00:05:03.100> the<00:05:03.190> application

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
chords to it to practice the application

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.880 
chords to it to practice the application
for<00:05:04.060> it<00:05:04.150> or<00:05:04.300> take<00:05:05.260> some<00:05:05.470> other<00:05:05.620> time

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:05.890 
for it or take some other time

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:07.860 
for it or take some other time
signatures<00:05:06.340> but<00:05:06.550> the<00:05:06.700> main<00:05:07.150> concept<00:05:07.600> for<00:05:07.750> this

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
signatures but the main concept for this

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.720 
signatures but the main concept for this
is<00:05:08.140> it's<00:05:08.410> only<00:05:08.680> used<00:05:09.010> for<00:05:09.190> the<00:05:09.310> dramatic

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:09.730 
is it's only used for the dramatic

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:11.909 
is it's only used for the dramatic
effect<00:05:10.060> you<00:05:10.690> have<00:05:10.870> your<00:05:11.050> focus<00:05:11.380> meter<00:05:11.650> and

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919 
effect you have your focus meter and

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:15.030 
effect you have your focus meter and
then<00:05:12.460> you<00:05:12.580> have<00:05:12.790> one<00:05:13.270> or<00:05:13.419> two<00:05:13.630> or<00:05:13.930> so<00:05:14.169> at<00:05:14.410> the

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:15.040 
then you have one or two or so at the

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.700 
then you have one or two or so at the
end<00:05:15.070> of<00:05:15.460> your<00:05:15.850> chord<00:05:16.330> progression<00:05:16.840> to<00:05:17.440> really

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
end of your chord progression to really

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.380 
end of your chord progression to really
pull<00:05:17.950> things<00:05:18.160> back<00:05:18.310> around<00:05:18.790> and<00:05:18.940> make<00:05:19.120> this

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:19.390 
pull things back around and make this

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:59.930 
pull things back around and make this
tension<00:05:19.660> and<00:05:19.930> release

00:05:59.930 --> 00:05:59.940 

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:04.220 

you

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:04.230 

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:06.000 

alright<00:06:05.230> so<00:06:05.350> now<00:06:05.470> we're<00:06:05.590> going<00:06:05.710> to<00:06:05.770> be<00:06:05.860> talking

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:06.010 
alright so now we're going to be talking

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:07.470 
alright so now we're going to be talking
about<00:06:06.190> a<00:06:06.340> concept<00:06:06.730> that<00:06:06.880> I<00:06:06.940> refer<00:06:07.300> to<00:06:07.330> as

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:07.480 
about a concept that I refer to as

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.530 
about a concept that I refer to as
doubling<00:06:08.050> doubling<00:06:08.800> is<00:06:09.280> when<00:06:09.640> you<00:06:10.000> have<00:06:10.240> one

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:10.540 
doubling doubling is when you have one

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:12.960 
doubling doubling is when you have one
meter<00:06:10.780> and<00:06:11.080> then<00:06:11.740> then<00:06:11.980> that<00:06:12.130> very<00:06:12.370> next<00:06:12.580> meter

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:12.970 
meter and then then that very next meter

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:15.750 
meter and then then that very next meter
you<00:06:13.180> have<00:06:13.450> is<00:06:13.720> doubled<00:06:14.680> so<00:06:14.980> for<00:06:15.160> example<00:06:15.250> in

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:15.760 
you have is doubled so for example in

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.550 
you have is doubled so for example in
this<00:06:15.880> case<00:06:16.120> we're<00:06:16.330> using<00:06:16.360> 58<00:06:17.050> and<00:06:17.230> then<00:06:17.440> the

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:17.560 
this case we're using 58 and then the

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.460 
this case we're using 58 and then the
next<00:06:17.710> measure<00:06:18.010> is<00:06:18.250> 54<00:06:18.930> there's<00:06:19.930> twice<00:06:20.110> as<00:06:20.170> many

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:20.470 
next measure is 54 there's twice as many

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:22.860 
next measure is 54 there's twice as many
eighth<00:06:21.130> notes<00:06:21.520> in<00:06:21.700> the<00:06:21.790> or<00:06:22.180> whatever<00:06:22.510> you<00:06:22.660> want

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:22.870 
eighth notes in the or whatever you want

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.050 
eighth notes in the or whatever you want
to<00:06:22.930> break<00:06:23.200> it<00:06:23.230> down<00:06:23.410> to<00:06:23.680> now<00:06:24.430> the<00:06:24.490> cool<00:06:25.030> thing

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:25.060 
to break it down to now the cool thing

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.840 
to break it down to now the cool thing
about<00:06:25.270> this<00:06:25.720> is<00:06:25.990> you<00:06:26.350> have<00:06:26.710> this<00:06:26.890> really<00:06:27.490> tight

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:27.850 
about this is you have this really tight

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:29.970 
about this is you have this really tight
sounding<00:06:28.480> shorter<00:06:29.050> measure<00:06:29.260> and<00:06:29.560> then

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:29.980 
sounding shorter measure and then

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:31.530 
sounding shorter measure and then
there's<00:06:30.190> more<00:06:30.370> this<00:06:30.730> release<00:06:31.120> into<00:06:31.510> the

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:31.540 
there's more this release into the

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:33.000 
there's more this release into the
longer<00:06:31.990> one<00:06:32.110> then<00:06:32.290> it's<00:06:32.440> back<00:06:32.560> to<00:06:32.620> tighten

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:33.010 
longer one then it's back to tighten

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:34.230 
longer one then it's back to tighten
releasing<00:06:33.370> its<00:06:33.460> kind<00:06:33.610> of<00:06:33.670> this<00:06:33.760> constant

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:34.240 
releasing its kind of this constant

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.200 
releasing its kind of this constant
switch<00:06:34.540> back<00:06:35.020> and<00:06:35.050> forth<00:06:35.290> it's<00:06:35.920> very<00:06:36.040> cool<00:06:36.340> now

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:37.210 
switch back and forth it's very cool now

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:39.420 
switch back and forth it's very cool now
while<00:06:37.870> this<00:06:37.990> example<00:06:38.290> only<00:06:38.500> used<00:06:38.740> talks<00:06:39.250> about

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:39.430 
while this example only used talks about

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:42.600 
while this example only used talks about
doubling<00:06:39.910> you<00:06:40.600> can<00:06:40.810> also<00:06:41.020> use<00:06:41.460> concept<00:06:42.460> that<00:06:42.520> I

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:42.610 
doubling you can also use concept that I

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.520 
doubling you can also use concept that I
refer<00:06:42.820> to<00:06:42.880> as<00:06:43.000> having<00:06:43.630> which<00:06:43.960> is<00:06:44.140> basically

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:44.530 
refer to as having which is basically

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:46.440 
refer to as having which is basically
opposite<00:06:45.040> so<00:06:45.280> that<00:06:45.820> would<00:06:45.940> be<00:06:45.970> the<00:06:46.210> equivalent

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:46.450 
opposite so that would be the equivalent

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:48.900 
opposite so that would be the equivalent
of<00:06:46.810> playing<00:06:47.170> you<00:06:47.770> know<00:06:47.860> something<00:06:48.160> like<00:06:48.190> 74

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:48.910 
of playing you know something like 74

00:06:48.910 --> 00:07:16.390 
of playing you know something like 74
and<00:06:49.090> then<00:06:49.330> seven<00:06:49.690> eight

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:16.400 

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.460 

you
