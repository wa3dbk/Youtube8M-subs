dead is on screen there but that does

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.069 
dead is on screen there but that does
not<00:00:33.940> have<00:00:34.180> anything<00:00:34.360> to<00:00:34.539> do<00:00:34.629> with<00:00:34.719> zombies

00:00:35.069 --> 00:00:35.079

not have anything to do with zombies
that<00:00:35.230> we<00:00:35.350> know<00:00:35.620> of<00:00:35.969> but<00:00:36.969> the<00:00:37.660> focus<00:00:38.559> of<00:00:38.920> this

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
that we know of but the focus of this

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.010 
that we know of but the focus of this
video<00:00:39.280> is<00:00:39.640> actually<00:00:39.820> going<00:00:40.239> to<00:00:40.329> be<00:00:40.450> on<00:00:40.780> and

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.020

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:01.540 
but what the death machine drop is gonna

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.030 
but what the death machine drop is gonna
look<00:01:01.719> like<00:01:01.780> we've<00:01:02.170> seen<00:01:02.200> the<00:01:02.440> death<00:01:02.800> machine

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.040 
look like we've seen the death machine

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.630 
look like we've seen the death machine
in<00:01:03.839> the<00:01:04.839> multiplayer<00:01:05.530> reveal<00:01:05.740> looked<00:01:06.369> at<00:01:06.460> this

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 
in the multiplayer reveal looked at this

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.429 
in the multiplayer reveal looked at this
it's<00:01:06.850> basically<00:01:07.390> an<00:01:07.570> extension<00:01:07.810> to<00:01:08.289> your

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:08.439 
it's basically an extension to your

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:10.319 
it's basically an extension to your
freaking<00:01:08.770> hand<00:01:09.009> I<00:01:09.219> think<00:01:09.250> I<00:01:09.729> think<00:01:10.119> it's<00:01:10.240> a

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:10.329 
freaking hand I think I think it's a

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:12.330 
freaking hand I think I think it's a
specialist<00:01:10.810> that<00:01:11.020> one<00:01:11.590> of<00:01:11.680> the<00:01:11.740> specialists

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
specialist that one of the specialists

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.210 
specialist that one of the specialists
it's<00:01:13.270> basically<00:01:14.080> a<00:01:14.200> gattling<00:01:14.650> gun<00:01:14.680> basically

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
it's basically a gattling gun basically

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.260 
it's basically a gattling gun basically
a<00:01:15.610> death<00:01:15.880> machine<00:01:16.060> and<00:01:16.450> it<00:01:16.630> looks<00:01:16.960> sick<00:01:17.920> as

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
a death machine and it looks sick as

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.020 
a death machine and it looks sick as
hell<00:01:19.270> like<00:01:19.780> I<00:01:19.930> am<00:01:20.290> just<00:01:20.920> looking<00:01:21.130> at<00:01:21.430> that<00:01:21.460> that

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
hell like I am just looking at that that

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.120 
hell like I am just looking at that that
makes<00:01:22.270> me<00:01:22.450> want<00:01:22.659> to<00:01:22.750> just<00:01:22.900> bust<00:01:23.470> that<00:01:23.710> out<00:01:23.770> and

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
makes me want to just bust that out and

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.190 
makes me want to just bust that out and
start<00:01:24.729> laying<00:01:25.240> down<00:01:25.450> zombies<00:01:25.689> and<00:01:25.960> this<00:01:26.049> would

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
start laying down zombies and this would

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.330 
start laying down zombies and this would
make<00:01:26.290> total<00:01:26.560> sense<00:01:26.590> you<00:01:26.830> know<00:01:26.860> you<00:01:27.040> get<00:01:27.220> the

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
make total sense you know you get the

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.490 
make total sense you know you get the
death<00:01:27.520> machine<00:01:27.670> drop<00:01:28.119> in<00:01:28.270> zombies<00:01:29.170> and<00:01:29.409> then

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
death machine drop in zombies and then

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.960 
death machine drop in zombies and then
all<00:01:29.710> of<00:01:29.740> a<00:01:29.830> sudden<00:01:30.100> out<00:01:30.220> of<00:01:30.280> your<00:01:30.460> arm<00:01:30.640> comes

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
all of a sudden out of your arm comes

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.840 
all of a sudden out of your arm comes
maybe<00:01:31.270> dual<00:01:31.750> wield<00:01:32.229> death<00:01:32.500> machines<00:01:32.979> how<00:01:33.220> dope

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
maybe dual wield death machines how dope

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.450 
maybe dual wield death machines how dope
would<00:01:33.880> that<00:01:34.360> be<00:01:34.600> like<00:01:35.130> wouldn't<00:01:36.130> that<00:01:36.189> just<00:01:36.250> be

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
would that be like wouldn't that just be

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.160 
would that be like wouldn't that just be
sick<00:01:36.759> I<00:01:36.909> hope<00:01:37.240> that<00:01:37.450> I<00:01:37.630> think<00:01:37.869> that<00:01:37.990> would<00:01:38.049> be

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
sick I hope that I think that would be

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.469 
sick I hope that I think that would be
really<00:01:38.350> really<00:01:39.040> cool<00:01:39.430> so<00:01:39.939> that's<00:01:40.180> probably

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
really really cool so that's probably

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:42.149 
really really cool so that's probably
what<00:01:40.720> the<00:01:40.780> death<00:01:40.930> machine<00:01:41.080> if<00:01:41.470> I<00:01:41.830> might

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 
what the death machine if I might

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:43.320 
what the death machine if I might
imagine<00:01:42.369> it's<00:01:42.700> returning<00:01:43.090> if<00:01:43.180> they're

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330 
imagine it's returning if they're

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:44.399 
imagine it's returning if they're
especially<00:01:43.600> if<00:01:43.840> they're<00:01:43.960> putting<00:01:44.200> it<00:01:44.290> in

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
especially if they're putting it in

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:45.870 
especially if they're putting it in
multiplayer<00:01:44.799> I<00:01:44.890> imagine<00:01:45.549> they're<00:01:45.670> going<00:01:45.820> to

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
multiplayer I imagine they're going to

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.210 
multiplayer I imagine they're going to
keep<00:01:46.030> it<00:01:46.150> and<00:01:46.360> leave<00:01:46.570> it<00:01:46.600> in<00:01:46.780> zombies<00:01:47.409> I<00:01:47.650> mean

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
keep it and leave it in zombies I mean

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.710 
keep it and leave it in zombies I mean
just<00:01:48.250> cuz<00:01:48.549> it's<00:01:48.729> a<00:01:48.850> pretty<00:01:49.090> cool<00:01:49.240> drop<00:01:49.509> and

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
just cuz it's a pretty cool drop and

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:50.940 
just cuz it's a pretty cool drop and
that<00:01:49.840> actually<00:01:50.110> would<00:01:50.380> making<00:01:50.650> a<00:01:50.710> lot<00:01:50.829> more

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
that actually would making a lot more

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.380 
that actually would making a lot more
fun<00:01:51.130> if<00:01:51.310> it<00:01:51.400> comes<00:01:51.610> out<00:01:51.700> of<00:01:51.820> your<00:01:51.909> hand<00:01:52.150> as

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
fun if it comes out of your hand as

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:53.910 
fun if it comes out of your hand as
opposed<00:01:52.689> to<00:01:52.810> just<00:01:52.869> whipping<00:01:53.290> it<00:01:53.530> out<00:01:53.619> from

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
opposed to just whipping it out from

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.440 
opposed to just whipping it out from
nowhere<00:01:54.189> just<00:01:54.640> pulling<00:01:54.970> it<00:01:55.060> out<00:01:55.150> of<00:01:55.210> your

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
nowhere just pulling it out of your

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:56.760 
nowhere just pulling it out of your
pants<00:01:55.810> because<00:01:55.930> you<00:01:56.170> just<00:01:56.350> have<00:01:56.500> a<00:01:56.530> lot<00:01:56.740> of

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
pants because you just have a lot of

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.050 
pants because you just have a lot of
room<00:01:57.040> in<00:01:57.130> your<00:01:57.250> pants<00:01:57.610> you<00:01:57.670> know<00:01:57.820> when<00:01:57.970> I'm
