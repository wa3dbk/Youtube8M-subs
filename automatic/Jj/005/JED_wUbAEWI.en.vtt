00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:06.700
 Hi, first, send us many greetings and 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.980
 with the novelty that today we will learn to 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:12.480
 make this gift bag let's see 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.480
 the materials that we will need 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:21.439
 first of all a pencil or marker 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:26.369
 to mark glue on bar an exact 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:28.349
 a double mark cesc our rule some 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.349
 sticker or button to decorate our 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.090
 bag and what we are going to give also 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.790
 we will need our cardboard or 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.770
 resistant material for our bag 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:42.440
 we start with a square of 30 x 30 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.930
 centimeters to every 10 centimeters of 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.989
 side of the square we will mark by the 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:50.000
 four sides taking these points as 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:52.310
 reference let's grab our 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.559
 square and we fold it in three parts 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:57.820
 then we will turn it over and repeat 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:57.820
 that same step 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.270
 since we have so our square 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.940
 let's grab our rule and exact and 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.970
 we will remove these corners by the four 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.970
 sides 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:36.170
 right away we will make the next fold 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.790
 carrying these two corners together there 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.520
 what do we do now that we fold 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:43.580
 this starting from this point that 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.070
 we have here down to the top now 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:49.510
 we mark well and we repeat this step 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.510
 the other three that we are missing 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.209
 we take our rule and we are going to do 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:14.410
 a mark up and down at 5 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:17.260
 centimeters later we're going to flip the and 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.270
 we are going to mark a line at 5 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.120
 centimeters in this case I 'm going to 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.530
 mark with my marker but I had 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.440
 preference I walk with pencil so that 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:30.280
 then you can erase it after we go to 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:35.010
 do this line and we take it to the 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.010
 center the same thing we do from the other side 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.190
 then with the help of our brand 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.440
 double or some pen that does not have ink 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.840
 let's mark the lines that we just 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.950
 doing this is going to facilitate the 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.950
 following folds 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.680
 now you just have to bend a bit towards 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.550
 down the three lines that we just 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.550
 make and mark 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.720
 since we have this, you are going to see 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.730
 how is it that the bag is going to be forming 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.180
 now you just have to do the same thing 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.180
 other side 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.900
 practically at this point our 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:48.740
 gift bag is almost ready there is only 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:51.320
 that put the potraderas good like this 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:54.140
 we're going to call them in this tutorial but 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:56.600
 I do not know what exactly they are called 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:04:00.830
 let's do with two strips of paper 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:03.380
 one centimeter by 14 centimeters we are going to 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.940
 do the next thing that is to bend it towards 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.190
 in 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:10.370
 let's hold it in this part and 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:14.150
 then we double up 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:16.560
 if you like you can mark it or leave it like this 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:19.889
 without having so much 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:22.579
 the doubles brand the height and width 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:22.579
 you define it 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.400
 and to fold the second strips only 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.919
 you guide yourself from the first one you did 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:42.560
 Then you take your glue stick and 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:42.560
 you place it in the place that you prefer 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:03.270
 well, our bag is ready 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.000
 you can leave it like this so that when 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.980
 gifts open the moment of release or 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.910
 also with the help of some strip of 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:14.940
 paper buttons and stickers like in this 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:18.030
 case or even Velcro can help you with 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:20.990
 that's for the bag to close and so not 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.990
 teach now so much 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:35.780
 and that's how we finished our bag 

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:37.789
 I hope you liked the gift 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.889
 tutorial see you in the next and 

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:41.990
 remember that if you do this bag or 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:44.629
 some other craft you can send me 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:46.400
