really solid left hand technique you
know<00:00:33.230> exactly<00:00:33.559> where<00:00:33.890> your<00:00:34.040> notes<00:00:34.190> are<00:00:34.430> so

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
know exactly where your notes are so

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.940 
know exactly where your notes are so
let's<00:00:34.820> just<00:00:34.969> talk<00:00:35.149> it<00:00:35.329> through<00:00:35.360> real<00:00:36.350> quick<00:00:36.530> so

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:36.950 
let's just talk it through real quick so

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:38.320 
let's just talk it through real quick so
when<00:00:37.070> we're<00:00:37.250> on<00:00:37.309> the<00:00:37.340> g<00:00:37.640> string<00:00:37.670> we're<00:00:38.210> gonna

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:38.330 
when we're on the g string we're gonna

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:39.880 
when we're on the g string we're gonna
play<00:00:38.480> open<00:00:38.810> G<00:00:38.960> and<00:00:39.260> then<00:00:39.410> we<00:00:39.500> have<00:00:39.620> our<00:00:39.740> first

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
play open G and then we have our first

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.680 
play open G and then we have our first
finger<00:00:40.430> and<00:00:40.640> then<00:00:41.030> there's<00:00:41.180> gonna<00:00:41.300> be<00:00:41.510> a<00:00:41.540> big

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
finger and then there's gonna be a big

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.270 
finger and then there's gonna be a big
space<00:00:41.990> between<00:00:42.230> our<00:00:42.590> first<00:00:42.710> and<00:00:42.980> second

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
space between our first and second

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.220 
space between our first and second
finger<00:00:43.520> that's<00:00:43.670> called<00:00:43.940> a<00:00:44.030> whole<00:00:44.210> step<00:00:44.480> and

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
finger that's called a whole step and

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.690 
finger that's called a whole step and
then<00:00:45.380> there's<00:00:45.590> going<00:00:45.770> to<00:00:45.860> be<00:00:45.980> a<00:00:46.100> half<00:00:46.340> step

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:46.700 
then there's going to be a half step

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.500 
then there's going to be a half step
between<00:00:46.880> our<00:00:47.150> second<00:00:47.570> and<00:00:47.660> third<00:00:47.840> finger<00:00:49.510> so

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
between our second and third finger so

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:51.640 
between our second and third finger so
they're<00:00:50.630> right<00:00:50.810> next<00:00:50.960> to<00:00:51.140> each<00:00:51.260> other<00:00:51.440> they're

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:51.650 
they're right next to each other they're

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:52.870 
they're right next to each other they're
gonna<00:00:51.739> be<00:00:51.920> touching<00:00:52.310> and<00:00:52.460> then<00:00:52.520> there's<00:00:52.730> going

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:52.880 
gonna be touching and then there's going

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.430 
gonna be touching and then there's going
to<00:00:52.940> be<00:00:53.030> a<00:00:53.120> whole<00:00:53.360> step<00:00:53.480> to<00:00:54.020> our<00:00:54.140> fourth<00:00:54.350> finger

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
to be a whole step to our fourth finger

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.680 
to be a whole step to our fourth finger
that's<00:00:55.250> another<00:00:55.489> thing<00:00:55.700> we<00:00:56.210> are<00:00:56.360> going<00:00:56.600> to

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
that's another thing we are going to

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.560 
that's another thing we are going to
play<00:00:56.890> no<00:00:57.890> open<00:00:58.220> strings<00:00:58.579> when<00:00:59.000> we<00:00:59.090> play<00:00:59.270> scales

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
play no open strings when we play scales

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.720 
play no open strings when we play scales
except<00:01:00.170> for<00:01:00.440> the<00:01:00.829> g<00:01:00.980> string<00:01:01.280> because<00:01:01.489> we<00:01:01.610> have

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
except for the g string because we have

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.060 
except for the g string because we have
to<00:01:01.850> play<00:01:01.970> that<00:01:02.149> one<00:01:02.270> open<00:01:02.390> and<00:01:03.230> then<00:01:03.770> the<00:01:03.890> rest

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
to play that one open and then the rest

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:05.170 
to play that one open and then the rest
of<00:01:04.189> the<00:01:04.250> notes<00:01:04.430> we're<00:01:04.549> gonna<00:01:04.640> we're<00:01:05.089> gonna

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
of the notes we're gonna we're gonna

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.880 
of the notes we're gonna we're gonna
play<00:01:05.420> our<00:01:05.449> fourth<00:01:05.810> finger<00:01:05.899> instead<00:01:06.380> of<00:01:06.560> open

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
play our fourth finger instead of open

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.830 
play our fourth finger instead of open
strings<00:01:07.310> and<00:01:07.700> the<00:01:08.119> reason<00:01:08.390> for<00:01:08.420> that<00:01:08.600> is

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
strings and the reason for that is

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.020 
strings and the reason for that is
because<00:01:09.200> when<00:01:09.859> you<00:01:09.950> get<00:01:10.069> into<00:01:10.249> harder<00:01:10.639> scales

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
because when you get into harder scales

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.999 
because when you get into harder scales
with<00:01:11.299> a<00:01:11.329> lot<00:01:11.479> of<00:01:11.600> sharps<00:01:11.869> or<00:01:12.049> flats<00:01:12.079> sometimes

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:13.009 
with a lot of sharps or flats sometimes

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:14.649 
with a lot of sharps or flats sometimes
you<00:01:13.159> can't<00:01:13.369> play<00:01:13.579> any<00:01:13.609> open<00:01:14.119> strings<00:01:14.420> you<00:01:14.600> have

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
you can't play any open strings you have

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:16.629 
you can't play any open strings you have
to<00:01:14.869> finger<00:01:15.109> all<00:01:15.229> the<00:01:15.259> notes<00:01:15.560> so<00:01:16.280> it's<00:01:16.429> good<00:01:16.609> to

00:01:16.629 --> 00:01:16.639 
to finger all the notes so it's good to

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:18.789 
to finger all the notes so it's good to
get<00:01:16.819> into<00:01:16.999> that<00:01:17.119> habit<00:01:17.389> and<00:01:17.810> learn<00:01:18.380> the<00:01:18.530> finger

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 
get into that habit and learn the finger

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:20.739 
get into that habit and learn the finger
patterns<00:01:19.280> so<00:01:19.999> that<00:01:20.030> later<00:01:20.299> when<00:01:20.509> you<00:01:20.600> play

00:01:20.739 --> 00:01:20.749 
patterns so that later when you play

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:22.359 
patterns so that later when you play
more<00:01:20.869> difficult<00:01:21.350> scales<00:01:21.679> it<00:01:21.889> won't<00:01:22.069> be<00:01:22.159> hard

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
more difficult scales it won't be hard

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:22.899 
more difficult scales it won't be hard
for<00:01:22.579> you

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
for you

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:24.039 
for you
so<00:01:23.030> we're<00:01:23.149> just<00:01:23.179> gonna<00:01:23.359> start<00:01:23.630> right<00:01:23.780> out<00:01:23.810> with

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
so we're just gonna start right out with

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:26.080 
so we're just gonna start right out with
that<00:01:24.170> so<00:01:24.709> we<00:01:25.130> did<00:01:25.280> the<00:01:25.369> g<00:01:25.520> string<00:01:25.759> pattern

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
that so we did the g string pattern

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.940 
that so we did the g string pattern
looks<00:01:26.299> like<00:01:26.389> this<00:01:26.719> now<00:01:27.229> we're<00:01:27.380> gonna<00:01:27.469> do<00:01:27.649> the<00:01:27.770> D

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
looks like this now we're gonna do the D

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.219 
looks like this now we're gonna do the D
string<00:01:28.219> pattern<00:01:28.700> it<00:01:29.299> looks<00:01:29.479> exactly<00:01:29.689> the<00:01:30.049> same

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
string pattern it looks exactly the same

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:31.539 
string pattern it looks exactly the same
it's<00:01:30.499> gonna<00:01:30.619> be<00:01:30.740> the<00:01:30.829> same<00:01:30.950> exact<00:01:31.310> pattern

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
it's gonna be the same exact pattern

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:33.910 
it's gonna be the same exact pattern
whole<00:01:32.359> step<00:01:32.600> between<00:01:32.810> 1st<00:01:33.200> and<00:01:33.319> 2nd<00:01:33.740> finger

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
whole step between 1st and 2nd finger

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.949 
whole step between 1st and 2nd finger
and<00:01:34.279> then<00:01:34.609> whole<00:01:34.789> step<00:01:35.029> between<00:01:35.179> 3rd<00:01:35.569> and<00:01:35.749> 4th

00:01:35.949 --> 00:01:35.959 
and then whole step between 3rd and 4th

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:37.690 
and then whole step between 3rd and 4th
fingers<00:01:36.409> now<00:01:36.979> when<00:01:37.100> we<00:01:37.189> get<00:01:37.279> on<00:01:37.399> the<00:01:37.429> a<00:01:37.520> string

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
fingers now when we get on the a string

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.029 
fingers now when we get on the a string
that's<00:01:38.240> where<00:01:38.450> things<00:01:38.719> change<00:01:39.109> we're<00:01:39.979> gonna

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:40.039 
that's where things change we're gonna

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:42.010 
that's where things change we're gonna
have<00:01:40.340> our<00:01:40.459> 1st<00:01:40.670> finger<00:01:40.819> and<00:01:41.090> then<00:01:41.539> the<00:01:41.569> half

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
have our 1st finger and then the half

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.719 
have our 1st finger and then the half
step<00:01:42.409> is<00:01:42.560> going<00:01:42.770> to<00:01:42.889> be<00:01:43.039> between<00:01:43.249> our<00:01:43.549> first

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
step is going to be between our first

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:45.669 
step is going to be between our first
and<00:01:43.999> second<00:01:44.389> fingers<00:01:44.779> so<00:01:45.350> they're<00:01:45.439> gonna<00:01:45.560> be

00:01:45.669 --> 00:01:45.679 
and second fingers so they're gonna be

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:47.529 
and second fingers so they're gonna be
close<00:01:45.799> together<00:01:46.039> and<00:01:46.700> the<00:01:46.909> whole<00:01:47.029> step<00:01:47.329> will

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:47.539 
close together and the whole step will

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:50.469 
close together and the whole step will
be<00:01:47.630> between<00:01:47.869> our<00:01:48.139> 2nd<00:01:48.529> and<00:01:48.619> 3rd<00:01:48.829> finger<00:01:49.479> so

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
be between our 2nd and 3rd finger so

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.660 
be between our 2nd and 3rd finger so
it's<00:01:50.630> changed<00:01:50.959> from<00:01:51.109> this<00:01:51.380> it<00:01:52.159> changes<00:01:52.549> to

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
it's changed from this it changes to

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.910 
it's changed from this it changes to
this<00:01:52.880> ok<00:01:53.659> so<00:01:53.689> be<00:01:54.079> aware<00:01:54.200> of<00:01:54.409> that<00:01:54.709> because

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
this ok so be aware of that because

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.129 
this ok so be aware of that because
we're<00:01:55.789> gonna<00:01:55.880> play<00:01:56.060> C<00:01:56.299> natural<00:01:56.810> on<00:01:56.990> the<00:01:57.020> a

00:01:57.129 --> 00:01:57.139 
we're gonna play C natural on the a

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:59.620 
we're gonna play C natural on the a
string<00:01:57.799> which<00:01:58.729> will<00:01:58.849> be<00:01:58.969> right<00:01:59.119> next<00:01:59.270> to<00:01:59.479> our

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
string which will be right next to our

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.769 
string which will be right next to our
first<00:01:59.840> finger<00:02:00.170> which<00:02:00.349> is<00:02:00.380> a<00:02:00.499> B<00:02:00.740> ok<00:02:01.490> so<00:02:02.029> the

00:02:02.769 --> 00:02:02.779 
first finger which is a B ok so the

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:04.629 
first finger which is a B ok so the
whole<00:02:02.929> step<00:02:03.139> will<00:02:03.259> between<00:02:03.499> 2nd<00:02:04.069> 3rd<00:02:04.249> finger

00:02:04.629 --> 00:02:04.639 
whole step will between 2nd 3rd finger

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:06.580 
whole step will between 2nd 3rd finger
and<00:02:04.819> third<00:02:04.999> and<00:02:05.209> fourth<00:02:05.329> finger<00:02:05.749> and<00:02:05.959> this<00:02:06.439> is

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
and third and fourth finger and this is

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:07.929 
and third and fourth finger and this is
going<00:02:06.709> to<00:02:06.799> be<00:02:06.889> the<00:02:06.979> exact<00:02:07.249> same<00:02:07.279> pattern<00:02:07.669> on

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:07.939 
going to be the exact same pattern on

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:10.150 
going to be the exact same pattern on
the<00:02:08.090> e<00:02:08.119> string<00:02:08.270> as<00:02:08.810> well<00:02:09.020> we're<00:02:09.709> going<00:02:09.890> to<00:02:10.009> have

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
the e string as well we're going to have

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.680 
the e string as well we're going to have
the<00:02:10.310> half<00:02:10.490> step<00:02:10.789> between<00:02:11.000> our<00:02:11.240> first<00:02:11.450> and

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
the half step between our first and

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.309 
the half step between our first and
second<00:02:12.050> finger<00:02:12.849> so<00:02:13.849> now<00:02:14.840> let's<00:02:15.110> talk<00:02:15.260> about

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
second finger so now let's talk about

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.350 
second finger so now let's talk about
the<00:02:15.590> notes<00:02:15.799> no

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
the notes no

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.300 
the notes no
scales<00:02:18.290> are<00:02:18.560> a<00:02:18.590> good<00:02:18.740> way<00:02:18.860> to<00:02:18.920> learn<00:02:19.130> how<00:02:19.160> to

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
scales are a good way to learn how to

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.270 
scales are a good way to learn how to
read<00:02:19.550> notes<00:02:19.580> because<00:02:21.070> it's<00:02:22.070> pretty

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
read notes because it's pretty

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.470 
read notes because it's pretty
self-explanatory

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
self-explanatory

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.560 
self-explanatory
you<00:02:23.780> know<00:02:23.870> we<00:02:23.990> have<00:02:24.140> our<00:02:24.470> g<00:02:25.070> string<00:02:25.100> open<00:02:25.580> G<00:02:26.000> and

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
you know we have our g string open G and

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.130 
you know we have our g string open G and
the<00:02:26.690> next<00:02:26.930> note<00:02:27.080> is<00:02:27.230> a<00:02:27.500> and<00:02:28.130> then<00:02:28.400> B<00:02:28.640> then<00:02:29.000> C<00:02:29.450> and

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
the next note is a and then B then C and

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:41.710 
the next note is a and then B then C and
then<00:02:30.500> D<00:02:30.530> e<00:02:31.240> F<00:02:32.240> sharp<00:02:32.720> G<00:02:33.370> a<00:02:36.700> B<00:02:37.700> C<00:02:38.120> natural<00:02:38.750> D<00:02:39.430> e<00:02:40.720> F

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
then D e F sharp G a B C natural D e F

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.510 
then D e F sharp G a B C natural D e F
sharp<00:02:41.780> and<00:02:42.620> then<00:02:42.980> G<00:02:44.709> so<00:02:45.709> that's<00:02:46.100> pretty<00:02:46.459> easy

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
sharp and then G so that's pretty easy

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.290 
sharp and then G so that's pretty easy
to<00:02:46.790> figure<00:02:46.970> out

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
to figure out

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.290 
to figure out
um<00:02:48.130> sometimes<00:02:49.130> people<00:02:49.310> also<00:02:49.640> ask<00:02:49.910> me<00:02:49.970> how<00:02:50.150> do<00:02:50.209> I

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
um sometimes people also ask me how do I

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.100 
um sometimes people also ask me how do I
know<00:02:50.420> that<00:02:51.459> it's<00:02:52.459> in<00:02:52.700> G<00:02:52.910> major<00:02:53.060> like<00:02:53.510> how<00:02:53.959> do<00:02:54.020> I

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
know that it's in G major like how do I

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.870 
know that it's in G major like how do I
know<00:02:54.170> the<00:02:54.350> etude<00:02:54.770> that<00:02:54.950> we<00:02:55.070> played<00:02:55.280> is<00:02:55.520> in<00:02:55.700> G

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
know the etude that we played is in G

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.540 
know the etude that we played is in G
major<00:02:56.110> that<00:02:57.110> just<00:02:57.470> takes<00:02:57.709> practice<00:02:58.040> of

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
major that just takes practice of

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.490 
major that just takes practice of
learning<00:02:58.700> your<00:02:59.360> key<00:02:59.540> signatures<00:03:00.110> you<00:03:00.230> have<00:03:00.380> to

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
learning your key signatures you have to

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.590 
learning your key signatures you have to
memorize<00:03:00.920> what<00:03:01.160> they<00:03:01.280> look<00:03:01.489> like<00:03:01.520> and<00:03:01.970> in<00:03:02.420> G

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
memorize what they look like and in G

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.449 
memorize what they look like and in G
major<00:03:02.750> we<00:03:03.050> have<00:03:03.080> one<00:03:03.500> sharp<00:03:03.830> which<00:03:04.130> is<00:03:04.250> f<00:03:04.430> sharp

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
major we have one sharp which is f sharp

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.930 
major we have one sharp which is f sharp
so<00:03:05.150> if<00:03:05.450> you<00:03:05.840> see<00:03:06.020> a<00:03:06.050> piece<00:03:06.290> of<00:03:06.440> music<00:03:06.590> with<00:03:07.520> one

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
so if you see a piece of music with one

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.770 
so if you see a piece of music with one
sharp<00:03:08.750> and<00:03:09.489> an<00:03:10.489> F<00:03:10.730> sharp<00:03:10.760> then<00:03:11.300> you<00:03:11.420> know<00:03:11.570> that

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
sharp and an F sharp then you know that

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.530 
sharp and an F sharp then you know that
it's<00:03:11.900> probably<00:03:12.080> in<00:03:12.410> G<00:03:12.560> major

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
it's probably in G major

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.750 
it's probably in G major
it<00:03:14.540> can<00:03:14.690> also<00:03:14.840> be<00:03:15.170> an<00:03:15.410> E<00:03:15.980> minor<00:03:16.250> but<00:03:16.670> we're

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
it can also be an E minor but we're

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.940 
it can also be an E minor but we're
going<00:03:16.880> to<00:03:16.940> talk<00:03:17.090> about<00:03:17.180> that<00:03:17.450> in<00:03:17.810> a<00:03:18.739> few

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
going to talk about that in a few

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.610 
going to talk about that in a few
minutes<00:03:19.190> so<00:03:19.520> most<00:03:20.060> most<00:03:20.630> times<00:03:20.840> it's<00:03:21.140> it's

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
minutes so most most times it's it's

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.940 
minutes so most most times it's it's
going<00:03:21.769> to<00:03:21.890> be<00:03:22.040> either<00:03:22.310> G<00:03:22.489> major<00:03:22.700> or<00:03:23.030> a<00:03:23.330> minor<00:03:23.950> so

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
going to be either G major or a minor so

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.670 
going to be either G major or a minor so
let's<00:03:25.160> play<00:03:25.400> through<00:03:25.610> this<00:03:25.790> scale<00:03:26.680> beginners

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
let's play through this scale beginners

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.050 
let's play through this scale beginners
I'm<00:03:28.010> probably<00:03:28.310> going<00:03:28.549> to<00:03:28.670> give<00:03:28.910> you

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
I'm probably going to give you

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.580 
I'm probably going to give you
assignments<00:03:29.600> where<00:03:30.019> you<00:03:30.110> play<00:03:30.290> through<00:03:30.560> it

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
assignments where you play through it

so what thirds ours you're just doing a

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.800 
so what thirds ours you're just doing a
finger<00:05:59.460> pad<00:05:59.670> and<00:05:59.880> you're<00:05:59.970> going<00:06:00.210> from<00:06:00.390> first

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:10.160 
finger to first finger so it's just that
pattern<00:06:08.550> it<00:06:08.730> goes<00:06:08.850> over<00:06:09.210> and<00:06:09.330> over<00:06:09.510> again<00:06:09.600> and

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:10.170 
pattern it goes over and over again and

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:11.660 
pattern it goes over and over again and
you<00:06:10.290> get<00:06:10.440> some<00:06:10.650> string<00:06:10.980> crossing<00:06:11.490> while

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:11.670 
you get some string crossing while

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:13.340 
you get some string crossing while
you're<00:06:11.820> doing<00:06:12.090> it<00:06:12.210> just<00:06:12.420> a<00:06:12.960> really<00:06:13.170> good<00:06:13.290> thing

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:13.350 
you're doing it just a really good thing

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:16.250 
you're doing it just a really good thing
to<00:06:13.650> practice<00:06:14.000> so<00:06:15.000> let's<00:06:15.270> go<00:06:15.930> through<00:06:16.140> our

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:16.260 
to practice so let's go through our

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.800 
to practice so let's go through our
thirds<00:06:16.500> together<00:06:17.030> using<00:06:18.030> the<00:06:18.180> same<00:06:18.360> bowing<00:06:18.720> as

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:18.810 
thirds together using the same bowing as

00:06:18.810 --> 00:07:17.290 
thirds together using the same bowing as
we<00:06:18.960> did<00:06:19.080> when<00:06:19.260> we<00:06:19.350> play<00:06:19.530> the<00:06:19.680> scale<00:06:19.920> ready

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:17.300 

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.820 

okay<00:07:18.300> so<00:07:18.360> I<00:07:18.600> forgot<00:07:18.930> to<00:07:19.230> mention<00:07:19.380> make<00:07:19.680> sure

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:19.830 
okay so I forgot to mention make sure

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:21.230 
okay so I forgot to mention make sure
you<00:07:19.920> use<00:07:20.070> your<00:07:20.220> fourth<00:07:20.460> finger<00:07:20.520> in<00:07:20.880> the<00:07:20.970> thirds

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:21.240 
you use your fourth finger in the thirds

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:24.680 
you use your fourth finger in the thirds
as<00:07:21.450> well<00:07:21.750> and<00:07:22.970> that'll<00:07:23.970> be<00:07:24.060> a<00:07:24.090> little<00:07:24.360> bit<00:07:24.540> more

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:24.690 
as well and that'll be a little bit more

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:26.060 
as well and that'll be a little bit more
difficult<00:07:25.200> because<00:07:25.290> you're<00:07:25.560> doing<00:07:25.680> string

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:26.070 
difficult because you're doing string

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:28.280 
difficult because you're doing string
crossing<00:07:26.490> but<00:07:26.910> that's<00:07:27.060> a<00:07:27.150> good<00:07:27.240> thing<00:07:27.450> to

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:28.290 
crossing but that's a good thing to

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:30.830 
crossing but that's a good thing to
practice
