00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
blended green lipped mussel

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.280 
blended green lipped mussel
just<00:01:49.470> so<00:01:49.560> it's<00:01:49.860> blended<00:01:50.250> down<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.579> a<00:01:50.610> liquid

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
just so it's blended down to a liquid

added<00:01:52.290> some<00:01:52.530> enzymes<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:53.310> help<00:01:53.520> pre<00:01:53.909> digest<00:01:54.299> it

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
added some enzymes to help pre digest it

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.770 
added some enzymes to help pre digest it
and<00:01:55.520> then<00:01:56.520> it's<00:01:56.700> pasteurized<00:01:57.299> just<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.659> give
