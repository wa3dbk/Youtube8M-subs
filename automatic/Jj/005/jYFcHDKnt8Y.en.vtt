don't<00:03:28.870> know<00:03:29.110> if<00:03:29.140> this<00:03:29.380> thing<00:03:29.530> has<00:03:29.650> the<00:03:29.770> mega

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
don't know if this thing has the mega

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.440 
don't know if this thing has the mega
evolution<00:03:30.430> or<00:03:30.520> not<00:03:30.670> but<00:03:30.880> I'm<00:03:30.940> going<00:03:31.000> to<00:03:31.150> chance

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
evolution or not but I'm going to chance

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:32.670 
evolution or not but I'm going to chance
it<00:03:31.570> because<00:03:31.780> I<00:03:31.900> knew<00:03:32.140> he<00:03:32.320> was<00:03:32.380> thinking<00:03:32.650> about

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
it because I knew he was thinking about

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.380 
it because I knew he was thinking about
going<00:03:32.890> for<00:03:33.100> sucker<00:03:33.280> punch<00:03:33.520> or<00:03:33.730> sword<00:03:34.090> stance

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
going for sucker punch or sword stance

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:35.910 
going for sucker punch or sword stance
so<00:03:34.810> I'm<00:03:34.900> just<00:03:35.050> going<00:03:35.170> to<00:03:35.230> go<00:03:35.350> for<00:03:35.500> the<00:03:35.530> T<00:03:35.740> wave

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
so I'm just going to go for the T wave

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.070 
so I'm just going to go for the T wave
and<00:03:36.160> even<00:03:36.490> if<00:03:36.700> he<00:03:36.730> does<00:03:37.120> evolve<00:03:37.420> neg<00:03:37.720> evolve

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
and even if he does evolve neg evolve

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.230 
and even if he does evolve neg evolve
into<00:03:38.530> mega<00:03:38.980> absol<00:03:39.310> and<00:03:39.550> got<00:03:39.640> metric<00:03:39.940> balance

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:40.240 
into mega absol and got metric balance

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.910 
into mega absol and got metric balance
it's<00:03:40.750> not<00:03:40.990> going<00:03:41.140> to<00:03:41.230> affect<00:03:41.260> me<00:03:41.620> because<00:03:41.709> the
