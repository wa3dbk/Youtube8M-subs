00:00:47.689 --> 00:00:47.699 
that I thought it started in high school

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:49.279 
that I thought it started in high school
until<00:00:47.879> I<00:00:48.090> went<00:00:48.300> through<00:00:48.570> my<00:00:48.660> mother's<00:00:48.989> things

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
until I went through my mother's things

until I went through my mother's things
and<00:00:49.649> there<00:00:50.430> was<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.579> little<00:00:50.879> book<00:00:51.000> about<00:00:51.360> like

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
spiral bindings and I had had to bend

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.209 
spiral bindings and I had had to bend
fifth<00:01:00.989> or<00:01:01.140> sixth<00:01:01.379> grade<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:01.799> there<00:01:01.979> was<00:01:02.100> my

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
fifth or sixth grade and there was my

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.700

first book right in there that there

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.230 
first book right in there that there
were<00:01:04.799> three<00:01:05.070> or<00:01:05.159> four<00:01:05.220> chapters<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.060> the

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
were three or four chapters and the

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.149 
were three or four chapters and the
story<00:01:06.479> had<00:01:06.690> started<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.530> I'm<00:01:07.680> gonna<00:01:07.920> go<00:01:08.009> back

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
story had started and I'm gonna go back

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.889 
story had started and I'm gonna go back
one<00:01:08.369> of<00:01:08.460> these<00:01:08.520> days<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:08.759> see<00:01:09.060> maybe<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.659> was<00:01:09.869> a

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:09.899 
one of these days and see maybe it was a

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:16.730 
one of these days and see maybe it was a
good<00:01:10.110> story<00:01:10.350> who<00:01:10.619> knows<00:01:14.899> wild<00:01:15.899> west<00:01:16.200> wind<00:01:16.500> came

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
good story who knows wild west wind came

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.310 
good story who knows wild west wind came
about<00:01:17.009> in<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.610> rather<00:01:17.820> unusual<00:01:17.970> way<00:01:18.899> of<00:01:19.050> course

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
about in a rather unusual way of course

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.020 
about in a rather unusual way of course
I<00:01:19.560> guess<00:01:19.920> there's<00:01:20.100> no<00:01:20.220> story<00:01:20.580> with<00:01:20.789> almost

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
I guess there's no story with almost

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.910 
I guess there's no story with almost
every<00:01:21.420> series<00:01:21.899> or<00:01:22.080> book<00:01:22.229> that<00:01:22.259> I<00:01:22.470> write<00:01:22.679> but

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
every series or book that I write but

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.410 
every series or book that I write but
the<00:01:23.039> story<00:01:23.310> behind<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.729> story<00:01:23.789> on<00:01:24.149> this<00:01:24.360> one

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
the story behind the story on this one

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.499 
the story behind the story on this one
is<00:01:24.869> that<00:01:25.860> I<00:01:26.130> had<00:01:26.460> just<00:01:26.670> watched<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.119> movie<00:01:27.240> as

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
is that I had just watched the movie as

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.899 
is that I had just watched the movie as
good<00:01:27.720> as<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:27.960> gets<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.440> I<00:01:28.710> because<00:01:29.069> I<00:01:29.100> love<00:01:29.280> the

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
good as it gets and I because I love the

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.309 
good as it gets and I because I love the
crazy<00:01:30.119> characters<00:01:30.720> in<00:01:30.929> there<00:01:31.080> and<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.259> could

00:01:31.309 --> 00:01:31.319 
crazy characters in there and I could

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:34.090 
crazy characters in there and I could
think<00:01:31.530> how<00:01:32.159> can<00:01:32.580> I<00:01:32.640> come<00:01:32.880> up<00:01:32.909> with<00:01:33.270> really

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
think how can I come up with really

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.590 
think how can I come up with really
really<00:01:35.100> unique<00:01:35.429> characters<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.390> so<00:01:36.479> I<00:01:36.509> was
