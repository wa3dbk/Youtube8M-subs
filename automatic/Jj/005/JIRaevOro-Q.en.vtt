00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
yj2 that's on a frame with a so it can

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.660 
yj2 that's on a frame with a so it can
be<00:00:22.199> towed<00:00:22.439> around<00:00:22.740> out<00:00:23.130> around<00:00:23.430> these

here is over 25 years old
it<00:00:45.930> was<00:00:46.079> repainted<00:00:46.710> probably<00:00:47.039> about<00:00:47.219> 11<00:00:47.520> years

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
it was repainted probably about 11 years

it was repainted probably about 11 years
ago<00:00:47.809> this<00:00:48.809> mixer<00:00:49.260> has<00:00:49.440> set<00:00:49.739> outside<00:00:49.940> every<00:00:50.940> day

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120

ago this mixer has set outside every day
of<00:00:51.270> its<00:00:51.420> life<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:52.620> I<00:00:52.739> think<00:00:52.949> about<00:00:53.070> eleven

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
of its life and I think about eleven

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.189 
of its life and I think about eleven
years<00:00:53.489> ago<00:00:53.910> it<00:00:54.030> had<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.210> new<00:00:54.390> bottom<00:00:54.780> put<00:00:54.960> in<00:00:55.079> it

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
years ago it had a new bottom put in it

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.650 
years ago it had a new bottom put in it
as<00:00:55.350> well<00:00:55.559> but<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.430> can<00:00:56.579> still<00:00:56.820> see<00:00:57.180> that<00:00:57.420> even

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
as well but you can still see that even

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:58.580 
as well but you can still see that even
though<00:00:57.750> it's<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:57.930> little<00:00:58.140> rough<00:00:58.320> around<00:00:58.440> the

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
though it's a little rough around the

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.830 
though it's a little rough around the
edges<00:00:58.649> it's<00:00:59.100> still<00:00:59.309> being<00:00:59.520> used<00:00:59.609> today<00:00:59.969> on

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
edges it's still being used today on

edges it's still being used today on
this<00:01:01.020> side<00:01:01.320> over<00:01:01.500> here<00:01:01.829> you<00:01:02.370> sit<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.699> little<00:01:02.910> bit

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
this side over here you sit a little bit

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.549 
this side over here you sit a little bit
more<00:01:03.210> about<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.539> flat<00:01:03.750> filler<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.229> how<00:01:04.379> it

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
more about the flat filler and how it

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.969 
more about the flat filler and how it
works<00:01:05.000> the<00:01:06.000> cell<00:01:06.840> packs<00:01:07.080> are<00:01:07.350> flats<00:01:07.590> they<00:01:07.770> come

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
works the cell packs are flats they come

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.710 
works the cell packs are flats they come
underneath<00:01:08.369> right<00:01:08.549> here<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:09.479> can<00:01:09.600> adjust

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
underneath right here you can adjust

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.750 
underneath right here you can adjust
this<00:01:10.140> door<00:01:10.409> -<00:01:10.650> whatever<00:01:11.010> open<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.460> you<00:01:11.549> won't

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
this door - whatever open and you won't

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.640 
this door - whatever open and you won't
so<00:01:12.000> you<00:01:12.090> can<00:01:12.240> control<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.600> soil<00:01:13.020> media<00:01:13.350> coming

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
so you can control the soil media coming

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.620 
so you can control the soil media coming
out<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.490> then<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:14.790> has<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:14.970> packing<00:01:15.420> roller

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
out and then it has a packing roller

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.840 
out and then it has a packing roller
right<00:01:15.840> here<00:01:16.080> that<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.259> turn<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.549> will<00:01:17.670> pack

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
right here that a turn and it will pack

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.539 
right here that a turn and it will pack
these<00:01:18.060> flats<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.780> can<00:01:19.590> catch<00:01:19.950> these<00:01:20.220> flats

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
these flats you can catch these flats

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.359 
these flats you can catch these flats
full<00:01:20.939> of<00:01:21.090> material<00:01:21.600> as<00:01:22.500> they<00:01:22.710> come<00:01:22.950> off<00:01:23.130> and

going<00:01:23.520> in<00:01:23.700> your<00:01:23.820> wagon<00:01:23.939> so<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.420> can<00:01:24.630> stick

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
going in your wagon so you can stick

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.690 
going in your wagon so you can stick
them<00:01:25.049> with<00:01:25.229> your<00:01:25.350> plant<00:01:25.560> material<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.159> the

them with your plant material and the

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.380 
them with your plant material and the
excess<00:01:27.150> goes<00:01:27.450> into<00:01:27.960> this<00:01:28.110> bucket<00:01:29.009> right<00:01:29.280> here

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
excess goes into this bucket right here

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.690 
excess goes into this bucket right here
this<00:01:30.390> is<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.570> simple<00:01:31.110> easy<00:01:31.320> unit<00:01:31.979> bear<00:01:32.369> in<00:01:32.490> mind

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
this is a simple easy unit bear in mind

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.060 
this is a simple easy unit bear in mind
if<00:01:33.360> he<00:01:33.540> was<00:01:33.689> in<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.900> fixed<00:01:34.200> location<00:01:34.799> you<00:01:34.920> could

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
if he was in a fixed location you could

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.190 
if he was in a fixed location you could
have<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.280> an<00:01:35.729> auger<00:01:36.240> right<00:01:36.420> here<00:01:36.659> with<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:36.840> soil

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
have a an auger right here with a soil

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.380 
have a an auger right here with a soil
return<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:38.310> would<00:01:38.460> take<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.790> excess<00:01:39.180> soil

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
return that would take the excess soil

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.880 
return that would take the excess soil
and<00:01:39.689> it<00:01:39.780> would<00:01:39.869> put<00:01:40.020> it<00:01:40.140> back<00:01:40.290> up<00:01:40.439> in<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.650> top

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
and it would put it back up in the top

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.399 
and it would put it back up in the top
and<00:01:41.130> if<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.250> do<00:01:41.520> that<00:01:41.759> you<00:01:42.720> can<00:01:42.869> fill<00:01:43.079> round

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
and if you do that you can fill round

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.200 
and if you do that you can fill round
pots<00:01:43.680> when<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.040> fill<00:01:44.250> round<00:01:44.549> pots<00:01:44.790> you<00:01:45.030> have<00:01:45.180> a

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
pots when you fill round pots you have a

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.240 
pots when you fill round pots you have a
lot<00:01:45.479> of<00:01:45.509> spillage<00:01:46.079> so<00:01:46.619> you<00:01:46.680> really<00:01:47.070> need<00:01:47.189> a

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
lot of spillage so you really need a

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.310
