00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:05.549
 hello everyone with you maxims and welcome 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.680
 welcome to channel a good choice 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.080
 today we will talk about processors 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.880
 ppm or rather what about now 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.620
 sold and what does it cost 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.450
 choose the fact is that you can not just 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.670
 take any processor stick it in 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.439
 any motherboard because on 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.900
 motherboard there is a so-called 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.990
 socket is a special connector for 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.119
 cpu different juices you have different 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.500
 number of contacts and are intended for 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.269
 different line of processors 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.920
 processor characteristics besides its 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.559
 clock frequency is always indicated 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.450
 necessary juices and the same designation 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.739
 there is on every motherboard on 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.930
 currently available 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:46.200
 processors under socket fm1 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:48.570
 fm2 am3 i'm 3 + them somewhere here is all 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.789
 for two of them, new processors are no longer 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.710
 what is sold is produced 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:57.539
 in fact leftovers in warehouses 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:59.820
 This socket am3 and fm1 am3 is the oldest of 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:03.059
 they began to produce processors for it 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.250
 at the beginning of 2009, 2 am2 lines were released 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.290
 athlon ii dolphins will not go 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.020
 in technical details just say 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.299
 that athlon is slightly simpler and accordingly 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.700
 Cheaper final expensive and manufacturer 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.610
 after the name is still a bunch of letters and numbers 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:22.110
 and how they do not get confused, see all 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.770
 just md athlon mdf and but then roman 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.420
 co2 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.729
 which means that it is a processor and 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.939
 second generation, everything is simple here 1 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.400
 no sale 3 too 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:34.320
 next letter x and number 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.479
 which means how many cores 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:45.140
 cpu x2 is 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:45.140
 dual core x 4 x 6 6 were still 3 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.330
 the next three digits indicate the total 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:51.940
 processor performance in its 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:55.390
 class that is quad and us 2x 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:59.350
 965 overall more powerful than the same 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.220
 quad fin 2x but 925 pluses 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.550
 these processors 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.830
 this is a very low price and very good 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.479
 performance meeting cafe 02 with 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.429
 can easily with many 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.470
 modern quad core process 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.050
 not even give a head start 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.750
 however, significant disadvantages are 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.280
 quite old processors and for them 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.959
 need old motherboards 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.700
 plus they consume many times more 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.820
 energy and much hotter 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.620
 whether to buy these processors if 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.480
 you collect the computer from scratch then rather 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.989
 there is nothing on the other hand if you 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.239
 has already 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.519
 incoming old motherboard you 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:36.750
 for some reason you want to go say with 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:39.160
 dual core 4 and 6 core processor 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.360
 while your budget is very limited then 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:45.790
 perhaps this is the only option 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.830
 In 2011, the company md came up with 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.860
 shove the video card directly into 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:53.410
 processor so there was a new socket fm1 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:56.380
 and new processor lineup 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:59.590
 getting the notation a4 a6 and a8 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:02.140
 some more figures go further than they 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.630
 more topics should be better but this is already 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.670
 not important because almost not 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.760
 left these processors selling 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:12.970
 and if you find them then they have a cheap 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.150
 the price is equal as well as their performance 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.950
 buy absolutely no sense with 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.049
 endangered species sorted out go 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.230
 to modernity and so two sockets 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:25.299
 n 3 + and fm2 what is the difference and there are two 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.530
 designed for processors with 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:28.600
 integrated video card 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.820
 about them you already had a little time to talk 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:34.470
 the ruler consists of five families 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:37.110
 this is the updated a4 a6 a8 and 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.970
 new representative a 10 also have 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.490
 processors called md athlon 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.450
 2 floor any figures but it's much the same 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.790
 her processors 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.710
 but with a disabled video core I donâ€™t 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.540
 managed to figure out exactly how the numbers in 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:50.730
 a title depends on the family 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.570
 characteristics of the processor is clear than 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.780
 the more the better 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:59.730
 I can only say that a4 and a6 are 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:01.830
 dual-core models and a8 i 10 4 models 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.170
 embedded video cores you now see 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:08.810
 on the screen if you omit dozens of tables and 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:11.550
 charts then the most expensive 10 6800 to 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.720
 all the price details are around here too 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.850
 must be listed now 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.859
 allow you to play the most modern 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:20.160
 toys only on medium and even low 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:22.200
 settings is it worth buying processors 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.780
 and a series if only for games 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.669
 rather no cost too high and 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.390
 power too low 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:30.600
 video core 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:32.700
 for the same 5 6 thousand you can buy quite 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.710
 normal processor and separate video 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.330
 a card that allows you to play 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.350
 most modern toys are already on 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.300
 high settings 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:42.200
 but for everyday and and office 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.660
 tasks and such as working with documents 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:47.480
 from the mail watching a movie is enough 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:49.970
 even the cheapest from 45 300 which 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.440
 costs about a thousand rubles in this 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.690
 case no longer need to spend money on 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.770
 a separate video card and it turns out quite 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:59.050
 economical option 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:02.500
 and here we are getting to the most delicious 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:05.120
 am3 processors 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:12.050
 socket am3 processors 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:13.940
 + + yes no messing around with the video card inside 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:16.100
 no overpayment for this embedded 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:19.100
 graphics and processor power do not share 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:23.480
 between the processor and the video card from 4 to 8 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:27.320
 cores super adequate pricing frequency 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:30.530
 CPUs from 3300 to 4200 megahertz 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.580
 perfectly accelerate and yes they are much 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:33.860
 hotter 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:37.520
 eat more energy than int Russians 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:39.980
 analogues but now is not about that by name 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:43.460
 the whole line starts with fx 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:44.690
 Next come 4 flowers. First points to 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:48.110
 Number of Cores 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:49.700
 well, the higher the next three the more 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:51.650
 processor frequency all place 

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:54.260
 the more the better so here if 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:56.780
 series processors are more suitable for 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:58.760
 text of this office use the 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:00.860
 fx is a real multimedia monster 

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:03.740
 these processes are great for both 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:06.650
 games and work with photoshop any 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:09.800
 3D editors and engineering 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:13.930
 calculations and all that fx comes to mind 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:16.880
 This is what the script is 

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:19.160
 a new socket fm2 has just appeared 

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:21.170
 plus that is, it is also intended to 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:24.700
 processes with integrated video card 

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:27.120
 there are only two new a10 processors so far 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:29.100
 they are expensive 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.949
 weak performance talk bye 

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:33.750
 especially not about anything as a conclusion and 

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:36.990
 if you need a completely budget option 

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:38.520
 exclusively for office or maybe 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:41.760
 for home but surf the internet 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:45.330
 listen to music then you should pay 

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:47.280
 focus on the processor about the series if you 

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.210
 not going to play of course in all 

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:50.460
 other cases 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:53.910
 games and work with graphics but all that 

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:57.360
 can come up the fx is your choice 

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:59.220
 personally my choice is fx-6350 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.729
 this is 6 nuclear beast with clock 

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:04.410
 frequency of 3 thousand 900 megahertz 

00:07:01.729 --> 00:07:08.010
 despite the fact that it costs about four 

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:09.810
 half a thousand rubles on it all in 

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:12.470
 upcoming releases we of course 

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:15.350
 let's talk about the processor from the company intel 

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:16.919
 video cards will make several comparisons 

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:19.250
 subscribe to nothing 

00:07:16.919 --> 00:07:19.250
 skip
