00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.990
 today we will tell you about 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.469
 foundation bolts and also a voucher 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:17.130
 show how they will be but often their 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:20.220
 also called anchor bolts in essence 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.800
 they are probably not like you 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.900
 called foundation bolts 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.740
 accordingly, we have them on sale under 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.029
 such a name exists 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.650
 they are made exclusively to order 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.110
 because it has great 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.180
 variety of both types like 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.440
 sizes 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.839
 performed predominantly from 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.769
 carbon steel 

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:49.699
 means if not specified by a friend is like 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:54.089
 the rule is steel 3 pt 5 5 category 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:01:01.080
 means and made of steel 10 of steel 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:01:04.619
 20 you if you need a travel 9 g2 with too 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:07.340
 under the order all this is possible means 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.280
 foundation bolts of their type 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.179
 divided into several categories and 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.579
 respectively in the most powerful in 

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:19.070
 designation this type is usually 

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:23.909
 it is indicated to be returned in numbers 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:25.710
 for example, 1.1 says that in this 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:30.530
 the bolt has such 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:35.340
 configuration usual bolt curved 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:39.710
 letter so to speak for what these languages 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:45.719
 it is clear when you are but this peaceful bolt 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:49.999
 fill in the ground here this one glitch it 

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:53.340
 does not give and expressed bolt 

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:55.770
 out when you and your finger and b does not give 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.799
 opportunity he turns inside 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:02.260
 bodies of concrete where you will be tightening 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.730
 golam steel nuts 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:08.350
 sizes they can be absolutely 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:09.970
 different from 16 to there probably 46 and 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.640
 in general, you can actually do any 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:17.370
 speaking is a steel 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.370
 rod on which the thread is cut 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.190
 thread length 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:27.720
 also regulated by guest 3g 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:31.410
 allows you to wind more than three nuts on 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:37.950
 actually more and do not need 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:37.950
 the body of concrete is poured about them let's say so 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:45.239
 the essence of the fact that the top will 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.730
 steel structure will be located 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:51.360
 and must be dragged out at least two 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.940
 bolt standards standard 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:03:00.060
 we complete this bolt is one 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:06.260
 the puck here and move and eat 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:06.260
 construction is still possible to enclose was 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.650
 solve standard too 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.900
 frame sizes 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:22.250
 if so indicated in the structure may tozh 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:25.170
 be used poured shelf 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:28.530
 puts on the construction goes further if 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:31.910
 need to take the washer the bolt washer and two 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:35.450
 Gadget why move understandable 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.450
 2 is 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:49.510
 tightens ordering the first nut to 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:52.250
 she did not spin it by the way yet 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.909
 Why is there no standard 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.629
 blood pitch 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:57.340
 In principle, she loses two nuts 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:01.220
 meaning 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:04.900
 as itself prevents unwinding 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.900
 the nuts started there are two nuts then 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:14.690
 but also by types how to distinguish 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:16.870
 shakes by design type 11 it 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:21.739
 just and drives 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:25.970
 type for example 12 is this way 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:29.000
 made use of one type or another 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.590
 foundation bolt implies 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.479
 design difference 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:40.750
 concrete sense so the foundations as 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:42.650
 the rule is there and not everywhere there is the possibility 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.340
 put on 100 km simple 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.590
 construction 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:52.480
 you can intervene there formwork 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:56.530
 take here let's say this further means 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:59.730
 let's say there are some more types well here in 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:01.770
 space you are about 14 species 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:03.539
 here 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:06.870
 here we are not all represented 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:08.669
 kind of and since there a couple 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.650
 category they are quite complex 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:12.620
 are an integral foundation was 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.360
 bolted with using it tubes 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:18.770
 used very rarely but also can 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.770
 be made to order 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:24.810
 use in exceptional cases where 

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:27.440
 another design fits well here 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:31.500
 presented common 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:35.330
 foundation bolt with anchor plate here 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:39.210
 I say so the role of the bend is used 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:42.569
 Here is such an anchor plate that's it 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:48.289
 used in situations when 

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:50.400
 big learned vertical axis 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:52.860
 prevent the bolt from being pulled out 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.479
 let's say a novelty because these 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:58.560
 foundations under and they can work 

00:05:54.479 --> 00:06:01.430
 also planes separately 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:03.930
 for example, cut to horizontal 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:05.490
 planes can work vertical 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:07.229
 plane but pulling out 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:09.020
 can work accordingly in two 

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:11.370
 planes at the same time 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.780
 accordingly based on these bib 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:17.340
 design is selected 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:21.940
 well, the simplest type 5 is just that 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:24.670
 such pin and here so to speak with thread 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:29.590
 for whom is the cheapest easiest 

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:31.780
 he certainly has his drawbacks to this 

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:33.700
 plan that there is such a bolt of the past 

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:34.420
 pour do not he and then when 

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:38.490
 twisting 

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:42.880
 there is a likelihood and his turning 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:44.890
 In general, this type is more often used 

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:48.630
 when concrete it directly 

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:53.140
 welded to the arcade of the admiral 

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:55.690
 when he is there to look is not turned 

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:59.530
 will be well and here's the most classic thing 

00:06:55.690 --> 00:07:04.000
 to have discovered it 61 type 

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:06.360
 this here with this very with expansion to 

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.360
 higher 

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:14.870
 This boss is characterized by the fact that you can 

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:20.510
 already install flooded pit drill 

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:23.000
 the hole here of this center we get it there 

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:26.540
 lower it works concord as an actor 

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:30.050
 when wrapping up the bonus starts 

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:31.750
 do not investigate how reliably there 

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:34.420
 fixed 

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:36.680
 Well, actually here are the main types 

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:41.870
 This help can be ordered 

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:44.590
 sizes of almost any of all these bolts 

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:44.590
 and can be made
