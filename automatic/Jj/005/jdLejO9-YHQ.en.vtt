00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
speaker we don't have an LED flash here

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.539 
speaker we don't have an LED flash here
but<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:12.299> camera<00:01:12.720> is<00:01:12.990> actually<00:01:13.260> pretty<00:01:13.950> okay

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
but the camera is actually pretty okay

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.789 
but the camera is actually pretty okay
so<00:01:15.150> we'll<00:01:15.360> have<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.659> quick<00:01:15.960> look<00:01:15.990> at<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.290> camera

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
so we'll have a quick look at the camera

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.580 
so we'll have a quick look at the camera
and<00:01:16.979> can<00:01:17.610> also<00:01:17.759> do<00:01:18.000> video<00:01:18.299> I<00:01:18.360> think<00:01:18.659> it's<00:01:18.810> 720p

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
and can also do video I think it's 720p

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.490 
and can also do video I think it's 720p
video<00:01:20.040> so<00:01:20.880> if<00:01:21.479> we<00:01:21.600> take<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.869> picture<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:22.380> this

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
video so if we take a picture of this

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.570 
video so if we take a picture of this
text<00:01:22.890> here<00:01:23.330> let's<00:01:24.330> see<00:01:25.130> how<00:01:26.130> did<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.430> turn<00:01:26.640> out

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
text here let's see how did it turn out

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:34.940 
text here let's see how did it turn out
so<00:01:29.580> it<00:01:29.730> is<00:01:31.160> quite<00:01:32.160> crisp<00:01:33.120> and<00:01:33.300> sharp<00:01:33.360> if<00:01:34.320> you
