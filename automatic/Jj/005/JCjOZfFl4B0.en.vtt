00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.290
 Hello everyone 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.090
 then we are here to compare the two 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:16.350
 not all objectives of the jacket 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:22.619
 of the fs15 165 range the stm while 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:24.480
 the other on 17 85 the 18135 measures 96 mm 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.830
 in length and diameter of the filter and of 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:32.579
 67 mm and weighs about 480 grams while the 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:35.610
 17 85 in length measures 92 mm of 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:41.219
 filter diameter is always 67 mm e 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:43.170
 weighs about 475 grams and 18135 is composed 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.090
 from sixteen the anti tv divided into 12 groups 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.510
 at a minimum focusing distance 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:52.590
 of 109 cm and the maximum magnification of 0 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.870
 28 while 17 85 is composed of 17 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.149
 art divided into 12 groups by one 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.090
 minimum focusing distance of 35 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:03.780
 cm maximum magnification of three red-hot 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.760
 the diaphragm of 18135 is composed of 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.479
 seven the valley and has a minimum opening 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.760
 of 22 38 while that of 17 85 ha 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.390
 composed of 6 is not a minimum opening 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.979
 of 22 and 32 these features that them 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.630
 make two targets quite poly 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.640
 for macros but what differentiates them 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.640
 substantially they are two systems of 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.040
 autofocus and 18135 as mentioned 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.490
 in the beginning a lot of finance now would have 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.110
 of 165 a summer home of anne is 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.409
 ideal for more videos since since 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.360
 fluid and silent and knows it well 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.130
 I answer ideal for photographs for 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.009
 the videos has not much invited since 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.630
 noises will be produced during the 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.030
 focusing that some would find it 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.350
 audio track of the recording for 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.860
 let him understand better what I am 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.659
 speaking 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.659
 here comes a construction video 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.400
 we will have to remedy the break six dates 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.140
 2 hassans with an external microphone but 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.480
 however the video would result from the fact 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.130
 which is not much more and the omitted fire 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.540
 let us know what you think instead 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.160
 you me maybe what are yours 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.750
 experiences with these goals 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.750
 I go to everything to the next one
