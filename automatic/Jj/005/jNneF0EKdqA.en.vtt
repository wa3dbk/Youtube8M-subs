00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.300 
feel that because he were really solid
in<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.420> defense<00:00:21.750> but<00:00:22.380> I<00:00:22.560> managed<00:00:22.859> to<00:00:22.920> get<00:00:23.130> this

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
in the defense but I managed to get this

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
but this was actually my first real

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.729 
but this was actually my first real
chance<00:00:33.270> in<00:00:33.420> this<00:00:33.600> game<00:00:33.870> because<00:00:34.020> his<00:00:34.380> defense

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
chance in this game because his defense

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.610 
chance in this game because his defense
as<00:00:35.130> I<00:00:35.250> said<00:00:35.460> we<00:00:36.030> really<00:00:36.059> solid<00:00:36.690> but<00:00:37.290> a<00:00:37.320> nice

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
as I said we really solid but a nice

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.530 
as I said we really solid but a nice
goal<00:00:37.920> Maki's<00:00:38.430> been<00:00:38.670> past<00:00:38.879> two<00:00:39.090> players<00:00:39.329> and

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
goal Maki's been past two players and

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.229 
goal Maki's been past two players and
then<00:00:40.350> in<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.620> 45th<00:00:41.100> minute<00:00:41.250> my<00:00:41.670> opponent<00:00:42.090> gets

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
then in the 45th minute my opponent gets

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.819 
then in the 45th minute my opponent gets
this<00:00:42.450> chance<00:00:42.750> it<00:00:43.050> hits<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.410> heel<00:00:43.620> of<00:00:43.800> my

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
this chance it hits the heel of my

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.290 
this chance it hits the heel of my
defender<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.489> look<00:00:44.879> at<00:00:44.969> this

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
defender and look at this

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.020 
defender and look at this
what<00:00:45.600> is<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.110> keeper<00:00:46.440> doing<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.070> my<00:00:47.640> opponent

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
what is the keeper doing and my opponent

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.340 
what is the keeper doing and my opponent
gets<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.300> lucky<00:00:48.809> rebound<00:00:49.379> goal<00:00:49.820> and<00:00:50.820> as<00:00:51.570> I<00:00:52.170> said

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
gets a lucky rebound goal and as I said

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.959 
gets a lucky rebound goal and as I said
he<00:00:52.649> was<00:00:52.680> really<00:00:52.980> solid<00:00:53.160> in<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.460> defense<00:00:53.760> and

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
he was really solid in the defense and

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.389 
he was really solid in the defense and
when<00:00:54.180> when<00:00:54.570> I'm<00:00:54.660> not<00:00:54.780> in<00:00:55.079> front<00:00:55.110> I<00:00:55.649> tend<00:00:56.100> not<00:00:56.190> to

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
when when I'm not in front I tend not to

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.099 
when when I'm not in front I tend not to
do<00:00:56.640> that<00:00:56.820> many<00:00:57.030> skill<00:00:57.329> moves<00:00:57.539> because<00:00:57.780> I'm

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
do that many skill moves because I'm

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.709 
do that many skill moves because I'm
still<00:00:58.289> competitive<00:00:58.680> I<00:00:59.039> want<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.430> win<00:00:59.609> so<00:01:00.359> I

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
still competitive I want to win so I

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.200 
still competitive I want to win so I
kept<00:01:01.320> pushing<00:01:01.559> on<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:02.070> get<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.460> goal<00:01:02.699> but<00:01:02.969> I<00:01:03.000> just

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
kept pushing on to get a goal but I just

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.149 
kept pushing on to get a goal but I just
couldn't<00:01:03.449> break<00:01:03.690> his<00:01:03.870> defense<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.409> was<00:01:04.920> not

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
couldn't break his defense and was not

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.440 
couldn't break his defense and was not
on<00:01:05.189> till<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.610> end<00:01:05.640> of<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.060> game<00:01:06.240> that<00:01:06.270> I

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
on till the end of the game that I

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.200 
on till the end of the game that I
really<00:01:06.750> got<00:01:06.930> some<00:01:07.350> chances<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.340> see<00:01:08.549> I<00:01:08.580> pass

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
really got some chances you see I pass

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.840 
really got some chances you see I pass
it<00:01:09.390> around<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:09.990> find<00:01:10.530> Elka's<00:01:10.890> on<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.250> I

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
it around and I find Elka's on and I

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.600 
it around and I find Elka's on and I
actually<00:01:12.000> thought<00:01:12.330> this<00:01:12.840> shot<00:01:13.140> went<00:01:13.920> wide<00:01:14.010> but

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
actually thought this shot went wide but

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.070 
actually thought this shot went wide but
apparently<00:01:14.939> he's<00:01:15.119> keeper<00:01:15.479> saved<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.020> I

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
apparently he's keeper saved it and I

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.020 
apparently he's keeper saved it and I
get<00:01:16.290> another<00:01:16.530> corner<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.189> Ronaldinho

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
get another corner and Ronaldinho

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.600 
get another corner and Ronaldinho
crosses<00:01:18.540> in<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:18.869> we<00:01:19.110> got<00:01:19.290> dead<00:01:19.619> heading<00:01:20.400> it

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
crosses in and we got dead heading it

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.090 
crosses in and we got dead heading it
over<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.000> goal<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.560> this<00:01:22.560> was<00:01:22.740> pretty<00:01:22.890> much

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
over the goal and this was pretty much

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.100 
over the goal and this was pretty much
the<00:01:23.250> end<00:01:23.280> of<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.580> game<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:23.939> was<00:01:24.150> so<00:01:24.450> frustrating

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
the end of a game and was so frustrating

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.990 
the end of a game and was so frustrating
letting<00:01:25.470> like<00:01:25.799> loosen<00:01:26.310> those<00:01:26.400> two<00:01:26.640> points

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
letting like loosen those two points

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.850 
letting like loosen those two points
because<00:01:27.150> I<00:01:27.600> thought<00:01:28.020> he<00:01:28.200> got<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.380> really<00:01:28.710> lucky

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
because I thought he got a really lucky

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.090 
because I thought he got a really lucky
go<00:01:29.100> there<00:01:29.369> but<00:01:30.299> I<00:01:30.540> go<00:01:31.049> out<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.409> by<00:01:31.500> Felipe

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
go there but I go out and by Felipe

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.429 
go there but I go out and by Felipe
Santana<00:01:32.549> as<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:32.939> substitute<00:01:33.659> for<00:01:33.689> my<00:01:34.049> center

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
Santana as a substitute for my center

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.490 
Santana as a substitute for my center
back<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:34.770> then<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:35.520> go<00:01:35.790> out<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.180> strength<00:01:37.170> my

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
back and then I go out and strength my

counter-attack<00:04:51.539> he's<00:04:51.930> always<00:04:52.289> standing<00:04:52.919> near

00:04:53.089 --> 00:04:53.099 
counter-attack he's always standing near

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:55.010 
counter-attack he's always standing near
the<00:04:53.250> midfield<00:04:53.639> and<00:04:53.909> ready<00:04:54.300> to<00:04:54.389> take<00:04:54.659> the<00:04:54.840> ball

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
the midfield and ready to take the ball

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.930 
the midfield and ready to take the ball
so<00:04:55.620> a<00:04:55.650> really<00:04:56.129> good<00:04:56.280> player<00:04:56.490> hanging<00:04:56.819> in<00:04:56.879> the

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
so a really good player hanging in the

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.490 
so a really good player hanging in the
sentiment<00:04:57.419> instead<00:04:57.750> of<00:04:57.840> having<00:04:57.990> on<00:04:58.199> the<00:04:58.319> left

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
sentiment instead of having on the left

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.550 
sentiment instead of having on the left
center<00:04:58.680> mid<00:04:58.949> and<00:04:59.690> as<00:05:00.690> you<00:05:00.780> can<00:05:00.900> see<00:05:00.960> here<00:05:01.289> I'm

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
center mid and as you can see here I'm

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.499 
center mid and as you can see here I'm
just<00:05:01.830> I'm<00:05:02.130> having<00:05:02.669> everything<00:05:03.060> in<00:05:03.180> this<00:05:03.270> game

00:05:03.499 --> 00:05:03.509 
just I'm having everything in this game

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:06.110 
just I'm having everything in this game
because<00:05:03.930> this<00:05:04.740> I<00:05:04.889> just<00:05:05.130> felt<00:05:05.370> good<00:05:05.729> to<00:05:05.940> play

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
because this I just felt good to play

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.399 
because this I just felt good to play
with<00:05:06.300> I<00:05:06.330> enjoyed<00:05:06.690> playing<00:05:06.720> with<00:05:06.990> this<00:05:07.199> side

00:05:07.399 --> 00:05:07.409 
with I enjoyed playing with this side

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:09.890 
with I enjoyed playing with this side
and<00:05:07.620> having<00:05:08.130> pron<00:05:08.699> s<00:05:08.940> mo<00:05:09.180> on<00:05:09.330> the<00:05:09.509> midfield

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
and having pron s mo on the midfield

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.620 
and having pron s mo on the midfield
really<00:05:10.229> gave<00:05:10.919> some<00:05:11.159> I<00:05:11.490> guess<00:05:11.789> balance<00:05:12.270> to<00:05:12.479> the

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
really gave some I guess balance to the

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.050 
really gave some I guess balance to the
team<00:05:12.960> both<00:05:13.620> forward<00:05:13.979> and<00:05:14.069> backward<00:05:14.250> and<00:05:14.789> as

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
team both forward and backward and as

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.879 
team both forward and backward and as
you<00:05:15.150> see<00:05:15.300> I<00:05:15.330> get<00:05:15.659> a<00:05:15.690> penalty<00:05:16.020> somehow<00:05:16.620> I'm<00:05:16.830> not

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:16.889 
you see I get a penalty somehow I'm not

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:19.580 
you see I get a penalty somehow I'm not
sure<00:05:17.310> how<00:05:17.699> this<00:05:18.000> was<00:05:18.150> a<00:05:18.210> penalty<00:05:18.449> but<00:05:19.380> I'll

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
sure how this was a penalty but I'll

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.430 
sure how this was a penalty but I'll
take<00:05:19.860> it<00:05:19.919> and<00:05:20.159> I<00:05:20.550> thought<00:05:20.729> hey<00:05:21.030> I<00:05:21.300> got<00:05:21.690> PLO<00:05:22.110> he's

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
take it and I thought hey I got PLO he's

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.040 
take it and I thought hey I got PLO he's
got<00:05:22.620> a<00:05:22.650> pretty<00:05:22.949> sweet<00:05:23.159> penalty<00:05:24.030> in<00:05:24.240> the<00:05:24.780> the

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
got a pretty sweet penalty in the the

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.409 
got a pretty sweet penalty in the the
euros<00:05:25.349> penalty<00:05:26.129> Shula<00:05:26.430> and<00:05:26.610> look<00:05:27.030> at<00:05:27.150> this<00:05:27.300> a

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:27.419 
euros penalty Shula and look at this a

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:29.600 
euros penalty Shula and look at this a
nice<00:05:28.050> chip<00:05:28.349> and<00:05:28.560> actually<00:05:28.979> he<00:05:29.069> actually<00:05:29.370> dives

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
nice chip and actually he actually dives

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.659 
nice chip and actually he actually dives
to<00:05:29.789> the<00:05:29.879> side<00:05:30.090> and<00:05:30.300> I<00:05:30.419> score<00:05:30.690> the<00:05:30.810> goal<00:05:30.990> and<00:05:31.800> as

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:32.669 
to the side and I score the goal and as

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:34.070 
to the side and I score the goal and as
you<00:05:32.789> will<00:05:32.909> watch<00:05:33.150> as<00:05:33.479> you<00:05:33.599> can<00:05:33.719> see<00:05:33.900> in<00:05:33.990> the

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
you will watch as you can see in the

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.320 
you will watch as you can see in the
replay<00:05:34.229> in<00:05:34.560> just<00:05:34.830> a<00:05:34.919> moment<00:05:35.280> which<00:05:35.789> i<00:05:35.880> think<00:05:36.180> is

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
replay in just a moment which i think is

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:37.850 
replay in just a moment which i think is
a<00:05:36.389> pretty<00:05:36.539> cool<00:05:36.780> replay<00:05:37.139> look<00:05:37.380> at<00:05:37.500> that<00:05:37.650> that's

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860 
a pretty cool replay look at that that's

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.219 
a pretty cool replay look at that that's
a<00:05:37.949> nice<00:05:38.130> angle<00:05:38.400> but<00:05:39.270> as<00:05:39.569> you<00:05:39.659> can<00:05:39.780> see<00:05:39.870> he<00:05:40.020> hits

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:40.229 
a nice angle but as you can see he hits

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:41.899 
a nice angle but as you can see he hits
the<00:05:40.380> ball<00:05:40.530> he<00:05:40.800> stands<00:05:41.130> still<00:05:41.280> and<00:05:41.490> then<00:05:41.759> he

00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:41.909 
the ball he stands still and then he

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:43.850 
the ball he stands still and then he
dives<00:05:42.180> I<00:05:42.509> can't<00:05:42.900> believe<00:05:43.169> what<00:05:43.319> my<00:05:43.469> opponent

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 
dives I can't believe what my opponent

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.559 
dives I can't believe what my opponent
was<00:05:43.919> thinking<00:05:44.340> because<00:05:44.669> he<00:05:45.180> could<00:05:45.330> have<00:05:45.419> saved

00:05:45.559 --> 00:05:45.569 
was thinking because he could have saved

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:47.059 
was thinking because he could have saved
that<00:05:45.750> he<00:05:45.960> shouldn't<00:05:46.259> have<00:05:46.319> moved<00:05:46.620> to<00:05:46.800> the<00:05:46.889> side

00:05:47.059 --> 00:05:47.069 
that he shouldn't have moved to the side

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:50.360 
that he shouldn't have moved to the side
but<00:05:47.759> I'll<00:05:47.969> take<00:05:48.210> it<00:05:48.270> and<00:05:48.599> I'm<00:05:48.779> up<00:05:48.960> to<00:05:49.199> nil<00:05:49.440> and<00:05:50.250> I

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.370 
but I'll take it and I'm up to nil and I

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.519 
but I'll take it and I'm up to nil and I
keep<00:05:50.819> doing<00:05:50.849> those<00:05:51.180> skills<00:05:51.539> and<00:05:52.050> lamella<00:05:52.380> is

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:52.529 
keep doing those skills and lamella is

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:54.140 
keep doing those skills and lamella is
actually<00:05:52.860> pretty<00:05:53.039> good<00:05:53.219> as<00:05:53.370> well<00:05:53.550> and<00:05:53.759> he

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.150 
actually pretty good as well and he

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:55.850 
actually pretty good as well and he
feels<00:05:54.180> a<00:05:54.539> lot<00:05:54.659> better<00:05:54.930> than<00:05:55.139> killing<00:05:55.349> as<00:05:55.650> well

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860 
feels a lot better than killing as well

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:58.459 
feels a lot better than killing as well
so<00:05:56.490> I'm<00:05:56.759> most<00:05:57.029> likely<00:05:57.240> going<00:05:57.599> to<00:05:57.840> sell<00:05:58.020> Kelvin

00:05:58.459 --> 00:05:58.469 
so I'm most likely going to sell Kelvin

00:05:58.469 --> 00:06:00.769 
so I'm most likely going to sell Kelvin
because<00:05:58.620> a<00:05:59.099> silver<00:05:59.909> player<00:06:00.090> just<00:06:00.389> won't<00:06:00.599> cut

00:06:00.769 --> 00:06:00.779 
because a silver player just won't cut

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:02.629 
because a silver player just won't cut
it<00:06:00.810> against<00:06:01.229> gold<00:06:01.440> players<00:06:01.710> and<00:06:01.979> as<00:06:02.279> when<00:06:02.550> you

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:02.639 
it against gold players and as when you

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:04.339 
it against gold players and as when you
play<00:06:02.819> seasons<00:06:03.300> it's<00:06:03.659> about<00:06:03.870> bringing<00:06:04.169> your

00:06:04.339 --> 00:06:04.349 
play seasons it's about bringing your

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:07.580 
play seasons it's about bringing your
best<00:06:04.529> squad<00:06:04.889> not<00:06:05.250> squats<00:06:06.240> that<00:06:06.539> are<00:06:06.840> even<00:06:07.259> like

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:07.590 
best squad not squats that are even like

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:10.279 
best squad not squats that are even like
him<00:06:08.039> it<00:06:08.669> wasn't<00:06:09.000> FIFA<00:06:09.210> 12<00:06:09.449> where<00:06:09.750> if<00:06:09.990> you<00:06:10.139> had<00:06:10.259> a

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:10.289 
him it wasn't FIFA 12 where if you had a

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:11.930 
him it wasn't FIFA 12 where if you had a
silver<00:06:10.740> side<00:06:10.919> you'd<00:06:11.130> meet<00:06:11.340> the<00:06:11.460> silver<00:06:11.759> side

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:11.940 
silver side you'd meet the silver side

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.330 
silver side you'd meet the silver side
here's<00:06:12.659> about<00:06:12.900> getting<00:06:13.289> the<00:06:13.650> best<00:06:13.889> squad<00:06:14.159> and

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:14.340 
here's about getting the best squad and

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:17.269 
here's about getting the best squad and
just<00:06:14.729> go<00:06:15.090> at<00:06:15.270> it<00:06:15.300> so<00:06:15.599> I'm<00:06:16.590> most<00:06:16.830> likely<00:06:17.039> going

00:06:17.269 --> 00:06:17.279 
just go at it so I'm most likely going

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:18.709 
just go at it so I'm most likely going
to<00:06:17.400> sell<00:06:17.639> Kelvin<00:06:18.029> and<00:06:18.180> see<00:06:18.270> if<00:06:18.360> I<00:06:18.419> can<00:06:18.539> get<00:06:18.690> a

00:06:18.709 --> 00:06:18.719 
to sell Kelvin and see if I can get a

00:06:18.719 --> 00:06:23.269 
to sell Kelvin and see if I can get a
player<00:06:18.960> like<00:06:19.169> Neymar<00:06:20.120> maybe<00:06:21.229> ibrahimovic<00:06:22.279> but

00:06:23.269 --> 00:06:23.279 
player like Neymar maybe ibrahimovic but

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:25.159 
player like Neymar maybe ibrahimovic but
