it's<00:00:03.870> a<00:00:04.049> day<00:00:04.200> late<00:00:04.230> but<00:00:04.740> let's<00:00:05.520> go<00:00:05.670> ahead<00:00:05.910> deal

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
it's a day late but let's go ahead deal

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.150 
it's a day late but let's go ahead deal
with<00:00:06.660> the<00:00:07.080> Jesus<00:00:07.620> Easter<00:00:08.069> myth<00:00:09.740> first<00:00:10.740> off<00:00:10.950> in

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160

science<00:00:11.690> things<00:00:12.690> have<00:00:12.870> to<00:00:12.900> be<00:00:13.049> repeatable

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:14.240 
science things have to be repeatable

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.269 
science things have to be repeatable
understandable<00:00:15.240> if<00:00:16.070> something<00:00:17.070> is<00:00:17.190> an

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
understandable if something is an

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.700 
understandable if something is an
anomaly<00:00:17.550> that<00:00:17.880> cannot<00:00:18.300> be<00:00:18.359> explained<00:00:18.990> and<00:00:19.320> has

anomaly that cannot be explained and has

anomaly that cannot be explained and has
never<00:00:20.100> been<00:00:20.310> repeated<00:00:20.789> again<00:00:21.029> let's<00:00:21.510> say<00:00:21.689> in

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
never been repeated again let's say in

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.929 
never been repeated again let's say in
like<00:00:22.080> thousands<00:00:22.830> or<00:00:23.070> potentially<00:00:23.580> millions

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
like thousands or potentially millions

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.540 
like thousands or potentially millions
of<00:00:24.119> years<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:24.800> defies<00:00:25.800> everything<00:00:26.279> we

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
of years and defies everything we

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.140 
of years and defies everything we
understand<00:00:26.970> about<00:00:27.090> science<00:00:27.750> then<00:00:28.939> either<00:00:29.939> the

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
understand about science then either the

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.269 
understand about science then either the
person<00:00:30.449> lied<00:00:30.960> or<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.590> research<00:00:32.009> was<00:00:32.250> done

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
person lied or the research was done

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.030 
person lied or the research was done
very<00:00:32.700> poorly<00:00:33.059> and<00:00:33.570> they<00:00:34.140> accidentally<00:00:34.980> gave

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
very poorly and they accidentally gave

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.319 
very poorly and they accidentally gave
the<00:00:35.370> wrong<00:00:35.520> results<00:00:36.120> so<00:00:36.840> here's<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.230> problem

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 
the wrong results so here's the problem

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:43.130 
the wrong results so here's the problem
we<00:00:39.329> understand<00:00:40.079> in<00:00:40.610> modern<00:00:41.610> medicine<00:00:41.989> that<00:00:42.989> it

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
we understand in modern medicine that it

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.680 
we understand in modern medicine that it
is<00:00:43.320> totally<00:00:44.129> impossible<00:00:44.250> for<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.000> person<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.390> be

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
is totally impossible for a person to be

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.100 
is totally impossible for a person to be
deceased<00:00:46.320> for<00:00:46.800> three<00:00:47.100> years<00:00:47.399> for<00:00:48.390> three<00:00:48.899> years

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
deceased for three years for three years

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.049 
deceased for three years for three years
oh<00:00:49.200> my<00:00:49.320> god<00:00:49.500> it's<00:00:50.010> totally<00:00:50.430> wrong<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.850> be<00:00:50.969> to

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
oh my god it's totally wrong to be to

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.639 
oh my god it's totally wrong to be to
cease<00:00:51.239> for<00:00:51.449> three<00:00:51.690> days<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:54.230> regain<00:00:55.230> brain

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
cease for three days and regain brain

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.020 
cease for three days and regain brain
function<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.670> life<00:00:57.090> function<00:00:58.370> it<00:00:59.370> takes<00:00:59.699> just

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
function and life function it takes just

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.540 
function and life function it takes just
a<00:01:00.149> few<00:01:00.300> minutes<00:01:00.359> for<00:01:01.079> brain<00:01:01.500> death<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:02.190> occur

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
a few minutes for brain death to occur

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.410 
a few minutes for brain death to occur
with<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.120> black<00:01:03.570> of<00:01:03.870> oxygen<00:01:04.739> there's<00:01:05.610> no<00:01:06.150> way

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
with a black of oxygen there's no way

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.539 
with a black of oxygen there's no way
that<00:01:06.900> after<00:01:07.200> three<00:01:07.770> days<00:01:07.979> of<00:01:08.220> your<00:01:08.369> brain

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
that after three days of your brain

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.060 
that after three days of your brain
being<00:01:08.850> dead<00:01:09.150> that<00:01:09.689> you<00:01:09.780> could<00:01:09.960> come<00:01:10.110> back<00:01:10.290> at

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
being dead that you could come back at

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.370 
being dead that you could come back at
best<00:01:12.060> you<00:01:12.450> would<00:01:12.600> be<00:01:12.750> like<00:01:12.990> one<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.170> those

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
best you would be like one of those

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.640 
best you would be like one of those
zombie<00:01:14.070> movies<00:01:14.400> we've<00:01:14.640> seen<00:01:14.850> on<00:01:15.030> TV<00:01:15.650> the

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
zombie movies we've seen on TV the

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.850 
zombie movies we've seen on TV the
second<00:01:17.130> thing<00:01:17.310> is<00:01:17.549> after<00:01:17.850> you<00:01:18.479> die<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:19.500> decay

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
second thing is after you die the decay

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.980 
second thing is after you die the decay
process<00:01:20.430> which<00:01:20.580> is<00:01:20.729> continually<00:01:21.420> going<00:01:21.630> on<00:01:21.869> in

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
process which is continually going on in

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.469 
process which is continually going on in
your<00:01:22.110> body<00:01:22.259> just<00:01:23.250> totally<00:01:23.700> takes<00:01:24.210> charge

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
your body just totally takes charge

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.020 
your body just totally takes charge
there's<00:01:25.380> no<00:01:25.860> more<00:01:26.100> new<00:01:26.460> cells<00:01:26.759> being

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
there's no more new cells being

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.410 
there's no more new cells being
reproduced<00:01:27.360> so<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.200> old<00:01:28.409> cells<00:01:28.829> die<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.579> they

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
reproduced so the old cells die and they

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.749 
reproduced so the old cells die and they
die<00:01:30.659> die<00:01:30.720> die<00:01:30.930> quickly<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:32.159> somewhere<00:01:32.549> as

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
die die die quickly and somewhere as

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.649 
die die die quickly and somewhere as
warm<00:01:33.240> as<00:01:33.810> let's<00:01:34.380> say<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.890> Middle<00:01:35.220> East<00:01:35.659> it's

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
warm as let's say the Middle East it's

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.410 
warm as let's say the Middle East it's
pretty<00:01:36.810> warm<00:01:36.990> their<00:01:37.259> bodies<00:01:38.090> kind<00:01:39.090> of<00:01:39.210> decay

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
pretty warm their bodies kind of decay

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.030 
pretty warm their bodies kind of decay
quickly<00:01:40.280> so<00:01:41.280> we're<00:01:41.759> talking<00:01:42.210> about<00:01:42.509> a

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
quickly so we're talking about a

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.710 
quickly so we're talking about a
brain-dead<00:01:44.040> decayed<00:01:44.640> zombie<00:01:45.210> that<00:01:45.509> you<00:01:45.600> would

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
brain-dead decayed zombie that you would

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.319 
brain-dead decayed zombie that you would
have<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:46.049> have<00:01:46.430> so<00:01:47.430> that's<00:01:47.640> just<00:01:47.790> it's<00:01:48.270> just

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
have to have so that's just it's just

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.780 
have to have so that's just it's just
not<00:01:48.570> possible<00:01:48.780> because<00:01:49.380> it's<00:01:50.100> never<00:01:50.280> happened

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
not possible because it's never happened

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.130 
not possible because it's never happened
again<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.689> we<00:01:52.140> live<00:01:52.470> in<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:53.520> universe<00:01:54.079> full<00:01:55.079> of

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
again and we live in a universe full of

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.030 
again and we live in a universe full of
natural<00:01:55.770> laws<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.990> you<00:01:57.990> can't<00:01:58.530> go<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:58.770> find

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
natural laws and you can't go to find

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.819 
natural laws and you can't go to find
and<00:01:59.280> after<00:01:59.520> all<00:01:59.759> one<00:02:00.149> time<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.810> that's<00:02:01.320> it<00:02:01.560> it

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
and after all one time and that's it it

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.969 
and after all one time and that's it it
doesn't<00:02:02.430> work<00:02:02.969> that<00:02:03.000> way<00:02:03.680> that<00:02:04.680> would<00:02:04.799> be<00:02:04.950> a

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
doesn't work that way that would be a

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.330 
doesn't work that way that would be a
miracle<00:02:05.820> and

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
miracle and

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.540 
miracle and
yeah<00:02:08.410> the<00:02:09.410> other<00:02:09.530> problem<00:02:09.709> with<00:02:10.009> the<00:02:10.129> myth<00:02:10.340> is

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
yeah the other problem with the myth is

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.320 
yeah the other problem with the myth is
if<00:02:11.420> you<00:02:11.870> look<00:02:12.230> at<00:02:12.560> what<00:02:12.830> crucifixion<00:02:13.430> is<00:02:13.640> it's

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
if you look at what crucifixion is it's

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.410 
if you look at what crucifixion is it's
pretty<00:02:14.599> impossible<00:02:14.900> to<00:02:15.230> die<00:02:15.410> in<00:02:15.590> three<00:02:15.800> days

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
pretty impossible to die in three days

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.030 
pretty impossible to die in three days
the<00:02:17.420> only<00:02:17.959> way<00:02:18.140> someone<00:02:18.200> could<00:02:18.590> die<00:02:18.739> in<00:02:18.980> a

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
the only way someone could die in a

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.740 
the only way someone could die in a
crucifixion<00:02:19.430> in<00:02:19.700> three<00:02:19.879> days<00:02:20.060> is<00:02:20.390> if<00:02:20.599> their

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
crucifixion in three days is if their

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.449 
crucifixion in three days is if their

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
legs are broken at which point they

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.130 
legs are broken at which point they
would<00:02:22.550> no<00:02:22.700> longer<00:02:22.879> be<00:02:23.090> able<00:02:23.390> to<00:02:23.510> support<00:02:23.870> their

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.050

upper<00:02:24.379> torso<00:02:24.799> and<00:02:25.160> they<00:02:25.400> would<00:02:25.549> suffocate<00:02:25.879> to

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
upper torso and they would suffocate to

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.570 
upper torso and they would suffocate to
death<00:02:26.590> but<00:02:27.590> that's<00:02:27.799> not<00:02:27.950> part<00:02:28.190> of<00:02:28.220> the<00:02:28.310> story

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
death but that's not part of the story

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.949 
death but that's not part of the story
hmm<00:02:29.510> so<00:02:29.980> the<00:02:30.980> story<00:02:31.250> just<00:02:31.370> totally<00:02:31.910> fails<00:02:32.150> with

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
hmm so the story just totally fails with

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.270 
hmm so the story just totally fails with
any<00:02:33.530> knowledge<00:02:34.040> of<00:02:34.870> Medicine<00:02:35.870> of<00:02:36.280> human

anatomy and the way the body works you
can<00:02:40.430> understand<00:02:40.849> very<00:02:41.060> quickly<00:02:41.239> that<00:02:41.630> it's

can understand very quickly that it's

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.830 
can understand very quickly that it's
just<00:02:42.140> a<00:02:42.349> zombie<00:02:43.810> mythology<00:02:44.810> story<00:02:46.450> so<00:02:47.450> why<00:02:47.630> did

cultures<00:03:12.680> egg<00:03:12.980> dyeing<00:03:13.250> like<00:03:13.579> the<00:03:13.700> Ukrainian

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
cultures egg dyeing like the Ukrainian

cultures egg dyeing like the Ukrainian
people<00:03:14.239> do<00:03:14.630> kind<00:03:14.840> of<00:03:14.930> an<00:03:15.019> interesting<00:03:15.200> thing

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.629 
we can kind of cut the eggs open make
little<00:03:19.940> hinges<00:03:20.269> and<00:03:21.069> so<00:03:22.069> there's<00:03:22.250> lots<00:03:22.370> of

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:22.639 
little hinges and so there's lots of

little different things you could do

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:26.920 
little different things you could do
with<00:03:24.470> egg<00:03:24.799> dines<00:03:25.099> for<00:03:25.549> creative<00:03:26.090> and<00:03:26.450> sting

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.960 
with egg dines for creative and sting
and<00:03:27.440> you<00:03:27.769> could<00:03:27.920> use<00:03:28.069> it<00:03:28.220> as<00:03:28.430> a<00:03:28.459> way<00:03:28.670> to<00:03:28.700> educate

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
and you could use it as a way to educate

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.210 
and you could use it as a way to educate
your<00:03:29.359> children<00:03:29.599> about<00:03:29.989> other<00:03:30.440> cultures<00:03:30.650> other
