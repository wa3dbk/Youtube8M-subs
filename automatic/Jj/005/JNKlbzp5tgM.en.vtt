here and now it's just a quick video to

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.019 
here and now it's just a quick video to
demonstrate<00:00:19.220> after<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.369> medications<00:00:20.910> I've

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
demonstrate after the medications I've

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.519 
demonstrate after the medications I've
had<00:00:21.150> about<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.480> specs<00:00:21.689> of<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.930> GTO<00:00:22.260> that<00:00:22.470> i'm

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
had about the specs of the GTO that i'm

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.320 
had about the specs of the GTO that i'm
using<00:00:22.560> in<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:23.010> tutorial<00:00:23.430> on<00:00:23.789> how<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:24.060> make<00:00:24.210> a

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
using in the tutorial on how to make a

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.380 
using in the tutorial on how to make a
lot<00:00:24.510> of<00:00:24.570> money<00:00:25.550> 3<00:00:26.550> million<00:00:26.820> in<00:00:26.939> under<00:00:27.210> 10

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
lot of money 3 million in under 10

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.600 
lot of money 3 million in under 10
minutes<00:00:30.830> basically<00:00:31.830> I<00:00:31.859> don't<00:00:32.279> want<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.489> like

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
minutes basically I don't want to like

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.979 
minutes basically I don't want to like
destroy<00:00:33.000> anyone's<00:00:33.270> dreams<00:00:33.510> or<00:00:33.630> whatever<00:00:33.840> but

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
destroy anyone's dreams or whatever but

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.889 
destroy anyone's dreams or whatever but
like<00:00:34.130> the<00:00:35.130> GTR<00:00:35.550> i'm<00:00:35.640> using<00:00:35.969> is<00:00:36.239> very<00:00:37.140> very<00:00:37.320> much

00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:38.899 
like the GTR i'm using is very very much

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:41.750 
like the GTR i'm using is very very much
not<00:00:39.899> very<00:00:40.200> well<00:00:40.440> tuned<00:00:41.070> at<00:00:41.219> always<00:00:41.520> just

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
not very well tuned at always just

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.610 
not very well tuned at always just
there's<00:00:42.149> hardly<00:00:42.989> anything<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.410> it<00:00:45.469> Jack<00:00:46.469> of

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
there's hardly anything to it Jack of

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.779 
there's hardly anything to it Jack of
bandits<00:00:47.010> isn't<00:00:47.280> Holland<00:00:47.579> line<00:00:48.350> so<00:00:49.550> for<00:00:50.550> start

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
bandits isn't Holland line so for start

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.610 
bandits isn't Holland line so for start
as<00:00:51.030> you<00:00:51.600> can<00:00:51.719> see<00:00:51.840> from<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.140> right<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.530> the

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
as you can see from the right of the

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.479 
as you can see from the right of the
chart<00:00:53.360> i'm<00:00:54.360> using<00:00:54.660> sports<00:00:55.590> hard<00:00:55.860> on<00:00:56.070> both<00:00:56.340> the

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
chart i'm using sports hard on both the

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.830 
chart i'm using sports hard on both the
front<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.789> back<00:00:56.879> because<00:00:57.510> that<00:00:57.690> is<00:00:57.780> the

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
front and back because that is the

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.420 
front and back because that is the
maximum<00:00:57.989> tire<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.620> adds<00:00:58.739> use<00:00:58.920> on<00:00:59.039> that<00:00:59.070> event

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
maximum tire and adds use on that event

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.990 
maximum tire and adds use on that event
that's<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.670> four-wheel<00:01:00.059> drive<00:01:00.329> I<00:01:01.399> think<00:01:02.399> 550

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
that's the four-wheel drive I think 550

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
that's the four-wheel drive I think 550
PP<00:01:04.040> event<00:01:05.040> 554<00:01:05.790> I<00:01:05.939> commander<00:01:06.420> I<00:01:06.659> can't<00:01:06.930> even

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
PP event 554 I commander I can't even

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.370 
PP event 554 I commander I can't even
remember<00:01:07.260> without<00:01:07.530> looking<00:01:07.830> at<00:01:07.890> it<00:01:09.170> Jesus<00:01:10.170> not

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
remember without looking at it Jesus not

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.539 
remember without looking at it Jesus not

today<00:01:11.760> um<00:01:12.600> I<00:01:13.490> have<00:01:14.490> stage<00:01:14.760> 3<00:01:14.880> weight<00:01:15.450> reduction

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
today um I have stage 3 weight reduction

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.590 
today um I have stage 3 weight reduction
that's<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.860> must<00:01:17.070> for<00:01:17.430> them<00:01:17.520> for<00:01:17.790> myself<00:01:17.939> that's

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
that's a must for them for myself that's

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.760 
that's a must for them for myself that's
just<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.810> way<00:01:18.900> I<00:01:18.930> like<00:01:19.110> it<00:01:19.170> I<00:01:19.409> like<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.680> way

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
just the way I like it I like the way

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.910 
just the way I like it I like the way
the<00:01:19.979> cars<00:01:20.189> respond<00:01:20.610> when<00:01:20.880> they<00:01:21.030> are<00:01:21.210> lighter

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
the cars respond when they are lighter

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.080 
the cars respond when they are lighter
window<00:01:22.920> weight<00:01:23.100> reduction<00:01:23.460> rigidity

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
window weight reduction rigidity

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.399 
window weight reduction rigidity
improvement<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:24.930> no<00:01:25.799> ballast<00:01:26.220> whatsoever<00:01:27.409> ok

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
improvement and no ballast whatsoever ok

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.350 
improvement and no ballast whatsoever ok
nothing<00:01:28.710> there<00:01:29.310> was<00:01:29.369> nothing<00:01:29.430> there<00:01:29.850> ok<00:01:30.299> so

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
nothing there was nothing there ok so

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.760 
nothing there was nothing there ok so
that's<00:01:30.659> just<00:01:30.869> all<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.049> basic<00:01:31.380> body<00:01:31.590> and

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
that's just all the basic body and

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.310 
that's just all the basic body and
chassis<00:01:31.799> were<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:32.729> can<00:01:32.880> get<00:01:33.000> done<00:01:33.170> onto<00:01:34.170> the

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
chassis were you can get done onto the

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.960 
chassis were you can get done onto the
engine<00:01:35.689> standard<00:01:36.689> ECU<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.610> the<00:01:38.610> power<00:01:38.820> is

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
engine standard ECU and the power is

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.270 
engine standard ECU and the power is
limited<00:01:39.619> seventy<00:01:40.619> two<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:40.950> half<00:01:41.130> percent

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
limited seventy two and a half percent

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.880 
limited seventy two and a half percent
and<00:01:41.840> that's<00:01:42.840> just<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.140> latest<00:01:43.320> one<00:01:43.619> I've<00:01:43.740> done

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
and that's just the latest one I've done

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.609 
and that's just the latest one I've done
I<00:01:43.920> think<00:01:44.040> it<00:01:44.220> was<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.340> bit<00:01:44.460> higher<00:01:44.729> in<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.030> video

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
I think it was a bit higher in the video

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:47.749 
I think it was a bit higher in the video
the<00:01:46.619> performance<00:01:47.009> was<00:01:47.100> in<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.310> video<00:01:47.430> about

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
the performance was in the video about

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.330 
the performance was in the video about
396<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.810> think<00:01:48.990> so<00:01:49.170> I've<00:01:49.710> taken<00:01:49.890> it<00:01:50.009> down<00:01:50.070> and

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
396 I think so I've taken it down and

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.969 
396 I think so I've taken it down and
refined<00:01:50.610> a<00:01:50.729> bit<00:01:50.850> more<00:01:51.000> since<00:01:51.780> then<00:01:51.960> but<00:01:52.229> by<00:01:52.920> the

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
refined a bit more since then but by the

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.219 
refined a bit more since then but by the
way<00:01:53.570> so<00:01:54.570> you<00:01:54.659> can<00:01:54.780> see<00:01:54.899> I<00:01:54.930> haven't<00:01:55.110> done

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
way so you can see I haven't done

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.660 
way so you can see I haven't done
anything<00:01:55.290> here<00:01:55.740> either<00:01:55.770> that's<00:01:56.219> all<00:01:56.340> except<00:01:56.640> a

anything here either that's all except a

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.450 
anything here either that's all except a
limited<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.119> power<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.540> 70<00:01:57.869> 2.5%<00:01:58.469> you<00:01:59.310> can

limited the power to 70 2.5% you can

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.670 
limited the power to 70 2.5% you can
limit<00:01:59.549> as<00:01:59.759> much<00:02:00.000> as<00:02:00.149> you<00:02:00.240> want<00:02:00.479> but<00:02:01.200> your

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
limit as much as you want but your

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.929

everything there was nothing else this

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.860 
everything there was nothing else this
is<00:04:53.060> the<00:04:53.240> way<00:04:53.360> that<00:04:53.510> I<00:04:53.600> win<00:04:53.780> the<00:04:53.900> races<00:04:54.080> and<00:04:54.380> you

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:04.480 
the only reason I'm not going to redo
the<00:05:03.229> race<00:05:03.350> now<00:05:03.560> is<00:05:03.590> because<00:05:03.950> it<00:05:04.190> takes<00:05:04.340> ages

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490
