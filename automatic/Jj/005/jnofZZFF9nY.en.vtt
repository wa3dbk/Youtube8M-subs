00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.920 
to go similar i personally don't earn
the<00:02:53.430> nails<00:02:53.579> either<00:02:53.790> brush<00:02:54.030> so<00:02:54.239> i<00:02:54.269> can't<00:02:54.569> make<00:02:54.900> a

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
the nails either brush so i can't make a

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.100 
the nails either brush so i can't make a
comparison<00:02:55.349> but<00:02:55.849> nearly<00:02:56.989> everything<00:02:57.989> that

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
comparison but nearly everything that

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.390 
comparison but nearly everything that
I've<00:02:58.200> seen<00:02:58.349> is<00:02:58.500> said<00:02:58.680> that<00:02:58.709> it's<00:02:58.950> the<00:02:59.040> closest

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
I've seen is said that it's the closest

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.250 
I've seen is said that it's the closest
thing that<00:02:59.549> you<00:02:59.670> can<00:02:59.880> get<00:03:00.060> to<00:03:00.360> a<00:03:00.390> doob<00:03:00.810> for<00:03:01.110> the

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
thing that you can get to a doob for the

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.050 
thing that you can get to a doob for the
NARS<00:03:01.440> eater<00:03:01.680> brush<00:03:01.890> so<00:03:02.220> and<00:03:02.549> apparently<00:03:02.970> it's

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
little sample pack like this because I

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.120 
little sample pack like this because I
haven't<00:03:45.120> bought<00:03:45.420> a<00:03:45.630> full-size<00:03:46.380> yet<00:03:46.650> but<00:03:47.040> is

the Estee Lauder advanced night repair I

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.110 
the Estee Lauder advanced night repair I
almost<00:03:49.980> wish<00:03:50.220> that<00:03:50.250> this<00:03:50.489> stuff<00:03:50.730> didn't<00:03:51.060> work

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
almost wish that this stuff didn't work

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.750 
almost wish that this stuff didn't work
because<00:03:51.599> it<00:03:52.019> costs<00:03:52.319> so<00:03:52.560> much<00:03:52.590> to<00:03:52.829> buy<00:03:53.130> I<00:03:53.370> went

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
because it costs so much to buy I went

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.069 
because it costs so much to buy I went
to<00:03:53.849> the<00:03:53.940> estee<00:03:54.180> lauder<00:03:54.359> counter<00:03:54.540> and<00:03:54.900> asked

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
to the estee lauder counter and asked

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:56.629 
to the estee lauder counter and asked
the<00:03:55.230> girl<00:03:55.380> there<00:03:55.590> which<00:03:55.950> serum<00:03:56.340> she<00:03:56.459> thought

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:56.639 
the girl there which serum she thought

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:58.220 
the girl there which serum she thought
be<00:03:56.790> good<00:03:56.970> for<00:03:57.120> my<00:03:57.209> type<00:03:57.419> of<00:03:57.450> skin<00:03:57.810> because<00:03:58.139> I

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
be good for my type of skin because I

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:59.930 
be good for my type of skin because I
have<00:03:58.410> a<00:03:58.620> little<00:03:58.919> bit<00:03:59.099> of<00:03:59.130> acne<00:03:59.430> scarring<00:03:59.760> and

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
have a little bit of acne scarring and

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.159 
have a little bit of acne scarring and
she<00:04:00.120> told<00:04:00.299> me<00:04:00.359> that<00:04:00.510> this<00:04:00.599> won't<00:04:00.750> be<00:04:00.930> great

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:01.169 
she told me that this won't be great

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:02.930 
she told me that this won't be great
because<00:04:01.319> it<00:04:01.500> repairs<00:04:01.859> the<00:04:01.980> skin<00:04:02.220> cells<00:04:02.459> so

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
because it repairs the skin cells so

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.069 
because it repairs the skin cells so
I've<00:04:03.000> been<00:04:03.120> trying<00:04:03.389> it<00:04:03.510> out<00:04:03.569> and<00:04:03.870> I<00:04:03.900> could

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
I've been trying it out and I could

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:05.659 
I've been trying it out and I could
notice<00:04:04.349> results<00:04:04.739> pretty<00:04:05.160> much<00:04:05.430> from<00:04:05.609> the

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:05.669 
notice results pretty much from the

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:07.909 
notice results pretty much from the
first<00:04:05.940> use<00:04:06.209> so<00:04:06.540> this<00:04:07.109> stuff<00:04:07.319> actually<00:04:07.530> works

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:07.919 
first use so this stuff actually works

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:09.770 
first use so this stuff actually works
really<00:04:08.069> really<00:04:08.280> well<00:04:08.489> I'm<00:04:09.269> not<00:04:09.510> that<00:04:09.690> excited

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
really really well I'm not that excited

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.120 
really really well I'm not that excited
to<00:04:10.139> go<00:04:10.230> out<00:04:10.260> and<00:04:10.530> spend<00:04:10.650> one<00:04:10.799> hundred<00:04:11.040> and

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
to go out and spend one hundred and

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:12.770 
to go out and spend one hundred and
forty<00:04:11.370> dollars<00:04:11.669> on<00:04:11.880> at<00:04:12.030> the<00:04:12.120> full<00:04:12.329> size<00:04:12.569> of

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
forty dollars on at the full size of

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.199 
forty dollars on at the full size of
this<00:04:12.870> but<00:04:13.560> it<00:04:14.040> works<00:04:14.280> amazingly<00:04:14.700> so<00:04:15.030> it<00:04:15.090> will

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
this but it works amazingly so it will

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:15.860 
this but it works amazingly so it will
probably<00:04:15.389> be<00:04:15.509> worth

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
probably be worth

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.420 
probably be worth
