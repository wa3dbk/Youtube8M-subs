the main purpose of the touchscreen

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.820 
the main purpose of the touchscreen
controller<00:00:12.179> is<00:00:12.599> to<00:00:12.840> manage<00:00:13.170> the<00:00:13.320> sequence<00:00:13.710> of

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
controller is to manage the sequence of

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.740 
controller is to manage the sequence of
temperature<00:00:14.370> and<00:00:14.549> pressure<00:00:14.820> variations<00:00:15.630> that
