00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:05.730
 yes but you like leeuwarden first weeks 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.990
 months are finished how happy you are with the 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.660
 new employer 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.309
 we also fine i must say nice club 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.380
 fun people 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.350
 and we are heading in a good direction again 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.210
 that is also always a pleasant hotel 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.400
 yes can do a lot on the transfer market 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.910
 oh yes also on the transfer market and also 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.140
 out there and yes it's a lively one 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.340
 transfer market 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.900
 , satisfied with the transfer this year 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.149
 now 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.980
 yes so its reasonable tv so both the 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.899
 outgoing if the if the incoming 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.550
 transfer 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.530
 we have we reasonable it quality me 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.739
 can find that we were looking for 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:47.480
 which is very difficult for defenders 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:50.399
 and now see how the puzzle fits 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:53.309
 puzzle pieces are still needed 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.170
 yes we have a handful is necessary and 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.579
 then the most important pieces that still 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.800
 completed modern 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.199
 well, numerical, of course 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.539
 something in the back 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.630
 and further yes i expect them anyway 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.549
 what will be drawn to our players 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.100
 and if they have some gift then you must 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.900
 able to respond adequately 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.760
 yes and who in for example will be drawn 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.049
 could be because they call it all 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.970
 see say if he says I want whole 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.890
 like to stay that is perhaps only whole 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.100
 nice signals for the supporters that I do 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.750
 mentioned I do not see but in principle can 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.619
 drawn one to all players 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.710
 to become 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:31.229
 but yes early for a whole lot 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.270
 players among whom hakim is 2010 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:37.829
 always great platform 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.360
 I think we have also seen the players 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.250
 that we have a very nice would 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.810
 may have next year must have one 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.390
 little bit must be a little bit good 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.070
 I have little luck but I fall 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.759
 think very worthy team for each other 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.439
 can get 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.020
 it is provided for itself already one 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.000
 bit of a place where thoughts can 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.409
 twente own 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.659
 hard to say because you tick 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.280
 but we do n't quite know what's going on yet 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.780
 happens to us and then you can actually 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.969
 also just look at yourself 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.049
 I do n't know what to do with all clubs 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.740
 happens 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:09.119
 and that of course counts, so beware 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.489
 you can answer in September 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.030
 this question to what extent expectation as 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:16.700
 that many players are leaving 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.530
 add it is it is a weird window 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.830
 So there seems to be an easy question 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:24.470
 I am difficult because it controls processes 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.500
 yourself not the first buyer and 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.190
 then the player and then yourself with 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.170
 your asking price 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.990
 so hard to say but i'm guessing 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:36.050
 you have to do three 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:40.280
 and with then about yes basic forces of 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:43.670
 last season can not answer 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:46.550
 that that lies with others is now there 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.200
 concrete or interest in players 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.000
 yes the city a number of nature players 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.910
 permanently in the attention of other clubs 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.400
 and then it is often waiting for or the bee 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.750
 the club's what happens before they take action 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.940
 to undertake 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.850
 names like cabral and fernandez were then 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.840
 mentioned a lot that may leave fc 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.080
 twente 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:09.350
 to what extent they are already on the nomination to op 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.450
 short term they would leave it 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.040
 Answer that there we can't 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.020
 answer 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.800
 their future employers if already there 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.930
 to be 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.830
 they can never answer that 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.080
 boring there such a day 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.540
 I can also here everywhere already 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.430
 anyway yes and i also read one like that 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.650
 telephone companies do by good 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.700
 Case nowadays only have 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.170
 a Belgian how does such a thought out 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.780
 take is seagull gets up like today 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.610
 here on the Rhine and then yes and then look 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.209
 you are the robots sit on your phone 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.020
 apps 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:41.209
 calling messages in nou usually starts 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.310
 from 6 pm 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:45.230
 then europe is walkin here let's 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.910
 wake up the england and then 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.040
 and so it ripples for the evening 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.610
 in the middle of the day it breaks down in 's 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.010
 evening 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:55.340
 it gets another flight its clips 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.780
 his agent is his agent 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.400
 anything and everything 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.110
 with you for example abroad 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.150
 that she is at FC Twente 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.370
 now have to tighten the belt and that she 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.590
 weirdly shy for money 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.690
 well it is the situation of twente 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.090
 well-known info high on a twente itself 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:14.510
 It is also known that brand I can also watch 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:16.730
 Tuomas secretly to other players who 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:19.049
 this way must come that twente good 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:20.400
 everyone knows the name of twente 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.860
 Everyone also knows the good ones 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.840
 springboard is a good club 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.840
 a nice stadium is a good fans and 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:30.300
 so twente is well known 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.289
 and the situation at tent has of course 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.360
 also talked around 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:35.789
 that can't be it it was one 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.419
 major operation to get money inside 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:40.139
 to get 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:42.449
 so only yes now we need them all 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:44.669
 again understand that we meanwhile 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:46.800
 approximately achieved the goal and not 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:49.409
 against any reasonable offer 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.000
 you have to let a player go 

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:52.979
 then one for example 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.740
 yes Greek defense over the line or 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:57.419
 a defender of napoli 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.300
 yes well yes if you know a few people 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:01.680
 then there can sometimes be a network 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.379
 build up 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.969
 yes networking good and good player is one 

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:08.009
 good play and I think this before 

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:10.289
 the netherlands good defense 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:12.539
 Netherlands is was difficult 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:14.729
 And these guys would also be motivated 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:18.000
 and if you can already explain project 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:20.390
 you can show the stadium well then 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.680
 there what can a 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:24.040
 dries mertens is of course a bit 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:26.450
 hope she helps things run out of you 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.440
 to what extent is it still important 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:30.440
 a rush comes or is 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:32.750
 Corona might be the surprise 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:35.090
 central to that place 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.010
 yes we will all see that and there 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.610
 is still a number of options and jari 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:40.640
 oostwijk 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:42.500
 which is good for development so 

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:45.050
 will look how it 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:47.510
 how windows develops there that 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.590
 there is still a missed interview 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.330
 that we are still just able to take 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:53.210
 no i have my phone dial 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:54.740
 who would be laid down in diet day then 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:57.970
 is not disturbed by the interview 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:57.970
 very neat and well
