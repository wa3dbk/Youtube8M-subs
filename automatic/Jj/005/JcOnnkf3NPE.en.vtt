what the silver shatter looks like on

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.719 
what the silver shatter looks like on
top<00:01:19.890> this<00:01:20.580> is<00:01:20.820> over<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.710> red<00:01:22.710> this<00:01:23.189> is<00:01:23.369> over<00:01:23.610> an

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
top this is over a red this is over an

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.070 
top this is over a red this is over an
orange<00:01:24.150> just<00:01:25.110> all<00:01:25.380> cream<00:01:25.890> colors<00:01:27.049> over<00:01:28.049> a

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
orange just all cream colors over a

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.469 
orange just all cream colors over a
yellow<00:01:28.380> I<00:01:28.890> feel<00:01:29.520> like<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:29.820> looks<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.299> best

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
yellow I feel like it looks the best

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.460 
yellow I feel like it looks the best
over<00:01:31.040> yellow<00:01:32.040> but<00:01:32.549> that's<00:01:32.970> just<00:01:33.150> my<00:01:33.329> opinion

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
over yellow but that's just my opinion

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.760 
over yellow but that's just my opinion
it's<00:01:34.470> like<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.740> light<00:01:35.100> green<00:01:35.930> turquoise<00:01:36.930> a

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
it's like a light green turquoise a

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:45.499 
it's like a light green turquoise a
light<00:01:38.070> blue<00:01:38.990> medium<00:01:39.990> blue<00:01:40.790> purple<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:42.920> pink<00:01:44.509> see

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
light blue medium blue purple a pink see

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.359 
light blue medium blue purple a pink see
if<00:01:45.600> I<00:01:45.720> can<00:01:45.899> focus<00:01:46.320> that<00:01:46.710> one<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:46.950> little<00:01:47.130> bit

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
if I can focus that one a little bit

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:53.289 
if I can focus that one a little bit
better<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:49.189> light<00:01:50.189> pink<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.880> white<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:52.220> a<00:01:53.220> black

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
better a light pink a white and a black

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:56.420 
better a light pink a white and a black
so<00:01:54.299> I<00:01:54.329> definitely<00:01:54.899> I<00:01:55.290> feel<00:01:55.439> like<00:01:55.799> it<00:01:56.040> looks<00:01:56.189> the

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
so I definitely I feel like it looks the

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.120 
so I definitely I feel like it looks the
best<00:01:56.610> over<00:01:57.090> yellow<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:58.140> yellow<00:01:58.170> pops<00:01:58.710> through

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
best over yellow the yellow pops through

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.280 
best over yellow the yellow pops through
a<00:01:59.280> lot<00:01:59.700> better<00:01:59.939> than<00:02:00.240> some<00:02:00.930> of<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.110> other

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
a lot better than some of the other

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.609 
a lot better than some of the other
colors<00:02:01.680> but<00:02:02.570> again<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:03.780> kind<00:02:03.930> of<00:02:04.049> just<00:02:04.229> depends

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
colors but again it kind of just depends

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.069 
colors but again it kind of just depends
on<00:02:04.740> what<00:02:04.979> you<00:02:05.159> like<00:02:05.509> when<00:02:06.509> I<00:02:06.540> get<00:02:06.719> my<00:02:06.840> computer

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
on what you like when I get my computer

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.139 
on what you like when I get my computer
back<00:02:07.350> i'll<00:02:07.770> be<00:02:07.920> posting<00:02:08.099> pictures<00:02:08.580> of<00:02:08.729> this<00:02:08.970> in

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
back i'll be posting pictures of this in

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.330 
back i'll be posting pictures of this in
my<00:02:09.330> blog<00:02:09.599> up<00:02:09.929> close<00:02:10.229> picture<00:02:10.649> so<00:02:10.860> you<00:02:10.890> guys<00:02:11.129> can

my blog up close picture so you guys can

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.120 
my blog up close picture so you guys can
see<00:02:11.400> them<00:02:11.790> a<00:02:11.819> lot<00:02:12.060> better<00:02:12.270> but

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
see them a lot better but

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.540 
see them a lot better but
that's<00:02:13.250> just<00:02:13.460> a<00:02:13.790> brief<00:02:14.740> view<00:02:15.740> of<00:02:16.070> what<00:02:16.400> they

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
that's just a brief view of what they

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.300 
that's just a brief view of what they
look<00:02:16.730> like<00:02:16.790> over<00:02:17.210> cream<00:02:17.660> colors<00:02:18.020> first<00:02:18.560> so

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
look like over cream colors first so

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.940 
look like over cream colors first so
really<00:02:19.730> quickly<00:02:20.030> before<00:02:20.330> I<00:02:20.570> start<00:02:21.140> this<00:02:21.380> demo

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
really quickly before I start this demo

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.950 
really quickly before I start this demo
I'll<00:02:22.220> just<00:02:22.430> show<00:02:22.640> you<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:22.910> swatches<00:02:23.210> of<00:02:23.450> what

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960 
I'll just show you the swatches of what

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.610 
I'll just show you the swatches of what
the<00:02:24.640> serena<00:02:25.640> polishes<00:02:26.060> look<00:02:26.270> like<00:02:26.480> this<00:02:27.380> one

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
the serena polishes look like this one

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.460 
the serena polishes look like this one
right<00:02:27.800> here<00:02:27.860> is<00:02:28.250> from<00:02:28.910> the<00:02:28.970> spark<00:02:29.930> de<00:02:30.050> triomphe

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
right here is from the spark de triomphe

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.710 
right here is from the spark de triomphe
duo<00:02:31.190> and<00:02:31.610> it's<00:02:31.730> called<00:02:31.970> spark<00:02:32.270> de<00:02:32.360> triomphe

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
duo and it's called spark de triomphe

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.320 
duo and it's called spark de triomphe
obviously<00:02:33.290> and<00:02:33.530> this<00:02:34.100> is<00:02:34.310> what<00:02:34.520> the<00:02:34.850> Polish

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
obviously and this is what the Polish

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.520 
obviously and this is what the Polish
looks<00:02:35.720> like<00:02:36.730> in<00:02:37.730> the<00:02:37.970> bottle<00:02:38.360> let's<00:02:39.170> see<00:02:39.320> if<00:02:39.440> I

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
looks like in the bottle let's see if I

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.450 
looks like in the bottle let's see if I
can<00:02:39.560> focus<00:02:40.280> on<00:02:40.760> the<00:02:40.970> bottle<00:02:41.330> and<00:02:42.110> not<00:02:42.440> make<00:02:43.310> it

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:43.460 
can focus on the bottle and not make it

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.700 
can focus on the bottle and not make it
really<00:02:43.670> blurry<00:02:44.080> so<00:02:45.080> it's<00:02:45.200> just<00:02:45.290> a<00:02:45.470> really

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710 
really blurry so it's just a really

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:52.200 
really blurry so it's just a really
really<00:02:45.980> shimmery<00:02:46.400> white<00:02:46.880> gold<00:02:47.680> nail<00:02:48.680> polish<00:02:49.130> I

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.360 

don't<00:02:53.210> know<00:02:53.320> it's<00:02:54.320> probably<00:02:54.410> harder<00:02:55.040> to<00:02:55.160> see

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
don't know it's probably harder to see

looks like right there so yeah I am just
going<00:03:28.820> to<00:03:28.940> do<00:03:29.870> the<00:03:30.440> shatters<00:03:31.430> that<00:03:31.550> they<00:03:31.670> came

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
going to do the shatters that they came

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.330 
going to do the shatters that they came
with<00:03:32.090> over<00:03:33.020> these<00:03:33.230> two<00:03:33.470> colors<00:03:33.710> so<00:03:34.070> you<00:03:34.100> guys

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
with over these two colors so you guys

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.300 
with over these two colors so you guys
can<00:03:34.520> see<00:03:34.730> a<00:03:35.540> spark<00:03:36.020> de<00:03:36.200> Triomphe<00:03:36.590> came<00:03:36.860> with

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
can see a spark de Triomphe came with

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.090 
can see a spark de Triomphe came with
the<00:03:37.670> white<00:03:38.330> shatter<00:03:38.810> this<00:03:39.560> is<00:03:39.710> what<00:03:39.860> the<00:03:39.980> white

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
the white shatter this is what the white

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.610 
the white shatter this is what the white
shattered<00:03:40.460> it<00:03:40.580> looks<00:03:40.700> like<00:03:41.200> with<00:03:42.200> the<00:03:42.350> shatter

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
shattered it looks like with the shatter

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.410 
shattered it looks like with the shatter
pattern<00:03:43.130> right<00:03:43.340> there<00:03:43.550> and<00:03:43.940> it<00:03:44.000> just<00:03:44.240> looks

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
pattern right there and it just looks

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.690 
pattern right there and it just looks
like<00:03:44.540> a<00:03:44.570> white<00:03:44.810> nail<00:03:45.020> polish<00:03:45.260> so<00:03:45.800> I'll<00:03:46.370> start

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
like a white nail polish so I'll start

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.000 
like a white nail polish so I'll start
with<00:03:46.850> that<00:03:47.060> over<00:03:47.510> sparked<00:03:48.290> a<00:03:48.380> tree<00:03:48.590> on<00:03:48.709> which

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
with that over sparked a tree on which

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:54.370 
with that over sparked a tree on which
is<00:03:49.190> a<00:03:49.220> band<00:03:49.459> right<00:03:49.550> there<00:03:52.720> if<00:03:53.720> you<00:03:53.900> hear<00:03:54.140> noise

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
is a band right there if you hear noise

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.080 
is a band right there if you hear noise
in<00:03:54.590> the<00:03:54.650> background<00:03:54.830> that's<00:03:55.430> a<00:03:55.580> hockey<00:03:55.820> game

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
in the background that's a hockey game

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.980 
in the background that's a hockey game
going<00:03:56.510> on<00:03:56.690> I<00:03:57.050> know<00:03:57.170> you<00:03:57.590> guys<00:03:58.010> hate<00:03:58.370> that<00:03:58.610> but

00:03:58.980 --> 00:03:58.990 
going on I know you guys hate that but

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:05.020 
going on I know you guys hate that but
that's<00:03:59.990> just<00:04:00.110> what's<00:04:00.500> gonna<00:04:00.650> happen<00:04:04.030> so

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
that's just what's gonna happen so

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.390 
that's just what's gonna happen so
there's<00:04:05.240> a<00:04:05.300> nice<00:04:05.510> thick<00:04:05.900> coat<00:04:06.260> of<00:04:06.290> the<00:04:06.860> white

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
there's a nice thick coat of the white

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.900 
there's a nice thick coat of the white
shatter<00:04:07.850> on<00:04:08.180> top<00:04:08.930> of<00:04:09.110> spark<00:04:09.440> de<00:04:09.590> Triomphe

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
shatter on top of spark de Triomphe

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:12.940 
shatter on top of spark de Triomphe
and<00:04:11.540> while<00:04:11.720> that's<00:04:11.840> drying<00:04:12.110> I'm<00:04:12.620> going<00:04:12.740> to<00:04:12.800> go

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
and while that's drying I'm going to go

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.330 
and while that's drying I'm going to go
ahead<00:04:12.980> and<00:04:13.250> go<00:04:13.700> in<00:04:13.880> with<00:04:14.300> some<00:04:14.920> red<00:04:15.920> shatter

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
ahead and go in with some red shatter

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.050 
ahead and go in with some red shatter
which<00:04:16.940> looks<00:04:17.150> like<00:04:17.300> that<00:04:18.340> and<00:04:19.340> I'm<00:04:19.880> going<00:04:20.030> to

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
which looks like that and I'm going to

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:35.080 
which looks like that and I'm going to
put<00:04:20.299> it<00:04:20.420> over<00:04:20.630> the<00:04:21.170> rally<00:04:21.590> pretty<00:04:22.130> pink

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.480 

so<00:04:36.090> that<00:04:36.240> was<00:04:36.420> a<00:04:36.450> pretty<00:04:37.260> decent<00:04:37.980> amount<00:04:38.340> of

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
so that was a pretty decent amount of

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.660 
so that was a pretty decent amount of
polish<00:04:38.850> on<00:04:39.060> there<00:04:39.980> and<00:04:40.980> now<00:04:41.160> we<00:04:41.220> just<00:04:41.430> wait<00:04:41.610> for

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:41.670 
polish on there and now we just wait for

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:45.350 
polish on there and now we just wait for
it<00:04:41.910> to<00:04:41.970> dry<00:04:42.030> I<00:04:43.130> will<00:04:44.130> do<00:04:44.310> it<00:04:44.430> over<00:04:44.760> some<00:04:45.060> black

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
it to dry I will do it over some black

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.780 
it to dry I will do it over some black
as<00:04:45.780> you<00:04:46.050> can<00:04:46.170> see<00:04:46.350> there<00:04:46.530> and<00:04:46.770> some<00:04:46.980> white<00:04:47.220> nail

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
as you can see there and some white nail

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:52.730 
as you can see there and some white nail
polish<00:04:48.000> as<00:04:48.390> well<00:04:49.580> so<00:04:50.580> you<00:04:50.640> guys<00:04:50.850> can<00:04:51.090> see<00:04:51.740> what

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
polish as well so you guys can see what

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.100 
polish as well so you guys can see what
the<00:04:53.340> red<00:04:53.580> looks<00:04:53.790> like<00:04:54.030> over<00:04:54.360> the<00:04:54.600> black<00:04:54.960> and

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
the red looks like over the black and

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.020 
the red looks like over the black and
white<00:04:55.290> and<00:04:55.470> what<00:04:55.680> the<00:04:55.920> white<00:04:56.490> looks<00:04:56.730> like<00:04:56.880> over

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
white and what the white looks like over

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:09.409 
white and what the white looks like over
the<00:04:57.180> black<00:05:05.270> so<00:05:06.270> with<00:05:07.110> the<00:05:07.440> the<00:05:08.430> two<00:05:08.640> shatters

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:09.419 
the black so with the the two shatters

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:11.420 
the black so with the the two shatters
like<00:05:09.900> the<00:05:10.230> black<00:05:10.440> shatter<00:05:10.770> and<00:05:11.040> the<00:05:11.160> silver

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
like the black shatter and the silver

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.670 
like the black shatter and the silver
shatter<00:05:11.790> if<00:05:12.450> you<00:05:12.540> put<00:05:12.720> a<00:05:12.750> top<00:05:13.020> coat<00:05:13.290> over<00:05:13.650> it

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
shatter if you put a top coat over it

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.490 
shatter if you put a top coat over it
it'll<00:05:14.220> look<00:05:15.210> more<00:05:15.540> glossy<00:05:15.840> than<00:05:16.260> it<00:05:16.350> does

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
it'll look more glossy than it does

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.890 
it'll look more glossy than it does
right<00:05:16.530> now<00:05:16.710> especially<00:05:17.370> the<00:05:17.970> red<00:05:18.210> it<00:05:18.540> doesn't

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
right now especially the red it doesn't

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.030 
right now especially the red it doesn't
look<00:05:19.050> as<00:05:19.290> shiny<00:05:19.680> as<00:05:19.800> it<00:05:20.100> could<00:05:20.840> so<00:05:21.840> if<00:05:22.680> you<00:05:22.860> put

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:23.040 
look as shiny as it could so if you put

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.710 
look as shiny as it could so if you put
a<00:05:23.070> top<00:05:23.280> coat<00:05:23.520> over<00:05:23.760> it<00:05:23.790> it'll<00:05:24.120> look<00:05:24.240> a<00:05:24.419> little

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 
a top coat over it it'll look a little

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.340 
a top coat over it it'll look a little
bit<00:05:24.990> better<00:05:26.570> these<00:05:27.570> two<00:05:27.810> look<00:05:27.840> like<00:05:28.169> they're

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:28.350 
bit better these two look like they're

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.860 
bit better these two look like they're
pretty<00:05:28.680> much<00:05:28.860> done<00:05:29.160> shattering<00:05:29.940> so<00:05:30.510> you<00:05:30.630> can

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:30.870 
pretty much done shattering so you can

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.010 
pretty much done shattering so you can
see<00:05:31.050> that<00:05:31.080> the<00:05:31.260> white<00:05:31.530> one<00:05:31.770> I<00:05:32.510> put<00:05:33.510> quite<00:05:33.750> a<00:05:33.810> bit

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
see that the white one I put quite a bit

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.760 
see that the white one I put quite a bit
on<00:05:34.200> there<00:05:34.440> so<00:05:34.740> the<00:05:35.160> shatter<00:05:35.640> isn't<00:05:36.150> as<00:05:36.500> PC<00:05:37.500> as

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 
on there so the shatter isn't as PC as

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.800 
on there so the shatter isn't as PC as
the<00:05:38.160> red<00:05:38.370> one<00:05:38.610> but<00:05:38.880> the<00:05:39.000> red<00:05:39.150> one<00:05:39.360> since<00:05:39.630> it<00:05:39.720> was

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:39.810 
the red one but the red one since it was

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:42.130 
the red one but the red one since it was
a<00:05:39.840> thinner<00:05:40.110> coat<00:05:40.410> you<00:05:41.010> can<00:05:41.160> see<00:05:41.370> that<00:05:41.580> it

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:42.140 
a thinner coat you can see that it

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:45.260 
a thinner coat you can see that it
shattered<00:05:43.140> a<00:05:43.320> little<00:05:43.590> bit<00:05:43.710> better<00:05:44.040> I'll<00:05:44.940> lift

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 
shattered a little bit better I'll lift

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:51.050 
shattered a little bit better I'll lift
that<00:05:45.450> up<00:05:45.510> see<00:05:45.810> you<00:05:45.900> guys<00:05:46.110> gonna<00:05:46.350> see<00:05:46.620> it<00:05:50.060> focus

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 
that up see you guys gonna see it focus

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:56.090 
that up see you guys gonna see it focus
so<00:05:52.050> it's<00:05:52.320> not<00:05:52.500> gonna<00:05:52.650> focus<00:05:54.830> it's<00:05:55.830> not<00:05:55.950> gonna

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:56.100 
so it's not gonna focus it's not gonna

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.760 
so it's not gonna focus it's not gonna
focus<00:05:56.340> anymore<00:05:56.700> than<00:05:57.000> that<00:05:57.030> so<00:05:57.479> I'm<00:05:58.169> sorry<00:05:58.470> but

um<00:05:59.120> we'll<00:06:00.120> just<00:06:00.300> do<00:06:00.510> some<00:06:00.750> white<00:06:00.960> over<00:06:01.320> here<00:06:01.710> on

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:01.890 
um we'll just do some white over here on

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:05.090 
um we'll just do some white over here on
this<00:06:02.400> and<00:06:02.790> some<00:06:03.510> red<00:06:04.200> will<00:06:04.530> go<00:06:04.650> on<00:06:04.800> the<00:06:04.919> other

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:05.100 
this and some red will go on the other

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:10.610 
this and some red will go on the other
side<00:06:05.720> let's<00:06:06.720> just<00:06:06.810> do<00:06:07.110> some<00:06:07.350> white<00:06:07.560> first<00:06:09.620> this

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:10.620 
side let's just do some white first this

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.890 
side let's just do some white first this
is<00:06:10.830> white<00:06:11.070> shatter<00:06:11.400> over<00:06:11.910> just<00:06:12.150> a<00:06:12.300> black<00:06:12.600> nail

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:12.900 
is white shatter over just a black nail

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:18.219 
is white shatter over just a black nail
polish

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:18.229 

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:21.709 

and<00:06:19.229> then<00:06:19.529> I'm<00:06:19.889> going<00:06:20.099> to<00:06:20.129> go<00:06:20.339> over<00:06:20.669> here<00:06:21.509> and

00:06:21.709 --> 00:06:21.719 
and then I'm going to go over here and

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:24.229 
and then I'm going to go over here and
just<00:06:22.409> do<00:06:22.589> some<00:06:22.830> red<00:06:23.039> shatter<00:06:23.339> over<00:06:23.699> black<00:06:23.939> and

00:06:24.229 --> 00:06:24.239 
just do some red shatter over black and

00:06:24.239 --> 00:06:26.719 
just do some red shatter over black and
white<00:06:24.449> while<00:06:25.289> the<00:06:25.529> white<00:06:25.829> is<00:06:26.099> drying<00:06:26.459> on<00:06:26.699> the

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:26.729 
white while the white is drying on the

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:33.530 
white while the white is drying on the
other<00:06:26.939> side

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:33.540 

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:36.500 

so<00:06:34.470> obviously<00:06:35.070> you<00:06:35.310> can<00:06:35.490> see<00:06:35.700> that<00:06:35.940> the<00:06:36.060> red<00:06:36.270> is

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:36.510 
so obviously you can see that the red is

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:38.840 
so obviously you can see that the red is
not<00:06:36.840> a<00:06:36.870> very<00:06:37.350> opaque<00:06:37.830> red<00:06:38.100> it's<00:06:38.400> more<00:06:38.670> of<00:06:38.760> a

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:38.850 
not a very opaque red it's more of a

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:41.300 
not a very opaque red it's more of a
Jelly<00:06:39.150> red<00:06:39.450> so<00:06:40.170> it's<00:06:40.500> not<00:06:40.560> going<00:06:40.830> to<00:06:40.920> show<00:06:41.130> up

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:41.310 
Jelly red so it's not going to show up

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:44.060 
Jelly red so it's not going to show up
over<00:06:41.520> darker<00:06:42.210> colors<00:06:42.630> as<00:06:42.990> well<00:06:43.020> as<00:06:43.440> lighter

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:44.070 
over darker colors as well as lighter

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:49.310 
over darker colors as well as lighter
colors<00:06:44.690> I<00:06:47.360> mean<00:06:48.360> you<00:06:48.450> can<00:06:48.570> kind<00:06:48.900> of<00:06:49.020> see<00:06:49.200> the

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:49.320 
colors I mean you can kind of see the

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.080 
colors I mean you can kind of see the
red<00:06:49.470> just<00:06:49.680> a<00:06:49.830> little<00:06:50.070> bit<00:06:50.190> if<00:06:50.340> you<00:06:50.430> put<00:06:50.640> a<00:06:50.760> lot

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:51.090 
red just a little bit if you put a lot

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:53.240 
red just a little bit if you put a lot
on<00:06:51.120> but<00:06:51.690> it's<00:06:52.200> really<00:06:52.500> not<00:06:52.770> going<00:06:52.950> to<00:06:53.010> show<00:06:53.220> up

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:53.250 
on but it's really not going to show up

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:55.760 
on but it's really not going to show up
it's<00:06:53.580> not<00:06:53.730> opaque<00:06:54.090> enough<00:06:54.440> since<00:06:55.440> it's<00:06:55.590> more

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:55.770 
it's not opaque enough since it's more

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:58.070 
it's not opaque enough since it's more
of<00:06:55.830> a<00:06:55.860> jelly<00:06:56.070> finished<00:06:56.460> to<00:06:56.820> do<00:06:57.540> that<00:06:57.750> and<00:06:57.960> I

00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:58.080 
of a jelly finished to do that and I

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.660 
of a jelly finished to do that and I
believe<00:06:58.440> they<00:06:58.620> did<00:06:58.830> that<00:06:58.860> just<00:06:59.220> so<00:06:59.400> that<00:06:59.550> the

00:06:59.660 --> 00:06:59.670 
believe they did that just so that the

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:02.930 
believe they did that just so that the
shimmer<00:06:59.940> of<00:07:00.090> the<00:07:01.040> rally<00:07:02.040> pretty<00:07:02.430> pink<00:07:02.700> nail

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:02.940 
shimmer of the rally pretty pink nail

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:07.190 
shimmer of the rally pretty pink nail
polish<00:07:03.120> will<00:07:03.480> come<00:07:03.690> through<00:07:04.020> the<00:07:04.640> shatter<00:07:06.200> but

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:07.200 
polish will come through the shatter but

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:10.580 
polish will come through the shatter but
it<00:07:07.530> works<00:07:07.800> really<00:07:08.040> nicely<00:07:08.340> over<00:07:08.850> white<00:07:09.330> so<00:07:10.140> if

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:10.590 
it works really nicely over white so if

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:13.070 
it works really nicely over white so if
you<00:07:11.070> wanted<00:07:11.430> a<00:07:11.520> red<00:07:11.730> chatter<00:07:12.030> I<00:07:12.330> suggest<00:07:12.780> again

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:13.080 
you wanted a red chatter I suggest again

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.230 
you wanted a red chatter I suggest again
doing<00:07:13.500> it<00:07:13.590> over<00:07:13.740> a<00:07:13.890> lighter<00:07:14.280> color<00:07:14.370> instead<00:07:15.120> of

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:15.240 
doing it over a lighter color instead of

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:18.170 
doing it over a lighter color instead of
a<00:07:15.360> darker<00:07:15.750> cream<00:07:16.050> color<00:07:16.350> this<00:07:17.220> red<00:07:17.760> since

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:18.180 
a darker cream color this red since

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:20.090 
a darker cream color this red since
again<00:07:18.540> it's<00:07:18.810> a<00:07:18.930> jelly<00:07:19.200> will<00:07:19.500> probably<00:07:19.950> look

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:20.100 
again it's a jelly will probably look

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:22.070 
again it's a jelly will probably look
really<00:07:20.160> nice<00:07:20.670> over<00:07:21.060> some<00:07:21.300> other<00:07:21.480> softer

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:22.080 
really nice over some other softer

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.250 
really nice over some other softer
shimmer<00:07:22.350> colors<00:07:22.740> as<00:07:22.980> well<00:07:23.900> let's<00:07:24.900> check<00:07:25.200> back

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:25.260 
shimmer colors as well let's check back

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:29.180 
shimmer colors as well let's check back
on<00:07:25.650> the<00:07:26.040> white<00:07:26.580> from<00:07:27.270> before<00:07:27.690> that's<00:07:28.590> what<00:07:29.040> the

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:29.190 
on the white from before that's what the

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:31.370 
on the white from before that's what the
white<00:07:29.370> shatter<00:07:29.700> looks<00:07:30.030> like<00:07:30.270> over<00:07:30.780> black<00:07:31.080> so

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:31.380 
white shatter looks like over black so

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:34.250 
white shatter looks like over black so
it's<00:07:31.530> pretty<00:07:31.770> opaque<00:07:32.250> um<00:07:32.930> like<00:07:33.930> I<00:07:34.050> thought

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:34.260 
it's pretty opaque um like I thought

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.350 
it's pretty opaque um like I thought
it'd<00:07:34.410> be<00:07:34.440> and<00:07:34.830> it's<00:07:35.520> shattering<00:07:35.880> pretty<00:07:36.180> well

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:36.360 
it'd be and it's shattering pretty well

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:41.800 
it'd be and it's shattering pretty well
so<00:07:36.870> that<00:07:37.140> is<00:07:37.440> the<00:07:38.570> chatter<00:07:39.570> demo<00:07:40.140> for<00:07:40.770> you<00:07:40.980> guys
