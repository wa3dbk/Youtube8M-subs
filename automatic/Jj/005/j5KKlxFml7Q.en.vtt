their<00:00:15.719> apu<00:00:16.230> side<00:00:17.090> today<00:00:18.090> they're<00:00:18.359> actually

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
their apu side today they're actually

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.630 
their apu side today they're actually
unveiling<00:00:19.170> three<00:00:19.590> lineups<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.189> first<00:00:20.400> one<00:00:20.550> is

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
unveiling three lineups the first one is

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.519 
unveiling three lineups the first one is
richland<00:00:21.150> which<00:00:21.869> is<00:00:21.990> actually<00:00:22.230> a<00:00:22.260> replacement

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
richland which is actually a replacement

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.109 
richland which is actually a replacement
for<00:00:22.800> trinity<00:00:23.220> there's<00:00:23.490> very<00:00:23.760> little<00:00:23.910> that

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
for trinity there's very little that

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.580 
for trinity there's very little that
changes<00:00:24.510> from<00:00:24.539> trinity<00:00:25.019> it's<00:00:25.140> mostly<00:00:25.380> on<00:00:25.470> the

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
changes from trinity it's mostly on the

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.800 
changes from trinity it's mostly on the
software<00:00:25.920> side<00:00:26.189> firmware<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:26.910> bios<00:00:27.240> they've

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810

power efficiency in a few ways the two
more<00:00:32.340> interesting<00:00:33.380> platforms<00:00:34.380> are<00:00:34.620> tomash

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
more interesting platforms are tomash

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.310 
more interesting platforms are tomash
and<00:00:35.520> Kabini<00:00:36.090> both<00:00:36.809> of<00:00:36.989> which<00:00:37.110> are<00:00:37.260> really

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
and Kabini both of which are really

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.139 
and Kabini both of which are really
built<00:00:37.680> on<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.950> same<00:00:38.219> chip<00:00:38.640> they're<00:00:38.879> built<00:00:39.030> on

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149

series of Radeon discreet cards you know
about<00:00:56.850> GC<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:58.250> obviously<00:00:59.250> quite<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.210> bit

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
about GC and obviously quite a bit

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.430 
about GC and obviously quite a bit
underpowered<00:01:00.600> compared<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.230> some<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.410> the

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
underpowered compared to some of the

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.470 
underpowered compared to some of the
discrete<00:01:01.800> cards<00:01:02.070> now<00:01:02.730> what's<00:01:03.329> interesting

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
discrete cards now what's interesting

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.570 
discrete cards now what's interesting
about<00:01:03.840> tomash<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.799> kabini<00:01:05.129> is<00:01:05.280> that<00:01:05.460> they're

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
about tomash and kabini is that they're

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.850 
about tomash and kabini is that they're
going<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.790> go<00:01:05.939> into<00:01:06.299> form<00:01:06.990> factors<00:01:07.409> that<00:01:07.619> kind

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
going to go into form factors that kind

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.280 
going to go into form factors that kind
of<00:01:07.979> start<00:01:08.369> in<00:01:08.549> this<00:01:08.760> range<00:01:09.090> this<00:01:09.450> is<00:01:09.510> a<00:01:09.689> Kabini

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
of start in this range this is a Kabini

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.280 
of start in this range this is a Kabini
reference<00:01:10.740> platform<00:01:10.950> that<00:01:11.340> AMD<00:01:11.610> sent<00:01:12.030> us<00:01:12.290> and

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
reference platform that AMD sent us and

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.179 
reference platform that AMD sent us and
it<00:01:13.439> is<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.760> 14<00:01:14.760> inch<00:01:14.970> notebook<00:01:15.240> 1080p<00:01:16.189> laptop

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
it is a 14 inch notebook 1080p laptop

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.050 
it is a 14 inch notebook 1080p laptop
and<00:01:18.119> we'll<00:01:18.570> see<00:01:18.750> Kabini<00:01:19.140> which<00:01:19.530> is<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:20.060> kind

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
and we'll see Kabini which is the kind

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.300 
and we'll see Kabini which is the kind
of<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.210> higher<00:01:21.390> power<00:01:21.689> 15<00:01:22.320> watt<00:01:22.500> there<00:01:22.710> is<00:01:22.799> 125

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
of a higher power 15 watt there is 125

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.100 
of a higher power 15 watt there is 125
watt<00:01:23.610> part<00:01:23.880> as<00:01:24.000> well<00:01:24.119> but<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.450> 15<00:01:24.780> watt<00:01:24.930> will

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
watt part as well but the 15 watt will

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.999 
watt part as well but the 15 watt will
probably<00:01:25.350> be<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.500> most<00:01:25.680> popular<00:01:26.840> SKU<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:28.110> it

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
probably be the most popular SKU and it

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.830 
probably be the most popular SKU and it
will<00:01:29.130> range<00:01:29.369> from<00:01:29.460> this<00:01:29.759> this<00:01:30.150> machine<00:01:30.540> all

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.309 
performance of Kabini the a4 5000 is
pretty<00:03:58.760> good<00:03:58.970> we've<00:03:59.750> ran<00:03:59.900> three<00:04:00.079> to<00:04:00.169> March

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 
pretty good we've ran three to March

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:02.770 
pretty good we've ran three to March
2013<00:04:00.590> on<00:04:01.069> it<00:04:01.220> you<00:04:01.400> can<00:04:01.579> see<00:04:01.819> the<00:04:01.940> results<00:04:02.359> there

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
2013 on it you can see the results there

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.949 
2013 on it you can see the results there
we<00:04:03.609> compared<00:04:04.609> it<00:04:04.699> to<00:04:04.760> clover<00:04:05.209> trail<00:04:05.419> it's<00:04:05.660> it's

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
we compared it to clover trail it's it's

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:07.780 
we compared it to clover trail it's it's
a<00:04:06.049> huge<00:04:06.349> step<00:04:06.680> over<00:04:06.919> what<00:04:07.069> you<00:04:07.160> get<00:04:07.280> a<00:04:07.340> clover

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
a huge step over what you get a clover

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.369 
a huge step over what you get a clover
trail<00:04:08.030> but<00:04:08.419> it's<00:04:08.540> also<00:04:08.690> a<00:04:08.810> pretty<00:04:09.019> big<00:04:09.199> step

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:09.379 
trail but it's also a pretty big step

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:10.689 
trail but it's also a pretty big step
down<00:04:09.410> from<00:04:09.650> what<00:04:09.799> you<00:04:09.919> get<00:04:10.010> on<00:04:10.160> Ivy<00:04:10.489> Bridge

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:10.699

down from what you get on Ivy Bridge
graphics<00:04:11.180> so<00:04:11.449> again<00:04:11.690> it<00:04:11.810> kind<00:04:11.930> of<00:04:12.049> fits<00:04:12.260> in

00:04:12.369 --> 00:04:12.379

this<00:04:12.500> weird<00:04:13.690> placement<00:04:14.690> in<00:04:14.840> the<00:04:14.959> market<00:04:15.669> we

this weird placement in the market we

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:18.460 
this weird placement in the market we
also<00:04:16.880> did<00:04:17.209> play<00:04:17.419> some<00:04:17.630> games<00:04:17.870> on<00:04:18.079> this<00:04:18.260> I<00:04:18.410> was

things like tomash and Kabini will be

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:43.029

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:43.039 
able to move AMD in that direction so if

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:44.620 
able to move AMD in that direction so if
