00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
father and then at the very top once the

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.250 
father and then at the very top once the
wings<00:00:47.070> are<00:00:47.309> sprouted<00:00:47.820> you<00:00:48.510> use<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.960> falling

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
wings are sprouted you use the falling

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.500 
wings are sprouted you use the falling
flame<00:00:49.500> there<00:00:50.280> we<00:00:50.370> go<00:00:50.520> now<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.030> way<00:00:51.210> that<00:00:51.239> this

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
flame there we go now the way that this

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.860 
flame there we go now the way that this
is<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:51.780> is<00:00:52.230> good<00:00:52.590> is<00:00:52.770> because<00:00:52.949> it<00:00:53.820> falling<00:00:54.690> like

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
is a is good is because it falling like

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.389 
is a is good is because it falling like
it<00:00:54.989> gives<00:00:55.170> you<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.500> acceleration<00:00:56.100> all<00:00:56.250> that

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
it gives you the acceleration all that

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.250 
it gives you the acceleration all that
from<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.640> falling<00:00:56.850> flame<00:00:57.210> but<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:57.840> keeps<00:00:58.109> the

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
from the falling flame but it keeps the

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.200 
from the falling flame but it keeps the
effect<00:00:58.530> of<00:00:58.649> ariana's<00:00:59.160> feather<00:00:59.399> when<00:01:00.059> I<00:01:00.090> was

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210

it's<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.490> little<00:01:32.670> bit<00:01:32.790> problematic<00:01:33.000> it's<00:01:33.509> easy

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
it's a little bit problematic it's easy

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:34.910 
it's a little bit problematic it's easy
to<00:01:33.810> kill<00:01:33.960> sender<00:01:34.259> fall<00:01:34.439> at<00:01:34.560> this<00:01:34.680> stage<00:01:34.890> of

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
to kill sender fall at this stage of

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.640 
to kill sender fall at this stage of
course<00:01:35.220> but<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:36.570> know<00:01:36.689> it's<00:01:36.960> like<00:01:37.110> I<00:01:37.170> think<00:01:37.500> a

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
course but you know it's like I think a

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.280 
course but you know it's like I think a
is<00:01:38.610> it<00:01:38.790> two<00:01:38.970> percent<00:01:39.360> drop<00:01:39.540> rate<00:01:39.869> it's<00:01:40.110> it's

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
is it two percent drop rate it's it's

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.289 
is it two percent drop rate it's it's
pretty<00:01:40.680> low<00:01:40.950> though<00:01:41.430> I've<00:01:41.610> ended<00:01:41.880> up<00:01:42.000> getting

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
pretty low though I've ended up getting

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.060 
pretty low though I've ended up getting
like<00:01:42.450> three<00:01:42.659> or<00:01:42.810> four<00:01:42.840> of<00:01:43.200> them<00:01:43.439> drop<00:01:43.770> though

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
like three or four of them drop though

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.950 
like three or four of them drop though
unfortunately<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:45.149> can't<00:01:45.360> have<00:01:45.509> these<00:01:45.689> are

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
unfortunately you can't have these are

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.690 
unfortunately you can't have these are
unique<00:01:46.170> so<00:01:46.439> I<00:01:46.470> couldn't<00:01:46.920> like<00:01:47.159> stack<00:01:47.490> the

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
unique so I couldn't like stack the

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.010 
unique so I couldn't like stack the
multiple<00:01:48.030> ones<00:01:48.210> that<00:01:48.329> I<00:01:48.390> have<00:01:48.509> dropped<00:01:48.689> for<00:01:48.930> me

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
multiple ones that I have dropped for me

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.510 
multiple ones that I have dropped for me
which<00:01:49.110> is<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.259> little<00:01:49.439> bit<00:01:49.619> annoying<00:01:49.829> anyway

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
which is a little bit annoying anyway

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.899 
which is a little bit annoying anyway
this<00:01:50.970> will<00:01:51.210> do<00:01:51.450> me<00:01:51.659> for<00:01:52.409> like<00:01:52.649> 40<00:01:53.369> more<00:01:53.520> trips

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
this will do me for like 40 more trips

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.300 
this will do me for like 40 more trips
39<00:01:54.329> more<00:01:54.509> trips<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.899> hymel<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.530> back<00:01:56.040> and

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
39 more trips to hymel and back and

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.889 
39 more trips to hymel and back and
that's<00:01:56.399> going<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:56.909> last<00:01:57.119> many<00:01:57.450> many<00:01:57.659> many

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
that's going to last many many many

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.560 
that's going to last many many many
months<00:01:58.140> so<00:01:58.890> it's<00:01:59.549> very<00:01:59.790> nice<00:01:59.969> there<00:02:00.299> you<00:02:00.390> go

it will travel roughly from well they're

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.180 
it will travel roughly from well they're
from<00:02:31.120> my<00:02:31.269> garrison<00:02:31.630> it'll<00:02:32.440> travel<00:02:32.590> from<00:02:32.920> there

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
from my garrison it'll travel from there

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.690 
from my garrison it'll travel from there
over<00:02:33.700> to<00:02:34.800> actually<00:02:35.800> further<00:02:36.099> than<00:02:36.489> the<00:02:36.580> high

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
over to actually further than the high

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.640 
over to actually further than the high
mall<00:02:36.910> entrance<00:02:37.330> in<00:02:37.480> the<00:02:37.510> ground<00:02:37.810> so<00:02:38.110> you<00:02:38.319> can

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
mall entrance in the ground so you can

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.949 
mall entrance in the ground so you can
use<00:02:38.769> that<00:02:38.920> to<00:02:38.980> get<00:02:39.160> anywhere<00:02:39.630> basically<00:02:40.630> if

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
use that to get anywhere basically if

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:42.690 
use that to get anywhere basically if
you're<00:02:41.319> an<00:02:41.410> alliance<00:02:41.590> player<00:02:41.920> you<00:02:42.040> can<00:02:42.160> but

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
you're an alliance player you can but

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:43.979 
you're an alliance player you can but
yeah<00:02:42.819> you<00:02:42.910> can<00:02:42.970> get<00:02:43.150> anywhere<00:02:43.480> in<00:02:43.599> drain<00:02:43.840> or

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
yeah you can get anywhere in drain or

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.289 
yeah you can get anywhere in drain or
essentially<00:02:44.650> with<00:02:45.129> this<00:02:45.340> and<00:02:45.610> if<00:02:45.940> you're<00:02:46.060> in

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
essentially with this and if you're in

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:47.910 
essentially with this and if you're in
the<00:02:46.450> Horde<00:02:46.720> well<00:02:47.080> you'll<00:02:47.260> probably<00:02:47.560> have<00:02:47.890> a

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
the Horde well you'll probably have a

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.830 
the Horde well you'll probably have a
bit<00:02:48.190> of<00:02:48.220> trouble<00:02:48.489> getting<00:02:48.970> to<00:02:49.299> some<00:02:49.540> parts<00:02:49.780> of

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
bit of trouble getting to some parts of

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.809 
bit of trouble getting to some parts of
shadow<00:02:50.049> moon<00:02:50.260> but<00:02:50.470> overall<00:02:50.860> it's<00:02:51.519> just<00:02:51.700> going

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 
shadow moon but overall it's just going

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:52.949 
shadow moon but overall it's just going
to<00:02:51.880> let<00:02:51.970> you<00:02:52.060> get<00:02:52.180> everywhere<00:02:52.510> extremely

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
to let you get everywhere extremely

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.890 
to let you get everywhere extremely
quickly<00:02:53.170> that<00:02:53.799> probably<00:02:54.250> only<00:02:54.430> took<00:02:54.670> 30

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
quickly that probably only took 30

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.030 
quickly that probably only took 30
seconds<00:02:55.900> a<00:02:55.930> minute<00:02:56.230> which<00:02:56.380> is<00:02:56.530> far<00:02:56.769> quicker

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
seconds a minute which is far quicker

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.920 
seconds a minute which is far quicker
than<00:02:57.220> a<00:02:57.310> flight<00:02:57.489> point<00:02:57.790> so<00:02:58.420> I<00:02:58.450> just<00:02:58.810> thought

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
than a flight point so I just thought

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:59.970 
than a flight point so I just thought
that<00:02:58.989> would<00:02:59.140> be<00:02:59.170> a<00:02:59.230> handy<00:02:59.590> little<00:02:59.620> thing<00:02:59.890> to

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
that would be a handy little thing to

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.530 
that would be a handy little thing to
show<00:03:00.130> you<00:03:00.160> anyway<00:03:00.730> that's<00:03:00.849> it<00:03:01.060> for<00:03:01.120> me<00:03:01.329> thank

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
show you anyway that's it for me thank
