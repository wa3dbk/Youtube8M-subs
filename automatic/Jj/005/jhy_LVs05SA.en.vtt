00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.259
 remote based on detroit the 6th site to be explained above but 

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:09.310
 we are doing the work of monitoring the engine base bad moment in that 

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:13.780
 moment if we are here below we already have that going to be a corp engine that 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.039
 Your equipment is running out of the possibility of turning the motor base 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.200
 but we are seeing a process by the way yesterday did it one way or another 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:30.590
 davos the engine was the first set that way you get a current trend 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.590
 let's see a behavior they behave recoleta but always 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.530
 renfe 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.180
 for the moment it is at a point of equilibrium 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.900
 if we see the motor being is oriented in such a way that the motor 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.980
 is aiming if jet of air directly trespasses barriers in the 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.330
 catch of that rotary 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.320
 let's put together a 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.290
 he also reserved many votes 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:56.890
 and we'll see 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.890
 as it was counterclockwise 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.270
 over wood opposite direction 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.480
 whatever it is, it has the challenge of being another side 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:12.530
 ps qualitative behavior of the system we are interested in converting this data 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.390
 so we are going to take the times and based on them we will be able to have the 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.470
 range of operation of each of the topics that we have on the right 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.630
 we are interested in this event is quite broad in the ctb that can be 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.630
 take a very slow turn and having risen very fast according to him 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.050
 in the control order given to the system 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.550
 then let's see with itati increase a quite event turn 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.280
 nando lion 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.180
 a very light orientation 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.180
 being an engine 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.600
 here we are seeing 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.600
 coming slowly clockwise 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.840
 it's a bit difficult to control 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.620
 rosemary had felt contrary 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.129
 let's take it later feel like this 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:12.679
 With the obtained data we can 

00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:14.569
 a little comparison 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.569
 about the shooting penalties we have for 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:19.239
 this erection system
