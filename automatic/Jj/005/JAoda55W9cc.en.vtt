 in manual mode now we will turn on 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.730
 metal detector and see how he 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.730
 works 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:31.800
 we immediately after switching on 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:38.120
 main search mode in number mode

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:59.250
 The central part is reflected in numeric 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:02.780
 target rating and on the right we see 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:05.130
 running arrows which mean that 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.940
 metal detector is in mode

00:04:52.740 --> 00:05:04.410
 using the plus and minus buttons reducing 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:11.130
 parameters and increasing them can enable 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:14.520

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:30.699
 either go to mode

 back here are 

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:53.340
 metal detector controls and 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:56.420
 such indications are liquid crystal
