I'm going to be doing a installation of
a<00:00:32.430> very<00:00:33.030> nice<00:00:33.210> video<00:00:33.449> card<00:00:33.629> I<00:00:34.079> think

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
a very nice video card I think

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.340 
a very nice video card I think
complement<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.010> system<00:00:35.399> quite<00:00:35.670> well<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.350> I

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
complement the system quite well and I

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.680 
complement the system quite well and I
also<00:00:37.559> have<00:00:38.010> we're<00:00:38.609> gonna<00:00:38.730> replace<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.420> dual

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
also have we're gonna replace the dual

also have we're gonna replace the dual
core<00:00:39.960> AMD<00:00:40.350> Athlon<00:00:40.949> I'd<00:00:41.100> blade<00:00:41.600> 7550<00:00:42.600> in<00:00:42.750> there

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
core AMD Athlon I'd blade 7550 in there

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.990 
core AMD Athlon I'd blade 7550 in there
and<00:00:43.399> upgrade<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.850> phenom<00:00:45.660> x4

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
and upgrade it to a phenom x4

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.270 
and upgrade it to a phenom x4
9750<00:00:48.170> I've<00:00:49.170> already<00:00:49.500> upgraded<00:00:49.859> the<00:00:50.010> power

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
9750 I've already upgraded the power

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.990 
9750 I've already upgraded the power
supply<00:00:50.730> it's<00:00:51.180> got<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.890> 430<00:00:52.890> watt<00:00:53.160> thermaltake

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
supply it's got a 430 watt thermaltake

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.720 
supply it's got a 430 watt thermaltake
unit<00:00:54.559> not<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.710> biggest<00:00:56.039> in<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.250> world<00:00:56.309> but

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
unit not the biggest in the world but

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.369 
unit not the biggest in the world but
then<00:00:56.850> again<00:00:56.969> this<00:00:57.300> is<00:00:57.449> not<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.660> gaming<00:00:58.260> machine

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
then again this is not a gaming machine

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.279 
then again this is not a gaming machine
this<00:00:59.370> is<00:00:59.519> going<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.699> be<00:00:59.910> a<00:01:00.179> really<00:01:00.750> nice<00:01:00.989> office

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
this is going to be a really nice office

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.919 
this is going to be a really nice office
computer<00:01:01.949> I<00:01:02.190> think<00:01:02.760> my<00:01:02.879> customer<00:01:03.329> be<00:01:03.510> quite

00:01:03.919 --> 00:01:03.929 
computer I think my customer be quite

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:06.230 
computer I think my customer be quite
happy<00:01:04.410> with<00:01:04.560> it<00:01:04.740> when<00:01:05.280> she<00:01:05.400> gets<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.730> back<00:01:05.910> and

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
happy with it when she gets it back and

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.110 
happy with it when she gets it back and
it<00:01:07.020> will<00:01:07.170> more<00:01:08.100> than<00:01:08.130> suffice<00:01:08.550> for<00:01:08.790> her

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:09.120 
it will more than suffice for her

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.140 
it will more than suffice for her
everyday<00:01:09.390> needs<00:01:09.800> the<00:01:10.800> RAM<00:01:11.010> is<00:01:11.280> maxed<00:01:11.640> out<00:01:11.880> I

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
everyday needs the RAM is maxed out I

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.570 
everyday needs the RAM is maxed out I
believe<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.480> unit<00:01:12.690> supports<00:01:13.110> 4<00:01:13.470> gigs<00:01:13.800> so

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
believe the unit supports 4 gigs so

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.320 
believe the unit supports 4 gigs so
we've<00:01:14.730> got<00:01:14.880> that<00:01:15.060> maxed<00:01:15.510> out<00:01:15.660> and<00:01:16.970> once<00:01:17.970> I<00:01:18.150> get

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
we've got that maxed out and once I get

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.610 
we've got that maxed out and once I get
all<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.570> hardware<00:01:18.930> in<00:01:19.110> there<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.500> get

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:19.620 
all the hardware in there and get

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.320 
all the hardware in there and get
everything<00:01:19.860> done<00:01:20.250> we'll<00:01:20.550> try<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:20.910> do<00:01:21.120> some

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
everything done we'll try to do some

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.090 
everything done we'll try to do some
videos<00:01:21.690> on<00:01:21.990> that<00:01:22.200> show<00:01:22.440> you<00:01:22.500> guys<00:01:22.710> some<00:01:23.010> of<00:01:23.040> the

videos on that show you guys some of the

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.400 
videos on that show you guys some of the
upgrades<00:01:23.520> as<00:01:23.730> they<00:01:23.910> take<00:01:24.120> place<00:01:24.450> along<00:01:25.140> with

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:25.410 
upgrades as they take place along with

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:26.930 
upgrades as they take place along with
some<00:01:25.800> of<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:25.950> upgrades<00:01:26.070> I've<00:01:26.490> already<00:01:26.730> done

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
some of the upgrades I've already done

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.480 
some of the upgrades I've already done
to<00:01:27.120> this<00:01:27.240> unit<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.980> then<00:01:28.980> we'll<00:01:29.220> see<00:01:29.370> the

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
to this unit and then we'll see the

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.060 
to this unit and then we'll see the
finished<00:01:29.790> product<00:01:30.170> where<00:01:31.170> some<00:01:31.350> windows<00:01:31.650> 7

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
finished product where some windows 7

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.740 
finished product where some windows 7
benchmark<00:01:32.550> scores<00:01:32.910> on<00:01:33.120> there<00:01:33.240> I<00:01:33.270> know<00:01:33.420> people

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
benchmark scores on there I know people

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.630 
benchmark scores on there I know people
think<00:01:34.140> those<00:01:34.350> don't<00:01:34.650> mean<00:01:34.860> much<00:01:35.130> but<00:01:35.370> at<00:01:35.490> least

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
think those don't mean much but at least

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.380 
think those don't mean much but at least
it<00:01:36.540> gives<00:01:36.780> you<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:36.990> gauge<00:01:37.200> or<00:01:37.500> 7.9<00:01:38.250> is<00:01:38.430> good<00:01:38.700> you

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
it gives you a gauge or 7.9 is good you

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.300 
it gives you a gauge or 7.9 is good you
know<00:01:39.540> if<00:01:39.660> that's<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.960> best<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:40.350> can<00:01:40.470> get<00:01:40.680> if

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
know if that's the best you can get if

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.630 
know if that's the best you can get if
you<00:01:41.400> get<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.550> 7.0<00:01:42.270> or<00:01:42.420> 7.2<00:01:43.200> that<00:01:43.920> gets<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.250> really

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
you get a 7.0 or 7.2 that gets a really

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.890 
you get a 7.0 or 7.2 that gets a really
you<00:01:44.850> know<00:01:44.970> shows<00:01:45.270> that<00:01:45.420> you<00:01:45.540> get<00:01:45.660> a<00:01:45.690> pretty

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900 
you know shows that you get a pretty

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.110 
you know shows that you get a pretty
darn<00:01:46.170> good<00:01:46.260> system<00:01:46.830> there<00:01:47.040> at<00:01:47.610> least<00:01:47.820> in<00:01:47.970> my

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:48.120 
darn good system there at least in my

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.240 
darn good system there at least in my
opinion<00:01:48.630> something<00:01:49.050> that<00:01:49.350> will<00:01:49.470> keep<00:01:49.740> up<00:01:50.010> with

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
opinion something that will keep up with

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.650 
opinion something that will keep up with
most<00:01:51.000> of<00:01:51.330> today's<00:01:51.660> tests<00:01:52.320> with<00:01:52.680> exception<00:01:53.250> to
