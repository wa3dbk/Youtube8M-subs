00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
hey it's low Prince 47 and I don't want

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.160 
hey it's low Prince 47 and I don't want
to<00:00:02.850> really<00:00:03.000> I<00:00:03.240> don't<00:00:03.389> really<00:00:03.629> want<00:00:03.929> to<00:00:03.990> do<00:00:04.140> this

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
to really I don't really want to do this

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.460 
to really I don't really want to do this
because<00:00:04.500> this<00:00:05.490> is<00:00:05.549> step<00:00:06.029> two<00:00:06.270> to<00:00:06.540> how<00:00:07.109> to<00:00:07.170> build

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
because this is step two to how to build

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.140 
because this is step two to how to build
an<00:00:07.589> extreme<00:00:07.950> gaming<00:00:08.160> PC<00:00:08.610> and<00:00:08.849> this<00:00:08.970> is

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
an extreme gaming PC and this is

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.589 
an extreme gaming PC and this is
installing<00:00:09.599> the<00:00:09.840> CPU<00:00:10.349> now<00:00:11.389> installing<00:00:12.389> the

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
installing the CPU now installing the

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.680 
installing the CPU now installing the
CPU<00:00:13.049> is<00:00:13.110> probably<00:00:13.469> one<00:00:13.679> of<00:00:13.710> the<00:00:13.860> most

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:14.690 
CPU is probably one of the most

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.230 
CPU is probably one of the most
nerve-racking<00:00:15.690> parts<00:00:16.320> of<00:00:16.500> building<00:00:16.890> a<00:00:17.010> pc<00:00:17.520> but

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
nerve-racking parts of building a pc but

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.660 
nerve-racking parts of building a pc but
i<00:00:18.539> can<00:00:18.900> tell<00:00:19.109> because<00:00:19.260> i'm<00:00:19.590> so<00:00:20.220> nervous<00:00:20.400> right

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
i can tell because i'm so nervous right

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.810 
i can tell because i'm so nervous right
now<00:00:21.289> because<00:00:22.289> once<00:00:22.650> you<00:00:22.859> bend<00:00:23.070> those<00:00:23.220> pins<00:00:23.580> in

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
now because once you bend those pins in

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.580 
now because once you bend those pins in
the<00:00:23.970> motherboard<00:00:24.390> there's<00:00:24.990> no<00:00:25.170> returning

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
the motherboard there's no returning

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.980 
the motherboard there's no returning
there's<00:00:26.279> no<00:00:26.460> returning<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:27.570> motherboard

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
there's no returning the motherboard

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.120 
there's no returning the motherboard
yeah<00:00:28.230> there's<00:00:28.470> no<00:00:28.560> returning<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:28.980> mother

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
yeah there's no returning the mother

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.200 
yeah there's no returning the mother
would<00:00:29.250> sing<00:00:29.580> as<00:00:29.730> I<00:00:29.820> just<00:00:30.029> hit<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.210> table<00:00:30.830> ok<00:00:32.210> so

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
would sing as I just hit the table ok so

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.479 
would sing as I just hit the table ok so
you<00:00:33.780> after<00:00:34.260> you<00:00:34.739> have<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:34.950> install<00:00:35.219> it<00:00:35.280> they

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
you after you have to install it they

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:36.560 
you after you have to install it they
say<00:00:35.640> you<00:00:35.700> have<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:35.880> install<00:00:36.210> it<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:36.450> then

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
say you have to install it and then

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.440 
say you have to install it and then
remove<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.809> cover<00:00:37.110> so<00:00:37.350> that's<00:00:37.620> what<00:00:37.770> I'll<00:00:37.890> do

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:38.450 
remove the cover so that's what I'll do

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.910 
remove the cover so that's what I'll do
now<00:00:40.520> you<00:00:41.520> pull<00:00:41.790> this<00:00:41.969> ledge<00:00:42.180> at<00:00:42.420> first<00:00:42.920> which

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
now you pull this ledge at first which

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.060 
now you pull this ledge at first which
is<00:00:44.129> like<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:45.140> when<00:00:46.140> I<00:00:46.200> how<00:00:46.320> can<00:00:46.379> you<00:00:46.530> tell<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:46.920> have

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
is like a when I how can you tell I have

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.170 
is like a when I how can you tell I have
an<00:00:47.160> idea<00:00:47.250> wait<00:00:47.579> one<00:00:48.180> sec<00:00:48.950> all<00:00:49.950> right<00:00:49.980> if<00:00:50.579> the

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
an idea wait one sec all right if the

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.389 
an idea wait one sec all right if the
motherboard<00:00:51.449> is<00:00:51.660> facing<00:00:52.020> upwards<00:00:52.379> you<00:00:53.190> move

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
motherboard is facing upwards you move

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.930 
motherboard is facing upwards you move
your<00:00:53.730> imp<00:00:53.910> you're<00:00:54.360> under<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.690> left<00:00:55.110> latch

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
your imp you're under the left latch

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.670 
your imp you're under the left latch
first<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.210> then<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:57.899> do<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.109> right<00:00:58.260> one<00:00:58.440> so

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
first and then you do the right one so

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.069 
first and then you do the right one so
if<00:00:58.949> you're<00:00:59.489> reading<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.879> text<00:01:00.239> in<00:01:00.420> the

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
if you're reading the text in the

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.720 
if you're reading the text in the
position<00:01:01.469> it's<00:01:01.649> supposed<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:01.980> be<00:01:02.129> read<00:01:02.280> on<00:01:02.430> the

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
position it's supposed to be read on the

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.230 
position it's supposed to be read on the
cover<00:01:03.629> of<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.930> cpu<00:01:04.890> socket<00:01:05.220> you<00:01:05.850> remove<00:01:06.119> the

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
cover of the cpu socket you remove the

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.510 
cover of the cpu socket you remove the
left<00:01:06.420> one<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:06.720> then<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.869> right<00:01:07.020> one<00:01:07.520> so

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
left one and then the right one so

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.980 
left one and then the right one so
because<00:01:08.909> there's<00:01:09.119> two<00:01:09.299> handles<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.840> this

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
because there's two handles to this

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.320 
because there's two handles to this
these<00:01:10.950> two<00:01:11.100> handles<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.580> this<00:01:11.729> as<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:11.970> can<00:01:12.119> see

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
these two handles to this as you can see

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.300 
these two handles to this as you can see
ok<00:01:13.049> now<00:01:13.229> how<00:01:13.350> do<00:01:13.409> we<00:01:13.500> lift<00:01:13.710> this<00:01:13.799> up<00:01:16.070> ok<00:01:17.070> I'll

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
ok now how do we lift this up ok I'll

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.910 
ok now how do we lift this up ok I'll
get<00:01:17.520> your<00:01:17.640> finger<00:01:17.880> in<00:01:17.970> there<00:01:18.619> all<00:01:19.619> right<00:01:19.770> it

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
get your finger in there all right it

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.830 
get your finger in there all right it
says<00:01:20.189> install<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.729> cpu<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.420> then<00:01:21.540> remove<00:01:21.780> the

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
says install the cpu and then remove the

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.749 
says install the cpu and then remove the
cover<00:01:22.700> so<00:01:23.700> that's<00:01:24.060> what<00:01:24.210> I'm<00:01:24.299> gonna<00:01:24.450> be<00:01:24.600> doing

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
cover so that's what I'm gonna be doing

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.050 
cover so that's what I'm gonna be doing
now<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:27.720> tricky<00:01:28.080> bit<00:01:28.229> is<00:01:28.500> taking<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.549> CPI<00:01:29.939> out

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
now the tricky bit is taking the CPI out

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:40.230 
now the tricky bit is taking the CPI out
of<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.240> plastic<00:01:31.640> ok<00:01:33.650> my<00:01:34.650> god<00:01:34.860> I'm<00:01:34.979> so<00:01:35.130> nervous

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:48.840 

we'll<00:01:41.240> go<00:01:41.390> to<00:01:41.659> notice

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.060 

he's<00:01:49.850> supposed<00:01:50.060> to<00:01:50.119> take<00:01:50.329> that<00:01:50.359> up<00:01:50.890> all<00:01:51.890> right

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
he's supposed to take that up all right

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.590 
he's supposed to take that up all right
so<00:01:52.280> there<00:01:52.399> should<00:01:52.520> be<00:01:52.549> a<00:01:52.700> little<00:01:52.939> error<00:01:53.210> on<00:01:53.509> the

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
so there should be a little error on the

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.219 
so there should be a little error on the
motherboard<00:01:53.840> I<00:01:54.490> can<00:01:55.490> see<00:01:55.640> the<00:01:55.670> error<00:01:56.049> here<00:01:57.049> and

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
motherboard I can see the error here and

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:02.609 
motherboard I can see the error here and
there<00:01:57.350> should<00:01:57.439> be<00:01:57.590> a<00:01:57.619> little<00:01:57.770> error<00:01:57.950> on<00:01:58.039> cpu

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:05.169 

I'm<00:02:03.619> having<00:02:03.920> trouble<00:02:04.039> finding<00:02:04.459> cpu<00:02:04.969> help

00:02:05.169 --> 00:02:05.179 
I'm having trouble finding cpu help

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:15.610 
I'm having trouble finding cpu help
people<00:02:05.630> so<00:02:13.810> now<00:02:14.810> I'm<00:02:14.959> wishing<00:02:15.049> I<00:02:15.290> had<00:02:15.440> some
