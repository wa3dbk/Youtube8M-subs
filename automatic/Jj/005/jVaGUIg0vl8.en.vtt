comedians called wigglin which are made

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.950 
comedians called wigglin which are made
by<00:00:09.129> taking<00:00:09.490> a<00:00:09.700> naturally<00:00:10.120> drive<00:00:10.360> oil<00:00:10.629> like

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:10.960 
by taking a naturally drive oil like

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.439 
by taking a naturally drive oil like
linseed<00:00:11.410> oil<00:00:11.500> or<00:00:11.830> soy<00:00:12.340> oil<00:00:12.700> and<00:00:13.030> chemically

00:00:13.439 --> 00:00:13.449 
linseed oil or soy oil and chemically

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:15.660 
linseed oil or soy oil and chemically
treating<00:00:13.930> it<00:00:14.080> with<00:00:14.379> alcohol<00:00:14.619> and<00:00:15.129> acid<00:00:15.520> which

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:15.670 
treating it with alcohol and acid which

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:17.310 
treating it with alcohol and acid which
is<00:00:15.789> where<00:00:15.940> the<00:00:16.029> name<00:00:16.150> comes<00:00:16.390> from<00:00:16.480> to<00:00:17.080> take<00:00:17.199> the

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:17.320 
is where the name comes from to take the

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.050 
is where the name comes from to take the
first<00:00:17.500> part<00:00:17.740> of<00:00:17.770> alcohol<00:00:18.250> and<00:00:18.520> the<00:00:18.670> last<00:00:18.850> part

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:19.060 
first part of alcohol and the last part

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.480 
first part of alcohol and the last part
of<00:00:19.150> acid<00:00:19.539> you<00:00:19.630> get<00:00:19.750> the<00:00:19.840> word<00:00:19.960> alkyd<00:00:20.740> and<00:00:20.890> what

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:21.490 
of acid you get the word alkyd and what

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.249 
of acid you get the word alkyd and what
the<00:00:21.609> alkanes<00:00:21.939> do<00:00:22.150> is<00:00:22.300> they<00:00:22.449> speed<00:00:22.810> the<00:00:22.990> drying

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:23.259 
the alkanes do is they speed the drying

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:26.159 
the alkanes do is they speed the drying
rate<00:00:23.560> of<00:00:23.800> a<00:00:23.890> conventional<00:00:24.369> oil<00:00:24.660> by<00:00:25.660> about<00:00:25.839> 50%

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:26.169 
rate of a conventional oil by about 50%

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:28.439 
rate of a conventional oil by about 50%
so<00:00:26.769> if<00:00:27.099> you<00:00:27.249> if<00:00:27.699> you<00:00:27.789> take<00:00:27.939> them<00:00:28.150> they'll<00:00:28.269> dry

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:28.449 
so if you if you take them they'll dry

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:31.079 
so if you if you take them they'll dry
in<00:00:28.509> about<00:00:28.720> 2<00:00:29.169> to<00:00:29.199> 12<00:00:29.589> days<00:00:29.769> oils<00:00:30.249> normally<00:00:30.699> and

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:31.089 
in about 2 to 12 days oils normally and

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:32.790 
in about 2 to 12 days oils normally and
that'll<00:00:31.300> take<00:00:31.509> that<00:00:31.720> time<00:00:31.960> down<00:00:32.140> to<00:00:32.349> about<00:00:32.500> 1

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.800 
that'll take that time down to about 1

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.920 
that'll take that time down to about 1
to<00:00:32.980> 6<00:00:33.250> days<00:00:33.550> depending<00:00:34.120> on<00:00:34.210> upon<00:00:34.390> the<00:00:34.540> pigment

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:34.930 
to 6 days depending on upon the pigment

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.300 
to 6 days depending on upon the pigment
and<00:00:35.350> you<00:00:35.440> have<00:00:35.560> to<00:00:35.650> remember<00:00:35.770> that's<00:00:35.980> touch

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:36.310 
and you have to remember that's touch

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.370 
and you have to remember that's touch
dry<00:00:36.640> so<00:00:36.910> you'd<00:00:37.030> still<00:00:37.270> want<00:00:37.510> to<00:00:37.570> wait<00:00:37.750> about<00:00:37.960> 6

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:38.380 
dry so you'd still want to wait about 6

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:39.960 
dry so you'd still want to wait about 6
to<00:00:38.530> 12<00:00:38.650> months<00:00:39.160> depending<00:00:39.310> upon<00:00:39.640> the

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:39.970 
to 12 months depending upon the

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.880 
to 12 months depending upon the
thickness<00:00:40.000> of<00:00:40.570> your<00:00:40.870> paint<00:00:41.230> later<00:00:41.410> before<00:00:41.800> you

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
thickness of your paint later before you

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.800 
thickness of your paint later before you
put<00:00:42.070> that<00:00:42.100> final<00:00:42.400> varnish<00:00:42.820> on<00:00:43.030> liquid

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:43.810 
put that final varnish on liquid

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.870 
put that final varnish on liquid
originally<00:00:44.320> is<00:00:44.380> the<00:00:44.560> first<00:00:44.950> liquid<00:00:45.280> produced

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:45.880 
originally is the first liquid produced

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.480 
originally is the first liquid produced
and<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:47.260> can<00:00:47.320> see<00:00:47.560> that<00:00:47.650> it's<00:00:47.800> quite<00:00:48.010> fluid

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:48.490 
and you can see that it's quite fluid

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:50.160 
and you can see that it's quite fluid
and<00:00:48.670> what<00:00:49.450> I'm<00:00:49.540> going<00:00:49.660> to<00:00:49.690> do<00:00:49.840> is<00:00:49.930> I'm<00:00:50.020> going<00:00:50.110> to

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
and what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.830 
and what I'm going to do is I'm going to
take<00:00:50.290> a<00:00:50.320> proportion<00:00:50.950> of<00:00:51.130> about<00:00:51.730> 2<00:00:52.210> parts<00:00:52.660> of

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:52.840 
take a proportion of about 2 parts of

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.610 
take a proportion of about 2 parts of
oil<00:00:53.650> to<00:00:54.580> one<00:00:55.090> part<00:00:55.120> liquid<00:00:55.840> and<00:00:56.170> what<00:00:56.440> that's

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620 
oil to one part liquid and what that's

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:57.960 
oil to one part liquid and what that's
going<00:00:56.770> to<00:00:56.830> do<00:00:56.980> is<00:00:57.130> it's<00:00:57.280> going<00:00:57.310> to<00:00:57.430> reduce<00:00:57.610> its

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:57.970 
going to do is it's going to reduce its

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.270 
going to do is it's going to reduce its
consistency<00:00:58.660> and<00:00:58.870> look<00:00:59.290> how<00:00:59.410> fluid<00:00:59.890> that<00:01:00.040> gets

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
consistency and look how fluid that gets

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.070 
consistency and look how fluid that gets
gets<00:01:00.520> nice<00:01:00.700> and<00:01:00.730> fluid<00:01:01.060> it's<00:01:01.420> very<00:01:01.660> very<00:01:01.840> rich

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:02.080 
gets nice and fluid it's very very rich

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.390 
gets nice and fluid it's very very rich
color<00:01:02.940> improves<00:01:03.940> the<00:01:04.119> flow<00:01:05.130> it<00:01:06.130> will<00:01:06.189> also

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:06.400 
color improves the flow it will also

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.539 
color improves the flow it will also
increase<00:01:06.729> film<00:01:07.180> durability<00:01:07.950> so<00:01:08.950> when<00:01:09.100> I<00:01:09.130> apply

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:09.549 
increase film durability so when I apply

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:11.219 
increase film durability so when I apply
it<00:01:09.609> onto<00:01:09.969> the<00:01:10.060> canvas<00:01:10.240> it's<00:01:10.659> gonna<00:01:10.780> make<00:01:11.049> it

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
it onto the canvas it's gonna make it

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:13.919 
it onto the canvas it's gonna make it
more<00:01:11.740> durable<00:01:12.149> adhere<00:01:13.149> even<00:01:13.420> better

00:01:13.919 --> 00:01:13.929 
more durable adhere even better

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:17.010 
more durable adhere even better
crease<00:01:14.770> the<00:01:14.920> flexibility<00:01:15.609> and<00:01:15.850> give<00:01:16.840> it<00:01:16.929> a

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
crease the flexibility and give it a

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.359 
crease the flexibility and give it a
semi<00:01:17.789> semi-gloss<00:01:18.789> finish<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:20.229> it<00:01:20.259> and<00:01:20.619> it

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
semi semi-gloss finish to it and it

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:22.770 
semi semi-gloss finish to it and it
would<00:01:21.460> be<00:01:21.609> similar<00:01:21.969> to<00:01:21.999> if<00:01:22.390> we<00:01:22.509> were<00:01:22.600> dealing

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
would be similar to if we were dealing

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.410 
would be similar to if we were dealing
with<00:01:23.020> drying<00:01:23.890> oils<00:01:24.369> it<00:01:24.609> will<00:01:24.880> be<00:01:24.939> similar<00:01:25.270> to<00:01:25.299> a

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
with drying oils it will be similar to a

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.819 
with drying oils it will be similar to a
linseed<00:01:25.869> oil<00:01:25.960> but<00:01:26.259> have<00:01:26.380> all<00:01:26.499> those<00:01:26.619> great

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:26.829 
linseed oil but have all those great

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:30.359 
linseed oil but have all those great
properties<00:01:27.399> but<00:01:27.579> it<00:01:27.609> would<00:01:27.789> dry<00:01:28.030> faster<00:01:29.369> this

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:30.369 
properties but it would dry faster this

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:31.980 
properties but it would dry faster this
painting<00:01:30.729> I<00:01:30.789> used<00:01:30.999> liquid<00:01:31.210> original<00:01:31.780> because

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
painting I used liquid original because

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.690 
painting I used liquid original because
I<00:01:32.049> want<00:01:32.200> to<00:01:32.289> get<00:01:32.350> the<00:01:32.439> paint<00:01:32.649> to<00:01:32.770> fall<00:01:33.069> more<00:01:33.340> oil

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
I want to get the paint to fall more oil

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.609 
I want to get the paint to fall more oil
paint<00:01:34.060> out<00:01:34.240> of<00:01:34.270> the<00:01:34.389> tube<00:01:34.630> can<00:01:34.840> be<00:01:34.899> a<00:01:35.020> bit<00:01:35.229> short

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
paint out of the tube can be a bit short

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:37.770 
paint out of the tube can be a bit short
sort<00:01:36.009> of<00:01:36.069> a<00:01:36.130> stiff<00:01:36.340> consistency<00:01:36.600> this<00:01:37.600> was

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
sort of a stiff consistency this was

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.899 
sort of a stiff consistency this was
done<00:01:37.960> on<00:01:38.170> location<00:01:38.409> and<00:01:39.130> what<00:01:39.280> I<00:01:39.310> wanted<00:01:39.639> to<00:01:39.759> do

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
done on location and what I wanted to do

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:42.539 
done on location and what I wanted to do
is<00:01:40.240> work<00:01:40.569> very<00:01:40.899> quickly<00:01:41.159> from<00:01:42.159> this<00:01:42.280> live

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:42.549 
is work very quickly from this live

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:45.749 
is work very quickly from this live
setting<00:01:43.090> and<00:01:43.299> work<00:01:43.960> wet<00:01:44.289> into<00:01:44.619> wet<00:01:44.799> so<00:01:45.159> it<00:01:45.490> took

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
setting and work wet into wet so it took

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:47.340 
setting and work wet into wet so it took
that<00:01:45.969> original<00:01:46.359> stiff<00:01:46.569> consistency<00:01:46.719> and

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
that original stiff consistency and

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.959 
that original stiff consistency and
loosen<00:01:47.709> that<00:01:47.829> up<00:01:47.889> so<00:01:48.130> I<00:01:48.189> can<00:01:48.340> really<00:01:48.520> move<00:01:48.759> the

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:48.969 
loosen that up so I can really move the

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:50.940 
loosen that up so I can really move the
paint<00:01:49.179> around<00:01:49.299> quickly<00:01:49.810> get<00:01:50.530> these<00:01:50.709> very

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
paint around quickly get these very

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.069 
paint around quickly get these very
simple<00:01:51.189> abstracted<00:01:51.969> shapes<00:01:52.270> and<00:01:52.539> get<00:01:52.990> the

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:53.079 
simple abstracted shapes and get the

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:56.489 
simple abstracted shapes and get the
desired<00:01:53.380> effect<00:01:53.530> that<00:01:53.920> I<00:01:54.009> wanted<00:01:55.289> liquid<00:01:56.289> fine

00:01:56.489 --> 00:01:56.499 
desired effect that I wanted liquid fine

liquid original quite a bit more you can

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.269 
liquid original quite a bit more you can
see<00:02:04.600> that<00:02:04.779> and<00:02:05.049> it's<00:02:05.439> going<00:02:05.740> to<00:02:05.950> increase

00:02:06.269 --> 00:02:06.279 
see that and it's going to increase

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:08.550 
see that and it's going to increase
transparency<00:02:06.729> it's<00:02:07.329> gonna<00:02:07.450> dry<00:02:07.719> to<00:02:07.779> a<00:02:07.959> gloss

was<00:02:32.409> my<00:02:32.530> medium<00:02:32.860> of<00:02:33.010> choice<00:02:33.040> for<00:02:33.459> this

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
was my medium of choice for this

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.160 
was my medium of choice for this
painting<00:02:34.000> because<00:02:34.299> it's<00:02:34.569> both<00:02:34.750> a<00:02:34.900> small

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
painting because it's both a small

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.960 
painting because it's both a small
painting<00:02:35.530> and<00:02:35.709> technically<00:02:36.489> it's<00:02:36.670> a<00:02:36.760> tight

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
painting and technically it's a tight

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.610 
painting and technically it's a tight
painting<00:02:37.420> meaning<00:02:38.049> that<00:02:38.170> I<00:02:38.200> had<00:02:38.379> a<00:02:38.409> lot<00:02:38.590> of

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
painting meaning that I had a lot of

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.920 
painting meaning that I had a lot of
little<00:02:38.890> tiny<00:02:39.220> fine<00:02:39.909> details<00:02:40.390> that<00:02:40.629> I<00:02:40.659> wanted

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
little tiny fine details that I wanted

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.390 
little tiny fine details that I wanted
to<00:02:40.989> get<00:02:41.230> particularly<00:02:41.560> in<00:02:41.739> the<00:02:41.829> upper<00:02:42.099> part<00:02:42.370> of

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
to get particularly in the upper part of

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.640 
to get particularly in the upper part of
the<00:02:42.489> bag<00:02:42.670> so<00:02:43.450> I<00:02:43.480> had<00:02:43.599> a<00:02:43.629> lot<00:02:43.810> of<00:02:43.840> glazing<00:02:44.409> that<00:02:44.439> I

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
the bag so I had a lot of glazing that I

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.470 
the bag so I had a lot of glazing that I
wanted<00:02:44.890> to<00:02:45.010> do<00:02:45.129> with<00:02:45.430> the<00:02:45.549> pair<00:02:45.790> of<00:02:46.060> glazing<00:02:46.420> of

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
wanted to do with the pair of glazing of

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.690 
wanted to do with the pair of glazing of
colors<00:02:46.900> and<00:02:47.140> the<00:02:47.860> liquid<00:02:48.129> fine<00:02:48.280> detail<00:02:48.579> is

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
colors and the liquid fine detail is

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.000 
colors and the liquid fine detail is
ideal<00:02:49.150> for<00:02:49.450> speeding<00:02:50.260> the<00:02:50.349> drying<00:02:50.590> rate<00:02:50.799> and

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
ideal for speeding the drying rate and

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.789 
ideal for speeding the drying rate and
being<00:02:51.189> able<00:02:51.280> to<00:02:51.400> do<00:02:51.579> several<00:02:51.939> glazing<00:02:52.569> layers

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799

liquid<00:02:53.799> white<00:02:53.950> gel<00:02:54.220> is<00:02:54.370> a<00:02:54.400> gel<00:02:54.819> medium<00:02:55.150> so<00:02:55.840> I'm

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
liquid white gel is a gel medium so I'm

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
liquid white gel is a gel medium so I'm
actually<00:02:55.989> gonna<00:02:56.200> use<00:02:56.290> a<00:02:56.409> palette<00:02:56.739> knife<00:02:56.890> to

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
actually gonna use a palette knife to

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.559 
actually gonna use a palette knife to
get<00:02:57.189> some<00:02:57.459> out<00:02:57.879> of<00:02:58.030> the<00:02:58.090> bottle<00:02:58.420> right<00:02:58.510> there

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
get some out of the bottle right there

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.089 
get some out of the bottle right there
and<00:02:58.750> you<00:02:58.810> can<00:02:58.900> see<00:02:58.989> very<00:02:59.170> easily<00:02:59.409> it's<00:02:59.829> a<00:02:59.920> lot

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:00.099 
and you can see very easily it's a lot

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:02.940 
and you can see very easily it's a lot
thicker<00:03:01.000> than<00:03:01.360> the<00:03:02.049> other<00:03:02.260> two<00:03:02.500> mediums<00:03:02.769> and<00:03:02.890> I

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
thicker than the other two mediums and I

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.050 
thicker than the other two mediums and I
just<00:03:03.129> showed<00:03:03.250> you<00:03:03.310> and<00:03:03.670> I'm<00:03:03.730> gonna<00:03:03.819> take<00:03:04.000> a

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
just showed you and I'm gonna take a

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.390 
just showed you and I'm gonna take a
some<00:03:04.599> paint<00:03:04.810> right<00:03:04.989> here<00:03:05.230> and<00:03:05.680> mix<00:03:06.040> it<00:03:06.159> in<00:03:06.280> with

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
some paint right here and mix it in with

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.220 
some paint right here and mix it in with
this<00:03:06.579> and<00:03:06.939> it's<00:03:07.390> what<00:03:07.540> we<00:03:07.629> call<00:03:07.840> thixotropic

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
this and it's what we call thixotropic

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.740 
this and it's what we call thixotropic
which<00:03:08.980> is<00:03:09.400> really<00:03:10.090> just<00:03:10.269> a<00:03:10.329> big<00:03:10.510> word<00:03:10.689> for

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
which is really just a big word for

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.929 
which is really just a big word for
saying<00:03:11.230> that<00:03:11.379> it<00:03:11.469> starts<00:03:11.829> out<00:03:12.010> very<00:03:12.069> gel<00:03:12.670> light

00:03:12.929 --> 00:03:12.939 
saying that it starts out very gel light

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:15.300 
saying that it starts out very gel light
but<00:03:13.180> as<00:03:13.420> I<00:03:13.780> push<00:03:14.019> it<00:03:14.170> around<00:03:14.260> and<00:03:14.739> I<00:03:14.799> manipulate

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
but as I push it around and I manipulate

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.100 
but as I push it around and I manipulate
it<00:03:15.459> here<00:03:15.790> it<00:03:16.060> starts<00:03:16.329> to<00:03:16.390> become<00:03:16.480> much<00:03:16.959> much

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
it here it starts to become much much

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.979 
it here it starts to become much much
more<00:03:17.290> fluid<00:03:17.680> and<00:03:18.269> that's<00:03:19.269> kind<00:03:19.599> of<00:03:19.719> nice

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
more fluid and that's kind of nice

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:24.119 
more fluid and that's kind of nice
because<00:03:20.640> when<00:03:21.640> I'm<00:03:21.790> brushing<00:03:22.120> it<00:03:22.480> out<00:03:22.659> and<00:03:23.129> I

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:24.129 
because when I'm brushing it out and I

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:26.610 
because when I'm brushing it out and I
have<00:03:24.340> my<00:03:24.400> canvas<00:03:24.969> vertically<00:03:25.599> what<00:03:26.439> will

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
have my canvas vertically what will

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.949 
have my canvas vertically what will
happen<00:03:27.040> is<00:03:27.340> it<00:03:27.579> won't<00:03:27.760> drip<00:03:28.090> down<00:03:28.269> the<00:03:28.329> surface

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
happen is it won't drip down the surface

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.500 
happen is it won't drip down the surface
so<00:03:29.260> I<00:03:29.530> can<00:03:29.890> take<00:03:30.129> this<00:03:30.310> here<00:03:30.609> brush<00:03:31.150> out<00:03:31.329> some

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
so I can take this here brush out some

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.990 
so I can take this here brush out some
beautiful<00:03:31.629> marks<00:03:32.200> here<00:03:32.409> and<00:03:33.189> I<00:03:33.609> can<00:03:33.730> get<00:03:33.849> into

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
beautiful marks here and I can get into

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.630 
beautiful marks here and I can get into
a<00:03:34.120> lot<00:03:34.329> of<00:03:34.359> blending<00:03:35.200> and<00:03:35.379> glazing<00:03:35.709> and<00:03:36.370> it'll

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
a lot of blending and glazing and it'll

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.520 
a lot of blending and glazing and it'll
dry<00:03:36.819> to<00:03:36.879> a<00:03:37.030> very<00:03:37.299> nice<00:03:37.420> gloss<00:03:37.750> finish<00:03:38.140> the

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
dry to a very nice gloss finish the

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.170 
dry to a very nice gloss finish the
other<00:03:38.709> thing<00:03:38.859> I<00:03:38.950> should<00:03:38.980> mention<00:03:39.310> as<00:03:39.609> well<00:03:39.819> is

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
other thing I should mention as well is

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.660 
other thing I should mention as well is
that<00:03:40.840> the<00:03:41.079> liquid<00:03:41.590> family<00:03:42.069> of<00:03:42.159> mediums<00:03:42.519> now

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
that the liquid family of mediums now

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.819 
that the liquid family of mediums now
comes<00:03:42.939> in<00:03:43.090> plastic<00:03:43.599> bottles<00:03:43.930> which<00:03:44.469> is<00:03:44.590> great

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:44.829 
comes in plastic bottles which is great

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:47.009 
comes in plastic bottles which is great
particularly<00:03:45.280> for<00:03:45.400> colleges<00:03:45.909> where<00:03:46.870> they

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
particularly for colleges where they

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:48.959 
particularly for colleges where they
don't<00:03:47.200> want<00:03:47.379> breakage<00:03:47.829> in<00:03:48.010> the<00:03:48.099> studio<00:03:48.459> with

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:48.969 
don't want breakage in the studio with

00:03:48.969 --> 00:03:53.069 
don't want breakage in the studio with
the<00:03:49.180> old<00:03:49.480> glass<00:03:49.689> bottles<00:03:51.450> liquid<00:03:52.450> like<00:03:52.599> gel<00:03:52.870> is

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:53.079 
the old glass bottles liquid like gel is

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:56.220 
the old glass bottles liquid like gel is
similar<00:03:53.469> to<00:03:53.709> liquid<00:03:54.099> fine<00:03:54.310> detail<00:03:54.849> but<00:03:55.750> it's

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
similar to liquid fine detail but it's

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.619 
similar to liquid fine detail but it's
obviously<00:03:56.950> a<00:03:57.010> gel<00:03:57.489> like<00:03:57.700> consistency<00:03:57.879> and

00:03:58.619 --> 00:03:58.629 
obviously a gel like consistency and

00:03:58.629 --> 00:03:59.759 
obviously a gel like consistency and
that's<00:03:58.810> nice<00:03:59.019> because<00:03:59.260> I<00:03:59.349> have<00:03:59.469> so<00:03:59.680> many

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
that's nice because I have so many

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:01.709 
that's nice because I have so many
subtle<00:04:00.129> passages<00:04:00.879> in<00:04:01.030> this<00:04:01.150> portrait<00:04:01.599> of

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:01.719 
subtle passages in this portrait of

00:04:01.719 --> 00:04:03.420 
subtle passages in this portrait of
different<00:04:02.109> colors<00:04:02.469> that<00:04:02.499> I<00:04:02.709> wanted<00:04:03.040> to<00:04:03.129> blend

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
different colors that I wanted to blend

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.220 
different colors that I wanted to blend
wet<00:04:03.730> into<00:04:03.999> wet<00:04:04.209> and<00:04:04.420> the<00:04:04.840> gel<00:04:05.049> like

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
wet into wet and the gel like

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.530 
wet into wet and the gel like
consistency<00:04:05.379> keeps<00:04:06.219> it<00:04:06.400> from<00:04:06.670> running<00:04:06.909> or

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
consistency keeps it from running or

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:08.699 
consistency keeps it from running or
dripping<00:04:07.870> down<00:04:08.019> the<00:04:08.079> painting<00:04:08.499> as<00:04:08.590> I'm

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
dripping down the painting as I'm

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:09.239 
dripping down the painting as I'm
working

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:09.249 
working

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:11.429 
working
liquid<00:04:09.939> impasto<00:04:10.450> has<00:04:10.689> a<00:04:10.719> very<00:04:11.170> stiff

00:04:11.429 --> 00:04:11.439 
liquid impasto has a very stiff

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:12.869 
liquid impasto has a very stiff
consistency<00:04:12.010> which<00:04:12.159> is<00:04:12.189> why<00:04:12.370> it<00:04:12.459> comes<00:04:12.609> in<00:04:12.819> a

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:12.879 
consistency which is why it comes in a

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:15.209 
consistency which is why it comes in a
tube<00:04:13.090> so<00:04:13.329> it<00:04:13.390> can<00:04:13.510> be<00:04:13.599> squeezed<00:04:13.930> out<00:04:14.170> and<00:04:14.439> it'll

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:15.219 
tube so it can be squeezed out and it'll

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:17.190 
tube so it can be squeezed out and it'll
retain<00:04:15.489> its<00:04:15.700> texture<00:04:16.180> and<00:04:16.299> its<00:04:16.600> brush<00:04:16.900> strokes

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
retain its texture and its brush strokes

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.840 
retain its texture and its brush strokes
as<00:04:17.380> well<00:04:17.410> and<00:04:17.799> the<00:04:18.130> brush<00:04:18.340> strokes<00:04:18.609> will

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
as well and the brush strokes will

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.779 
as well and the brush strokes will
retain<00:04:19.120> these<00:04:19.900> crisp<00:04:20.350> high<00:04:20.680> peaks<00:04:21.130> so<00:04:21.579> I<00:04:21.639> can

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:21.789 
retain these crisp high peaks so I can

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:24.480 
retain these crisp high peaks so I can
take<00:04:22.030> up<00:04:22.270> take<00:04:22.870> some<00:04:23.050> paint<00:04:23.259> here<00:04:23.380> some<00:04:24.280> color

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
take up take some paint here some color

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.570 
take up take some paint here some color
and<00:04:25.229> mix<00:04:26.229> that<00:04:26.440> right<00:04:26.740> into<00:04:27.130> it

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
and mix that right into it

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.400 
and mix that right into it
you<00:04:27.759> can<00:04:27.910> see<00:04:28.030> already<00:04:28.270> how<00:04:28.539> that<00:04:28.690> adds<00:04:28.870> volume

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
you can see already how that adds volume

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.469 
you can see already how that adds volume
to<00:04:29.590> the<00:04:29.680> paint<00:04:29.949> and<00:04:30.160> it'll<00:04:31.090> also<00:04:31.210> stay

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:31.479 
to the paint and it'll also stay

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:33.809 
to the paint and it'll also stay
workable<00:04:31.990> for<00:04:32.319> several<00:04:32.830> hours<00:04:33.130> but<00:04:33.370> what's

00:04:33.809 --> 00:04:33.819 
workable for several hours but what's

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:36.029 
workable for several hours but what's
amazing<00:04:34.090> to<00:04:34.449> me<00:04:34.479> about<00:04:34.870> it<00:04:35.110> is<00:04:35.289> that<00:04:35.770> you<00:04:35.889> can

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:36.039 
amazing to me about it is that you can

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:38.159 
amazing to me about it is that you can
see<00:04:36.310> how<00:04:36.880> very<00:04:36.910> very<00:04:37.360> thick<00:04:37.599> it<00:04:37.780> is

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:38.169 
see how very very thick it is

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:40.890 
see how very very thick it is
yeah<00:04:38.650> it'll<00:04:38.979> start<00:04:39.220> to<00:04:39.310> set<00:04:39.520> up<00:04:39.669> within<00:04:40.660> a<00:04:40.750> day

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
yeah it'll start to set up within a day

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.499 
yeah it'll start to set up within a day
or<00:04:40.930> so

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:42.509 
or so

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:44.879 
or so
liquid<00:04:43.509> impasto<00:04:43.930> is<00:04:44.050> great<00:04:44.349> when<00:04:44.560> you<00:04:44.650> want<00:04:44.770> to

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:44.889 
liquid impasto is great when you want to

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:47.159 
liquid impasto is great when you want to
achieve<00:04:44.979> thick<00:04:45.699> rich<00:04:45.940> impasto<00:04:46.539> brush<00:04:46.810> marks

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:47.169 
achieve thick rich impasto brush marks

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:53.400 
achieve thick rich impasto brush marks
they<00:04:47.349> keep<00:04:47.530> their<00:04:47.680> crisp<00:04:47.949> texture<00:04:52.410> liquid

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 
they keep their crisp texture liquid

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.559 
they keep their crisp texture liquid
olio<00:04:53.650> pasta<00:04:54.220> also<00:04:54.490> comes<00:04:54.880> in<00:04:55.030> a<00:04:55.090> two<00:04:55.270> but<00:04:55.479> it

00:04:55.559 --> 00:04:55.569 
olio pasta also comes in a two but it

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:57.870 
olio pasta also comes in a two but it
looks<00:04:55.750> similar<00:04:56.289> however<00:04:56.979> the<00:04:57.310> difference<00:04:57.729> is

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
looks similar however the difference is

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.460 
looks similar however the difference is
that<00:04:57.940> it's<00:04:58.240> going<00:04:58.389> to<00:04:58.509> drive<00:04:58.690> to<00:04:58.840> a<00:04:58.870> semi<00:04:59.169> matte

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
that it's going to drive to a semi matte

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.129 
that it's going to drive to a semi matte
finish<00:05:00.000> and<00:05:01.000> I'll<00:05:01.150> mix<00:05:01.360> in<00:05:01.569> the<00:05:01.690> color<00:05:01.900> here

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:02.139 
finish and I'll mix in the color here

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:04.110 
finish and I'll mix in the color here
again<00:05:02.380> a<00:05:02.409> little<00:05:02.590> bit<00:05:02.710> and<00:05:03.669> that's<00:05:03.819> different

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
again a little bit and that's different

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.149 
again a little bit and that's different
than<00:05:04.599> the<00:05:04.870> other<00:05:04.960> liquid<00:05:05.380> medium<00:05:05.740> it's<00:05:05.979> gonna

00:05:06.149 --> 00:05:06.159 
than the other liquid medium it's gonna

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:08.370 
than the other liquid medium it's gonna
dry<00:05:06.400> more<00:05:06.699> quickly<00:05:07.060> and<00:05:07.449> it's<00:05:07.990> gonna<00:05:08.139> thicken

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
dry more quickly and it's gonna thicken

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:13.740 
dry more quickly and it's gonna thicken
rapidly<00:05:09.220> and<00:05:09.509> the<00:05:10.509> brushstrokes<00:05:12.750> although

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
rapidly and the brushstrokes although

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.499 
rapidly and the brushstrokes although
very<00:05:14.020> thick<00:05:14.470> will<00:05:15.009> level<00:05:15.400> out<00:05:15.580> and<00:05:15.940> that's

00:05:16.499 --> 00:05:16.509 
very thick will level out and that's

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:18.689 
very thick will level out and that's
different<00:05:16.780> than<00:05:16.990> the<00:05:17.380> liquid<00:05:18.099> and<00:05:18.190> pasta

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:18.699 
different than the liquid and pasta

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:20.790 
different than the liquid and pasta
whereas<00:05:19.090> the<00:05:19.270> liquid<00:05:19.630> impasto<00:05:20.199> is<00:05:20.530> gonna

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
whereas the liquid impasto is gonna

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.510 
whereas the liquid impasto is gonna
retain<00:05:21.159> the<00:05:21.400> crisp<00:05:21.819> high<00:05:22.750> peaks<00:05:23.280> but<00:05:24.280> look<00:05:24.400> an

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 
retain the crisp high peaks but look an

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.020 
retain the crisp high peaks but look an
oligo<00:05:24.789> pasta<00:05:25.210> will<00:05:25.330> level<00:05:25.630> out<00:05:25.720> a<00:05:25.780> bit<00:05:26.050> more<00:05:26.319> so

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.030 
oligo pasta will level out a bit more so

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:32.040 
oligo pasta will level out a bit more so
have<00:05:28.030> this<00:05:28.150> beautiful<00:05:28.509> thick<00:05:29.400> texture<00:05:31.050> liquid

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 
only old pasta is similar to liquid

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.670 
only old pasta is similar to liquid
impasto<00:05:34.389> and<00:05:34.599> that'll<00:05:34.870> leave<00:05:35.080> very<00:05:35.320> thick
