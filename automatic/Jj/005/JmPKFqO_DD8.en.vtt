the<00:00:00.510> big<00:00:00.719> guiding<00:00:00.989> question<00:00:01.319> that<00:00:01.439> we<00:00:01.530> had<00:00:01.709> was

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
the big guiding question that we had was

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.230 
the big guiding question that we had was
we<00:00:01.979> were<00:00:02.070> trying<00:00:02.310> to<00:00:02.340> figure<00:00:02.550> out<00:00:02.760> whether<00:00:03.000> the

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
we were trying to figure out whether the

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.710 
we were trying to figure out whether the
Crusades<00:00:03.720> were<00:00:03.990> a<00:00:04.259> political<00:00:04.830> war<00:00:05.279> or<00:00:05.580> a

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:05.720 
Crusades were a political war or a

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.760 
Crusades were a political war or a
religious<00:00:06.720> war<00:00:06.899> and<00:00:07.230> you<00:00:07.319> had<00:00:07.500> three

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
religious war and you had three

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.129 
religious war and you had three
religions<00:00:08.220> that<00:00:08.429> we've<00:00:08.580> looked<00:00:08.760> at<00:00:09.139> Judaism

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
religions that we've looked at Judaism

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.209 
religions that we've looked at Judaism
Christianity<00:00:10.380> and<00:00:11.509> Islam<00:00:12.679> we<00:00:13.679> brought<00:00:13.980> in

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
Christianity and Islam we brought in

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:20.150 
Christianity and Islam we brought in
vocabulary<00:00:14.880> words<00:00:15.650> from<00:00:17.029> Islam<00:00:18.050> from<00:00:19.160> Judaism

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
vocabulary words from Islam from Judaism

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.980 
vocabulary words from Islam from Judaism
we<00:00:20.730> brought<00:00:21.000> all<00:00:21.270> of<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.689> different

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
we brought all of the different

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.630 
we brought all of the different
perspectives<00:00:22.500> together<00:00:22.740> so<00:00:23.369> was<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.609> first

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
perspectives together so was the first

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.460 
perspectives together so was the first
thing<00:00:23.970> they<00:00:24.119> had<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.330> do<00:00:24.570> is<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:24.960> sort<00:00:25.289> their

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
thing they had to do is to sort their

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.070 
thing they had to do is to sort their
vocabulary<00:00:26.099> words<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:26.550> their<00:00:26.640> pictures<00:00:27.060> in<00:00:27.570> a

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
vocabulary words and their pictures in a

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.529 
vocabulary words and their pictures in a
way<00:00:28.230> that<00:00:28.410> made<00:00:28.560> sense<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.920> them<00:00:29.420> after<00:00:30.420> they

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
way that made sense to them after they

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.569 
way that made sense to them after they
have<00:00:30.720> sorted<00:00:31.080> them<00:00:31.320> then<00:00:31.830> they<00:00:32.040> needed<00:00:32.399> to

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
have sorted them then they needed to

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.970 
have sorted them then they needed to
create<00:00:32.840> connections<00:00:33.840> between<00:00:33.960> them<00:00:34.559> so<00:00:34.860> they

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
create connections between them so they

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.130 
create connections between them so they
would<00:00:35.130> take<00:00:35.280> strips<00:00:35.550> of<00:00:35.730> paper<00:00:35.960> make<00:00:36.960> them

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
would take strips of paper make them

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.400 
would take strips of paper make them
into<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.469> arrows<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:38.219> show<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:38.969> flow<00:00:39.540> of<00:00:39.870> how

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
into the arrows to show the flow of how

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.900 
into the arrows to show the flow of how
I<00:00:40.440> would<00:00:40.770> read<00:00:41.040> it<00:00:41.070> once<00:00:41.430> they<00:00:41.640> make<00:00:41.879> a

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
I would read it once they make a

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.520 
I would read it once they make a
connection<00:00:42.570> you<00:00:42.870> have<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.230> show<00:00:43.379> the

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
connection you have to show the

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.959 
connection you have to show the
direction<00:00:43.980> of<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.190> flow<00:00:44.399> of<00:00:44.579> it<00:00:44.760> and

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
direction of the flow of it and

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.850 
direction of the flow of it and
everything<00:00:45.809> had<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.020> be<00:00:46.260> connected<00:00:46.530> to

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
everything had to be connected to

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.590 
everything had to be connected to
something<00:00:47.250> else<00:00:49.550> they're<00:00:50.550> using<00:00:51.239> all<00:00:51.360> four

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
something else they're using all four

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.290 
something else they're using all four
methods<00:00:51.989> of<00:00:52.350> thinking<00:00:53.039> because<00:00:53.460> when<00:00:54.149> they

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
methods of thinking because when they

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.720 
methods of thinking because when they
start<00:00:54.660> they're<00:00:55.350> looking<00:00:55.829> at<00:00:56.010> what<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:56.370> is<00:00:56.399> and

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
start they're looking at what it is and

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:57.950 
start they're looking at what it is and
what<00:00:56.789> it<00:00:56.940> isn't<00:00:57.120> when<00:00:57.420> they're<00:00:57.570> doing<00:00:57.750> their

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
what it isn't when they're doing their

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.920 
what it isn't when they're doing their
sorts<00:00:58.379> they're<00:00:59.340> looking<00:00:59.940> at<00:01:00.210> when<00:01:00.809> they're

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
sorts they're looking at when they're

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.630 
sorts they're looking at when they're
making<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.350> concept<00:01:01.829> map<00:01:02.010> you've<00:01:02.370> got<00:01:02.550> an

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
making the concept map you've got an

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.299 
making the concept map you've got an
entire<00:01:02.940> system<00:01:03.530> the<00:01:04.530> fact<00:01:04.799> that<00:01:04.890> we<00:01:05.100> brought

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
entire system the fact that we brought

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.770 
entire system the fact that we brought
in<00:01:05.460> all<00:01:05.549> of<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.850> different<00:01:06.180> things<00:01:06.240> you've

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
in all of the different things you've

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.740 
in all of the different things you've
got<00:01:07.020> your<00:01:07.290> different<00:01:07.680> perspectives<00:01:08.369> so<00:01:09.210> it

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
got your different perspectives so it

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.240 
got your different perspectives so it
just<00:01:09.960> really<00:01:10.320> gets<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.950> whole<00:01:11.220> thing

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
just really gets the whole thing

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.350 
just really gets the whole thing
together

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
together

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.940 
together
they're<00:01:12.600> working<00:01:12.990> together<00:01:13.170> they're<00:01:13.560> talking

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
they're working together they're talking

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.609 
they're working together they're talking
together<00:01:14.280> they<00:01:14.490> have<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.850> negotiate<00:01:15.619> everyone

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
together they have to negotiate everyone

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.730 
together they have to negotiate everyone
can<00:01:16.830> look<00:01:17.100> at<00:01:17.280> what<00:01:17.430> their<00:01:17.670> group<00:01:17.939> did<00:01:18.299> and

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
can look at what their group did and

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.440 
can look at what their group did and
compare<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:20.040> another<00:01:20.310> group<00:01:20.640> so<00:01:21.060> even

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
compare it to another group so even

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.080 
compare it to another group so even
someone<00:01:21.780> who<00:01:21.930> may<00:01:22.229> not<00:01:22.380> have<00:01:22.439> understood<00:01:23.090> what

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
someone who may not have understood what

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.370 
someone who may not have understood what
they<00:01:24.240> were<00:01:24.270> doing<00:01:24.659> in<00:01:24.750> their<00:01:24.869> group<00:01:25.110> right

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
they were doing in their group right

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.679 
they were doing in their group right
away<00:01:25.619> they're<00:01:26.280> seeing<00:01:26.580> it<00:01:26.790> from<00:01:27.090> three<00:01:27.450> or

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
away they're seeing it from three or

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.260 
away they're seeing it from three or
four<00:01:27.960> different<00:01:28.320> perspectives<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:29.250> by<00:01:30.060> that

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
four different perspectives and by that

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.810 
four different perspectives and by that
time<00:01:30.600> they've<00:01:31.110> got<00:01:31.320> an<00:01:31.439> observation<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.400> if

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
time they've got an observation and if

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.340 
time they've got an observation and if
they<00:01:32.970> have<00:01:33.180> an<00:01:33.329> observation<00:01:33.659> they<00:01:34.170> can

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
they have an observation they can

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.170 
they have an observation they can
contribute<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.890> what<00:01:35.189> we're<00:01:35.340> doing<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.850> then

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
contribute to what we're doing and then

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.710 
contribute to what we're doing and then
they<00:01:36.360> so<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:37.200> really<00:01:37.650> it's<00:01:38.400> scaffolding<00:01:39.119> it

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
they so it really it's scaffolding it

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.660 
they so it really it's scaffolding it
really<00:01:40.110> gives<00:01:40.290> them<00:01:40.439> that<00:01:40.619> scaffold<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.369> feel

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
really gives them that scaffold to feel

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.910 
really gives them that scaffold to feel
comfortable<00:01:42.180> in<00:01:42.390> what<00:01:42.570> they're<00:01:42.720> doing<00:01:45.920> when

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
comfortable in what they're doing when

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:47.500 
comfortable in what they're doing when
you're

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.510 
you're

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:48.790 
you're
putting<00:01:47.750> the<00:01:47.870> words<00:01:48.080> up<00:01:48.290> there<00:01:48.320> and<00:01:48.680> you're

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
putting the words up there and you're

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.380 
putting the words up there and you're
just<00:01:49.040> making<00:01:49.340> a<00:01:49.430> connection<00:01:49.700> oh<00:01:50.000> I<00:01:50.060> can

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
just making a connection oh I can

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.560 
just making a connection oh I can
connect<00:01:50.720> this<00:01:50.960> with<00:01:51.260> this<00:01:51.850> that<00:01:52.850> doesn't<00:01:53.330> show

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
connect this with this that doesn't show

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:04.730 
what is that level of thinking and where

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:06.490 
what is that level of thinking and where
are<00:02:04.850> we<00:02:04.910> going<00:02:04.970> with<00:02:05.360> it<00:02:05.420> when<00:02:06.080> they<00:02:06.230> have<00:02:06.470> to

are we going with it when they have to
make<00:02:06.800> those<00:02:06.950> connections<00:02:07.190> I<00:02:07.700> can<00:02:08.030> tell<00:02:08.330> what

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570 
make those connections I can tell what

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.120 
make those connections I can tell what
level<00:02:08.869> of<00:02:08.930> thinking<00:02:09.320> they<00:02:09.440> are<00:02:09.470> and<00:02:09.860> I<00:02:09.920> can

level of thinking they are and I can

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.740 
level of thinking they are and I can
tell<00:02:10.369> what<00:02:10.640> it<00:02:10.760> is<00:02:10.790> that<00:02:11.180> they've<00:02:11.390> brought<00:02:11.720> out

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750

and<00:02:12.080> that's<00:02:12.230> the<00:02:12.380> one<00:02:12.530> thing<00:02:12.710> that<00:02:12.770> I<00:02:12.890> tell<00:02:13.190> my

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
and that's the one thing that I tell my

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.520 
and that's the one thing that I tell my
kids<00:02:13.610> I<00:02:13.850> can't<00:02:14.480> see<00:02:14.630> inside<00:02:14.750> your<00:02:15.020> brains<00:02:15.260> you

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
kids I can't see inside your brains you

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.770 
kids I can't see inside your brains you
have<00:02:16.040> to<00:02:16.190> share<00:02:16.460> your<00:02:16.520> thinking<00:02:17.210> with<00:02:17.360> me<00:02:17.570> and

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
have to share your thinking with me and

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.660 
have to share your thinking with me and
that's<00:02:18.260> how<00:02:18.410> we<00:02:18.560> will<00:02:18.830> create<00:02:19.070> more<00:02:19.340> knowledge

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
that's how we will create more knowledge

because<00:03:15.080> if<00:03:15.230> I<00:03:15.350> can<00:03:15.560> give<00:03:15.739> him<00:03:15.769> those<00:03:16.070> concrete

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
because if I can give him those concrete

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.699 
because if I can give him those concrete
steps<00:03:17.090> so<00:03:17.690> that<00:03:17.840> he<00:03:18.019> can<00:03:18.200> develop<00:03:18.680> that

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
steps so that he can develop that

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.740 
steps so that he can develop that
internal<00:03:19.430> dialogue<00:03:19.850> that<00:03:20.060> he<00:03:20.239> doesn't<00:03:20.570> have

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
internal dialogue that he doesn't have

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.140 
internal dialogue that he doesn't have
on<00:03:20.780> his<00:03:21.200> own<00:03:21.410> now<00:03:22.220> I<00:03:22.250> have<00:03:22.640> an<00:03:22.760> internal

on his own now I have an internal

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.750 
on his own now I have an internal
dialogue<00:03:23.630> to<00:03:23.840> give<00:03:24.050> him<00:03:24.260> I<00:03:24.290> have<00:03:24.560> a<00:03:24.590> script<00:03:25.160> so

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
dialogue to give him I have a script so

they alike how are they different do

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.370 
they alike how are they different do
they<00:03:31.250> belong<00:03:31.550> in<00:03:31.610> a<00:03:31.850> system<00:03:32.239> together<00:03:32.420> how<00:03:33.320> do

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
they belong in a system together how do

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:34.630 
they belong in a system together how do
they<00:03:33.620> look<00:03:33.890> at<00:03:34.070> each<00:03:34.130> other

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
can give him a dialogue so now he's not

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.140

questions<00:03:41.600> he<00:03:41.780> can<00:03:41.810> ask<00:03:42.170> himself<00:03:42.410> when<00:03:42.860> he<00:03:43.010> is

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
questions he can ask himself when he is

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.949 
questions he can ask himself when he is
looking<00:03:43.459> at<00:03:43.580> two<00:03:43.700> different<00:03:44.060> things<00:03:44.209> or<00:03:44.780> when

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
he is approaching a problem and that's

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.160
