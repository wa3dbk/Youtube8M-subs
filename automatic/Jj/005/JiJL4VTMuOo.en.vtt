00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:07.919
 hello everyone with you turbo hedgehog in this 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.860
 I'll tell you a video about a very 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.290
 interesting mod Minecraft 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:16.070
 He is called pixelmon or pokemon 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:20.820
 he adds to the game more than 200 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:25.019
 pokemon and 50 different types of attacks but how 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.510
 I understood from the description of the essence of this 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.060
 fashion is to pump 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.679
 your pokemon that's how not only created 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.579
 the world gives me the opportunity to choose 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:38.370
 pokemon here from these there actually i 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.010
 Pokemon watched for a long time and look for 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:45.719
 I only know that the fireman 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:50.940
 spit pokemonchik and where pikachu pikachu 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:52.140
 there is no take the shamander so we appeared 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.090
 snow biome 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.280
 The fact is that in this game, it's crap 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:01.430
 all kinds of little animals 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:04.650
 here they are as you see in my kind 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:09.240
 I do not know what the hell 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:11.430
 oh shalashik see strange hut well 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.400
 okay fuck with him went to look for Pokemon 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.729
 and so the point of the game is to 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.430
 pump his pokemon he comprehended a 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:22.380
 I'll kill them for now 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.040
 you can not kill with your hand you need to kill 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.360
 Only pokemon here these little animals network 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:34.340
 let's we have him pokemon trash 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:34.340
 so our so come on 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.630
 doesn't want to fight 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.000
 there is 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:49.460
 fight is already a fight and choose the option 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.400
 attacks well let's get here first don't know a little 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:55.940
 it is 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:02:00.370
 chermander beat fight again let's 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.370
 second attack now we kill him 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.260
 fight 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.260
 once again 1 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.030
 so we soaked 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:18.260
 and it turned out two feathers so with 

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:23.060
 chermander manchus doc whether they are alive 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:24.769
 he saves lives and since we saw 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.079
 just soaked another pokemon 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:29.629
 got for it two stinky some 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:33.230
 a feather and still my charmander suffered 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:40.159
 here is another pokemon but still revels 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:45.469
 I was called to fight will have to take 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:47.750
 him so giving such a charmander this 

00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:49.459
 fight here is an attack option 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:55.209
 choose the first because along the way 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:55.209
 more powerful so than the chermander won that 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:59.139
 where is my drop 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.860
 and they are not he does not need to hold on 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.640
 away from these pokemon 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.500
 or else my chicco charmander will be killed but 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.710
 the point is what's about the ondar check from 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.510
 time can be so huge 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:19.230
 grow it to pump only 5 level 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:23.460
 help us 20 50 what lovers and not 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:25.260
 I know how the maximum is here so well 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:28.590
 The main joke of this game is that their 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:32.220
 PokÃ©mon burial in different species here 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:35.100
 different size levels it's just like 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:38.130
 I do not know how a live zoo is who is a fan 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:41.220
 pokemon and my mod will love here 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:46.020
 In fact, this is not a new one, let's say 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:48.120
 he has been in existence for a year 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.950
 so it is refined and practically 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.010
 everything works here 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.360
 There are several new craft how to create 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.930
 any pokeballs 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:59.970
 and so on in general a nice mod to me 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.550
 personally so-so he seemed 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.650
 but a Pokemon fan of his time he was 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:08.040
 I liked it when I looked very 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:12.120
 active pokemon so here so 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:14.790
 review pixelmon mod and pokemon with you 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.360
