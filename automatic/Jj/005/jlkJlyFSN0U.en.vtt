00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.769
 maybe that way 

00:00:01.769 --> 00:00:04.060
 because we formulate 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:06.200
 you understand must not be bored 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.500
 face to this important mandate of treasurer christian we can 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.010
 change if these reinforcements this one I was more scared if I see that I the 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:15.589
 leave a little bit 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:18.340
 will he be the right-hander who bother me so many missions in the introduction 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.340
 because I was the recession in the introduction 

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:26.119
 for defection from the moment we have effects of what it wants 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:28.499
 say that the group of that time places 

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:30.310
 1 2 3 4 5 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:31.769
 at the time of your place 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.550
 and there we can flex 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.250
 because the referee will not order as much as possible 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.360
 that undergoes their making 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.140
 normally it's like that 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.080
 I do not speak of the arbitration year normally it is defined like that 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.960
 because we put up red 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.960
 I want to tell you right away this gift that is a running movement that 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.080
 should not result in this imbalance 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.250
 complete file is always a touch all together 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.370
 in fact pity the substitutes trying to replace the novel is a blockage 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.780
 rest of the report 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.360
 and in March sounds more 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.590
 thereafter we will say stop for the match 5 more the link of the tour 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.440
 to meet together 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.440
 a little guy 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.070
 for their problems I am still alive 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.710
 you like them 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.320
 the first you're not I say was left-handed you're not binding all 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.980
 middle-tier bearings the left-hander must be tied to the inside 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:21.940
 we totally agree 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.820
 I leave your good more than a thing in mind 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.250
 with patrick the penalty 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.250
 mitchell with price votes 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.460
 that's important it's important that the choice not only 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.990
 that all be placed to be in depression 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.990
 point not to work for drawing more than a quarter of a century 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.530
 I went home for 24 hours 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:43.610
 every week 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.390
 the captain 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.730
 but it's for the principle 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:49.830
 we leave you a little more 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:50.719
 that's not all 

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:52.600
 2-0 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.060
 it's not all about rest 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.130
 normally the mayor of Lille had already convinced that the rule 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.860
 a bit for your back skin 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.370
 in the program why 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.420
 as to the chances of not like them that you have not hurt without having the worship 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.280
 second post from behind 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.329
 if you are otherwise you will go through two times 

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:13.329
 as you are obliged to do 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.369
 the Ardennes who is the boss 

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:18.749
 you are the most 

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:22.849
 so we are forced to caucus the dial a little bit toes 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:25.409
 brewers off this balance 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:29.009
 - second line we will continue our balanced trade policy 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:31.389
 it's a little later this year like this
