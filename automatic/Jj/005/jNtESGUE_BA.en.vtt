different<00:01:59.549> shades<00:01:59.939> of<00:02:00.060> glimmer<00:02:00.360> mist<00:02:00.540> down

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
different shades of glimmer mist down

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:01.819 
different shades of glimmer mist down
there<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:00.990> come<00:02:01.140> up<00:02:01.259> with<00:02:01.290> kind<00:02:01.590> of<00:02:01.680> this

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
there to come up with kind of this

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.050 
there to come up with kind of this
metallic<00:02:02.219> look<00:02:02.640> I<00:02:03.079> also<00:02:04.079> did<00:02:04.350> stickles<00:02:05.060> around

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
metallic look I also did stickles around

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.440 
metallic look I also did stickles around
the<00:02:06.180> edge<00:02:06.329> of<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:07.170> acrylic<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:08.060> then<00:02:09.060> I<00:02:09.090> use

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
the edge of the acrylic and then I use

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.080 
the edge of the acrylic and then I use
some<00:02:09.750> tim<00:02:10.289> holtz<00:02:10.530> rock<00:02:10.739> candy<00:02:11.190> and<00:02:11.370> it<00:02:11.790> looks

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
some tim holtz rock candy and it looks

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.250 
some tim holtz rock candy and it looks
just<00:02:12.360> like<00:02:12.510> fraud

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
just like fraud

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.350 
just like fraud
so<00:02:13.620> if<00:02:13.680> you<00:02:13.890> live<00:02:14.400> in<00:02:14.430> a<00:02:14.549> frosty<00:02:14.790> air<00:02:15.090> it<00:02:15.209> looks

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
so if you live in a frosty air it looks

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.330 
so if you live in a frosty air it looks
just<00:02:15.420> like<00:02:15.569> frost<00:02:15.930> on<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.200> windows<00:02:16.650> maybe

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
just like frost on the windows maybe

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.710 
just like frost on the windows maybe
want<00:02:17.579> to<00:02:17.640> just<00:02:17.790> put<00:02:17.970> my<00:02:18.090> tongue<00:02:18.150> on<00:02:18.390> and<00:02:18.569> see<00:02:18.689> if

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
it would stick nice to do that as a kid

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.300 
it would stick nice to do that as a kid
kind<00:02:21.299> of<00:02:21.329> stupid<00:02:21.810> so<00:02:22.110> you<00:02:22.170> lose<00:02:22.470> port<00:02:23.099> to<00:02:23.189> your
