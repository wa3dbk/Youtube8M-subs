the<00:01:54.540> HTC<00:01:54.960> magic<00:01:55.409> I<00:01:55.799> think<00:01:56.189> was<00:01:56.340> one<00:01:56.490> of<00:01:56.610> them

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
the HTC magic I think was one of them

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.990 
the HTC magic I think was one of them
and<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.479> galaxy<00:01:57.960> s<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.829> nexus<00:01:59.189> one<00:01:59.490> all

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
and the galaxy s and the nexus one all

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.999 
and the galaxy s and the nexus one all
the<00:02:00.060> way<00:02:00.270> up<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:00.479> things<00:02:00.810> like<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.079> galaxy<00:02:01.500> s3

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
the way up to things like the galaxy s3

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.340 
the way up to things like the galaxy s3
I<00:02:02.189> don't<00:02:02.520> think<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.759> galaxy<00:02:03.180> s4<00:02:03.659> is<00:02:03.930> on<00:02:04.170> that

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
I don't think the galaxy s4 is on that

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.740 
I don't think the galaxy s4 is on that
list<00:02:04.409> yet<00:02:04.920> but<00:02:05.250> probably<00:02:05.850> will<00:02:06.210> be<00:02:06.360> before<00:02:06.540> too

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
list yet but probably will be before too
