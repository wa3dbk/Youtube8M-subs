00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:06.720
 there speaks dire gurizada all beauty 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.019
 Today I'll show you how I do. 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.490
 I analyze if the processor is good then 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.710
 we have to know if the 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.199
 rotor who will play not so 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.970
 How do I do it? 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:20.220
 first for you to know if you 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.760
 I do not know what your processor is like doing 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:35.610
 one thing that goes there does not search 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:40.680
 on windows and type ms 32 will open the 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:44.340
 windows configuration and processor is 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:47.010
 a doc did not arrive on my new computer 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:52.789
 four days ago, let's see with this 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:57.329
 here 1 and 5.300 in google 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:01:10.670
 we leave the sea here on google and then 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:10.670
 puts this in the case of intel and 5,300 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:24.450
 good benchmark it will appear that 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:30.000
 clicks on the first link appeared 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:35.310
 it may be good he will give a score 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.470
 from my of my processor the pain it has 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.829
 the hiring of 1,500 31 points 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.110
 it's way down for gaming it's not worth it 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.579
 he is bad 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.680
 So what do we have to know more? 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.490
 he can suddenly run the game I 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.130
 I want 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.020
 So we 'll have to see what the 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.759
 minimum configuration to run the 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:02:02.460
 play as an example I took the 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:05.570
 heider 2013 is to have samba to play tomb 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:09.569
 raider a minimum requirement is an intel 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:12.300
 core 2 duo 6,300 by key numbering 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.530
 It 's better for me to see the 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.420
 give a look do not make a comparative 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.150
 huh 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:25.170
 he goes in the bank of a bd mark it 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:27.360
 and also we will open here รณ the 1117 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.420
 punctuation of it means that the 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:37.110
 my 1531 score is better then my 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:39.800
 he plays this game he is not so much better than 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.450
 I although it has a numbering 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:46.320
 superior has been released after my 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:49.830
 better but I do not want to play in the 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.780
 minimum is kind of bland so we 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:03:01.620
 have to see here 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:03:06.170
 the recommended that it is a hotel and five in 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:11.550
 Five people copy it here and go there and 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:16.430
 also companies specializing in testing 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:18.420
 the processors then they test 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.930
 right I do not have 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:25.530
 they win for it we go here 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:30.630
 take a look at this benchmark to run 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:33.540
 that good game a good level even and well 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.370
 right without light without nothing without putting 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.959
 the video card memories first 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.500
 there is then the processor is 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:41.340
 people 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:45.690
 in another video we talk about 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:51.410
 the video card part memory then 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:54.959
 Sir, this is where you can shoot at the most. 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:57.480
 exporter it is worth 3,747 points or 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:04:02.970
 say my computer no longer quotes on 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:06.870
 maximum to run at least 3,747 points 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:08.970
 now if you have a processor do 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.190
 analysis and he gives more than 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.530
 sure it will run hard not 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:18.840
 will vote because this is tested 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:23.840
 So let's say if you have 11 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.840
 with fex ump processor 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:37.350
 4.300 has a 4.300 reflection that is more or 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:40.650
 less with 153 none and five full 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:46.770
 but looks at the score of r 4,780 points 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:50.160
 then that fx 4,300 it has 4760 account is 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:54.270
 an excellent processor will run this 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:59.400
 game will run at maximum with 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:05:02.400
 sure because he asks for 3,700 points 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:05.850
 so this is what you have to do I want to have 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:09.780
 a processor parses it and compares with 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:13.890
 the minimum and maximum requirements 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:21.920
 processor that the game needs here in 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:21.920
 if you invented phenom 2 x 2 here 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:44.010
 came to see what his situation was. 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:47.340
 two thousand and one hundred bridges then amd already 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:49.919
 is slightly different from 2,100 points 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:53.490
 intel was 3 thousand and a few points 

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:56.160
 does this difference and even because of 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:59.460
 processor architectures have a 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:01.760
 but if the difference is its processor 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:06.330
 Intel compared with the intel 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:12.810
 amd compares to amd and so goes 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:14.580
 and test the game and it will work then 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:18.810
 too this is what I wanted to talk to 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:21.780
 you today on the benchmarks of the two 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:23.550
 processors the next time I record 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:26.850
 Something about video card too. 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:31.800
 my knowledge is not absolute 

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:34.060
 I accept constructive criticism of ideas and 

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:37.600
 all knowledge is always welcome 

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:41.470
 so any question asks there what 

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:45.940
 I knew it's the one I help close to the famous 

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:48.700
 video card stabilized memory 

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:52.510
 Anything else asks if he likes the 

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:56.620
 video sharing on social networks 

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:58.780
 click to like write channel 

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:03.400
 and now they will get on the new processor 

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:06.010
 get voted the gameplay also hope 

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:07.600
 that you like and always say the channel 

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:11.430
 and recommends that colleagues 

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:11.430
 earned so thanks a hug
