00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
athletes period use this protocol it's

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:00.139 
athletes period use this protocol it's
hard<00:01:56.500> because<00:01:57.070> it<00:01:57.340> has<00:01:57.490> intensity<00:01:58.149> and<00:01:58.270> volume

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149

initiative<00:02:01.149> protocols<00:02:01.630> one<00:02:02.350> guess<00:02:02.590> you<00:02:02.829> can't

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
initiative protocols one guess you can't

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.010 
initiative protocols one guess you can't
go<00:02:03.189> hard<00:02:03.520> long<00:02:03.850> but<00:02:04.179> this<00:02:04.329> you<00:02:04.479> can<00:02:04.689> because

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
go hard long but this you can because

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.319 
go hard long but this you can because
you<00:02:05.619> see<00:02:05.829> the<00:02:06.219> speed<00:02:06.460> of<00:02:06.549> movement<00:02:06.729> isn't<00:02:06.969> fast

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:07.329 
you see the speed of movement isn't fast

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:10.229 
you see the speed of movement isn't fast
that's<00:02:08.110> how<00:02:08.289> you<00:02:08.349> get<00:02:08.679> more<00:02:08.890> volume<00:02:09.129> Oh<00:02:09.459> while

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
that's how you get more volume Oh while

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:12.330 
that's how you get more volume Oh while
keeping<00:02:10.569> a<00:02:10.690> heavy<00:02:10.869> load<00:02:11.140> or<00:02:11.410> again<00:02:11.920> it's<00:02:12.099> great

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
keeping a heavy load or again it's great

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.910 
keeping a heavy load or again it's great

durable model so if you lease a try

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.960 
durable model so if you lease a try
you're<00:03:05.390> right<00:03:05.570> and<00:03:05.780> they're<00:03:05.930> very<00:03:06.110> hard<00:03:06.470> to

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
you're right and they're very hard to
