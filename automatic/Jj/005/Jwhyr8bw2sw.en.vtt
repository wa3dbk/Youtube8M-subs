fused<00:02:49.459> with<00:02:49.519> the<00:02:49.609> spiders<00:02:50.209> because<00:02:50.390> of<00:02:50.690> the

radioactive spider bite obviously so if

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.259 
radioactive spider bite obviously so if
that's<00:02:55.340> in<00:02:55.609> his<00:02:55.760> DNA

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
that's in his DNA

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:59.319 
that's in his DNA
it<00:02:56.510> can't<00:02:56.750> just<00:02:56.810> be<00:02:57.019> blocked<00:02:58.280> that<00:02:59.030> can't

00:02:59.319 --> 00:02:59.329 
it can't just be blocked that can't

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:02.400 
it can't just be blocked that can't
happen<00:02:59.709> that's<00:03:00.709> not<00:03:00.920> how<00:03:01.190> it<00:03:01.340> works

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
happen that's not how it works
