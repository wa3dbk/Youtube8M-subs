00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.700
 How do you turn a gps support 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.200
 on the stand to place under the 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.420
 I'll show you that you're going 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.790
 need clear support that I do not use 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.010
 more of this pectin here that comes along 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.690
 with the go pro also for you to change her 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.310
 and I'm going to use the pond here. 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:26.580
 Gopro since I 'm filming with her. 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:29.060
 Of course I'm going to take out here and have a screw 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.060
 has a screw 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:37.070
 I'm going to take this piece here and 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.410
 coincidently she has the same in 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.910
 the box here similar to what is used in the 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.700
 the same thing you can see in the 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.920
 video that I'm going to do then get this 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:50.360
 terrible place here put of 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:52.370
 round the screw of rice that is again 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.420
 which is very thin I can take from one side 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.620
 for the other, let's imagine that the 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.570
 The windshield is here 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.550
 If I want to film my route to 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.710
 Where am I going to go in that case? 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:04.879
 I will do will is here O turns to ball 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:07.490
 I fit my pond and it goes 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:12.170
 stay like this I'll put it here in the video 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:17.750
 for you to see how it looks then it would look 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:21.550
 more or less so the staff can 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.550
 You see york in front now. 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.140
 and then you will have the footage in it 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:36.180
 point of view you have been driving 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:39.700
 now if you want to record you will 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.470
 let this part here turn up and 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.060
 again and will now lock the 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.710
 video here to see how it goes now 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.630
 stay here like this to achieve a 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:50.170
 A little higher up to be straight 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.030
 You can see there you can spin from one 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.800
 side to the other, it is also possible that 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.450
 those with a little bass nÃ© 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.340
 stayed a little turned office and 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.570
 saying aside and stayed a little bit 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.820
 face down 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.290
 we can do the same thing as if 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.580
 he was facing forward 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.090
 now I have up to control at the time 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.140
 here it is more up but down 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.179
 if I want to take a little more 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.660
 Down, just loosen the screw here. 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.640
 to generate down to down to top 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.500
 No one here is what you see. 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.510
 on your side and on the other side now 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.950
 Of course if you go through a lot 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.170
 very bumpy obvious that it will 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.670
 shake but overall and looks good on film 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.650
 you can turn from side to side too 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.090
 personal beauty passing heat here in 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.530
 car I hope you have enjoyed this 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.530
 A big hug and see you next time.
