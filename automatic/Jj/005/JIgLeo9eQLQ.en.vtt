00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
his book get out your keto sticks I

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.490 
his book get out your keto sticks I
think<00:00:27.510> he<00:00:27.599> just<00:00:27.810> had<00:00:27.960> an<00:00:28.050> obsession<00:00:28.470> with

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
think he just had an obsession with

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.710 
think he just had an obsession with
people<00:00:28.980> peeing<00:00:29.250> on<00:00:29.490> sticks<00:00:29.880> in<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.210> bathroom

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
people peeing on sticks in the bathroom

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.530 
people peeing on sticks in the bathroom
I'm<00:00:31.650> not<00:00:31.859> exactly<00:00:32.130> sure<00:00:32.340> because<00:00:32.700> keto<00:00:33.510> sticks

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
I'm not exactly sure because keto sticks

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.470 
I'm not exactly sure because keto sticks
are<00:00:33.960> absolutely<00:00:34.410> useless<00:00:34.649> they<00:00:35.640> don't<00:00:36.000> tell

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
are absolutely useless they don't tell

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.319 
are absolutely useless they don't tell
you<00:00:36.840> when<00:00:37.170> you're<00:00:37.380> in<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.559> state<00:00:37.620> of

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 
you when you're in a state of

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:41.030 
you when you're in a state of
ketogenesis<00:00:39.329> which<00:00:40.170> is<00:00:40.320> when<00:00:40.500> your<00:00:40.649> body<00:00:40.800> is

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
ketogenesis which is when your body is

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.040 
ketogenesis which is when your body is
turning<00:00:41.250> fatty<00:00:41.579> acids<00:00:42.030> into<00:00:42.329> ketones<00:00:42.809> and

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
turning fatty acids into ketones and

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.720 
turning fatty acids into ketones and
you're<00:00:43.170> effectively<00:00:43.800> burning<00:00:44.250> fat<00:00:44.489> and

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
you're effectively burning fat and

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.520 
you're effectively burning fat and
you're<00:00:45.239> very<00:00:45.390> inefficient<00:00:46.020> this<00:00:46.140> is<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.320> good

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
you're very inefficient this is a good

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.950 
you're very inefficient this is a good
state<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:46.829> be<00:00:47.070> in<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.370> problem<00:00:47.760> is<00:00:47.960> keto

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
state to be in the problem is keto

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.990 
state to be in the problem is keto
sticks<00:00:48.989> only<00:00:49.469> tell<00:00:49.950> you<00:00:50.070> how<00:00:50.280> many<00:00:50.340> ketones

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
sticks only tell you how many ketones

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.479 
sticks only tell you how many ketones
are<00:00:51.120> coming<00:00:51.510> out<00:00:51.660> through<00:00:52.289> your<00:00:52.500> urine<00:00:52.770> this

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
are coming out through your urine this

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.160 
are coming out through your urine this
could<00:00:53.670> happen<00:00:53.820> for<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.180> number<00:00:54.239> of<00:00:54.570> reasons<00:00:54.780> it

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
could happen for a number of reasons it

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.279 
could happen for a number of reasons it
can<00:00:55.320> happen<00:00:55.530> during<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.760> prep<00:00:57.149> phase<00:00:57.420> of<00:00:57.780> carb

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
can happen during the prep phase of carb

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.250 
can happen during the prep phase of carb
backloading<00:00:58.800> or<00:00:59.280> carb<00:00:59.550> nite<00:00:59.899> it<00:01:00.899> can<00:01:01.079> happen

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
backloading or carb nite it can happen

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.900 
backloading or carb nite it can happen
first<00:01:01.649> thing<00:01:01.890> in<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.039> morning<00:01:02.340> and<00:01:02.489> does<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.879> a

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
first thing in the morning and does to a

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.329 
first thing in the morning and does to a
lot<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.210> people<00:01:03.480> it<00:01:03.690> can<00:01:03.809> happen<00:01:04.559> after<00:01:04.949> a

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
lot of people it can happen after a

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.940 
lot of people it can happen after a
training<00:01:05.729> session<00:01:06.150> but<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.080> can<00:01:07.200> also<00:01:07.500> happen

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
training session but it can also happen

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.250 
training session but it can also happen
if<00:01:08.250> you've<00:01:08.400> been<00:01:08.640> ketogenic<00:01:09.450> all<00:01:09.689> day<00:01:09.960> and

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
if you've been ketogenic all day and

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.620 
if you've been ketogenic all day and
have<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.500> large<00:01:11.010> load<00:01:11.430> of<00:01:11.610> carbohydrates<00:01:12.390> that

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
have a large load of carbohydrates that

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.170 
have a large load of carbohydrates that
large<00:01:13.470> load<00:01:13.799> of<00:01:13.950> glucose<00:01:14.400> creates<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:14.970> surplus

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
large load of glucose creates a surplus

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.570 
large load of glucose creates a surplus
of<00:01:15.570> ketones<00:01:15.990> that<00:01:16.229> your<00:01:16.350> body<00:01:16.650> can't<00:01:17.100> uses

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
of ketones that your body can't uses

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.660 
of ketones that your body can't uses
effectively<00:01:18.180> so<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:18.750> pee<00:01:19.229> them<00:01:19.470> out<00:01:19.650> so<00:01:20.490> in

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
effectively so you pee them out so in

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.789 
effectively so you pee them out so in
that<00:01:20.850> case<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.360> keto<00:01:21.689> sticks<00:01:21.720> actually<00:01:22.439> tell

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
that case the keto sticks actually tell

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.490 
that case the keto sticks actually tell
you<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.009> wrong<00:01:23.340> thing<00:01:23.420> they<00:01:24.420> show<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:24.869> that

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
you the wrong thing they show you that

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.499 
you the wrong thing they show you that
you're<00:01:25.799> in<00:01:25.830> ketosis<00:01:26.310> which<00:01:26.790> is<00:01:26.970> just<00:01:27.180> peeing

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
you're in ketosis which is just peeing

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.990 
you're in ketosis which is just peeing
out<00:01:27.630> ketones<00:01:28.140> but<00:01:28.829> in<00:01:28.950> fact<00:01:29.220> your<00:01:29.460> body<00:01:29.610> is<00:01:29.850> no

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
out ketones but in fact your body is no

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.010 
out ketones but in fact your body is no
longer<00:01:30.079> ketogenic<00:01:31.079> so<00:01:31.710> keto<00:01:32.130> sticks<00:01:32.159> are

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
longer ketogenic so keto sticks are

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.240 
longer ketogenic so keto sticks are
absolutely<00:01:34.020> 100%<00:01:35.780> useless<00:01:36.780> for<00:01:37.650> use<00:01:37.829> on<00:01:38.009> these

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
absolutely 100% useless for use on these

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.069 
absolutely 100% useless for use on these
diets<00:01:38.700> if<00:01:38.850> you're<00:01:39.060> trying<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.450> learn<00:01:39.570> about<00:01:39.840> if
