such<00:02:04.229> people<00:02:04.799> who<00:02:05.009> are<00:02:05.189> so<00:02:05.729> ordinary<00:02:06.570> and

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
such people who are so ordinary and

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.490 
such people who are so ordinary and
we<00:02:07.640> did<00:02:07.789> so<00:02:07.969> much<00:02:08.119> of<00:02:08.390> the<00:02:08.569> lifetime's<00:02:09.140> work

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
we did so much of the lifetime's work

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.190 
we did so much of the lifetime's work
into<00:02:10.489> the<00:02:10.610> society<00:02:11.120> or<00:02:11.360> the<00:02:11.390> communities<00:02:11.959> they

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
into the society or the communities they

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.640 
into the society or the communities they
live<00:02:12.440> in

live in

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.770 
live in
and<00:02:13.220> so<00:02:13.430> I<00:02:13.640> don't<00:02:13.970> think<00:02:14.180> you<00:02:14.360> need<00:02:14.510> to<00:02:14.540> be<00:02:14.750> a

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
and so I don't think you need to be a

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.040 
and so I don't think you need to be a
celebrity<00:02:15.349> to<00:02:15.560> have<00:02:15.739> an<00:02:15.860> impact<00:02:16.280> but<00:02:16.550> yes

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
celebrity to have an impact but yes

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.170 
celebrity to have an impact but yes
having<00:02:18.050> said<00:02:18.260> that<00:02:18.290> it<00:02:18.709> definitely<00:02:19.459> helps<00:02:20.000> the

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
having said that it definitely helps the

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.839 
having said that it definitely helps the
cause<00:02:20.390> initial<00:02:21.260> and<00:02:21.560> any<00:02:21.800> plan<00:02:22.160> that<00:02:22.190> harmony

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:22.849 
cause initial and any plan that harmony

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:24.280 
cause initial and any plan that harmony
hasn't<00:02:23.209> that<00:02:23.300> way<00:02:23.510> to<00:02:23.569> rope<00:02:23.930> in<00:02:24.080> some

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
hasn't that way to rope in some

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.039 
hasn't that way to rope in some
Bollywood<00:02:24.650> celebrities<00:02:25.640> or<00:02:26.239> has<00:02:26.599> done<00:02:26.810> so<00:02:26.959> in

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.199 
shows but I don't think that many
Bollywood<00:02:38.540> actors<00:02:39.230> who<00:02:39.530> who<00:02:40.220> paint<00:02:40.519> Salman
