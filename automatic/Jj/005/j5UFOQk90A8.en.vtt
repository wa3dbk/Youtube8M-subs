00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
these I mean this is um second video for

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.280

Led<00:00:05.520> Zeppelin's<00:00:05.940> fool<00:00:06.270> in<00:00:06.359> the<00:00:06.450> rain<00:00:06.629> first

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
Led Zeppelin's fool in the rain first

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.049 
Led Zeppelin's fool in the rain first
time<00:00:07.470> when<00:00:07.589> we<00:00:07.710> did<00:00:07.859> it<00:00:07.980> in<00:00:08.130> our<00:00:08.429> classes<00:00:08.940> I

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
time when we did it in our classes I

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.060 
time when we did it in our classes I
think<00:00:09.300> we<00:00:09.389> kind<00:00:09.570> of<00:00:09.660> just<00:00:09.809> accounted<00:00:10.290> for<00:00:10.320> to

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
think we kind of just accounted for to

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.129 
think we kind of just accounted for to
make<00:00:11.190> it<00:00:11.280> sound<00:00:11.400> like<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:11.759> actual<00:00:12.120> song<00:00:12.360> with

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
make it sound like the actual song with

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.870 
make it sound like the actual song with
the<00:00:13.290> guitar<00:00:13.650> and<00:00:13.769> everything<00:00:14.130> so<00:00:14.400> we<00:00:14.639> just

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
the guitar and everything so we just

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.560 
the guitar and everything so we just
kind<00:00:15.179> of<00:00:15.210> went<00:00:15.330> right<00:00:15.389> off<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.599> keyboard<00:00:17.570> like

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
kind of went right off the keyboard like

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.960 
kind of went right off the keyboard like
that<00:00:18.779> and<00:00:19.050> I<00:00:19.650> mean<00:00:20.490> that's<00:00:20.580> what<00:00:20.760> he<00:00:20.850> sounds

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
that and I mean that's what he sounds

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.040 
that and I mean that's what he sounds
trying<00:00:21.270> to<00:00:21.330> play<00:00:21.449> with<00:00:21.600> it<00:00:21.720> but<00:00:21.810> I<00:00:21.869> actually

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
trying to play with it but I actually

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.570 
trying to play with it but I actually
went<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.590> Berkeley<00:00:22.890> library<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.519> I<00:00:23.550> got

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
went to the Berkeley library and I got

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.970 
went to the Berkeley library and I got
sheet<00:00:23.939> music<00:00:24.210> for<00:00:24.390> it<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:25.109> so<00:00:25.680> now<00:00:25.710> I'm<00:00:25.859> just

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.380 
sheet music for it and so now I'm just
gonna<00:00:26.070> play<00:00:26.279> it<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.519> way<00:00:26.640> that<00:00:26.670> they<00:00:27.000> wrote<00:00:27.210> it

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
then for the wicked fast part in the

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.220

middle<00:00:37.770> I<00:00:38.120> have<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.660> chords<00:00:39.989> that<00:00:40.110> they're

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
middle I have the chords that they're

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.900 
middle I have the chords that they're
playing<00:00:40.469> I<00:00:40.739> don't<00:00:40.890> know<00:00:41.010> if<00:00:41.100> it's<00:00:41.190> exactly<00:00:41.730> the

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
playing I don't know if it's exactly the

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.600 
playing I don't know if it's exactly the
same<00:00:42.030> works<00:00:42.270> it's<00:00:42.570> so<00:00:42.719> fast<00:00:43.020> but<00:00:43.800> I<00:00:43.980> watch<00:00:44.489> all

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
same works it's so fast but I watch all

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:45.709 
same works it's so fast but I watch all
the<00:00:44.700> videos<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.120> everybody<00:00:45.450> plays<00:00:45.690> a

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
the videos and everybody plays a

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.260 
the videos and everybody plays a
different<00:00:45.840> way<00:00:46.289> so<00:00:46.640> you<00:00:47.640> know<00:00:47.730> whatever<00:00:48.120> as

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
different way so you know whatever as

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.549 
different way so you know whatever as
long<00:00:48.329> as<00:00:48.510> it's<00:00:48.629> good<00:00:48.989> enough<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.170> play<00:00:49.350> along

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
long as it's good enough to play along

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:50.750 
long as it's good enough to play along
with<00:00:49.710> it<00:00:49.800> but<00:00:49.920> this<00:00:50.039> is<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.219> slightly<00:00:50.489> closer

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
with it but this is a slightly closer

00:00:50.760 --> 00:03:00.670 
with it but this is a slightly closer
version<00:00:51.329> I'm<00:00:51.570> going<00:00:51.930> by<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.020> sheet<00:00:52.260> music

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680

Fedorov
and<00:03:11.150> then<00:03:11.300> this<00:03:11.630> is<00:03:11.780> a<00:03:11.840> pacifier<00:03:12.700> so<00:03:13.700> let's

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
and then this is a pacifier so let's

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:15.760 
and then this is a pacifier so let's
tell<00:03:14.600> you<00:03:14.660> what<00:03:14.930> they're<00:03:15.050> playing<00:03:15.170> I<00:03:15.500> know<00:03:15.680> the

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
sheet music will get hard to fine with

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.230 
sheet music will get hard to fine with
what<00:03:18.560> I<00:03:18.590> was<00:03:18.740> playing<00:03:18.950> for<00:03:19.490> that<00:03:19.580> part<00:03:19.880> is<00:03:20.120> just

when it gets to the faster part in the

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.000 
when it gets to the faster part in the
middle<00:03:52.840> this<00:03:53.840> is<00:03:53.900> kind<00:03:54.530> of<00:03:54.560> what<00:03:54.680> the<00:03:54.770> chords

middle this is kind of what the chords
that<00:03:55.100> I'm<00:03:55.250> using<00:03:55.430> I<00:03:55.760> don't<00:03:55.910> know<00:03:56.030> if<00:03:56.090> this<00:03:56.209> is

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:56.240 
that I'm using I don't know if this is

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.690 
that I'm using I don't know if this is
exactly<00:03:56.660> right<00:03:56.900> but<00:03:57.530> it's<00:03:57.890> c<00:03:58.160> e<00:03:58.190> g

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:05.699 
exactly right but it's c e g
i<00:03:58.970> do<00:03:59.450> that<00:03:59.660> twice<00:04:01.480> so<00:04:02.480> a<00:04:02.510> c<00:04:02.810> e<00:04:02.840> g<00:04:03.020> and<00:04:03.920> then<00:04:04.370> cfa

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
i do that twice so a c e g and then cfa

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:09.890 
i do that twice so a c e g and then cfa
twice<00:04:06.430> and<00:04:06.760> then<00:04:06.939> 50gb<00:04:08.189> EAC

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
twice and then 50gb EAC

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.979 
twice and then 50gb EAC
back<00:04:10.900> down<00:04:11.079> to<00:04:11.230> G<00:04:11.409> B<00:04:11.590> D<00:04:11.799> G<00:04:12.040> B<00:04:12.280> and<00:04:12.730> then<00:04:13.150> C<00:04:13.450> if<00:04:13.840> a

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
back down to G B D G B and then C if a

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:17.780 
back down to G B D G B and then C if a
again

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.240 

and<00:04:18.570> it's<00:04:18.900> soft<00:04:19.140> but<00:04:19.260> I<00:04:19.380> kind<00:04:19.920> of<00:04:19.950> think<00:04:20.070> that's

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
and it's soft but I kind of think that's

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:38.590 
and it's soft but I kind of think that's
when<00:04:20.370> they're<00:04:20.490> playing<00:04:23.420> this<00:04:24.420> is<00:04:24.570> that<00:04:24.750> part

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.710 

so<00:04:39.670> that's<00:04:40.670> kind<00:04:40.970> of<00:04:41.060> chords<00:04:41.360> that<00:04:41.510> they<00:04:41.600> have

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
so that's kind of chords that they have

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.600 
so that's kind of chords that they have
the<00:04:41.900> sheet<00:04:42.050> music<00:04:42.140> it<00:04:43.130> might<00:04:43.280> not<00:04:43.400> be<00:04:43.490> perfect

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
the sheet music it might not be perfect

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.130 
the sheet music it might not be perfect
but<00:04:43.850> at<00:04:44.120> least<00:04:44.210> it's<00:04:44.510> closer<00:04:44.780> and<00:04:44.990> you<00:04:45.050> can

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:45.140 
but at least it's closer and you can

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.660 
but at least it's closer and you can
play<00:04:45.260> along<00:04:45.410> with<00:04:45.590> it<00:04:45.680> so<00:04:45.710> like<00:04:46.370> I<00:04:46.460> said<00:04:46.640> just

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:46.670 
play along with it so like I said just

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:48.730 
play along with it so like I said just
learning<00:04:47.120> if<00:04:47.210> anybody<00:04:47.510> has<00:04:47.630> any<00:04:47.780> tips<00:04:48.530> or

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
learning if anybody has any tips or

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.440 
learning if anybody has any tips or
better<00:04:49.400> ways<00:04:49.550> to<00:04:49.610> do<00:04:49.850> anything<00:04:50.030> definitely

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:50.450
