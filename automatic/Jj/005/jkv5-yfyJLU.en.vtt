00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.800
Ah, there's something new!
Path Forward.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:27.740
Happy Birthday!
2 Years Age of Empires

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:40.800
Updates...
Updating Version 3.9 today

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:53.570
Windows XP...
Development Roadmap

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:02.180
Lots of great Stuff planned!!!
That's nice.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:21.880
New Content!
New Expansion!

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.760
What is that?
New Units...

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.560
Ahhh!!!

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.360
So, I see, you'll right now should know. There

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:48.790
is a new Expansion for AoE II HD Edition in
the works. And it will include new Units,

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:56.190
new civilisations, new campangne, new game
modes, new everything! So, this is something,

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:06.040
I am really looking forward to.
We don't have much Information. We just got

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:15.330
this screenshot and the last patchnotes.
Let us see, what we are just looking at.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:22.510
The title of the picture says
"Camel Archer-Preview"

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:30.750
These units you can see the camel archers.
Which is great, 'cause I like camels.

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.700
But these camel archers aren't the only thing,
we can see here.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:44.540
We can also see These cracks on the ground.
This seems to be a dry desert...

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:57.340
We see some trees and also these two birds.
And I assume those birds are storks.

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:10.740
This tells us more, as you might think at the first
sight, because there were more than the 5

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.819
civilisations, I think, they brought us in
Forgotten Empires considered to be included.

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.849
In the beginning they had more in mind.
So, I think those civilisations will be the

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:26.849
civilisations which come with the new expansion.
When you take a look at the storks and the distribution

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:39.720
area, which I got here. They are, of course,
in Europe, Russia and a part of China and

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:45.030
Mongolia.
But those are all civilisations we have already

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:52.870
in the game. We have the Teutons, Goths, Huns,
Slavs, Magyars, Chinese and Mongols.

00:03:53.459 --> 00:04:00.459
So, those Areas are the civilisations, we
have today the Saracens and Persians over

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:04.269
here.
The Mesoamericans are of course not included

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:11.269
here.
But we also got India, which is new in the

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:20.369
last expansion.
But also this strip which could hint the existence

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:26.689
of Khmer or Tibetans civilations, which were
both discussed to be included originally.

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:32.000
And we also got large chunks of Africa.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.689
You can see Ethiopian or Mali kingdom. Ethiopia

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:44.649
was also Christian kingdom back then. When
you take a look at the distribution of storks

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:52.650
in the world, I think those two storks could
be a hint toward, which civilisations we will

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:59.689
see in this expansion.
This is great!

00:05:00.559 --> 00:05:03.969
What do you think about this topic?
Do you agree? Do you disagree?

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:10.969
Do you have other ideas of civilisations they
could include?

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:17.180
This is all still work in progress. While it will come out this year

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.480
It will not come out during the next months or the next patches.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.930
  It will surely take its time.

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:31.930
I think it is even possible that the developers
take some suggestions.

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:39.759
This was basically it for this video!
Thank you very much for watching!

00:05:40.559 --> 00:05:45.270
I am so HYPED for this new Expansion.
See you soon!
