00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.540 
of a 2005 Dodge Grand Caravan I've
already<00:00:06.420> taken<00:00:06.660> off<00:00:07.020> the<00:00:07.740> pieces<00:00:08.010> that<00:00:08.370> go

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
already taken off the pieces that go

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.169 
already taken off the pieces that go
around<00:00:09.000> the<00:00:09.210> molding<00:00:09.660> and<00:00:09.840> the<00:00:09.960> trim<00:00:10.910> it<00:00:11.910> does

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
around the molding and the trim it does

come<00:00:12.420> off<00:00:12.450> if<00:00:12.900> you<00:00:13.049> have<00:00:13.170> to<00:00:13.200> use<00:00:13.380> a<00:00:13.410> lot<00:00:13.620> of

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
come off if you have to use a lot of

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.099 
come off if you have to use a lot of
force<00:00:13.980> so<00:00:14.190> take<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.519> top<00:00:14.730> piece<00:00:14.940> off<00:00:15.179> I<00:00:15.450> had

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
force so take the top piece off I had

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.050 
force so take the top piece off I had
the<00:00:16.230> door<00:00:16.410> open<00:00:16.710> when<00:00:16.770> I<00:00:16.830> did<00:00:17.070> this<00:00:17.279> and<00:00:17.550> you

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
the door open when I did this and you

the door open when I did this and you
just<00:00:18.210> pull<00:00:18.570> this<00:00:18.810> really<00:00:19.470> hard<00:00:19.650> pull<00:00:20.100> it<00:00:20.250> off

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
just pull this really hard pull it off

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.480 
just pull this really hard pull it off
and<00:00:20.699> I<00:00:21.090> took<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.449> whole<00:00:21.480> piece<00:00:21.869> off<00:00:22.340> just<00:00:23.340> for

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
and I took the whole piece off just for

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.179 
and I took the whole piece off just for
ease<00:00:23.730> and<00:00:23.760> then<00:00:24.119> I<00:00:24.180> started<00:00:24.539> on<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:25.410> rear<00:00:26.160> side

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
ease and then I started on the rear side

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.250 
ease and then I started on the rear side

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.560 
of the door with it open and started
pulling<00:00:28.470> on<00:00:28.769> it<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:29.160> got<00:00:29.429> it<00:00:29.460> loosened<00:00:30.090> across

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
pulling on it and got it loosened across

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.810 
pulling on it and got it loosened across
the<00:00:30.810> top<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.289> then<00:00:31.740> took<00:00:31.949> you<00:00:32.550> know<00:00:32.640> make

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
the top and then took you know make

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.970 
the top and then took you know make
pulled<00:00:33.210> it<00:00:33.390> up<00:00:33.540> over<00:00:33.809> that<00:00:34.079> force<00:00:34.380> it<00:00:34.559> over<00:00:34.800> and

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
pulled it up over that force it over and

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.030 
pulled it up over that force it over and
then<00:00:35.130> just<00:00:35.280> reefed<00:00:35.670> on<00:00:35.880> it<00:00:36.059> it<00:00:36.420> is<00:00:37.200> it's<00:00:37.770> pretty

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
then just reefed on it it is it's pretty

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.780 
then just reefed on it it is it's pretty
difficult<00:00:38.570> it<00:00:39.570> takes<00:00:40.100> takes<00:00:41.100> some<00:00:41.340> force<00:00:41.550> so

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
difficult it takes takes some force so

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:42.500 
difficult it takes takes some force so
you<00:00:41.879> might<00:00:42.000> think<00:00:42.149> you're<00:00:42.239> going<00:00:42.360> to<00:00:42.420> be

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
you might think you're going to be

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.790 
you might think you're going to be
breaking<00:00:42.690> it<00:00:42.930> but<00:00:43.079> go<00:00:43.200> ahead<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:43.530> give<00:00:43.649> it<00:00:43.680> a

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
breaking it but go ahead and give it a

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.840 
breaking it but go ahead and give it a
good<00:00:44.040> tug<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.700> it'll<00:00:45.329> pop<00:00:45.480> off<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:46.020> then<00:00:46.850> the

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
good tug and it'll pop off and then the

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.600 
good tug and it'll pop off and then the
rain<00:00:48.030> shield<00:00:48.420> just<00:00:49.320> comes<00:00:49.590> off<00:00:49.770> you'll<00:00:50.430> have

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
rain shield just comes off you'll have

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.130 
rain shield just comes off you'll have
to<00:00:50.730> tear<00:00:50.940> some<00:00:51.149> perforations<00:00:51.570> if<00:00:51.899> you<00:00:51.960> look

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
to tear some perforations if you look

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.000 
to tear some perforations if you look
closely<00:00:52.410> it'll<00:00:53.370> be<00:00:53.460> obvious<00:00:53.670> enough<00:00:54.739> and<00:00:55.739> then

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
closely it'll be obvious enough and then

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.330 
closely it'll be obvious enough and then
I<00:00:56.039> took<00:00:56.160> off<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.969> rod<00:00:57.210> that<00:00:57.750> attaches<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.620> the

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
I took off the rod that attaches to the

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.290 
I took off the rod that attaches to the
mechanism<00:00:59.910> here<00:01:00.800> disconnect<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:02.520> power<00:01:02.820> to

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
mechanism here disconnect the power to

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.560 
mechanism here disconnect the power to
the<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.229> lock<00:01:04.409> actuated<00:01:05.010> unit<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:05.670> then

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
the to the lock actuated unit and then

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.399 
the to the lock actuated unit and then
you<00:01:07.409> have<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.860> get<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.250> a<00:01:08.520> screw<00:01:09.060> that's<00:01:09.750> behind

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
you have to get to a screw that's behind

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.310 
you have to get to a screw that's behind
a<00:01:10.740> sheet<00:01:11.130> of<00:01:11.250> metal<00:01:11.400> so<00:01:11.729> you<00:01:11.760> have<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.240> drill<00:01:12.630> to

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
a sheet of metal so you have to drill to

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.320 
a sheet of metal so you have to drill to
get<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.799> that<00:01:13.920> screw<00:01:14.280> now<00:01:14.790> this<00:01:15.000> is<00:01:15.150> where<00:01:15.299> I

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
get to that screw now this is where I

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.700 
get to that screw now this is where I
could<00:01:15.420> have<00:01:15.659> done<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.840> better<00:01:15.930> job<00:01:16.140> but<00:01:16.530> what<00:01:16.680> I

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
could have done a better job but what I

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.190 
could have done a better job but what I
did<00:01:17.009> is<00:01:17.159> I<00:01:17.280> used<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.670> straw<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.360> it's<00:01:18.900> easy

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
did is I used a straw and it's easy

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.100 
did is I used a straw and it's easy
enough<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.710> look<00:01:19.920> back<00:01:20.189> there<00:01:20.600> from<00:01:21.600> this<00:01:21.810> side

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
enough to look back there from this side

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.200 
enough to look back there from this side
you<00:01:22.380> can<00:01:22.409> look<00:01:22.590> back<00:01:23.100> in<00:01:23.159> here<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:23.759> see<00:01:24.030> where

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
you can look back in here and see where

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.060 
you can look back in here and see where
that<00:01:24.330> screw<00:01:24.780> is<00:01:24.930> that<00:01:25.140> it's<00:01:25.500> lit<00:01:25.770> up<00:01:25.799> now

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
that screw is that it's lit up now

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.530 
that screw is that it's lit up now
nicely<00:01:26.400> because<00:01:26.759> of<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.000> light<00:01:27.150> shining

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
nicely because of the light shining

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.240 
nicely because of the light shining
through<00:01:27.570> but<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:28.470> can<00:01:28.619> see<00:01:28.829> it<00:01:28.950> pretty<00:01:29.159> good

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
through but you can see it pretty good

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.700 
through but you can see it pretty good
you<00:01:30.180> see<00:01:30.360> where<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.570> head<00:01:30.990> of<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.170> screws<00:01:31.500> at

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
you see where the head of the screws at

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.940 
you see where the head of the screws at
take<00:01:32.430> your<00:01:32.729> straw<00:01:33.720> line<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.200> up<00:01:34.290> with<00:01:34.500> it<00:01:34.740> and

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
take your straw line it up with it and

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.249 
take your straw line it up with it and
then<00:01:35.130> get<00:01:35.280> it<00:01:35.400> back<00:01:35.430> so<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:35.939> can<00:01:36.210> check<00:01:36.900> the

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
then get it back so you can check the

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.770 
then get it back so you can check the
depth<00:01:37.560> of<00:01:37.770> that<00:01:37.829> screw<00:01:38.640> where<00:01:39.030> it's<00:01:39.210> at<00:01:39.450> and

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
depth of that screw where it's at and

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.080 
depth of that screw where it's at and
then<00:01:39.990> note<00:01:40.860> where<00:01:41.189> you're<00:01:41.400> where<00:01:41.939> you're

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
then note where you're where you're

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.960 
then note where you're where you're
lining<00:01:42.360> it<00:01:42.600> up<00:01:42.689> from<00:01:42.930> here<00:01:43.200> on<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.619> back

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
lining it up from here on the back

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.190 
lining it up from here on the back
lining<00:01:44.970> up<00:01:45.180> from<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.420> backside<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:45.930> front

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
lining up from the backside to the front

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.780 
lining up from the backside to the front
side<00:01:46.350> then<00:01:46.560> pull<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:46.920> out<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.250> put<00:01:47.579> it<00:01:47.640> in<00:01:47.700> the

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
side then pull it out and put it in the

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.560 
side then pull it out and put it in the
same<00:01:48.030> spot<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.720> then<00:01:49.590> mark<00:01:50.130> you<00:01:50.970> know<00:01:51.090> where

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
same spot and then mark you know where

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.539 
same spot and then mark you know where
where<00:01:51.899> that's<00:01:52.079> at<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.409> then<00:01:52.500> drill<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:53.430> what

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
where that's at and then drill and what

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.149 
where that's at and then drill and what
I<00:01:53.579> did<00:01:53.820> is<00:01:53.939> I<00:01:54.060> drilled<00:01:54.390> using<00:01:54.720> a<00:01:54.860> smaller<00:01:55.860> bit

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
I did is I drilled using a smaller bit

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.429 
I did is I drilled using a smaller bit
and<00:01:56.399> then<00:01:56.790> a<00:01:56.820> little<00:01:56.969> bit<00:01:57.570> larger<00:01:57.990> bit<00:01:58.170> and

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
and then a little bit larger bit and

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.350 
and then a little bit larger bit and
then<00:01:59.130> I<00:01:59.159> used<00:01:59.340> a<00:01:59.430> half<00:01:59.610> inch<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:00.149> half

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
then I used a half inch and that half

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.760 
then I used a half inch and that half
inch<00:02:00.600> actually<00:02:01.170> would<00:02:01.350> have<00:02:01.439> been<00:02:01.590> good

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
inch actually would have been good

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.090 
inch actually would have been good
enough<00:02:01.950> with<00:02:02.159> one<00:02:02.340> hole<00:02:02.549> had<00:02:03.360> I<00:02:03.649> lined<00:02:04.649> it<00:02:04.740> up<00:02:04.860> a

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
enough with one hole had I lined it up a

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.920 
enough with one hole had I lined it up a
little<00:02:05.310> bit<00:02:05.430> better<00:02:05.610> it<00:02:05.909> was<00:02:06.090> just<00:02:06.509> a<00:02:06.689> little

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
little bit better it was just a little

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.669 
little bit better it was just a little
bit<00:02:07.229> off<00:02:08.929> so<00:02:09.929> I<00:02:09.959> didn't<00:02:10.170> want<00:02:10.319> to<00:02:10.349> monkey

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
bit off so I didn't want to monkey

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.530 
bit off so I didn't want to monkey
around<00:02:10.709> getting<00:02:11.459> that<00:02:11.580> screw<00:02:12.030> out<00:02:12.120> and<00:02:12.300> having

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
around getting that screw out and having

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.770 
around getting that screw out and having
it<00:02:12.660> fall<00:02:12.930> so

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
it fall so

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.600 
it fall so
I<00:02:13.810> got<00:02:14.080> a<00:02:14.110> little<00:02:14.350> bit<00:02:14.470> bigger<00:02:14.560> hole<00:02:14.860> no<00:02:15.459> big

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
I got a little bit bigger hole no big

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.670 
I got a little bit bigger hole no big

bar attached and you see it's going to

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.120

hard to see but the screws in there and
it's<00:02:35.890> kind<00:02:35.950> of<00:02:36.190> loose<00:02:36.489> but<00:02:36.819> I'm<00:02:36.940> showing<00:02:37.209> you

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
what I've got set up here as I pushed in

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.510 
what I've got set up here as I pushed in
a<00:02:39.670> piece<00:02:39.910> of<00:02:39.940> cardboard<00:02:41.280> since<00:02:42.280> I<00:02:42.340> have<00:02:42.430> a

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
a piece of cardboard since I have a

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.309 
a piece of cardboard since I have a
little<00:02:42.730> bit<00:02:42.850> bigger<00:02:43.090> hole<00:02:43.420> I<00:02:43.690> can<00:02:43.840> get<00:02:43.989> that<00:02:44.110> in

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
little bit bigger hole I can get that in

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:45.300 
little bit bigger hole I can get that in
there<00:02:44.470> and<00:02:44.650> I<00:02:44.709> don't<00:02:44.770> have<00:02:44.950> to<00:02:45.069> worry<00:02:45.250> about

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
there and I don't have to worry about

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.340 
there and I don't have to worry about
that<00:02:45.580> screw<00:02:45.970> dropping<00:02:46.420> down<00:02:46.630> so<00:02:46.870> if<00:02:46.959> it<00:02:47.080> drops

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
that screw dropping down so if it drops

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:48.660 
that screw dropping down so if it drops
it's<00:02:47.560> going<00:02:47.709> to<00:02:47.769> skip<00:02:47.980> inch<00:02:48.340> into<00:02:48.550> that

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
it's going to skip inch into that

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.170 
it's going to skip inch into that
cardboard<00:02:49.110> so<00:02:50.110> that's<00:02:50.320> a<00:02:50.410> little<00:02:50.560> cheat<00:02:51.180> if

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
cardboard so that's a little cheat if

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.240 
cardboard so that's a little cheat if
you're<00:02:52.300> like<00:02:52.480> me<00:02:52.660> I<00:02:52.690> don't<00:02:52.989> trust<00:02:53.290> the<00:02:54.010> tips

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
you're like me I don't trust the tips

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.860 
you're like me I don't trust the tips
and<00:02:54.489> besides<00:02:54.760> the<00:02:54.940> tip<00:02:55.120> I'm<00:02:55.269> using<00:02:55.450> on<00:02:55.660> this

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
and besides the tip I'm using on this

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.250 
and besides the tip I'm using on this
isn't<00:02:56.320> magnetic<00:02:56.769> and<00:02:57.420> so<00:02:58.420> to<00:02:58.569> get<00:02:58.720> that<00:02:58.930> screw

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
isn't magnetic and so to get that screw

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.110 
isn't magnetic and so to get that screw
in<00:02:59.350> there<00:02:59.470> if<00:02:59.560> you<00:02:59.650> drop<00:02:59.920> it<00:03:00.069> down<00:03:00.250> you're

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
in there if you drop it down you're

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.330 
in there if you drop it down you're
going<00:03:01.239> to<00:03:01.300> be<00:03:01.739> searching<00:03:02.739> for<00:03:02.950> another<00:03:03.190> one

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
going to be searching for another one

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.970 
going to be searching for another one
you'll<00:03:03.700> have<00:03:03.819> a<00:03:03.910> hard<00:03:04.180> time<00:03:04.330> getting<00:03:04.690> it<00:03:04.780> out

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
you'll have a hard time getting it out

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.320 
you'll have a hard time getting it out
you<00:03:05.980> only<00:03:06.100> have<00:03:06.280> access<00:03:06.489> through<00:03:06.940> this<00:03:07.060> hole

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
you only have access through this hole

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.320 
you only have access through this hole
to<00:03:08.319> get<00:03:08.440> down<00:03:08.590> there<00:03:08.800> so<00:03:09.010> try<00:03:10.000> using<00:03:10.180> the

cardboard<00:03:11.310> alright<00:03:12.310> so<00:03:12.610> the<00:03:12.880> screw<00:03:13.510> has<00:03:13.630> been

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
cardboard alright so the screw has been

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.960 
cardboard alright so the screw has been
is<00:03:14.110> in<00:03:14.709> and<00:03:14.890> it's<00:03:15.010> tight<00:03:15.310> you<00:03:15.489> only<00:03:15.610> need<00:03:15.819> that

is in and it's tight you only need that
cardboard<00:03:16.510> piece<00:03:16.690> in<00:03:16.870> there<00:03:17.050> to<00:03:17.260> to<00:03:17.620> get<00:03:17.769> it

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
cardboard piece in there to to get it

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.580 
cardboard piece in there to to get it
started<00:03:18.130> once<00:03:18.459> it's<00:03:18.670> catching<00:03:19.320> pull<00:03:20.320> it<00:03:20.500> out

are tightening it and not loosening it I

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.009 
are tightening it and not loosening it I
was<00:03:30.310> you<00:03:30.820> know<00:03:30.850> years<00:03:31.180> ago<00:03:31.269> when<00:03:31.450> I<00:03:31.630> was<00:03:31.750> a<00:03:31.810> kid

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
was you know years ago when I was a kid

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:33.150 
was you know years ago when I was a kid
you<00:03:32.290> know<00:03:32.350> I<00:03:32.440> always<00:03:32.530> had<00:03:32.709> to<00:03:32.799> think<00:03:32.920> about

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
you know I always had to think about

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.470 
you know I always had to think about
that<00:03:33.340> so<00:03:33.610> if<00:03:33.670> you're<00:03:33.850> one<00:03:34.000> of<00:03:34.090> those<00:03:34.150> meant

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
that so if you're one of those meant

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.630 
that so if you're one of those meant
challenge<00:03:35.140> people<00:03:35.530> you<00:03:36.190> know<00:03:36.310> leave<00:03:36.459> that

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
challenge people you know leave that

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:37.860 
challenge people you know leave that
cardboard<00:03:36.910> in<00:03:37.120> there<00:03:37.150> till<00:03:37.390> you're<00:03:37.510> sure<00:03:37.690> you

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
cardboard in there till you're sure you

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.060 
cardboard in there till you're sure you
are<00:03:38.019> tighten<00:03:38.350> and<00:03:38.410> then<00:03:38.530> just<00:03:38.680> pull<00:03:38.860> it<00:03:38.980> out

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
are tighten and then just pull it out

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:40.949 
are tighten and then just pull it out
and<00:03:39.280> you<00:03:39.340> can<00:03:39.519> get<00:03:39.670> it<00:03:39.790> get<00:03:40.090> tighter<00:03:40.420> tightened

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
and you can get it get tighter tightened

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:43.949 
and you can get it get tighter tightened
up<00:03:41.049> so<00:03:41.230> all<00:03:41.410> of<00:03:41.590> this<00:03:41.680> is<00:03:41.860> in<00:03:42.040> and<00:03:42.280> it<00:03:43.239> works<00:03:43.540> but

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
up so all of this is in and it works but

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.050 
up so all of this is in and it works but
this<00:03:44.170> side<00:03:44.440> is<00:03:44.709> not<00:03:44.890> attached<00:03:45.430> yet<00:03:45.700> so<00:03:45.940> what

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
this side is not attached yet so what

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.720 
this side is not attached yet so what
you<00:03:46.180> need<00:03:46.329> to<00:03:46.450> do<00:03:46.630> is<00:03:47.290> put<00:03:47.650> push<00:03:47.980> this<00:03:48.190> rod<00:03:48.519> into

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
you need to do is put push this rod into

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.670 
you need to do is put push this rod into
the<00:03:48.880> hole<00:03:49.060> and<00:03:49.299> then<00:03:49.540> slide<00:03:49.900> this<00:03:50.170> up<00:03:50.440> and<00:03:50.620> just

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
the hole and then slide this up and just

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.220 
the hole and then slide this up and just
snap<00:03:51.370> it<00:03:51.519> on<00:03:51.670> and<00:03:51.940> that's<00:03:52.600> how<00:03:52.690> you<00:03:52.780> take<00:03:53.019> off

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
snap it on and that's how you take off

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.020 
snap it on and that's how you take off
both<00:03:53.500> sides<00:03:53.829> you<00:03:54.190> know<00:03:54.280> reverse<00:03:54.609> that<00:03:54.820> process

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
both sides you know reverse that process

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.430 
both sides you know reverse that process
so<00:03:55.480> now<00:03:55.660> it's<00:03:55.870> in<00:03:56.170> and<00:03:57.690> it's<00:03:58.690> working<00:03:58.989> where

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
so now it's in and it's working where

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.170 
so now it's in and it's working where
before<00:03:59.590> it<00:03:59.799> wasn't<00:04:00.070> so<00:04:00.400> I'm<00:04:00.910> going<00:04:01.060> to<00:04:01.090> go

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
before it wasn't so I'm going to go

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.120 
before it wasn't so I'm going to go
ahead<00:04:01.450> and<00:04:01.720> I'm<00:04:02.440> going<00:04:02.590> to<00:04:02.650> put<00:04:02.799> a<00:04:02.829> little<00:04:02.980> bit

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
ahead and I'm going to put a little bit

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.060 
ahead and I'm going to put a little bit
of<00:04:03.220> dielectric<00:04:03.850> grease<00:04:03.880> on<00:04:04.420> here<00:04:04.900> which<00:04:05.530> is<00:04:05.560> um

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.070 
of dielectric grease on here which is um

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:10.170 
of dielectric grease on here which is um
is<00:04:07.000> really<00:04:07.750> good<00:04:08.019> to<00:04:08.410> use<00:04:08.560> for<00:04:08.950> any<00:04:09.640> electrical

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
is really good to use for any electrical

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.819 
is really good to use for any electrical
thing<00:04:10.359> just<00:04:10.540> keeps<00:04:10.750> you<00:04:11.019> know<00:04:11.170> corrosion<00:04:11.650> away

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:11.829 
thing just keeps you know corrosion away

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:14.280 
thing just keeps you know corrosion away
and<00:04:11.980> keeps<00:04:12.160> it<00:04:12.310> working<00:04:12.750> so<00:04:13.750> anytime<00:04:13.989> you<00:04:14.260> have

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
and keeps it working so anytime you have

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.349 
and keeps it working so anytime you have
electrical<00:04:14.829> open<00:04:15.220> any<00:04:15.640> of<00:04:15.760> these<00:04:15.850> connections

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
electrical open any of these connections

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:17.460 
electrical open any of these connections
just<00:04:16.419> put<00:04:16.660> a<00:04:16.690> little<00:04:16.900> bit<00:04:16.989> of<00:04:17.049> that<00:04:17.109> on<00:04:17.169> there

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
just put a little bit of that on there

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.979 
just put a little bit of that on there
and<00:04:18.000> snap<00:04:19.000> it<00:04:19.180> in<00:04:19.329> and<00:04:19.510> then<00:04:19.720> it's<00:04:19.840> just

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
and snap it in and then it's just

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.440 
and snap it in and then it's just
putting<00:04:20.650> this<00:04:20.769> all<00:04:21.010> back<00:04:21.250> together<00:04:21.459> one<00:04:22.240> thing

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
putting this all back together one thing

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.300 
putting this all back together one thing
I<00:04:22.570> wish<00:04:22.840> I<00:04:23.169> would<00:04:23.440> have<00:04:23.470> thought<00:04:23.590> about<00:04:24.010> when<00:04:24.280> I

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
I wish I would have thought about when I

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.000 
I wish I would have thought about when I
had<00:04:24.520> this<00:04:24.669> all<00:04:24.849> apart<00:04:25.180> was<00:04:25.479> to<00:04:25.810> get<00:04:26.020> some<00:04:26.710> sound

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
had this all apart was to get some sound

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.220 
had this all apart was to get some sound
deadening

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 
deadening

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.780 
deadening
stop<00:04:29.230> and<00:04:29.500> stick<00:04:29.740> on<00:04:29.890> the<00:04:30.010> door<00:04:30.190> panel<00:04:30.610> to<00:04:30.970> help

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
stop and stick on the door panel to help

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
stop and stick on the door panel to help
you<00:04:33.790> know<00:04:33.880> get<00:04:34.090> rid<00:04:34.180> of<00:04:34.240> some<00:04:34.450> of<00:04:34.480> that<00:04:34.570> road

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
you know get rid of some of that road

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.690 
you know get rid of some of that road
noise<00:04:35.020> if<00:04:35.800> you're<00:04:35.950> driving<00:04:36.190> a<00:04:36.370> Dodge<00:04:36.670> Caravan

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700 
noise if you're driving a Dodge Caravan

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.730 
noise if you're driving a Dodge Caravan
you<00:04:37.270> know<00:04:37.420> a<00:04:37.450> lot<00:04:37.810> is<00:04:38.080> coming<00:04:38.410> from<00:04:38.530> those

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
you know a lot is coming from those

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.860 
you know a lot is coming from those
doors<00:04:39.040> and<00:04:39.340> that's<00:04:40.090> easy<00:04:40.360> enough<00:04:40.600> just<00:04:40.660> to

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
doors and that's easy enough just to

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.800 
doors and that's easy enough just to
apply<00:04:41.700> anyway<00:04:42.700> I<00:04:42.880> didn't<00:04:43.210> do<00:04:43.300> it<00:04:43.420> so<00:04:43.570> I'll<00:04:43.690> be

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
apply anyway I didn't do it so I'll be

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.690 
apply anyway I didn't do it so I'll be
taking<00:04:43.990> off<00:04:44.230> the<00:04:44.380> door<00:04:44.560> panels<00:04:45.010> at<00:04:45.190> some<00:04:45.460> point

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:45.700 
taking off the door panels at some point

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.330 
taking off the door panels at some point
in<00:04:45.820> the<00:04:45.910> future<00:04:45.940> so<00:04:46.480> hopefully<00:04:47.020> you're<00:04:47.860> you

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
in the future so hopefully you're you

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.520 
in the future so hopefully you're you
get<00:04:48.490> your<00:04:48.640> project<00:04:49.060> done<00:04:49.090> and<00:04:49.420> hopefully<00:04:50.380> this

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530
