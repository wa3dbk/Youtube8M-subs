to<00:00:48.329> craft<00:00:48.659> this<00:00:48.870> no<00:00:49.379> I<00:00:49.530> think<00:00:49.829> that<00:00:49.979> just

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:50.159 
to craft this no I think that just

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:51.950 
to craft this no I think that just
spoils<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:50.969> whole<00:00:51.000> point<00:00:51.420> of<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:51.719> being

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
spoils the whole point of it being

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.860 
spoils the whole point of it being
crafted<00:00:52.710> but<00:00:52.979> you<00:00:53.070> know<00:00:53.219> boo<00:00:53.729> max<00:00:53.940> judge<00:00:54.269> but

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
crafted but you know boo max judge but

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.750 
crafted but you know boo max judge but
don't<00:00:55.019> like<00:00:55.440> said<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.739> can<00:00:55.860> craft<00:00:56.100> it<00:00:56.250> pretty

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
don't like said to can craft it pretty

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.910 
don't like said to can craft it pretty
easy<00:00:56.969> all<00:00:57.269> you<00:00:57.299> need<00:00:57.360> is<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.899> dropper<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.500> then

easy all you need is a dropper and then

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.590 
easy all you need is a dropper and then
Goulding<00:00:59.430> it's<00:00:59.610> crap<00:00:59.969> itself<00:01:00.269> the<00:01:00.390> dropper

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
Goulding it's crap itself the dropper

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.279 
Goulding it's crap itself the dropper
just<00:01:01.379> like<00:01:01.589> so<00:01:02.329> yeah<00:01:03.329> sure<00:01:03.809> it's<00:01:04.110> really

00:01:04.279 --> 00:01:04.289
