easy to notice because you can just tell

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.780 
easy to notice because you can just tell
by<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.960> wiring<00:01:13.530> like<00:01:14.220> it's<00:01:14.430> just<00:01:14.580> hanging

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
by the wiring like it's just hanging

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:15.200 
by the wiring like it's just hanging
there

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
there

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.330 
there
it<00:01:16.049> looks<00:01:16.229> like<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.530> clips<00:01:16.860> have<00:01:16.950> been<00:01:17.009> broke

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
it looks like the clips have been broke

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.219 
it looks like the clips have been broke
or<00:01:17.580> something<00:01:17.610> it's<00:01:18.240> most<00:01:18.479> likely<00:01:18.570> that<00:01:19.020> there

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
or something it's most likely that there

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.469 
or something it's most likely that there
has<00:01:19.409> been<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.680> chip<00:01:19.950> in<00:01:20.070> your<00:01:20.100> car<00:01:20.369> or<00:01:20.700> there<00:01:21.360> is
