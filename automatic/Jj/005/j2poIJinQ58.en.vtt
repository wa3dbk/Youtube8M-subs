the<00:01:49.900> volume<00:01:50.290> that<00:01:50.320> you<00:01:50.590> created

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.670 

voila<00:01:55.030> and<00:01:55.560> put<00:01:56.560> it<00:01:56.680> in<00:01:56.830> a<00:01:56.920> ponytail<00:01:58.320> just<00:01:59.320> a

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
voila and put it in a ponytail just a

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:08.040 
voila and put it in a ponytail just a
regular<00:02:01.320> side<00:02:02.320> ponytail<00:02:06.690> and<00:02:07.690> now<00:02:07.810> you<00:02:07.869> look

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
regular side ponytail and now you look

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.500 
regular side ponytail and now you look
like<00:02:08.080> that<00:02:08.520> no<00:02:09.520> makes<00:02:09.729> your<00:02:09.850> schoolgirl<00:02:10.270> ma

like that no makes your schoolgirl ma

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.640 
like that no makes your schoolgirl ma
this<00:02:13.510> is<00:02:13.660> why<00:02:13.810> you<00:02:13.870> start<00:02:14.140> with<00:02:14.290> volume

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
this is why you start with volume

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.080 
this is why you start with volume
because<00:02:14.890> when<00:02:15.040> you<00:02:15.100> put<00:02:15.250> a<00:02:15.280> hair<00:02:15.459> a<00:02:15.670> ponytail

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
because when you put a hair a ponytail

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.850 
because when you put a hair a ponytail
or<00:02:16.300> anything<00:02:16.600> like<00:02:16.810> that<00:02:16.840> in<00:02:17.080> your<00:02:17.230> hair<00:02:17.410> it

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
or anything like that in your hair it

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.380 
or anything like that in your hair it
pulls<00:02:18.280> it<00:02:18.430> down<00:02:18.459> and<00:02:18.760> weighs<00:02:18.850> it<00:02:19.030> down<00:02:19.060> both

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
pulls it down and weighs it down both

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.150 
pulls it down and weighs it down both
sides<00:02:19.600> do<00:02:19.959> so<00:02:20.500> if<00:02:20.560> you<00:02:20.650> start<00:02:20.860> with<00:02:20.950> more

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
sides do so if you start with more

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.310 
sides do so if you start with more
volume<00:02:21.340> then<00:02:22.030> you'll<00:02:22.180> end<00:02:22.360> up<00:02:22.510> with<00:02:22.720> just<00:02:23.170> the

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
volume then you'll end up with just the

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.770 
volume then you'll end up with just the
