where<00:00:01.050> I'm<00:00:01.199> headed<00:00:01.650> with<00:00:01.680> this<00:00:01.979> piece<00:00:02.370> is<00:00:02.730> I'm

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
where I'm headed with this piece is I'm

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.230 
where I'm headed with this piece is I'm
going<00:00:03.870> to<00:00:04.259> with<00:00:04.620> this<00:00:04.740> black<00:00:05.009> background<00:00:05.250> I<00:00:05.850> am

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
going to with this black background I am

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.110 
going to with this black background I am
going<00:00:06.629> to<00:00:06.750> do<00:00:06.870> a<00:00:06.899> spiral<00:00:07.500> on<00:00:07.950> it<00:00:08.189> so<00:00:08.820> that<00:00:09.000> it

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
going to do a spiral on it so that it

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.970 
going to do a spiral on it so that it
looks<00:00:09.330> like<00:00:09.630> a<00:00:09.990> galaxy<00:00:10.889> in<00:00:11.099> space<00:00:12.349> but<00:00:13.349> I<00:00:13.590> want

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
looks like a galaxy in space but I want

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.349 
looks like a galaxy in space but I want
to<00:00:14.519> be<00:00:14.759> careful<00:00:15.089> how<00:00:15.480> I<00:00:15.509> build<00:00:15.900> up<00:00:16.049> my<00:00:16.109> layers

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:17.359 
to be careful how I build up my layers

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:21.439 
to be careful how I build up my layers
so<00:00:18.359> what<00:00:18.810> I'm<00:00:18.960> going<00:00:19.170> to<00:00:19.289> do<00:00:19.529> is<00:00:20.000> now<00:00:21.000> that<00:00:21.029> I've

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
so what I'm going to do is now that I've

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.960 
so what I'm going to do is now that I've
got<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.779> black<00:00:22.160> roughly<00:00:23.160> where<00:00:23.340> I<00:00:23.369> want<00:00:23.670> it

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
got the black roughly where I want it

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.519 
got the black roughly where I want it
I<00:00:24.000> am<00:00:24.900> going<00:00:25.109> to<00:00:25.199> take<00:00:25.410> some<00:00:25.949> medium<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:27.529> do

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
I am going to take some medium and do

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.650 
I am going to take some medium and do
the<00:00:28.680> base<00:00:28.920> layer<00:00:29.340> of<00:00:29.730> what<00:00:30.119> I<00:00:30.150> think<00:00:30.269> will<00:00:30.599> be

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
the base layer of what I think will be

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.150 
the base layer of what I think will be
my<00:00:30.900> spiral<00:00:32.660> then<00:00:33.660> I<00:00:33.899> will<00:00:34.110> fuse<00:00:34.440> that<00:00:34.739> what

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
my spiral then I will fuse that what

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.130 
my spiral then I will fuse that what
that<00:00:35.190> will<00:00:35.489> do<00:00:35.700> is<00:00:35.730> as<00:00:36.030> I<00:00:36.210> build<00:00:36.480> layers<00:00:36.840> on<00:00:37.110> top

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
that will do is as I build layers on top

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.850 
that will do is as I build layers on top
of<00:00:37.469> it<00:00:37.829> infuse<00:00:38.600> it<00:00:39.600> will<00:00:39.809> help<00:00:40.110> protect<00:00:40.350> this

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
of it infuse it will help protect this

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.180 
of it infuse it will help protect this
bottom<00:00:41.399> layer<00:00:41.899> from<00:00:42.899> getting<00:00:43.290> mixed<00:00:43.739> in<00:00:43.980> with

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
bottom layer from getting mixed in with

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.959 
bottom layer from getting mixed in with
all<00:00:44.399> of<00:00:44.579> it<00:00:45.230> so<00:00:46.230> think<00:00:46.739> of<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.129> medium<00:00:47.760> layer

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
all of it so think of the medium layer

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:55.639 
all of it so think of the medium layer
as<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.360> bit<00:00:48.870> of<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:49.020> protective<00:00:49.590> layer<00:00:54.379> so<00:00:55.379> right

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
as a bit of a protective layer so right

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.240 
as a bit of a protective layer so right
now<00:00:55.920> I<00:00:56.190> am<00:00:56.250> just<00:00:57.379> outlining<00:00:58.379> where<00:00:58.770> I<00:00:58.829> think<00:00:59.160> I

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
now I am just outlining where I think I

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:08.240 
now I am just outlining where I think I
want<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.520> go<00:01:05.540> and<00:01:06.590> it's<00:01:07.590> going<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.890> be<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.040> big

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
want to go and it's going to be a big

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:19.929 
want to go and it's going to be a big
spiral<00:01:10.070> and<00:01:11.070> then<00:01:11.400> I'm<00:01:11.549> going<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.729> fill<00:01:12.240> in

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:19.939 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:24.700 

with<00:01:20.600> the<00:01:21.350> medium<00:01:22.390> when<00:01:23.390> it<00:01:23.479> first<00:01:23.719> cools<00:01:24.140> it

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
with the medium when it first cools it

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.569 
with the medium when it first cools it
has<00:01:25.130> kind<00:01:25.549> of<00:01:25.609> a<00:01:25.729> whitish<00:01:27.159> but<00:01:28.159> that's<00:01:28.460> going

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:28.579 
has kind of a whitish but that's going

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:35.260 
has kind of a whitish but that's going
to<00:01:28.640> be<00:01:28.759> covered<00:01:29.179> and<00:01:29.679> as<00:01:30.679> I<00:01:33.729> continue<00:01:34.729> to<00:01:34.759> fuse

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
to be covered and as I continue to fuse

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
to be covered and as I continue to fuse
on<00:01:35.509> top

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.440 

this<00:01:44.860> also<00:01:45.100> as<00:01:45.340> a<00:01:45.370> way<00:01:45.610> of<00:01:45.640> marking<00:01:46.150> out<00:01:46.270> my

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
this also as a way of marking out my

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:52.560 
this also as a way of marking out my
area<00:01:47.700> for<00:01:48.700> future<00:01:48.850> layers<00:01:50.130> and<00:01:51.330> you'll<00:01:52.330> see

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
area for future layers and you'll see

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.930 
area for future layers and you'll see
that<00:01:52.690> I'm<00:01:52.840> I'm<00:01:53.140> dropping<00:01:54.720> little<00:01:55.720> bits<00:01:56.140> of<00:01:56.940> hot

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
that I'm I'm dropping little bits of hot

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.460 
that I'm I'm dropping little bits of hot
wax<00:01:58.180> everywhere<00:01:58.930> I<00:02:00.450> get<00:02:01.450> so<00:02:01.660> intent<00:02:02.080> on<00:02:02.260> what

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
wax everywhere I get so intent on what

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.490 
wax everywhere I get so intent on what
I'm<00:02:02.620> doing<00:02:03.010> is<00:02:03.280> just<00:02:06.270> happens

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
I'm doing is just happens

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.960 
I'm doing is just happens
it<00:02:08.500> can<00:02:08.649> also<00:02:08.830> be<00:02:08.979> you'll<00:02:09.399> notice<00:02:09.670> I'm<00:02:09.820> wearing

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
it can also be you'll notice I'm wearing

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.250 
it can also be you'll notice I'm wearing
long<00:02:10.330> sleeves<00:02:10.690> it<00:02:10.869> can<00:02:10.990> also<00:02:11.110> be<00:02:11.350> a<00:02:11.380> good<00:02:11.590> idea

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
long sleeves it can also be a good idea

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.190 
long sleeves it can also be a good idea
to<00:02:14.260> wear<00:02:14.470> long<00:02:14.800> sleeves<00:02:15.840> because<00:02:16.840> you're

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
to wear long sleeves because you're

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.960 
to wear long sleeves because you're
working<00:02:17.560> with<00:02:17.740> so<00:02:18.190> many<00:02:18.220> different<00:02:18.400> hot

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
working with so many different hot

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.210 
working with so many different hot
things<00:02:20.520> you<00:02:21.520> can<00:02:21.670> burn<00:02:21.880> yourself<00:02:22.030> easily<00:02:23.220> so

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
things you can burn yourself easily so

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:30.930 
things you can burn yourself easily so
do<00:02:24.459> keep<00:02:24.640> that<00:02:24.700> in<00:02:24.910> mind<00:02:29.280> and<00:02:30.280> when<00:02:30.580> it<00:02:30.700> comes

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
do keep that in mind and when it comes

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.940 
do keep that in mind and when it comes
to<00:02:31.180> fusing<00:02:31.660> this<00:02:31.840> I'm<00:02:32.020> going<00:02:32.170> to<00:02:32.260> fuse<00:02:32.530> very

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
to fusing this I'm going to fuse very

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.890 
to fusing this I'm going to fuse very
carefully<00:02:36.090> when<00:02:37.090> you<00:02:37.180> read<00:02:37.360> about<00:02:37.480> it<00:02:37.750> you'll

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
carefully when you read about it you'll

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:46.199 
carefully when you read about it you'll
say<00:02:38.200> fuse<00:02:38.620> gently<00:02:39.220> I<00:02:44.730> was<00:02:45.730> saying<00:02:45.970> earlier

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
say fuse gently I was saying earlier

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.160 
say fuse gently I was saying earlier
that<00:02:46.450> you<00:02:46.840> can<00:02:47.140> I<00:02:47.380> have<00:02:47.890> some<00:02:48.130> medium<00:02:48.459> on<00:02:48.580> this

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
that you can I have some medium on this

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.870 
that you can I have some medium on this
palette<00:02:50.170> so<00:02:50.680> I'm<00:02:50.830> just<00:02:51.010> picking<00:02:51.220> up<00:02:51.400> the<00:02:51.550> extra

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
palette so I'm just picking up the extra

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.770 
palette so I'm just picking up the extra
drop<00:02:52.120> just<00:02:52.780> right<00:02:52.930> there<00:02:53.200> I<00:02:54.540> was<00:02:55.540> saying

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
drop just right there I was saying

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:02.940 
drop just right there I was saying
earlier<00:02:56.170> that<00:02:56.260> you<00:02:56.650> can<00:02:57.959> fuse<00:02:59.670> using<00:03:00.670> heat<00:03:01.950> you

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
earlier that you can fuse using heat you

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.800 
earlier that you can fuse using heat you
can<00:03:03.100> also<00:03:03.250> fuse<00:03:03.700> just<00:03:04.030> setting<00:03:04.330> it<00:03:04.450> out<00:03:04.570> in<00:03:04.690> the

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
can also fuse just setting it out in the

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.590 
can also fuse just setting it out in the
Sun<00:03:05.110> in<00:03:05.350> a<00:03:05.410> hot<00:03:05.590> Sun<00:03:06.000> you'd<00:03:07.000> be<00:03:07.090> surprised<00:03:07.480> how

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
Sun in a hot Sun you'd be surprised how

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.699 
Sun in a hot Sun you'd be surprised how
effective<00:03:08.170> that<00:03:08.200> can<00:03:08.350> be

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
effective that can be

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.220 
effective that can be
or<00:03:08.950> even<00:03:09.790> putting<00:03:10.000> it<00:03:10.209> under<00:03:10.450> some<00:03:10.630> hot<00:03:10.780> bulbs

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
or even putting it under some hot bulbs

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:17.940 
or even putting it under some hot bulbs
it<00:03:11.440> takes<00:03:11.680> longer<00:03:12.750> but<00:03:13.750> it<00:03:13.930> works

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.800 

and<00:03:18.400> I<00:03:19.060> am<00:03:19.720> I<00:03:20.200> had<00:03:20.680> it<00:03:20.770> on<00:03:20.890> a<00:03:20.920> lower<00:03:21.190> speed<00:03:21.640> I<00:03:21.940> am

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
and I am I had it on a lower speed I am

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.130 
and I am I had it on a lower speed I am
just<00:03:23.650> heating<00:03:24.610> enough<00:03:25.060> till<00:03:25.510> I<00:03:25.630> see<00:03:26.110> it

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
just heating enough till I see it

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:34.030 
just heating enough till I see it
looking<00:03:26.650> wet

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.819 

and<00:03:34.610> I<00:03:34.879> have<00:03:35.090> to<00:03:35.239> keep<00:03:35.390> it<00:03:35.569> moving<00:03:38.739> if<00:03:39.739> you

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:39.829 
and I have to keep it moving if you

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:41.229 
and I have to keep it moving if you
don't<00:03:40.040> keep<00:03:40.189> it<00:03:40.370> moving<00:03:40.640> you<00:03:40.730> can<00:03:40.879> actually

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
don't keep it moving you can actually

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:46.330 
don't keep it moving you can actually
kind<00:03:41.420> of<00:03:41.569> burn<00:03:41.810> your<00:03:42.019> board<00:03:45.069> not<00:03:46.069> that<00:03:46.250> you

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
kind of burn your board not that you

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:47.949 
kind of burn your board not that you
can't<00:03:46.549> recover<00:03:46.849> from<00:03:47.000> that<00:03:47.360> but<00:03:47.689> it<00:03:47.810> just

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
can't recover from that but it just

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:54.399 
can't recover from that but it just
takes<00:03:48.230> longer<00:03:48.650> than<00:03:52.780> which<00:03:53.780> means<00:03:54.019> I've<00:03:54.230> done

00:03:54.399 --> 00:03:54.409 
takes longer than which means I've done

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:59.339 
takes longer than which means I've done
it<00:03:54.500> before<00:03:54.620> so<00:03:55.190> when<00:03:55.940> I<00:03:55.970> beginner<00:03:56.299> things

00:03:59.339 --> 00:03:59.349 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:04.869 

hmm<00:04:00.519> okay<00:04:01.519> looks<00:04:01.730> like<00:04:02.079> Milky<00:04:03.079> Way<00:04:03.200> there<00:04:03.879> okay

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:04.879 
hmm okay looks like Milky Way there okay

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:10.420 
hmm okay looks like Milky Way there okay
I'm<00:04:05.060> gonna<00:04:05.239> let<00:04:05.510> that<00:04:07.510> cool<00:04:08.510> and<00:04:09.159> then<00:04:10.159> I'll

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
I'm gonna let that cool and then I'll

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.569 
I'm gonna let that cool and then I'll
start<00:04:10.700> my<00:04:10.819> next<00:04:10.879> layer<00:04:11.150> color
