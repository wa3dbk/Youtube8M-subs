00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:15.030
 hello, I'm jose emiliano rodríguez álvarez 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.269
 and we are in this video project 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.550
 brief where we talk about matters that 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:23.110
 may be of your interest, especially to you 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.780
 that as a teenager 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:27.460
 the last video we talked about this 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:30.130
 equation of human freedom and 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.710
 we said that if we are free beings but 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:35.560
 in a limited way because that's our way 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.540
 limited nature fine today I want 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.880
 briefly cover this other 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:43.000
 faculty called will the 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:45.370
 will is this faculty that we 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.440
 we have where the question of 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.980
 the elections and also the 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.190
 intentions the will is oriented 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.690
 as well as freedom towards good 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.060
 he also said in the last video that 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.710
 further on I will explain in what sense I am 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.989
 raising the good thing then the 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.449
 will always choose a good for you 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:08.080
 if everything that represents a good for 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:10.840
 You will be chosen by the will of 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:14.369
 there from this perspective there is no 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.180
 no human being in his faculties 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.090
 full in the use of their faculties 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:22.690
 full that you choose a bad for yourself from 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:24.720
 consciously if we always choose to 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.180
 through our will and we choose 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.810
 always good for us 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:34.410
 there is not this situation that a being 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.630
 human choose consciously wrong 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.240
 for him I put it clear for example 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.120
 because if we know that the cigar is us 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.460
 provoke 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:46.940
 affect on our health because it 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.440
 choose then choose because the will to 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.330
 through intelligence the 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.430
 intelligence is what presents you the 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.230
 will the cigar as a good and 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.050
 then the will what it does is 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.940
 choose that good that is presented by 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:02.150
 the intelligence from there that those who smoke 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:04.300
 and they smoke because for them the cigar 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:07.190
 represents a good though 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.080
 consciously we know that we are going to 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.480
 cause a problem in the long run 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.870
 severe health such as having cancer 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.580
 in the lung there is no smoker 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.680
 ask him to smoke a cigar 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.660
 thinking I'm going to throw my cigarette 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.530
 because I want to have a pulmonary emphysema 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:27.140
 they do not usually tell you it's too cold 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:29.960
 cement a cigarette and in that way they 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:33.740
 posing the cigar as a good for 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:36.650
 That's why they choose but the cigar 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.390
 he causes us to smoke what causes us 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.910
 it causes us a great 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.560
 then more or less like that the 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.500
 will of hope and this can serve you 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.480
 to get to know how we function as 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.290
 people see you in the next video 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.290
 short until later
