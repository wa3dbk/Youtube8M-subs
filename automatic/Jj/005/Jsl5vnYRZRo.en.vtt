00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.320
 in relation to the changes 

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.320
 technology has evolved quite a bit. 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.320
 is one of those most commented evolutions of the 5th 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.270
 standards by creating five locks in the norms than the other five in procon or 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.060
 Victor 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.150
 some businessmen already in question 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.150
 the sector is already trying to increase the 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.710
 produce it has already marketed some buses in these standards 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:31.519
 jacques using java and brew dog 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.060
 still this year 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.060
 the raise 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.070
 and others for refusing to deliver 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.820
 the game key 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:51.970
 joel houston 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.970
 and they will always 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.970
 I'm bet next 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.000
 right 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.119
 the shrimp lobster 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:08.789
 long experience in relation to the singer transport where they were looking for 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.550
 that I had been hospitalized with the market 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.420
 and we prearranged assault on the training so much 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.180
 which drivers like bida from the mechanics area stop the bus 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.100
 refused to talk yes to this recording with us about it 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:27.290
 yesterday 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.590
 how to know that what I think I think every situation 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:31.810
 however studies 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.840
 it was something that the last tubik 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.910
 curious as you get questions 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.620
 I do not think there's 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.620
 professional press courses 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.550
 is an invalid cross course 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.130
 the eca-usp gates 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.130
 The letters 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.420
 the courses in the building because being a tourist is much more 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.240
 I've done everything that's great. 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.240
 it's much more of the conflict 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.479
 was the first crime 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.929
 my husband together and mixed end minute 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.649
 variable examples 

00:02:11.649 --> 00:02:14.689
 I'll take advantage of the sinop area 

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:17.809
 the capabilities 

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:20.139
 the new technicians phil davis 

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:23.139
 yesterday's trucks 

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:26.889
 so do whatever she does left 

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:29.429
 the public 

00:02:29.429 --> 00:02:32.429
 free many have already spent so many resources 

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:35.389
 we will give too much 

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:38.079
 the service 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:40.299
 It's harder 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:42.929
 the bus coach 

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:44.679
 it's a choice 

00:02:44.679 --> 00:02:48.159
 and at the moment the lambs angical fuel 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:49.839
 legal employees 

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:51.129
 the technicians 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:52.929
 The weather is mild 

00:02:52.929 --> 00:02:55.929
 of the politician is millions 

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:01.109
 It's harder 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:04.489
 it's a job 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:06.869
 many times the brusque announced 

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:08.439
 under 

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:11.439
 politicians before the few men 

00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:15.319
 this is not attractive 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:17.139
 and is not attractive 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:20.249
 the only attempt turned out to be very difficult 

00:03:20.249 --> 00:03:22.289
 and the good technicians 

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:24.329
 I got a vacancy 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:27.429
 echoes that I wrote a first step 

00:03:27.429 --> 00:03:29.279
 that increasingly difficult 

00:03:29.279 --> 00:03:30.859
 increasingly technical 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:32.379
 and every time 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:35.379
 it is more difficult to have skills 

00:03:36.179 --> 00:03:38.929
 Why change a little bit? 

00:03:38.929 --> 00:03:41.149
 the focus even more so 

00:03:41.149 --> 00:03:44.359
 working on the issue of transport and the issue of 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:46.569
 relationship 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:49.689
 is we realize is the banalization that the Swedish auto group 

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:53.049
 in relation to the 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:56.049
 yes, swedish auto group and 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:00.299
 not having reported year 

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:02.819
 let's say 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:05.889
 It is obvious that we of German 

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:08.889
 this is capable 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:13.099
 we have and this is good 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:15.099
 I could not continue 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:18.459
 and this month will be in our dna 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.459
 is that it makes us here 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:23.849
 no dops 3 to 1 

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:25.710
 any one service 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.710
 with that money with it 

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:35.210
 as usual 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.210
 check out qatar here 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.529
 and oswaldo 

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:42.229
 the new rabbit steps 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:44.249
 when the machines 

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:45.550
 in the pension fund 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.759
 when the four detainees 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:50.210
 of risks 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.419
 It's true that the guest is from CuiabÃ¡. 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:57.490
 about this but we talked and to the planet of the mind I'm going to ask 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.990
 Mr 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.969

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:09.689
 we lost time was a fan 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:13.729

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.270
 we want to win the environment 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.569
 because summer 

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:41.219

 bus stop 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:08.710
 the industry having been detained 

00:06:13.069 --> 00:06:16.069
 he said cutting will cost 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:21.460
 for workers 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:22.809
