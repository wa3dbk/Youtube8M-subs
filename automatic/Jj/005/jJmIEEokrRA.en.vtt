I'll build the bike we have a bar tool

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.439 
I'll build the bike we have a bar tool
that<00:03:42.190> measures<00:03:42.400> so<00:03:42.699> the<00:03:42.790> bars<00:03:42.970> are<00:03:43.150> always<00:03:43.299> in

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:43.449 
that measures so the bars are always in

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:46.920 
that measures so the bars are always in
the<00:03:43.540> same<00:03:43.690> spot<00:03:43.750> and<00:03:45.209> he'll<00:03:46.209> get<00:03:46.599> on<00:03:46.660> it

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
the same spot and he'll get on it

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.720 
the same spot and he'll get on it
sometimes<00:03:47.530> he'll<00:03:47.889> move<00:03:47.980> the<00:03:48.099> bars<00:03:48.280> and<00:03:48.549> move

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
sometimes he'll move the bars and move

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.699 
sometimes he'll move the bars and move
them<00:03:48.879> right<00:03:48.910> back<00:03:49.180> to<00:03:49.299> where<00:03:49.419> they<00:03:49.480> were<00:03:49.709> with

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
them right back to where they were with

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.890

that's<00:04:56.460> beneficial<00:04:56.820> damn<00:04:57.090> I<00:04:57.330> don't<00:04:57.510> know<00:04:57.690> if

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
that's beneficial damn I don't know if

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.980 
that's beneficial damn I don't know if
it<00:04:57.840> is<00:04:57.930> or<00:04:58.050> not<00:04:58.080> but<00:04:58.410> I<00:04:59.630> like<00:05:00.630> to<00:05:00.720> think<00:05:00.930> of<00:05:00.990> this

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
it is or not but I like to think of this

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:03.930 
it is or not but I like to think of this
so<00:05:02.560> that's<00:05:02.740> it<00:05:03.009> that's<00:05:03.160> the<00:05:03.280> ins<00:05:03.460> and<00:05:03.639> outs<00:05:03.759> of

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
so that's it that's the ins and outs of

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.580 
so that's it that's the ins and outs of
the<00:05:04.030> number<00:05:04.240> 41<00:05:04.630> machine<00:05:04.960> you're<00:05:05.380> not<00:05:05.470> going

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
the number 41 machine you're not going

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:06.840 
the number 41 machine you're not going
to<00:05:05.650> see<00:05:05.800> him<00:05:05.860> for<00:05:06.009> a<00:05:06.069> little<00:05:06.160> while<00:05:06.400> but<00:05:06.639> keep

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:06.850 
to see him for a little while but keep

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:08.430 
to see him for a little while but keep
your<00:05:06.940> eye<00:05:07.000> up<00:05:07.270> because<00:05:07.509> when<00:05:08.139> he<00:05:08.199> makes<00:05:08.350> his

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
your eye up because when he makes his

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:17.839 
your eye up because when he makes his
return<00:05:08.830> it's<00:05:09.039> going<00:05:09.160> to<00:05:09.220> be<00:05:09.280> good

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:17.849 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:19.909
