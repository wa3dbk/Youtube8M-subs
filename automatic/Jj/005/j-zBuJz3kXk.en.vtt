00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.230
 let's see the next one and we look forward to 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.950
 that is installed good wonder about 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:10.080
 what weighs more than 300 megabytes is because 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.510
 all internal programs come only 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.250
 all portable programs 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.200
 internally remember that most 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.270
 programs that through this 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.550
 application this tool are 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.130
 free and some come in their 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.259
 good demo versions do not wait for it to 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.570
 install and have already returned once the 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.420
 installation let's remove this option and 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.160
 let's give it a finish and once 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.080
 we have installed a folder 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.470
 same name of the installer simply 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.180
 we can delete the installer that does not 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.979
 we will need more and we open the folder 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.990
 once we open the folder we are going to 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.030
 run this file as administrator 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.070
 let's see if they will come out 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.110
 those options we are going to give you in start and 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.369
 we wait for the application to open 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.590
 once the application opens we 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.820
 this will be simply and we will leave 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.380
 the different categories of 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.180
 different applications implementation 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.940
 we are going to intern, all the 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.550
 applications will come to us in folders in 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.380
 this case if we do not go to web browser we 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.350
 will come out the two portal browsers in 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:11.530
 this case operates and mozilla firefox if we 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:15.130
 we go to farts pe clients we will leave the 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:17.770
 torrent and the emule that are managers of 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.830
 downloads if we go to multimedia 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:23.290
 let's find the different 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:27.520
 audio video players among others 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:30.580
 in the section of low index extras there is 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.320
 other tools does not show them all 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:36.040
 the tools because it would take a lot 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:39.520
 the video but most tools 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.200
 they are very good that's all friends in 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.420
