00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:36.190

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.590
 awesome game values christian 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.600
 for example, I have 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.090
 during the press conference of nintendo 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:49.930
 I ran the lower one 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:52.000
 Touchscreen extreme looked at and that 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.280
 was christian seega gone draufhat 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.830
 and I succeed for him 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.410
 in that sense and I can imagine 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:02.140
 that was funny as I had 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.360
 I'm just a bit trashy 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.070
 tennis player he knows since the super 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.550
 mario who knows what you all for one 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:12.040
 shit can build on it how do you stand 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.840
 play so you know once I'm doing 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.130
 which , for example, will happen too 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.020
 I think earlier I have an explanation 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.240
 bit gambled 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.619
 yes say as much as always cool me 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.840
 I've always had yahoo sports 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:25.450
 had at home or at that time very nice 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.430
 even with patrick and feather and have 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.750
 then the wii sports and wii tennis 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.580
 played that was not always mega fat 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.899
 So you see cool thing and I am 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.979
 glad that you can do it now with the pro 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:34.660
 controller can play 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:36.550
 Generally I had the tennis games 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.990
 very funny thing because such a game 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.240
 It has been there for a long time, so to speak 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.619
 it's just short trifle again 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.649
 We both do not want there 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:46.660
 first time tribal opponents together 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:48.819
 showed that was just mega funny and me 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:52.830
 I think so we never have to 

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:55.300
 channel shown or even before our time 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:58.929
 yes I can imagine that that 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:01.660
 just play in the double-ever 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:03.880
 yes you can 42 went two play and 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.170
 I'm glad they burn I've got eyes 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.580
 exactly as I know she gives 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.319
 just went through the camera 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.160
 Apart from where the eyes wandered in 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.920
 Brand shame on you 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:15.319
 Ten to 15 years, three of them all right 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.120
 yes i am looking forward to any event 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.700
 this game I think will be there already 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.989
 look into 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.849
 I hope as I said that it will be double 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.410
 is so that you can then four 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:27.440
 also very well imagine movies that it 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.870
 for example 55 pm with speak 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.620
 So it can be a couple, so why 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.790
 I imagined myself very horny and 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:38.190
 I'm looking forward to it in any case 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:43.940
 Game, set and match 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.940
