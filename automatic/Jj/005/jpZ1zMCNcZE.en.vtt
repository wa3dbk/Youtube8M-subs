00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
the whole sandwich yep so all right I'm

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:03.830 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:09.530 

and<00:01:04.830> so<00:01:05.670> it's<00:01:05.790> not<00:01:05.880> quite<00:01:06.060> lined<00:01:06.420> up<00:01:07.640> and<00:01:08.640> then

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
and so it's not quite lined up and then

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.000 
and so it's not quite lined up and then
I'm<00:01:09.659> going<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.869> just<00:01:10.049> put<00:01:10.290> it<00:01:10.380> from<00:01:10.590> corner<00:01:10.979> to

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
I'm going to just put it from corner to

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.910 
I'm going to just put it from corner to
corner<00:01:13.430> and<00:01:14.430> cut<00:01:15.060> these<00:01:15.210> in<00:01:15.540> half<00:01:15.619> the<00:01:16.619> reason

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
corner and cut these in half the reason

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.440 
corner and cut these in half the reason
why<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.100> wouldn't<00:01:17.369> want<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.640> make<00:01:17.790> too<00:01:18.119> thick

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
why you wouldn't want to make too thick

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.270 
why you wouldn't want to make too thick
of<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.630> stack<00:01:18.930> is<00:01:19.140> that<00:01:19.290> you'll<00:01:19.409> get<00:01:19.650> a<00:01:19.710> shift<00:01:20.040> in

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
of a stack is that you'll get a shift in

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.190 
of a stack is that you'll get a shift in
the<00:01:20.369> stack<00:01:20.610> of<00:01:20.880> fabrics<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.479> you<00:01:21.869> want<00:01:22.049> them

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
the stack of fabrics and you want them

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.800 
the stack of fabrics and you want them
to<00:01:22.320> be<00:01:22.439> fairly<00:01:22.650> precise<00:01:23.189> corner<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.700> corner<00:01:23.850> so

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
to be fairly precise corner to corner so

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.170 
to be fairly precise corner to corner so
what<00:01:25.320> we're<00:01:25.500> going<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.830> do<00:01:26.040> now<00:01:26.250> is<00:01:26.670> make<00:01:26.939> this

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
what we're going to do now is make this

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.499 
what we're going to do now is make this
block<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:28.310> you'll<00:01:29.310> notice<00:01:29.579> that<00:01:29.759> when<00:01:30.090> we<00:01:30.150> go

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
block and you'll notice that when we go

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:39.260 
block and you'll notice that when we go
to<00:01:31.049> put<00:01:31.560> this<00:01:32.119> triangle<00:01:33.119> on<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:34.549> side<00:01:37.159> of<00:01:38.270> the

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
to put this triangle on the side of the

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.530 
to put this triangle on the side of the
square<00:01:40.220> the<00:01:41.220> points<00:01:41.579> stick<00:01:41.880> out<00:01:42.060> you<00:01:42.299> can't

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
square the points stick out you can't

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.130 
square the points stick out you can't
really<00:01:42.630> tell<00:01:43.110> how<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.409> line<00:01:43.710> it<00:01:43.740> up<00:01:43.950> so<00:01:44.960> we<00:01:45.960> have

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
really tell how to line it up so we have

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.469 
really tell how to line it up so we have
a<00:01:46.170> nifty<00:01:46.500> little<00:01:46.710> tool<00:01:47.369> called<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:48.119> triangle

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
a nifty little tool called a triangle

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.870 
a nifty little tool called a triangle
trimmer<00:01:48.960> which<00:01:49.829> we'll<00:01:50.040> use<00:01:50.070> in<00:01:50.280> this<00:01:50.610> case

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
trimmer which we'll use in this case

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.050 
trimmer which we'll use in this case
there<00:01:51.350> it's<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.530> blue<00:01:52.740> one<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:53.460> comes<00:01:53.790> in<00:01:53.970> a

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
there it's the blue one it comes in a

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.020 
there it's the blue one it comes in a
set<00:01:54.210> of<00:01:54.360> two<00:01:54.570> blue<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.020> pink<00:01:55.850> so<00:01:56.850> we're<00:01:57.000> just

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
set of two blue and pink so we're just

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.660 
set of two blue and pink so we're just
going<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.420> line<00:01:57.659> this<00:01:57.869> up<00:01:57.930> with<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.619> edge<00:01:58.770> so

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
going to line this up with the edge so

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.510 
going to line this up with the edge so
both<00:01:59.909> edges<00:02:00.360> of<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:01.200> trimmer<00:02:01.469> are<00:02:01.799> along<00:02:02.340> the

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
both edges of the trimmer are along the

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.300 
both edges of the trimmer are along the
edges<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.030> just<00:02:03.090> cut<00:02:03.630> off<00:02:03.979> that<00:02:04.979> little<00:02:05.040> bit

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
edges and just cut off that little bit

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.789 
edges and just cut off that little bit
there<00:02:05.630> the<00:02:06.630> nice<00:02:06.810> part<00:02:07.079> about<00:02:07.110> these<00:02:07.380> tools<00:02:07.590> is

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
there the nice part about these tools is

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.410 
there the nice part about these tools is
they<00:02:07.979> have<00:02:08.129> little<00:02:08.340> picture<00:02:08.580> diagrams<00:02:09.119> on

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
they have little picture diagrams on

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.999 
they have little picture diagrams on
them<00:02:09.599> so<00:02:09.780> you'll<00:02:09.899> know<00:02:10.020> exactly<00:02:10.050> which<00:02:10.739> one

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
them so you'll know exactly which one

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.700 
them so you'll know exactly which one
you're<00:02:11.250> going<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.459> be

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
you're going to be

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.320 
you're going to be
using<00:02:11.890> because<00:02:12.490> the<00:02:12.610> technique<00:02:13.000> is<00:02:13.180> the<00:02:13.210> same

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
using because the technique is the same

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.200 
using because the technique is the same
as<00:02:13.810> the<00:02:13.930> little<00:02:14.140> diagram<00:02:14.290> on<00:02:14.650> okay<00:02:14.970> so<00:02:15.970> now

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
as the little diagram on okay so now

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.370 
as the little diagram on okay so now
you'll<00:02:16.990> see<00:02:17.320> that<00:02:17.710> those<00:02:17.920> ends<00:02:18.850> are<00:02:19.380> squared

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
you'll see that those ends are squared

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.810 
you'll see that those ends are squared
off<00:02:20.560> and<00:02:20.860> when<00:02:21.190> I<00:02:21.220> put<00:02:21.640> it<00:02:21.820> on<00:02:21.960> this<00:02:22.960> square<00:02:23.820> it

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
off and when I put it on this square it

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.260 
off and when I put it on this square it
lines<00:02:25.360> up<00:02:25.690> perfectly<00:02:26.110> so<00:02:27.010> now<00:02:27.940> we're<00:02:28.120> going<00:02:28.210> to

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
lines up perfectly so now we're going to

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.150 
lines up perfectly so now we're going to
sew<00:02:28.600> that<00:02:28.840> and<00:02:29.080> while<00:02:29.200> you<00:02:29.320> sew<00:02:29.530> that<00:02:29.710> I'll<00:02:29.890> cut

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
sew that and while you sew that I'll cut

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.960 
sew that and while you sew that I'll cut
the<00:02:30.690> points<00:02:31.690> off<00:02:31.870> of<00:02:31.900> a<00:02:32.140> couple<00:02:32.470> more

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
the points off of a couple more

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
the points off of a couple more
sometimes<00:02:33.970> they<00:02:34.090> call<00:02:34.210> these<00:02:34.390> engineered

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
sometimes they call these engineered

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.740 
sometimes they call these engineered
corners<00:02:35.470> and<00:02:35.710> it's<00:02:36.280> a<00:02:36.610> great<00:02:37.030> thing<00:02:37.360> to<00:02:37.600> help

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
corners and it's a great thing to help

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.370 
corners and it's a great thing to help
us<00:02:37.960> keep<00:02:38.620> accuracy<00:02:39.280> in<00:02:39.340> our<00:02:39.490> patchwork

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
us keep accuracy in our patchwork

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.840 
us keep accuracy in our patchwork
usually<00:02:41.380> that's<00:02:41.530> if<00:02:41.860> we<00:02:42.040> have<00:02:42.160> error<00:02:42.400> a<00:02:42.520> lot<00:02:42.730> of

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
usually that's if we have error a lot of

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.930 
usually that's if we have error a lot of
times<00:02:43.060> it<00:02:43.270> happens<00:02:43.570> to<00:02:44.140> come<00:02:44.320> in<00:02:44.620> our<00:02:45.040> are

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
times it happens to come in our are

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.400 
times it happens to come in our are
piecing<00:02:46.450> so<00:02:47.320> this<00:02:48.190> keeps<00:02:48.640> the<00:02:49.410> intersection

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
piecing so this keeps the intersection

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.780 
piecing so this keeps the intersection
is<00:02:50.500> just<00:02:50.850> alright<00:02:51.850> okay<00:02:52.750> thread<00:02:53.410> and<00:02:53.950> here's

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
is just alright okay thread and here's

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.480 
is just alright okay thread and here's
one<00:02:55.000> for<00:02:55.210> the<00:02:55.270> other<00:02:55.450> side<00:02:55.810> so<00:02:56.620> you're<00:02:57.370> going

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.490 
one for the other side so you're going

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.310 
one for the other side so you're going
to<00:02:57.520> want<00:02:57.700> to<00:02:57.730> put<00:02:57.910> those<00:02:58.000> on<00:02:58.210> opposite<00:02:58.960> sides

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
to want to put those on opposite sides

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:04.290 
to want to put those on opposite sides
correct<00:03:00.220> the<00:03:00.700> first<00:03:01.030> time<00:03:01.360> the<00:03:01.840> first<00:03:02.080> two<00:03:03.300> and

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
correct the first time the first two and

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.240 
correct the first time the first two and
there's<00:03:04.660> usually<00:03:04.900> one<00:03:05.380> thing<00:03:05.710> that<00:03:05.890> everybody

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
there's usually one thing that everybody

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.110 
there's usually one thing that everybody
does<00:03:06.820> when<00:03:07.630> they're<00:03:07.810> making<00:03:07.960> this<00:03:08.260> block

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
does when they're making this block

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.430 
does when they're making this block
inevitably<00:03:10.120> even<00:03:10.690> if<00:03:10.810> you're<00:03:10.930> a<00:03:10.960> seasoned

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
inevitably even if you're a seasoned

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.960 
inevitably even if you're a seasoned
seasoned<00:03:11.950> quilter<00:03:12.670> as<00:03:12.850> you<00:03:13.360> put<00:03:13.600> on<00:03:13.780> two<00:03:14.650> sides

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
seasoned quilter as you put on two sides

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.470 
seasoned quilter as you put on two sides
and<00:03:16.530> thinking<00:03:17.530> I<00:03:17.770> can<00:03:18.280> speed<00:03:18.670> along<00:03:18.970> and<00:03:19.330> do

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
and thinking I can speed along and do

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.870 
and thinking I can speed along and do
the<00:03:19.630> next<00:03:19.840> step<00:03:19.990> without<00:03:20.680> pressing<00:03:21.310> well

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
the next step without pressing well

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.970 
the next step without pressing well
doesn't<00:03:22.300> work<00:03:22.540> so<00:03:22.720> great<00:03:22.930> because<00:03:23.710> if<00:03:23.950> you

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
doesn't work so great because if you

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.950 
doesn't work so great because if you
don't<00:03:24.400> open<00:03:25.050> these<00:03:26.050> out<00:03:26.470> to<00:03:27.160> press<00:03:27.780> they<00:03:28.780> would

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:28.960 
don't open these out to press they would

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.490 
don't open these out to press they would
be<00:03:29.080> locked<00:03:29.380> in<00:03:29.620> place<00:03:29.890> by<00:03:30.280> the<00:03:30.340> next<00:03:30.670> seeing<00:03:31.500> so

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
be locked in place by the next seeing so

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.560 
be locked in place by the next seeing so
that's<00:03:33.040> what<00:03:33.250> we<00:03:33.370> need<00:03:33.520> to<00:03:33.640> do<00:03:33.820> right<00:03:33.850> so<00:03:34.330> I'll

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
that's what we need to do right so I'll

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.020 
that's what we need to do right so I'll
get<00:03:34.720> these<00:03:34.870> the<00:03:35.410> last<00:03:36.100> two<00:03:36.430> you<00:03:36.610> need<00:03:36.730> four<00:03:37.000> for

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
get these the last two you need four for

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.630 
get these the last two you need four for
each<00:03:37.360> block<00:03:37.780> and<00:03:38.200> get<00:03:38.590> those<00:03:38.770> trimmed<00:03:39.160> off<00:03:39.340> for

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
each block and get those trimmed off for

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:40.680 
each block and get those trimmed off for
you<00:03:39.730> and<00:03:39.760> then<00:03:39.940> I'll<00:03:40.060> give<00:03:40.300> that<00:03:40.330> a<00:03:40.510> quick

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
press now when we pressing we want to

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.560 
press now when we pressing we want to
press<00:03:44.050> the<00:03:44.230> seams<00:03:44.530> to<00:03:44.800> the<00:03:45.040> out<00:03:45.510> towards<00:03:46.510> the

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
press the seams to the out towards the

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:52.290 
press the seams to the out towards the
outer<00:03:46.720> edge<00:03:47.460> all<00:03:48.460> right<00:03:50.490> set<00:03:51.490> our<00:03:51.670> seams<00:03:51.910> first

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:52.300 
outer edge all right set our seams first

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:58.300 
outer edge all right set our seams first
warm<00:03:53.080> up<00:03:53.200> those<00:03:53.410> fibers<00:03:53.800> then<00:03:54.010> open<00:03:54.400> the<00:03:54.490> Mount

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.820 

oh<00:03:58.690> that's<00:03:59.690> usually<00:04:00.140> where<00:04:00.290> people<00:04:00.560> want<00:04:00.739> to

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
oh that's usually where people want to

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.430 
oh that's usually where people want to
cut<00:04:01.040> corners<00:04:01.430> and<00:04:01.489> think<00:04:02.150> I'll<00:04:02.510> press<00:04:02.750> later

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
cut corners and think I'll press later

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.559 
cut corners and think I'll press later
it<00:04:04.040> just<00:04:04.340> helps<00:04:04.940> keep<00:04:05.000> a<00:04:05.330> nice<00:04:05.630> neat<00:04:06.349> um<00:04:07.569> system

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:08.569 
it just helps keep a nice neat um system

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:10.900 
it just helps keep a nice neat um system
if<00:04:08.780> you<00:04:08.900> press<00:04:09.440> in<00:04:09.620> between<00:04:09.950> so<00:04:10.340> now<00:04:10.550> what<00:04:10.790> we

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
if you press in between so now what we

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:15.729 
if you press in between so now what we
would<00:04:11.060> do<00:04:11.390> is<00:04:11.780> put<00:04:12.260> these<00:04:12.560> other<00:04:12.860> two<00:04:14.739> opposite

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
would do is put these other two opposite

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:18.460 
would do is put these other two opposite
corners<00:04:15.769> again<00:04:16.310> on<00:04:16.760> there<00:04:17.209> so<00:04:17.900> then<00:04:18.200> and

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
corners again on there so then and

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.620 
corners again on there so then and
there's<00:04:19.220> them<00:04:19.400> open<00:04:19.760> it<00:04:19.880> a<00:04:19.970> block<00:04:20.209> like<00:04:20.570> this

with these half blocks which will attach

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.820 
with these half blocks which will attach
on<00:05:06.050> so<00:05:06.289> you<00:05:06.350> can<00:05:06.590> see<00:05:06.620> I<00:05:07.450> turn<00:05:08.450> that<00:05:08.750> this<00:05:09.680> is
