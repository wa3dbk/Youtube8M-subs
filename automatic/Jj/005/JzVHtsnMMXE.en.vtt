00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 these are seven absurd innovations in 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.540
 Video games usually 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.340
 innovations in videogames arise to 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.530
 root of a need to improve or to 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.179
 offer something different the graphics and the 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.830
 gameplay are things that are always 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.150
 in constant evolution but what 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.730
 we will see here are all those contributions 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.710
 how to say it not only did not have 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.330
 success but they also were and are 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.560
 ridiculous the industry of the 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.689
 videogames is a monster that has 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.180
 grown much more than what years ago 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.340
 they could not even imagine and it's normal in 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.960
 part that start to come out new ideas 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.180
 in order to revolutionize the market and 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.440
 why not win some pasta for the 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.269
 path 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.969
 let's start then it 's ready in the post 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:40.559
 number 7 with the hamster goal his lips 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.149
 is the name that this device receives 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.219
 serves to play with your hamster of a 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.690
 very different way us through 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.100
 from the computer we can control the 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.600
 tube movement and what we will see 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.000
 through the screen is like a hamster 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.769
 giant is chasing us to kill us or 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.930
 to give us a tender hug you do not know 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:56.129
 very well your intentions and what happens 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.719
 in the real world is that the hamster 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.820
 pursues the tube because within it is 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.680
 food and thanks to the digitalization of 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.110
 land and the animal we can 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.190
 play some kind of pilla-pilla 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.869
 after this idea was presented 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.520
 they started to try it with other animals 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.020
 how can be the chicken in which 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.490
 you would have to flee from him through a 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.060
 labyrinth while he logically 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.399
 try to catch you 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.229
 in position number 6 we have nail and 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:19.939
 both this one and the one that we will see more 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.680
 forward they were based on the main idea 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:23.750
 to be able to play using an element 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.939
 that in principle nobody would take into account 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.619
 in this case without being 100% original 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:30.710
 we can see how they made a game on 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:32.060
 which one should be played screaming like that is if 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.799
 you're the kind of person who does not 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.810
 can restrain the urge to shit on 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:37.549
 the relatives of others this game 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.470
 It is ideal for you in your demonstration 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:40.880
 they presented this idea teaching how 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.229
 thanks to the screams could be made 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.810
 different things like eliminate 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:47.270
 obstacles or defeat enemies how many 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.950
 more decibels more damage the game was created 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.690
 to apply for a contest and they said 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.130
 that at first they had thought 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.810
 use sound in a way 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.090
 original combining it with the colors 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.370
 but that at the last moment this 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.770
 it seemed more fun 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:02.990
 in position number 5 we have new 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.340
 ways to play with life that kill you 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.870
 in call of duty or in any other 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.970
 game is not worrisome because at last and 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.619
 After no real lives at stake 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.990
 not be that the player is a deranged 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.490
 and I killed someone because of the anger is like 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.810
 be a stanford researchers 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.730
 they directed their efforts to find 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.430
 a way that the player could 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.600
 to manage a living being the good news is 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.280
 that the subjects we handle are 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.840
 microorganisms known as for 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.970
 means that we can usually 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.590
 find in backwaters and the way 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.160
 to play with them is simple but very 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.990
 effective 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.350
 the apparatus consists of the following 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.880
 parts a screen a camera a control 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.620
 and the paramecs on top of one 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.690
 structure that directs electricity 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.950
 different directions although I think that 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.690
 it is more correct to say that what 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.820
 we manage with the command is the change of 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.740
 polarity summarizing and explaining it from 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.360
 a simple way if we click above 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.100
 we will cause the parameters to go in 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.260
 that direction and so with the three 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.270
 remaining addresses with them we can 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.300
 play football to the bricks and to the 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.250
 pacman among others 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.800
 in position number 4 we have the 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.930
 urinary the idea of ​​using urinals to 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.340
 game mode is not novel a man 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.020
 transformed one with which you could 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.820
 control a racing game thanks to 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.620
 our urine and a few guys from the mid 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.570
 they did the same with some mini games 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.090
 but without a doubt who deserves more 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:15.190
 attention for being better elaborated are 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.810
 those that can be seen in Japanese before 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.700
 even that we think of 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.470
 build a urinal with the purpose 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.390
 of playing they had already built 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.880
 several versions with games also very 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:27.340
 own of them what do I mean you'll see 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.660
 have for example a game mode 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.820
 where the machine can measure the quantity 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.230
 and the intensity to then measure it with 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.820
 the next person and create from this 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.680
 way a kind of multiplayer where 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.690
 the person can beat the record 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.980
 previous or on the other hand have a 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.200
 simple minigame with which you can 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.950
 lift up her skirt as a girl 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.690
 that you throw the jet 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.390
 in position number 3 we have the 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.769
 auditory excitement date krumm sex is a 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.970
 game created by some students of 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:51.560
 copenhague with which only 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.330
 we will need the controllers of the 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.590
 wiki some speakers with these 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.330
 tools two players can 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.920
 enjoy a different experience already 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.930
 that as they are hitting with 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.610
 the fucking controller will hear a 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.989
 moan they said they eliminated the 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.970
 visual elements to force the 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:06.620
 player to use the imagination a 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.090
 erotic entertainment that could well 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.620
 get sold as a game for the 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.709
 couples or to laugh 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.150
 directly and there is no more what 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:15.650
 The only thing we can do is look at 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.989
 base of blows and if we do it very 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.850
 quick to ejaculate if with two people not 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.380
 you have enough includes a logy mode 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.900
 with which the two players compete 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:26.030
 by reaching the first to orgasm 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.040
 in position number 2 we have the tongue 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.300
 let's do a little review there 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.330
 hand controllers 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.410
 controllers with motion sensors 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.449
 controllers who use our urine 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:37.310
 and here we have the first driver 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:38.990
 for the language although it is not exactly 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.970
 for a single language but that is 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:43.430
 necessary a couple preferably 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:45.259
 human and if it is possible that it is alive 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.090
 controller rather it works with the 

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:48.860
 kisses through them can be measured 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.750
 the movements and in this way power 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.090
 play for example a game of bowling 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:55.130
 while you give the lot although it is a 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.810
 little weird to use the kisses do not you 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:59.330
 give as such but you must choose a 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:01.460
 position and keep it like this which leaves 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.840
 a rather strange feeling more than 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.729
 nothing because in what it takes to pull 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.190
 the bowl or mouths generate saliva and each 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:08.870
 time more and more and more and that ends up 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:10.699
 look like a morbid scene from a 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:13.409
 hentai but hey and nobody had asked 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:15.449
 so we can not complain either 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:17.669
 and finally in the position number 1 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:19.379
 we have the sound in the dark to 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:20.729
 to be fair and not to call absurd all 

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:22.409
 these contributions to the industry 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:24.089
 video game habilis tica we will see this 

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:26.339
 last innovation that can really 

00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:27.749
 bring something new or different I want that 

00:05:26.339 --> 00:05:29.369
 yes that we imagine this position 

00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:31.169
 always together with the oculus rif because 

00:05:29.369 --> 00:05:33.179
 I think both could get better 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:35.339
 advantage to the idea the game that we have 

00:05:33.179 --> 00:05:37.349
 in this position it is called tips and sea 

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:38.999
 deep and you play putting yourself in the 

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:40.769
 head this kind of gas mask 

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:42.089
 although you do not give much importance 

00:05:40.769 --> 00:05:44.519
 because the mask only has one 

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:46.169
 purpose of preventing us from seeing anything 

00:05:44.519 --> 00:05:47.999
 plays with sounds but not based on 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:49.379
 screams as we saw a while ago but 

00:05:47.999 --> 00:05:50.969
 we will have to eliminate the enemies 

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:53.099
 who surround us guiding us by the sound 

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:54.659
 with that on and through the helmets 

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:56.639
 we will hear monsters under the sea that 

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:58.139
 pass by our side we will know if you 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:06:00.179
 we have given because we can hear the 

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:02.669
 impact and if we fail we will only listen 

00:06:00.179 --> 00:06:03.989
 the torpedo walking away the creator said 

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:05.729
 who created it in order that 

00:06:03.989 --> 00:06:07.889
 it was claustrophobic irritant and 

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:09.689
 frustrating but although I do not see it as a 

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:11.249
 independent game if I imagine it 

00:06:09.689 --> 00:06:13.319
 as a level within a game more 

00:06:11.249 --> 00:06:17.120
 complex based on sounds game that 

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:19.070
 together with the oculus it would be interesting 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.560
 and nothing more family subscribe to the 

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:23.740
 milk you liked a kiss and until 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.740
 soon
