00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
the actual Technic power functions motor

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.189 
the actual Technic power functions motor
stuff<00:00:53.399> because<00:00:54.149> this<00:00:54.329> is<00:00:54.510> basically<00:00:54.899> how<00:00:55.170> you

helicopter<00:01:43.770> model<00:01:44.040> I<00:01:44.100> reviewed<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:44.549> couple

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
helicopter model I reviewed a couple

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.350 
helicopter model I reviewed a couple
videos<00:01:45.060> back<00:01:46.009> I'll<00:01:47.009> put<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.310> link<00:01:47.579> up<00:01:47.790> there<00:01:48.060> for

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
videos back I'll put a link up there for

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.800 
videos back I'll put a link up there for
that<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:49.490> but<00:01:50.490> yeah<00:01:50.700> this<00:01:50.880> motor<00:01:51.390> is<00:01:51.540> just

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
that and but yeah this motor is just

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.990 
that and but yeah this motor is just
terrible<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.710> mean<00:01:52.740> it<00:01:53.070> makes<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:53.430> horrible

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
terrible I mean it makes a horrible

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.870 
terrible I mean it makes a horrible
screeching<00:01:54.420> sound<00:01:54.899> you<00:01:55.049> turn<00:01:55.229> it<00:01:55.350> on<00:01:55.500> but<00:01:56.250> it's

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
screeching sound you turn it on but it's

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:57.980 
screeching sound you turn it on but it's
cool<00:01:57.090> because<00:01:57.210> you<00:01:57.360> can<00:01:57.509> see<00:01:57.719> all<00:01:57.840> the

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
cool because you can see all the

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.740 
cool because you can see all the
internal<00:01:58.469> stuff<00:01:59.009> on<00:01:59.189> it<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.430> it<00:02:00.000> actually<00:02:00.299> has

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
internal stuff on it and it actually has

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.800 
internal stuff on it and it actually has
a<00:02:00.780> power<00:02:01.110> supply<00:02:01.350> that<00:02:01.680> looks<00:02:01.890> like<00:02:02.100> this<00:02:02.810> so

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
a power supply that looks like this so

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.410 
a power supply that looks like this so
it<00:02:04.200> resembles<00:02:04.950> really<00:02:05.369> really<00:02:05.640> closely<00:02:05.939> to

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
it resembles really really closely to

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.869 
it resembles really really closely to
the<00:02:08.479> power<00:02:09.479> functions<00:02:09.959> battery<00:02:10.530> box<00:02:10.800> it's<00:02:11.760> got

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
the power functions battery box it's got

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.550 
the power functions battery box it's got
the<00:02:12.030> same<00:02:12.239> dimensions<00:02:12.840> in<00:02:12.989> all<00:02:13.140> but

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
the same dimensions in all but

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.670 
the same dimensions in all but
power<00:02:13.860> outlet<00:02:14.400> plug<00:02:14.790> is<00:02:15.090> different<00:02:15.660> and<00:02:15.870> the

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
power outlet plug is different and the

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
power outlet plug is different and the
actual<00:02:17.010> cables<00:02:17.610> for<00:02:17.940> this<00:02:18.180> or<00:02:18.620> for<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:20.250> the

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
actual cables for this or for the the

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.460 
actual cables for this or for the the
old<00:02:20.910> motor<00:02:21.620> looks<00:02:22.620> like<00:02:22.860> this<00:02:23.160> I<00:02:23.459> mean<00:02:24.470> the

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
old motor looks like this I mean the

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.820 
old motor looks like this I mean the
cables<00:02:26.190> don't<00:02:26.370> even<00:02:26.700> work<00:02:27.300> with<00:02:27.599> this<00:02:27.840> now<00:02:28.770> the

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
cables don't even work with this now the

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.559 
cables don't even work with this now the
good<00:02:29.220> thing<00:02:29.280> power<00:02:29.640> functions<00:02:30.060> has<00:02:30.269> done

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
good thing power functions has done

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.390 
good thing power functions has done
actually<00:02:30.930> is<00:02:31.349> they've<00:02:31.650> actually<00:02:31.860> enabled<00:02:32.310> a

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
actually is they've actually enabled a

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.070 
actually is they've actually enabled a
cord<00:02:32.940> I<00:02:33.090> don't<00:02:33.239> actually<00:02:33.390> have<00:02:33.599> it<00:02:33.750> here<00:02:33.870> to

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
cord I don't actually have it here to

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.900 
cord I don't actually have it here to
show<00:02:34.260> you<00:02:34.349> which<00:02:34.500> is<00:02:34.530> a<00:02:34.680> bummer<00:02:35.040> but<00:02:35.760> it

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
show you which is a bummer but it

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.850 
show you which is a bummer but it
actually<00:02:36.090> has<00:02:36.510> a<00:02:36.540> plug<00:02:37.080> that<00:02:37.200> looks<00:02:37.380> like<00:02:37.530> this

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
actually has a plug that looks like this

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.040 
actually has a plug that looks like this
and<00:02:39.110> one<00:02:40.110> of<00:02:40.200> these<00:02:40.380> outlets<00:02:41.069> right<00:02:41.280> here<00:02:42.050> it's

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
and one of these outlets right here it's

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.750 
and one of these outlets right here it's
sort<00:02:43.260> of<00:02:43.349> an<00:02:43.470> adapter<00:02:44.010> plug<00:02:44.310> and<00:02:44.519> it<00:02:44.580> actually

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
sort of an adapter plug and it actually

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.729 
sort of an adapter plug and it actually
enables<00:02:45.239> you<00:02:45.330> to<00:02:45.390> use<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:45.840> older<00:02:46.140> motors<00:02:46.470> with

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
enables you to use the older motors with

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.920 
enables you to use the older motors with
the<00:02:46.890> power<00:02:47.100> function<00:02:47.519> system<00:02:47.790> so<00:02:48.780> that

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
the power function system so that

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.650 
the power function system so that
actually<00:02:49.260> is<00:02:49.350> really<00:02:49.680> cool<00:02:50.030> now<00:02:51.030> aside<00:02:51.630> from

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
actually is really cool now aside from

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.990 
actually is really cool now aside from
the<00:02:51.900> older<00:02:52.260> motors<00:02:52.560> which<00:02:52.739> are<00:02:52.950> just<00:02:53.310> junk

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
the older motors which are just junk

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.600 
the older motors which are just junk
at<00:02:54.180> least<00:02:54.420> this<00:02:54.600> motor<00:02:54.810> is<00:02:55.100> the<00:02:56.100> buggy<00:02:56.340> motor

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
at least this motor is the buggy motor

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.280 
at least this motor is the buggy motor
is<00:02:56.730> really<00:02:57.000> a<00:02:57.030> wicked<00:02:57.450> cool<00:02:57.690> I<00:02:57.720> wish<00:02:58.049> I<00:02:58.140> could

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
is really a wicked cool I wish I could

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.670 
is really a wicked cool I wish I could
afford<00:02:58.380> that<00:02:58.680> but<00:02:59.480> I'll<00:03:00.480> to<00:03:00.840> invest<00:03:01.410> in<00:03:01.590> that

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
afford that but I'll to invest in that

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.070 
afford that but I'll to invest in that
in<00:03:01.830> the<00:03:01.920> later<00:03:02.099> time<00:03:02.450> anyway<00:03:03.450> moving<00:03:03.630> forward

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
in the later time anyway moving forward

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.110 
in the later time anyway moving forward
let's<00:03:04.349> just<00:03:04.590> move<00:03:04.769> all<00:03:04.950> this<00:03:05.069> off<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:05.459> off<00:03:05.849> the

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
years okay now to start off power

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.250 
years okay now to start off power
functions<00:03:18.060> when<00:03:18.180> it<00:03:18.329> was<00:03:18.480> introduced<00:03:18.989> in<00:03:19.170> the

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
functions when it was introduced in the

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.560 
functions when it was introduced in the
round<00:03:19.440> 2007<00:03:20.400> with<00:03:20.970> the<00:03:21.000> release<00:03:21.090> of<00:03:21.420> the

round 2007 with the release of the
Technic<00:03:22.370> 82-75<00:03:23.370> bulldozer<00:03:24.150> and<00:03:26.900> that<00:03:27.900> set<00:03:28.290> was

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
Technic 82-75 bulldozer and that set was

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.199 
Technic 82-75 bulldozer and that set was
really<00:03:28.920> popular<00:03:29.160> and<00:03:29.609> actually<00:03:29.910> helped

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
really popular and actually helped

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.080 
really popular and actually helped
boosted<00:03:30.840> the<00:03:30.989> power<00:03:31.019> functions<00:03:31.680> of

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
boosted the power functions of

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.370 
boosted the power functions of
popularity<00:03:33.090> so<00:03:33.870> I'm<00:03:33.959> going<00:03:34.079> to<00:03:34.140> set<00:03:34.260> the

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
popularity so I'm going to set the

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.240 
popularity so I'm going to set the
camera<00:03:34.530> down<00:03:34.709> right<00:03:35.130> now<00:03:35.280> and<00:03:36.890> I'll<00:03:37.890> just<00:03:38.010> put

this bad boy and your power source has a
green<00:03:54.660> light<00:03:54.690> that<00:03:55.170> signals<00:03:55.709> has<00:03:55.859> actually

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
green light that signals has actually

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.390 
green light that signals has actually
turned<00:03:56.489> on<00:03:56.760> and<00:03:57.090> a<00:03:57.690> power<00:03:57.959> outlet<00:03:58.290> plug<00:03:58.980> and

turned on and a power outlet plug and

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.550 
turned on and a power outlet plug and
you<00:04:00.060> can<00:04:00.239> attach<00:04:00.510> it<00:04:00.720> with<00:04:00.840> these<00:04:00.959> holes<00:04:01.260> here

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
you can attach it with these holes here

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.460 
you can attach it with these holes here
or<00:04:01.950> with<00:04:02.310> these<00:04:02.459> babies<00:04:03.030> right<00:04:03.060> here<00:04:03.470> so

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
or with these babies right here so

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.800 
or with these babies right here so
that's<00:04:04.650> that<00:04:04.859> the<00:04:05.730> simplest<00:04:06.090> way<00:04:06.299> to<00:04:06.329> power<00:04:06.690> a

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
that's that the simplest way to power a

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.099 
that's that the simplest way to power a
model<00:04:07.260> is<00:04:07.440> with<00:04:07.769> a<00:04:07.799> motor<00:04:08.540> this<00:04:09.540> actually

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.109 
model is with a motor this actually

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:13.129 
model is with a motor this actually
happens<00:04:10.590> to<00:04:10.739> be<00:04:10.859> the<00:04:11.040> medium<00:04:11.549> motor<00:04:11.790> or<00:04:12.120> the<00:04:12.180> M

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:13.139 
happens to be the medium motor or the M

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:15.500 
happens to be the medium motor or the M
motor<00:04:13.560> as<00:04:13.799> I<00:04:13.920> like<00:04:14.069> to<00:04:14.190> call<00:04:14.220> it<00:04:14.519> and<00:04:15.060> what<00:04:15.359> you

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
motor as I like to call it and what you

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.300 
motor as I like to call it and what you
can<00:04:15.540> do<00:04:15.810> to<00:04:15.930> power<00:04:16.139> this<00:04:16.350> thing<00:04:16.410> is<00:04:17.010> just

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
can do to power this thing is just

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.920 
can do to power this thing is just
simply<00:04:17.700> add<00:04:17.910> sound<00:04:18.450> like<00:04:18.630> that

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.140 

it<00:04:22.079> on<00:04:22.199> and

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
it on and

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:30.670 
it on and
now<00:04:24.720> that<00:04:25.229> little<00:04:25.380> guys<00:04:25.680> just<00:04:25.979> going<00:04:26.160> to<00:04:26.220> spin

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.740 

so<00:04:31.680> this<00:04:32.490> is<00:04:32.639> a<00:04:32.669> really<00:04:33.030> one<00:04:33.240> of<00:04:33.270> the<00:04:33.360> basic

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
so this is a really one of the basic

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.080 
so this is a really one of the basic
motors<00:04:33.990> that<00:04:34.139> Lego<00:04:34.290> has<00:04:34.470> released<00:04:34.860> since<00:04:35.850> its

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
motors that Lego has released since its

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.140 
motors that Lego has released since its
inception<00:04:36.540> and<00:04:37.340> it's<00:04:38.340> really<00:04:38.639> just<00:04:38.790> a<00:04:38.910> cool

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
inception and it's really just a cool

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.930 
inception and it's really just a cool
motor<00:04:39.389> so<00:04:39.990> in<00:04:40.370> addition<00:04:41.370> to<00:04:41.460> that<00:04:41.580> motor<00:04:41.790> that

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
motor so in addition to that motor that

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.460 
motor so in addition to that motor that
really<00:04:42.150> complements<00:04:42.780> this<00:04:42.930> motor<00:04:43.169> is<00:04:43.410> the

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
really complements this motor is the

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.060 
really complements this motor is the
excel<00:04:44.430> motor<00:04:44.729> this<00:04:45.600> motor<00:04:45.930> is<00:04:46.169> the<00:04:46.199> big<00:04:46.740> boy

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
excel motor this motor is the big boy

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.340 
excel motor this motor is the big boy
the<00:04:47.340> big<00:04:47.550> horse<00:04:47.910> of<00:04:48.150> the<00:04:48.240> whole<00:04:48.479> power

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
the big horse of the whole power

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.909 
the big horse of the whole power
functions<00:04:49.770> lineup<00:04:50.370> it<00:04:51.120> a<00:04:51.150> is<00:04:51.690> really<00:04:52.470> loud<00:04:52.710> and

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:52.919 
functions lineup it a is really loud and

00:04:52.919 --> 00:05:05.730 
functions lineup it a is really loud and
has<00:04:53.100> the<00:04:53.669> most<00:04:53.850> torque<00:04:54.240> out<00:04:54.389> of<00:04:54.510> all<00:04:54.660> of<00:04:54.870> them

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
so it is just a really really cool motor

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.820 
so it is just a really really cool motor
guys<00:05:10.870> I'm<00:05:11.870> actually<00:05:12.080> have<00:05:12.349> to<00:05:12.439> cut<00:05:12.589> the<00:05:12.710> video
