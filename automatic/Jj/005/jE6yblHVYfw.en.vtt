00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:16.830
 it's a little bit we find ourselves for 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.890
 a tutorial video and in this tutorial I 'm going 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.020
 show that one is well cleaning one's 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:26.640
 disappointing for only it's very 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:34.200
 simple we need water from the cleaner 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:38.059
 police and ten friends it is therefore in 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:43.230
 first game first the little cotton 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:46.440
 commissions and other nintendo ds and 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:52.230
 you see here there is a small flock 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:54.660
 say here in input the games so well 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.870
 sure it is necessary that your of it is necessary that 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.239
 your relaxation 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:11.450
 otherwise it can be dangerous so with 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:11.450
 the little cotton moments like that 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:21.170
 so we're going to pretend to be 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.800
 card detectors 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:34.140
 the price setting 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:40.230
 take a small side like this then 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:44.250
 after you take the cleaner for them 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:48.840
 oysters adjectives and you put some 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:56.970
 product then after abu know after you 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:02:01.100
 take your ds but your ds and then 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.100
 you make circular signs 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:26.330
 the friendly that everywhere else at the ski 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:37.260
 so after one if a apc 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:43.769
 you have to put it back here so I 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:48.090
 put back so I pass you the product that 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:52.709
 see the hand because you can throw the 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:55.980
 side graphics bin so here is the 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.360
 flaw your ds is a product that you 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.049
 say everything but how can we can 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:03.720
 even will be simple you pick up a little 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:10.250
 cotton and you prove me soaking it 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:10.250
 in the water here you will know it 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:25.290
 then after you take the ds is actually 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.290
 to emphasize circular 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:43.900
 we pass does not go behind 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:55.790
 So here at Fecamp is for you the 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:59.900
 throw back another one again 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:02.160
 then you go back could quote 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:06.510

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.570
 after that you have to clean the interior 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:48.050
