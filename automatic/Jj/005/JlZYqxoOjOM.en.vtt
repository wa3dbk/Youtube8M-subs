00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.509
 I welcome tankers 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:16.570
 many of you probably wondered 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:20.080
 how to raise the winning percentage 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:23.430
 just people in this video do not 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:26.789
 will be said and shown some 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.939
 nonexistent kind of scrapping game or 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.910
 one hundred percent 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:33.430
 recipe for success i will give you a few 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:37.230
 practical advice which in my opinion 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:40.600
 humble opinion will help you avoid 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.030
 common errors and fewer errors 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.730
 more frags more frags 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:49.900
 more sharpened battles and therefore 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:52.470
 more victories in principle given 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.940
 the manual is a bit like 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:58.780
 applicable and big tank 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:01.210
 but certain nuances still have so 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.260
 how fewer fighters play here 1st team 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.610
 therefore the price of each car 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.120
 are increasing 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:14.710
 hence the first advice not to merge 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:20.500
 first in this game especially if you are playing 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:23.320
 owls you can only count on 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:28.630
 yourself to no one else and no matter in 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:32.560
 top you or not you are a hero who owes 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.400
 drag each fight for it is not worth it 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.000
 first 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:39.850
 go it alone 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.700
 wait for reinforcements your death 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.650
 the beginning of the battle greatly reduce the chance 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.340
 to win 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:50.790
 from here you can extract the following say 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:54.140
 as a rule never go alone 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:57.780
 of an can win alone 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.810
 keep directions to whom and sense in 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:04.230
 this big is not so blitz only 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:07.110
 head-to-head combat and they are afraid of what they are going to 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:09.740
 the rear and seize your base is not worth the base 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:13.470
 always have time in the middle of the card 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:16.260
 if you are much more attentive 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:20.070
 will go along with the whole teams by 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:22.709
 one direction peter h with the whole team 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:28.190
 this game is much better 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:33.660
 typhus note the next item in this water 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:36.330
 this is to remove the shot by a nickname then something first 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:39.860
 deed are trying to teach commanders in 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:42.930
 clans of their soldiers special and wot blitz 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.130
 any tank let him have only one 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.900
 the percentage is solid 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:50.730
 can shoot carries a real threat 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:56.160
 so do not chase tabaga 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:58.440
 better less damage but with a frag yet 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.800
 one important moment 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:05.340
 school with a computer version is a mini 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:08.280
 the card should not be neglected information 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:11.010
 which she carries on the minimap 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.980
 you can find out where the main clusters 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.300
 enemies about which flank your help will be 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.490
 by the way 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:20.890
 especially the cards are small 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:23.800
 and on most tank you can 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:26.890
 promptly mix positions well and 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:29.370
 of course you can trace where it comes from 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:32.140
 expect an enemy hit 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:35.740
 minimap is a very powerful tool 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:39.340
 if you learn to use a few 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:41.710
 percent of such security but also 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:46.300
 last on my list but not at all 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:49.630
 the last overall is a game here two 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:52.210
 more or less spylog player can wear 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:55.510
 battles in which it would seem that all losses 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:57.780
 and for this neighbor is not necessarily 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:01.660
 make justice 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.320
 the main thing is to stick together and try 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:07.180
 focus 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:09.460
 one goal I most edge sleep but in 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.030
 I could not overcome alone 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:13.450
 frontier 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.850
 fifty six and a half percent but 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.070
 one day while there with a good player 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:23.080
 I achieved 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:24.130
 57 and this despite the fact that I have more 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.370
 two thousand battles 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:30.640
 one loss of 10 fights, I think 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:35.760
 great result so add 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:38.320
 currently playing friends more or less skills and 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.930
 forward 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.810
 Well, I think that these tips 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:48.400
 enough to raise the percentage 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.970
 wins at least up to 10 3 and maybe 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.570
 above 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:56.880
 let's recall the main points and so 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:05:00.820
 the first does not merge at the beginning of the battle 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:07.050
 the second is never to go because 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:10.800
 on the flank of the third clean up the understock 4 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:15.030
 monitor the situation on the minimap 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:18.340
 5 play more cocked 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:22.240
 I hope this video was for you 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:24.640
 helpful write comments if it was 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.820

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:30.700
 my arguments 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:35.500
 like and subscribe to the channel 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:37.560
