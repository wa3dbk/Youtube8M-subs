00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 that minutes we are at four days 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.460
 of the year spain france 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.080
 qualifiers for the world cup 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.330
 2014 which will take place in Brazil 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.980
 good evening bixente good evening scene you have 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.160
 Christians and tonight we are entitled to a 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.540
 dress rehearsal against Japan ago 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.970
 lessons to be drawn inevitably 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.369
 evening bixente this Japanese team is going 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.820
 to be quite playful as the team 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.199
 spain 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.970
 it will obviously be a team of less 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.800
 good quality that spain thinks that 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.449
 for didier deschamps is in me them 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.099
 automatisms because it's the team of 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.199
 France she has little experience she has 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.329
 little played together especially with with 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.130
 this team and then also the management 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.840
 physical of the players that are going to be 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.290
 preserved before this match as franck 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.300
 Ribery 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.129
 and then other words that will maybe 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.629
 go out during the game as karim 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.460
 benzema did not badly played these last 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.899
 time 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.280
 arsene this Japanese team we 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.500
 knows little 40 finishes football 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.820
 Asian and they invade Europe 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.770
 step by step 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.329
 good evening gentlemen good evening to laurent what 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.010
 was the speech of didier deschamps 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:59.199
 before this friendly match against Japan 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.980
 it's already the dress rehearsal before 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:02.829
 the match in spain 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:05.600
 yeah that's right I can not on a 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:08.640
 bench before the appointment of Tuesday 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.290
 we respect this Japanese team 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.770
 but in front we are winning this match 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.479
 so we are implementing tonight for nothing 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.979
 and still makes relative to this 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.050
 central defense didier deschamps va 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.190
 do tests and then goes on necessarily from 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.380
 find the right formula 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.850
 another test tonight Bixente it comes to 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.550
 the tip of the attack with karim 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.759
 benzema that will end up on the side 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.440
 left 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.970
 we saw it on the right in the sense of the sags 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.770
 here is that it's a bit like that karim 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.420
 benzema who walks on the front of 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.310
 the then talented attacker he is 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.900
 able to evolve on the right side 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.190
 as against the belarus or on the 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.409
 left side he did a lot with 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.170
 lions with the real also sometimes they 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.390
 were a little bit exported on the on 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.460
 the ideal formula side is the one where 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.899
 the three attackers are working well 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.759
 together we will see what it will give 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.369
 with olive giroud tip - with 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.960
 jérémy ménez on the right side 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.490
 france japan the last time the 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.369
 Japanese had played in this stage of 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.929
 France in 2001 he conceded 5 goals 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.490
 who sang but it's history 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:03.390
 old of a japanese in some 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.060
 minutes it is 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.360
 3h45 to Tokyo is at night for this 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.360
 match 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.080
 me it's not their equal for Japan and 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:16.130
 this game from elsewhere in Japan will be 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:18.680

 moore 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.330
 3:54 to be precise obviously 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.600
 Oh 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.030

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.950
 this national team sung by 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.790

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.790
 milan ac that was 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.030
 and there are nearly fifty thousand people 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:23.370
 are at the Stade de France 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:25.760
 with this Marseillaise interpreted by 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:28.320
 the Republican Guard 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:31.139
 we will discover in a few seconds 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:34.130
 the composition of the teams we had you 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:37.080
 unveiled two important tactical points 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:39.830
 before the hymns we will see her in the 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.120
