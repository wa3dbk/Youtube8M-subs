 tent structures 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.649
 used as pig farms 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.460
 for growing animals by canadian 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.370
 technology 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.929
 due to the fact that pork production in 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.360
 the captain on the premises is 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.340
 energy-intensive production

 production cost in market 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.090
 conditions are being searched for energy and

 resource saving methods of content 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.350
 animals of one of the alternative

 technology keeping pigs 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.130
 is the so -called Canadian 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.710
 cold technology or method 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.930
 content the essence of technology is that 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.880
 animals placed unheated hangar 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.000
 which is a metal 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.739
 frameworks awning coverings in such 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.780
 indoors pigs contain large 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.300
 homogeneous groups in deep 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.340
 non-replaceable bedding will be fed dry 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.370
 balanced feed 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.079
 free access by prying 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.000
 the whole secret of cold keeping is stronger 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.280
 is that the base 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.140
 will cover a large salon which 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.090
 as a result of rotting forms a floor with 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.680
 heated 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.539
 resulting in composting the mixture 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.760
 manure litter temperature on 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.030
 surface ranges from 5 to 15 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.430
 degrees using Canadian technology 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:16.040
 provides an average daily gain 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:18.390
 livestock from 750 to 900 grams per day 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.590
 frame tent construction it 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.100
 cost effective way 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.650
 light pig farm construction throughput 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.990
 the ability of this coating provides 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.880
 good natural light so 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.369
 way of additional electric lighting 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.549
 not required except at night and on duty 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.470
 light compared to traditional 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.970
 stationary buildings these 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.810
 designs possesses the most important 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.850
 advantage 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.130
 low cost price as well 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.659
 possibility of quick dismantling 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.110
 structures and building it on a new 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.810
 place 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.390
 This is especially important for carrying 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.890
 general disinfection experience of many 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.680
 farms that have used 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.689
