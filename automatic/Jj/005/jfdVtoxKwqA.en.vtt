00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
a lot more differently and that in the

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.180 
a lot more differently and that in the
past<00:02:17.010> and<00:02:17.370> it<00:02:17.490> gives<00:02:17.670> you<00:02:17.790> more<00:02:18.000> variety<00:02:18.180> in

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.570 
feel more weird and it feels like it
feels<00:04:03.690> a<00:04:03.900> lot<00:04:04.080> more<00:04:04.140> can<00:04:04.620> like<00:04:05.070> you're<00:04:05.280> sucked

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
feels a lot more can like you're sucked

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.010 
feels a lot more can like you're sucked
into<00:04:05.760> animations<00:04:06.480> and<00:04:06.660> stuff<00:04:06.840> it<00:04:06.990> just

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.020 
into animations and stuff it just

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.050 
into animations and stuff it just
doesn't<00:04:07.530> feel<00:04:07.680> realistic<00:04:08.040> kind<00:04:08.700> of<00:04:08.790> like<00:04:08.910> it

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
doesn't feel realistic kind of like it

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.570 
doesn't feel realistic kind of like it
did<00:04:09.330> in<00:04:09.360> previous<00:04:09.930> best<00:04:10.410> games<00:04:10.680> i<00:04:10.830> mean<00:04:10.980> it<00:04:11.310> did

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
did in previous best games i mean it did

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:16.070 
did in previous best games i mean it did
feel<00:04:11.850> a<00:04:12.090> lot<00:04:12.750> more<00:04:13.200> can<00:04:13.920> and<00:04:14.810> unrealistic<00:04:15.810> and

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.080 
feel a lot more can and unrealistic and

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.750 
feel a lot more can and unrealistic and
for<00:04:16.230> your<00:04:16.320> FIFA's<00:04:16.739> engine<00:04:17.130> actually<00:04:17.459> felt

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
for your FIFA's engine actually felt

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.090 
for your FIFA's engine actually felt
like<00:04:17.940> physics<00:04:18.480> I'm<00:04:18.600> not<00:04:18.750> gonna<00:04:19.020> live<00:04:19.200> I<00:04:19.530> i<00:04:19.590> I've

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
like physics I'm not gonna live I i I've

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.159 
like physics I'm not gonna live I i I've
made<00:04:20.400> a<00:04:20.430> suggestion<00:04:20.790> about<00:04:21.000> that<00:04:21.420> that<00:04:21.930> pass

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
made a suggestion about that that pass

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.140 
made a suggestion about that that pass
need<00:04:22.380> to<00:04:22.500> improve<00:04:22.830> your<00:04:23.040> physics<00:04:23.370> engine<00:04:23.760> you

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
need to improve your physics engine you

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.670 
need to improve your physics engine you
know<00:04:24.300> so<00:04:24.510> that<00:04:24.540> the<00:04:24.870> collisions<00:04:25.260> can<00:04:25.470> look<00:04:25.620> a

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
know so that the collisions can look a

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.390 
know so that the collisions can look a
lot<00:04:25.800> better<00:04:26.010> because<00:04:26.160> I

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
lot better because I

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.150 
lot better because I
feel<00:04:26.520> like<00:04:26.669> the<00:04:26.759> collisions<00:04:27.240> was<00:04:27.389> so<00:04:27.660> bad

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
feel like the collisions was so bad

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.129 
feel like the collisions was so bad
impact<00:04:29.160> but<00:04:29.580> you<00:04:30.270> know<00:04:30.419> that's<00:04:30.930> something

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:31.139 
impact but you know that's something

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:34.189 
impact but you know that's something
that<00:04:31.290> they<00:04:31.500> need<00:04:31.710> to<00:04:31.860> work<00:04:32.100> on<00:04:32.370> but<00:04:33.150> no<00:04:33.870> this<00:04:34.080> is

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:34.199 
that they need to work on but no this is

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:36.080 
that they need to work on but no this is
basically<00:04:34.530> was<00:04:34.800> saying<00:04:34.919> like<00:04:35.430> he's<00:04:35.699> also

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
basically was saying like he's also

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.629 
basically was saying like he's also
saying<00:04:36.419> that<00:04:36.570> has<00:04:37.229> offered<00:04:37.770> more<00:04:37.979> for<00:04:38.160> Arkady

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639 
saying that has offered more for Arkady

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:41.120 
saying that has offered more for Arkady
field<00:04:39.060> then<00:04:39.810> FIFA<00:04:40.229> which<00:04:40.410> is<00:04:40.530> interesting

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
field then FIFA which is interesting

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:42.260 
field then FIFA which is interesting
because<00:04:41.160> I<00:04:41.400> always<00:04:41.669> thought<00:04:41.820> that<00:04:41.880> test

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
because I always thought that test

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.870 
because I always thought that test
actually<00:04:42.810> had<00:04:43.080> more<00:04:43.380> for<00:04:43.770> simulation<00:04:44.639> field

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
actually had more for simulation field

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.180 
actually had more for simulation field
so<00:04:44.970> I<00:04:45.000> kind<00:04:45.270> of<00:04:45.300> disagree<00:04:45.449> with<00:04:45.870> that<00:04:45.900> but<00:04:46.860> it

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
so I kind of disagree with that but it

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.670 
so I kind of disagree with that but it
does<00:04:47.460> say<00:04:47.759> that<00:04:47.970> people<00:04:48.240> peaceful<00:04:49.229> gameplay

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
does say that people peaceful gameplay

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.490 
does say that people peaceful gameplay
mechanics<00:04:50.220> are<00:04:50.340> more<00:04:50.520> intricate<00:04:51.090> and<00:04:51.500> appeal

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
mechanics are more intricate and appeal

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.520 
mechanics are more intricate and appeal
more<00:04:53.100> to<00:04:53.160> realize<00:04:53.850> football<00:04:54.300> so<00:04:54.600> that's<00:04:55.350> what

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
more to realize football so that's what

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.140 
more to realize football so that's what
he's<00:04:55.650> saying<00:04:55.919> right<00:04:56.039> here<00:04:56.190> there's<00:04:56.759> also<00:04:57.000> a

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
he's saying right here there's also a

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.120 
he's saying right here there's also a
power<00:04:57.449> meter<00:04:57.690> that<00:04:58.050> accomplished<00:04:58.680> every<00:04:58.919> pass

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
power meter that accomplished every pass

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:04.550 
power meter that accomplished every pass
or<00:04:59.370> shot<00:04:59.580> ah<00:05:00.800> but<00:05:01.800> it<00:05:02.780> but<00:05:03.780> he's<00:05:04.020> also<00:05:04.199> saying

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
or shot ah but it but he's also saying

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.610 
or shot ah but it but he's also saying
that<00:05:05.240> it<00:05:06.240> does<00:05:06.539> help<00:05:06.810> you<00:05:06.960> to<00:05:07.110> better<00:05:07.320> control

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
that it does help you to better control

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.820 
that it does help you to better control
your<00:05:08.430> play<00:05:08.699> but<00:05:09.389> takes<00:05:09.660> away<00:05:10.050> some<00:05:10.680> of<00:05:10.740> the

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
your play but takes away some of the

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.800 
your play but takes away some of the
natural<00:05:10.979> flow<00:05:11.430> found<00:05:11.699> and<00:05:11.910> people<00:05:12.270> so<00:05:12.479> that's

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
natural flow found and people so that's

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.529 
natural flow found and people so that's
interesting<00:05:13.680> so<00:05:14.010> some<00:05:14.760> people<00:05:15.030> asking<00:05:15.510> about

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:15.539 
interesting so some people asking about

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:18.200 
interesting so some people asking about
all<00:05:15.870> this<00:05:16.020> information<00:05:16.430> you<00:05:17.430> know<00:05:17.550> you<00:05:17.610> also

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
all this information you know you also

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:19.700 
all this information you know you also
spoke<00:05:18.599> about<00:05:18.630> the<00:05:19.080> fact<00:05:19.320> that<00:05:19.380> there's<00:05:19.620> a

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
spoke about the fact that there's a

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.250 
spoke about the fact that there's a
return<00:05:20.070> of<00:05:20.250> the<00:05:20.370> match<00:05:20.699> replays<00:05:21.270> system<00:05:21.990> where

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260 
return of the match replays system where

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.820 
return of the match replays system where
that's<00:05:22.710> what<00:05:22.949> to<00:05:23.070> show<00:05:23.340> a<00:05:23.750> large<00:05:24.750> cut<00:05:25.349> of<00:05:25.380> the

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
that's what to show a large cut of the

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.300 
that's what to show a large cut of the
actual<00:05:26.449> replay<00:05:27.449> right<00:05:27.780> like<00:05:28.380> this<00:05:28.889> replays

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
actual replay right like this replays

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.040 
actual replay right like this replays
after<00:05:29.610> every<00:05:29.910> single<00:05:30.270> play<00:05:30.479> and<00:05:30.690> stuff<00:05:30.900> like

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
after every single play and stuff like

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.140 
after every single play and stuff like
that<00:05:31.110> and<00:05:31.289> like<00:05:31.919> whenever<00:05:32.490> you<00:05:32.699> score<00:05:32.910> a<00:05:32.940> goal

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
that and like whenever you score a goal

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.120 
that and like whenever you score a goal
black<00:05:33.419> tights<00:05:33.690> will<00:05:33.900> show<00:05:34.050> like<00:05:34.229> a<00:05:34.260> large<00:05:34.710> cut

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.130 
black tights will show like a large cut

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:38.120 
black tights will show like a large cut
off<00:05:35.669> the<00:05:36.210> goal<00:05:36.419> so<00:05:36.780> it's<00:05:36.960> like<00:05:37.289> 15<00:05:37.919> minutes

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.130 
off the goal so it's like 15 minutes

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.159 
off the goal so it's like 15 minutes
before<00:05:38.490> the<00:05:38.550> goals<00:05:38.760> actually<00:05:39.180> scored<00:05:39.630> like

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:40.169 
before the goals actually scored like

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:41.930 
before the goals actually scored like
pets<00:05:40.500> were<00:05:40.650> like<00:05:40.860> show<00:05:41.160> that<00:05:41.370> just<00:05:41.400> like<00:05:41.760> in

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 
pets were like show that just like in

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.240 
pets were like show that just like in
previous<00:05:42.120> years<00:05:42.360> and<00:05:42.960> he<00:05:43.620> basically<00:05:43.919> says

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
previous years and he basically says

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.270 
previous years and he basically says
it's<00:05:44.940> annoying<00:05:45.360> so<00:05:45.780> but<00:05:46.680> I<00:05:46.710> don't<00:05:47.010> think<00:05:47.159> it's

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 
it's annoying so but I don't think it's

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.980 
it's annoying so but I don't think it's
on<00:05:47.370> the<00:05:47.460> way<00:05:47.520> I<00:05:47.550> think<00:05:47.669> it's<00:05:47.970> okay<00:05:48.270> but<00:05:48.330> you

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:48.990 
on the way I think it's okay but you

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.320 
on the way I think it's okay but you
know<00:05:49.110> everybody<00:05:49.560> and<00:05:49.860> Todd<00:05:50.190> CEO<00:05:50.460> infinii<00:05:50.940> but

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:51.330 
know everybody and Todd CEO infinii but

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.080 
know everybody and Todd CEO infinii but
that's<00:05:51.900> why<00:05:52.110> i<00:05:52.139> think<00:05:52.500> but<00:05:52.710> anyways<00:05:53.639> how<00:05:53.729> great
