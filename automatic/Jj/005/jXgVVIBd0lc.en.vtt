important<00:01:49.619> we've<00:01:49.740> got<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:49.920> position<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.460> horse

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
important we've got a position a horse

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.960 
important we've got a position a horse
to<00:01:51.540> jump<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.869> jump<00:01:52.049> so<00:01:52.740> our<00:01:53.220> focus<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:53.909> our

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
to jump the jump so our focus and our

to jump the jump so our focus and our
eyeline<00:01:54.509> is<00:01:54.810> so<00:01:55.590> so<00:01:55.829> so<00:01:56.070> important<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:57.479> again

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
eyeline is so so so important and again

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.200

to<00:01:57.899> get<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.170> data<00:01:58.380> from<00:01:59.189> that<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.640> be<00:01:59.790> able<00:01:59.880> to

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
to get the data from that to be able to

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:06.109 
to get the data from that to be able to
give<00:02:01.020> other<00:02:01.950> riders<00:02:02.460> a<00:02:02.700> more<00:02:03.630> conclusive<00:02:05.119> idea

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
of where they should be focusing what

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.729 
of where they should be focusing what
the<00:02:07.950> top<00:02:08.550> riders<00:02:08.879> do<00:02:09.090> and<00:02:09.989> also<00:02:10.200> be<00:02:10.530> able<00:02:10.619> to

the top riders do and also be able to
see<00:02:11.060> if<00:02:12.060> you<00:02:12.300> like<00:02:12.480> slight<00:02:12.900> flaw

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
see if you like slight flaw

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.559 
see if you like slight flaw
in<00:02:14.220> certain<00:02:14.519> riders<00:02:14.940> as<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.209> where<00:02:15.360> their

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
in certain riders as to where their

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.210 
in certain riders as to where their
focus<00:02:15.959> might<00:02:16.140> be<00:02:16.319> I<00:02:16.530> think<00:02:16.799> this<00:02:17.040> is<00:02:17.190> very

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
focus might be I think this is very

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.580 
focus might be I think this is very
important<00:02:17.819> I<00:02:18.060> think<00:02:18.330> technology<00:02:19.170> with<00:02:19.319> with
