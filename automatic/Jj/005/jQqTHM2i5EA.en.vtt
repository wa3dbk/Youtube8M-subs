00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:17.720
 Nathalie, please. This time we released version 4.4, so now. 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:21.410
 I'm now in agreement with Nestle. 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:28.160
 Four to go to Key Castle 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:32.239
 You know you're going in alphabetical order. This is a 4.4 k 4 ticket. 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:37.010
 This seemed a little difficult . 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:44.319
 Gyeongju encountered me. I usually went to play . 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:44.319
 If you go and buy a box, you know, but you brushed it now 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:53.360
 No, I did not win a seat . 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:57.080
 So now I'm a mentor . 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:01:00.590
 Give me a little example of an app kick. 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:05.900
 First requirement is now 50 people that are now the focus mom 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:11.510

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:15.740

 I have been ds and I sold it to One Plus One 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:25.160
 Yes, there is not this. 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:29.960
 But if you use it as a commemorative launching ceremony, 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:33.080
 The heap is up to the 32th of the month. 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:39.850
 The soup is out of focus. 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:39.850

 What about all the time and do jyeoteum now also focus was something out 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:59.790
 For example, if there is a code inside, 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:02.550
 That I do is to access through a qr code or not this url 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:06.660
 Would you be an infant? 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:11.280

 I'll get sodium bicarbonate. 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:48.590

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.950

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:10.780
 I did not do it because I wanted to eat it like this. 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:15.410
 4 First of all, if you look like this, 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:20.870

 Then remove lead me coming 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:37.299

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.959

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:05.530

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:17.139
 It's a ceremony . 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:23.650
 And then you listen to your personal information. This is not it. 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:28.900

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:37.990
 Because of my request, I bought 24 boxes over 3 boxes. 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:43.690
 But I have not won anything yet , and I'm going to wipe it off now. 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:48.490
 I knew it all at once. 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:51.870
 It was not a bee, but now I put it in the freezer and eat it and I can not eat it. 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:58.440
