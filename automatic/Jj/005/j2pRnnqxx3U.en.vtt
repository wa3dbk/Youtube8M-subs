00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:13.530
 hey people mark block here in this 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.839
 Video I want you a little video 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.760
 give specifically to this the headset 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:22.650
 asus cerberus headset what i got from 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.359
 have been asked many at the 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.019
 location 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:26.699
 and yes I have it now too 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.220
 bit tested here the headset 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.090
 few days a week and I want it 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.910
 just fine a little bit my 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.140
 give feedback to the headset and 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.829
 such a small video just synonymous 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.879
 Let's start and start it 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.210
 Here a bit with the mother 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.829
 construction method so how is built headset 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.760
 like I usually do from headsets 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.370
 it's a bit like now 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.770
 different and you have one here 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.510
 elastic band up here that I just 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.789
 your head fits so that means like 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.949
 I imagine something here now 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.920
 can and it remains a position in the 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.780
 position but I fit just 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.840
 individually to each head directly 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.739
 no matter what on now puts out her 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.689
 already see up there 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.150
 I hope we can see it tense 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:13.500
 already and fits directly on the head 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.030
 so on it then I think the color 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.490
 and the color combination is cool 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.799
 Fitted with asus and this rock republic 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.060
 on gamer a bit and not one 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.820
 bit fits in any case and 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.439
 Although this black and red I like it so 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.439
 simply receives also likes 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.880
 cool here with this red accent 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.490
 line that is here I think so too 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.970
 that asus logo is also very discreet 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.920
 appropriate and yes from the outset easy 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.020
 So let's just say it for mine 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.000
 relationships or what I do about it now 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.140
 think of mnz he is son 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.020
 beginner headset yes it is not now 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:51.000
 high end dj gaming headset but is 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.680
 it's just an enhanced headset 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.880
 where I think I could take you 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.460
 on lan party 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.040
 you want to show that you are on 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.070
 to take girlfriend to play for 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.800
 listening to music just for a bit 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:07.020
 switch off yes so it is now 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:09.720
 so my my attitude to 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.460
 headset then it has one more here 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.620
 Microphone that you can take off you can 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:17.300
 Just put it in here too 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.440
 completely normal 3.5 mm jack connection 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.000
 The microphone could be here a bit 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.800
 bend ever want to have after what 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.320
 the employee below or i show 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:29.190
 give it back here so directly 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:31.370
 in front of your mouth or down here depending on how 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.050
 it would like to bend 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.580
 I'm just scared of such things 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.830
 I also had something like that on my old one 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.390
 Remember that if it weighs often 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.400
 that i am just this rubber this 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.420
 Sheath breaks and travels and then 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.130
 at some point maybe the 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.600
 cable gets damaged in it i know it 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.980
 I do not want the thing now, too 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.230
 do not look up so good 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.610
 the cables are protected but that is 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.600
 I just noticed my old one 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.000
 I would have that at the time unfortunately 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:57.420
 happened and that's why you have here 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.760
 below a clip on the jan t shirts 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.590
 You can do holy et cetera on it 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.709
 Do you have an internal microphone here ? 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.120
 I'm going to build it now 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:07.530
 that's in here in this 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.459
 this part, I also think I've 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.060
 I do not see it now either 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.239
 very cool 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:15.360
 you still have courage here with the 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:17.700
 microphone just louder louder just 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.430
 could you then here you have one more 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.170
 volume control to a scope of delivery 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.160
 it was still here was the cable 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.290
 Actually, that's actually how it is 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.880
 quite short for such a headset cable say 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.540
 I just like that now 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.680
 I'm used to 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:34.350
 then you have an alternative here or 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.570
 alternative cable adapter is indeed 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.959
 This cable adapter is there for you 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.610
 the headset with your smartphone or 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.620
 can use with your tablet just 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.830
 the built-in microphone we take 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.880
 now the microphone out 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.280
 smartphone would plug in now or 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.989
 tablet then you can here 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.910
 This microphone with used and 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.739
 So then it is something like one 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:59.940
 Handsfree then for yours 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:01.160
 tablet smartphone should be us 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.330
 microphones back in 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.950
 then you have a bigger one 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:08.100
 extension just got that again 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.230
 This is already quite long here 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:13.500
 cable so one 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:15.150
 can you join your club and 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.829
 then you can use these two cables here 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.750
 connect your pc once here and 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:20.009
 microphone and for the headphones that you 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.810
 just the headphones normal on the pc 

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:25.020
 could use yes I pull now 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.639
 times the cable long and quite a long time 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.620
 In any case make us here 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:29.370
 difference and the range is up 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.780
 every case higher now 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.789
 you are not in any way now 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.710
 small short wired by the 

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:37.320
 Processing I say it is it 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.060
 okay for the price is it can 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.650
 You can not do this anymore 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.349
 I can not find earcups unfortunately 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:47.250
 soft we are a bit tough this 

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:49.020
 Earpads here are a bit hard and me 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.460
 Generally, it has everything now 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.680
 nothing to do with asus or anything I like 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:56.400
 I generally do these rounds or 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:59.340
 I do not like half round ear bells though 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:03.419
 I have pretty big ears 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:07.080
 and then a while that fit 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:09.150
 inside but not as comfortable as it should be 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.370
 I say the thing would have been mine too 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.500
 be a little bit thicker 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.419
 so that the ears can be sheathed nicely 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.340
 and I just think that 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:19.680
 has now with a price question 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.720
 to do between higher quality 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.280
 headsets from asus which of course the 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.289
 then meet the whole criteria 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.780
 I personally find it important in too 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:30.240
 sometimes when you are short when you are 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:31.919
 would need and there is now no 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.750
 the big budget and check it out 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:35.909
 a cheap headset for the price 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.440
 mean you can definitely her 

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:39.270
 open so yes we open 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.889
 in any case, nothing wrong so as I said 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.720
 I'm just used to other things 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:46.199
 It was important to me from the beginning 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:48.090
 that I have a sturdy and more durable 

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:49.460
 setup and just a more comfortable tells 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:51.840
 I of course that is also convenient but 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:54.720
 my would have it until now my first 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.849
 180 euros and the new I know 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.169
 now user is also not cheap and 

00:05:56.849 --> 00:06:00.900
 Of course, you also notice that 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:02.849
 difference to those mentioned 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.889
 headsets that now here again to 

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:07.080
 say is a stereo headset so no 

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:09.780
 5.1 10.1 but quite normal is easy 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:12.060
 stereo headset and 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:14.250
 I have no pain now 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:15.300
 had the long wear so it has 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:18.120
 not hurt 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:19.560
 nowhere comfortable you barely notice 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:23.280
 the head is not too heavy not so 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:25.050
 easy I have no problems with it 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:27.710
 so i have had it long enough and 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:30.540
 tested enough on the smartphone 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:32.760
 synonymous s.pc but of course come on the pc 

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:35.490
 completely different a completely different quality 

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:36.900
 accomplished with such a headset one 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:39.900
 sound card or the mainboard much more 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:42.450
 Power great power on to the headphones 

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:44.610
 could forward would be a small 

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:46.830
 smartphone or tablet and that's why 

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:49.440
 it definitely s.pc a difference 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:52.230
 Audible microphone is of the quality 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:53.340
 also okay is also ok has none 

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:54.930
 I have now also in the 

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:57.210
 teamspeak of course the microphone 

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:58.680
 tried and was no rush to 

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:00.510
 I do not hear any problems . I realize that 

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.979
 and clearly understood that, of course 

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:03.410
 the most important one microphone not that 

00:07:01.979 --> 00:07:05.640
 it looks nice or that it looks 

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:07.440
 but has any additional features 

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:09.630
 just that you understand one well 

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:11.910
 That's the way it works 

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:13.500
 so from the reviews of this headset 

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:15.560
 for my impressions I had 

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:17.610
 I hope you liked the video 

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:19.320
 I would be happy about the thumb 

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:20.940
 Of course, all important information will be in 

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.740
 the video description with in the box 

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:24.240
 that if you ask nor any 

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:26.520
 have naturally cleared only once 

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:29.340
 or you just into a pn or 

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:31.050

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.190
 Really very happy for trust 

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:40.500
