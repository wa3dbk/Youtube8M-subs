that<00:03:22.659> I<00:03:23.310> made<00:03:24.310> up<00:03:24.459> myself<00:03:25.620> to<00:03:26.620> make<00:03:26.769> it<00:03:26.890> look<00:03:27.129> as

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
that I made up myself to make it look as

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:41.399 
that I made up myself to make it look as
original<00:03:27.849> as<00:03:28.239> possible<00:03:39.329> but<00:03:40.329> this<00:03:40.870> here<00:03:41.260> it

00:03:41.399 --> 00:03:41.409 
original as possible but this here it

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:44.970 
original as possible but this here it
just<00:03:41.530> seems<00:03:41.769> like<00:03:41.890> they're<00:03:42.310> the<00:03:42.519> haves<00:03:42.760> and
