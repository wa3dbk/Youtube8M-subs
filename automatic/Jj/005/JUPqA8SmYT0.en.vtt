00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
black silver and red however I have to

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.429

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
windows could have been better if they

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.279 
windows could have been better if they
were<00:00:25.680> like<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.359> semi-transparent<00:00:27.359> plastic<00:00:28.170> as

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
were like a semi-transparent plastic as

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.980 
were like a semi-transparent plastic as
opposed<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.279> solid<00:00:29.849> color<00:00:30.119> like<00:00:30.420> red<00:00:30.449> here

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
opposed to a solid color like red here

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.530 
opposed to a solid color like red here
I'm<00:00:31.560> not<00:00:31.740> really<00:00:31.890> a<00:00:32.009> big<00:00:32.130> fan<00:00:32.160> when<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.969> toy

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
I'm not really a big fan when the toy

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.680 
I'm not really a big fan when the toy
designers<00:00:33.989> use<00:00:34.290> solid<00:00:34.739> colors<00:00:35.010> like<00:00:35.190> this<00:00:35.690> it

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
designers use solid colors like this it

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.420 
designers use solid colors like this it
doesn't<00:00:36.870> look<00:00:36.989> bad<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:37.590> just<00:00:37.649> looked<00:00:38.070> it<00:00:38.309> would

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
doesn't look bad it just looked it would

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.760 
doesn't look bad it just looked it would
just<00:00:38.670> look<00:00:38.730> better<00:00:38.969> I<00:00:39.120> think<00:00:39.270> with<00:00:39.600> a

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:39.770 
just look better I think with a

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.830 
just look better I think with a
semi-transparent<00:00:40.770> plastic<00:00:41.610> as<00:00:41.790> opposed<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.750> a

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
semi-transparent plastic as opposed to a

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.590 
semi-transparent plastic as opposed to a
solid<00:00:43.260> color<00:00:43.530> like<00:00:43.800> this<00:00:44.040> but<00:00:44.910> as<00:00:45.059> it<00:00:45.239> is<00:00:45.270> the

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
solid color like this but as it is the

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.790 
solid color like this but as it is the
red<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.930> black<00:00:46.079> looked<00:00:46.379> really<00:00:46.649> nice

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800

not really a deluxe and it's more on the
size<00:01:52.619> or<00:01:52.979> scale<00:01:53.220> with<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:54.090> Human<00:01:54.600> Alliance<00:01:54.689> or

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
the alternator's vehicle forms and just

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.620 
the alternator's vehicle forms and just
has<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.540> size<00:02:00.780> comparison<00:02:00.960> I'll<00:02:01.740> bring<00:02:01.979> in

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
has a size comparison I'll bring in

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.149 
has a size comparison I'll bring in
deluxe<00:02:03.630> class<00:02:03.960> Merve<00:02:04.439> and<00:02:04.680> you<00:02:04.740> can<00:02:04.860> clearly

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
deluxe class Merve and you can clearly

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.859 
deluxe class Merve and you can clearly
see<00:02:05.360> the<00:02:06.360> size<00:02:07.170> or<00:02:07.500> scale<00:02:07.770> difference<00:02:08.190> there

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
see the size or scale difference there

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.170 
see the size or scale difference there
so<00:02:09.869> clearly<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.860> crossover<00:02:11.459> vehicle<00:02:11.849> here<00:02:12.030> is

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
so clearly the crossover vehicle here is

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.910 
so clearly the crossover vehicle here is
not<00:02:12.420> a<00:02:12.720> deluxe<00:02:13.230> figure

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
not a deluxe figure

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.270 
not a deluxe figure
it's<00:02:14.610> a<00:02:14.760> it's<00:02:14.970> a<00:02:15.060> really<00:02:15.500> nice-sized<00:02:16.500> vehicle

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
it's a it's a really nice-sized vehicle

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.250 
it's a it's a really nice-sized vehicle
um<00:02:18.200> so<00:02:19.200> with<00:02:19.830> that<00:02:19.950> said<00:02:20.250> let<00:02:20.550> me<00:02:20.640> show<00:02:20.670> you<00:02:20.880> the

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
um so with that said let me show you the

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.490 
um so with that said let me show you the
glow-in-the-dark<00:02:22.260> feature<00:02:24.020> and<00:02:25.020> you<00:02:25.230> can<00:02:25.350> see

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
glow-in-the-dark feature and you can see

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.260 
glow-in-the-dark feature and you can see
the<00:02:25.890> glow-in-the-dark<00:02:26.220> feature<00:02:26.730> does<00:02:26.970> work

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
the glow-in-the-dark feature does work

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:35.600 
the glow-in-the-dark feature does work
really<00:02:27.780> nice<00:02:32.960> so<00:02:33.960> as<00:02:34.200> usual<00:02:34.710> the<00:02:35.280> first<00:02:35.310> thing

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
really nice so as usual the first thing

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.400 
really nice so as usual the first thing
I'll<00:02:35.730> start<00:02:35.970> off<00:02:36.090> with<00:02:36.270> is<00:02:36.570> transforming<00:02:37.380> the

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
I'll start off with is transforming the

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.830 
I'll start off with is transforming the
legs<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:38.610> legs<00:02:38.760> are<00:02:39.060> basically<00:02:39.360> formed<00:02:39.720> out

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
legs the legs are basically formed out

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.340 
legs the legs are basically formed out
of<00:02:40.020> the<00:02:40.200> rear<00:02:40.500> half<00:02:41.400> of<00:02:41.580> the<00:02:41.730> vehicle<00:02:42.230> so<00:02:43.230> what

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
of the rear half of the vehicle so what

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.840 
of the rear half of the vehicle so what
I<00:02:43.380> find<00:02:43.650> easier<00:02:43.980> to<00:02:44.100> do<00:02:44.190> is<00:02:44.370> just<00:02:44.520> split<00:02:44.700> the

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
I find easier to do is just split the

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
I find easier to do is just split the
legs<00:02:45.030> and<00:02:46.010> extend<00:02:47.010> them<00:02:47.280> out<00:02:47.600> and<00:02:48.600> you<00:02:48.690> want<00:02:48.810> to

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
legs and extend them out and you want to

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.270 
legs and extend them out and you want to
make<00:02:48.990> sure<00:02:49.020> they<00:02:49.290> kind<00:02:49.500> of<00:02:49.560> lock<00:02:49.800> in<00:02:49.950> place<00:02:50.160> you

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
make sure they kind of lock in place you

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.350 
make sure they kind of lock in place you
want<00:02:50.400> to<00:02:50.430> make<00:02:50.550> sure<00:02:50.580> you<00:02:50.730> just<00:02:50.880> use<00:02:51.060> a<00:02:51.090> lot<00:02:51.330> of

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
want to make sure you just use a lot of

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.780 
want to make sure you just use a lot of
force<00:02:51.720> and<00:02:51.930> extend<00:02:52.830> out<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.100> legs<00:02:53.310> as<00:02:53.490> far<00:02:53.700> as

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
force and extend out the legs as far as

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.699 
force and extend out the legs as far as
they'll<00:02:53.940> go<00:02:53.970> because<00:02:54.390> otherwise<00:02:54.600> they'll<00:02:55.590> be

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
they'll go because otherwise they'll be

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.620 
they'll go because otherwise they'll be
a<00:02:55.740> little<00:02:55.890> bit<00:02:56.070> loose<00:02:56.280> so<00:02:56.580> you<00:02:57.300> want<00:02:57.480> to<00:02:57.540> make

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
a little bit loose so you want to make

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.900 
a little bit loose so you want to make
sure<00:02:57.660> you<00:02:57.870> extend<00:02:58.320> out<00:02:58.440> the<00:02:58.470> legs<00:02:58.740> to<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.340> full

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
sure you extend out the legs to the full

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.810 
sure you extend out the legs to the full
extent<00:03:00.470> we'll<00:03:01.470> bring<00:03:01.590> down<00:03:01.650> the<00:03:02.100> little<00:03:02.610> toes

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
extent we'll bring down the little toes

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.810 
extent we'll bring down the little toes
here<00:03:03.120> and<00:03:04.080> just<00:03:05.010> double-check<00:03:05.400> on<00:03:05.550> the<00:03:05.640> legs

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
here and just double-check on the legs

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:06.860 
here and just double-check on the legs
to<00:03:06.060> make<00:03:06.090> sure<00:03:06.300> they're<00:03:06.420> all<00:03:06.540> the<00:03:06.660> way<00:03:06.750> out

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
to make sure they're all the way out

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.130 
to make sure they're all the way out
which<00:03:07.380> they<00:03:07.500> seem<00:03:07.680> to<00:03:07.800> be<00:03:07.940> and<00:03:08.940> moving<00:03:09.630> to<00:03:09.840> the

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
which they seem to be and moving to the

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.320 
which they seem to be and moving to the
front<00:03:10.530> of<00:03:10.860> the<00:03:11.100> vehicle<00:03:11.459> or<00:03:11.670> the<00:03:11.790> top<00:03:12.000> of<00:03:12.030> the

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
front of the vehicle or the top of the

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.210 
front of the vehicle or the top of the
robot<00:03:12.630> mode<00:03:12.780> going<00:03:13.530> to<00:03:13.620> take<00:03:13.709> the<00:03:13.830> two<00:03:13.980> sides

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
robot mode going to take the two sides

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.680 
robot mode going to take the two sides
of<00:03:14.370> the<00:03:14.459> vehicle<00:03:14.550> here<00:03:14.910> and<00:03:17.390> rotate<00:03:18.390> them<00:03:18.540> out

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
of the vehicle here and rotate them out

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.280 
of the vehicle here and rotate them out
like<00:03:18.810> that<00:03:19.160> you<00:03:20.160> want<00:03:20.310> to<00:03:20.370> take<00:03:20.519> the<00:03:21.290> section

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
like that you want to take the section

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.790 
like that you want to take the section
of<00:03:22.560> vehicle<00:03:22.920> here<00:03:23.239> and<00:03:25.970> rotate<00:03:26.970> up<00:03:27.180> like<00:03:27.390> that

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.800 
of vehicle here and rotate up like that

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.990 
of vehicle here and rotate up like that
now<00:03:28.800> what<00:03:29.010> you<00:03:29.070> want<00:03:29.190> to<00:03:29.250> do<00:03:29.370> is<00:03:29.519> rotate<00:03:29.730> the

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
now what you want to do is rotate the

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.890 
now what you want to do is rotate the
waist<00:03:30.120> around<00:03:30.540> 180<00:03:31.760> and<00:03:32.760> the<00:03:33.690> really<00:03:33.870> cool

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
waist around 180 and the really cool

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.690 
waist around 180 and the really cool
part<00:03:34.110> in<00:03:34.560> my<00:03:34.680> opinion<00:03:34.709> of<00:03:35.100> the<00:03:35.190> transformation

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
part in my opinion of the transformation

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.630 
part in my opinion of the transformation
is<00:03:35.820> the<00:03:35.850> head<00:03:36.239> reveal<00:03:36.510> I<00:03:36.750> can<00:03:37.530> see<00:03:37.680> the<00:03:37.830> section

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
is the head reveal I can see the section

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.320 
is the head reveal I can see the section
bit<00:03:38.760> here<00:03:39.060> will<00:03:39.570> be<00:03:39.780> on<00:03:40.140> tab<00:03:40.620> and<00:03:41.120> fold<00:03:42.120> down

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
bit here will be on tab and fold down

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.490 
bit here will be on tab and fold down
and<00:03:43.310> reveal<00:03:44.310> the<00:03:44.670> head<00:03:45.269> now<00:03:46.050> what's<00:03:46.260> cool<00:03:46.440> is

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
and reveal the head now what's cool is

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:47.900 
and reveal the head now what's cool is
do<00:03:46.769> you<00:03:46.860> notice<00:03:47.010> there's<00:03:47.310> actually<00:03:47.670> a<00:03:47.700> big

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
do you notice there's actually a big

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.770 
do you notice there's actually a big
cavity<00:03:48.180> here<00:03:48.570> this<00:03:49.350> whole<00:03:49.560> section<00:03:50.570> fills<00:03:51.570> in

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
cavity here this whole section fills in

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.509 
cavity here this whole section fills in
that<00:03:51.930> cavity<00:03:52.200> really<00:03:52.620> nicely<00:03:52.800> to<00:03:53.250> come<00:03:53.430> from

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
that cavity really nicely to come from

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:57.410 
that cavity really nicely to come from
the<00:03:53.640> chest<00:03:53.880> so<00:03:54.810> that<00:03:54.840> is<00:03:55.140> cool<00:03:56.330> finally<00:03:57.330> you

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
the chest so that is cool finally you

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.699 
the chest so that is cool finally you
might<00:03:57.510> extend<00:03:57.900> out<00:03:58.050> the<00:03:58.080> arms<00:03:59.540> and<00:04:00.540> bring<00:04:01.530> out

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
might extend out the arms and bring out

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:09.890 
might extend out the arms and bring out
the<00:04:02.130> hands<00:04:07.610> there<00:04:08.610> it<00:04:08.760> is

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
the hands there it is

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.059 
the hands there it is
war<00:04:10.769> machine<00:04:10.920> in<00:04:11.569> robot<00:04:12.569> mode<00:04:12.810> and<00:04:13.110> you<00:04:13.950> can

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
war machine in robot mode and you can

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:15.559 
war machine in robot mode and you can
bring<00:04:14.250> down<00:04:14.519> the<00:04:14.819> little<00:04:14.939> weapons<00:04:15.299> here<00:04:15.480> on

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
bring down the little weapons here on

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:18.050 
bring down the little weapons here on
the<00:04:15.659> shoulder<00:04:15.959> which<00:04:16.229> is<00:04:16.259> critical<00:04:17.060> rotate

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
the shoulder which is critical rotate

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:27.249 
the shoulder which is critical rotate
these<00:04:18.209> down<00:04:21.979> and<00:04:22.979> just<00:04:23.460> a<00:04:23.610> quick<00:04:23.880> 360<00:04:24.300> for<00:04:24.960> you

00:04:27.249 --> 00:04:27.259 

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:29.990 

and<00:04:28.259> I<00:04:28.350> have<00:04:28.470> to<00:04:28.590> say<00:04:28.740> it's<00:04:28.919> one<00:04:29.130> of<00:04:29.160> the<00:04:29.340> better

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
and I have to say it's one of the better

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.560 
and I have to say it's one of the better
transformers<00:04:30.990> crossover<00:04:31.500> as<00:04:31.590> figures

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
transformers crossover as figures

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.210 
transformers crossover as figures
especially<00:04:33.570> if<00:04:33.690> you<00:04:33.810> look<00:04:34.050> at<00:04:34.289> the<00:04:34.590> Star<00:04:35.190> Wars

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
especially if you look at the Star Wars

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.060 
especially if you look at the Star Wars
crossover<00:04:36.000> figures<00:04:36.300> most<00:04:37.259> of<00:04:37.530> the<00:04:37.590> time<00:04:37.800> they

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
crossover figures most of the time they

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:39.370 
crossover figures most of the time they
don't<00:04:38.190> turn<00:04:38.370> out<00:04:38.430> as<00:04:38.699> well<00:04:38.820> as<00:04:39.000> this

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
don't turn out as well as this

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.659 
don't turn out as well as this
particular<00:04:40.380> crossover<00:04:40.800> turned<00:04:41.130> out<00:04:41.280> so<00:04:41.520> I'm

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:41.669 
particular crossover turned out so I'm

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:44.600 
particular crossover turned out so I'm
really<00:04:41.699> happy<00:04:42.000> with<00:04:42.270> that<00:04:43.039> and<00:04:44.039> in<00:04:44.250> terms<00:04:44.490> of

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
really happy with that and in terms of

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.180 
really happy with that and in terms of
articulation<00:04:45.300> well<00:04:45.449> the<00:04:46.380> head<00:04:46.590> apparently<00:04:46.830> is

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
articulation well the head apparently is

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.390 
articulation well the head apparently is
just<00:04:47.220> on<00:04:47.699> a<00:04:47.729> swivel<00:04:48.150> joint<00:04:49.130> you<00:04:50.130> can<00:04:50.250> have

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
just on a swivel joint you can have

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.400 
just on a swivel joint you can have
articulation<00:04:50.940> here<00:04:51.330> at<00:04:51.510> the<00:04:51.600> shoulders<00:04:54.410> and

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
articulation here at the shoulders and

you<00:04:55.650> do<00:04:55.770> have<00:04:55.949> articulation<00:04:56.639> at<00:04:56.789> the<00:04:56.880> elbows

00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919 
you do have articulation at the elbows

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:00.040 
you do have articulation at the elbows
of<00:04:58.919> course<00:04:59.130> you<00:04:59.250> have<00:04:59.340> waist<00:04:59.580> articulation

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
of course you have waist articulation

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:05.920 
of course you have waist articulation
and<00:05:01.050> hip<00:05:01.979> articulation<00:05:02.449> forward<00:05:03.449> back<00:05:04.289> and

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
and hip articulation forward back and

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.379 
and hip articulation forward back and
out<00:05:06.930> to<00:05:07.169> the<00:05:07.199> side<00:05:07.470> a<00:05:07.880> swivel<00:05:08.880> above<00:05:09.120> the<00:05:09.210> knee

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:09.389 
out to the side a swivel above the knee

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:12.529 
out to the side a swivel above the knee
up<00:05:10.050> and<00:05:10.289> upon<00:05:10.560> me<00:05:10.680> and<00:05:11.009> that<00:05:11.820> is<00:05:12.060> all<00:05:12.180> you<00:05:12.240> have

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:12.539 
up and upon me and that is all you have

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:14.510 
up and upon me and that is all you have
for<00:05:12.810> transformation<00:05:13.470> and<00:05:13.680> speaking<00:05:14.340> of<00:05:14.430> the

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
for transformation and speaking of the

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.250 
for transformation and speaking of the
leg<00:05:14.699> how<00:05:14.880> how<00:05:15.449> I<00:05:15.479> told<00:05:15.599> you<00:05:15.810> that<00:05:15.960> you<00:05:16.080> need<00:05:16.169> to

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.260 
leg how how I told you that you need to

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:17.600 
leg how how I told you that you need to
make<00:05:16.410> sure<00:05:16.440> you<00:05:16.710> extend<00:05:17.220> it<00:05:17.280> all<00:05:17.430> the<00:05:17.460> way<00:05:17.580> out

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
make sure you extend it all the way out

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.570 
make sure you extend it all the way out
you<00:05:18.419> can<00:05:18.479> see<00:05:18.720> it's<00:05:18.840> count<00:05:18.990> loose<00:05:19.169> now<00:05:19.410> I<00:05:19.590> think

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
you can see it's count loose now I think

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.040 
you can see it's count loose now I think
it's<00:05:20.940> because<00:05:21.210> it<00:05:21.330> came<00:05:21.419> out<00:05:21.599> of<00:05:21.690> that<00:05:21.780> groove

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
it's because it came out of that groove

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:23.180 
it's because it came out of that groove
you<00:05:22.199> wanna<00:05:22.320> make<00:05:22.440> sure<00:05:22.590> you<00:05:22.710> just<00:05:22.889> make<00:05:23.039> sure

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
you wanna make sure you just make sure

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.240 
you wanna make sure you just make sure
you<00:05:23.310> all<00:05:23.490> the<00:05:23.699> way<00:05:24.770> extend<00:05:25.770> it<00:05:25.830> out<00:05:25.919> like<00:05:26.099> that

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
you all the way extend it out like that

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.810 
you all the way extend it out like that
so<00:05:26.490> it<00:05:27.210> kind<00:05:27.300> of<00:05:27.389> locks<00:05:27.510> in<00:05:27.720> place<00:05:28.490> and<00:05:29.490> that's

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
so it kind of locks in place and that's

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.550 
so it kind of locks in place and that's
how<00:05:29.940> you<00:05:30.000> know<00:05:30.150> you<00:05:30.300> know<00:05:30.360> you<00:05:30.720> transform<00:05:31.440> the

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 
how you know you know you transform the

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:37.300 
how you know you know you transform the
legs<00:05:31.740> correctly<00:05:33.440> so<00:05:34.699> I'll<00:05:35.699> bring<00:05:35.940> in

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.310 
legs correctly so I'll bring in

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:41.320 
legs correctly so I'll bring in
crossovers<00:05:39.380> spider-man<00:05:40.380> here<00:05:40.590> just<00:05:40.860> as<00:05:41.010> a

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:14.940 
size comparison with that one and of

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:16.850 
size comparison with that one and of
course<00:06:14.970> the<00:06:15.270> glow-in-the-dark<00:06:15.900> features<00:06:16.620> do

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:16.860 
course the glow-in-the-dark features do

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:19.370 
course the glow-in-the-dark features do
work<00:06:17.070> in<00:06:17.340> the<00:06:17.610> robot<00:06:18.000> mode<00:06:18.029> as<00:06:18.389> well<00:06:18.539> you<00:06:19.260> can

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:19.380 
work in the robot mode as well you can

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:21.080 
work in the robot mode as well you can
see<00:06:19.560> in<00:06:19.680> addition<00:06:19.979> to<00:06:20.070> the<00:06:20.190> arc<00:06:20.520> reactor<00:06:20.700> you

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.090 
see in addition to the arc reactor you

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:23.270 
see in addition to the arc reactor you
do<00:06:21.180> have<00:06:21.360> the<00:06:21.630> glowing<00:06:21.990> eyes<00:06:22.260> and<00:06:22.919> a

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:23.280 
do have the glowing eyes and a

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.500 
do have the glowing eyes and a
first<00:06:23.400> the<00:06:23.580> headlights<00:06:23.940> now<00:06:24.180> on<00:06:24.420> the

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:24.510 
first the headlights now on the

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:27.470 
first the headlights now on the
shoulders<00:06:24.870> also<00:06:25.740> still<00:06:26.180> glow-in-the-dark

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:27.480 
shoulders also still glow-in-the-dark

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:35.360 
shoulders also still glow-in-the-dark
which<00:06:27.660> is<00:06:27.810> really<00:06:28.050> cool<00:06:33.560> so<00:06:34.560> oh<00:06:34.860> no<00:06:35.130> I<00:06:35.160> think

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:35.370 
which is really cool so oh no I think

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:36.950 
which is really cool so oh no I think
it's<00:06:35.580> a<00:06:35.639> really<00:06:35.760> great<00:06:35.940> figure<00:06:36.300> obviously<00:06:36.810> it

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960 
it's a really great figure obviously it

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.650 
it's a really great figure obviously it
was<00:06:37.110> a<00:06:37.139> very<00:06:37.260> simple<00:06:37.830> transformation<00:06:38.660> and

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:39.660 
was a very simple transformation and

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.950 
was a very simple transformation and
most<00:06:40.350> importantly<00:06:40.860> in<00:06:41.510> robot<00:06:42.510> mode<00:06:42.540> it<00:06:42.900> looks

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.960 
most importantly in robot mode it looks

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.560 
most importantly in robot mode it looks
actually<00:06:43.410> very<00:06:43.740> decent<00:06:44.610> actually<00:06:45.389> better

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:45.570 
actually very decent actually better

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:48.050 
actually very decent actually better
than<00:06:45.750> G<00:06:45.900> since<00:06:46.220> again<00:06:47.220> like<00:06:47.400> I<00:06:47.490> said<00:06:47.550> if<00:06:47.940> you

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:48.060 
than G since again like I said if you

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:51.379 
than G since again like I said if you
look<00:06:48.270> at<00:06:48.450> some<00:06:48.630> of<00:06:48.750> the<00:06:48.840> Star<00:06:49.290> Wars<00:06:50.389> crossovers

00:06:51.379 --> 00:06:51.389 
look at some of the Star Wars crossovers

00:06:51.389 --> 00:06:55.370 
look at some of the Star Wars crossovers
and<00:06:52.370> in<00:06:53.370> the<00:06:54.180> robot<00:06:54.540> or<00:06:54.720> mech<00:06:54.930> form<00:06:55.230> they

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:55.380 
and in the robot or mech form they

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:58.220 
and in the robot or mech form they
really<00:06:55.800> don't<00:06:56.360> look<00:06:57.360> that<00:06:57.510> great<00:06:57.720> most<00:06:58.080> of<00:06:58.169> the

00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:58.230 
really don't look that great most of the

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:00.830 
really don't look that great most of the
time<00:06:58.440> so<00:06:59.340> this<00:06:59.669> actually<00:07:00.060> is<00:07:00.180> a<00:07:00.210> believable

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:00.840 
time so this actually is a believable

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:04.640 
time so this actually is a believable
war<00:07:01.440> machine<00:07:01.770> and<00:07:02.270> if<00:07:03.270> I<00:07:03.360> see<00:07:03.660> the<00:07:04.080> other

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:04.650 
war machine and if I see the other

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:06.980 
war machine and if I see the other
version<00:07:05.100> of<00:07:05.160> this<00:07:05.310> with<00:07:05.700> the<00:07:05.910> Ironman<00:07:06.600> colors

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:06.990 
version of this with the Ironman colors

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:09.890 
version of this with the Ironman colors
I<00:07:07.230> will<00:07:07.860> pick<00:07:08.190> it<00:07:08.220> up<00:07:08.400> if<00:07:08.760> I<00:07:08.940> can<00:07:09.060> find<00:07:09.240> it<00:07:09.390> for<00:07:09.450> a

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:09.900 
I will pick it up if I can find it for a

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:13.360 
I will pick it up if I can find it for a
decent<00:07:10.140> price<00:07:11.150> so<00:07:12.150> there<00:07:12.300> you<00:07:12.360> go<00:07:12.570> I<00:07:12.780> look<00:07:12.990> at

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:13.370 
decent price so there you go I look at

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:18.200 
decent price so there you go I look at
transformers<00:07:14.370> crossovers<00:07:14.940> war<00:07:15.840> machine
