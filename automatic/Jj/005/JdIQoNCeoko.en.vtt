where to start well i guess i'm going to

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.619 
where to start well i guess i'm going to
start<00:00:38.820> with<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.090> outside<00:00:39.660> first<00:00:39.930> of<00:00:40.260> course

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:41.629 
start with the outside first of course

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:45.020 
start with the outside first of course
first<00:00:42.629> off<00:00:42.809> I<00:00:42.930> want<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.140> say<00:00:43.200> I<00:00:43.680> think<00:00:44.219> this<00:00:44.879> is

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
first off I want to say I think this is

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.630 
first off I want to say I think this is
my<00:00:45.500> well<00:00:46.500> I<00:00:46.530> know<00:00:46.770> I<00:00:46.890> don't<00:00:47.219> want<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.399> say<00:00:47.520> it's

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
my well I know I don't want to say it's

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.479 
my well I know I don't want to say it's
my<00:00:47.730> bass<00:00:48.000> bass<00:00:48.379> from<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.530> outside<00:00:50.010> but<00:00:50.280> from

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
my bass bass from the outside but from

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.400 
my bass bass from the outside but from
the<00:00:50.579> inside<00:00:50.640> it<00:00:51.120> definitely<00:00:51.600> is<00:00:51.809> my<00:00:51.989> best<00:00:52.199> bass

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
the inside it definitely is my best bass

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.479 
the inside it definitely is my best bass
and<00:00:53.420> if<00:00:54.420> you<00:00:54.570> look<00:00:55.469> at<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:55.620> as<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:55.949> whole<00:00:56.190> thing<00:00:56.460> I

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
and if you look at it as a whole thing I

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.490 
and if you look at it as a whole thing I
think<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.000> is<00:00:57.030> my<00:00:57.239> best<00:00:57.480> page<00:00:57.660> because<00:00:58.050> from

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
think it is my best page because from

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.910 
think it is my best page because from
outside<00:00:59.010> my<00:00:59.190> clone<00:00:59.489> based<00:00:59.670> on<00:00:59.820> Naboo<00:01:00.770> tupa<00:01:01.770> no

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
outside my clone based on Naboo tupa no

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.670 
outside my clone based on Naboo tupa no
I<00:01:02.129> think<00:01:02.250> that<00:01:02.579> was<00:01:02.730> my<00:01:02.910> best<00:01:03.090> base<00:01:03.650> from<00:01:04.650> the

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
I think that was my best base from the

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.469 
I think that was my best base from the
outside<00:01:05.129> but<00:01:05.369> I<00:01:05.519> didn't<00:01:05.820> build<00:01:06.030> an<00:01:06.150> insight

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
outside but I didn't build an insight

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.109 
outside but I didn't build an insight
for<00:01:06.720> that<00:01:06.869> so<00:01:07.860> I<00:01:07.890> guess<00:01:08.189> that<00:01:08.670> doesn't<00:01:08.700> really

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
for that so I guess that doesn't really

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.950 
for that so I guess that doesn't really
count<00:01:09.210> because<00:01:09.479> it<00:01:09.810> wasn't<00:01:10.170> finished<00:01:10.409> so

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
count because it wasn't finished so

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.420 
count because it wasn't finished so
that's<00:01:12.960> why<00:01:13.170> I<00:01:13.200> think<00:01:13.229> this<00:01:13.560> is<00:01:13.680> my<00:01:13.950> best<00:01:14.189> bass

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
that's why I think this is my best bass

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.270 
that's why I think this is my best bass
overall<00:01:15.030> but<00:01:15.630> yeah<00:01:16.320> nonetheless<00:01:16.680> i'm<00:01:17.070> going

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
overall but yeah nonetheless i'm going

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.420 
overall but yeah nonetheless i'm going

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
drawers on it and I got a question of

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.510 
drawers on it and I got a question of
liquor<00:02:13.630> which<00:02:14.630> was<00:02:14.890> where<00:02:15.890> are<00:02:16.130> these<00:02:16.280> clowns

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
liquor which was where are these clowns

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.450 
liquor which was where are these clowns
clowns<00:02:17.270> droids<00:02:17.780> going<00:02:18.050> to<00:02:18.190> whenever<00:02:19.190> I<00:02:19.280> get<00:02:19.430> a

clowns droids going to whenever I get a

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.910 
clowns droids going to whenever I get a
question<00:02:19.880> I<00:02:19.970> get<00:02:20.210> I<00:02:20.510> think<00:02:20.960> just<00:02:21.680> use<00:02:21.890> your

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
question I get I think just use your

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.910 
question I get I think just use your
imagination<00:02:22.330> your<00:02:23.330> fantasy<00:02:23.900> plus<00:02:24.770> around

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
imagination your fantasy plus around

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.700 
imagination your fantasy plus around
like<00:02:25.340> two<00:02:25.760> or<00:02:25.940> three<00:02:25.970> options<00:02:26.570> one<00:02:27.290> of<00:02:27.410> them<00:02:27.560> is

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:27.710 
like two or three options one of them is

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.830 
like two or three options one of them is
they<00:02:27.980> could<00:02:28.340> go<00:02:28.640> attack<00:02:29.120> clones<00:02:29.510> that<00:02:29.690> are

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
they could go attack clones that are

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.320 
they could go attack clones that are
hidden<00:02:30.020> in<00:02:30.320> the<00:02:30.350> forests<00:02:30.950> or<00:02:31.100> another<00:02:32.060> thing

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
hidden in the forests or another thing

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.060 
hidden in the forests or another thing
is<00:02:32.510> they<00:02:32.690> could<00:02:32.810> just<00:02:33.020> attack<00:02:33.560> the<00:02:33.590> side<00:02:33.920> of

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
is they could just attack the side of

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.400 
is they could just attack the side of
the<00:02:34.160> base<00:02:34.340> there's<00:02:34.760> glass<00:02:35.090> right<00:02:35.360> there<00:02:35.600> so

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
the base there's glass right there so

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.550 
the base there's glass right there so
you<00:02:36.500> know<00:02:36.830> just<00:02:37.220> use<00:02:37.430> your<00:02:37.610> imagination<00:02:37.640> and

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
you know just use your imagination and

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.530 
you know just use your imagination and
that's<00:02:39.560> also<00:02:39.770> another<00:02:40.070> thing<00:02:40.300> with<00:02:41.300> the

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
that's also another thing with the

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.750 
that's also another thing with the
separatists<00:02:42.410> shuttle<00:02:42.980> on<00:02:43.160> the<00:02:43.280> top<00:02:43.460> of<00:02:43.610> its

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
separatists shuttle on the top of its

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.090 
separatists shuttle on the top of its
i'm<00:02:44.180> sure<00:02:44.540> i<00:02:44.570> will<00:02:44.780> get<00:02:45.140> questions<00:02:45.620> about<00:02:45.740> that

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
i'm sure i will get questions about that

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.980 
i'm sure i will get questions about that
and<00:02:46.340> i'm<00:02:46.430> sure<00:02:46.730> i<00:02:46.760> already<00:02:47.210> had<00:02:47.360> questions<00:02:47.840> or

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
and i'm sure i already had questions or

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:49.780 
and i'm sure i already had questions or
my<00:02:48.110> slideshow<00:02:48.860> of<00:02:48.890> that<00:02:49.160> which<00:02:49.370> i<00:02:49.520> didn't

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
my slideshow of that which i didn't

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.790 
my slideshow of that which i didn't
answer<00:02:50.180> just<00:02:51.050> because<00:02:51.320> i<00:02:51.350> don't<00:02:51.590> want<00:02:51.620> to

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
answer just because i don't want to

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.040 
answer just because i don't want to
answer<00:02:51.950> stupid<00:02:52.340> questions<00:02:52.810> because<00:02:53.810> you

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
answer stupid questions because you

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.140 
answer stupid questions because you
should<00:02:54.320> rain<00:02:54.530> use<00:02:54.770> your<00:02:54.920> imagination<00:02:55.580> that

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
should rain use your imagination that

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.690 
should rain use your imagination that
will<00:02:56.270> go<00:02:56.420> into<00:02:56.570> that<00:02:56.810> later<00:02:57.550> but<00:02:58.550> the

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
will go into that later but the

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.480 
will go into that later but the
battlefield<00:02:59.180> it's<00:02:59.390> not<00:02:59.750> that<00:03:00.200> great<00:03:01.190> actually

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.490 
battlefield it's not that great actually

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.910 
battlefield it's not that great actually
it's<00:03:01.790> a<00:03:01.880> bit<00:03:02.060> simple<00:03:02.570> one<00:03:03.410> thing<00:03:03.680> that<00:03:03.890> is

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
it's a bit simple one thing that is

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.890 
it's a bit simple one thing that is
really<00:03:04.280> cool<00:03:04.400> is<00:03:04.670> this<00:03:04.790> like<00:03:05.090> little<00:03:05.420> path

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
really cool is this like little path

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.710 
really cool is this like little path
leading<00:03:06.260> to<00:03:06.380> base<00:03:07.060> with<00:03:08.060> all<00:03:08.270> kinds<00:03:08.660> of

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
leading to base with all kinds of

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.910 
leading to base with all kinds of
different<00:03:08.870> colors<00:03:10.090> it's<00:03:11.090> okay<00:03:11.990> that's<00:03:12.710> a

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
different colors it's okay that's a

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.260 
different colors it's okay that's a
little<00:03:13.190> bit<00:03:13.310> but<00:03:13.490> you<00:03:13.610> can<00:03:13.760> really<00:03:13.880> see<00:03:14.180> it

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 
little bit but you can really see it

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:15.880 
little bit but you can really see it
from<00:03:14.300> here<00:03:14.660> because<00:03:14.990> the<00:03:15.200> clones<00:03:15.440> are<00:03:15.650> white

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
from here because the clones are white

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.750 
from here because the clones are white
the<00:03:16.250> droids<00:03:16.550> orange<00:03:17.420> to<00:03:17.720> grass<00:03:17.930> is<00:03:18.080> green<00:03:18.320> so

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
the droids orange to grass is green so

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.740 
the droids orange to grass is green so
doesn't<00:03:19.760> really<00:03:19.940> stand<00:03:20.240> out<00:03:20.420> that<00:03:20.480> much

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
doesn't really stand out that much

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.660 
doesn't really stand out that much
against<00:03:21.290> you<00:03:21.410> could<00:03:21.560> say<00:03:21.740> and<00:03:21.980> it's<00:03:22.340> just<00:03:22.580> the

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
against you could say and it's just the

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.650 
against you could say and it's just the
angle<00:03:23.350> anyway<00:03:24.350> so<00:03:24.410> we<00:03:24.740> have<00:03:24.920> the<00:03:25.550> main<00:03:26.090> fibroid

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
angle anyway so we have the main fibroid

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.380 
angle anyway so we have the main fibroid
year<00:03:26.900> i<00:03:27.220> didn't<00:03:28.220> put<00:03:28.250> in<00:03:28.400> too<00:03:28.730> much<00:03:28.760> figures

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
year i didn't put in too much figures

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.900 
year i didn't put in too much figures
because<00:03:29.660> i<00:03:29.840> didn't<00:03:30.230> feel<00:03:30.410> like<00:03:30.500> doing<00:03:30.910> putting

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
because i didn't feel like doing putting

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.960 
because i didn't feel like doing putting
too<00:03:32.090> much<00:03:32.210> figures<00:03:32.540> in<00:03:32.660> it<00:03:32.920> but<00:03:33.920> yeah<00:03:34.700> we<00:03:34.880> have

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
too much figures in it but yeah we have

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.690 
too much figures in it but yeah we have
clones<00:03:35.480> dying<00:03:35.960> right<00:03:36.230> here<00:03:36.560> and<00:03:37.520> that's

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
clones dying right here and that's

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.190 
clones dying right here and that's
another<00:03:37.820> thing<00:03:38.060> i<00:03:38.330> really<00:03:38.480> think<00:03:38.780> it's<00:03:38.930> stupid

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
another thing i really think it's stupid

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.350 
another thing i really think it's stupid
because<00:03:39.650> a<00:03:39.860> lot<00:03:40.130> of<00:03:40.160> guys<00:03:40.490> building<00:03:41.090> clone

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
because a lot of guys building clone

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.860 
because a lot of guys building clone
basis<00:03:41.810> or<00:03:42.050> just<00:03:42.110> mucks<00:03:42.680> they<00:03:43.640> did<00:03:43.970> do<00:03:44.360> like<00:03:44.570> all

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
basis or just mucks they did do like all

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.860 
basis or just mucks they did do like all
the<00:03:45.410> droids<00:03:46.280> lines<00:03:46.730> of<00:03:46.940> droids<00:03:47.180> are<00:03:47.390> dead<00:03:47.600> but

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
the droids lines of droids are dead but

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.480 
the droids lines of droids are dead but
there's<00:03:48.050> only<00:03:48.230> like<00:03:48.380> one<00:03:48.530> clone<00:03:49.010> down<00:03:49.280> or

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:49.490 
there's only like one clone down or

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:51.460 
there's only like one clone down or
something<00:03:49.700> I<00:03:49.970> mean<00:03:50.120> be<00:03:50.450> a<00:03:50.480> realistic<00:03:50.840> clones

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
something I mean be a realistic clones

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.220 
something I mean be a realistic clones
die<00:03:51.709> too<00:03:51.770> so<00:03:52.310> you<00:03:53.240> know<00:03:53.360> just<00:03:53.600> put<00:03:53.810> some<00:03:54.020> desk

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
die too so you know just put some desk

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.140 
die too so you know just put some desk

loans in it if you're making base that's

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.020 
loans in it if you're making base that's
one<00:03:56.450> tip<00:03:56.660> I<00:03:56.810> can<00:03:56.840> give<00:03:56.990> you<00:03:57.320> with<00:03:58.040> them<00:03:58.370> yeah<00:03:58.730> I

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.070 
actually now think about it I might

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.490 
actually now think about it I might
actually<00:04:01.310> do<00:04:01.640> is<00:04:01.910> some<00:04:02.360> kind<00:04:02.600> of<00:04:02.720> tip<00:04:03.050> of<00:04:03.440> a

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
actually do is some kind of tip of a

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.240 
actually do is some kind of tip of a
base<00:04:04.070> building<00:04:04.370> some<00:04:04.760> days<00:04:05.000> or<00:04:05.600> something

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
base building some days or something

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.370 
base building some days or something
because<00:04:07.250> i<00:04:07.670> think<00:04:07.820> i<00:04:08.360> am<00:04:08.630> one<00:04:08.870> of<00:04:08.900> the<00:04:09.140> bigger

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
because i think i am one of the bigger

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.130 
because i think i am one of the bigger
youtube<00:04:10.190> base<00:04:10.910> builders<00:04:11.360> are<00:04:11.510> there<00:04:11.720> i've<00:04:11.900> put

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.140 
youtube base builders are there i've put

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.070 
youtube base builders are there i've put
out<00:04:12.290> quite<00:04:13.010> a<00:04:13.040> lot<00:04:13.190> of<00:04:13.400> basis<00:04:13.880> and<00:04:14.150> actually

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.080 
out quite a lot of basis and actually

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.890 
out quite a lot of basis and actually
the<00:04:15.200> last<00:04:15.410> couple<00:04:15.650> of<00:04:15.830> the<00:04:16.700> Lexi<00:04:17.090> last<00:04:17.600> year

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
the last couple of the Lexi last year

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.469 
the last couple of the Lexi last year
while<00:04:18.440> net<00:04:18.859> last<00:04:19.130> six<00:04:19.609> months<00:04:19.790> I<00:04:20.030> think<00:04:20.090> I<00:04:20.330> only

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:20.479 
while net last six months I think I only

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:21.319 
while net last six months I think I only
made<00:04:20.900> like

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
made like

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.559 
made like
three<00:04:21.569> or<00:04:21.780> maybe<00:04:22.259> four<00:04:22.409> bases<00:04:23.099> but<00:04:24.090> before

00:04:24.559 --> 00:04:24.569 
three or maybe four bases but before

00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:26.510 
three or maybe four bases but before
that<00:04:24.750> I<00:04:24.810> used<00:04:25.139> to<00:04:25.259> build<00:04:25.439> lots<00:04:25.800> and<00:04:26.099> lots<00:04:26.310> and

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
that I used to build lots and lots and

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.050 
that I used to build lots and lots and
lots<00:04:26.699> more<00:04:27.240> loads<00:04:27.960> of<00:04:28.199> cases<00:04:28.669> lots<00:04:29.669> of<00:04:29.849> loads

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
lots more loads of cases lots of loads

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.969 
lots more loads of cases lots of loads
right<00:04:30.300> now<00:04:30.360> and<00:04:31.849> but<00:04:32.849> yeah<00:04:33.569> and<00:04:34.530> if<00:04:34.740> you<00:04:34.830> go

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:34.979 
right now and but yeah and if you go

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:40.159 
right now and but yeah and if you go
into<00:04:35.159> here<00:04:35.610> we<00:04:35.849> have<00:04:36.210> a<00:04:36.509> a<00:04:37.259> 80<00:04:39.139> which<00:04:40.139> is

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:40.169 
into here we have a a 80 which is

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:42.589 
into here we have a a 80 which is
getting<00:04:40.650> shot<00:04:40.889> at<00:04:41.039> because<00:04:41.460> I<00:04:41.819> just<00:04:42.030> felt<00:04:42.419> like

00:04:42.589 --> 00:04:42.599 
getting shot at because I just felt like

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:45.709 
getting shot at because I just felt like
I<00:04:43.020> needed<00:04:43.199> to<00:04:43.590> make<00:04:44.280> this<00:04:44.520> destroy<00:04:45.240> it<00:04:45.270> because

00:04:45.709 --> 00:04:45.719 
I needed to make this destroy it because

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:48.469 
I needed to make this destroy it because
otherwise<00:04:46.199> it<00:04:46.530> would<00:04:46.650> just<00:04:46.849> blow<00:04:47.849> a<00:04:47.879> blowout

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 
otherwise it would just blow a blowout

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:50.719 
otherwise it would just blow a blowout
all<00:04:48.840> in<00:04:48.930> the<00:04:49.050> base<00:04:49.199> and<00:04:49.439> it<00:04:49.530> will<00:04:49.710> be<00:04:49.889> destroyed

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:50.729 
all in the base and it will be destroyed

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:54.110 
all in the base and it will be destroyed
so<00:04:51.229> why<00:04:52.229> not<00:04:52.409> make<00:04:52.680> the<00:04:53.340> clones<00:04:53.580> destroy<00:04:54.000> the

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
so why not make the clones destroy the

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.450 
so why not make the clones destroy the
ad<00:04:54.569> so<00:04:54.810> it's<00:04:54.960> a<00:04:55.050> bit<00:04:55.199> of<00:04:55.319> a<00:04:55.409> fair<00:04:55.680> fight<00:04:55.949> because

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
ad so it's a bit of a fair fight because

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.550 
ad so it's a bit of a fair fight because
obviously<00:04:56.849> the<00:04:57.300> clothes<00:04:57.479> are<00:04:57.629> outnumbered

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.070 

and<00:05:01.560> here<00:05:01.800> it's<00:05:01.919> just<00:05:02.039> little<00:05:02.400> hill<00:05:02.870> because<00:05:03.870> I

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
and here it's just little hill because I

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.939 
and here it's just little hill because I
felt<00:05:04.349> like<00:05:04.560> making<00:05:04.830> a<00:05:05.099> hill<00:05:05.310> and<00:05:06.680> it's<00:05:07.680> just

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:07.949 
felt like making a hill and it's just

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:10.700 
felt like making a hill and it's just
all<00:05:08.129> random<00:05:08.699> plants<00:05:09.120> I<00:05:09.750> actually<00:05:10.409> have<00:05:10.680> no

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
all random plants I actually have no

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.540 
all random plants I actually have no
idea<00:05:11.099> what<00:05:11.280> all<00:05:11.520> around<00:05:11.819> looks<00:05:12.030> like<00:05:12.240> good<00:05:12.659> no

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
idea what all around looks like good no

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.950 
idea what all around looks like good no
someone<00:05:14.550> told<00:05:14.580> me<00:05:14.940> the<00:05:15.120> grass<00:05:15.270> plant<00:05:15.690> that<00:05:15.930> I

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
someone told me the grass plant that I

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.450 
someone told me the grass plant that I
think<00:05:16.259> it<00:05:16.379> is<00:05:16.409> because<00:05:16.680> I<00:05:16.979> already<00:05:17.129> built

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
think it is because I already built

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.140 
think it is because I already built
based<00:05:18.330> on<00:05:18.509> all<00:05:18.779> around<00:05:18.930> for<00:05:19.580> with<00:05:20.580> resonance

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
based on all around for with resonance

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:27.320 
based on all around for with resonance
so<00:05:21.800> um<00:05:22.879> yeah<00:05:23.879> so<00:05:24.860> here<00:05:25.860> we<00:05:26.009> have<00:05:26.039> the<00:05:27.000> fourth

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
so um yeah so here we have the fourth

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.379 
so um yeah so here we have the fourth
side<00:05:27.779> let<00:05:28.229> me<00:05:28.349> quickly<00:05:28.849> yeah<00:05:29.849> we<00:05:30.120> have<00:05:30.210> all

side let me quickly yeah we have all

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:32.300 
side let me quickly yeah we have all
kinds<00:05:30.539> of<00:05:30.719> random<00:05:30.960> trees<00:05:31.409> right<00:05:31.650> here<00:05:31.680> and<00:05:32.099> i

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
kinds of random trees right here and i

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.010 
kinds of random trees right here and i
really<00:05:32.580> like<00:05:32.729> these<00:05:32.909> trees<00:05:33.300> to<00:05:33.479> bigger<00:05:33.690> trees

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
really like these trees to bigger trees

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.980 
really like these trees to bigger trees
they<00:05:34.710> look<00:05:34.889> pretty<00:05:35.099> nice<00:05:35.370> with<00:05:35.849> some<00:05:36.150> because

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:36.990 
they look pretty nice with some because

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.829 
they look pretty nice with some because
of<00:05:37.110> the<00:05:37.229> plans<00:05:37.469> on<00:05:37.680> the<00:05:37.710> side<00:05:38.009> of<00:05:38.039> it<00:05:38.839> think

00:05:39.829 --> 00:05:39.839

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 
behind on the base first I will go on to

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:55.550 
behind on the base first I will go on to
the<00:05:48.990> baby<00:05:51.319> is<00:05:52.319> so<00:05:52.650> I<00:05:52.680> forgot<00:05:53.159> with<00:05:53.400> the<00:05:54.139> yeah<00:05:55.139> so
