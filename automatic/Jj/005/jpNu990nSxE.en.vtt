00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
just as easily but there's a lot

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.959 
just as easily but there's a lot
differences<00:00:42.840> first<00:00:43.770> of<00:00:43.950> all<00:00:44.070> once<00:00:44.610> you<00:00:44.760> get<00:00:44.940> to

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
differences first of all once you get to

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.910 
differences first of all once you get to
a<00:00:45.090> success<00:00:45.539> it<00:00:45.780> drops<00:00:45.989> off<00:00:46.200> very<00:00:46.350> quickly<00:00:46.530> as

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
a success it drops off very quickly as

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.560 
a success it drops off very quickly as
you<00:00:47.039> can<00:00:47.160> see<00:00:47.370> that<00:00:47.399> you<00:00:47.820> have<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.180> keep<00:00:48.360> going

you have to keep playing offensively and

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.700 
you have to keep playing offensively and
creatively<00:00:50.850> so<00:00:51.210> even<00:00:51.899> if<00:00:52.020> you<00:00:52.140> do<00:00:52.320> have<00:00:52.500> moves

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
to s SS very quickly so it's not just

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.880

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
that one combo it's the whole system but

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.580 
that one combo it's the whole system but
that<00:01:50.040> one<00:01:50.340> combo<00:01:50.790> does<00:01:51.329> underline<00:01:51.720> what<00:01:52.470> the

that one combo does underline what the
problem<00:01:52.890> with<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.159> game<00:01:53.340> is<00:01:53.549> that<00:01:53.790> is<00:01:53.909> very

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
problem with the game is that is very

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.200
