00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
nice traditional feel in the hands and

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.590 
nice traditional feel in the hands and
it<00:00:17.340> gives<00:00:17.520> you<00:00:17.609> a<00:00:17.670> good<00:00:17.850> lock<00:00:18.029> on<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.330> shaft

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
it gives you a good lock on the shaft

it gives you a good lock on the shaft
getting<00:00:19.470> into<00:00:19.650> construction<00:00:20.100> this<00:00:20.520> is<00:00:20.580> a<00:00:20.730> big

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
getting into construction this is a big

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.820 
getting into construction this is a big
upgrade<00:00:21.180> from<00:00:21.510> what<00:00:21.689> we<00:00:21.840> saw<00:00:22.050> in<00:00:22.170> that<00:00:22.230> 130

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
upgrade from what we saw in that 130

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.560 
upgrade from what we saw in that 130
because<00:00:23.490> you're<00:00:23.580> using<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.880> full<00:00:24.150> carbon<00:00:24.420> fiber

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
because you're using a full carbon fiber

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.480 
because you're using a full carbon fiber
weave<00:00:25.080> so<00:00:25.680> it's<00:00:25.830> gonna<00:00:25.920> be<00:00:26.070> much<00:00:26.220> more

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
weave so it's gonna be much more

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.070 
weave so it's gonna be much more
balanced<00:00:27.090> it's<00:00:27.630> gonna<00:00:27.720> be<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:27.900> lot<00:00:28.050> more

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
balanced it's gonna be a lot more

lightweight<00:00:28.500> most<00:00:29.340> importantly<00:00:29.760> it's<00:00:29.910> gonna

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
lightweight most importantly it's gonna

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.939

reinforced<00:01:30.420> freq<00:01:30.630> channels<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.229> this<00:01:32.009> was

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
reinforced freq channels and this was

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.190 
reinforced freq channels and this was
helped<00:01:32.430> develop<00:01:32.850> by<00:01:33.060> tailor-made<00:01:33.630> golf<00:01:33.930> and

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
helped develop by tailor-made golf and

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.289 
helped develop by tailor-made golf and
it<00:01:34.530> kind<00:01:34.829> of<00:01:34.890> acts<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.340> same<00:01:35.640> as<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:35.909> golf

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
it kind of acts the same as a golf

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.840 
it kind of acts the same as a golf
driver<00:01:36.659> so<00:01:36.990> has<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.500> phoneless<00:01:37.950> hollow<00:01:38.400> design

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
driver so has a phoneless hollow design

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.999 
driver so has a phoneless hollow design
that<00:01:39.360> transfers<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.869> ton<00:01:40.259> of<00:01:40.290> energy<00:01:40.530> back<00:01:40.979> into

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
that transfers a ton of energy back into

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.460 
that transfers a ton of energy back into
the<00:01:41.369> puck<00:01:41.670> off<00:01:41.850> of<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.270> blade<00:01:42.479> so<00:01:42.720> as<00:01:43.290> you're

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
the puck off of the blade so as you're

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.679 
the puck off of the blade so as you're
taking<00:01:43.680> snapshots<00:01:44.159> or<00:01:44.729> slap<00:01:45.030> shots<00:01:45.329> you're

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
taking snapshots or slap shots you're

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.749 
taking snapshots or slap shots you're
getting<00:01:45.960> an<00:01:46.020> insane<00:01:46.439> amount<00:01:46.619> of<00:01:46.829> pop<00:01:47.040> but<00:01:47.340> the

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
getting an insane amount of pop but the

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.130 
getting an insane amount of pop but the
other<00:01:47.909> great<00:01:48.149> thing<00:01:48.329> I<00:01:48.420> like<00:01:48.600> about<00:01:48.630> it<00:01:48.990> is

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
other great thing I like about it is

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.929 
other great thing I like about it is
that<00:01:49.350> with<00:01:49.740> that<00:01:49.770> phoneless<00:01:50.310> hollow<00:01:50.549> design

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
that with that phoneless hollow design

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.810 
that with that phoneless hollow design
it<00:01:51.450> is<00:01:51.630> very<00:01:51.960> lightweight<00:01:52.229> so<00:01:52.799> it<00:01:52.979> gives<00:01:53.700> you

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
it is very lightweight so it gives you

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.520 
it is very lightweight so it gives you
your<00:01:53.880> stick<00:01:54.210> an<00:01:54.390> overall<00:01:54.810> better<00:01:55.020> balance

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
from top to bottom and it has a great
