00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
the device is made of aluminum I think

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.090 
the device is made of aluminum I think
it<00:02:05.540> looks<00:02:05.750> really<00:02:05.990> nice<00:02:06.229> it's<00:02:06.500> only<00:02:06.740> fifteen

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
it looks really nice it's only fifteen

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.979 
it looks really nice it's only fifteen

is around 1.3 kilograms and on the Left

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.470 
is around 1.3 kilograms and on the Left
we<00:02:12.739> have<00:02:12.770> the<00:02:13.400> power<00:02:13.610> plug<00:02:13.880> and<00:02:13.910> I<00:02:14.120> can<00:02:14.300> say

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
we have the power plug and I can say

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.520 
we have the power plug and I can say
lock<00:02:14.810> the<00:02:15.650> vents<00:02:15.950> for<00:02:16.130> the<00:02:16.250> fan<00:02:16.569> the<00:02:17.569> USB<00:02:17.959> 3.0

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
set a mic jack

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.950 
set a mic jack
on<00:02:23.700> the<00:02:23.880> front<00:02:24.120> there's<00:02:24.360> pretty<00:02:24.570> much<00:02:24.630> nothing

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
on the front there's pretty much nothing

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.730 
on the front there's pretty much nothing
except<00:02:25.500> for<00:02:25.530> this<00:02:25.770> row<00:02:26.340> of<00:02:26.550> tiny<00:02:26.880> LEDs<00:02:27.510> for<00:02:28.440> the

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
except for this row of tiny LEDs for the

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.170 
except for this row of tiny LEDs for the
hard<00:02:28.920> drive<00:02:29.130> the<00:02:29.430> battery<00:02:29.760> there's<00:02:30.120> a

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
hard drive the battery there's a

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.940 
hard drive the battery there's a
obviously<00:02:31.110> they're<00:02:31.290> supposed<00:02:31.620> to<00:02:31.740> be<00:02:31.860> an

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
obviously they're supposed to be an

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.320 
obviously they're supposed to be an
add-on<00:02:32.160> battery<00:02:32.580> right<00:02:32.820> here

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
add-on battery right here

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.220 
add-on battery right here
so<00:02:34.480> they<00:02:34.930> might<00:02:35.140> be

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
so they might be

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.500 
so they might be
even<00:02:36.890> able<00:02:37.160> to<00:02:37.340> show<00:02:37.550> to<00:02:38.000> switch<00:02:38.209> the<00:02:38.390> battery

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
even able to show to switch the battery

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.920 
even able to show to switch the battery
on<00:02:38.840> it

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
on it

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.080 
on it

port of a common shape and that's pretty
much<00:03:03.700> it<00:03:03.909> that's<00:03:04.720> all<00:03:04.959> there<00:03:05.140> is

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
much it that's all there is

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.460

let's<00:03:06.519> take<00:03:06.670> a<00:03:06.700> look<00:03:06.879> at<00:03:07.060> the<00:03:07.420> lid<00:03:07.659> Fujitsu

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
let's take a look at the lid Fujitsu

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.470 
let's take a look at the lid Fujitsu
showed<00:03:08.739> off<00:03:08.920> this<00:03:09.099> in<00:03:09.310> press<00:03:09.819> shots<00:03:10.090> in<00:03:10.329> the

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
showed off this in press shots in the

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.920 
showed off this in press shots in the
red<00:03:10.659> version<00:03:10.900> so<00:03:11.470> the<00:03:11.680> lid<00:03:11.829> in<00:03:12.069> this<00:03:12.250> case<00:03:12.459> is

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
red version so the lid in this case is

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.809 
red version so the lid in this case is
black<00:03:13.930> I<00:03:14.379> don't<00:03:14.920> know<00:03:15.040> the<00:03:15.159> materials<00:03:15.639> but<00:03:15.790> I

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
black I don't know the materials but I

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:17.399 
black I don't know the materials but I
think<00:03:16.120> it's<00:03:16.269> maybe<00:03:16.599> it<00:03:16.780> might<00:03:16.959> be<00:03:17.109> magnesium

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:17.409 
think it's maybe it might be magnesium

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:21.030 
think it's maybe it might be magnesium
it<00:03:18.310> could<00:03:18.519> be<00:03:18.670> just<00:03:19.120> aluminum<00:03:19.599> but<00:03:20.440> that<00:03:20.769> is

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
it could be just aluminum but that is

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.979 
it could be just aluminum but that is
actually<00:03:21.609> a<00:03:21.639> really<00:03:21.909> sexy<00:03:22.209> Ultrabook<00:03:22.810> right

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
actually a really sexy Ultrabook right

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:25.399 
actually a really sexy Ultrabook right
here<00:03:23.230> let's<00:03:24.099> take<00:03:24.250> a<00:03:24.310> look<00:03:24.519> at<00:03:24.639> the<00:03:24.790> trackpad

00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:25.409 
here let's take a look at the trackpad

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:28.229 
here let's take a look at the trackpad
it's<00:03:26.409> really<00:03:27.159> these<00:03:27.340> on<00:03:27.519> the<00:03:27.609> sides<00:03:27.879> and<00:03:28.180> they

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
it's really these on the sides and they

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.629 
it's really these on the sides and they
have<00:03:28.540> plenty<00:03:28.780> of<00:03:28.900> room<00:03:29.139> left<00:03:29.459> so<00:03:30.459> there's

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:30.639 
have plenty of room left so there's

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:32.550 
have plenty of room left so there's
enough<00:03:30.879> enough<00:03:31.389> room<00:03:31.599> between<00:03:31.720> the<00:03:32.079> tail<00:03:32.290> that

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
enough enough room between the tail that

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.780 
enough enough room between the tail that
the<00:03:32.769> the<00:03:33.340> trackpad

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
the the trackpad

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.050 
the the trackpad
and<00:03:34.000> the<00:03:34.170> keyboard<00:03:35.170> so<00:03:35.500> you<00:03:35.620> don't<00:03:35.769> always

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
and the keyboard so you don't always

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.940 
and the keyboard so you don't always
when<00:03:37.060> you're<00:03:37.150> typing<00:03:37.810> your<00:03:38.500> you're<00:03:38.920> not

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
when you're typing your you're not

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.129 
when you're typing your you're not
activating<00:03:39.670> the<00:03:39.790> trackpad<00:03:40.239> I<00:03:40.420> hope<00:03:40.810> so<00:03:41.019> at

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:41.139 
activating the trackpad I hope so at

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:43.140 
activating the trackpad I hope so at
least<00:03:41.170> we<00:03:42.010> have<00:03:42.159> a<00:03:42.189> fingerprint<00:03:42.760> reader<00:03:42.819> and

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
least we have a fingerprint reader and

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.580 
least we have a fingerprint reader and
he'll<00:03:43.329> which<00:03:43.540> is<00:03:43.689> pretty<00:03:43.959> common<00:03:44.379> for

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
he'll which is pretty common for

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.589 
he'll which is pretty common for
Japanese<00:03:45.459> devices<00:03:46.169> there's<00:03:47.169> the<00:03:47.349> keyboard<00:03:47.769> is

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 
Japanese devices there's the keyboard is

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:50.909 
Japanese devices there's the keyboard is
there's<00:03:49.599> good<00:03:49.870> spacing<00:03:50.290> between<00:03:50.410> the<00:03:50.709> keys

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:50.919 
there's good spacing between the keys

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:54.110 
there's good spacing between the keys
but<00:03:51.190> the<00:03:51.340> key<00:03:51.519> travel<00:03:51.760> is<00:03:52.030> not<00:03:52.209> really<00:03:52.540> high

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
but the key travel is not really high

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.170 
but the key travel is not really high
but<00:03:54.659> it's<00:03:54.980> pretty<00:03:55.980> soft<00:03:56.310> to<00:03:56.489> Typhon<00:03:56.909> and<00:03:56.940> it

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
but it's pretty soft to Typhon and it
