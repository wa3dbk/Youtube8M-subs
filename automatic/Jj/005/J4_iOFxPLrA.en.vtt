00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.460 
alright that was a full of our set up
taking<00:00:19.370> the<00:00:19.400> victory<00:00:19.790> for<00:00:20.630> a<00:00:20.660> while<00:00:20.810> nothing

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.470 
taking the victory for a while nothing

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:22.990 
taking the victory for a while nothing
really<00:00:21.860> happened<00:00:22.430> for<00:00:22.610> the<00:00:22.640> people<00:00:22.910> that

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000 
really happened for the people that

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.850 
really happened for the people that
don't<00:00:23.180> really<00:00:23.300> understand<00:00:23.779> how<00:00:23.990> it<00:00:24.590> kind<00:00:24.770> of

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:24.860 
don't really understand how it kind of

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.590 
don't really understand how it kind of
exploded<00:00:25.189> what<00:00:25.520> what<00:00:25.670> exactly<00:00:26.119> went<00:00:26.240> on<00:00:26.390> I

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:26.600 
exploded what what exactly went on I

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.990 
exploded what what exactly went on I
don't<00:00:27.200> actually<00:00:27.830> I<00:00:28.070> wish<00:00:28.430> I<00:00:28.520> knew<00:00:28.550> more<00:00:28.700> about

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
don't actually I wish I knew more about

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.850 
don't actually I wish I knew more about
exactly<00:00:29.480> how<00:00:29.599> it<00:00:29.810> went<00:00:29.869> down<00:00:30.020> but<00:00:30.349> it<00:00:30.680> was

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:30.860 
exactly how it went down but it was

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.310 
exactly how it went down but it was
pretty<00:00:31.189> clear<00:00:31.460> that<00:00:31.599> obviously<00:00:32.599> Marty<00:00:33.140> needs

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
pretty clear that obviously Marty needs

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.050 
pretty clear that obviously Marty needs
to<00:00:33.530> close<00:00:33.770> in<00:00:33.980> absolutes<00:00:34.490> need<00:00:34.670> to<00:00:34.730> be<00:00:34.850> fairly

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:35.060 
to close in absolutes need to be fairly

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:39.340 
to close in absolutes need to be fairly
close<00:00:35.390> to<00:00:35.660> kill<00:00:36.440> stuff<00:00:36.650> but<00:00:37.100> the<00:00:38.079> solar<00:00:39.079> team

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
close to kill stuff but the solar team

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.030 
close to kill stuff but the solar team
was<00:00:40.329> had<00:00:41.329> tons<00:00:41.660> of<00:00:41.840> control<00:00:42.230> had<00:00:42.440> so<00:00:42.649> many<00:00:42.739> webs

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
know the mr team is trying to like push

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.960 
know the mr team is trying to like push
through<00:00:52.160> all<00:00:52.310> this<00:00:52.430> ewar<00:00:52.910> and<00:00:53.180> and<00:00:53.980> that<00:00:54.980> takes

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:55.970 
through all this ewar and and that takes

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.220 
through all this ewar and and that takes
a<00:00:56.060> while<00:00:56.270> for<00:00:56.300> them<00:00:56.660> to<00:00:56.720> do<00:00:56.900> that<00:00:57.050> I<00:00:57.080> was

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
a while for them to do that I was

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.270 
a while for them to do that I was
actually<00:00:57.290> surprised<00:00:57.740> they<00:00:57.860> were<00:00:57.950> able<00:00:58.100> to

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
actually surprised they were able to

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.090 
actually surprised they were able to
even<00:00:58.430> do<00:00:58.610> it<00:00:58.760> eventually<00:00:58.940> it<00:00:59.600> seemed<00:00:59.930> like

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
even do it eventually it seemed like

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.230 
even do it eventually it seemed like
they<00:01:01.100> had<00:01:01.130> so<00:01:01.400> much<00:01:01.520> control<00:01:01.880> they<00:01:01.910> might<00:01:02.150> be

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:02.240 
they had so much control they might be

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.790 
they had so much control they might be
able<00:01:02.330> to<00:01:02.420> hold<00:01:02.510> the<00:01:02.660> Amara<00:01:02.900> forever<00:01:03.290> but<00:01:03.560> they

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
able to hold the Amara forever but they

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.880 
able to hold the Amara forever but they
weren't<00:01:04.220> which<00:01:04.400> is<00:01:04.519> awesome<00:01:04.670> yeah<00:01:05.659> in<00:01:06.140> seeing

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
weren't which is awesome yeah in seeing

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.580 
weren't which is awesome yeah in seeing
the<00:01:07.130> solar<00:01:07.490> flee<00:01:07.700> team<00:01:07.939> like<00:01:08.659> I<00:01:08.810> really<00:01:09.350> think

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
the solar flee team like I really think

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.819 
the solar flee team like I really think
that<00:01:10.360> bombers<00:01:11.360> were<00:01:12.079> not<00:01:12.290> the<00:01:12.439> right<00:01:12.619> choice

00:01:12.819 --> 00:01:12.829 
that bombers were not the right choice

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:16.060 
that bombers were not the right choice
there<00:01:13.159> I<00:01:13.340> think<00:01:14.210> that<00:01:14.390> they<00:01:14.990> had<00:01:15.229> some<00:01:15.680> damage

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
there I think that they had some damage

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.940 
there I think that they had some damage
and<00:01:16.280> the<00:01:16.540> the<00:01:17.540> main<00:01:17.750> advantage<00:01:18.440> of<00:01:18.860> those

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
and the the main advantage of those

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.460 
and the the main advantage of those
bombers<00:01:19.280> in<00:01:19.460> that<00:01:19.610> fight<00:01:19.880> was<00:01:20.570> the<00:01:21.050> damps<00:01:21.380> they

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
bombers in that fight was the damps they

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:22.930 
bombers in that fight was the damps they
initially<00:01:21.710> put<00:01:22.010> on<00:01:22.159> if<00:01:22.370> they<00:01:22.490> killed<00:01:22.820> an

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
initially put on if they killed an

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.090 
initially put on if they killed an
absolution<00:01:23.360> early<00:01:23.900> wooden<00:01:24.650> they<00:01:24.800> were<00:01:24.890> while

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
absolution early wooden they were while

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.980 
absolution early wooden they were while
they<00:01:25.220> were<00:01:25.310> damping<00:01:25.700> out<00:01:25.820> the<00:01:25.970> logistics<00:01:26.570> of

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
they were damping out the logistics of

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.570 
they were damping out the logistics of
razor<00:01:27.260> then<00:01:27.920> that<00:01:28.070> fight<00:01:28.250> could<00:01:28.370> have<00:01:28.460> gone

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
razor then that fight could have gone

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.800 
razor then that fight could have gone
entirely<00:01:28.850> differently<00:01:29.330> but<00:01:30.050> I<00:01:30.380> just<00:01:31.220> I<00:01:31.460> really

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
entirely differently but I just I really

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.880 
entirely differently but I just I really
unless<00:01:32.810> you're<00:01:32.990> doing<00:01:33.200> a<00:01:33.260> bombing<00:01:33.470> run<00:01:33.680> at<00:01:33.830> the

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
unless you're doing a bombing run at the

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.410 
unless you're doing a bombing run at the
beginning<00:01:34.159> I<00:01:34.430> really<00:01:34.909> don't<00:01:35.090> like<00:01:35.120> that<00:01:35.300> many

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
beginning I really don't like that many

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.060 
beginning I really don't like that many
bombers<00:01:35.810> I<00:01:36.050> think<00:01:36.560> the<00:01:36.620> coolest<00:01:36.830> thing<00:01:37.040> in

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
bombers I think the coolest thing in

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.500 
bombers I think the coolest thing in
that<00:01:37.250> match<00:01:37.400> and<00:01:37.729> the<00:01:37.940> thing<00:01:38.060> I<00:01:38.180> want<00:01:38.300> to<00:01:38.420> know

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:38.510 
that match and the thing I want to know

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.000 
that match and the thing I want to know
more<00:01:38.659> about<00:01:38.720> is<00:01:38.990> the<00:01:39.080> curses<00:01:39.470> because<00:01:39.860> I<00:01:39.890> think

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.010 
more about is the curses because I think

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.039 
more about is the curses because I think
their<00:01:40.280> job<00:01:40.310> was<00:01:40.670> so<00:01:40.790> tough<00:01:41.030> 8<00:01:41.240> they<00:01:41.750> need<00:01:41.960> to

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
their job was so tough 8 they need to

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:44.440 
their job was so tough 8 they need to
break<00:01:42.229> the<00:01:42.409> Oneiros<00:01:42.710> so<00:01:43.130> that<00:01:43.280> they<00:01:43.400> can<00:01:43.640> get

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
break the Oneiros so that they can get

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:45.580 
break the Oneiros so that they can get
through<00:01:44.630> the<00:01:44.750> tank<00:01:44.990> from<00:01:45.170> the<00:01:45.290> other<00:01:45.409> team

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
through the tank from the other team

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.700 
through the tank from the other team
they<00:01:45.799> also<00:01:45.979> need<00:01:46.280> to<00:01:46.430> probably<00:01:47.049> take<00:01:48.049> the<00:01:48.530> cap

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
they also need to probably take the cap

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.340 
they also need to probably take the cap
away<00:01:48.950> from<00:01:49.159> Hugh<00:01:49.400> gan's<00:01:49.870> so<00:01:50.870> that<00:01:51.049> they<00:01:51.170> can

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
away from Hugh gan's so that they can

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.320 
away from Hugh gan's so that they can
get<00:01:51.500> the<00:01:51.710> episodes<00:01:52.159> delivered<00:01:52.640> to<00:01:53.240> the

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
get the episodes delivered to the

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.410 
get the episodes delivered to the
Bombers<00:01:53.630> so<00:01:53.870> i<00:01:54.049> think<00:01:54.170> that<00:01:54.350> the<00:01:54.799> pilots

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
Bombers so i think that the pilots

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.730 
Bombers so i think that the pilots
probably<00:01:56.420> had<00:01:56.510> a<00:01:56.540> lot<00:01:56.570> to<00:01:56.840> do<00:01:56.990> and<00:01:57.200> it<00:01:57.560> would<00:01:57.710> be

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
probably had a lot to do and it would be

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.170 
probably had a lot to do and it would be
cool<00:01:57.979> to<00:01:58.010> know<00:01:58.190> kind<00:01:58.460> of<00:01:58.490> exactly<00:01:58.970> how<00:01:59.119> that

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
cool to know kind of exactly how that

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.590 
cool to know kind of exactly how that
went<00:01:59.360> down<00:01:59.479> but<00:01:59.770> really<00:02:00.770> cool<00:02:00.950> match

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
went down but really cool match

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.880 
went down but really cool match
definitely<00:02:02.600> and<00:02:02.750> as<00:02:02.960> soon<00:02:03.140> as<00:02:03.290> those<00:02:03.440> assholes

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
definitely and as soon as those assholes

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.910 
definitely and as soon as those assholes
got<00:02:04.010> in<00:02:04.390> absolutes<00:02:05.390> as<00:02:05.810> well<00:02:06.080> as<00:02:06.409> absolute<00:02:06.830> as

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
got in absolutes as well as absolute as

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.100 
got in absolutes as well as absolute as
both<00:02:07.159> sitting<00:02:07.460> and<00:02:07.520> sitting<00:02:07.940> outside<00:02:08.149> as<00:02:08.899> soon

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
both sitting and sitting outside as soon

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.509 
both sitting and sitting outside as soon
as<00:02:09.200> those<00:02:09.349> absolutes<00:02:09.920> got<00:02:10.069> into<00:02:10.310> stealth

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:10.519 
as those absolutes got into stealth

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:11.920 
as those absolutes got into stealth
bombers<00:02:10.819> just<00:02:11.030> started<00:02:11.269> exploding<00:02:11.510> left<00:02:11.810> and

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
bombers just started exploding left and

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.630 
bombers just started exploding left and
right<00:02:12.049> yeah<00:02:12.349> but<00:02:12.739> the<00:02:12.950> nearest<00:02:13.370> for<00:02:13.549> the

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
right yeah but the nearest for the

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.280 
right yeah but the nearest for the
Bombers<00:02:14.060> did<00:02:14.239> a<00:02:14.269> great<00:02:14.569> job<00:02:14.599> they<00:02:15.049> had<00:02:15.170> to

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
Bombers did a great job they had to

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.839 
Bombers did a great job they had to
bounce<00:02:15.439> back<00:02:15.709> and<00:02:15.860> forth<00:02:15.950> between<00:02:16.250> targets

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
bounce back and forth between targets

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:18.670 
bounce back and forth between targets
and<00:02:17.090> they<00:02:17.150> had<00:02:17.269> to<00:02:17.360> he<00:02:17.689> was<00:02:17.810> under<00:02:18.049> cat

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
and they had to he was under cat

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.140 
and they had to he was under cat
pressure<00:02:18.920> for<00:02:19.189> sure<00:02:19.340> I<00:02:19.370> think<00:02:19.549> he<00:02:19.909> the

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
pressure for sure I think he the

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.610 
pressure for sure I think he the
logistics<00:02:20.510> pilot<00:02:20.780> for<00:02:20.930> solar<00:02:21.110> did<00:02:21.319> a<00:02:21.380> great

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
logistics pilot for solar did a great

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.860 
logistics pilot for solar did a great
job<00:02:21.650> in<00:02:21.860> that<00:02:22.069> match<00:02:22.220> I<00:02:22.490> think<00:02:22.910> in<00:02:23.150> most<00:02:23.360> setups

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
job in that match I think in most setups

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.930 
job in that match I think in most setups
when<00:02:24.319> there's<00:02:24.470> a<00:02:24.530> logistics<00:02:25.099> ship<00:02:25.310> full<00:02:25.640> just

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
when there's a logistics ship full just

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:26.559 
when there's a logistics ship full just
expel

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569

structures onto the map from like a

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:53.500 
structures onto the map from like a
commander's<00:02:51.620> point<00:02:51.859> of<00:02:51.950> view<00:02:52.239> but<00:02:53.239> I<00:02:53.299> didn't

chosen<00:02:57.889> like<00:02:58.219> didn't<00:02:58.579> seem<00:02:58.730> like<00:02:58.760> a<00:02:58.939> where<00:02:59.599> you

00:02:59.679 --> 00:02:59.689 
chosen like didn't seem like a where you

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:01.780 
chosen like didn't seem like a where you
wanted<00:02:59.900> to<00:02:59.930> go<00:02:59.989> with<00:03:00.079> the<00:03:00.169> gameplay<00:03:00.609> we<00:03:01.609> are

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
wanted to go with the gameplay we are

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.740 
wanted to go with the gameplay we are
going<00:03:01.939> to<00:03:02.000> have<00:03:02.150> the<00:03:02.469> commander<00:03:03.469> mode<00:03:03.620> in<00:03:04.750> we

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
going to have the commander mode in we

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.470 
going to have the commander mode in we
think<00:03:05.930> it's<00:03:06.109> a<00:03:06.290> really<00:03:06.709> cool<00:03:07.010> feature

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
think it's a really cool feature

think it's a really cool feature
specifically<00:03:08.480> from<00:03:08.689> like<00:03:09.319> an<00:03:09.439> RTS<00:03:09.769> know<00:03:10.519> some

point when exactly we don't know yet but

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.809 
point when exactly we don't know yet but
we<00:03:15.949> have<00:03:15.980> a<00:03:17.139> super<00:03:18.139> aggressive<00:03:18.819> expansion

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:19.819 
we have a super aggressive expansion
