 11 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:12.280
 thought marco up from honest food 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:14.709
 Today we make pizza and pizza 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.199

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:18.640
 high ground has exactly this pizza 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:20.679
 we make with me the kitchen today whether 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.640
 I do that anytime and as always down there 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:27.490
 in my kitchen for our pizza dough 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.960
 I have my kitchen machine here now 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.910
 Of course you can also take that with you 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.500
 make a dough mixer or with a 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:36.880
 Kitchen holds and hands completely 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:40.690
 of course we have 300 grams of normal 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:42.940
 wheat flour type 0 0 the super type for 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:46.000
 but their company is also 300 grams 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.940
 wheat flour 100 grams of durum wheat semolina and 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.150
 a teaspoon of salt I feel that first 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.150
 even a 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:07.270
 100 milliliters are now available 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:07.270
 lukewarm water so directly from the tap 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:15.080
 and here 100 meter lukewarm milk because 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:19.280
 a tablespoon of sugar with it in and one 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.740
 fresh yeast cube pureed 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:25.810
 but I already dissolved 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:31.729
 that takes so 23 minutes to stir 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:35.390
 comes in there and now two more 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:36.940
 tablespoons of olive oil are also in the 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.270
 dough 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.270
 that was the first one 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:48.200
 that is a second and now we are leaving 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:51.880
 the machine work for us 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.880
 until a smooth dough arises 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.000
 but now not the whole would have 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:12.760
 I'll watch when the time comes 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:16.500
 me back so far finished the machine 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.500
 we do not need those constantly gone 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:25.950
 and now we have one here 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:29.430
 wonderful day of getting it right 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:32.080
 great process 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:44.290
 spitzenmäßig the credit still 23 times with 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:48.849
 hands and the special on this day 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:52.180
 now it does not have to be great 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:56.019
 Now we go as loud as we process 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:59.440
 right now also a pizza tin 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:02.470
 I can show you my can smell 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:10.810
 halves me for exactly one pizza 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:19.959
 other way and the roles we are 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:24.730
 Now out of here you can still have them 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:28.600
 then he will also be larger, I hope one 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:32.889
 and you'll see 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:34.870
 the way it goes on, that's one 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:36.069
 joke on the tin that you can everywhere 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.260
 Buy it felt like 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:40.599
 olive oil 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:44.440
 Now we have to make our pond beautiful 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:45.970
 rhyming then rather so extremely supple 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.930
 in the meeting that also without further notice 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:51.269
 if there is no problem 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.680
 to press 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:56.069
 dough in the other direction a bit 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:00.190
 to force 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:02.370
 the problem is not pizza 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.370
 baker 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:15.150
 otherwise we would also load in the vitter 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.920
 work and not here not in the 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.710
 kitchen and you have to look like 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:25.020
 you do that so that pizza tin into the 

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:27.270
 Proof wise the pizza is a tin and 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.760
 as she is now she is 20 minutes 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.630
 to go in a warm place I am the 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.360
 company open 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.580
 I put that on 40 degrees and 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:39.600
 there the dough goes now 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:40.830
 relaxed 20 minutes 20 minutes was the 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.220
 dough now in there and you can see here 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:46.740
 really nice came up again 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:50.040
 and now we will make it 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:58.800
 a pizza pizza smeared the edge 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:05:00.420
 now with olive oil that prevents 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.820
 after that the request becomes 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:15.900
 so it stays pretty fluffy as we do them 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:18.120
 also know and and still want to 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.770
 far , peters had to come as good 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.750
 pizza sauce I did in a video 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:24.050
 ever shown you can here 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.050
 look at 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:28.220
 leave a nice edge 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.010
 dollar 

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:43.380
 so you can go next to sophie you want here 

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:48.550
 should achieve that 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:54.210
 and now crisis and cheese on the 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:54.210
 sauce and best grated mozzarella 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:01.419
 Of course you can also do it every time 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:06.960
 but next to it open really good pizza 

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:06.960
 in my opinion belongs to a crisis 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:14.039
 and now we're doing the classic 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:18.990
 salami pizza 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:33.979
 and this pizza sheet disappears 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:34.930
 now in the oven preheated to 250 

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:40.479
 Degree 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:43.009
 bottom sheet metal 250 degrees 

00:06:40.479 --> 00:06:44.750
 and because the places are finished 

00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:47.120
 so they are perfect for the places 

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:48.470
 finished then we will get in touch 

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:53.470
 I'll contact you again and we'll meet 

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:53.470
 again so they say oliver 

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:58.460
 twelve minutes later is the pizza 

00:06:55.849 --> 00:07:01.039
 finished the hole I get out of the now 

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.970
 advance the mold onto a plate then 

00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:04.069
 is eaten 

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:06.620
 I think you look great 

00:07:04.069 --> 00:07:08.509
 so dear people pizza hat pizza after 

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:12.409

00:07:12.409 --> 00:07:18.259
