 Hello everyone, today we make together 

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:12.809
 this cocoa cake that I then have 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:16.850
 stuffed with a coffee cream 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:21.119
 the ingredients are 150 g of 00 flour 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:25.650
 100 g of potato starch 50 g of cocoa 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:30.180
 bitter 50 g of seed oil 150 g of 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:33.980

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:36.390

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.449
 optional 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.039
 let us then proceed to the procedure in one 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:45.960
 bowl we combine all the ingredients 

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:48.440
 dried then corn flour was then the 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.440

00:00:53.180 --> 00:01:12.930

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.590

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.590
 every day 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.560
 at this point we can begin to for 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.770
 do the fullback always mixing with 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.770
 a whip 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:47.570

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.730
 we bake at 180 degrees of about 30 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.730

 you can stuff it or leave it 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.990
