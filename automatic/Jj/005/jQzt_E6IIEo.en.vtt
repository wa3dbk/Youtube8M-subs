00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:06.120
 Here is franz today for updated there 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.160
 the commander is not currently in 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.080
 Germany further asked me that 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.500
 to unpack iphone 6 for you 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.599
 this is available today or yesterday 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.740
 depending on when this video he online 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.840
 goes and of course we want it 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.970
 unpack because it is one of the 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.980
 most interesting devices this year 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.320
 not very interesting is the 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.970
 The packaging looks very minimalistic 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.340
 as one or the other may say 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.390
 I just think it's just boring 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.520
 whole looks like a normal one 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.719
 Wise packing but if you are exactly 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.790
 you can see here on the 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.500
 front the silhouette of the iphone 6 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.420
 Apple thought something at 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.120
 but that's just the packaging 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.040
 here the iphone logo on the back 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.140
 Do you see how much memory? 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.879
 you have the 64 gb model here 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:53.160
 there are also 16 or 128 gb each 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.489
 after how much memory you have 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.379
 I would like to start at 690 euro 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.410
 would say we do the same all the same 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.180
 Let's go and here we go 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.760
 ever the star of the show 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.380
 iphone 6 that we want here times 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.040
 We'll see you soon 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.470
 more exactly 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.680
 here then under this shell we find 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.830
 the usual paper stuff in one 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.590
 such cray you can see it here for a short time 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.720
 quick start guide warranty information 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.390
 the obligatory apples thicker and 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.650
 the image tool by which their 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.020
 for example, insert the sim card 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.540
 You can do it in a classic way 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.310
 lightning on usb cable there was nothing 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.600
 changed in comparison to the iphone 5 or 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.100
 iphone 5 it still here the power supply 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.950
 Also kept in white with an output 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.810
 from 1 ampere without then we have here 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.270
 even the apple i pods the 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.200
 standard head there too 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.390
 not really something 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.420
 they are already being changed 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.790
 since the iphone 5 so included the 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.600
 Scope of delivery is really pretty 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.000
 unspectacular there are as good as 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.520
 nothing new but that will be 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.770
 now we want to get that 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.479
 take a closer look at iphone 6 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.390
 I'll give you those very fast 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.160
 dimensions through the here have 138 x 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.020
 67 mm 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.640
 that is definitely okay 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.560
 gives 4.7 inch device 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.660
 they are small, there are some 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.670
 a bit bigger, but if we are here 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.680
 we see iphone 6 plus next to it 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.190
 the iphone 6 is definitely still nice 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.900
 handy 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.630
 So you can not complain 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.900
 besides, it is 6 9 millimeters thin and 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.940
 weighs only 129 grams is super in the 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.990
 hand through this design I like that 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.180
 very well 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:38.370
 on the front he gave me a 47 inch 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:40.290
 large display that solves with 1334 x 750 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.830
 Pixel on and you have to times 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.690
 give 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.660
 then we come back to apples 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:48.260
 beloved 326 pixels per inch we have 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.459
 a 12 megapixel front camera earpiece 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.470
 and down here the physical home button 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.750
 at the same time also as 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.370
 Fingerprint sensor acts look 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.150
 we get something from the side 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.070
 more exactly 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.380
 left then the courage button as well as the 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:03.269
 keys for loud and quiet on the 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.060
 base a lightning port on 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:08.700
 speaker a microphone and the 35 mm 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.739
 jack connection right the impression for 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.140
 a nano should be considered if so 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:15.090
 you look at the iphone 6 then brings next 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.680
 the power button in my eyes like that 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.110
 from the first impression, yes, very well 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.120
 is placed and above then absolutely 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.560
 nothing that is kept long 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.910
 we would be at the back 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.290
 arrived that exists again 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.230
 aluminum there are three different ones 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.540
 colors here space gray next to silver 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.790
 and also gold you can rest in what 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.530
 you like it best we have one 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.230
 eight megapixel main camera with one 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:40.890
 improved sensor unfortunately that was synonymous 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.450
 something out means that devices teeter 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.090
 very easy if you put it on the 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.920
 The cover is laid, however 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.780
 made of sapphire crystal apple promises 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.610
 So the whole thing should not be too strong 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.190
 Let's scratch it like we look 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:56.010
 the so in the practice test beats otherwise 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:58.650
 the turkey led as we already from the 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.209
 iphone bms know a microphone and here 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.519
 then of course the apple logo 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:05.010
 the camera still has a blindfold 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:06.750
 from f 2.2 or as I said the sensor 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.299
 has just been improved autofocus 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.170
 faster there should be a lot with 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:12.120
 to be possible 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.859
 otherwise we have a 1810th 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.630
 The powerful battery of the 

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:19.320
 unfortunately it is permanently installed and you have 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:21.470
 just 16 64 or 128 gigabytes of internal 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.150
 memory and that can 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.700
 also not be extended how to do that 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:28.670
 just as Apple knows first impression 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:30.470
 from the iphone 6 + very very high from the iphone 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:33.710
 6 excuses very high quality device 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.000
 is very good in the hand and especially 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.380
 also the display makes a good one 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.550
 impression that I show you now 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.380
 fast you can just hear that 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.780
 unlock over your fingerprint 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.030
 just a little longer here on the button 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.470
 then we can click here 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.640
 display brightness slightly down 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.830
 Realize that they really are something 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.930
 recognizes as I said the display makes 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.850
 a very good impression contrast values 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.220
 are super brightness are supervisor 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:58.070
 is super black value is also very very 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:00.460
 good for such an ips display and also the 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:02.990
 performance really knows how to convince 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:09.400
 if we just go fast here 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:11.480
 a thing to give eg updated point de 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.370
 and that can be here at google 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:15.320
 Search and then in the shop you will 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.130
 It will be very, really, very nice to see 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.450
 quickly loaded 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:19.130
 that's really fun here as well 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.660
 performance is great there is 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.400
 nothing to criticize at all 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:25.520
 as an operating system we have of course 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:27.740
 ios 8 as processor the apple a8 with the 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.810
 careless core processor for example 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:32.180
 for party the 1 gb 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:33.200
 RAM and lte to the mobile 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.930
 data transmission 

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:38.479
 that was a short unboxing hands-on and 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.979
 first impression of the new apple iphone 6 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:41.570
 I thank you for watching 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:43.280
 Hope the video we liked you 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:47.560
 we'll be back somewhere 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.560
 at youtube then in this sense
