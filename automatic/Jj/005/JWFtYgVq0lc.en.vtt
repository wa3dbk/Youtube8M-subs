figure here the UK Edition does not
however<00:00:33.570> I<00:00:34.230> think<00:00:35.130> that<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:36.120> really<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.720> end

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:36.900 
however I think that is really the end

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.040 
however I think that is really the end
of<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.440> better<00:00:37.620> packaging<00:00:38.160> here<00:00:38.630> a<00:00:39.630> lot<00:00:39.960> of

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
that the US Edition packaging is awful

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.540 
that the US Edition packaging is awful
and<00:00:46.829> I<00:00:47.010> agree<00:00:47.280> with<00:00:47.310> them<00:00:47.930> so<00:00:49.340> try<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.370> do<00:00:50.489> this

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
and I agree with them so try to do this

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.799 
and I agree with them so try to do this

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:36.280 

who<00:04:28.280> these<00:04:29.240> are<00:04:29.630> snug<00:04:32.680> all<00:04:33.680> right<00:04:35.080> so<00:04:36.080> here<00:04:36.260> we

who these are snug all right so here we

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:42.660 
who these are snug all right so here we
have<00:04:36.530> it<00:04:37.150> so<00:04:38.150> I'd<00:04:38.240> like<00:04:38.390> to<00:04:38.450> get<00:04:38.660> this<00:04:38.810> one<00:04:41.560> too

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:42.670 
have it so I'd like to get this one too

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:47.470 
have it so I'd like to get this one too
they<00:04:43.670> come<00:04:43.850> in<00:04:43.940> this<00:04:44.060> nice<00:04:44.240> little<00:04:46.480> pack

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:47.480 
they come in this nice little pack

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:52.390 
they come in this nice little pack
instead<00:04:48.290> of<00:04:48.470> over<00:04:48.830> here<00:04:49.040> or<00:04:49.490> it's<00:04:49.820> not<00:04:51.400> anyway

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
instead of over here or it's not anyway

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.220 
instead of over here or it's not anyway
that's<00:04:52.640> the<00:04:53.390> big<00:04:53.570> difference<00:04:53.870> between<00:04:53.960> the

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:54.230 
that's the big difference between the

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:58.390 
that's the big difference between the
two<00:04:55.720> this<00:04:56.720> is<00:04:57.020> quite<00:04:57.470> a<00:04:57.500> bit<00:04:57.710> cheaper<00:04:57.740> if<00:04:58.250> you

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
two this is quite a bit cheaper if you

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:04.150 
two this is quite a bit cheaper if you
order<00:04:58.670> it<00:04:58.760> from<00:04:58.970> amazon<00:04:59.420> co<00:05:00.140> uk<00:05:00.910> and<00:05:02.980> it<00:05:03.980> takes

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
order it from amazon co uk and it takes

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.030 
order it from amazon co uk and it takes
a<00:05:04.250> longer<00:05:04.490> ship<00:05:04.910> but<00:05:05.480> the<00:05:06.410> conversion<00:05:06.770> rate

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:07.040 
a longer ship but the conversion rate

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.380 
a longer ship but the conversion rate
right<00:05:07.250> now<00:05:07.400> this<00:05:07.520> is<00:05:07.670> running<00:05:08.090> about<00:05:08.270> one

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:08.390 
right now this is running about one

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:12.040 
right now this is running about one
hundred<00:05:08.600> and<00:05:08.690> sixty<00:05:09.110> six<00:05:09.590> dollars<00:05:11.050> converted

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 
hundred and sixty six dollars converted

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.890 
hundred and sixty six dollars converted
to<00:05:12.200> us<00:05:12.500> and<00:05:12.860> this<00:05:13.190> is<00:05:13.430> a<00:05:13.460> two<00:05:14.270> hundred<00:05:14.360> seven

shipped it to me and it's not into the
lease<00:05:44.480> but<00:05:44.720> one<00:05:44.900> thing<00:05:45.110> that<00:05:45.140> I<00:05:45.290> did<00:05:45.500> notice<00:05:46.810> on

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:47.810 
lease but one thing that I did notice on

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:51.160 
lease but one thing that I did notice on
the<00:05:47.930> back<00:05:48.310> you<00:05:49.310> can<00:05:49.370> read<00:05:49.640> it<00:05:49.820> says<00:05:50.170> to

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:51.170 
the back you can read it says to

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:54.560 
the back you can read it says to
extended<00:05:51.770> episodes

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:54.570 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:59.480 

I<00:05:55.280> did<00:05:56.280> a<00:05:56.520> disc<00:05:57.180> by<00:05:57.510> disc<00:05:57.840> comparison<00:05:58.710> and<00:05:58.920> they

00:05:59.480 --> 00:05:59.490 
I did a disc by disc comparison and they

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.480 
I did a disc by disc comparison and they
seem<00:05:59.760> to<00:05:59.790> have<00:06:00.200> identical<00:06:01.200> content<00:06:01.980> on<00:06:02.460> both

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:02.490 
seem to have identical content on both

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:05.480 
seem to have identical content on both
discs<00:06:03.210> so<00:06:03.930> this<00:06:04.170> has<00:06:04.350> a<00:06:04.380> way<00:06:04.950> more<00:06:05.220> than<00:06:05.340> two

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:05.490 
discs so this has a way more than two

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.420 
discs so this has a way more than two
extended<00:06:05.970> scenes<00:06:06.210> I<00:06:06.450> think<00:06:06.780> that<00:06:06.960> was<00:06:07.140> like

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:07.430 
extended scenes I think that was like

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:10.990 
extended scenes I think that was like
the<00:06:08.430> text<00:06:08.910> because<00:06:09.540> I<00:06:09.660> think<00:06:09.720> just<00:06:10.050> for<00:06:10.170> season

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:11.000 
the text because I think just for season

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.730 
the text because I think just for season
4.5<00:06:12.740> what<00:06:13.740> the<00:06:13.890> UK<00:06:14.250> calls<00:06:14.550> the<00:06:14.970> final<00:06:15.420> season

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:15.740 
4.5 what the UK calls the final season

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.890 
4.5 what the UK calls the final season
so<00:06:16.740> don't<00:06:17.550> believe<00:06:17.730> the<00:06:18.060> back<00:06:18.240> right<00:06:18.720> there

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:18.900 
so don't believe the back right there

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.480 
so don't believe the back right there
where<00:06:19.050> it<00:06:19.140> says<00:06:19.170> two<00:06:19.440> extended<00:06:19.890> episodes<00:06:20.250> and

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:20.490 
where it says two extended episodes and

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:23.450 
where it says two extended episodes and

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:23.460 
another thing is this is kind of part of

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:26.330 
another thing is this is kind of part of
