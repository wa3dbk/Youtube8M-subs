00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.440 
actually really did that a lot so for
the<00:03:57.570> Thor<00:03:57.840> I'm<00:03:58.080> really<00:03:58.350> liking<00:03:58.590> it<00:03:59.360> yeah<00:04:00.360> all

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
the Thor I'm really liking it yeah all

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.120 
the Thor I'm really liking it yeah all
that<00:04:00.660> extra<00:04:00.990> armor<00:04:01.410> and<00:04:01.500> stuff<00:04:01.770> I<00:04:01.920> don't<00:04:02.070> know

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
that extra armor and stuff I don't know

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.000 
that extra armor and stuff I don't know
I<00:04:02.160> think<00:04:02.310> it<00:04:02.550> just<00:04:02.580> goes<00:04:03.060> with<00:04:03.450> the<00:04:03.480> whole

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
I think it just goes with the whole

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.440 
I think it just goes with the whole
Asgardian<00:04:05.010> concept<00:04:05.640> and<00:04:05.850> everything<00:04:05.970> you

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
Asgardian concept and everything you

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.590 
Asgardian concept and everything you
know<00:04:06.570> and<00:04:06.810> then<00:04:07.350> he<00:04:07.380> has<00:04:08.060> the<00:04:09.060> own<00:04:09.180> there<00:04:09.390> right

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
know and then he has the own there right

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.330 
know and then he has the own there right
there<00:04:09.810> with<00:04:09.930> the<00:04:10.020> Lightning<00:04:10.440> and<00:04:10.740> stuff<00:04:11.160> and

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
there with the Lightning and stuff and

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.340 
there with the Lightning and stuff and
then<00:04:11.460> this<00:04:11.640> swoosh<00:04:12.060> effect<00:04:12.510> is<00:04:12.660> really<00:04:13.110> sick

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
then this swoosh effect is really sick

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:14.510 
then this swoosh effect is really sick
this<00:04:13.500> is<00:04:13.560> the<00:04:13.650> first<00:04:13.890> time<00:04:14.070> I've<00:04:14.190> seen<00:04:14.340> this

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
liking that a lot and then we also have

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.580 
liking that a lot and then we also have
the<00:04:30.180> variant<00:04:30.540> Iron<00:04:30.810> Man<00:04:30.990> right<00:04:31.020> over<00:04:31.410> there

what<00:05:35.459> I<00:05:35.519> mean<00:05:35.639> you<00:05:36.329> get<00:05:36.419> the<00:05:36.569> peanut<00:05:36.869> on<00:05:36.989> waves

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:37.229 
what I mean you get the peanut on waves

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:39.169 
what I mean you get the peanut on waves
so<00:05:37.589> it's<00:05:37.860> not<00:05:37.979> bad<00:05:38.189> design<00:05:38.579> it's<00:05:38.789> just<00:05:38.849> down

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:39.179 
so it's not bad design it's just down

00:05:39.179 --> 00:05:41.500 
so it's not bad design it's just down
over<00:05:39.509> Spidey<00:05:39.839> I'm<00:05:39.989> not<00:05:40.169> a<00:05:40.199> huge<00:05:40.439> fan<00:05:40.529> of<00:05:40.739> it

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:41.510 
over Spidey I'm not a huge fan of it

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:43.930 
over Spidey I'm not a huge fan of it
but<00:05:41.990> doesn't<00:05:42.440> look<00:05:42.530> bad<00:05:42.740> and<00:05:43.130> get<00:05:43.340> the<00:05:43.550> flippin

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:43.940 
but doesn't look bad and get the flippin

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:45.520 
but doesn't look bad and get the flippin
hands<00:05:44.150> and<00:05:44.450> all<00:05:44.570> this<00:05:44.690> stuff<00:05:45.170> and<00:05:45.350> some

webbing<00:05:45.920> you<00:05:46.100> know<00:05:46.250> that<00:05:46.490> looks<00:05:47.390> pretty<00:05:47.540> cool

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 
webbing you know that looks pretty cool

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.870 
webbing you know that looks pretty cool
I<00:05:48.050> think<00:05:48.260> I<00:05:48.290> want<00:05:48.470> to<00:05:48.500> get<00:05:48.680> it<00:05:48.830> you<00:05:49.070> know<00:05:49.760> I'm

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:49.880 
I think I want to get it you know I'm

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.190 
I think I want to get it you know I'm
saying<00:05:50.210> I'm<00:05:50.360> not<00:05:50.480> a<00:05:50.540> big<00:05:50.660> fan<00:05:50.780> of<00:05:50.840> it<00:05:51.020> but<00:05:51.140> I

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:51.200 
saying I'm not a big fan of it but I

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.500 
saying I'm not a big fan of it but I
want<00:05:51.500> it<00:05:51.650> at<00:05:51.950> the<00:05:52.010> same<00:05:52.220> time<00:05:52.550> please<00:05:52.850> know

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:53.510 
want it at the same time please know

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:55.090 
want it at the same time please know
it's<00:05:53.660> pretty<00:05:53.900> cool<00:05:54.080> but<00:05:54.500> this<00:05:54.740> looks<00:05:54.950> super

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:55.100 
it's pretty cool but this looks super

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:56.470 
it's pretty cool but this looks super
sick<00:05:55.520> to<00:05:55.640> me<00:05:55.730> and<00:05:55.850> I<00:05:55.880> wish<00:05:56.000> they<00:05:56.150> had<00:05:56.330> it<00:05:56.420> on

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:56.480 
sick to me and I wish they had it on

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.360 
sick to me and I wish they had it on
display<00:05:56.600> here<00:05:57.230> but<00:05:57.470> we<00:05:57.620> get<00:05:57.770> the<00:05:57.860> superior

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:58.370 
display here but we get the superior

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.460 
display here but we get the superior
venom<00:05:58.790> where<00:05:59.240> it's<00:05:59.360> a<00:05:59.450> variant<00:05:59.960> venom<00:06:00.260> but<00:06:00.380> it

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:00.470 
venom where it's a variant venom but it

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:02.800 
venom where it's a variant venom but it
reminds<00:06:00.830> me<00:06:00.890> of<00:06:00.980> superior<00:06:01.490> venom<00:06:01.850> and<00:06:02.540> I<00:06:02.600> think

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:02.810 
reminds me of superior venom and I think

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:04.810 
reminds me of superior venom and I think
this<00:06:02.960> kind<00:06:03.140> of<00:06:03.230> design<00:06:03.560> matches<00:06:03.860> the<00:06:04.430> venom

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:04.820 
this kind of design matches the venom

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:08.110 
this kind of design matches the venom
very<00:06:05.120> very<00:06:05.420> well<00:06:05.660> I<00:06:06.040> think<00:06:07.040> this<00:06:07.340> concept<00:06:07.850> art

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:08.120 
very very well I think this concept art

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.000 
very very well I think this concept art
for<00:06:08.360> the<00:06:08.630> design<00:06:08.900> of<00:06:08.990> the<00:06:09.050> figures<00:06:09.380> are

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:10.010 
for the design of the figures are

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:11.800 
for the design of the figures are
actually<00:06:10.190> quite<00:06:10.550> perfect<00:06:10.970> for<00:06:11.150> venom<00:06:11.420> I'm

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:11.810 
actually quite perfect for venom I'm

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:14.350 
actually quite perfect for venom I'm
really<00:06:12.050> digging<00:06:12.320> that<00:06:12.470> a<00:06:12.500> lot<00:06:13.040> so<00:06:13.490> that<00:06:14.120> one<00:06:14.270> I
