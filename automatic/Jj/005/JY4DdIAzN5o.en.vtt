00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
it go in one ear and out the other good

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.380 
it go in one ear and out the other good
or<00:00:57.809> bad<00:00:58.020> so<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.559> hear<00:00:58.770> both<00:01:01.460> kind<00:01:02.460> of<00:01:02.550> snug<00:01:02.820> on

a<00:01:03.559> 20<00:01:04.559> hour<00:01:04.650> show<00:01:04.890> so<00:01:05.070> I<00:01:05.129> think<00:01:05.189> they<00:01:05.460> did<00:01:05.489> that

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
a 20 hour show so I think they did that

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:12.670 
a 20 hour show so I think they did that
better<00:01:06.000> but<00:01:06.869> I<00:01:06.930> still<00:01:07.140> had<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.320> good<00:01:07.470> time<00:01:07.530> for<00:01:07.890> I

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.859 

mean<00:01:13.680> I<00:01:14.100> always<00:01:15.030> had<00:01:15.240> trouble<00:01:15.360> benching

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
mean I always had trouble benching

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.240 
mean I always had trouble benching
though<00:01:16.020> but<00:01:16.259> because<00:01:16.590> my<00:01:16.740> arms<00:01:17.040> are<00:01:17.100> so<00:01:17.220> long

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
though but because my arms are so long

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.310 
though but because my arms are so long
but<00:01:17.759> I<00:01:18.119> thought<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:18.689> was<00:01:18.869> gonna<00:01:18.990> at<00:01:19.080> least<00:01:19.110> get

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
but I thought I was gonna at least get

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.340 
but I thought I was gonna at least get
10<00:01:19.700> but<00:01:20.700> I<00:01:20.729> guess<00:01:21.000> I<00:01:21.180> was<00:01:21.299> little<00:01:21.570> little

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
10 but I guess I was little little

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:30.520 
10 but I guess I was little little
nervous<00:01:22.770> during<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.130> bench<00:01:23.340> time<00:01:23.549> so<00:01:23.820> I<00:01:24.180> got<00:01:29.509> I

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
nervous during the bench time so I got I

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.249 
nervous during the bench time so I got I
was<00:01:31.530> hearing<00:01:31.920> fifty<00:01:32.670> priority<00:01:33.030> free<00:01:33.180> agent
