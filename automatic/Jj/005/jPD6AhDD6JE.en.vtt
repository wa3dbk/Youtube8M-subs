00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 in songs like they are good because that 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.060
 I'll show you how to upload some clips 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.859
 to youtube or if you want to save it 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.679
 than a maximum of two minutes then 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.240
 good for you to know this is in case the 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.980
 they want to save or do what they want 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.750
 to make them is so they can record 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.150
 it's like to record them without having a 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.410
 capturing ok this also this is going 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.000
 to serve for the top five that I'm going to 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.619
 but, well, right now, I'll leave you the 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.060
 link out there on the screen so that 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.740
 go see that the top five for me 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.470
 give your games and all this relax but 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.390
 well let's see how to record this part 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.099
 I'm going to do it with zombies, let's go here 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.500
 where it says theater in you goes to 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:38.070
 go out cinema or theater that bullshit go away 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.750
 here then they will put you in choosing film 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.820
 or choose video ok 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.800
 then choose any video that 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.690
 you want to choose this one desvern 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.460
 that charge and good me once I load 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.840
 we go directly to the video that of 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.850
 this is where we are going to start choosing 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.890
 our clip with which we are going 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.199
 to hold save upload whatever 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.760
 then well let's wait then 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.559
 well once we 're in our 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.969
 game in which we want to record then 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.910
 just there in the bottom 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.400
 we see that it says x records or 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.940
 record ok the playstation is square 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.890
 so 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.080
 so they know this simply 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.760
 squeeze record is going to change as the 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.260
 screen and it's going to get like red 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.180
 as well as when you record with a camera 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.860
 with your phone like this in red blinking 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.630
 that you are going to record I tell you clip 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.920
 on record up to 2 minutes I will record 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.990
 I something a little bit so I do not accept 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.810
 everything is late both in rendering since 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.520
 just recorded my club I made my 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.200
 epic game then good we put you 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.270
 we can put a name or we can 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.980
 auto name to put the name alone 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.990
 this matter is not speaking as 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.330
 you want good already once 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.370
 we took it will start to save ok already 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.430
 once this video is saved we 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:43.830
 we grabbed and we left ok here it goes 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.360
 now that we let him out this says 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.480
 that we have not saved him we put him save 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.860
 edition we put you save there by 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.330
 example I had two guards because 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.070
 I was trying that rite how it worked 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.990
 we put you save let's wait for 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.810
 be saved and we already directly grab and 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.430
 we left the video ok ok good and a 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.770
 back here in theater mode 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.050
 cinema mode we are going to select 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.850
 movie ok or select video what 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.250
 we select and we go in the part of 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.500
 down where it says edith &amp; jones ok or 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.880
 edited videos edited movies we 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.920
 let's go to this part 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.780
 We obviously select equipment to have 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.730
 all the clips that we already keep 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.130
 previously ok then we grabbed 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.960
 we select our clip and it's going to 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.970
 start as to load already once 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.400
 be ready we are going to put you here where 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.830
 says render video or render video or 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.900
 that here says they can only 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.880
 render 2 minute videos then 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.620
 good is what I told them about what 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.090
 they record less than 2 minutes, not for not 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.100
 I gave them problems then good 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.740
 we wanted to render here he's going to tell me 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.600
 how many do I have how many lots or how many 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.010
 spaces I have for videos only 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.110
 I can have three at the same time 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.840
 then as if already climbed one because if 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.340
 they want not to burn themselves like their spaces 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.170
 Well, they delete it or something like that, not then 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.240
 well here we can put the title or 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.220
 the description or whatever and we put it 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.930
 save ok well and once we give it 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.550
 render will start loading the 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.280
 video and render what was going to 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.320
 start rendering to save to save 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.240
 all this part all this clip that 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.560
 we did then good 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.030
 it's just going to start like recording 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.860
 will see us how to start encouraging the 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.240
 image that is capturing all the 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.920
 frames and putting them together 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.330
 then good once you're ready 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.680
 the process takes a little bit depends 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.950
 how long your clip that's why they 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.629
 I say do not record much 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.220
 because it can take them a lot and it's a 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:23.230
 little boring to be watching but 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.330
 Now I put you how many as 12 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.920
 seconds and this is taking a 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.110
 little bit then good only you have to 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.060
 wait for this process to complete and 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.550
 good and once this is completed 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.690
 process will return us to the menu at 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.550
 start menu ok 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.450
 Ivan will come out to us like that sign that 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:42.160

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.769
 create it and you have to clean what you have 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.930
 to join or put that shit together with your 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:11.860

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.230
 do the account, he will send you 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:17.169
 directly and there is a giant button fucking 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.850
 which says link to your xbox account 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:20.380

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.170

 so celine that in these two accounts 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:30.220
 already once they are clean it takes a 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.440
 little bit depends on how many people 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.480
 I'm uploading things at the same time but 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.240
 it can take like 10 minutes can 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.580
 take an hour can be given two hours 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.770
 it's how very variable it depends on the traffic 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.660
 that there is but good once with this 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.790
