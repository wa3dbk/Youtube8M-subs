00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hello how about friends and welcome a 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:07.340
 more time to a new video to my channel then 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:10.320
 this time I bring you information about 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:12.090
 some codes since I have a tutorial 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.500
 of how to remove parental control already 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.650
 that happened to me and then 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:21.770
 I made a compilation of codes that I've 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.510
 found maybe you do not have it or 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.189
 I can not find it but I'm going 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.840
 to leave in the description of this video 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.420
 and I'm going to explain a bit in what 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.400
 it's because a lot of people are telling me 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.379
 is that your code does not help us danny des 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.030
 ok it's good for all consoles 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:37.370
 because because it depends on the number of 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.760
 series of your console some have a 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:43.820
 fat or slim console or prize and then 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.559
 everything depends on each code depends 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.480
 of each serial then they have not tested 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.190
 all 100% because I do not have the 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.260
 consoles to test each code 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.260
 then there are many who have left me in 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.000
 the description of this video or some 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.000
 that these codes will serve you 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.860
 please if you are served a code if I 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.200
 You can send in a private message if 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:06.229
 I have been able to help you by telling me the number 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.240
 serial no no no I just want to 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.850
 make a list and be able to help more 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.460
 people specifically if they tell me hey 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.229
 I have the serial number 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.390
 I send the code that such a person told me 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.979
 that worked for him then this would be 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.140
 a much faster process this is with 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.970
 the function of helping everyone 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.710
 some can not play their games 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.900
 favorites have blocking and things like that 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.210
 then that I will explain a little in 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.790
 what does this mean what they have to 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.530
 to do is that here it appears blocked 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.240
 for example to me in family before I 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.190
 it seemed that I had blocked here the 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.740
 parental control could not move anything 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.900
 because I had an account and things like that 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.030
 then what I talked to microsoft and 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.710
 what they gave me was a code then 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.540
 there are several codes I will teach 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.220
 some options and you will say where 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.680
 I put this good code in the code it 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.479
 puts in systems are going to the option of 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.820
 system and they go to the option of 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:58.090
 console settings are going to the 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.890
 option from bottom to bottom down that says 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:03.170
 system information once you're 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.119
 on this screen once you're in 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.759
 this screen the only thing that has to 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:09.979
 do not ask them enter a code no 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.769
 that's it does not ask them what they have to 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.230
 to do is to enter right there how the 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:17.000
 screen are going to be the function of the 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.739
 buttons or the code in the 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.690
 description will be a list of 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:23.239
 codes that you have sent me 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.280
 different people who have told you not 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:27.440
 this code worked for me and so 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.570
 then I am going to leave them 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.570
 if any code serves them send it 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:35.180
 send in a private message your serial 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:37.640
 of your console and the code they used 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.250
 so to say to know more or less in 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.350
 what kind of console does it serve? 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.390
 that code will be easier to help 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.970
 the others then in the description of 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:50.270
 video I will leave this all the codes 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:52.340
 and try to find out they are not many but they 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.550
 I will explain one that is very fast 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.190
 What is it 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.380
 press the guide button many times like this 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.330
 until you see an option to 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.790
 reset me will not appear because 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.740
 I have nothing blocked the guide button 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.630
 many times the other codes are the 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.090
 I will leave as I repeat in the description 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.850
 of this video once you are here in 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.100
 the screen that tells them to restart they go to 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.770
 can restart the console then 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:19.200
 many tell me hey hey give this one 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.880
 they lose my game is my everything not nothing 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.070
 information is lost the only thing that makes 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:27.000
 is that it prescribes the console reboots the 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:28.620
 Factory console as factory all 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.480
 What is the control? 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.610
 parent do not move anything or erase anything 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.160
 format hard drive nothing does not move anything 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.960
 it is simply the console that removes 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.900
 parental control and nothing else those 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.820
 they have chip I have not tried it but not 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.370
 nothing should happen since the chip does not 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:46.710
 has nothing to do just reboots 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.760
 until now all those who have 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:49.650
 I have been told that it has worked 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.450
 nothing and he told me hey, I erase the chito 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.310
 or something like that they have not had any problem 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.200
 so I want this to clarify 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.500
 so there are not many doubts and so 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.660
 can help more people and then nothing more 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.310
 I ask you to send me what I think here 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.050
 they sent me another code 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.900
 to see you have not sent it to me 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:10.569
 waiting for a few more codes then the 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.310
 I'll leave in the description of the video and 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:14.380
 so send a message if you 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.840
 serves or does not serve them and if they have any 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:19.269
 another question I can do another tutorial for 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.829
 so help them all and do not have the 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.690
 problem that they can not play is 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.490
 the game does not let them play online 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.440
 they can buy games like I did 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.930
 so I just ask you 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:32.350
 send this what kind of console do you 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:34.150
 served each code and try the 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.250
 most then work in those of 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.419
 bosch I hope it serves you and see you 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.200
 until next time 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:40.200
 my pretty people come out
