00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.160
 that 's the way you're doing so well now 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.350
 already a bit to the right 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.320
 shoulder to the left push right leg 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:13.230
 right and not once that was very good 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.580
 that was worried by the jump now 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.160
 Leave the rein long again 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:21.119
 Just be so without the pace too 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:24.090
 change is very nice wet 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.699
 the bit so better you can do that 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.650
 do not demonstrate 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:32.480
 So how are you doing this here no 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.480
 I'm a little too easy for myself 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:41.550
 prima so now it takes again the 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:44.309
 Brick on soya and always look like 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.590
 how good you are, you already have 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.899
 beautiful in front of you have yourself again 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.090
 eased somewhat and now you do not have 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.649
 time through the train 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.410
 and where it fits so again one 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:59.160
 change 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:03.420
 great and always nice to bit to 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.100
 enough is so good and now 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.890
 with the left thigh the right 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.409
 gallop left left and now great 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.900
 It is not so much better 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.909
 let's let the reins shoot like that 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.939
 yes let's just leave it for a while 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.860
 all a bit like a game 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:21.720
 Exactly and then you take the trains again 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.250
 shortly thereafter , she comes back to 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:28.409
 gathered gallop and changed 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.000
 again through the train and then rides 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.360
 sometimes a change from left to right 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.210
 right 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.820
 and exactly the same principle 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:39.960
 always with the right thigh the the 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:42.600
 prepare well as he did the change 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.350
 great in the neck stand so the right 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.700
 leg to it 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:51.030
 right right so and now super very 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:54.220
 good also okay let the trains again 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:59.950
 long on the circle 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:00.520
 so under par is thereby good for the step 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.330
 to care 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:06.210
 great so that makes it great 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.500
 it does not get any better 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.130
 that will make a very satisfied 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.310
 impression 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.440
 the horse stands the help that helps 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.250
 is processed nicely the field comes 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.260
 back the transitions the the 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:24.670
 work great there you can 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:27.459
 well then look again and again 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.410
 a little relaxation yes that's me 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.930
 important that you always ride 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.670
 again a little break in 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.000
 they also times a round on the long 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.490
 Reins ride and then you can if 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.980
 they did that then take that 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:45.060
 Reins up and then we go 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.060
 once again mentioned 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:59.590
 quiet so yes just so nice so great 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.330
 Now you come here again on the 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.890
 compasses 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.390
 almost a bit now 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.630
 try a bit more expressive 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.070
 ingredients more expressive even more so 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.760
 but not faster not fast 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.620
 to change 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.140
 you misunderstood that that 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.400
 tempo must be as evenly not keep 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.500
 change the tempo 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.390
 just the way of running easy 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.910
 hardworking he needs something legs 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:24.400
 move faster without passing faster 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.140
 to come together even more so 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:31.239
 still a tick diligent from behind 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:31.800
 came so nice so so beautiful before you 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:36.250
 hold 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:37.780
 It's great that way, and now you're leaving 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.480
 Once a long side especially 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.250
 shoulder in so and always on 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.890
 always stay nice from the back 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.450
 riding on the front of the bit without him 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.209
 Too fast values I may under the 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:54.459
 back away like to run ski in the corner 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:57.670
 purely riding so nice on the left soja 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:04:04.750
 that's great rhythm keeping rhythm like that 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:06.130
 and then you keep a traverse like that 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:10.870
 position in the corner a bit 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:14.799
 take along in the traverse soja very well 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:18.940
 so good on the left hand on the 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:21.270
 Circle and what I am right now 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:24.160
 I saw with you that you 

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:26.470
 in between hands on yes 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:30.130
 Do not do that, close your fingers 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:33.220
 keep your fist exactly like you see now 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:35.130
 do you have a reference she can still one 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:38.169
 Rise a little bit more 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:41.260
 looks the same and the hand but 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:42.280
 Suppress is just as nice as that 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.910
 great now go again 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:49.479
 shoulder in like that and trotted too much 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.889
 nice hard-working the whole trip goes through 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:55.569
 through the body 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:58.840
 very well so shoulder shoulder in that way 

00:04:55.569 --> 00:05:02.400
 left leg right moves yes and power 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:05.259
 not fingering is just fine 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:07.270
 because at the moment you put your hand on it 

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:10.029
 do you have another connection 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:12.999
 that's a better connection now 

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:14.129
 he can not go that much 

00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:17.169
 satisfied 

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:19.719
 just then you ride a traverse 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:24.629
 Ride left pretty deep into the corner 

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:24.629
 Left leg ran like that
