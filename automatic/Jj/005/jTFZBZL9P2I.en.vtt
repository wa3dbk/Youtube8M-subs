00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.540
 i also have and what is free 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.940
 and I will also explain them with words as always more critical 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.020
 I manage as posture I am tamento 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.430
 what I'm doing is trying to try as close as possible to the 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.510
 creation and possibly 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.510
 last the total has drawn more caracas 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.230
 so possibly part that one each plane tank 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.230
 if he has over them 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.030

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.990
 pons start us get ready 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.190
 then how to touch what is 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:14.159
 the outside 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.510
 the milestone of the song 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.510
 and open more meek and 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.640
 what I'm going to do musical events 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.880
 like an amulet and if you realize here what you are doing the two ways that 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.190
 I do not understand with 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:49.410
 with the end 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.410
 who touched him only with the blonde 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.330
 there also with the members of the famous 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.520
 i in this case what I am wishing it to fulfill kubrick and 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.280
 eta 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.880
 in this case because I have more friends 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.880
 it has to be all a bit of 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:23.170
 and it was with these decision you conformed demands more comfort the hair 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.170
 show how to play this bit slower 

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:55.889
 with these agreements you can be like this 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:20.510
 this case is that police and citizens want to do with their fingers or with some 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.429
 resource per month and what we're going to do right now esther how she plays what she is 

00:03:25.429 --> 00:03:27.399
 from his porch 

00:03:27.399 --> 00:03:31.939
 nbc meters we enter musac or rectify have something similar to this 

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:17.669
 finish 

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:24.190
 1 after seeing your alcohol eyes remember to have something similar to this 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.580
 nunn 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.300
 and then he remembered his past 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.300
 and I have had 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:45.360
 and after this we went to the first kiss oo 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.439
 if they are the ones that in the end attention is to repeat a stratum 1 and again 

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:52.439
 a cycle that cash out we want to finish the song 

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:54.199
 and destiny 

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:56.849
 well 

00:05:56.849 --> 00:06:00.740
 alter ego showing that he is the condemned because the leisure concession 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:36.380
 Well, with 13:30 today and as I always tell you, they are not going to gather 

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:39.380
 the parts of the house already agreed to correct that 

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:44.110
 play the song and for example if you show up to meet after the chorus 

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:47.400
 it adds part of the verse and that's how it was and as I say 

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.030
 after three colonies and 

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:50.619
 and it costs less we already have 

00:06:50.619 --> 00:06:54.359
 some subscribers put thousands of carriers subscribe use 

00:06:54.359 --> 00:06:57.319
 phones the videos have unofficial suggestions not out 

00:06:57.319 --> 00:07:01.009
 canal apple and your requests like this and reader like these 

00:07:01.969 --> 00:07:04.330
 Cuéllar and that path 

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.080
 type ecolatin costs less expensive 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.029
 which is almost always 

00:07:08.029 --> 00:07:11.369
 put an end with those we finalize olive structural is up to some 

00:07:11.369 --> 00:07:12.599
 stretches and do not practice
