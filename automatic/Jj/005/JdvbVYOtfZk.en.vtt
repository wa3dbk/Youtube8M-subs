go starting with the traction we have
traction<00:00:44.309> pods<00:00:44.640> with<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.059> herringbone<00:00:45.680> and

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
especially on a clean court it's super

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.860 
especially on a clean court it's super
sticky<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:53.789> so<00:00:54.629> you<00:00:55.289> really<00:00:55.800> like<00:00:56.309> you<00:00:56.489> really

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
sticky and so you really like you really

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.720 
sticky and so you really like you really
stick<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.050> court<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.559> it's<00:00:58.890> actually

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
stick to the court and it's actually

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.250 
stick to the court and it's actually
pretty<00:01:00.030> amazing<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.719> then<00:01:00.870> once<00:01:01.050> they<00:01:01.140> get

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
pretty amazing and then once they get

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.080 
pretty amazing and then once they get
kind<00:01:01.469> of<00:01:01.500> dirty<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:02.370> got<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.579> wipe<00:01:02.760> them<00:01:02.910> off

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:05.090 
kind of dirty you got to wipe them off

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.060 
kind of dirty you got to wipe them off
traction<00:01:06.090> pods<00:01:06.270> really<00:01:06.630> save<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.680> whole<00:01:07.830> shoe

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
traction pods really save the whole shoe

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.219 
traction pods really save the whole shoe
because<00:01:08.250> if<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.549> was<00:01:08.670> just<00:01:08.880> full<00:01:09.390> clear<00:01:10.760> it<00:01:11.760> be

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
because if it was just full clear it be

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:14.690 
because if it was just full clear it be
not<00:01:13.229> as<00:01:13.500> good<00:01:13.770> so<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.130> believe<00:01:14.400> have<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.549> give

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
not as good so I believe have to give

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.630 
not as good so I believe have to give
these<00:01:14.850> probably<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.360> 7<00:01:15.920> the<00:01:16.920> traction<00:01:17.340> probably

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
these probably a 7 the traction probably

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.210 
these probably a 7 the traction probably
07<00:01:18.000> because<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.720> know<00:01:18.869> I<00:01:19.110> mean<00:01:19.500> I<00:01:19.560> had<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.070> keep

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
07 because you know I mean I had to keep

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.280 
07 because you know I mean I had to keep
wiping<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:20.820> usually<00:01:21.540> off<00:01:21.659> together<00:01:21.840> any<00:01:22.170> of

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
wiping and usually off together any of

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.760 
wiping and usually off together any of
my<00:01:22.409> other<00:01:22.470> shoes<00:01:22.880> on<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.090> midsole<00:01:24.560> as<00:01:25.560> you

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.870 
wasn't stiff it was just easy to come
through<00:02:02.310> so<00:02:02.940> I'm<00:02:03.150> gonna<00:02:03.270> say<00:02:03.479> this<00:02:03.509> is<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:03.810> 8.5

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
through so I'm gonna say this is a 8.5

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:12.410 
through so I'm gonna say this is a 8.5
out<00:02:05.880> of<00:02:05.940> 10<00:02:09.200> materials<00:02:10.200> a<00:02:10.610> great<00:02:11.610> material<00:02:12.120> so

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
out of 10 materials a great material so

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.240 
out of 10 materials a great material so
I'll<00:02:13.080> have<00:02:13.170> to<00:02:13.230> get<00:02:13.350> that<00:02:13.470> at<00:02:13.620> nine<00:02:13.830> point<00:02:14.100> five

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
I'll have to get that at nine point five

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.410 
I'll have to get that at nine point five
out<00:02:14.489> of<00:02:14.520> 10<00:02:14.790> on<00:02:15.530> their<00:02:16.530> ability<00:02:17.180> i'm<00:02:18.180> going<00:02:18.360> to

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
out of 10 on their ability i'm going to

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.280 
out of 10 on their ability i'm going to
say<00:02:18.480> nine<00:02:18.720> point<00:02:18.900> five<00:02:19.020> out<00:02:19.140> of<00:02:19.230> ten<00:02:21.200> since<00:02:22.200> i

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
say nine point five out of ten since i

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.360 
say nine point five out of ten since i
have<00:02:22.410> wide<00:02:22.620> feet<00:02:22.650> I<00:02:23.840> didn't<00:02:24.840> have<00:02:24.959> to<00:02:25.370> awesome

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
have wide feet I didn't have to awesome

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.220 
have wide feet I didn't have to awesome
thing<00:02:26.519> about<00:02:26.550> this<00:02:26.790> I<00:02:26.970> did<00:02:27.090> not<00:02:27.239> have<00:02:27.540> to<00:02:27.720> go<00:02:27.870> up

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
thing about this I did not have to go up

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.470 
thing about this I did not have to go up
a<00:02:28.260> half<00:02:28.470> size<00:02:28.769> which<00:02:29.489> I'm<00:02:29.640> so<00:02:29.880> glad<00:02:30.120> that<00:02:30.390> I

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
a half size which I'm so glad that I

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.160 
a half size which I'm so glad that I
didn't<00:02:31.910> since<00:02:32.910> I<00:02:33.030> knew<00:02:33.239> this<00:02:33.360> is<00:02:33.540> know<00:02:33.810> whether

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
didn't since I knew this is know whether

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.370 
didn't since I knew this is know whether
patent<00:02:34.620> leather<00:02:34.769> it<00:02:35.280> was<00:02:35.430> gonna<00:02:35.840> kind<00:02:36.840> of<00:02:36.959> you

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
patent leather it was gonna kind of you

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.720 
patent leather it was gonna kind of you
know<00:02:38.569> fan<00:02:39.569> out<00:02:39.600> you<00:02:40.319> know<00:02:40.440> if<00:02:41.280> it's<00:02:41.430> leather

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
know fan out you know if it's leather

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.370 
know fan out you know if it's leather
it's<00:02:41.970> going<00:02:42.120> to<00:02:42.180> loosen<00:02:42.630> up<00:02:42.840> very<00:02:43.050> easily<00:02:43.140> and

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
it's going to loosen up very easily and

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.960 
it's going to loosen up very easily and
it<00:02:43.560> did<00:02:43.769> it<00:02:44.040> did<00:02:44.100> um<00:02:44.959> but<00:02:45.959> really<00:02:46.319> I<00:02:46.970> didn't

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
it did it did um but really I didn't

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.370 
it did it did um but really I didn't
have<00:02:48.090> any<00:02:48.269> hot<00:02:48.450> spots<00:02:48.600> and<00:02:48.870> it<00:02:49.019> had<00:02:49.110> nothing

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
have any hot spots and it had nothing

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.520 
have any hot spots and it had nothing
like<00:02:49.470> that<00:02:50.810> durability<00:02:51.810> is<00:02:52.140> great

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
like that durability is great

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:58.850 
like that durability is great
breathability<00:02:53.390> got<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:54.480> cord<00:02:54.720> or<00:02:54.810> mesh<00:02:57.860> that

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
breathability got the cord or mesh that

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.789 
breathability got the cord or mesh that
actually<00:02:59.190> worked<00:02:59.340> pretty<00:02:59.489> well<00:02:59.910> I<00:03:00.650> for<00:03:01.650> me<00:03:01.769> I

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
actually worked pretty well I for me I

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:05.060 
actually worked pretty well I for me I
really<00:03:01.980> don't<00:03:02.220> care<00:03:02.280> about<00:03:04.070> breathability

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
really don't care about breathability

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.640 
really don't care about breathability
doesn't<00:03:05.880> really<00:03:06.000> matter<00:03:06.150> to<00:03:06.299> me<00:03:06.500> because<00:03:07.500> I

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
doesn't really matter to me because I

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.349 
doesn't really matter to me because I
usually<00:03:07.920> were<00:03:08.040> two<00:03:08.579> or<00:03:08.700> three<00:03:08.850> prison<00:03:09.120> socks

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:09.359 
usually were two or three prison socks

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:12.349 
usually were two or three prison socks
anyways<00:03:09.989> so<00:03:10.500> it<00:03:11.220> does<00:03:11.519> not<00:03:11.549> matter<00:03:11.970> to<00:03:12.150> me

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:12.359 
anyways so it does not matter to me

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:14.750 
anyways so it does not matter to me
anyways<00:03:13.320> I<00:03:13.560> have<00:03:14.070> to<00:03:14.130> get<00:03:14.280> breather<00:03:14.489> do<00:03:14.640> it

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
anyways I have to get breather do it

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:15.860 
anyways I have to get breather do it
because<00:03:14.910> I<00:03:14.970> really<00:03:15.120> didn't<00:03:15.329> feel<00:03:15.420> it<00:03:15.480> anyways

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
because I really didn't feel it anyways

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.000 
because I really didn't feel it anyways
so<00:03:16.370> durable<00:03:17.989> breathability<00:03:18.989> would<00:03:19.739> have<00:03:19.890> to

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
so durable breathability would have to

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.440 
so durable breathability would have to
be<00:03:20.130> a<00:03:20.720> six<00:03:21.720> because<00:03:22.440> I<00:03:22.620> really<00:03:22.829> didn't<00:03:23.010> feel<00:03:23.130> it

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
be a six because I really didn't feel it

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.180 
be a six because I really didn't feel it
