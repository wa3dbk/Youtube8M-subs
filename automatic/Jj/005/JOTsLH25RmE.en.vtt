00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
gonna show you in our routine using

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.020 
gonna show you in our routine using
dumbbells<00:00:12.360> that<00:00:12.990> shifts<00:00:13.799> the<00:00:14.280> angle<00:00:14.849> with

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
dumbbells that shifts the angle with

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.120 
dumbbells that shifts the angle with
which<00:00:15.059> we're<00:00:15.570> stressing<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.470> muscles<00:00:16.830> of<00:00:17.070> the

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
which we're stressing the muscles of the

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.720 
which we're stressing the muscles of the
arms<00:00:18.090> near<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.570> biceps<00:00:19.020> and<00:00:19.109> triceps<00:00:19.199> and<00:00:19.920> how

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
arms near the biceps and triceps and how

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.320 
arms near the biceps and triceps and how
that<00:00:21.150> will<00:00:21.449> actually<00:00:21.689> force<00:00:22.470> more<00:00:23.340> growth<00:00:23.939> in

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
that will actually force more growth in

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.830 
that will actually force more growth in
both<00:00:25.289> of<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:26.400> muscles<00:00:26.760> now<00:00:27.090> why<00:00:27.390> is<00:00:27.449> that<00:00:27.630> the

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
both of the muscles now why is that the

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:28.429 
both of the muscles now why is that the
case

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
case

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.769 
case
very<00:00:29.010> simple<00:00:29.550> think<00:00:30.090> of<00:00:30.179> it<00:00:30.269> like<00:00:30.359> this<00:00:30.599> from

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
very simple think of it like this from

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.780 
very simple think of it like this from
now<00:00:30.840> on<00:00:31.230> whenever<00:00:31.529> it<00:00:31.830> is<00:00:31.920> you're<00:00:32.219> approaching

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
now on whenever it is you're approaching

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.810 
now on whenever it is you're approaching
on<00:00:32.969> building<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.930> program<00:00:34.380> for<00:00:34.680> growth<00:00:35.040> your

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
on building a program for growth your

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.020 
on building a program for growth your
body<00:00:36.239> reacts<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.440> adapts<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.550> demands

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
body reacts and adapts to the demands

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.700 
body reacts and adapts to the demands
that<00:00:39.180> you've<00:00:39.390> placed<00:00:39.690> upon<00:00:40.050> it<00:00:40.079> so<00:00:40.230> if<00:00:40.530> you

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
that you've placed upon it so if you

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.209 
that you've placed upon it so if you
throw<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.340> new<00:00:41.820> arm<00:00:42.239> routine<00:00:43.020> in<00:00:43.230> or<00:00:43.440> chesterton

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
throw a new arm routine in or chesterton

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.180 
throw a new arm routine in or chesterton
or<00:00:44.309> whatever<00:00:44.760> it<00:00:44.879> is<00:00:44.969> that<00:00:45.030> you're<00:00:45.390> doing

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
or whatever it is that you're doing

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.470 
or whatever it is that you're doing
initially<00:00:47.190> your<00:00:47.489> body<00:00:47.789> is<00:00:48.000> going<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.360> be

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
initially your body is going to be

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.319 
initially your body is going to be
shocked<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.440> will<00:00:49.649> adapt<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.160> it<00:00:50.670> by

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
shocked and it will adapt to it by

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.170 
shocked and it will adapt to it by
building<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:52.260> muscle<00:00:52.710> necessary<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.940> meet

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
building the muscle necessary to meet

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.810 
building the muscle necessary to meet
the<00:00:54.360> demands<00:00:55.079> that<00:00:55.260> that<00:00:55.890> new<00:00:56.100> stress<00:00:56.550> is

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
the demands that that new stress is

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.700 
the demands that that new stress is
placing<00:00:57.300> upon<00:00:57.570> it<00:00:57.690> so<00:00:57.780> if<00:00:57.930> you<00:00:58.050> continue<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.620> do

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
placing upon it so if you continue to do

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.500 
placing upon it so if you continue to do
the<00:00:58.800> same<00:00:59.010> things<00:00:59.219> over<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.489> over<00:00:59.609> again<00:00:59.820> it's

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
the same things over and over again it's

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.060 
the same things over and over again it's
not<00:01:00.780> going<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.109> have<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.350> same<00:01:01.590> effect<00:01:01.980> so

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
not going to have the same effect so

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.189 
not going to have the same effect so
from<00:01:02.460> now<00:01:02.609> on<00:01:02.940> I<00:01:03.120> want<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.870> think<00:01:04.049> about

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
from now on I want you to think about

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.859 
from now on I want you to think about
throwing<00:01:04.619> in<00:01:04.890> different<00:01:05.430> wrinkles<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.630> your

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
throwing in different wrinkles to your

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.590 
throwing in different wrinkles to your
training<00:01:07.470> in<00:01:07.619> order<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.070> force<00:01:08.640> more<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.510> the

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
training in order to force more of the

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.960 
training in order to force more of the
growth<00:01:09.869> that<00:01:10.080> you're<00:01:10.500> looking<00:01:10.770> for<00:01:11.070> check<00:01:11.790> out

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
notice is that that little shift that's

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.740 
notice is that that little shift that's
going<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:40.020> force<00:01:40.470> more<00:01:41.400> growth<00:01:41.880> is<00:01:42.210> something

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
going to force more growth is something

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.069 
going to force more growth is something
as<00:01:42.930> simple<00:01:43.229> as<00:01:43.490> changing<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:45.119> angle<00:01:45.329> with

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
as simple as changing the angle with

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.170 
as simple as changing the angle with
which<00:01:46.110> you're<00:01:46.500> doing<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.799> exercise<00:01:47.280> so<00:01:47.579> wrap

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
which you're doing the exercise so wrap

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.969 
which you're doing the exercise so wrap
the<00:01:48.390> bat<00:01:48.540> right<00:01:48.810> here<00:01:49.200> you're<00:01:49.380> gonna<00:01:49.530> notice

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
the bat right here you're gonna notice

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.069 
the bat right here you're gonna notice
that<00:01:50.189> during<00:01:50.790> those<00:01:51.060> skull<00:01:51.390> crushers<00:01:51.869> I'm

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
that during those skull crushers I'm

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.190 
that during those skull crushers I'm
doing<00:01:52.560> an<00:01:52.680> incline<00:01:53.250> instead<00:01:53.790> of<00:01:53.970> just<00:01:54.930> laying

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
doing an incline instead of just laying

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.889 
doing an incline instead of just laying
down<00:01:55.350> doing<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:56.159> regular<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:56.880> it<00:01:57.299> doesn't<00:01:57.689> seem

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
down doing a regular and it doesn't seem

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.080 
down doing a regular and it doesn't seem
like<00:01:58.079> much<00:01:58.290> it<00:01:58.500> really<00:01:58.770> doesn't<00:01:59.219> but<00:01:59.790> what
