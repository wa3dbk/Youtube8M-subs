00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:08.040
 how about friends now let's fine-tune a 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:12.059
 Volkswagen is given 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:14.610
 this is a volkswagen is a taxi that's why 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.010
 they see it a little bit has moped by like this for 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.250
 that you see that this is real, 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.920
 we are going to name the components that 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.649
 you have this vehicle in case you do not remember 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.099
 do not remember that the third one is going to 

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:31.290
 do in the Volkswagen sedan as it goes 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.940
 the computer remember here is the 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.880
 Air temperature sensor 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:40.530
 entry of multiple admission more to the 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:43.560
 right we have the butterfly sensor 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.450
 of acceleration down here we have the 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.910
 dealer here is where is the 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.800
 speed sensor or position of the 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.550
 crankshaft going inside that is an effect 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.590
 with we have our coil here behind the 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.640
 filter is the regulating valve of 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:02.750
 minimum gear and a little back 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:06.620
 here we have empty in 2 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.670
 one is stop are three hoses one goes 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.740
 directly 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.320
 well in good gas tank towards the 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.670
 valve of the gas evaporator system 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.340
 of the fuel tank that is the 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.899
 thick we have here a thin girl who is 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.159
 the white one the white one in which the 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:22.140
 regulator that is for back of the 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.390
 turbine and the green one is the one that goes 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.930
 directly to the computer because there 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.479
 inside is the sensor map mc without sensor 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.090
 of absolute pressure and multiple admission 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.000
 to the left below we have the 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:39.119
 Engine temperature sensor here 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.880
 towards the sides we have the injectors 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:45.259
 are 2 remember that this injection is 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.850
 sequential that means forgiveness is 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:50.009
 simultaneous forgiveness is simultaneous is 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.440
 nothing of simultaneous sequential 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:55.619
 Four injectors open at the same time 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:58.550
 if here on the side you usually carry a 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.710
 stopper are reached to see 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.410
 this is where we are going to check the pressure 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:06.230
 of the fuel pump and meter 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:09.950
 our liquid lava director is true 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:12.290
 yes then if we open the socket and open 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.230
 our coil that is here above the 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.090
 right side 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.040
 we have the sensor connector 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.440
 oxygen in this case is three wires 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.860
 Newest of four keys is the only 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:27.240
 difference from the first to the last 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:30.210
 who did come back yes 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.980
 right friends we need 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.690
 Remember the former will inhabit the 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.480
 tool then we need 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.240
 disconnect the fuel pump like this 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.180
 that goes down the fuel tank and 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.460
 we have to disconnect for us to put 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.500
 pressure over here let's show the 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.580
 tools that we need to be able to 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.580
 refine our vehicle
