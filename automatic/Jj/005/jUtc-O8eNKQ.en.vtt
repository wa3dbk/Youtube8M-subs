and in this video I'm basically going to

show you how to get him and basically

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.499 
show you how to get him and basically
how<00:00:12.660> good<00:00:12.900> he<00:00:13.139> is<00:00:13.170> um<00:00:13.519> he<00:00:14.519> has<00:00:14.610> two<00:00:14.910> attacks

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
how good he is um he has two attacks

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.689 
how good he is um he has two attacks
he's<00:00:15.780> a<00:00:15.809> melee<00:00:16.260> champion<00:00:16.830> so<00:00:17.070> I<00:00:17.100> think<00:00:17.310> it's<00:00:17.580> a

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
he's a melee champion so I think it's a

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.029 
he's a melee champion so I think it's a
heal<00:00:18.300> hero<00:00:18.750> it's<00:00:19.080> a<00:00:19.140> melee<00:00:19.470> hero<00:00:19.770> not<00:00:20.010> a

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
heal hero it's a melee hero not a

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.300 
heal hero it's a melee hero not a
champion<00:00:20.310> I<00:00:20.699> think<00:00:21.359> it's<00:00:21.539> um<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:22.650> only<00:00:23.070> one

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
champion I think it's um the only one

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.849 
champion I think it's um the only one
that's<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.939> melee<00:00:24.269> one<00:00:24.510> I'm<00:00:25.230> pretty<00:00:25.439> sure<00:00:25.710> it

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
that's the melee one I'm pretty sure it

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.380 
that's the melee one I'm pretty sure it
has<00:00:25.890> two<00:00:26.130> attacks<00:00:26.220> Thunder<00:00:26.730> in<00:00:26.820> a<00:00:26.880> jungle<00:00:27.150> and

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
has two attacks Thunder in a jungle and

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.300 
has two attacks Thunder in a jungle and
if<00:00:28.019> there<00:00:28.140> is<00:00:28.230> grenade<00:00:28.590> that<00:00:28.740> deals<00:00:28.949> damage

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
if there is grenade that deals damage

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.519 
if there is grenade that deals damage
within<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:29.880> radius<00:00:30.029> um<00:00:30.510> when<00:00:31.050> taking<00:00:31.380> damage

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
within a radius um when taking damage

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.799 
within a radius um when taking damage
and<00:00:31.920> block<00:00:32.160> which<00:00:33.090> is<00:00:33.300> pretty<00:00:33.450> much<00:00:33.600> like<00:00:33.750> a

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
and block which is pretty much like a

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.860 
and block which is pretty much like a
shield<00:00:34.140> which<00:00:34.530> it's<00:00:34.860> pretty<00:00:35.040> awesome<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.870> he

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.450 
shield which it's pretty awesome and he
doesn't<00:00:37.200> do<00:00:37.290> too<00:00:37.469> much<00:00:37.500> damage<00:00:37.950> but<00:00:38.129> he<00:00:38.340> is

there's big a lot of traps um I'm just
basically<00:01:04.890> finding<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.700> easiest<00:01:06.119> space<00:01:06.360> I

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
basically finding the easiest space I

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.330 
basically finding the easiest space I
could<00:01:06.630> find<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.170> this<00:01:07.229> one's<00:01:07.470> pretty<00:01:07.650> pretty

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
could find and this one's pretty pretty

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.609 
could find and this one's pretty pretty
easy<00:01:08.580> it<00:01:09.299> was<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.630> first<00:01:09.840> one<00:01:09.990> I<00:01:10.020> found<00:01:10.320> so<00:01:10.590> I

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
easy it was the first one I found so I

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:11.539 
easy it was the first one I found so I
figured<00:01:11.159> why<00:01:11.310> not

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
figured why not

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.630 
figured why not
it<00:01:11.729> looks<00:01:11.970> pretty<00:01:12.119> easy<00:01:12.470> so<00:01:13.470> this<00:01:14.040> is<00:01:14.250> tornado

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
it looks pretty easy so this is tornado

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.359 
it looks pretty easy so this is tornado
basically<00:01:15.500> yeah<00:01:16.500> I<00:01:16.530> don't<00:01:16.920> think<00:01:17.189> you<00:01:17.250> can

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
basically yeah I don't think you can

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.310 
basically yeah I don't think you can
hear<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.610> sound<00:01:17.880> but<00:01:18.240> he<00:01:18.270> is<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.540> melee<00:01:18.869> champion

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
and when he does take down and she

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.030 
and when he does take down and she
throws<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.630> grenade<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.259> shield<00:01:22.530> there<00:01:22.950> it

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
throws a grenade and the shield there it

abilities are pretty cool I gotta say

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.160 
abilities are pretty cool I gotta say
they<00:01:41.310> do<00:01:41.640> look<00:01:41.820> pretty<00:01:42.090> nice<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.570> he<00:01:42.840> being

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
they do look pretty nice and he being

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.170 
they do look pretty nice and he being
that<00:01:43.350> he's<00:01:43.530> only<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:44.100> only<00:01:44.250> melee<00:01:44.670> champion

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
that he's only the only melee champion

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.690 
that he's only the only melee champion
it's<00:01:46.020> kind<00:01:46.320> of<00:01:46.409> cool<00:01:46.590> as<00:01:46.740> well<00:01:46.920> because<00:01:47.340> he's

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
it's kind of cool as well because he's

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.660 
it's kind of cool as well because he's
like<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.619> slasher<00:01:49.619> basically<00:01:50.130> but<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.340> jacked

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
like a slasher basically but a jacked

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.010 
like a slasher basically but a jacked
slasher<00:01:51.270> he's<00:01:51.540> he's<00:01:51.990> massive<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:52.880> I<00:01:53.899> did<00:01:54.899> get

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
slasher he's he's massive and I did get

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.660 
slasher he's he's massive and I did get
him<00:01:55.140> yesterday<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.740> I<00:01:55.920> did<00:01:56.070> upgrade<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.490> once

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
him yesterday and I did upgrade and once

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.270 
him yesterday and I did upgrade and once
so<00:01:57.509> he<00:01:57.840> is<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.200> little<00:01:58.649> better<00:01:58.829> than<00:01:58.950> he<00:01:59.159> is

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
so he is a little better than he is

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.399 
so he is a little better than he is
normally<00:01:59.759> and<00:01:59.939> that<00:02:00.689> there<00:02:00.869> was<00:02:00.960> his<00:02:01.110> grenade

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
normally and that there was his grenade

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.160 
normally and that there was his grenade
he<00:02:01.649> just<00:02:01.860> threw<00:02:02.100> it<00:02:02.280> he<00:02:03.240> took<00:02:03.479> some<00:02:03.780> damage<00:02:03.930> so

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
he just threw it he took some damage so

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.740 
he just threw it he took some damage so
he<00:02:04.439> could<00:02:04.770> be<00:02:04.920> tossed<00:02:05.189> it<00:02:05.430> at<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.880> death<00:02:06.509> drone

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
he could be tossed it at the death drone

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.930 
he could be tossed it at the death drone
tossed<00:02:07.409> another<00:02:07.740> one<00:02:07.920> I<00:02:08.099> hope<00:02:08.369> he<00:02:08.520> saw<00:02:08.700> that

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
tossed another one I hope he saw that

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.570 
tossed another one I hope he saw that
it's<00:02:09.629> lagging<00:02:10.319> on<00:02:10.379> my<00:02:10.500> computer<00:02:10.860> so<00:02:11.520> he

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
it's lagging on my computer so he

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.800 
it's lagging on my computer so he
probably<00:02:11.819> didn't<00:02:12.239> see<00:02:12.390> it<00:02:12.510> but

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
probably didn't see it but

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.360 
probably didn't see it but
probably<00:02:14.170> take<00:02:14.410> a<00:02:14.440> lot<00:02:14.680> to<00:02:14.890> see<00:02:15.010> that<00:02:15.040> and

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
probably take a lot to see that and

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.330 
probably take a lot to see that and
we're<00:02:15.520> there<00:02:15.910> we<00:02:16.060> go<00:02:16.420> so<00:02:16.599> tornado<00:02:17.230> he's<00:02:18.130> got

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
we're there we go so tornado he's got

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.790 
we're there we go so tornado he's got
two<00:02:18.640> abilities<00:02:19.150> I<00:02:19.840> obviously<00:02:20.170> said<00:02:20.500> that<00:02:20.680> like

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
two abilities I obviously said that like

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.830 
two abilities I obviously said that like
30<00:02:21.130> times<00:02:21.340> already<00:02:21.670> but<00:02:21.970> they're<00:02:22.630> decent

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
30 times already but they're decent

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.530 
30 times already but they're decent
abilities<00:02:23.410> um<00:02:23.770> they<00:02:24.670> do<00:02:24.849> a<00:02:24.880> good<00:02:25.239> amount<00:02:25.450> of

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
abilities um they do a good amount of

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.720 
abilities um they do a good amount of
damage<00:02:25.720> and<00:02:26.230> let's<00:02:27.130> see<00:02:27.280> if<00:02:27.370> we<00:02:27.459> can<00:02:27.580> break

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
damage and let's see if we can break

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.160 
damage and let's see if we can break
this<00:02:27.849> wall<00:02:28.030> so<00:02:28.209> if<00:02:28.270> tornado<00:02:28.599> can<00:02:28.810> go<00:02:28.900> back<00:02:29.050> to

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
this wall so if tornado can go back to

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.650 
this wall so if tornado can go back to
work

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
work

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.210 
work
he<00:02:31.660> has<00:02:31.780> block<00:02:32.050> and<00:02:32.319> the<00:02:32.530> throw<00:02:32.769> the<00:02:32.920> grenade

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
he has block and the throw the grenade

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.390 
he has block and the throw the grenade
which<00:02:34.180> I<00:02:34.360> think<00:02:34.750> the<00:02:34.930> grenade<00:02:35.290> does<00:02:35.650> the<00:02:36.190> same

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
which I think the grenade does the same

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.130 
which I think the grenade does the same
amount<00:02:36.640> of<00:02:36.670> damage<00:02:36.880> he<00:02:37.300> does<00:02:37.510> but<00:02:37.780> I'm<00:02:37.870> not<00:02:38.019> too

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
amount of damage he does but I'm not too

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.960 
amount of damage he does but I'm not too
sure<00:02:38.290> about<00:02:38.349> that<00:02:38.680> but<00:02:39.459> it<00:02:39.610> would<00:02:39.730> be<00:02:39.849> pretty

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
sure about that but it would be pretty

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.089 
sure about that but it would be pretty
awesome<00:02:40.209> if<00:02:40.480> he<00:02:40.569> does<00:02:40.720> and<00:02:41.080> hopefully<00:02:41.950> we<00:02:42.069> can

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 
awesome if he does and hopefully we can

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:45.270 
awesome if he does and hopefully we can
break<00:02:42.340> this<00:02:42.459> wall<00:02:42.640> nope<00:02:43.680> they<00:02:44.680> chose<00:02:45.010> not<00:02:45.130> to

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
break this wall nope they chose not to

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.910 
break this wall nope they chose not to
go<00:02:45.519> for<00:02:45.730> the<00:02:45.790> weak<00:02:45.940> one<00:02:46.150> but<00:02:46.600> now<00:02:47.530> tornado

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
go for the weak one but now tornado

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.350 
go for the weak one but now tornado
finally<00:02:48.340> broke<00:02:48.549> through<00:02:48.790> but<00:02:48.970> he<00:02:49.030> didn't<00:02:49.239> want

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
finally broke through but he didn't want

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.120 
finally broke through but he didn't want
to<00:02:49.450> go<00:02:49.510> this<00:02:49.660> way<00:02:49.720> so<00:02:49.930> he's<00:02:50.200> gonna<00:02:50.350> be<00:02:50.890> stuck

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
to go this way so he's gonna be stuck

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.590 
to go this way so he's gonna be stuck
here<00:02:51.340> for<00:02:51.549> the<00:02:51.640> pretty<00:02:52.030> much<00:02:52.150> the<00:02:52.269> rest<00:02:52.420> of<00:02:52.540> the

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
here for the pretty much the rest of the

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.630 
here for the pretty much the rest of the
battle<00:02:52.840> so<00:02:53.739> I'm<00:02:53.799> gonna<00:02:53.890> put<00:02:54.100> alligator<00:02:54.489> in

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
battle so I'm gonna put alligator in

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:55.860 
battle so I'm gonna put alligator in
there<00:02:54.760> so<00:02:54.940> we<00:02:55.030> could<00:02:55.150> possibly<00:02:55.299> get<00:02:55.630> some

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
there so we could possibly get some

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.320 
there so we could possibly get some
golden<00:02:56.500> oil<00:02:56.739> I'll<00:02:57.100> be<00:02:57.280> awesome<00:02:57.790> we<00:02:57.940> got<00:02:58.060> some

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
golden oil I'll be awesome we got some

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.660 
golden oil I'll be awesome we got some
gold<00:02:58.690> I<00:02:59.019> think<00:02:59.410> we<00:02:59.680> started<00:02:59.950> off<00:03:00.069> with<00:03:00.220> 100

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
gold I think we started off with 100

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.180 
gold I think we started off with 100
feet<00:03:01.019> 200,000<00:03:02.019> and<00:03:02.110> yeah<00:03:02.290> safety<00:03:02.860> I<00:03:02.950> think

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
feet 200,000 and yeah safety I think

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.479 
feet 200,000 and yeah safety I think
probably<00:03:03.790> a<00:03:03.940> lot<00:03:04.090> more<00:03:04.120> than<00:03:04.390> that<00:03:04.569> but<00:03:05.489> all

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
probably a lot more than that but all

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:10.050 
probably a lot more than that but all
the<00:03:06.670> Gunners<00:03:06.940> are<00:03:07.180> dead<00:03:07.450> um<00:03:07.840> I<00:03:08.819> just<00:03:09.819> have<00:03:09.910> some

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
damage obviously that's how its

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.479

implemented<00:03:59.109> in<00:03:59.380> the<00:03:59.440> game<00:03:59.819> but<00:04:00.819> he<00:04:01.540> is<00:04:02.100> decent

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:06.449 
implemented in the game but he is decent
he's<00:04:03.760> a<00:04:03.790> melee<00:04:04.120> try<00:04:04.329> to<00:04:04.389> be<00:04:04.510> a<00:04:04.540> hero<00:04:05.319> Wow<00:04:05.950> he's<00:04:06.430> a

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
he's a melee try to be a hero Wow he's a

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:07.949 
he's a melee try to be a hero Wow he's a
melee<00:04:06.790> hero<00:04:07.060> so<00:04:07.329> it<00:04:07.420> does<00:04:07.510> take<00:04:07.690> a<00:04:07.720> lot<00:04:07.900> more

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
melee hero so it does take a lot more

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:11.729 
melee hero so it does take a lot more
damage<00:04:08.260> but<00:04:09.250> um<00:04:09.549> I<00:04:09.940> do<00:04:10.180> think<00:04:10.630> he<00:04:11.260> has<00:04:11.470> a<00:04:11.500> good

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
damage but um I do think he has a good

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:13.920 
damage but um I do think he has a good
amount<00:04:11.950> of<00:04:12.130> health<00:04:12.340> so<00:04:12.790> we<00:04:12.910> can<00:04:13.120> sustain<00:04:13.600> on

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
amount of health so we can sustain on

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.890 
amount of health so we can sustain on
that<00:04:14.160> 650<00:04:15.160> health<00:04:15.370> and<00:04:15.579> 57<00:04:16.090> damage<00:04:16.359> per<00:04:16.479> second

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
that 650 health and 57 damage per second

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.400 
that 650 health and 57 damage per second
it's<00:04:17.829> not<00:04:18.039> not<00:04:18.579> two<00:04:18.729> yet<00:04:18.940> but<00:04:19.209> I<00:04:19.419> think

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
it's not not two yet but I think

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.310 
it's not not two yet but I think
bulldozer<00:04:21.039> is<00:04:21.280> like<00:04:21.459> 200<00:04:22.450> health<00:04:22.599> barely<00:04:23.050> and

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
bulldozer is like 200 health barely and

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.040 
bulldozer is like 200 health barely and
then<00:04:24.220> I<00:04:24.400> think<00:04:24.760> the<00:04:25.150> strongest<00:04:25.659> want<00:04:25.870> to<00:04:25.930> have

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
then I think the strongest want to have

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.610 
then I think the strongest want to have
is<00:04:26.169> bone<00:04:26.380> crusher<00:04:26.860> who<00:04:27.070> has

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:06.790 
then once I do that it counts as one and
you<00:05:04.699> need<00:05:05.090> 20<00:05:05.479> of<00:05:05.570> those<00:05:05.690> and<00:05:05.960> you<00:05:06.410> can't<00:05:06.650> use

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
you need 20 of those and you can't use

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.770 
you need 20 of those and you can't use
the<00:05:06.949> same<00:05:07.130> person<00:05:07.490> twice<00:05:07.610> you<00:05:08.360> have<00:05:08.389> to<00:05:08.660> use

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780 
the same person twice you have to use

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.990 
the same person twice you have to use
all<00:05:09.020> different<00:05:09.199> people<00:05:09.710> because<00:05:09.830> it's<00:05:10.190> only

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
all different people because it's only

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.360 
all different people because it's only
it<00:05:11.120> only<00:05:11.300> counts<00:05:11.539> once<00:05:11.960> and<00:05:12.229> I<00:05:12.860> can't<00:05:13.130> do<00:05:13.250> it

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
it only counts once and I can't do it

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:14.740 
it only counts once and I can't do it
right<00:05:13.460> here<00:05:13.639> but<00:05:13.760> there's<00:05:13.940> an<00:05:14.060> invite<00:05:14.389> button

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
through the game and it's really fast it

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:25.060 
through the game and it's really fast it
goes<00:05:23.990> right<00:05:24.199> to<00:05:24.260> their<00:05:24.500> account<00:05:24.800> obviously

goes right to their account obviously

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.969 
goes right to their account obviously
and<00:05:25.669> once<00:05:26.479> they<00:05:26.630> click<00:05:26.870> that<00:05:27.080> you<00:05:27.650> just<00:05:27.830> have

to restart your game and then start it

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:31.690 
to restart your game and then start it
back<00:05:29.690> up<00:05:29.900> and<00:05:30.080> it<00:05:30.440> should<00:05:30.650> count<00:05:30.830> and<00:05:31.100> if<00:05:31.580> it

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:31.700 
back up and it should count and if it

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.010 
back up and it should count and if it
doesn't<00:05:31.910> you<00:05:32.150> got<00:05:32.300> to<00:05:32.419> wait<00:05:32.539> a<00:05:32.570> little<00:05:32.780> bit

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:33.020 
doesn't you got to wait a little bit

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.050 
doesn't you got to wait a little bit
I've<00:05:33.500> had<00:05:33.710> somewhere<00:05:34.070> I<00:05:34.099> had<00:05:34.220> to<00:05:34.310> wait<00:05:34.430> like<00:05:34.610> 15

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.060 
I've had somewhere I had to wait like 15

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:36.460 
I've had somewhere I had to wait like 15
minutes<00:05:35.270> but<00:05:35.479> that's<00:05:35.720> pretty<00:05:35.930> much<00:05:36.080> it<00:05:36.260> and

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:36.470 
minutes but that's pretty much it and

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:38.800 
minutes but that's pretty much it and
then<00:05:37.130> after<00:05:37.460> that<00:05:37.580> you<00:05:37.729> do<00:05:37.849> get<00:05:38.030> 50<00:05:38.360> diamonds

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:38.810 
then after that you do get 50 diamonds

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:42.029 
then after that you do get 50 diamonds
and<00:05:38.990> you<00:05:39.110> do<00:05:39.229> get<00:05:39.410> a<00:05:39.440> nice<00:05:39.680> hero<00:05:40.419> tornado<00:05:41.419> and

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:42.039 
and you do get a nice hero tornado and

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:44.860 
and you do get a nice hero tornado and
I'm<00:05:43.039> pretty<00:05:43.340> sure<00:05:43.550> everyone<00:05:43.880> has<00:05:44.120> it<00:05:44.330> by<00:05:44.450> now<00:05:44.630> I

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:44.870 
I'm pretty sure everyone has it by now I

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:46.300 
I'm pretty sure everyone has it by now I
know<00:05:45.050> there's<00:05:45.229> some<00:05:45.740> people<00:05:45.830> that<00:05:46.010> don't<00:05:46.250> have

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:46.310 
know there's some people that don't have

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:49.390 
know there's some people that don't have
it<00:05:46.520> but<00:05:47.470> I've<00:05:48.470> been<00:05:48.530> attacked<00:05:48.919> by<00:05:49.190> a<00:05:49.220> couple

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:49.400 
it but I've been attacked by a couple

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.159 
it but I've been attacked by a couple
people<00:05:49.639> with<00:05:49.849> tornado<00:05:50.270> and<00:05:50.539> I'm<00:05:50.720> using<00:05:50.930> the

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:51.169 
people with tornado and I'm using the

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:54.550 
people with tornado and I'm using the
couple<00:05:51.410> pass<00:05:51.560> attacks<00:05:51.950> so<00:05:52.990> I'm<00:05:53.990> gonna<00:05:54.260> find

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:54.560 
couple pass attacks so I'm gonna find

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.129 
couple pass attacks so I'm gonna find
another<00:05:54.650> one<00:05:55.190> more<00:05:55.400> attack<00:05:55.760> that<00:05:56.630> I<00:05:56.660> got<00:05:56.960> a

00:05:57.129 --> 00:05:57.139 
another one more attack that I got a

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:00.129 
another one more attack that I got a
good<00:05:57.349> amount<00:05:57.560> of<00:05:57.740> gold<00:05:58.010> and<00:05:58.250> oil<00:05:58.340> and<00:05:59.060> I<00:05:59.960> use

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:00.139 
good amount of gold and oil and I use

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:01.900 
good amount of gold and oil and I use
tornado<00:06:00.650> I<00:06:00.740> know<00:06:01.039> there's<00:06:01.250> a<00:06:01.340> couple<00:06:01.520> I<00:06:01.669> didn't

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:01.910 
tornado I know there's a couple I didn't

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:04.950 
tornado I know there's a couple I didn't
use<00:06:02.030> tornado<00:06:02.479> so<00:06:02.840> this<00:06:03.620> one<00:06:03.800> looks<00:06:03.979> perfect

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:04.960 
use tornado so this one looks perfect

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.140 
use tornado so this one looks perfect
286,000<00:06:05.960> goal<00:06:06.080> and<00:06:06.380> i<00:06:07.099> get<00:06:07.220> amount<00:06:07.430> of<00:06:07.580> oil<00:06:07.789> and

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:08.150 
286,000 goal and i get amount of oil and

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.120 
286,000 goal and i get amount of oil and
we're<00:06:08.750> gonna<00:06:08.900> see<00:06:09.139> what<00:06:09.289> tornado<00:06:09.710> can<00:06:09.979> do

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:10.130 
we're gonna see what tornado can do

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:12.640 
we're gonna see what tornado can do
hopefully<00:06:10.630> times<00:06:11.630> to<00:06:11.810> speed<00:06:12.080> doesn't<00:06:12.260> mind<00:06:12.500> my

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:12.650 
hopefully times to speed doesn't mind my

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:14.350 
hopefully times to speed doesn't mind my
computer<00:06:13.039> too<00:06:13.160> much<00:06:13.310> now<00:06:13.849> this<00:06:14.000> space<00:06:14.150> is

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:14.360 
computer too much now this space is

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.870 
computer too much now this space is
pretty<00:06:14.479> easy<00:06:15.130> there<00:06:16.130> probably<00:06:16.490> would<00:06:16.699> be<00:06:16.849> a

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:16.880 
pretty easy there probably would be a

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.400 
pretty easy there probably would be a
lot<00:06:17.090> of<00:06:17.180> traps<00:06:17.389> in<00:06:17.599> there<00:06:17.720> but<00:06:17.900> he<00:06:18.110> is<00:06:18.199> a<00:06:18.229> low

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:18.410 
lot of traps in there but he is a low

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:20.339 
lot of traps in there but he is a low
level<00:06:18.590> so<00:06:19.250> it<00:06:19.340> doesn't<00:06:19.550> have<00:06:19.639> those<00:06:19.789> traps

00:06:20.339 --> 00:06:20.349 
level so it doesn't have those traps

00:06:20.349 --> 00:06:22.990 
level so it doesn't have those traps
did<00:06:21.349> I<00:06:21.410> use<00:06:21.560> tornado<00:06:21.979> and<00:06:22.280> I<00:06:22.310> can't<00:06:22.520> see<00:06:22.699> it<00:06:22.849> I'm

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:23.000 
did I use tornado and I can't see it I'm

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.339 
did I use tornado and I can't see it I'm
lagging<00:06:23.180> too<00:06:23.449> much<00:06:23.599> I'm<00:06:23.750> gonna<00:06:23.840> put<00:06:24.050> us<00:06:24.139> back

00:06:24.339 --> 00:06:24.349 
lagging too much I'm gonna put us back

00:06:24.349 --> 00:06:26.800 
lagging too much I'm gonna put us back
to<00:06:24.470> one<00:06:24.680> and<00:06:24.979> it's<00:06:25.880> still<00:06:26.150> gonna<00:06:26.419> lag<00:06:26.630> a<00:06:26.660> little

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:26.810 
to one and it's still gonna lag a little

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:28.779 
to one and it's still gonna lag a little
I<00:06:27.199> think<00:06:27.260> us<00:06:27.560> yeah<00:06:28.099> there<00:06:28.370> he<00:06:28.460> is

00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:28.789 
I think us yeah there he is

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:31.150 
I think us yeah there he is
so<00:06:29.449> he<00:06:29.539> does<00:06:29.720> die<00:06:29.930> pretty<00:06:30.169> fast<00:06:30.500> this<00:06:30.800> martyr

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:31.160 
so he does die pretty fast this martyr

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:35.379 
so he does die pretty fast this martyr
is<00:06:31.280> powerful<00:06:32.150> but<00:06:33.310> he<00:06:34.310> did<00:06:34.460> take<00:06:34.699> that<00:06:34.970> out<00:06:35.180> and

00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:35.389 
is powerful but he did take that out and

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:37.630 
is powerful but he did take that out and
he<00:06:35.990> I<00:06:36.200> don't<00:06:36.409> even<00:06:36.680> think<00:06:36.860> he<00:06:37.070> got<00:06:37.219> to<00:06:37.340> use<00:06:37.460> his

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:37.640 
he I don't even think he got to use his

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.899 
he I don't even think he got to use his
abilities<00:06:37.960> which<00:06:38.960> is<00:06:39.140> kind<00:06:39.740> of<00:06:39.800> sad<00:06:40.039> but<00:06:40.550> he

00:06:40.899 --> 00:06:40.909 
abilities which is kind of sad but he

00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:41.290 
abilities which is kind of sad but he
did
