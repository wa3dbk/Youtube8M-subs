different<00:02:42.960> names<00:02:43.320> to<00:02:43.440> use<00:02:43.680> for<00:02:43.890> the<00:02:43.980> car<00:02:44.160> we

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
different names to use for the car we

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.010 
different names to use for the car we
were<00:02:44.760> trying<00:02:45.030> to<00:02:45.180> avoid<00:02:45.450> other<00:02:45.630> names<00:02:45.900> that

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
were trying to avoid other names that

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.170 
were trying to avoid other names that
we're<00:02:46.200> already<00:02:46.410> being<00:02:46.620> used<00:02:46.740> yeah<00:02:47.460> and<00:02:47.490> then

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
we're already being used yeah and then

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.550 
we're already being used yeah and then
we<00:02:48.300> thought<00:02:48.450> well<00:02:48.630> you<00:02:48.750> know<00:02:48.780> why<00:02:49.380> don't<00:02:49.500> we

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
we thought well you know why don't we

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.190 
we thought well you know why don't we
look<00:02:49.680> at<00:02:49.770> some<00:02:49.940> Masonic<00:02:50.940> symbology<00:02:51.480> and<00:02:51.660> see

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
look at some Masonic symbology and see

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.510 
look at some Masonic symbology and see
what<00:02:52.320> else<00:02:52.470> they've<00:02:52.680> used<00:02:52.920> since<00:02:53.130> we're<00:02:53.280> using

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
what else they've used since we're using

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.270 
what else they've used since we're using
Illuminati<00:02:54.240> anyway<00:02:54.690> and<00:02:54.900> 7<00:02:55.680> kept<00:02:55.890> coming<00:02:56.160> up

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
Illuminati anyway and 7 kept coming up

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.980 
Illuminati anyway and 7 kept coming up
on<00:02:56.400> a<00:02:56.430> lot<00:02:56.610> of<00:02:56.640> those<00:02:56.820> symbology<00:02:57.360> then<00:02:57.900> we

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
on a lot of those symbology then we

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.420 
on a lot of those symbology then we
start<00:02:58.230> looking<00:02:58.350> at<00:02:58.560> other<00:02:58.740> car<00:02:59.010> names<00:02:59.220> out

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
start looking at other car names out

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:00.620 
start looking at other car names out
there<00:02:59.460> and<00:02:59.730> there<00:02:59.820> were<00:02:59.880> some<00:03:00.030> old<00:03:00.180> Morgan

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
there and there were some old Morgan

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.170 
there and there were some old Morgan
life<00:03:00.810> moving<00:03:01.140> cars<00:03:01.410> that<00:03:01.710> use<00:03:01.890> the<00:03:02.400> name<00:03:02.700> 7

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
life moving cars that use the name 7

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.580 
life moving cars that use the name 7
back<00:03:03.360> in<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:03.600> 30s<00:03:03.960> which<00:03:04.170> was<00:03:04.320> kind<00:03:04.500> of

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
back in the 30s which was kind of

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.900 
back in the 30s which was kind of
stylistically<00:03:05.460> what<00:03:05.700> we<00:03:05.850> were<00:03:05.910> looking<00:03:06.240> for

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
stylistically what we were looking for

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.220 
stylistically what we were looking for
tell<00:03:08.910> me<00:03:09.000> a<00:03:09.030> little<00:03:09.180> bit<00:03:09.300> about<00:03:09.570> the<00:03:09.900> looks<00:03:10.110> of

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
tell me a little bit about the looks of

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.330 
tell me a little bit about the looks of
the<00:03:10.320> car<00:03:10.500> because<00:03:10.800> the<00:03:10.920> first<00:03:11.130> thing<00:03:11.250> you

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
the car because the first thing you

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.830 
the car because the first thing you
notice<00:03:11.610> when<00:03:11.640> you<00:03:11.790> walk<00:03:12.000> in<00:03:12.180> the<00:03:12.240> boys<00:03:12.450> this

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
notice when you walk in the boys this

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.870 
notice when you walk in the boys this
car<00:03:13.140> is<00:03:13.350> like<00:03:13.560> this<00:03:13.770> neo-noir

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
car is like this neo-noir

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.750 
car is like this neo-noir
almost<00:03:15.660> Sin<00:03:16.080> City<00:03:16.440> style<00:03:16.830> looking<00:03:17.280> car<00:03:17.520> I<00:03:17.550> mean

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
almost Sin City style looking car I mean

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.250 
almost Sin City style looking car I mean
it<00:03:17.880> looks<00:03:18.030> incredibly<00:03:18.420> what<00:03:18.810> was<00:03:18.960> the<00:03:19.080> thought

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
it looks incredibly what was the thought

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.960 
it looks incredibly what was the thought
process<00:03:19.320> behind<00:03:19.710> that<00:03:20.070> we<00:03:20.550> went<00:03:20.730> for

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
process behind that we went for

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.690 
process behind that we went for
drivetrain<00:03:21.660> and<00:03:21.870> aerodynamics<00:03:22.700> the

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
drivetrain and aerodynamics the

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.510 
drivetrain and aerodynamics the
drivetrain<00:03:24.180> is<00:03:24.540> an<00:03:25.200> AC<00:03:25.530> electric<00:03:26.280> motor

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
drivetrain is an AC electric motor

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.370 
drivetrain is an AC electric motor
liquid<00:03:27.180> cooled<00:03:27.420> it's<00:03:27.660> the<00:03:27.780> most<00:03:27.930> efficient

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
liquid cooled it's the most efficient

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.990 
liquid cooled it's the most efficient
one<00:03:28.470> we<00:03:28.620> could<00:03:28.770> find<00:03:28.800> once<00:03:29.400> we<00:03:29.550> have<00:03:29.670> the<00:03:29.760> drive

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
one we could find once we have the drive

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.910 
one we could find once we have the drive
trained<00:03:30.390> settled<00:03:30.960> it<00:03:31.230> was<00:03:31.410> then<00:03:31.590> the<00:03:31.740> body

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
trained settled it was then the body

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.740 
trained settled it was then the body
work<00:03:32.160> how<00:03:32.820> do<00:03:32.880> you<00:03:33.030> make<00:03:33.210> the<00:03:33.390> body<00:03:33.570> as

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
work how do you make the body as

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.810 
work how do you make the body as
aerodynamic<00:03:34.080> as<00:03:34.560> possible<00:03:35.100> so<00:03:35.250> it<00:03:35.370> meets<00:03:35.550> all

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
aerodynamic as possible so it meets all

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.580 
aerodynamic as possible so it meets all
the<00:03:36.000> requirements<00:03:36.150> of<00:03:36.690> the<00:03:36.780> competition<00:03:37.380> and

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
the requirements of the competition and

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.130 
the requirements of the competition and
so<00:03:37.860> it<00:03:37.950> looks<00:03:38.160> cool<00:03:38.370> we<00:03:38.970> wanted<00:03:39.300> to<00:03:39.480> get<00:03:39.900> some

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
so it looks cool we wanted to get some

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.750 
so it looks cool we wanted to get some
retro<00:03:40.470> styling<00:03:40.770> into<00:03:41.220> it<00:03:41.340> the<00:03:41.580> most

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
retro styling into it the most

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.550 
retro styling into it the most
aerodynamic<00:03:42.000> shape<00:03:42.510> is<00:03:42.660> a<00:03:42.990> teardrop

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
aerodynamic shape is a teardrop

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.780 
aerodynamic shape is a teardrop
rounded<00:03:44.010> on<00:03:44.100> one<00:03:44.280> end<00:03:44.430> then<00:03:44.550> it<00:03:44.640> has<00:03:44.760> a

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
rounded on one end then it has a

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.910 
rounded on one end then it has a
tapering<00:03:45.360> tail<00:03:45.660> as<00:03:45.810> as<00:03:45.990> the<00:03:46.170> water<00:03:46.470> droplet

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
tapering tail as as the water droplet

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.010 
tapering tail as as the water droplet
walls<00:03:47.130> do<00:03:47.520> we<00:03:47.610> looked<00:03:47.790> at<00:03:47.910> the<00:03:48.030> 1930s<00:03:48.810> and<00:03:48.960> 40s

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 
walls do we looked at the 1930s and 40s

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.380 
walls do we looked at the 1930s and 40s
vehicles<00:03:49.830> and<00:03:50.070> then<00:03:50.190> why<00:03:50.610> those<00:03:50.880> cars<00:03:51.210> are

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
vehicles and then why those cars are

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:52.820 
vehicles and then why those cars are
being<00:03:51.570> made<00:03:51.750> rounded<00:03:52.260> what<00:03:52.410> one<00:03:52.590> it<00:03:52.710> was<00:03:52.800> a

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
being made rounded what one it was a

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.860 
being made rounded what one it was a
style<00:03:53.130> mostly<00:03:53.910> they<00:03:54.090> did<00:03:54.270> it<00:03:54.420> because<00:03:54.510> now

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
style mostly they did it because now

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:04.760 
style mostly they did it because now
it's<00:03:55.050> more<00:03:55.200> aerodynamic<00:04:03.350> always<00:04:04.350> love<00:04:04.590> going

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.770 
it's more aerodynamic always love going

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:06.950 
it's more aerodynamic always love going
door<00:04:05.220> so<00:04:05.460> from<00:04:05.700> the<00:04:05.820> get-go<00:04:06.000> we<00:04:06.480> wanted<00:04:06.810> them

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:06.960 
door so from the get-go we wanted them

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.610 
door so from the get-go we wanted them
and<00:04:07.530> we<00:04:07.710> kept<00:04:08.840> well<00:04:09.840> it's<00:04:10.110> really<00:04:10.350> hard<00:04:10.530> to

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
and we kept well it's really hard to

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:11.690 
and we kept well it's really hard to
make<00:04:10.770> them<00:04:10.920> and<00:04:11.070> how<00:04:11.130> do<00:04:11.220> you<00:04:11.310> make<00:04:11.430> the<00:04:11.550> door

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
make them and how do you make the door

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.780 
make them and how do you make the door
seals<00:04:12.060> with<00:04:12.330> in<00:04:12.780> the<00:04:12.990> end<00:04:13.170> it<00:04:13.800> was<00:04:14.070> just<00:04:14.340> easier

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
seals with in the end it was just easier

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.610 
seals with in the end it was just easier
to<00:04:14.910> get<00:04:15.030> in<00:04:15.210> and<00:04:15.360> out<00:04:15.450> of<00:04:15.600> the<00:04:15.690> car<00:04:15.900> let's<00:04:16.410> talk

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
to get in and out of the car let's talk

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.560 
to get in and out of the car let's talk
about<00:04:16.710> you<00:04:17.370> and<00:04:17.549> the<00:04:17.610> team<00:04:17.970> for<00:04:18.150> instance<00:04:18.450> a

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
about you and the team for instance a

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.750 
about you and the team for instance a
car<00:04:18.930> like<00:04:19.200> the<00:04:19.350> 7<00:04:19.710> there's<00:04:20.040> no<00:04:20.130> manual<00:04:20.730> for

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
car like the 7 there's no manual for

that there's nothing that says oh this

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:23.300 
that there's nothing that says oh this

is where you start and this is where you

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.800 
is where you start and this is where you
get<00:04:23.430> to<00:04:23.640> I<00:04:23.670> mean<00:04:23.880> you<00:04:24.000> guys<00:04:24.150> it's<00:04:24.630> been<00:04:24.720> a

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
get to I mean you guys it's been a

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.240 
get to I mean you guys it's been a
constant<00:04:25.320> learning<00:04:25.470> curve<00:04:25.830> for<00:04:25.860> you<00:04:26.040> hasn't

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
constant learning curve for you hasn't

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.540 
constant learning curve for you hasn't
it

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
it

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.360 
it
I<00:04:26.580> think<00:04:26.880> anyone<00:04:27.150> can<00:04:27.360> do<00:04:27.540> this<00:04:27.570> if<00:04:28.380> they're

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
I think anyone can do this if they're

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.030 
I think anyone can do this if they're
willing<00:04:29.760> to<00:04:29.790> spend<00:04:30.690> the<00:04:30.930> time<00:04:31.110> and<00:04:31.350> it's<00:04:31.740> taken

steering that yes four-wheel steering

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:07.770 
steering that yes four-wheel steering
you<00:05:06.250> borrowed<00:05:06.640> that<00:05:06.760> from<00:05:06.820> a<00:05:07.090> Honda<00:05:07.390> Prelude

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:07.780 
you borrowed that from a Honda Prelude

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:08.690 
you borrowed that from a Honda Prelude
Wow

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:08.700 
Wow

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.590 
Wow
steering<00:05:09.750> just<00:05:10.750> noticing<00:05:11.290> does<00:05:11.470> that<00:05:11.590> kind<00:05:12.340> of

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600 
steering just noticing does that kind of

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.330 
steering just noticing does that kind of
drift<00:05:13.600> a<00:05:13.810> little<00:05:13.840> bit<00:05:14.080> is<00:05:14.290> that<00:05:14.320> the<00:05:14.710> when<00:05:15.250> you

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
drift a little bit is that the when you

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.250 
drift a little bit is that the when you
initially<00:05:15.880> turn<00:05:16.090> the<00:05:16.270> steering<00:05:16.510> wheel<00:05:16.780> so<00:05:17.080> it

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:17.260 
initially turn the steering wheel so it

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.770 
initially turn the steering wheel so it
works<00:05:17.620> at<00:05:17.800> high<00:05:18.010> and<00:05:18.190> low<00:05:18.310> speeds<00:05:18.790> room<00:05:19.540> wheels

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:19.780 
works at high and low speeds room wheels

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.280 
works at high and low speeds room wheels
turn<00:05:20.110> the<00:05:20.200> same<00:05:20.530> direction<00:05:20.800> is<00:05:21.130> the<00:05:21.250> puppy

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:22.290 
turn the same direction is the puppy

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:26.100 
turn the same direction is the puppy
almost<00:05:23.290> doing<00:05:23.470> a<00:05:23.590> mediator<00:05:24.400> drift<00:05:25.110> it's

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
almost doing a mediator drift it's

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:30.870 
almost doing a mediator drift it's
actually<00:05:29.010> so<00:05:30.010> we<00:05:30.190> had<00:05:30.340> to<00:05:30.430> have<00:05:30.520> a<00:05:30.550> steering

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 
actually so we had to have a steering

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.720 
actually so we had to have a steering
radius<00:05:31.180> of<00:05:31.300> a<00:05:31.360> small<00:05:31.660> car<00:05:32.050> so<00:05:32.620> we<00:05:33.040> adapted<00:05:33.340> the

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:33.730 
radius of a small car so we adapted the

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:35.970 
radius of a small car so we adapted the
the<00:05:34.210> Honda<00:05:34.450> Prelude<00:05:34.780> to<00:05:34.960> it<00:05:35.110> speaking<00:05:35.440> of<00:05:35.740> that

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:35.980 
the Honda Prelude to it speaking of that

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:38.400 
the Honda Prelude to it speaking of that
I<00:05:36.010> mean<00:05:36.130> this<00:05:36.490> isn't<00:05:36.670> you<00:05:37.270> know<00:05:37.510> all<00:05:37.840> original

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:38.410 
I mean this isn't you know all original

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:40.050 
I mean this isn't you know all original
car<00:05:38.650> but<00:05:38.830> it's<00:05:38.950> also<00:05:39.070> a<00:05:39.280> little<00:05:39.490> bit<00:05:39.640> of<00:05:39.730> a<00:05:39.850> mutt

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:40.060 
car but it's also a little bit of a mutt

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.330 
car but it's also a little bit of a mutt
isn't<00:05:40.390> it<00:05:40.480> because<00:05:40.600> you've<00:05:40.930> taken<00:05:41.470> bits<00:05:42.100> and

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:42.340 
isn't it because you've taken bits and

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.640 
isn't it because you've taken bits and
pieces<00:05:42.580> from<00:05:43.030> existing<00:05:43.660> cars<00:05:43.930> and<00:05:44.350> sort<00:05:44.620> of

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650 
pieces from existing cars and sort of

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.710 
pieces from existing cars and sort of
mash<00:05:45.010> them<00:05:45.250> all<00:05:45.310> together<00:05:45.520> the<00:05:46.060> suspension<00:05:46.630> on

mash them all together the suspension on
