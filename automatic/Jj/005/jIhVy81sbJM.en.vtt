00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:14.639
 People I'm here to do a touch. 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.190
 special and show you 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.529
 what are the essential products that 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.180
 I use a lot on this station and I do not 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.519
 get out of my bag of my bathroom 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.140
 anyway things that I really like that I 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.029
 I used to suck, I thought it was cool 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.949
 share with you I'll start 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.689
 with a tip 100 super clichÃ© but I 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.329
 I think it's very worthwhile that it's a 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.899
 thermal water I chose from that rock 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.149
 but it may be from bich avenue and piano 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.160
 beyond any henry 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.290
 because they all have this effect is 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.059
 moisturizer on the skin they are super 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.780
 then you can apply 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.969
 I did makeup so you can 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.340
 pass thermal water over makeup 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.829
 Can you get on the beach and then? 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.340
 the solar industry and beyond cool 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.719
 It matters this function in the summer you 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.270
 Can also apply after make-up 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.939
 to leave is and but at the end that 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.130
 beautiful body of summer dispersion dava 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.100
 and he does not speak until Mars knows he is 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.180
 Nice also to park in these 7 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.040
 beach in the bag 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.950
 also left on his own dressing table. 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.630
 where is it to happen here fresh and well 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.220
 pretty good, another thing that I have to 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.070
 show you are two of the factors 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.009
 I use a lot is the first of this 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.360
 Bible that is the bronze project this is a 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.250
 factor 30 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.720
 I like to apply here on my lap in 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.490
 belly on the back 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.890
 I like to apply factor 15 in the 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.869
 legs because it really protects 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.700
 bronze it leaves a beautiful thing but 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.250
 do not let money or red know 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.470
 they also have a very good smell 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.270
 in that style of sunscreen know the 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.909
 smell kind of get very cool money 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.210
 and he has protection the deer and a baby and 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.740
 Do not stay on the market. 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.000
 is that you will feel something in the 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.670
 skin more 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.490
 sticky curious abit I really like 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.170
 of him and another that I discovered this year 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.540
 it was this one that is natural 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.900
 photo-balancing is also a factor 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.570
 protection of uvb rays and 10 for 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.940
 UV rays to it a protective gel around 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.610
 of a cool texture, yes, it tastes good 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.650
 fresh and here it says that it reflects and is 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.750
 antioxidant in addition it is resistant 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.360
 water and sweat so I liked it a lot 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.850
 to use my father you see is more 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.260
 or less here and I'll take her to 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.150
 Infinity pool Anywhere I 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.550
 I'm going to expose myself to the sun, I like to apply 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.760
 also in these areas and it's really cool 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:35.250
 Another thing that I think is a lot of 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.680
 You ended up forgetting to protect 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.230
 your lips because I do not even care 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.420
 very lip protection I'll stay there sun 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.640
 When marketing even I do doctor 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.980
 sun on his face passed in his arms in the 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.959
 body but the sides ended up leaving 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.590
 on the side only this year found 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:54.780
 davene product that is this is everything 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.700
 written in French so I'll leave 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.880
 close enough for you to see that the 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:04.080
 context sunscreen too high 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.940
 tension so it is in stick format and O 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.799
 you can apply on the lips and 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.110
 any area without a child you can 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:11.160
 apply on scars and can apply 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.170
 tattoo 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.450
 You can apply a sun stain 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.250
 I told the mother only here on the forehead and here 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.170
 in this area of search or step and thus 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.790
 all sin even because it goes 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.730
 protect and has the sun protection factor 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.860
 50 so it 's super high super good and no 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.780
 pretend it also equally sticky 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.329
 despite being in acoustic format like this 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.010
 it is absorbed and becomes more relaxed 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:34.260
 Even for you, you have to apply makeup. 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.079
 then I'll do it when I expose myself 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.660
 in the sun or something I leave and 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:41.430
 Then I'll do the makeup over in that area. 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.070
 That's so no problem here. 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.750
 also said that sensitive skin is 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.310
 very resistant to water, then the 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.450
 tip for me tattoo I think this 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.160
 french fries 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.799
 It was one thing I've been using a lot 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.560
 Much is bath time, and I do not 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.750
 have used 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.700
 active in the summer because we do not 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.230
 I could not use it myself enough. 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.450
 I'm sweating now we're dying. 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.890
 heat and I wonder pass 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.260
 moisturizer after a while the skin 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.239
 it is all wet because it can not 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:10.300
 treat you can not absorb then 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:11.860
 I abolish body moisturizers now 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.690
 in summer they are using only the line of 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.069
 bath and I'm running liking 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.530
 enough is one I've already talked about 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:20.320
 several times it 's the one here natura ekos 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:22.090
 I already went out and I really like him a lot 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.760
 I do in the bath he says he has dry touch 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.320
 and is true in the growing market 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.450

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.250
 to be slipping, you know, it's really cool 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.889
