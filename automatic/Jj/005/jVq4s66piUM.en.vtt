00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
Wrestlemania but Bray Wyatt basically

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.049 
Wrestlemania but Bray Wyatt basically
just<00:00:40.860> called<00:00:41.129> out<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.399> Undertaker<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:41.969> he

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
just called out the Undertaker and he

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.639 
just called out the Undertaker and he
never<00:00:42.180> really<00:00:42.540> responded<00:00:43.110> till<00:00:43.320> you<00:00:43.530> know<00:00:43.559> a

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
never really responded till you know a

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.580 
never really responded till you know a
week<00:00:43.980> or<00:00:44.250> two<00:00:45.030> weeks<00:00:45.239> before<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:46.469> actual

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
week or two weeks before the actual

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.250 
week or two weeks before the actual
pay-per-view<00:00:47.340> so<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:48.239> reason<00:00:48.539> why<00:00:48.870> I

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
pay-per-view so the reason why I

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.830 
pay-per-view so the reason why I
actually<00:00:49.829> didn't<00:00:50.370> make<00:00:50.670> this<00:00:50.820> video<00:00:51.030> earlier

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
actually didn't make this video earlier

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.959 
actually didn't make this video earlier
is<00:00:52.020> because<00:00:52.289> I<00:00:52.469> thought<00:00:52.739> that<00:00:52.920> something<00:00:53.160> was

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
is because I thought that something was

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.160 
is because I thought that something was
gonna<00:00:54.120> happen<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.449> Wrestlemania<00:00:54.899> because<00:00:55.050> we

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
gonna happen to Wrestlemania because we

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.569 
gonna happen to Wrestlemania because we
never<00:00:55.289> really<00:00:55.590> saw<00:00:55.800> Undertaker<00:00:56.039> before

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
never really saw Undertaker before

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.310 
never really saw Undertaker before
WrestleMania<00:00:57.059> so<00:00:57.210> I<00:00:57.239> thought<00:00:57.449> I<00:00:57.510> for<00:00:58.170> some

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
WrestleMania so I thought I for some

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.810 
WrestleMania so I thought I for some
reason<00:00:58.350> there's<00:00:58.739> gonna<00:00:58.829> be<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.039> controversy

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
reason there's gonna be a controversy

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.310 
reason there's gonna be a controversy
and<00:00:59.969> he<00:01:00.059> wasn't<00:01:00.359> going<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.539> show<00:01:00.690> up<00:01:00.930> something

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
and he wasn't going to show up something

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.020 
and he wasn't going to show up something
like<00:01:01.350> that<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:01.710> thought<00:01:01.980> that<00:01:02.160> in<00:01:02.640> my<00:01:02.820> mind

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
like that I thought that in my mind

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.340 
like that I thought that in my mind
something<00:01:03.480> big<00:01:03.719> like<00:01:03.870> that<00:01:04.080> was<00:01:04.170> gonna<00:01:04.229> happen

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
something big like that was gonna happen

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.260 
something big like that was gonna happen
I<00:01:04.860> was<00:01:05.189> surprised<00:01:05.519> that<00:01:05.640> he<00:01:05.729> showed<00:01:05.970> up<00:01:06.119> I<00:01:06.240> was
