00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
does bother me sometimes the fact that I

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.819 
does bother me sometimes the fact that I
wish<00:00:59.250> I<00:00:59.430> could<00:00:59.789> trim<00:01:00.230> trim<00:01:01.230> though<00:01:01.379> I<00:01:01.649> mean

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
because there's some negative stuff on

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.320 
because there's some negative stuff on
whatever<00:01:04.260> you<00:01:04.530> want<00:01:04.680> play<00:01:04.890> but<00:01:05.189> come<00:01:05.790> need<00:01:06.060> one

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
whatever you want play but come need one

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.649 
whatever you want play but come need one
I<00:01:06.630> can<00:01:07.110> it's<00:01:08.010> just<00:01:08.070> I<00:01:08.490> die<00:01:08.850> but<00:01:09.119> there's<00:01:09.510> a<00:01:09.540> lot

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
I can it's just I die but there's a lot

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.080 
I can it's just I die but there's a lot
of<00:01:09.720> stuff<00:01:09.930> I<00:01:10.080> play<00:01:10.290> as<00:01:10.409> well<00:01:10.590> does<00:01:11.010> but<00:01:11.250> it

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
of stuff I play as well does but it

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.609 
of stuff I play as well does but it
doesn't<00:01:12.270> make<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.570> nice<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:12.750> easy<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.200> string

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
doesn't make it nice and easy to string

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.499 
doesn't make it nice and easy to string
because<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.159> other<00:01:14.310> owners<00:01:14.729> I've<00:01:14.880> got<00:01:15.030> just

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
because the other owners I've got just

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.810 
because the other owners I've got just
that<00:01:16.110> can<00:01:16.409> be<00:01:16.590> really<00:01:16.860> annoying<00:01:17.100> linking

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
that can be really annoying linking

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.289 
that can be really annoying linking
strings<00:01:18.210> so<00:01:18.860> yeah<00:01:19.860> I<00:01:19.890> mean<00:01:20.070> look<00:01:20.700> at<00:01:20.909> I<00:01:20.970> mean

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
strings so yeah I mean look at I mean

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.480 
strings so yeah I mean look at I mean
there's<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.170> thing<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.530> don't<00:01:22.590> get<00:01:22.950> that<00:01:23.130> so<00:01:23.430> it

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
there's the thing I don't get that so it

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.219 
there's the thing I don't get that so it
says<00:01:23.700> some<00:01:24.000> but<00:01:24.750> see<00:01:25.439> it<00:01:25.680> says<00:01:26.070> Made<00:01:26.430> in<00:01:26.460> China

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
knowing I don't know why they just

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.330 
knowing I don't know why they just
didn't<00:01:42.210> just<00:01:42.450> say<00:01:42.659> made<00:01:43.320> in<00:01:43.560> America<00:01:44.070> or<00:01:44.130> me

I mean this but is pretty cool as well
the<00:01:55.380> fact<00:01:55.590> that<00:01:55.969> because<00:01:56.969> it's<00:01:57.240> like<00:01:57.360> a

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
the fact that because it's like a

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.719 
the fact that because it's like a
v-shape<00:01:58.009> that's<00:01:59.009> where<00:01:59.130> you<00:01:59.189> put<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.460> string

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
v-shape that's where you put the string

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.730 
v-shape that's where you put the string
where<00:02:00.180> you<00:02:00.329> you<00:02:00.659> put<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.960> strings<00:02:01.259> is<00:02:01.439> like<00:02:01.590> in

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
where you you put the strings is like in

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.069 
where you you put the strings is like in
the<00:02:01.829> v-shape<00:02:02.610> as<00:02:02.850> you<00:02:02.969> can<00:02:03.090> see<00:02:03.299> which<00:02:03.960> is

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
the v-shape as you can see which is

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.449 
the v-shape as you can see which is
really<00:02:04.320> cool<00:02:05.540> it's<00:02:06.540> very<00:02:06.840> I<00:02:07.229> mean<00:02:08.129> it's<00:02:08.310> got

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
really cool it's very I mean it's got

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.869 
really cool it's very I mean it's got
these<00:02:08.610> three<00:02:09.209> knobs<00:02:10.050> things<00:02:11.009> I<00:02:11.310> mean<00:02:11.610> you<00:02:11.730> can

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
these three knobs things I mean you can

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.820 
these three knobs things I mean you can
switch<00:02:12.209> it<00:02:12.450> where<00:02:13.080> the<00:02:13.170> switches<00:02:13.530> but

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
switch it where the switches but

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.590 
switch it where the switches but
they<00:02:14.220> don't<00:02:14.460> really<00:02:14.640> seem<00:02:14.850> to<00:02:15.000> make<00:02:15.150> so<00:02:15.450> much

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
they don't really seem to make so much

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.870 
they don't really seem to make so much
of<00:02:15.750> a<00:02:15.810> different<00:02:16.140> sound<00:02:16.410> as<00:02:16.740> like<00:02:16.920> yeah<00:02:17.760> I'm

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
of a different sound as like yeah I'm

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.550 
of a different sound as like yeah I'm
there's<00:02:18.150> ones<00:02:18.330> like<00:02:18.540> on<00:02:18.690> my<00:02:18.870> administering

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
there's ones like on my administering

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.700 
there's ones like on my administering
example<00:02:20.010> it's<00:02:20.160> like<00:02:20.190> as<00:02:20.610> like<00:02:20.910> there's<00:02:21.840> got

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
example it's like as like there's got

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.860 
example it's like as like there's got
like<00:02:22.860> about<00:02:23.040> four<00:02:23.340> settings<00:02:23.790> and<00:02:24.060> like<00:02:24.150> this

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
like about four settings and like this

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.720 
like about four settings and like this
one's<00:02:25.050> only<00:02:25.200> got<00:02:25.410> three<00:02:25.740> but<00:02:26.010> they<00:02:26.520> don't

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
one's only got three but they don't

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.190 
one's only got three but they don't
really<00:02:26.910> sound<00:02:27.090> a<00:02:27.270> lot<00:02:27.360> different<00:02:27.840> so<00:02:28.020> if<00:02:28.110> you

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
really sound a lot different so if you

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.960 
really sound a lot different so if you
want<00:02:28.350> to<00:02:28.410> do<00:02:28.620> those<00:02:28.920> whatever<00:02:29.460> you<00:02:29.640> can<00:02:29.790> just

want to do those whatever you can just

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.400 
want to do those whatever you can just
keep<00:02:30.120> it<00:02:30.330> basically<00:02:30.720> in<00:02:30.810> that<00:02:30.930> saying<00:02:31.230> and

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
keep it basically in that saying and

keep it basically in that saying and
it'll<00:02:31.590> sound<00:02:31.740> absolutely<00:02:32.010> fine<00:02:32.400> for<00:02:32.870> riverman

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870
