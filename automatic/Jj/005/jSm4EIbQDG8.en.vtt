00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.080
 Gude you can still go to the 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.160
 Remember Portuguese tart 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.319
 they were beautiful 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.730
 caramel sauce poured over it 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.320
 I get dozens of mails where in there 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.509
 stand here you can show us how 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.519
 you can make such a sauce well I can 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.020
 show it to be so super easy 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.910
 to make that even almost me 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.949
 embarrassing to show it to you 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.050
 I have the sauce here now and how to 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:27.180
 that's exactly what I'm showing you now 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:30.539
 a lot of fun here cries for caramel sauce 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.009
 So there's also caramel sauce I show 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.880
 Make it so simple now 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.670
 how easy is it 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.890
 born as the first 200 grams of hops 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.570
 sweets or caramel candies or like 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.090
 you always want to call the things 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.539
 and because me the natural paper roll 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.469
 Let's get them all out first 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:47.910
 that unpacking is of course that 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.629
 annoying in the whole story though 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.940
 we can not get around that as well 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.680
 Now ignite the gas stove and please 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.120
 make sure that now the smallest 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.160
 flame really sets the 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.750
 very little what happens when we give 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.180
 Now here at El Bronx in the pot 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.530
 we really want to spelze us now 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.140
 they do not want to show up so that is 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.030
 really do not choose anything white 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.159
 Now we take a role in cutting them 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.380
 a middle through and squeeze the juice 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.450
 out because that squeeze out now 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.460
 I took myself infinitely long 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.549
 thought just right now delete 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.530
 wanted to sit there nice two 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.369
 cannibal and eat a clown says 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.680
 one to the other 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:31.380
 here somehow tastes funny super 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.060
 But as I said , the world likes to announce 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.409
 but we complain so today 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.210
 nonsense do not forget the sweets 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.979
 Let's take a look, yes, that looks great 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.939
 out 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.049
 Next, I go a shot 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.430
 condensed milk into it 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.259
 I have one with a very high one now 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.640
 Held around I think 12 percent 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.970
 or 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:52.530
 since there is really only to be shot 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:56.030
 it will be around the lake and now I will give 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.030
 still the juice of the whole industry inside 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.289
 The whole thing is just unmoved 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.710
 until the candies are melted and 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:05.670
 then ours is already finished 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.530
 Now you just have to do the sauce 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.539
 fill up and let it cool 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.519
 and I'm almost sure 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.390
 this sensationally good caramel sauce 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:14.160
 imitate it 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.120
 for you to do that, you need the following 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.500
 Ingredients 200 grams of coffee caramel sweets 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.600
 a shot of condensed milk with twelve 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.430
 percent fat and the juice of one 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.440
 orange and that's it 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.620
 in this sense if you like the video 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.810
 I liked thumbs up 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.060
 subscribed to main channel continues in 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.450
 this sense good appetite and bye 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.450
 See you
