00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
had some conflicting emotions i guess

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.779 
had some conflicting emotions i guess
you<00:01:01.469> could<00:01:01.590> say<00:01:01.770> about<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.219> sniping<00:01:02.579> in<00:01:02.699> this

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
you could say about the sniping in this

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.210 
you could say about the sniping in this
game<00:01:03.000> because<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:04.350> be<00:01:04.470> honest<00:01:04.710> i'm<00:01:04.860> not<00:01:04.920> the

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
game because to be honest i'm not the

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.030 
game because to be honest i'm not the
biggest<00:01:05.430> fan<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:05.970> getting<00:01:06.659> quick<00:01:07.020> scoped<00:01:07.409> yeah

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
biggest fan of getting quick scoped yeah

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.039 
biggest fan of getting quick scoped yeah
that's<00:01:08.430> not<00:01:08.670> that's<00:01:09.000> not<00:01:09.180> really<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.510> secret<00:01:09.750> I

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
that's not that's not really a secret I

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.510 
that's not that's not really a secret I
was<00:01:10.229> never<00:01:10.409> really<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.860> fan<00:01:11.189> of<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.490> whole

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
was never really a fan of the whole

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.770 
was never really a fan of the whole
quickscoping<00:01:12.510> scene<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.939> black<00:01:14.939> ops<00:01:15.180> 2<00:01:15.450> made

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
quickscoping scene and black ops 2 made

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.649 
quickscoping scene and black ops 2 made
quickscoping<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.880> hell<00:01:17.880> of<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:18.090> lot<00:01:18.240> easier<00:01:18.450> than

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
quickscoping a hell of a lot easier than

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.780 
quickscoping a hell of a lot easier than
I<00:01:18.869> thought<00:01:18.900> it<00:01:19.200> would<00:01:19.350> mostly<00:01:20.280> because<00:01:20.490> of<00:01:20.640> the

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
I thought it would mostly because of the

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.240 
I thought it would mostly because of the
way<00:01:20.909> that<00:01:21.060> sniping<00:01:21.479> was<00:01:21.689> in<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.830> first<00:01:23.040> black

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
way that sniping was in the first black

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.149 
way that sniping was in the first black
ops<00:01:23.460> but<00:01:24.210> this<00:01:24.420> game<00:01:24.659> black<00:01:24.960> ops<00:01:25.110> 2<00:01:25.380> was<00:01:25.590> really

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
ops but this game black ops 2 was really

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.950 
ops but this game black ops 2 was really
the<00:01:26.310> first<00:01:26.340> time<00:01:26.729> I<00:01:26.909> actually<00:01:27.180> made<00:01:27.600> an<00:01:27.750> effort

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
the first time I actually made an effort

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.130 
the first time I actually made an effort
to<00:01:28.680> use<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.250> sniper<00:01:29.610> rifle<00:01:29.729> like<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.329> consistent

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
to use a sniper rifle like a consistent

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.370 
to use a sniper rifle like a consistent
effort<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:32.180> I'm<00:01:33.180> not<00:01:33.450> really<00:01:33.659> that<00:01:33.869> mad<00:01:34.079> at<00:01:34.259> it

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
effort and I'm not really that mad at it

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.590 
effort and I'm not really that mad at it
