00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
and no one else can hear him so this

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.940 
and no one else can hear him so this

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
definitely means that Samuel is within

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.560 
definitely means that Samuel is within
the<00:01:53.130> ether<00:01:53.369> now<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:53.790> if<00:01:54.240> that's<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.509> case

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
the ether now and if that's the case

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.200 
the ether now and if that's the case
does<00:01:54.960> that<00:01:55.140> mean<00:01:55.290> that<00:01:55.320> he<00:01:55.619> is<00:01:56.000> interim<00:01:57.000> like

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
does that mean that he is interim like

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.940 
does that mean that he is interim like
inside<00:01:57.540> samantha's<00:01:57.990> body<00:01:58.020> now<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:58.619> maybe<00:01:58.799> in

it's part of the easter egg and buried
the<00:02:51.250> characters<00:02:51.610> do<00:02:51.730> actually<00:02:52.120> all<00:02:52.239> die<00:02:52.480> so<00:02:52.810> if

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
the characters do actually all die so if

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:53.940 
the characters do actually all die so if
we're<00:02:53.019> playing<00:02:53.110> as<00:02:53.320> a<00:02:53.350> new<00:02:53.470> characters<00:02:53.800> in<00:02:53.890> the

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
we're playing as a new characters in the

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.410 
we're playing as a new characters in the
file<00:02:54.100> deal<00:02:54.340> c<00:02:54.519> does<00:02:54.700> that<00:02:54.850> mean<00:02:55.060> that<00:02:55.090> we're

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
file deal c does that mean that we're

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:56.790 
file deal c does that mean that we're
gonna<00:02:55.510> be<00:02:55.660> actually<00:02:55.810> playing<00:02:55.959> some<00:02:56.440> assets

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
gonna be actually playing some assets

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.440 
gonna be actually playing some assets
that<00:02:56.950> have<00:02:57.010> Richthofen<00:02:57.640> and<00:02:57.790> does<00:02:58.269> that<00:02:58.390> mean

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
that have Richthofen and does that mean

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.660 
that have Richthofen and does that mean
that<00:02:58.660> if<00:02:58.989> we're<00:02:59.110> playing<00:02:59.200> a<00:02:59.380> samantha<00:02:59.920> is<00:03:00.069> that

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
that if we're playing a samantha is that

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.420 
that if we're playing a samantha is that
but<00:03:00.850> that<00:03:01.330> means<00:03:01.480> it's<00:03:01.660> clearly<00:03:02.170> after<00:03:02.430> buried

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
but that means it's clearly after buried

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.040 
but that means it's clearly after buried
taking<00:03:03.910> place<00:03:04.120> or<00:03:04.360> do<00:03:04.690> you<00:03:04.780> think<00:03:04.810> it's<00:03:04.989> gonna

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
taking place or do you think it's gonna

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.440 
taking place or do you think it's gonna
be<00:03:05.140> taking<00:03:05.470> place<00:03:05.680> before<00:03:06.190> Barry<00:03:06.670> before<00:03:07.330> like

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
be taking place before Barry before like

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.180 
be taking place before Barry before like
everything<00:03:07.930> else<00:03:08.080> happened<00:03:08.530> and<00:03:08.680> a<00:03:09.040> lot<00:03:09.160> of

everything else happened and a lot of

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.080 
everything else happened and a lot of
people<00:03:09.370> have<00:03:09.459> been<00:03:09.550> saying<00:03:09.700> it's<00:03:09.880> actually

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
people have been saying it's actually

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.160 
people have been saying it's actually
going<00:03:10.180> to<00:03:10.269> take<00:03:10.390> place<00:03:10.630> around<00:03:10.780> the<00:03:10.959> time

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170

don't have any proof or evidence back in
that<00:03:15.250> theory<00:03:15.430> up<00:03:15.640> if<00:03:15.850> it<00:03:16.269> is<00:03:16.360> taking<00:03:16.630> place

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
that theory up if it is taking place

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.360 
that theory up if it is taking place
before<00:03:17.110> Nocturne<00:03:17.530> tone<00:03:17.769> that<00:03:18.190> would

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
before Nocturne tone that would

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.039 
before Nocturne tone that would
technically<00:03:18.670> mean<00:03:18.910> it's<00:03:19.180> before<00:03:19.630> any<00:03:19.810> of<00:03:19.930> them

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
technically mean it's before any of them

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:22.560 
technically mean it's before any of them
really<00:03:20.079> knew<00:03:20.440> each<00:03:20.470> other<00:03:20.739> and<00:03:21.390> they<00:03:22.390> would

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
really knew each other and they would

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.289 
really knew each other and they would
all<00:03:22.750> kind<00:03:23.140> of<00:03:23.200> be<00:03:23.489> different<00:03:24.489> characters<00:03:24.970> and

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299 
all kind of be different characters and

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:27.330 
all kind of be different characters and
they<00:03:26.200> wouldn't<00:03:26.440> have<00:03:26.560> the<00:03:26.620> same<00:03:26.769> personality

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
they wouldn't have the same personality

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.280 
they wouldn't have the same personality
to<00:03:27.489> each<00:03:27.640> other<00:03:27.790> as<00:03:27.940> they<00:03:28.060> do<00:03:28.540> in<00:03:28.870> black<00:03:29.049> ops<00:03:29.200> 1

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
to each other as they do in black ops 1

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.110 
to each other as they do in black ops 1
because<00:03:30.070> they<00:03:30.160> all<00:03:30.280> knew<00:03:30.610> each<00:03:30.640> other<00:03:30.940> from

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
because they all knew each other from

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.210 
because they all knew each other from
like<00:03:31.329> she<00:03:31.450> no<00:03:31.570> numa<00:03:31.840> so<00:03:32.350> he<00:03:32.890> think<00:03:33.040> we're<00:03:33.130> gonna
