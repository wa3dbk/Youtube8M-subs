this video is going to be about how to
make<00:00:07.319> the<00:00:07.560> lego<00:00:08.250> halo<00:00:09.090> Sentinel<00:00:09.719> that<00:00:09.750> I<00:00:09.929> made

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
make the lego halo Sentinel that I made

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.780 
make the lego halo Sentinel that I made
and<00:00:10.460> the<00:00:11.460> little<00:00:11.759> cell<00:00:11.969> beam<00:00:12.300> there<00:00:13.759> so<00:00:14.759> uh

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
and the little cell beam there so uh

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.370 
and the little cell beam there so uh
let's<00:00:15.240> get<00:00:15.420> started<00:00:17.750> so<00:00:18.750> I<00:00:18.779> guess<00:00:19.170> we'll<00:00:19.260> start

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
let's get started so I guess we'll start

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.429 
let's get started so I guess we'll start
with<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.619> Sentinel<00:00:20.010> beam<00:00:20.189> first<00:00:20.869> so<00:00:21.869> what<00:00:22.260> you

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
with the Sentinel beam first so what you

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.300 
with the Sentinel beam first so what you
want<00:00:22.769> is<00:00:24.380> great<00:00:25.380> handle<00:00:25.710> like<00:00:25.830> this<00:00:26.720> and<00:00:27.720> take

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 
want is great handle like this and take

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.400 
want is great handle like this and take
black<00:00:29.310> one<00:00:29.490> of<00:00:29.609> these<00:00:30.170> put<00:00:31.170> it<00:00:31.260> right<00:00:31.289> there
