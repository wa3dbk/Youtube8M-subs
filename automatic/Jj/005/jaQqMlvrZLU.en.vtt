00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
ago mercedes-benz invented a new segment

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.570 
ago mercedes-benz invented a new segment
with<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.599> larger<00:00:16.020> CLS<00:00:16.680> class<00:00:16.980> and<00:00:17.250> the

the<00:00:19.770> CLA<00:00:20.160> is<00:00:20.400> revolutionary<00:00:21.060> not<00:00:21.420> just

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
the CLA is revolutionary not just

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.300 
the CLA is revolutionary not just
because<00:00:22.109> it's<00:00:22.380> creating<00:00:22.769> its<00:00:22.859> own<00:00:22.949> segment

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
because it's creating its own segment

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.519 
because it's creating its own segment
but<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.180> fact<00:00:24.449> it<00:00:24.660> is<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.900> first<00:00:25.080> front-wheel

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.660 

okay<00:01:13.080> so<00:01:13.140> basically<00:01:13.470> what<00:01:13.710> Mercedes<00:01:14.250> has<00:01:14.400> done

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
okay so basically what Mercedes has done

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.870 
okay so basically what Mercedes has done
here<00:01:15.000> is<00:01:15.180> crunch<00:01:15.900> down<00:01:16.200> their<00:01:16.650> expensive<00:01:17.400> CLS

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
here is crunch down their expensive CLS

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.210 
here is crunch down their expensive CLS
given<00:01:18.300> most<00:01:18.660> of<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.870> styling<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.500> CLA<00:01:19.950> and

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
given most of the styling to the CLA and

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.160 
given most of the styling to the CLA and
you<00:01:20.670> know<00:01:20.760> some<00:01:20.940> people<00:01:21.060> might<00:01:21.270> argue<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:21.660> it

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
you know some people might argue that it

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.200 
you know some people might argue that it
dilutes<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.890> brand<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.520> then<00:01:23.640> it<00:01:23.730> takes<00:01:23.970> away

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
dilutes the brand and then it takes away

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.140 
dilutes the brand and then it takes away
from<00:01:24.240> pricier<00:01:25.230> more<00:01:25.410> exclusive<00:01:26.010> products<00:01:26.610> and

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
from pricier more exclusive products and

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.540 
from pricier more exclusive products and
respectfully<00:01:27.960> disagree<00:01:28.140> because<00:01:28.980> I<00:01:29.160> think<00:01:29.430> it

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:29.550 
respectfully disagree because I think it

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.850 
respectfully disagree because I think it
opens<00:01:29.880> that<00:01:30.300> stuff<00:01:30.690> up<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:30.990> more<00:01:31.320> people<00:01:31.740> and

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
opens that stuff up to more people and

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.500 
opens that stuff up to more people and
probably<00:01:32.250> spreads<00:01:32.730> the<00:01:32.880> brand<00:01:33.120> image<00:01:33.300> you

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:33.510 
probably spreads the brand image you

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.150 
probably spreads the brand image you
know<00:01:33.660> you've<00:01:34.080> really<00:01:34.380> got<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.680> recognize<00:01:34.830> the

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.160 
know you've really got to recognize the

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.820 
know you've really got to recognize the
fact<00:01:35.370> that<00:01:35.460> this<00:01:35.700> is<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.180> low-cost<00:01:36.840> car<00:01:37.290> with

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
fact that this is a low-cost car with

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.920 
fact that this is a low-cost car with
really<00:01:38.580> high-end<00:01:38.970> styling<00:01:39.480> but<00:01:39.600> that<00:01:39.750> raises

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
really high-end styling but that raises

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.500 
really high-end styling but that raises
one<00:01:40.260> question<00:01:40.740> in<00:01:40.890> my<00:01:41.070> mind<00:01:41.100> does<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.330> engine

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.510 
one question in my mind does the engine

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:43.940 
one question in my mind does the engine
the<00:01:42.870> transmission<00:01:42.900> all<00:01:43.350> that<00:01:43.500> does<00:01:43.620> it<00:01:43.740> live

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
the transmission all that does it live

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.550 
the transmission all that does it live
up<00:01:43.980> to<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.780> aggressive<00:01:45.780> good<00:01:46.140> looks<00:01:46.350> that<00:01:46.470> we

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
up to the aggressive good looks that we

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.970 
up to the aggressive good looks that we
have

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:46.980 
have

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.740 
have
yeah<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.640> two-liter<00:01:48.030> turbo<00:01:48.060> is<00:01:48.390> actually<00:01:48.690> a

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
yeah the two-liter turbo is actually a

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.810 
yeah the two-liter turbo is actually a
great<00:01:49.050> motor<00:01:49.320> it<00:01:49.530> makes<00:01:49.740> more<00:01:50.100> power<00:01:50.370> than<00:01:50.790> you

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
great motor it makes more power than you

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.910 
great motor it makes more power than you
would<00:01:51.390> see<00:01:51.660> on<00:01:51.780> paper<00:01:52.080> it<00:01:52.410> feels<00:01:52.620> like<00:01:52.770> it's

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
would see on paper it feels like it's

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.280 
would see on paper it feels like it's
pushing<00:01:53.100> up<00:01:53.370> close<00:01:53.550> to<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.790> 240<00:01:54.360> as<00:01:54.570> opposed

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
pushing up close to the 240 as opposed

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.010 
pushing up close to the 240 as opposed
to<00:01:55.470> just<00:01:55.710> over<00:01:55.920> 200<00:01:56.400> now<00:01:56.970> the<00:01:57.450> problem<00:01:57.900> with

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
to just over 200 now the problem with

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.360 
to just over 200 now the problem with
the<00:01:58.140> engine<00:01:58.320> is<00:01:58.620> it's<00:01:58.860> hooked<00:01:59.040> up<00:01:59.160> to<00:01:59.340> a

00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.370 
the engine is it's hooked up to a

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.070 
the engine is it's hooked up to a
7-speed<00:01:59.700> dual-clutch<00:02:00.120> transmission<00:02:00.900> which

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
7-speed dual-clutch transmission which

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.110 
7-speed dual-clutch transmission which
normally<00:02:01.650> would<00:02:01.860> be<00:02:01.890> great<00:02:02.280> news<00:02:02.460> but<00:02:02.820> in<00:02:02.940> this

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.120 
normally would be great news but in this

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.719 
normally would be great news but in this
application<00:02:03.330> it<00:02:04.170> is<00:02:04.860> pretty<00:02:05.160> rough<00:02:05.460> that

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
application it is pretty rough that

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.969 
application it is pretty rough that
hesitate<00:02:06.390> especially<00:02:07.170> around<00:02:07.260> the<00:02:07.440> city<00:02:07.710> it

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
hesitate especially around the city it

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.600 
hesitate especially around the city it
doesn't<00:02:08.610> seem<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.390> be<00:02:09.720> all<00:02:09.750> that<00:02:10.140> smooth<00:02:10.610> it's

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
doesn't seem to be all that smooth it's

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.680 
doesn't seem to be all that smooth it's
not<00:02:11.730> for<00:02:11.850> a<00:02:11.880> starting<00:02:12.209> price<00:02:12.330> for<00:02:12.510> around

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
not for a starting price for around

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.350 
not for a starting price for around
30,000<00:02:13.530> bucks<00:02:13.709> that's<00:02:13.980> really<00:02:14.610> not<00:02:14.730> bad<00:02:15.060> is<00:02:15.330> it

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
30,000 bucks that's really not bad is it

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
isn't quite that cheap but the interior
