 program how to pass a successful exam and 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.780
 show typical mistakes 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.829
 when students fill up what they do not 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.780
 so where they make the usual mistakes 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:54.829
 the bike stands on the side step in front 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.829
 stop line at the start we wear a helmet 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:10.500
 come to the bike we sit down on it 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.270
 forget to remove the side tripping often 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.620
 students worry and forget to remove 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.590
 side step when wrong 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:20.040
 get off the substrate start it up checking 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.430
 pre or i with neutral further we 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.140
 show gesture left turn 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.420
 turn your head to the left turn on 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.979
 first gear and drove exactly on 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.750
 straight 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.970
 it is very important here we will be pepper now 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.220
 corridors show gesture left 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.899
 turn his tower start shows somewhere 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.170
 from the middle of the corridor because at the beginning 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:43.020
 pits if you show the bike in advance 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.920
 can enter on the pits go in mode 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:49.310
 ghana if before turning driving 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.310
 snake 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.960
 need to wait a little bit 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:14.170
 the guy puts up his leg is typical 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.730
 mistake on the exam this can not be done 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.730
 however it is not our student but not 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.370
 less I will tell him now further we 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.370
 get under way we drive through a small 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.150
 corridor in front of the eight 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.770
 Eight is very important right 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.230
 work look she turns her head 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:36.830
 in the direction of the turn we do full 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:39.140
 turn left and drive through more 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.570
 Such a small reviewer shows 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.420
 feminine left skok stop 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:46.790
 before the stop line we turn on the neutral 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.640
 transfer smoothly release the clutch and 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.980
 check even show a traffic cop 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.520
 taking the hands off the wheel that we are on neutral 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.170
 transfer 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.540
 all exam it can be considered 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:00.020
 finished now i will show typical 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:02.180
 errors 1 as I said at the start 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:05.180
 often forget to remove the substrate because 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.910
 what are experiencing the second when we start 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.490
 show I'm old 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:13.600
 turning too early here 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:16.790
 basis motorcycles leave us 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.680
 acceptance here before the turn is very 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.750
 it is important to go slow 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:24.280
 drive because later it will be late and you 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.280
 take out for intelligence 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:35.120
 the background that when driving a snake look 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:37.739
 you need to pass the corridor again 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.500
 Eight very important mode slowly 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:44.819
 drive to no flat gas 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:49.920
 no idle speed driving through 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:52.740
 slow mode if we smooth there 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:56.520
 raskolbas motorcycle on man 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:58.500
 and close show this cruel and important 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:01.830
 stop with the front wheel so that 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:06.360
 it was no farther than 30 centimeters from 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:16.380
 stop the line and not hit the offensive you 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:18.150
 how on this exam to we waited want 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.680
