00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.399 
problem with following censure Arabs
like<00:01:33.240> that<00:01:33.390> a<00:01:33.420> sanctuary<00:01:33.810> didn't<00:01:34.020> go<00:01:34.140> quick

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
like that a sanctuary didn't go quick

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.929 
like that a sanctuary didn't go quick
I'd<00:01:34.890> have<00:01:35.009> no<00:01:35.100> big<00:01:35.280> problem<00:01:35.610> following<00:01:35.729> him

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
I'd have no big problem following him

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.609 
I'd have no big problem following him
either<00:01:36.090> he's<00:01:36.659> a<00:01:36.689> year<00:01:36.869> old<00:01:37.079> or<00:01:37.200> he's<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.350> little

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
either he's a year old or he's a little

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.190 
either he's a year old or he's a little
bit<00:01:37.710> more<00:01:37.860> settled<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.869> so<00:01:39.869> did<00:01:40.049> we

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
bit more settled and so did we

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.020 
bit more settled and so did we
it<00:01:40.409> would<00:01:40.530> be<00:01:40.619> just<00:01:40.799> I<00:01:41.040> think<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.700> best<00:01:41.850> sauce

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
it would be just I think the best sauce

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.880 
it would be just I think the best sauce
on<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:42.329> he<00:01:42.420> really<00:01:42.689> threw<00:01:43.290> out<00:01:43.500> sprinter

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
on that he really threw out sprinter

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.800 
on that he really threw out sprinter
Sakura's<00:01:44.280> domination<00:01:44.939> of<00:01:45.030> his<00:01:45.180> division<00:01:45.479> last

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
Sakura's domination of his division last

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.690 
Sakura's domination of his division last
year<00:01:46.229> did<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:46.799> always<00:01:47.130> think<00:01:47.399> that<00:01:47.460> there<00:01:47.610> was

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
year did you always think that there was

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.389 
year did you always think that there was
more<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.479> come<00:01:48.509> looking<00:01:49.320> at<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.950> this<00:01:50.070> season

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
more to come looking at to this season

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.450 
more to come looking at to this season
and<00:01:50.549> on<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:51.259> was<00:01:52.259> I<00:01:52.530> suppose<00:01:52.860> so<00:01:53.100> but<00:01:53.130> it<00:01:53.369> was

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
and on I was I suppose so but it was

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.179 
and on I was I suppose so but it was
very<00:01:53.549> hard<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.880> improve<00:01:54.090> what<00:01:54.270> he<00:01:54.329> did<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:55.189> he

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
very hard to improve what he did and he

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.039 
very hard to improve what he did and he
set<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.579> course<00:01:56.790> record<00:01:56.909> a<00:01:57.149> new<00:01:57.299> brie<00:01:57.540> on<00:01:57.719> the

set the course record a new brie on the

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.469 
set the course record a new brie on the
bradle<00:01:58.409> is<00:01:58.530> that<00:01:58.649> many<00:01:58.969> horses<00:01:59.969> can<00:02:00.119> do<00:02:00.210> it<00:02:00.329> let

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
bradle is that many horses can do it let

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.510 
bradle is that many horses can do it let
alone<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.689> novice<00:02:01.049> so<00:02:01.079> he's<00:02:01.380> you<00:02:01.950> know<00:02:02.009> his<00:02:02.189> farm

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
alone a novice so he's you know his farm

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.639 
alone a novice so he's you know his farm
is<00:02:02.700> really<00:02:02.850> good<00:02:03.180> he's<00:02:03.450> showing<00:02:04.320> how<00:02:04.409> good<00:02:04.590> he

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
is really good he's showing how good he

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.789 
is really good he's showing how good he
is<00:02:04.740> all<00:02:04.890> year<00:02:05.219> so

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
is all year so

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:07.990 
is all year so
if<00:02:06.950> he<00:02:07.070> can't<00:02:07.280> improve<00:02:07.520> and<00:02:07.700> that<00:02:07.789> would<00:02:07.909> be

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
if he can't improve and that would be

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.279 
if he can't improve and that would be
great<00:02:08.179> but<00:02:08.330> he<00:02:08.420> doesn't<00:02:08.690> really<00:02:08.780> need<00:02:08.989> it<00:02:09.050> on

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
great but he doesn't really need it on

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.259 
great but he doesn't really need it on
him<00:02:09.440> I<00:02:09.649> suppose<00:02:09.950> when<00:02:10.759> you<00:02:10.789> look<00:02:10.970> at<00:02:11.060> the<00:02:11.120> race

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:11.269 
him I suppose when you look at the race

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:13.300 
him I suppose when you look at the race
tactically<00:02:11.810> it<00:02:12.290> probably<00:02:12.650> a<00:02:12.800> fairly<00:02:13.190> easy

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
tactically it probably a fairly easy

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.160 
tactically it probably a fairly easy
race<00:02:13.640> to<00:02:13.819> assess<00:02:14.180> you're<00:02:14.450> just<00:02:14.660> sitting

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170
