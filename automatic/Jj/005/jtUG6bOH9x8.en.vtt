 Hi, girls, today I came to record an appetite.

 box that arrived in May arrived only 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.929
 Today I thought it took forever to 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:20.550
 arrive because today is 25 and usually 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:22.980

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.350
 did not come by total express ' like vineyard 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.490
 Before, I do not know what happened. 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:32.160
 they changed the carrier and it came 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:38.840

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.840

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:52.530

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:18.299

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:21.479

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:26.400
 good soap and half sealed 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:34.049

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.710

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:36.640
