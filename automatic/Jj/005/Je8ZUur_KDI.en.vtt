00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.590
 for the growth of the city 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.170
 mainly for municipalities 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.090
 small metropolitan area that has 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.619
 financial limitations such as francisco 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.119

 Sir, I actually open it up and talk 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.430
 on the crisis of the municipalities that 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.070
 discussion of the march explains that 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.100
 this year as it is dead transit in 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.219
 relation to government loans 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.100
 federal government has had this 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.600
 Yes, it is both the federal government and 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.770
 state government 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:14.909
 We have signed agreements 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:17.540
 partnerships in various segments 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:21.450
 the difficulty is of the municipality in relation 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:25.020
 to make available the documentation that 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.750
 that are necessary, but not always 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.909
 The municipality is currently up to date. 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.159
 It was not even today. 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.170
 placing the house in order assumes in 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.570
 January so let's put the 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.479
 documentation in order to be able to 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:42.420
 be with the 11 with the organs 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:45.390
 kaká recipe so we can have access 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.490
 and the end of the secretariat of 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.920
 metropolitan development actually 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.560
 today a gentleman there talking to the 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.990
 governor as it was the agreements were r 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.950
 in the municipalities will suffer 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.770
 thereby 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:03.009
 or Mr. Geraldo Alckmin has opened 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:07.899
 I do not want to believe that they 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:09.959
 they changed it to the secretariat they are 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:12.760
 setting up a metropolitan fund 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:16.840
 that will replace this 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:19.660
 secretariat so far that I know is no 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.900
 there must be no impact whatsoever because 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.489
 You'll make this exchange, but I'll wait. 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.230
 not because they proposed 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:29.590
 municipality of francisco morato is 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.870
 important this organ that was burned 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.880
 or just share today that the governor 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.819
 lord offering the girls so 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:40.920
 governor he announced he contemplated the 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:43.720
 now 340 municipalities of which 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:47.080
 francisco morato was also contemplated 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.470
 for the creation of a school nursery is é 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:54.280
 one is a state government project 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:56.380
 it looks very good so come on let's go 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:00.220
 try to implant in the municipality we go with 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:02.140
 sure to deploy and quite important 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.540
 is mainly for the municipality of 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.690
 Francisco Morato because education in 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:10.060
 actually a plate and then its the the 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.670
 your administration without this you are already 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.609
 investing in 3d gives in three schools that 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.980
 says in seven months governments of 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:21.100
 government we are getting into 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:24.100
 bidding now the contracting of three 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.620
 schools let's hand with build three 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:29.799
 schools with municipal resources 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:34.230
 Let's change all the toys. 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:36.519
 playgrounds of schools have also short 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.609
 fundamental fact that today we 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:42.069
 we have a delay we have children outside 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:43.480
 from the first year in the city today 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:47.019
 So we have to run with this. 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.790
 So I'll have that in this one now. 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:50.650
 year we still build their schools 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.440
 to cater for children 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.510
 next year's mayor's demand is that 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.860
 if I would then summarize the 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:02.640
 180 days in front of the city ​​hall 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:05.580
 explored, is it right we are our Francisco 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:08.700
 Morato in the city is take care I think it is 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:12.750
 the backwards is the penultimate idh 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:17.100
 of the state world a dormitory city 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:21.720
 is how the majority of the population works 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:24.840
 outside the commercial city is a city 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:27.270
 which has a demand of 111 so we have 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.850
 lots of manpower too much labor to 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.550
 offer people for companies 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:35.130
 which requires labor to look for 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.800
 francisco morato we have we are 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:40.080
 a barn of labor leaves the hands of 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.390
 work for the statute is that we have 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.880
 this partnership also this contact with the 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:50.180
 companies behind three and a half 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:53.700
 Our monthly average of our the pat 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:57.810
 employee assistance program 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:05:02.040
 we have around ten thousand ten thousand 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:04.830
 rotating workers in the 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:07.910
 get a job in companies 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:13.290
 today we have on average 105 buses 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:17.160
 daily 150 in the average of 40 forty 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:19.290
 places to do it coming and dead 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.620
 taking workers and distributed 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.620
 in the region 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:30.150
 Let's improve this. 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:33.720
 in addition to health -care employment in our 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:35.669
 Health is a national problem is as 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:39.870
 we do not have bigger ones 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:42.870
 investments in sus is how much the government 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:48.150
 in a state by not investing more 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:50.130
 in health will be difficult for municipalities 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:52.950
 that today the government is with the 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:56.190
 federal government is trying to 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:58.979
 problems to find the solutions for 

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:02.010
 municipalities municipalities as case 

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:03.900
 francisco morato that is a recipe is 

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:05.669
 municipal is small 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:09.570
 depends very much on the state government and 

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:10.800
 federal government as a transfer is not 

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:12.580
 that's enough 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:15.129
 we are in a middle situation 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:18.069
 dude, but we are investing well 

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:19.599
 The priority of my government is 

00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:23.409
 health and education 

00:06:19.599 --> 00:06:25.419
 We're already building three cousins. 

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:28.599
 build three schools this year 

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:31.000

00:06:28.599 --> 00:06:32.919
 we have two schools and two kindergartens 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.319

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:56.139
 past mandate and 3 of our mandate 

00:06:50.979 --> 00:06:58.960

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:21.879
 so they can make a 

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:23.560
 service in the city and we are 

00:07:21.879 --> 00:07:25.539
