00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.300
I made the choice to get a double mastectomy because -- I want the cancer out of my body.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.540
For me, it really felt right

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:25.160
especially after meeting my plastic surgeon and the things he had to tell me and teach me

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.894
 I realized, wow, there can be some wonderful things done with reconstructive surgery.

00:00:31.074 --> 00:00:36.034
And I was excited to have breasts again. I wanted beautiful breasts again.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.554
It’s important to realize that there frequently are options.

00:00:40.554 --> 00:00:42.734
Not everybody understands there are options. 

00:00:42.734 --> 00:00:46.620
Not everybody is necessarily a candidate to go through this whole process. 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:53.054
So I think that it’s important to discuss with your surgeon if it’s something you’re interested in.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.140
I went to him as my first plastic surgeon visit

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.440
and he was very straight-forward.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:04.274
Boy, he laid it all on the line, all the nitty-gritty.  

00:01:04.274 --> 00:01:09.714
He dotted all his i’s and crossed all his t’s.  And I think I walked out of there with deer-in-the-headlight eyes.

00:01:09.714 --> 00:01:14.134
When Stephenie and her husband came to me, they certainly had some preconceived ideas 

00:01:14.694 --> 00:01:17.014
about what was going to be involved

00:01:17.014 --> 00:01:18.994
what they would like to have happen. 

00:01:19.573 --> 00:01:22.453
So I explained to them, here’s what we can do

00:01:22.715 --> 00:01:24.315
here’s what we should do

00:01:24.315 --> 00:01:26.354
and here’s what we should not do.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.280
The second time I met with him I felt it was very personalized. 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.874
And I felt heard and I felt like, okay

00:01:34.874 --> 00:01:38.473
he’s on my side, he’s got my back and we’re gonna make this happen.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.120
It involves multiple surgeries

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.780
frequently takes nine months to a year to complete.

00:01:46.053 --> 00:01:49.333
It may involve implants for the reconstruction.

00:01:49.333 --> 00:01:55.415
 It may involve using their own tissue such as from their abdominal wall to do the reconstruction.

00:01:55.415 --> 00:01:57.034
Everybody’s a little bit different.

00:01:57.034 --> 00:02:02.414
This is a lot of work and there’s pain involved.  It’s challenging and it takes a long time.

00:02:02.414 --> 00:02:05.133
You know, by the time I’m done it will be at least a year.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.974
I think it’s a rewarding aspect of my practice.

00:02:08.974 --> 00:02:13.234
We certainly have a tremendous opportunity to do it here at Kaiser Permanente.

00:02:13.234 --> 00:02:16.728
We probably do over two hundred reconstructions a year.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.194
I love that the way this whole program is set up through Kaiser

00:02:21.194 --> 00:02:26.514
that it’s a team effort and each person is treated as an individual in their treatment plan.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.520
I realize that once I get this diagnosis, it’s a lifetime of being vigilant.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.300
So I am cautiously optimistic for my future, absolutely.
