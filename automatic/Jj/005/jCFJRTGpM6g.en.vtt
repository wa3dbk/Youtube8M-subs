00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
could have possibly been on the ps4

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.390 
could have possibly been on the ps4
because<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.900> Xbox<00:01:10.350> one<00:01:10.590> couldn't<00:01:10.950> handle<00:01:11.310> it

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
because the Xbox one couldn't handle it

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.010 
because the Xbox one couldn't handle it
and<00:01:11.580> there<00:01:11.700> was<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:12.000> know<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.119> wide<00:01:12.510> variety<00:01:12.720> of

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
and there was you know a wide variety of

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.510 
and there was you know a wide variety of
different<00:01:13.380> people<00:01:13.710> being<00:01:13.920> like<00:01:14.130> this<00:01:14.310> is

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
different people being like this is

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.190

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
 and I totally agree with that

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.380 
 and I totally agree with that
because<00:01:16.590> if<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.159> have<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.490> system<00:01:17.970> that<00:01:18.180> could

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
because if you have a system that could

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.660 
because if you have a system that could
be<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.659> better<00:01:19.080> system<00:01:19.619> in<00:01:19.799> general<00:01:20.220> in<00:01:20.400> terms

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
be a better system in general in terms

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.640 
be a better system in general in terms
of<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.180> know<00:01:21.210> handling<00:01:21.810> how<00:01:22.049> good<00:01:22.290> of<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.439> game

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
of you know handling how good of a game

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.410 
of you know handling how good of a game
it's<00:01:22.860> gonna<00:01:23.040> be<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:23.490> you<00:01:23.520> shouldn't<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:24.390> know

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
it's gonna be and you shouldn't you know

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.210 
it's gonna be and you shouldn't you know
limit<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.110> experience<00:01:25.650> on<00:01:25.770> one<00:01:26.009> system

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
limit the experience on one system

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.679 
limit the experience on one system
because<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.790> other<00:01:26.939> system<00:01:27.360> couldn't<00:01:27.570> handle

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
because the other system couldn't handle

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.890 
because the other system couldn't handle
it<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.290> compare<00:01:28.619> this<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:29.159> ps4<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:30.000> ps3<00:01:30.600> NBA

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
it to compare this the ps4 the ps3 NBA

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.039 
it to compare this the ps4 the ps3 NBA
2k15<00:01:31.439> Fiasco<00:01:32.280> that's<00:01:32.790> kind<00:01:33.270> of<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.689> good

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
2k15 Fiasco that's kind of a good

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.109 
2k15 Fiasco that's kind of a good
comparison<00:01:34.619> but<00:01:35.280> there<00:01:35.490> is<00:01:35.640> something<00:01:36.090> that

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:25.600 
except changed you know a couple
animations<00:05:23.629> and<00:05:23.960> maybe<00:05:24.740> did<00:05:25.099> some<00:05:25.340> things

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
animations and maybe did some things

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.790 
animations and maybe did some things
behind<00:05:25.849> the<00:05:26.150> scenes<00:05:26.210> any<00:05:26.990> dollars<00:05:27.409> for

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
behind the scenes any dollars for

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.230 
behind the scenes any dollars for
something<00:05:28.219> that<00:05:28.580> you<00:05:28.669> could<00:05:28.789> probably<00:05:28.909> you

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240 
something that you could probably you

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.240 
something that you could probably you
could<00:05:29.360> probably<00:05:29.539> get<00:05:29.779> NBA<00:05:30.080> 2k14<00:05:30.560> for<00:05:31.129> like

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
could probably get NBA 2k14 for like

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.129 
could probably get NBA 2k14 for like
thirty<00:05:31.610> dollars<00:05:32.089> right<00:05:32.300> now<00:05:32.479> you<00:05:32.990> could

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:33.139 
thirty dollars right now you could

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:35.769 
thirty dollars right now you could
probably<00:05:33.229> get<00:05:33.529> NBA<00:05:33.800> 2k13<00:05:34.250> for<00:05:35.029> like<00:05:35.150> ten<00:05:35.449> maybe

00:05:35.769 --> 00:05:35.779 
probably get NBA 2k13 for like ten maybe

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:38.709 
probably get NBA 2k13 for like ten maybe
so<00:05:36.289> there's<00:05:37.069> really<00:05:37.580> nothing<00:05:38.150> justifying

00:05:38.709 --> 00:05:38.719 
so there's really nothing justifying

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:41.920 
so there's really nothing justifying
this<00:05:38.900> at<00:05:39.080> all<00:05:39.229> NBA<00:05:39.560> 2k15<00:05:40.430> generally<00:05:41.389> the<00:05:41.629> same
