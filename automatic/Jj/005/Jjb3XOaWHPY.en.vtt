00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.810 
basically less than 65 grams okay and
then<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.100> carbohydrates<00:01:50.970> are<00:01:51.689> at<00:01:52.310> 300<00:01:53.310> grams

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
then the carbohydrates are at 300 grams

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.950 
then the carbohydrates are at 300 grams
so<00:01:54.509> what<00:01:54.840> I<00:01:54.869> did<00:01:55.140> is<00:01:55.320> I<00:01:55.409> broke<00:01:55.619> this<00:01:55.890> down<00:01:56.219> and

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
so what I did is I broke this down and

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.510 
so what I did is I broke this down and
here<00:01:57.960> I<00:01:57.990> already<00:01:58.320> wrote<00:01:58.500> this<00:01:58.680> down<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.399> this

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
here I already wrote this down and this

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.630 
here I already wrote this down and this
is<00:01:59.579> basically<00:02:00.000> what<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:01.640> recommendations

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
is basically what the recommendations

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.230 
is basically what the recommendations
are<00:02:02.939> saying<00:02:03.390> on<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.840> back<00:02:03.990> of<00:02:04.170> that<00:02:04.969> 300<00:02:05.969> grams

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
are saying on the back of that 300 grams

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.729 
are saying on the back of that 300 grams
comes<00:02:07.020> out<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.439> 60%<00:02:08.190> carbs<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.739> protein

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
comes out to 60% carbs and the protein

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.950 
comes out to 60% carbs and the protein
is<00:02:10.979> 11%<00:02:11.550> or<00:02:11.849> 55<00:02:12.360> gram

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
is 11% or 55 gram

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.270 
is 11% or 55 gram
for<00:02:13.410> the<00:02:13.500> day<00:02:13.680> and<00:02:13.920> your<00:02:14.640> fat<00:02:14.910> is<00:02:15.350> 29%<00:02:16.350> or<00:02:16.590> 65

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
for the day and your fat is 29% or 65

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.240 
for the day and your fat is 29% or 65
grams<00:02:17.670> for<00:02:18.210> the<00:02:18.270> day<00:02:18.390> at<00:02:18.600> 2,000<00:02:19.260> calories<00:02:19.680> for

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
grams for the day at 2,000 calories for

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.200 
grams for the day at 2,000 calories for
the<00:02:20.340> standard<00:02:20.970> back<00:02:21.780> of<00:02:22.080> your<00:02:22.980> box<00:02:23.250> stuff

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
the standard back of your box stuff

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.050 
the standard back of your box stuff
right<00:02:24.600> here<00:02:24.780> so<00:02:25.740> right<00:02:26.250> off<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.460> bat<00:02:26.640> the

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
right here so right off the bat the

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.260 
right here so right off the bat the
carbs<00:02:27.450> are<00:02:27.660> too<00:02:27.840> low<00:02:28.020> the<00:02:28.500> protein<00:02:29.060> percent<00:02:30.060> is

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
carbs are too low the protein percent is

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.610 
carbs are too low the protein percent is
good<00:02:30.600> and<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:31.200> fat<00:02:31.440> is<00:02:31.680> way<00:02:32.160> to<00:02:32.220> a<00:02:32.460> high<00:02:32.790> so<00:02:33.620> the

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
good and the fat is way to a high so the

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.190 
good and the fat is way to a high so the
ideal<00:02:34.980> recommendation<00:02:35.970> is<00:02:36.240> something<00:02:36.900> closer

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
ideal recommendation is something closer

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.920 
ideal recommendation is something closer
to<00:02:37.770> this<00:02:38.480> 80%<00:02:39.480> carbs<00:02:39.960> 10%<00:02:40.950> protein<00:02:41.370> and<00:02:41.930> 10%

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
to this 80% carbs 10% protein and 10%

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.160 
to this 80% carbs 10% protein and 10%
fat<00:02:43.530> or<00:02:44.180> 400<00:02:45.180> grams<00:02:45.500> 50<00:02:46.500> grams<00:02:46.770> and<00:02:47.160> 22<00:02:47.940> grams

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
at of course 2,000 calories now if you

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.160 
at of course 2,000 calories now if you
adjust<00:02:53.820> this<00:02:53.970> a<00:02:54.030> little<00:02:54.150> bit<00:02:54.540> you<00:02:54.690> can<00:02:54.840> adjust

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
adjust this a little bit you can adjust

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.620 
adjust this a little bit you can adjust
this<00:02:55.350> slightly<00:02:56.010> this<00:02:56.430> is<00:02:56.640> just<00:02:56.850> approximate

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
this slightly this is just approximate

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.370 
this slightly this is just approximate
but<00:02:58.410> this<00:02:58.620> is<00:02:58.800> a<00:02:58.830> pretty<00:02:59.130> good<00:02:59.370> this<00:02:59.520> is<00:02:59.700> a<00:02:59.730> good

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
but this is a pretty good this is a good

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.620 
but this is a pretty good this is a good
percentage<00:03:01.380> here<00:03:01.590> 80<00:03:01.800> to<00:03:02.070> 1010<00:03:02.670> I<00:03:02.940> would<00:03:03.450> not

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
percentage here 80 to 1010 I would not

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.560 
percentage here 80 to 1010 I would not
take<00:03:04.020> this<00:03:04.200> over<00:03:04.490> 15%<00:03:05.490> and<00:03:05.670> I<00:03:06.030> would<00:03:06.210> not<00:03:06.360> take

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
take this over 15% and I would not take

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.940 
take this over 15% and I would not take
this<00:03:06.750> over<00:03:07.160> 15%<00:03:08.160> so<00:03:09.200> like<00:03:10.200> I<00:03:10.350> said<00:03:10.410> you<00:03:10.710> can't

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
this over 15% so like I said you can't

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.860 
this over 15% so like I said you can't
go<00:03:11.010> just<00:03:11.370> off<00:03:11.550> of<00:03:11.580> these<00:03:12.030> numbers<00:03:12.450> because

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
go just off of these numbers because

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.200 
go just off of these numbers because
this<00:03:13.050> is<00:03:13.230> for<00:03:13.410> 2,000<00:03:13.980> calories<00:03:14.400> but<00:03:14.910> I'm<00:03:15.030> going

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.210 
this is for 2,000 calories but I'm going

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:18.140 
this is for 2,000 calories but I'm going
to<00:03:15.270> show<00:03:15.480> you<00:03:15.510> how<00:03:16.260> to<00:03:16.290> do<00:03:16.560> your<00:03:16.800> own<00:03:16.980> how<00:03:17.550> to<00:03:18.000> do

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
to show you how to do your own how to do

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.060 
to show you how to do your own how to do
the<00:03:18.270> calculations<00:03:18.960> this<00:03:19.380> is<00:03:19.530> how<00:03:19.650> we<00:03:19.710> would<00:03:19.920> do

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
the calculations this is how we would do

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.670 
the calculations this is how we would do
our<00:03:20.100> calculation<00:03:21.060> so<00:03:21.600> we'll<00:03:21.840> do<00:03:21.960> it<00:03:21.990> off<00:03:22.350> of

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
our calculation so we'll do it off of

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.390 
our calculation so we'll do it off of
2,000<00:03:23.610> calorie<00:03:24.480> diet<00:03:24.570> so<00:03:25.260> let's<00:03:25.500> say<00:03:25.650> 2,000

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
2,000 calorie diet so let's say 2,000

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.210 
2,000 calorie diet so let's say 2,000
calories<00:03:26.850> okay<00:03:27.630> we<00:03:28.560> want<00:03:28.710> to<00:03:28.770> figure<00:03:28.950> out<00:03:29.040> our

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
calories okay we want to figure out our

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.080 
calories okay we want to figure out our
carbohydrates<00:03:29.850> I'm<00:03:30.300> going<00:03:30.450> to<00:03:30.540> do<00:03:30.660> times<00:03:32.090> 0.8

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
carbohydrates I'm going to do times 0.8

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.780 
carbohydrates I'm going to do times 0.8
for<00:03:33.720> 80<00:03:33.900> percent<00:03:34.550> equals<00:03:35.990> 1600<00:03:36.990> now<00:03:37.860> remember

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
for 80 percent equals 1600 now remember

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.970 
for 80 percent equals 1600 now remember
on<00:03:38.910> the<00:03:39.030> box<00:03:39.240> here<00:03:39.840> where<00:03:40.320> the<00:03:40.380> calories<00:03:40.770> per

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
on the box here where the calories per

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.260 
on the box here where the calories per
gram<00:03:41.010> for<00:03:41.850> carbohydrates<00:03:42.570> it's<00:03:42.750> 4<00:03:44.120> so<00:03:45.120> now

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
gram for carbohydrates it's 4 so now

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.690 
gram for carbohydrates it's 4 so now
we're<00:03:45.390> going<00:03:45.480> to<00:03:45.540> divide<00:03:45.870> that<00:03:45.930> by<00:03:46.140> 4<00:03:46.710> which

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
we're going to divide that by 4 which

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:56.210 
we're going to divide that by 4 which
comes<00:03:47.910> out<00:03:48.150> to<00:03:49.400> 400<00:03:50.720> grams<00:03:54.080> okay<00:03:55.080> so<00:03:55.800> let's<00:03:56.040> do

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
comes out to 400 grams okay so let's do

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:03.310 
comes out to 400 grams okay so let's do
2,000<00:03:57.120> calories<00:03:57.650> times<00:03:59.330> 0.1<00:04:00.330> for<00:04:00.360> 10%<00:04:02.240> equals

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.320 
2,000 calories times 0.1 for 10% equals

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.730 
2,000 calories times 0.1 for 10% equals
200<00:04:05.000> let's<00:04:06.000> look<00:04:06.240> at<00:04:06.390> the<00:04:06.450> box<00:04:06.660> here<00:04:07.050> we're

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:07.740 
200 let's look at the box here we're

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.210 
200 let's look at the box here we're
going<00:04:07.830> to<00:04:07.890> look<00:04:08.070> at<00:04:08.340> the<00:04:08.880> protein<00:04:09.360> that's<00:04:10.320> 4

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
going to look at the protein that's 4

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.210 
going to look at the protein that's 4
calories<00:04:11.760> per<00:04:12.000> gram<00:04:12.210> so<00:04:12.770> we'll<00:04:13.770> divide<00:04:13.920> that

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
calories per gram so we'll divide that

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.340 
calories per gram so we'll divide that
by<00:04:14.790> 4<00:04:15.210> and<00:04:15.480> that<00:04:15.510> gives<00:04:16.170> us<00:04:16.620> 50<00:04:17.580> grams<00:04:18.320> for<00:04:19.320> the

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
by 4 and that gives us 50 grams for the

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:24.080 
by 4 and that gives us 50 grams for the
day<00:04:19.620> for<00:04:20.370> our<00:04:20.520> ideal<00:04:21.090> recommendation<00:04:22.280> now<00:04:23.280> fat

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
day for our ideal recommendation now fat

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.950 
day for our ideal recommendation now fat
let's<00:04:24.720> do<00:04:24.900> 2,000<00:04:25.650> calories<00:04:26.160> again

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
let's do 2,000 calories again

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.640 
let's do 2,000 calories again
times<00:04:27.970> 0.1<00:04:28.970> which<00:04:29.210> is<00:04:29.389> 10%<00:04:29.690> of<00:04:30.289> our<00:04:30.410> calories

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
times 0.1 which is 10% of our calories

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:36.040 
times 0.1 which is 10% of our calories
is<00:04:31.509> 200<00:04:32.509> for<00:04:32.930> the<00:04:33.020> day<00:04:33.169> fat<00:04:34.030> how<00:04:35.030> fat<00:04:35.419> is

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
is 200 for the day fat how fat is

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.200 
is 200 for the day fat how fat is
different<00:04:36.680> if<00:04:36.770> you<00:04:36.889> look<00:04:37.100> on<00:04:37.280> here<00:04:37.610> fat<00:04:38.030> is

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
different if you look on here fat is

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.900 
different if you look on here fat is
nine<00:04:38.449> calories<00:04:38.750> per<00:04:39.020> gram<00:04:39.259> so<00:04:39.800> now<00:04:40.759> we're

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
nine calories per gram so now we're

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.840 
nine calories per gram so now we're
gonna<00:04:41.000> divide<00:04:41.419> this<00:04:41.660> by<00:04:41.720> 9<00:04:42.610> which<00:04:43.610> gives<00:04:43.910> us<00:04:44.590> 22

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:45.850 
gonna divide this by 9 which gives us 22

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:49.779 
gonna divide this by 9 which gives us 22
grams<00:04:46.850> of<00:04:47.240> fat<00:04:48.050> for<00:04:48.889> the<00:04:48.979> day<00:04:49.130> now<00:04:49.550> with<00:04:49.699> that

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:49.789 
grams of fat for the day now with that

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:52.300 
grams of fat for the day now with that
said<00:04:50.060> you're<00:04:50.389> gonna<00:04:50.479> pay<00:04:50.720> attention<00:04:50.750> to<00:04:51.620> the

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
said you're gonna pay attention to the

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.290 
said you're gonna pay attention to the
numbers<00:04:52.789> of<00:04:53.270> your<00:04:54.229> protein<00:04:54.740> and<00:04:54.770> your<00:04:55.340> fat<00:04:55.759> and

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
numbers of your protein and your fat and

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.930 
numbers of your protein and your fat and
your<00:04:57.139> total<00:04:57.289> carbohydrates<00:04:58.160> but<00:04:58.699> this

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
your total carbohydrates but this

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.700 
your total carbohydrates but this
percentage<00:04:59.509> is<00:04:59.690> not<00:04:59.720> going<00:05:00.080> to<00:05:00.139> do<00:05:00.320> anything

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
percentage is not going to do anything

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.180 
percentage is not going to do anything
for<00:05:01.099> you<00:05:01.250> because<00:05:01.490> one<00:05:01.820> I<00:05:02.680> doubt<00:05:03.680> that<00:05:04.009> you're

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
for you because one I doubt that you're

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.790 
for you because one I doubt that you're
exactly<00:05:04.610> at<00:05:04.970> 2,000<00:05:05.630> calories<00:05:06.080> maybe<00:05:06.410> you<00:05:06.620> are

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
exactly at 2,000 calories maybe you are

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.700 
exactly at 2,000 calories maybe you are
for<00:05:07.340> the<00:05:07.400> day<00:05:07.550> but<00:05:08.270> you<00:05:08.720> could<00:05:08.900> see<00:05:09.139> that<00:05:09.500> these

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
for the day but you could see that these

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:11.680 
for the day but you could see that these
percentages<00:05:10.280> are<00:05:10.460> way<00:05:10.789> off<00:05:10.820> because<00:05:11.479> they

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
percentages are way off because they

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.900 
percentages are way off because they
were<00:05:11.750> you<00:05:12.560> know<00:05:12.620> the<00:05:12.770> carbs<00:05:13.039> were<00:05:13.190> too<00:05:13.370> low<00:05:13.610> and

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:13.910 
were you know the carbs were too low and

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:17.620 
were you know the carbs were too low and
the<00:05:14.360> fat<00:05:14.570> was<00:05:14.810> way<00:05:14.990> too<00:05:15.050> high<00:05:15.470> so<00:05:16.389> ideally<00:05:17.389> you

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:17.630 
the fat was way too high so ideally you

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:20.890 
the fat was way too high so ideally you
want<00:05:18.080> to<00:05:18.320> look<00:05:19.130> at<00:05:19.250> this<00:05:19.539> always<00:05:20.539> read<00:05:20.750> the

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900 
want to look at this always read the

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.589 
want to look at this always read the
serving<00:05:21.380> size<00:05:21.680> and<00:05:22.160> then<00:05:22.910> you're<00:05:23.060> gonna<00:05:23.330> look

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:23.599 
serving size and then you're gonna look

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:25.089 
serving size and then you're gonna look
at<00:05:23.780> the<00:05:23.870> numbers<00:05:24.229> but<00:05:24.500> don't<00:05:24.680> worry<00:05:24.770> about<00:05:24.979> the

00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:25.099 
at the numbers but don't worry about the

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:26.920 
at the numbers but don't worry about the
percentages<00:05:25.729> hopefully<00:05:26.389> that<00:05:26.539> helped<00:05:26.810> you

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.930 
percentages hopefully that helped you
