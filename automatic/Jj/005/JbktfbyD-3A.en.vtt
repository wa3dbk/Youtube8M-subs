of my favorite courses Mario circuit for

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.990 
of my favorite courses Mario circuit for
now<00:00:16.170> for<00:00:16.410> this<00:00:16.500> first<00:00:16.680> trick<00:00:16.980> I<00:00:17.160> get<00:00:17.609> crushed

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
now for this first trick I get crushed

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.599 
now for this first trick I get crushed
and<00:00:18.359> that<00:00:18.900> lets<00:00:19.140> me<00:00:19.320> float<00:00:19.710> above<00:00:20.070> this<00:00:20.310> wall

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
and that lets me float above this wall

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.759 
and that lets me float above this wall
and<00:00:20.820> skip<00:00:21.060> a<00:00:21.090> huge<00:00:21.359> portion<00:00:21.630> of<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:22.020> track<00:00:23.029> now

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:24.769 
and skip a huge portion of the track now

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:27.620 
and skip a huge portion of the track now
Mario<00:00:25.769> circuit<00:00:25.980> fors<00:00:26.400> main<00:00:26.670> feature<00:00:27.029> is<00:00:27.420> that

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
Mario circuit fors main feature is that

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.679 
Mario circuit fors main feature is that
loop<00:00:27.930> so<00:00:28.740> my<00:00:29.160> tricks<00:00:29.429> today<00:00:29.760> will<00:00:30.359> involve

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
loop so my tricks today will involve

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.209 
loop so my tricks today will involve
skipping<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.199> loop<00:00:31.349> in<00:00:31.529> some<00:00:31.740> manner<00:00:31.980> or

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
skipping the loop in some manner or

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.959 
skipping the loop in some manner or
another<00:00:33.110> now<00:00:34.110> for<00:00:34.469> my<00:00:34.590> second<00:00:35.100> trick<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:35.579> this

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
another now for my second trick and this

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.479 
another now for my second trick and this
one<00:00:36.149> is<00:00:36.300> probably<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.719> weakest<00:00:37.200> of<00:00:37.350> them<00:00:37.590> what

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
one is probably the weakest of them what

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.750 
one is probably the weakest of them what
I'm<00:00:38.670> going<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:38.969> do<00:00:39.149> is<00:00:39.980> go<00:00:40.980> into<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.430> loop<00:00:41.579> as

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
I'm going to do is go into the loop as

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.850 
I'm going to do is go into the loop as
normal<00:00:42.210> but<00:00:42.780> instead<00:00:43.110> of<00:00:43.170> taking<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.620> track

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
normal but instead of taking the track

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.549 
normal but instead of taking the track
around<00:00:44.190> I<00:00:44.489> slam<00:00:45.300> into<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.690> middle<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.350> sort

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
around I slam into the middle and sort

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.430 
around I slam into the middle and sort
of<00:00:46.620> pivot<00:00:47.460> around<00:00:48.050> to<00:00:49.050> jump<00:00:49.980> away<00:00:50.219> again<00:00:51.410> now<00:00:52.410> I

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
of pivot around to jump away again now I

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.229 
of pivot around to jump away again now I
actually<00:00:52.710> show<00:00:53.129> this<00:00:53.280> trick<00:00:53.460> off<00:00:53.699> during<00:00:54.030> my

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
actually show this trick off during my

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.260 
actually show this trick off during my
let's<00:00:54.449> play<00:00:54.719> with<00:00:54.899> tiny<00:00:55.199> Koopa<00:00:55.530> Troopa<00:00:56.270> but

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
let's play with tiny Koopa Troopa but

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.090 
let's play with tiny Koopa Troopa but
since<00:00:57.570> then<00:00:57.809> I've<00:00:57.989> discovered<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.620> stronger

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
since then I've discovered a stronger

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.520 
since then I've discovered a stronger
trick<00:00:59.340> that<00:00:59.730> lets<00:00:59.969> me<00:01:00.149> just<00:01:00.180> skip<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:01.320> loop

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
trick that lets me just skip the loop

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.979 
trick that lets me just skip the loop
entirely<00:01:01.940> so<00:01:02.940> what<00:01:03.090> I<00:01:03.120> do<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.539> instead<00:01:03.780> of

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
entirely so what I do is instead of

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.899 
entirely so what I do is instead of
jumping<00:01:04.739> into<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.010> loop<00:01:05.189> I<00:01:05.460> jump

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
jumping into the loop I jump

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.390 
jumping into the loop I jump
horizontally<00:01:06.720> onto<00:01:07.680> this<00:01:07.920> other<00:01:08.070> track<00:01:10.400> now

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
horizontally onto this other track now

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.850 
horizontally onto this other track now
the<00:01:11.460> actual<00:01:11.909> jump<00:01:12.360> is<00:01:12.630> tricky<00:01:13.110> there<00:01:13.560> are<00:01:13.830> a

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
the actual jump is tricky there are a

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.340 
the actual jump is tricky there are a
lot<00:01:14.369> of<00:01:14.400> nuances<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.150> learn

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
lot of nuances to learn

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.510 
lot of nuances to learn
what<00:01:18.350> i<00:01:18.380> like<00:01:18.620> to<00:01:18.770> do<00:01:18.890> what<00:01:18.980> i<00:01:19.040> find<00:01:19.250> the<00:01:19.400> most

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
what i like to do what i find the most

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.020 
what i like to do what i find the most
consistent<00:01:20.240> in<00:01:20.360> the<00:01:20.450> fastest<00:01:20.930> method<00:01:21.110> is<00:01:22.070> sort

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
consistent in the fastest method is sort

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.000 
consistent in the fastest method is sort
of<00:01:23.090> go<00:01:23.330> into<00:01:23.750> the<00:01:23.840> turn<00:01:24.080> on<00:01:24.110> a<00:01:24.410> drift<00:01:24.800> so<00:01:24.980> I

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
of go into the turn on a drift so I

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.620 
of go into the turn on a drift so I
start<00:01:25.310> off<00:01:25.430> sort<00:01:25.730> of<00:01:25.790> at<00:01:25.940> the<00:01:25.970> left<00:01:26.270> here<00:01:26.510> and

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
start off sort of at the left here and

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.350 
start off sort of at the left here and
then<00:01:26.720> I<00:01:26.780> start<00:01:27.020> drifting<00:01:27.610> and<00:01:28.610> then<00:01:28.760> I<00:01:28.790> hop

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
then I start drifting and then I hop

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.260 
then I start drifting and then I hop
over<00:01:29.930> the<00:01:30.290> speed<00:01:30.530> boost<00:01:30.800> and<00:01:31.130> the<00:01:31.280> jump<00:01:31.490> slam

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
over the speed boost and the jump slam

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.460 
over the speed boost and the jump slam
into<00:01:32.480> the<00:01:32.540> back<00:01:32.690> wall<00:01:32.990> and<00:01:33.400> then<00:01:34.400> if<00:01:35.200> the<00:01:36.200> jump

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
into the back wall and then if the jump

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:37.750 
into the back wall and then if the jump
had<00:01:36.710> the<00:01:36.890> other<00:01:37.070> direction

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:37.760 
had the other direction

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.310 
had the other direction
and<00:01:37.940> that<00:01:38.510> such<00:01:38.720> me<00:01:38.900> going<00:01:39.110> the<00:01:39.200> right

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
and that such me going the right

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.420 
and that such me going the right
direction<00:01:39.850> or<00:01:40.850> the<00:01:41.120> right<00:01:41.270> hand<00:01:41.480> path<00:01:42.430> we're

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.030 
direction or the right hand path we're
gonna<00:01:43.550> see<00:01:43.760> me<00:01:43.880> try<00:01:44.060> this<00:01:44.120> again

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 
gonna see me try this again

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.660 
gonna see me try this again
stay<00:01:46.040> on<00:01:46.070> the<00:01:46.310> left<00:01:47.200> start<00:01:48.200> a<00:01:48.260> drift<00:01:48.670> Clement

of the luck climb into the back wall and

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.010 
of the luck climb into the back wall and
there<00:01:52.340> I<00:01:52.370> sort<00:01:52.820> of<00:01:52.880> miss<00:01:53.090> spaced<00:01:53.390> it<00:01:53.630> a<00:01:53.780> little

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
there I sort of miss spaced it a little

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.680 
there I sort of miss spaced it a little
bit<00:01:54.290> generally<00:01:55.010> I<00:01:55.040> want<00:01:55.280> to<00:01:55.400> have<00:01:55.580> turned<00:01:55.970> more

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690 
bit generally I want to have turned more

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.870 
bit generally I want to have turned more
and<00:01:56.990> dumped<00:01:57.800> maybe<00:01:58.040> a<00:01:58.160> little<00:01:58.340> bit<00:01:58.520> later<00:01:58.870> to

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
and dumped maybe a little bit later to

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.100 
and dumped maybe a little bit later to
the<00:02:01.880> at<00:02:02.000> full<00:02:02.240> speed<00:02:02.510> when<00:02:02.690> I'm<00:02:02.810> going<00:02:03.020> the

the at full speed when I'm going the

the at full speed when I'm going the
other<00:02:03.140> direction<00:02:03.290> but<00:02:03.920> that's<00:02:04.070> the<00:02:04.280> gist<00:02:04.430> of
