00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
grit flat wheel on there so now I'm

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.020 
grit flat wheel on there so now I'm
going<00:01:00.050> to<00:01:00.110> hit<00:01:00.230> it<00:01:00.320> with<00:01:01.309> my<00:01:01.489> electric<00:01:01.820> da

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
going to hit it with my electric da

sander I've got a 60 grit pad on there
right<00:01:05.150> now<00:01:05.360> which<00:01:05.659> you<00:01:06.070> think<00:01:07.070> that's<00:01:07.310> pretty

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
right now which you think that's pretty

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.570 
right now which you think that's pretty
aggressive<00:01:07.700> and<00:01:08.240> it<00:01:08.330> is<00:01:08.450> if<00:01:08.690> you<00:01:08.810> were

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
aggressive and it is if you were

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.710 
aggressive and it is if you were
standing<00:01:10.580> on<00:01:10.670> a<00:01:10.729> piece<00:01:10.909> of<00:01:11.060> wood<00:01:11.210> or<00:01:11.270> something

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
standing on a piece of wood or something

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.920 
standing on a piece of wood or something
like<00:01:11.810> that<00:01:11.869> but<00:01:12.320> on<00:01:13.220> metal<00:01:13.640> it's<00:01:13.880> it's<00:01:14.509> really

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
like that but on metal it's it's really

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.499 
like that but on metal it's it's really
not<00:01:15.050> that<00:01:15.350> aggressive<00:01:15.700> and<00:01:16.700> of<00:01:17.180> course<00:01:17.360> this

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
not that aggressive and of course this

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:18.940 
not that aggressive and of course this
thing<00:01:17.720> moves<00:01:17.930> pretty<00:01:18.229> slowly<00:01:18.470> so<00:01:18.770> you're

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
thing moves pretty slowly so you're

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.740 
thing moves pretty slowly so you're
really<00:01:19.130> not<00:01:19.430> removing<00:01:20.300> that<00:01:20.420> much<00:01:20.600> material

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
really not removing that much material

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.290 
really not removing that much material
but<00:01:21.200> I<00:01:21.229> do<00:01:21.290> have<00:01:21.500> a<00:01:21.560> few<00:01:21.830> high<00:01:21.979> spots<00:01:22.210> that<00:01:23.210> I

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:23.300 
but I do have a few high spots that I

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.529 
but I do have a few high spots that I
need<00:01:23.450> to<00:01:23.540> take<00:01:23.750> down<00:01:23.780> and<00:01:25.090> so<00:01:26.090> far<00:01:26.270> I<00:01:26.300> found

00:01:26.529 --> 00:01:26.539 
need to take down and so far I found

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:28.480 
need to take down and so far I found
this<00:01:26.690> to<00:01:26.840> be<00:01:26.990> about<00:01:27.500> the<00:01:27.740> best<00:01:27.890> way<00:01:28.100> to<00:01:28.130> do<00:01:28.369> it

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
this to be about the best way to do it

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.450 
this to be about the best way to do it
it's<00:01:28.670> slow<00:01:28.970> it's<00:01:29.300> tedious<00:01:30.039> but<00:01:31.039> it<00:01:31.160> does<00:01:31.280> do<00:01:31.429> a

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
it's slow it's tedious but it does do a

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.190 
it's slow it's tedious but it does do a
pretty<00:01:31.550> good<00:01:31.759> job<00:01:31.880> so<00:01:32.270> I'm<00:01:32.780> gonna<00:01:32.899> get<00:01:33.050> started

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
pretty good job so I'm gonna get started

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.320 
pretty good job so I'm gonna get started
on<00:01:33.380> this<00:01:33.560> and<00:01:33.770> then<00:01:34.460> uh<00:01:34.490> we'll<00:01:35.030> shoot<00:01:35.149> some

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
on this and then uh we'll shoot some

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:44.709 
on this and then uh we'll shoot some
more<00:01:35.360> video

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:44.719 

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:47.139 

well<00:01:45.259> I'm<00:01:45.350> pretty<00:01:45.499> happy<00:01:45.770> with<00:01:46.039> how<00:01:46.340> I've<00:01:46.969> got

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
well I'm pretty happy with how I've got

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:49.179 
well I'm pretty happy with how I've got
these<00:01:47.329> welds<00:01:47.749> smoothed<00:01:48.409> out<00:01:48.590> so<00:01:48.859> really<00:01:49.069> all<00:01:49.159> I

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189 
these welds smoothed out so really all I

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:52.770 
these welds smoothed out so really all I
need<00:01:49.429> to<00:01:49.520> do<00:01:49.899> now<00:01:50.899> is<00:01:51.140> kind<00:01:51.319> of<00:01:51.439> come<00:01:51.619> in<00:01:51.799> and

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
need to do now is kind of come in and

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.260 
need to do now is kind of come in and
scuff<00:01:53.780> up<00:01:53.899> the<00:01:53.960> rest<00:01:54.229> of<00:01:54.350> this<00:01:54.500> Chrome<00:01:55.119> so<00:01:56.119> the

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
scuff up the rest of this Chrome so the

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.289 
scuff up the rest of this Chrome so the
paint<00:01:56.539> will<00:01:56.719> actually<00:01:57.020> stick<00:01:57.289> to<00:01:57.439> it<00:01:57.590> it's

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
paint will actually stick to it it's

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:01.059 
paint will actually stick to it it's
it's<00:01:59.299> really<00:01:59.539> not<00:01:59.630> a<00:01:59.689> tricky<00:02:00.079> process<00:02:00.350> paint

00:02:01.059 --> 00:02:01.069 
it's really not a tricky process paint

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:02.649 
it's really not a tricky process paint
and<00:02:01.219> chrome<00:02:01.399> you<00:02:01.640> just<00:02:01.819> you<00:02:02.060> got<00:02:02.179> to<00:02:02.209> scuff<00:02:02.539> it

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
and chrome you just you got to scuff it

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:03.969 
and chrome you just you got to scuff it
pretty<00:02:02.869> good<00:02:03.109> since<00:02:03.380> you<00:02:03.469> get<00:02:03.560> a<00:02:03.619> little<00:02:03.859> bit

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
pretty good since you get a little bit

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.169 
pretty good since you get a little bit
of<00:02:04.039> tooth<00:02:04.219> in<00:02:04.399> there<00:02:04.750> for<00:02:05.750> the<00:02:05.810> paint<00:02:06.079> stick<00:02:06.380> to

00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:07.179 
of tooth in there for the paint stick to

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:09.309

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
filler primer spray some of these areas

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.160 
filler primer spray some of these areas
and<00:02:52.459> wets<00:02:52.849> and<00:02:53.030> this<00:02:53.269> smooths<00:02:53.599> so<00:02:53.810> I<00:02:53.840> could

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
and wets and this smooths so I could

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.470 
and wets and this smooths so I could
fill<00:02:54.380> up<00:02:54.530> some<00:02:55.489> of<00:02:55.549> these<00:02:55.609> low<00:02:55.880> areas<00:02:56.269> they're

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
fill up some of these low areas they're

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.690 
fill up some of these low areas they're
really<00:02:56.720> not<00:02:56.870> that<00:02:56.930> low<00:02:57.290> and<00:02:57.590> like<00:02:58.310> I<00:02:58.430> mentioned

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
really not that low and like I mentioned

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.030 
really not that low and like I mentioned
before<00:02:58.730> I<00:02:58.970> really<00:02:59.359> hate<00:02:59.540> using<00:02:59.780> body<00:03:00.769> filler

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
before I really hate using body filler

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.879 
before I really hate using body filler
so<00:03:01.310> I<00:03:01.519> think<00:03:02.120> just<00:03:03.079> a<00:03:03.169> spray<00:03:03.380> can<00:03:03.560> filler

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:03.889 
so I think just a spray can filler

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:06.220 
so I think just a spray can filler
primer<00:03:04.130> should<00:03:04.489> cover<00:03:05.450> up<00:03:05.599> these<00:03:05.720> areas<00:03:06.049> just

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
primer should cover up these areas just

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.530 
primer should cover up these areas just
fine<00:03:06.440> so<00:03:06.950> let<00:03:07.819> me<00:03:07.880> wipe<00:03:08.060> this<00:03:08.209> down<00:03:08.269> a<00:03:08.450> little

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
fine so let me wipe this down a little

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.509 
fine so let me wipe this down a little
bit<00:03:08.660> more<00:03:08.870> and<00:03:09.049> then<00:03:09.799> put<00:03:09.950> a<00:03:09.980> coat<00:03:10.040> of<00:03:10.190> paint<00:03:10.370> on

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519

days<00:04:00.400> and<00:04:01.049> that<00:04:02.049> was<00:04:02.170> really<00:04:02.409> just<00:04:02.470> because<00:04:02.859> I

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:02.889 
days and that was really just because I

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:04.289 
days and that was really just because I
