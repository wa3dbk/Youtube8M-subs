00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.510
 very good to all and welcome to this 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.980
 new video of grand theft auto 5 in the 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.799
 let's talk about general topics of 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.240
 information there is some more information 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.650
 still that does not belong to the rest of 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.390
 sections 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.810
 for example we would have that there is a total 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.000
 of 50 bridges on the map 50 bridges that 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.410
 they can all be flown down and down 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.660
 under the bridge and this then 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.010
 would really constitute what is the 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.449
 achievement under the bridge that also what 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.239
 there was in the ballad of gay tony 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.800
 we have to go with the planes or 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.170
 even the helicopter can also be 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.670
 below the bridges we know 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.620
 also that every showcase that we see 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.500
 the city is unique for example I will not see 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.120
 We will not see in 2 liquor stores the same and not 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.280
 we will also see two equal bakeries 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.170
 To give an example , we are told that 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.239
 the night is much more realistic and much 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.190
 darker too that can be destroyed 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.690
 some parts of the scenario but not 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.190
 all in some missions we can 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.140
 destroy pieces as we would have seen in 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.449
 the gameplay that destroyed the wall 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.550
 when the truck fell we were 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.710
 trying to steal but it's not going to happen 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.180
 with all the objects on the stage 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.700
 neon lights would do 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.490
 it's also the typical noise that I eat 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.980
 if it's from the quotes you bring the light 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.840
 also that although the map is 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.180
 available from the beginning there are many 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.890
 places that you have to discover that not the 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.930
 we will have this at a glance and that 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.940
 we must discover for ourselves 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.710
 brouwer street would go back to the saints 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.119
 this was a doubt that we had many 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.890
 what if it's going to be that if they're going to 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.800
 substitute something else for something else 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.210
 Well, if he's going to come back if he told us about 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.880
 the game method about what is the 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.520
 mechanical that if you walk instead of if not 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.080
 you run and you walk when you walk a lot 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.720
 slower than in previous games with 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.340
 which is going to be fundamental that you 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.229
 let's always be light we do not go 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.360
 walking we would also know that it has 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.950
 improved the meteorological system that 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.950
 the physics of water are more realistic 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.229
 there are waves and such that the framerate the fps 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.899
 are stable very stable we have not been 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.180
 said number but we are told that no 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.250
 he does not suffer from shocks nor even 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.899
 when you change character something that 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.789
 the performance goes down a lot because it's not going to 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.789
 be always going to go what is said 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:10.350
 fluid and finally a pretty thing 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.230
 general is that 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.330
 they told us that big picture 5 takes 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.790
 the best elements of each game of 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.530
 rockstar the best of red dead redemption 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.110
 the best of max payne the best of the 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.360
 gta the best of a thousand of the club and the best 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.790
 of each game that the language has made 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.320
 well in the end of all the games that have 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.000
 fact they have taken every part that has 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.860
 come out well from those games have 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.200
 got into this new grand theft auto 5 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.690
 so this brings us an experience 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.190
 awesome and unforgettable without more 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.610
 I hope you liked it and even the 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.060
 next 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.060
 goodbye
