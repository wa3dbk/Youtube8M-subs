 astronomer reference 54 and a new generation 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.580
 astra grain seeders from the company 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.830
 chervonets there which has a number 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.170
 advantages over previous 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:20.530
 models and doing field work more 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:22.630
 economical and exit and the country here these 

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:24.610
 four and universal seriously 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.770
 intended for ordinary sowing 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:29.160
 traditional technology drafts 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.930
 leguminous small-seed crops 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.340
 loose apologize key grass seed with 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.819
 simultaneous mineral

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:46.170
 common grader 2 

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:48.969
 with an engine power of 80 horsepower 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.190
 stop has increased by 50 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:52.719
 percent and grain and those silos 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.620
 compared to the previous generation 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:57.129
 astra deals thanks to seeder 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.109
 apparatus 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:00.129
 from polymeric materials comes down to 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:02.979
 minimize the possibility of mechanical 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.409
 seed damage as well as increased 

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:06.940
 resource of his work 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.710
 everything is equipped with this option 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.510
 stepless transmission mechanism 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.240
 which provides easy and fast 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.300
 adjusting 0 sowing of seeds and fertilizers 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.580
 as well as smoother adjustment 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:23.500
 increased range of normal force aq 07 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:25.270
 then 400 kilogram 2 disc coulter with 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.280
 lighting allows you to produce 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.950
 qualitative passive field with a large 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.420
 amount of underground residues 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.790
 use of the board containing puts 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.560
 increasing resource and opener up to 50 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.180

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.170
 powder coating provides protection 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.110
 against corrosion 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.210
 up to 8 years new universal 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.070
 transport device allows 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.580
 to move sat down on common roads

 provisions in working 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:02.790
 for this in 1 squirrel to secure 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:04.950
 dream of joining thrust 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.220
 dream and then select them as their 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.590
 rods are not nut to prevent 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.470
 overturning snare after detaching 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.630
 from her tractor we turn back the stand under 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.090
 the heart 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.950
 take out the handles on the transport wheels 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.410
 we lower the cylinder fixing brackets 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.380
 we squeeze out hydraulic cylinders for transport 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:29.850
 wheels all the way up and fix them 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:31.500
 handles in the lower hole detach 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.080
 tractor and transport dream 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.019
 just fix the trailer to him transport 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:40.500
 remove it from the wheel and set to 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:42.750
 bracket pro we install cheats 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.750
 working position taking it out 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.340
 transport position 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:51.500
 l join the tractor after which 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.500
 connect and hydraulics tractor links 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.980
 adjustment of the metering unit for 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.319
 settings of the metering machine on 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.390
 the required seed rate we are 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:08.120
 indicative seeding rate chart 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:11.300
 straightened variator and shutter windows 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.950
 power supply sowing machines for example 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.620
 we show the setting of the sowing apparatus 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:18.680
 for wheat in the direction of seeding 240 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.540
 kilogram per hectare according to the chart 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.000
 approximate us you are the power of wheat 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.430
 see that the flaps should be on the second 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.060
 the latch and the digital value of the variators 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.970
 safe 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.500
 also a new generation of village in the astra series 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.700
 has the opportunity thanks in 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.930
 small seed crops 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:38.299
 such as rape mustard for example if 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.910
 we want to sow rapeseed with seeding rate 5 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:42.920
 equal so according to the digital chart 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.390
 the value on the scale of the variator put 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.910
 here 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:49.190
 damper for small seed crops 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:51.739
 setting across and grain release 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.220
 the metering unit has an adjustable 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:54.799
 valve 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:57.819
 allowing to produce seeding as small 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:57.819
 and large sit 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.980
 sowing unit current adjustment 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:07.650
 to obtain the required seeding rate 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.719
 fertilizer selected on the chart you need and 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.090
 the digital value of the corresponding 

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:14.010
 required seeding rate and set 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.199
 variator pointer required 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:19.079

 nitroammofosc 120 kilograms per hectare 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:24.449
 corresponding digital value 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:27.259
 variator will be 30 mulberry salting

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:36.770
 on the fan to the sowing machines can 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.770
 lower it down with the lever 

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:46.280
 coulter depth adjustment 

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:47.900
 the depth of embedding seeds in the soil depends on 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.689
 coulter depths 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:53.599
 which is regulated by the regulator screw 

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:55.629
 burial located on the middle not 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:58.039

00:04:55.629 --> 00:05:01.039
 if the coulters 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:01.999
 reaching follow-wheel tractor seeder 

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:04.509
 or couplers 

00:05:01.999 --> 00:05:07.520
 not deepened to a predetermined depth 

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:09.800
 it is necessary to tighten the springs on the rods 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.669
 appropriate coulters with 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:15.620
 leverage walking in a drop 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:16.449
 also the coulter is equipped with a cover 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.620
 wheel 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:20.990
 depth control 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:23.539
 protection is done by swapping 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.590
 handle when choosing the depth value 

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:28.270
 opener 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.270
 you can use the data table 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:37.100
 adjustment of markers depending on the type 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:39.590
 tractor and driving method of sowing 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:42.380

 before the disk quarks for this we lower the market 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:53.930

 deadline to perform a friend on the necessary 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:58.460
 need for getting well 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:06.350
 visible furrows on the soil will adjust
