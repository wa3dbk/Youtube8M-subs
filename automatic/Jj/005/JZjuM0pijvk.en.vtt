00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
but I found another way which some guys

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.689 
but I found another way which some guys
probably<00:00:46.530> already<00:00:46.649> figured<00:00:46.859> out<00:00:47.070> anyway<00:00:47.460> to

00:00:47.689 --> 00:00:47.699 
probably already figured out anyway to

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:50.569 
probably already figured out anyway to
level<00:00:48.570> look<00:00:48.719> really<00:00:49.530> fast<00:00:49.829> in<00:00:50.039> this<00:00:50.100> game<00:00:50.160> and

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
level look really fast in this game and

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.169 
level look really fast in this game and
it's<00:00:50.699> gonna<00:00:50.910> involve<00:00:51.269> I<00:00:51.600> would<00:00:51.780> say<00:00:52.019> -<00:00:53.120> what<00:00:54.120> is

it's gonna involve I would say - what is

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:55.490 
it's gonna involve I would say - what is
there<00:00:54.269> gonna<00:00:54.539> involve<00:00:54.839> -<00:00:55.019> let<00:00:55.199> you<00:00:55.289> say<00:00:55.440> to

say at least somebody has the power to
up<00:01:01.769> to<00:01:01.800> 10<00:01:02.160> as<00:01:02.370> you<00:01:02.489> can<00:01:02.640> see<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:03.089> think<00:01:03.390> right

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:03.749 
up to 10 as you can see I think right

00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:05.119 
up to 10 as you can see I think right
now<00:01:03.929> you<00:01:03.989> don't<00:01:04.230> see<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.440> in<00:01:04.500> this<00:01:04.589> video<00:01:04.769> but

now you don't see it in this video but

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.530 
now you don't see it in this video but
my<00:01:05.280> power<00:01:05.519> is<00:01:05.880> up<00:01:06.540> until<00:01:07.440> about<00:01:08.180> nineteen<00:01:09.180> now

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.120 
my power is up until about nineteen now

I think something like that cuz I killed
a<00:01:11.250> whole<00:01:11.460> bunch<00:01:11.909> of<00:01:12.030> zombies<00:01:12.450> so<00:01:13.790> what<00:01:14.790> you

getting your ass kicked

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.800 
getting your ass kicked

you can go run back into the light which

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.150 
you can go run back into the light which
will<00:01:30.960> kind<00:01:31.080> of<00:01:31.200> stall<00:01:31.530> them<00:01:31.770> just<00:01:32.040> a<00:01:32.130> little

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.160 
will kind of stall them just a little

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.820 
will kind of stall them just a little
bit<00:01:32.490> but<00:01:32.880> basically<00:01:33.870> what<00:01:34.230> we<00:01:34.350> did<00:01:34.530> was<00:01:34.590> we

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
bit but basically what we did was we

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.710 
bit but basically what we did was we
went<00:01:35.280> outside<00:01:35.460> we<00:01:35.910> made<00:01:36.060> a<00:01:36.090> bunch<00:01:36.330> of<00:01:36.510> noise

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
went outside we made a bunch of noise

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.300 
went outside we made a bunch of noise
and<00:01:36.960> attracted<00:01:37.440> these<00:01:37.590> guys<00:01:37.830> here<00:01:38.100> that<00:01:38.190> you

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
and attracted these guys here that you

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.670 
and attracted these guys here that you
see<00:01:38.460> in<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.610> video<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.200> we<00:01:40.200> basically<00:01:40.500> just

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
see in the video and we basically just

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.800 
see in the video and we basically just
combo<00:01:41.190> to<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.460> detriment<00:01:41.910> I<00:01:42.030> mean<00:01:42.240> it's

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
combo to the detriment I mean it's

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.600 
combo to the detriment I mean it's
already<00:01:43.260> at<00:01:43.560> night<00:01:43.800> you<00:01:43.980> get<00:01:44.130> double<00:01:44.460> points

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
already at night you get double points

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.310 
already at night you get double points
when<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:45.000> kill<00:01:45.240> those<00:01:45.390> guys<00:01:45.660> that<00:01:45.870> I<00:01:45.990> mean<00:01:46.140> it

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
when you kill those guys that I mean it

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.350 
when you kill those guys that I mean it
was<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.710> couple<00:01:47.400> times<00:01:47.640> where<00:01:47.820> we<00:01:47.940> killed<00:01:48.180> him

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
was a couple times where we killed him

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.760 
was a couple times where we killed him
and<00:01:48.480> people<00:01:48.690> were<00:01:48.870> getting<00:01:49.020> like<00:01:49.230> seventeen

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
and people were getting like seventeen

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.410 
and people were getting like seventeen
hundred<00:01:50.160> twenty-two<00:01:50.520> hundred<00:01:50.730> points<00:01:51.210> and

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
hundred twenty-two hundred points and

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.300 
hundred twenty-two hundred points and
that's<00:01:51.960> a<00:01:52.110> lot<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.590> points

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
that's a lot of points

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.340 
that's a lot of points
you<00:01:54.030> know<00:01:54.180> once<00:01:54.450> you're<00:01:54.630> trying<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:54.900> level<00:01:55.230> up

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
you know once you're trying to level up

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.160 
you know once you're trying to level up
and<00:01:55.590> I<00:01:55.950> mean<00:01:56.160> I<00:01:56.640> think<00:01:57.570> it's<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:57.840> good<00:01:57.960> strategy

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
and I mean I think it's a good strategy

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.190 
and I mean I think it's a good strategy
to<00:01:58.830> you<00:01:59.790> know<00:01:59.910> get<00:02:00.150> your<00:02:00.270> power<00:02:00.480> up<00:02:00.840> because

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
to you know get your power up because

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.770 
to you know get your power up because
without<00:02:01.380> your<00:02:01.680> power<00:02:02.450> you're<00:02:03.450> gonna<00:02:03.540> have<00:02:03.750> a

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
without your power you're gonna have a

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.030 
without your power you're gonna have a
hard<00:02:04.020> time<00:02:04.260> running<00:02:04.590> from<00:02:04.620> these<00:02:04.830> guys

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
hard time running from these guys

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.550 
hard time running from these guys
installing<00:02:05.760> these<00:02:05.910> guys<00:02:06.180> and<00:02:06.570> basically<00:02:07.230> when

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
installing these guys and basically when

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.229 
installing these guys and basically when
you're<00:02:07.680> in<00:02:07.770> encounter<00:02:08.489> regular<00:02:08.879> numbers

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
you're in encounter regular numbers

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.460 
you're in encounter regular numbers
you're<00:02:09.360> gonna<00:02:09.509> have<00:02:09.690> a<00:02:09.720> hard<00:02:09.989> time<00:02:10.200> because

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
you're gonna have a hard time because

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.589 
you're gonna have a hard time because
your<00:02:10.590> powers<00:02:10.920> not<00:02:11.069> up<00:02:11.310> and<00:02:11.610> you<00:02:12.060> can<00:02:12.209> only<00:02:12.360> get

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
your powers not up and you can only get

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.449 
your powers not up and you can only get
certain<00:02:12.930> weapons<00:02:13.260> when<00:02:13.410> your<00:02:13.530> powers<00:02:13.890> up<00:02:14.040> so<00:02:14.250> I

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
certain weapons when your powers up so I

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.200 
certain weapons when your powers up so I
think<00:02:14.790> it's<00:02:15.239> a<00:02:15.480> it's<00:02:16.410> a<00:02:16.590> nice<00:02:16.830> little<00:02:17.210> boosting

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
think it's a it's a nice little boosting
