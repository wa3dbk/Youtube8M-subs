00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.510 

when<00:00:03.300> we<00:00:03.480> have<00:00:03.660> drought<00:00:03.930> conditions<00:00:04.560> we<00:00:05.220> have

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
when we have drought conditions we have

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.090 
when we have drought conditions we have
we<00:00:06.359> have<00:00:06.569> a<00:00:06.600> lot<00:00:06.840> more<00:00:06.899> cattle<00:00:07.470> go<00:00:07.590> to<00:00:07.649> market

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:08.100 
we have a lot more cattle go to market

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.850 
we have a lot more cattle go to market
simply<00:00:08.340> because<00:00:08.910> producers<00:00:09.870> it's<00:00:10.530> expensive

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
simply because producers it's expensive

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.620 
simply because producers it's expensive
to<00:00:11.190> buy<00:00:11.340> food<00:00:11.640> and<00:00:11.910> you<00:00:12.000> have<00:00:12.030> to<00:00:12.270> move<00:00:12.450> those

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
to buy food and you have to move those

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.830 
to buy food and you have to move those
cows<00:00:12.900> out<00:00:15.980> so<00:00:16.980> we<00:00:17.640> have<00:00:17.850> a<00:00:18.210> lot<00:00:18.390> more<00:00:18.420> cows

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
cows out so we have a lot more cows

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.020 
cows out so we have a lot more cows
going<00:00:19.260> to<00:00:19.350> market<00:00:19.710> and<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.550> short<00:00:20.820> term

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:21.030 
going to market and the short term

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:22.940 
going to market and the short term
impact<00:00:21.450> on<00:00:21.630> those<00:00:21.780> ranchers<00:00:22.050> is<00:00:22.380> not<00:00:22.560> only<00:00:22.830> are

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:22.950 
impact on those ranchers is not only are

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.680 
impact on those ranchers is not only are
they<00:00:23.039> selling<00:00:23.460> off<00:00:23.610> the<00:00:23.789> productive<00:00:24.300> part<00:00:24.630> of

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:24.690 
they selling off the productive part of

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.359 
they selling off the productive part of
their<00:00:24.869> bird<00:00:25.080> but<00:00:25.590> they're<00:00:25.770> selling<00:00:25.980> Ament

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
their bird but they're selling Ament

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.730 
their bird but they're selling Ament
depressed<00:00:26.760> prices<00:00:27.000> as<00:00:27.480> all<00:00:27.660> that<00:00:27.869> supply<00:00:28.350> goes

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
depressed prices as all that supply goes

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.890 
depressed prices as all that supply goes
to<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.039> auction<00:00:29.369> markets<00:00:29.730> at<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.360> same<00:00:30.600> time

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
to the auction markets at the same time

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.560 
to the auction markets at the same time
that<00:00:31.800> longer-term<00:00:32.250> part<00:00:32.850> though<00:00:33.090> is<00:00:33.420> that

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
that longer-term part though is that

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.660 
that longer-term part though is that
every<00:00:33.899> cow<00:00:34.170> that<00:00:34.230> sold<00:00:34.649> this<00:00:34.890> here<00:00:35.220> is<00:00:35.399> one

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
every cow that sold this here is one

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.760 
every cow that sold this here is one
less<00:00:35.880> calf<00:00:36.210> that's<00:00:36.480> going<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:36.960> be<00:00:37.110> born<00:00:37.440> next

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
less calf that's going to be born next

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.710 
less calf that's going to be born next
year<00:00:38.130> and<00:00:38.579> so<00:00:38.820> we<00:00:38.940> have<00:00:39.090> some<00:00:39.270> longer-term

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:39.720 
year and so we have some longer-term

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.130 
year and so we have some longer-term
impacts<00:00:40.559> of<00:00:40.920> fewer<00:00:41.880> cows<00:00:42.210> in<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.690> nation's

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
impacts of fewer cows in the nation's

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.650 
impacts of fewer cows in the nation's
calvert<00:00:43.710> fewer<00:00:44.550> cattle<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.210> less<00:00:45.360> beef

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
calvert fewer cattle and less beef

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.959 
calvert fewer cattle and less beef
production<00:00:46.050> over<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.010> next<00:00:47.219> two<00:00:47.790> to<00:00:47.940> three

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
production over the next two to three

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.690 
production over the next two to three
years<00:00:48.570> because<00:00:49.320> of<00:00:49.350> being<00:00:49.649> forced<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.399> sell

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
years because of being forced to sell

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.250 
years because of being forced to sell
off<00:00:50.730> part<00:00:51.210> of<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.360> productive<00:00:51.719> herd<00:00:52.050> this

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
off part of the productive herd this

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.280 
off part of the productive herd this
year<00:00:53.180> over<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.360> next<00:00:54.450> two<00:00:54.750> or<00:00:54.780> three<00:00:55.020> years

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:55.290 
year over the next two or three years

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:56.780 
year over the next two or three years
we'll<00:00:55.500> be<00:00:55.620> looking<00:00:55.739> at<00:00:55.950> even<00:00:56.100> higher<00:00:56.250> beef

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:56.790 
we'll be looking at even higher beef

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.090 
we'll be looking at even higher beef
prices<00:00:57.210> than<00:00:57.780> we've<00:00:57.989> been<00:00:58.230> seeing<00:00:58.530> lately<00:00:58.620> and

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
prices than we've been seeing lately and

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.529 
prices than we've been seeing lately and
we've<00:00:59.280> been<00:00:59.489> at<00:00:59.640> some<00:00:59.820> record<00:01:00.149> high<00:01:00.300> beef

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
we've been at some record high beef

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.200 
we've been at some record high beef
prices<00:01:00.800> nationally<00:01:01.800> at<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.340> retail<00:01:02.700> counter

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
prices nationally at the retail counter

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.080 
prices nationally at the retail counter
for<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:03.539> number<00:01:03.930> of<00:01:04.019> months<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.530> so<00:01:05.100> over<00:01:06.000> the

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
for a number of months and so over the

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.730 
for a number of months and so over the
next<00:01:06.119> couple<00:01:06.479> years<00:01:06.690> we'll<00:01:07.110> have<00:01:07.140> even<00:01:07.590> higher

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
next couple years we'll have even higher

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:30.649 
next couple years we'll have even higher
beef<00:01:08.040> prices<00:01:28.880> it<00:01:29.880> wasn't<00:01:30.180> for<00:01:30.330> the<00:01:30.420> drought

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
beef prices it wasn't for the drought

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.210 
beef prices it wasn't for the drought
we'd<00:01:30.900> see<00:01:31.140> some<00:01:31.350> interest<00:01:31.710> in<00:01:31.860> rebuilding

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
we'd see some interest in rebuilding

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.730 
we'd see some interest in rebuilding
herds<00:01:32.670> because<00:01:33.210> we've<00:01:33.390> had<00:01:33.600> calf<00:01:33.990> prices<00:01:34.530> at

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
herds because we've had calf prices at

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.859 
herds because we've had calf prices at
levels<00:01:35.189> that<00:01:35.280> that<00:01:35.880> at<00:01:35.970> least<00:01:36.119> get<00:01:36.360> producers

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
levels that that at least get producers

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.390 
levels that that at least get producers
thinking<00:01:37.290> that<00:01:37.439> way<00:01:37.619> that<00:01:37.830> they've<00:01:37.920> offset

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
thinking that way that they've offset

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.350 
thinking that way that they've offset
the<00:01:38.549> higher<00:01:38.759> cost<00:01:39.150> associated<00:01:39.570> with<00:01:41.360> things

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
the higher cost associated with things

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.770 
the higher cost associated with things
like<00:01:42.600> that<00:01:43.430> Wow<00:01:44.490> then<00:01:44.939> we<00:01:45.090> would<00:01:45.270> be<00:01:45.390> thinking

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
like that Wow then we would be thinking

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.530 
like that Wow then we would be thinking
about<00:01:45.869> expanding<00:01:46.350> approach<00:01:46.860> but<00:01:47.130> now<00:01:47.340> we're

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
about expanding approach but now we're

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.320 
about expanding approach but now we're

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
we've been calling them we're selling

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.090 
we've been calling them we're selling
