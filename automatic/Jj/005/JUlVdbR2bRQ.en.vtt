00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
multiple occasions and I can definitely

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.940 
multiple occasions and I can definitely
say<00:01:24.750> I've<00:01:24.870> all<00:01:25.110> of<00:01:25.200> them<00:01:25.320> what<00:01:25.590> gives<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:25.860> the

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
say I've all of them what gives you the

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.080 
say I've all of them what gives you the
most<00:01:26.160> energy<00:01:26.820> has<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.450> be<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.840> key<00:01:27.990> fuel<00:01:28.290> and

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
most energy has to be the key fuel and

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.970 
most energy has to be the key fuel and
that<00:01:30.090> now<00:01:30.300> the<00:01:30.720> main<00:01:31.020> reason<00:01:31.170> I<00:01:31.410> wanted<00:01:31.440> to<00:01:31.740> try

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:31.980 
that now the main reason I wanted to try

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.490 
that now the main reason I wanted to try
G<00:01:32.220> fuel<00:01:32.490> was<00:01:32.730> the<00:01:33.000> first<00:01:33.240> reason<00:01:33.450> is<00:01:33.660> cheaper

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
G fuel was the first reason is cheaper

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.380 
G fuel was the first reason is cheaper

because you go buy a red bull and what I

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.970 
because you go buy a red bull and what I
would<00:01:36.510> typically<00:01:37.050> do<00:01:37.260> is<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.410> red<00:01:37.620> ball<00:01:37.800> is<00:01:37.890> my

would typically do is a red ball is my

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.500 
would typically do is a red ball is my

top and basically the funnel ads so you

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:11.050 
top and basically the funnel ads so you
