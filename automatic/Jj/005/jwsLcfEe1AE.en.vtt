00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.709
 nominations to the oscar that was announced 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:55.530

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:58.560
 hemsworth and the president of the academy

 cheryl bold aisha with many debutantes 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.349
 and several stories based on facts 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:07.140
 real the list of 9 nominees to better 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:08.879
 movie almost completely coincided with 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.860
 the Golden Globes and 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:13.950
 feature films that start as 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:17.190
 favorites are gravity and scandal 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:20.670
 American with 10 nominations each and 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:22.829
 12 years of slavery with nine more in 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.290
 the heading of best director alfonso 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:28.109
 CuarÃ³n who has received his third 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.910
 Oscar nomination but the first as 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:33.599
 director will have a tough competition 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:36.359
 in front of the consecrated martin scorsese the 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:38.849
 experienced alexander payne and david 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:41.280
 russell who is already on his third 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:44.960
 nomination and the debutant estimated queens 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.780
 that has great possibilities 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.920
 in the category of main actor 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.110
 He was quite surprised to be stopped 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.210
 side to tom hanks and their good work in 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.100
 phillips captain so it seems that 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:58.790
 the fight will be between matthew 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:01.040
 mcconaughey and leonardo dicaprio between 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.260
 the main actresses are all 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.030
 consecrated interpreters who have already 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.340
 won oscar awards or have been 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:12.010
 nominated several times as the 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.010
 experienced meryl streep and judi dench 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.720
 although in principle it seems that the 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:20.520
 nailed performance of Kate Blanchett in 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:23.530
 fights well would you give your second Oscar 

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:25.390
 so we are already on the way to the delivery 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.440
 of the oscar to be held on Sunday 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:30.580
 March 2 before your expected evening 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.860

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:38.080
 different unions and associations 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.270
 which will allow us to have an idea more 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.520
 clear who will be the big ones 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:46.560
 winners of the most anticipated night 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.560
