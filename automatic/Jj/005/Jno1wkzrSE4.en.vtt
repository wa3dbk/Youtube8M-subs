00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
you know not just the the safety stuff

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.259 
you know not just the the safety stuff
obviously<00:04:06.989> it's<00:04:07.709> that's<00:04:08.250> a<00:04:08.430> real<00:04:08.700> Volvo<00:04:09.060> arena

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269

but<00:04:09.959> this<00:04:10.139> new<00:04:10.379> cross<00:04:10.620> country<00:04:10.829> I<00:04:11.010> think

00:04:11.679 --> 00:04:11.689 
but this new cross country I think

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:13.640 
but this new cross country I think
generally<00:04:12.689> love<00:04:12.930> some<00:04:13.079> of<00:04:13.139> the<00:04:13.230> touches<00:04:13.530> on

this<00:04:13.739> I<00:04:13.859> think<00:04:13.980> for<00:04:14.730> a<00:04:14.760> car<00:04:14.939> that<00:04:14.969> isn't<00:04:15.239> a<00:04:15.359> full

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
this I think for a car that isn't a full

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.210 
this I think for a car that isn't a full
blown<00:04:15.689> off<00:04:15.900> roader<00:04:16.169> they've<00:04:16.680> got<00:04:16.889> the<00:04:17.039> right

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
blown off roader they've got the right

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.890 
blown off roader they've got the right
kind<00:04:17.549> of<00:04:17.639> balance<00:04:17.970> in<00:04:18.180> terms<00:04:18.209> of<00:04:18.479> it's<00:04:18.630> sort<00:04:18.750> of

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
kind of balance in terms of it's sort of

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.629 
kind of balance in terms of it's sort of
enhanced<00:04:19.650> it<00:04:19.739> ruggedness<00:04:20.039> without<00:04:20.430> being

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 
enhanced it ruggedness without being

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:23.060 
enhanced it ruggedness without being
overtly<00:04:21.120> rugged<00:04:21.570> and<00:04:21.720> there's<00:04:22.289> some<00:04:22.560> really

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
overtly rugged and there's some really

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.070 
overtly rugged and there's some really
sweet<00:04:23.250> touches<00:04:23.639> inside<00:04:23.970> like<00:04:24.300> copper<00:04:24.840> on<00:04:24.990> the

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
sweet touches inside like copper on the

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
the light of day in a production car and

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.050 
the light of day in a production car and

you're<00:04:37.680> right<00:04:37.860> i<00:04:38.070> think<00:04:38.669> the<00:04:38.759> safety<00:04:39.150> and<00:04:39.240> the

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
you're right i think the safety and the

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:40.219 
you're right i think the safety and the
ruggedness<00:04:39.630> that's<00:04:39.900> quite<00:04:40.080> interesting

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:40.229 
ruggedness that's quite interesting

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:41.659 
ruggedness that's quite interesting
point<00:04:40.590> because<00:04:40.650> think<00:04:40.979> its<00:04:41.099> parents

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:41.669

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
obviously safety makes you feel very

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.320 
obviously safety makes you feel very

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
good you've made those investments in

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.180 
good you've made those investments in
that<00:04:45.539> area<00:04:45.810> but<00:04:46.050> also<00:04:46.169> you<00:04:46.409> can<00:04:46.740> still<00:04:46.949> feel<00:04:47.130> a
