found one of the problems here so you
can<00:00:21.240> see<00:00:21.449> we<00:00:21.600> have<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:21.890> broken<00:00:22.890> spring<00:00:23.310> here<00:00:23.730> on

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
can see we have a broken spring here on

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.259 
can see we have a broken spring here on
the<00:00:24.119> right<00:00:24.300> front<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:25.400> also<00:00:26.400> if<00:00:26.939> you<00:00:27.090> look

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
the right front and also if you look

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.349 
the right front and also if you look
down<00:00:27.510> here<00:00:27.570> on<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.529> sway<00:00:28.769> bar<00:00:29.010> link<00:00:29.359> the

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
down here on the sway bar link the

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.359 
down here on the sway bar link the
bushing<00:00:30.900> and<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.289> bracket<00:00:31.769> that<00:00:31.920> holds<00:00:31.980> the

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
bushing and the bracket that holds the

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.850 
bushing and the bracket that holds the
sway<00:00:32.640> bar<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.239> subframe<00:00:33.630> is<00:00:33.750> gone<00:00:34.140> so<00:00:34.710> it's

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
sway bar to the subframe is gone so it's

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.819 
sway bar to the subframe is gone so it's
just<00:00:35.010> rattling<00:00:35.520> around<00:00:35.670> in<00:00:36.000> there<00:00:36.210> you<00:00:36.829> can

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
just rattling around in there you can

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:44.990 
just rattling around in there you can
see<00:00:41.210> and<00:00:42.210> that's<00:00:42.570> not<00:00:42.780> all<00:00:43.579> look<00:00:44.579> on<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.879> other

see and that's not all look on the other

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.459 
see and that's not all look on the other
side<00:00:45.300> here<00:00:46.160> we<00:00:47.160> have<00:00:47.629> another<00:00:48.629> broken<00:00:48.960> spring

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
side here we have another broken spring

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.939 
side here we have another broken spring
on<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.920> left<00:00:50.129> front<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.960> little<00:00:51.960> torn<00:00:52.230> CB<00:00:52.710> boot

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.639 
on the left front a little torn CB boot
there<00:00:53.250> so<00:00:54.239> I'll<00:00:54.510> either<00:00:54.719> replace<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.469> axle

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
there so I'll either replace the axle

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.099 
there so I'll either replace the axle
shaft<00:00:56.070> or<00:00:56.399> just<00:00:56.969> probably<00:00:57.600> just<00:00:57.870> do<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.079> whole

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
shaft or just probably just do the whole

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.819 
shaft or just probably just do the whole
axle<00:00:58.590> shaft<00:00:58.829> automatic<00:00:59.399> and<00:01:00.649> look<00:01:01.649> in<00:01:01.800> the

axle shaft automatic and look in the

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.440 
axle shaft automatic and look in the
back<00:01:02.070> here<00:01:02.780> and<00:01:03.860> where<00:01:04.860> is<00:01:05.040> it<00:01:05.220> here<00:01:05.519> there's

back here and where is it here there's
another<00:01:06.780> broken<00:01:07.229> spring<00:01:07.560> I<00:01:07.740> can't<00:01:07.979> remember

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
another broken spring I can't remember

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.910 
another broken spring I can't remember
who<00:01:08.430> is<00:01:08.580> this<00:01:08.729> side<00:01:09.000> or<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.270> other<00:01:09.299> side<00:01:09.920> but

swipe<00:01:11.760> our<00:01:11.970> links<00:01:12.650> in<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.770> back<00:01:13.950> here<00:01:14.280> or<00:01:14.430> shot

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:22.760 

let's<00:01:18.479> go<00:01:18.689> take<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:18.930> look<00:01:19.020> at<00:01:19.229> this<00:01:19.380> one

there's<00:01:23.770> a<00:01:23.890> broken<00:01:24.189> spring<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:26.500> can<00:01:26.649> see<00:01:26.890> it

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
there's a broken spring you can see it

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:33.059 
there's a broken spring you can see it
just<00:01:27.189> ends<00:01:27.399> right<00:01:27.729> there<00:01:28.740> broke<00:01:30.240> so<00:01:32.069> that's

00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:33.069 
just ends right there broke so that's

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
brackets and bushings and went out for a

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.270 
brackets and bushings and went out for a
test<00:02:40.989> drive<00:02:41.230> and<00:02:41.440> the<00:02:41.530> suspension<00:02:42.160> is

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
test drive and the suspension is

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.720 
test drive and the suspension is
completely<00:02:43.120> silent<00:02:43.859> smooth<00:02:44.859> as<00:02:45.069> glass<00:02:45.130> ride

completely silent smooth as glass ride

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.110 
completely silent smooth as glass ride
and<00:02:46.230> well<00:02:47.230> I<00:02:47.260> got<00:02:47.500> the<00:02:47.739> old<00:02:48.250> struts<00:02:48.700> out<00:02:48.880> here<00:02:49.090> I

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
and well I got the old struts out here I

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.940 
and well I got the old struts out here I
thought<00:02:49.299> I'd<00:02:49.450> just<00:02:50.109> give<00:02:50.290> you<00:02:50.440> a<00:02:50.470> look<00:02:50.650> at<00:02:50.829> what

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
thought I'd just give you a look at what

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.460 
thought I'd just give you a look at what
they<00:02:51.069> look<00:02:51.099> like<00:02:51.310> here<00:02:51.790> what<00:02:52.180> happens<00:02:52.599> so<00:02:53.410> you

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
they look like here what happens so you

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.129 
they look like here what happens so you
can<00:02:53.620> see<00:02:53.739> the<00:02:53.859> fracture<00:02:54.400> there<00:02:54.609> in<00:02:54.760> the<00:02:54.849> spring

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:55.139 
can see the fracture there in the spring

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:59.069 
can see the fracture there in the spring
that'll<00:02:56.139> cause<00:02:56.319> a<00:02:56.349> noise<00:02:56.739> and<00:02:57.930> where's<00:02:58.930> the

00:02:59.069 --> 00:02:59.079 
that'll cause a noise and where's the

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:02.009 
that'll cause a noise and where's the
other<00:02:59.200> one<00:03:00.150> the<00:03:01.150> one<00:03:01.299> that<00:03:01.480> well<00:03:01.750> they<00:03:01.959> were

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
other one the one that well they were

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.160 
other one the one that well they were
all<00:03:02.139> leakin<00:03:02.709> as<00:03:03.220> you<00:03:03.430> can<00:03:03.609> see

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
all leakin as you can see

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.980 
all leakin as you can see
so<00:03:05.830> the<00:03:06.310> right<00:03:06.490> quality<00:03:06.970> was<00:03:07.120> poor<00:03:07.330> and<00:03:07.750> our

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:07.990 
so the right quality was poor and our

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:09.660 
so the right quality was poor and our
town<00:03:08.200> smokers<00:03:08.680> up<00:03:08.830> there<00:03:09.040> were<00:03:09.160> gone

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
town smokers up there were gone

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.690 
town smokers up there were gone
this<00:03:10.569> one<00:03:10.840> was<00:03:11.800> broken<00:03:12.250> too

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
this one was broken too

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.180 
this one was broken too
as<00:03:12.850> you<00:03:13.090> can<00:03:13.240> see<00:03:13.510> another<00:03:14.410> fracture<00:03:14.920> right

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
as you can see another fracture right

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:21.030 
as you can see another fracture right
there<00:03:15.600> and<00:03:16.800> just<00:03:17.800> all-around<00:03:18.190> worn<00:03:18.850> out<00:03:20.040> this

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
there and just all-around worn out this

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.750 
there and just all-around worn out this
one<00:03:21.250> here<00:03:21.280> as<00:03:21.730> you<00:03:21.820> can<00:03:21.880> see<00:03:22.030> was<00:03:22.390> leakin<00:03:22.810> and

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
one here as you can see was leakin and

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.430 
one here as you can see was leakin and
the<00:03:24.760> spring<00:03:25.150> was<00:03:25.690> also<00:03:26.050> broke<00:03:26.350> here<00:03:26.850> and<00:03:28.440> the

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
the spring was also broke here and the

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.199 
the spring was also broke here and the
piece<00:03:29.680> had<00:03:29.890> actually<00:03:30.280> fallen<00:03:30.580> out<00:03:30.910> of<00:03:30.940> this

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
piece had actually fallen out of this

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:34.979 
piece had actually fallen out of this
one<00:03:31.500> so<00:03:32.500> it's<00:03:32.890> gone<00:03:33.120> I'm<00:03:34.120> like<00:03:34.390> these<00:03:34.600> here

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
one so it's gone I'm like these here

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:39.150 
one so it's gone I'm like these here
which<00:03:35.350> managed<00:03:36.100> to<00:03:36.250> stay<00:03:36.489> in<00:03:36.580> place<00:03:37.890> this<00:03:38.890> one

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
which managed to stay in place this one

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.699 
which managed to stay in place this one
here<00:03:39.660> this<00:03:40.660> one<00:03:40.720> the<00:03:40.989> spring<00:03:41.260> was<00:03:41.410> still

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
here this one the spring was still

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.610 
here this one the spring was still
intact<00:03:42.160> but<00:03:42.970> you<00:03:43.120> can<00:03:43.300> see<00:03:43.450> it<00:03:43.570> was<00:03:43.690> rusted<00:03:44.260> and

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
intact but you can see it was rusted and

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.460 
intact but you can see it was rusted and
cns<00:03:45.400> all<00:03:45.580> the<00:03:45.760> other<00:03:45.880> three<00:03:46.239> had<00:03:46.390> broke<00:03:46.660> this

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
cns all the other three had broke this

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.199 
cns all the other three had broke this
one<00:03:47.650> was<00:03:47.830> probably<00:03:48.040> on<00:03:48.310> its<00:03:48.340> way<00:03:48.489> too<00:03:48.640> so<00:03:49.090> we

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
one was probably on its way too so we

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:51.560 
one was probably on its way too so we
just<00:03:49.360> went<00:03:49.510> ahead<00:03:49.660> and<00:03:49.840> replaced<00:03:49.959> all<00:03:50.380> four

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
just went ahead and replaced all four

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.420 
just went ahead and replaced all four
and<00:03:52.570> it<00:03:52.750> is<00:03:52.870> a<00:03:52.900> completely<00:03:53.380> silent<00:03:53.769> ride<00:03:54.160> now

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
and it is a completely silent ride now

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.160 
and it is a completely silent ride now
rides<00:03:55.360> like<00:03:55.600> new

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
rides like new

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.030 
rides like new
it's<00:03:56.830> got<00:03:57.420> 225,000<00:03:58.420> on<00:03:58.570> it<00:03:58.720> and<00:03:59.050> as<00:03:59.620> far<00:03:59.800> as<00:03:59.860> I

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
it's got 225,000 on it and as far as I

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.820 
it's got 225,000 on it and as far as I
know<00:04:00.100> those<00:04:00.489> are<00:04:01.140> struts<00:04:02.140> themselves<00:04:02.650> might

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:02.830 
know those are struts themselves might

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.140 
know those are struts themselves might
not<00:04:03.010> be<00:04:03.160> original<00:04:03.550> so<00:04:03.700> you<00:04:03.760> can<00:04:03.880> see<00:04:04.030> that

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
not be original so you can see that

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.540 
not be original so you can see that
little<00:04:04.300> paint<00:04:04.600> mark<00:04:04.900> on<00:04:05.080> that<00:04:05.230> one<00:04:05.550> but

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:06.550 
little paint mark on that one but

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.930 
little paint mark on that one but
Springs<00:04:07.510> as<00:04:07.989> far<00:04:08.230> as<00:04:08.350> I'm<00:04:08.500> concerned<00:04:08.950> they

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
Springs as far as I'm concerned they

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.860 
Springs as far as I'm concerned they
look<00:04:10.150> to<00:04:10.269> be<00:04:10.360> the<00:04:10.510> original<00:04:10.570> ones<00:04:11.280> so<00:04:12.870> total

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
look to be the original ones so total

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.330 
look to be the original ones so total
for<00:04:14.230> parts

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
for parts

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.340 
for parts
I<00:04:15.370> think<00:04:16.000> all<00:04:16.269> the<00:04:16.359> parts<00:04:16.630> for<00:04:16.810> this<00:04:16.900> was<00:04:17.109> about

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
I think all the parts for this was about

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.560 
I think all the parts for this was about
four<00:04:17.620> hundred<00:04:17.769> five<00:04:18.130> hundred<00:04:18.190> dollars<00:04:18.790> and<00:04:19.060> it

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
four hundred five hundred dollars and it

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.960 
four hundred five hundred dollars and it
made<00:04:19.720> the<00:04:19.840> car<00:04:20.019> ride<00:04:20.260> like<00:04:20.470> new<00:04:20.709> so<00:04:21.130> well<00:04:21.820> worth

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
made the car ride like new so well worth

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.400 
made the car ride like new so well worth
it<00:04:22.210> ready<00:04:22.450> for<00:04:22.510> another<00:04:22.840> two<00:04:23.140> hundred

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
it ready for another two hundred

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.370 
it ready for another two hundred
twenty-five<00:04:23.680> thousand
