ensure proper registration the machine
is<00:00:45.540> loading<00:00:46.080> yellow<00:00:46.710> as<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.460> first<00:00:47.670> color<00:00:48.000> we

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
is loading yellow as the first color we

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.540 
is loading yellow as the first color we
start<00:00:48.690> from<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.080> lightest<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:49.739> then<00:00:49.920> move<00:00:50.100> to

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
start from the lightest and then move to

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.870 
start from the lightest and then move to
the<00:00:50.670> darkest<00:00:51.150> now<00:00:52.050> we<00:00:52.110> see<00:00:52.590> magenta<00:00:53.160> being

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:53.880 
the darkest now we see magenta being

00:00:53.880 --> 00:01:02.119 
the darkest now we see magenta being
applied<00:00:59.000> after<00:01:00.000> magenta<00:01:00.570> we<00:01:01.530> now<00:01:01.680> seeing<00:01:01.980> the

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
applied after magenta we now seeing the

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.939 
applied after magenta we now seeing the
cyan<00:01:02.550> being<00:01:02.940> applied<00:01:03.290> so<00:01:04.290> first<00:01:04.530> we<00:01:04.769> had

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
cyan being applied so first we had

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.970 
cyan being applied so first we had
yellow<00:01:05.370> magenta<00:01:05.730> cyan<00:01:06.530> we<00:01:07.530> can<00:01:07.680> see<00:01:07.860> the

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:07.980 
yellow magenta cyan we can see the

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.240 
yellow magenta cyan we can see the
mixing<00:01:08.310> of<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.520> colors<00:01:09.860> getting<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:10.980> four

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
mixing of the colors getting the four

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.149 
mixing of the colors getting the four
color<00:01:11.460> process<00:01:11.820> look<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.659> then<00:01:13.620> finally<00:01:14.010> the

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
color process look and then finally the

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.450 
color process look and then finally the
key<00:01:14.370> color<00:01:14.670> which<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:15.420> black<00:01:15.870> hence<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.950> K<00:01:17.159> in

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
key color which is black hence the K in

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.370 
key color which is black hence the K in
CMYK<00:01:18.620> k<00:01:19.620> being<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.730> key<00:01:20.940> color<00:01:21.180> of<00:01:21.480> black<00:01:21.840> this

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
CMYK k being the key color of black this

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.890 
CMYK k being the key color of black this
really<00:01:22.740> makes<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.190> sticker<00:01:23.729> pop<00:01:26.600> at<00:01:27.600> full

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
really makes the sticker pop at full

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.800 
really makes the sticker pop at full
speed<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.920> machine<00:01:29.340> moves<00:01:29.670> too<00:01:30.090> quickly<00:01:30.450> for

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
speed the machine moves too quickly for

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.430 
speed the machine moves too quickly for
the<00:01:30.930> human<00:01:31.260> eye<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.740> check<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.460> registration

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
the human eye to check the registration

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.650 
the human eye to check the registration
so<00:01:34.440> we<00:01:34.620> use<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.800> computer<00:01:35.040> in<00:01:35.640> order<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.230> see<00:01:37.250> the

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:38.660 
so we use a computer in order to see the

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.140 
so we use a computer in order to see the
registration<00:01:39.660> the<00:01:39.930> flash<00:01:40.590> stops<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.820> image

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
registration the flash stops the image

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.620 
registration the flash stops the image
so<00:01:42.870> that<00:01:42.900> we<00:01:43.020> can<00:01:43.260> check<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.650> registration

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
so that we can check the registration

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.600 
so that we can check the registration
here<00:01:45.630> we<00:01:45.840> see<00:01:46.050> the<00:01:46.200> excess<00:01:46.770> material<00:01:47.010> being

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
here we see the excess material being

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.010 
here we see the excess material being
removed<00:01:47.910> in<00:01:48.420> between<00:01:48.920> each<00:01:49.920> of<00:01:49.980> the<00:01:50.370> labels

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
removed in between each of the labels

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.050 
removed in between each of the labels
the<00:01:52.020> labels<00:01:52.050> are<00:01:52.500> then<00:01:52.650> dried<00:01:53.010> and<00:01:53.310> spooled<00:01:53.880> at

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
the labels are then dried and spooled at

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.510 
the labels are then dried and spooled at
the<00:01:54.180> end<00:01:54.360> of<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.630> machine

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
the end of the machine

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.270 
the end of the machine
they<00:01:56.520> are<00:01:56.580> also<00:01:56.900> split<00:01:57.900> into<00:01:58.290> roles<00:01:58.680> of<00:01:59.010> a

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
they are also split into roles of a

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.830 
they are also split into roles of a
thousand<00:02:01.670> these<00:02:02.670> are<00:02:02.880> taken<00:02:03.180> off<00:02:03.330> the<00:02:03.480> machine

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
thousand these are taken off the machine

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.010 
thousand these are taken off the machine
and<00:02:04.080> sent<00:02:04.410> over<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:05.160> shipping<00:02:05.580> department

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
and sent over to the shipping department

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.869 
and sent over to the shipping department
but<00:02:07.020> before<00:02:07.380> anything<00:02:07.620> is<00:02:07.830> shipped<00:02:08.129> one<00:02:08.459> final

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
but before anything is shipped one final

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.580 
but before anything is shipped one final
inspection<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:09.629> make<00:02:09.660> sure<00:02:09.810> everything<00:02:10.470> is

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
inspection to make sure everything is

inspection to make sure everything is
perfect
