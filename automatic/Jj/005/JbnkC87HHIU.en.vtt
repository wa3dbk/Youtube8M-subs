00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
so today we have built a Rubik's Cube

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.300 
so today we have built a Rubik's Cube
mosaic<00:01:53.860> of<00:01:54.100> Dean<00:01:54.460> Kamen's<00:01:54.820> face<00:01:55.270> out<00:01:55.960> of<00:01:56.200> 225<00:01:56.980> X

mosaic of Dean Kamen's face out of 225 X

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.610 
mosaic of Dean Kamen's face out of 225 X
cubes<00:01:57.640> in<00:01:57.790> a<00:01:57.880> 15<00:01:58.240> by<00:01:58.390> 15<00:01:58.450> grid<00:01:59.020> and<00:01:59.320> we're<00:01:59.470> doing

00:01:59.610 --> 00:01:59.620 
cubes in a 15 by 15 grid and we're doing

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.920 
cubes in a 15 by 15 grid and we're doing
this<00:01:59.950> because<00:02:00.250> of<00:02:00.820> many<00:02:01.480> of<00:02:01.570> our<00:02:01.690> team<00:02:01.900> members

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930

this because of many of our team members
enjoy<00:02:02.920> solving<00:02:03.370> Rubik's<00:02:03.610> cubes<00:02:04.120> and<00:02:04.240> we

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
enjoy solving Rubik's cubes and we

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.690 
enjoy solving Rubik's cubes and we
thought<00:02:04.630> this<00:02:04.810> would<00:02:04.870> be<00:02:05.110> a<00:02:05.140> good<00:02:05.350> way<00:02:05.530> to<00:02:05.890> kind
