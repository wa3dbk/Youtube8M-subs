00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
from multiple players but that was the

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.459

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
main goal of slide 2.0 was to really

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.920 
main goal of slide 2.0 was to really
elongate<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.070> slide<00:00:50.340> yeah<00:00:51.090> I<00:00:51.120> mean<00:00:51.360> as<00:00:51.539> a

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
elongate the slide yeah I mean as a

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.170 
elongate the slide yeah I mean as a
goalie<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.829> know<00:00:52.949> for<00:00:53.489> roller<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:53.910> have<00:00:54.030> to

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
goalie you know for roller you have to

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.360 
goalie you know for roller you have to
work<00:00:54.420> probably<00:00:55.020> two<00:00:55.230> times<00:00:55.440> as<00:00:55.770> hard<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.250> go

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
work probably two times as hard to go

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.209 
work probably two times as hard to go
half<00:00:56.670> as<00:00:56.879> far<00:00:57.149> than<00:00:58.050> an<00:00:58.170> ice<00:00:58.289> hockey<00:00:58.500> goalie<00:00:58.859> so

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
half as far than an ice hockey goalie so

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.490 
half as far than an ice hockey goalie so
having<00:00:59.850> that<00:00:59.969> extra<00:01:00.300> slide<00:01:00.629> is<00:01:00.930> really

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
having that extra slide is really

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.640 
having that extra slide is really
important<00:01:02.039> I<00:01:02.910> see<00:01:03.870> that<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.110> boot<00:01:04.409> is<00:01:04.619> a

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
important I see that the boot is a

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.140 
important I see that the boot is a
little<00:01:04.979> different<00:01:05.309> as<00:01:05.369> well<00:01:05.519> what<00:01:06.030> do<00:01:06.090> you

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
little different as well what do you

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.789 
little different as well what do you
guys<00:01:06.270> do<00:01:06.450> with<00:01:06.540> that<00:01:06.720> so<00:01:07.260> some<00:01:07.439> of<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.590> things

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
guys do with that so some of the things

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.500 
guys do with that so some of the things
that<00:01:07.979> we<00:01:08.070> did<00:01:08.189> with<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.430> boot<00:01:08.610> this<00:01:08.760> year<00:01:09.000> was

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
that we did with the boot this year was

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.080 
that we did with the boot this year was
increased<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:09.990> taper<00:01:10.290> subtly<00:01:11.070> we<00:01:11.880> have<00:01:12.060> a

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
increased to taper subtly we have a

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.359 
increased to taper subtly we have a
tapered<00:01:12.600> toe<00:01:12.869> that's<00:01:13.710> featured<00:01:14.130> on<00:01:14.280> the

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
tapered toe that's featured on the

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.770 
tapered toe that's featured on the
inside<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.850> pad<00:01:15.000> here<00:01:15.240> for<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.450> goalies

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
inside of the pad here for the goalies

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.830 
inside of the pad here for the goalies
what<00:01:16.380> this<00:01:16.560> does<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:17.159> decreases<00:01:18.150> that<00:01:18.180> toed

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
what this does it decreases that toed

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.350 
what this does it decreases that toed
pad<00:01:19.409> drag<00:01:19.860> that<00:01:20.070> we<00:01:20.189> talked<00:01:20.460> about<00:01:20.610> allowing

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
pad drag that we talked about allowing

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.539 
pad drag that we talked about allowing
the<00:01:21.840> goalies<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.350> really<00:01:22.650> get<00:01:22.830> on<00:01:22.979> their<00:01:23.159> angle

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
the goalies to really get on their angle

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.179 
the goalies to really get on their angle
without<00:01:24.299> slipping<00:01:24.689> out<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.619> really<00:01:25.920> allowing

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
without slipping out and really allowing

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.950 
without slipping out and really allowing
them<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.520> have<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:26.850> extra<00:01:27.000> push<00:01:27.390> off<00:01:27.630> so<00:01:27.810> that

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
them to have that extra push off so that

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.899 
them to have that extra push off so that
they<00:01:28.080> can<00:01:28.259> maintain<00:01:28.439> that<00:01:28.710> slide<00:01:29.220> yeah

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
they can maintain that slide yeah

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.550 
they can maintain that slide yeah
throughout<00:01:30.299> their<00:01:30.450> saves<00:01:30.659> that's<00:01:31.259> super

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
throughout their saves that's super

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.230 
throughout their saves that's super
important<00:01:31.950> because<00:01:32.070> I<00:01:32.280> mean<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.820> can<00:01:32.970> use<00:01:33.119> the

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
so having a little bit of a taper to it

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.289 
so having a little bit of a taper to it
will<00:01:44.009> try<00:01:44.189> and<00:01:44.220> prevent<00:01:44.520> that<00:01:44.640> which<00:01:45.000> will<00:01:45.180> be

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
will try and prevent that which will be

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.120 
will try and prevent that which will be
nice<00:01:45.450> so<00:01:45.869> down<00:01:46.049> another<00:01:46.290> new<00:01:46.530> feature<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:47.009> our

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
nice so down another new feature to our

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.740 
nice so down another new feature to our
pad<00:01:47.310> this<00:01:47.490> year<00:01:47.729> would<00:01:47.909> be<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.060> updated<00:01:48.600> knee

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
pad this year would be the updated knee

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.109 
pad this year would be the updated knee
cradle<00:01:48.990> we've<00:01:49.680> used<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:49.979> pro<00:01:50.159> EBA<00:01:50.490> foam<00:01:50.850> on

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
cradle we've used the pro EBA foam on

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.760 
cradle we've used the pro EBA foam on
this<00:01:51.509> a<00:01:51.570> knee<00:01:51.750> cradle<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.200> really<00:01:52.439> beefed<00:01:52.649> it

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
this a knee cradle to really beefed it

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.190 
this a knee cradle to really beefed it
up<00:01:52.920> perhaps<00:01:53.399> you<00:01:53.670> can<00:01:53.850> explain<00:01:54.360> why<00:01:54.630> having<00:01:55.110> a

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
up perhaps you can explain why having a

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.740 
up perhaps you can explain why having a
beefed<00:01:55.560> up<00:01:55.770> knee<00:01:56.040> pad<00:01:56.250> could<00:01:56.549> really<00:01:56.759> help<00:01:57.509> and

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
beefed up knee pad could really help and

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.780 
beefed up knee pad could really help and
provide<00:01:58.710> an<00:01:58.829> advantage<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.490> goalie

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
provide an advantage to the goalie

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.020 
provide an advantage to the goalie
yeah<00:02:00.180> I<00:02:00.210> mean<00:02:00.450> for<00:02:01.409> roller<00:02:01.619> goalies<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.700> main

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
yeah I mean for roller goalies the main

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.270 
yeah I mean for roller goalies the main
complaint<00:02:03.509> is<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:04.590> hips<00:02:04.829> and<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.100> knees<00:02:05.130> are

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
complaint is the hips and the knees are

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.950 
complaint is the hips and the knees are
first<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.759> go<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:06.180> it's<00:02:06.420> from<00:02:06.570> that<00:02:06.600> impact

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
first to go and it's from that impact

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.469 
first to go and it's from that impact
from<00:02:07.740> having<00:02:08.069> to<00:02:08.160> work<00:02:08.459> so<00:02:08.789> much<00:02:08.910> harder<00:02:08.970> to

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
from having to work so much harder to

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.140 
from having to work so much harder to
try<00:02:09.690> and<00:02:09.810> slide<00:02:10.050> over<00:02:10.410> and<00:02:10.560> do<00:02:11.160> all<00:02:11.280> your<00:02:11.459> moves

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
try and slide over and do all your moves

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.990 
try and slide over and do all your moves
and<00:02:12.680> when<00:02:13.680> you<00:02:13.829> beep<00:02:14.040> up<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.340> new<00:02:14.489> stack<00:02:14.730> that

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
and when you beep up the new stack that

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.640 
and when you beep up the new stack that
really<00:02:15.420> helps<00:02:15.689> with<00:02:15.840> that<00:02:15.989> that's<00:02:16.500> gonna

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
really helps with that that's gonna

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.979 
really helps with that that's gonna
really<00:02:16.950> prevent<00:02:17.909> injuries<00:02:18.360> which<00:02:18.659> is<00:02:18.780> key

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
really prevent injuries which is key

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.080 
really prevent injuries which is key

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
yeah that was mainly our goal this time

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.780 
yeah that was mainly our goal this time
when<00:02:21.540> we<00:02:21.659> were<00:02:21.810> addressing<00:02:22.709> that<00:02:23.010> part<00:02:23.700> of

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
when we were addressing that part of

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.699 
when we were addressing that part of

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
that pad absolutely and I noticed you

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.119 
that pad absolutely and I noticed you
have<00:02:25.799> a<00:02:25.829> front<00:02:26.220> face<00:02:26.700> design<00:02:27.060> here<00:02:27.950> you<00:02:28.950> tell

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
me a little bit about that yeah

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.179 
me a little bit about that yeah
definitely<00:02:30.359> so<00:02:30.930> this<00:02:31.500> year<00:02:31.680> we<00:02:31.769> also<00:02:31.799> wanted

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:32.189

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:33.830 
definitely so this year we also wanted
to<00:02:32.250> make<00:02:32.340> sure<00:02:32.549> we<00:02:32.700> had<00:02:32.819> a<00:02:32.849> flat<00:02:33.180> face<00:02:33.420> design

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
to make sure we had a flat face design

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.080 
to make sure we had a flat face design
really<00:02:34.620> helps<00:02:34.890> goalies<00:02:35.519> control<00:02:35.909> those

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
really helps goalies control those

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.830 
really helps goalies control those
rebounds<00:02:37.189> we<00:02:38.189> wanted<00:02:38.519> to<00:02:38.670> evolve<00:02:39.269> our<00:02:39.540> pad

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
rebounds we wanted to evolve our pad

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.229 
rebounds we wanted to evolve our pad
look<00:02:40.260> in<00:02:40.470> shape<00:02:40.739> and<00:02:40.920> feel<00:02:41.129> it<00:02:41.670> really<00:02:41.939> allows

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
look in shape and feel it really allows

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:43.670 
look in shape and feel it really allows
for<00:02:42.540> the<00:02:42.629> player<00:02:42.870> to<00:02:43.049> feel<00:02:43.230> like<00:02:43.409> he<00:02:43.530> has<00:02:43.650> a

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
for the player to feel like he has a

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.089 
for the player to feel like he has a
more<00:02:44.090> sturdy<00:02:45.090> product<00:02:45.720> on<00:02:45.900> his<00:02:46.049> legs<00:02:46.349> to

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
more sturdy product on his legs to

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:48.500 
more sturdy product on his legs to
really<00:02:47.310> allow<00:02:47.549> them<00:02:47.730> to<00:02:47.909> elongate<00:02:48.329> their

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
really allow them to elongate their

really allow them to elongate their
slide<00:02:48.980> absolutely<00:02:49.980> yeah<00:02:50.099> the<00:02:50.459> rebound

slide absolutely yeah the rebound

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.270 
slide absolutely yeah the rebound
control<00:02:51.209> is<00:02:51.329> key<00:02:51.569> because<00:02:52.019> obviously<00:02:52.859> as<00:02:53.250> a

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280
