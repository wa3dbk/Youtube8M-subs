00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:15.990
 hi are hypercubes welcome to this 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.790
 new video new series new everything 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.230
 also new microphone I hope you hear 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.790
 very much unlike quality 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.730
 audio is thrown away of money 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:26.759
 today we talk about planetside 2 are not 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.939
 the first to do it but we will enter one 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:33.750
 tutorial series gameplay guides 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.770
 in short, to do a bit of bearing from 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.040
 here at battlefield 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.980
 four the main games I will cover 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.340
 they will always be those of the saga of die 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:47.760
 of battlefield however it beats v3 a game a 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.450
 let's say not passed but why 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.920
 charity we are still all playing but 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.330
 begins to have a little less appeal force 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.160
 also in terms of driving etc. 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:59.400
 while I saw that planets that a game 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:03.150
 there are few wonderful and little treated 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:05.430
 in-depth tutorial tutorial tactics 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:08.460
 on how to shoot how to move how to do 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.290
 we will therefore discuss them here on hyper 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.659
 gaming cube let's start with an overview 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.330
 today in the first episode on planetside 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.090
 price side and a free to play you can 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.610
 download it by registering on the site that 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.860
 I put you in the description and a free 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.470
 to play however equipped with a graphic one 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.380
 beautiful reach from the ford light engine 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.890
 issued November 20, 2012 after a 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:36.060
 year and a half of beta testing and a mmo 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.830
 fps which is a fps but mass online 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.900
 ie substantially instead of having a 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.720
 classic game in multiple with analyze 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.780
 server and 24 64 players as in the 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.870
 case of battlefield we have challenges between 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:52.020
 really hundreds of players this 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:54.090
 because there are mega servers for 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.850
 example the one where I play is ceres on the 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:00.090
 european server ceres 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.710
 which contain lots of players 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.840
 also the thing that characterizes 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.009
 planetside as a multiplayer of 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.140
 mass and that the bat 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.060
 the battle never ends is not one 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.130
 winning game ok start of shift 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.080
 one hundred ticket finished the shift 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.090
 no it is a war that goes on day and 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.010
 night continuously and always 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.860
 we say a continuity and how to have 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:23.390
 a second life on planetside and this 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:26.400
 it's really trendy in trip than one thing 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:29.040
 pianezza the two is set on aura csis 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.170
 a huge planet that is consumed by 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.790
 an incessant war between three factions that 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.980
 I am the terrestrial republic 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.510
 sovereignty bano and the new conglomerate 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.420
 I created a character from the 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.580
 terrestrial republic each faction 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.050
 different ideals different philosophies but of 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.370
 this absolutely does not give a damn 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.470
 nothing 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.549
 let's try to give an over plus 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:52.860
 on the planetside game mechanics 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:57.019
 there are three continents that are the samirs 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:03:00.209
 linder and america all three enormous 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:02.850
 to make you understand such a continent will be 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:05.250
 ten times operation firestorm of blatt 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:08.340
 stones and each and every one of them 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.560
 continents and characterized by note 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.810
 vast vast territory and structures 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.209
 structures are the biggest ones we say 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.940
 they are called world i hate are the bases 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:21.480
 every world gets there are three for each 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:24.600
 continent each one belonging to each one 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:27.530
 of the three factions are reserved as 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:30.180
 based precisely on a single species 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.459
 example we are of the terrestrial republic 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.859
 we wired gate ivano ei 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:38.690
 conglomerates cannot enter 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:41.000
 inside the world gate snow the flights 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.980
 we are nothing infantry vehicles 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.600
 completely safe then there is one 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.640
 series of other structures that are instead 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:49.010
 at the mercy of the war we must 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:52.280
 conquering ourselves will conquer them 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:54.620
 through the stationing near of 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.960
 checkpoint hot spot flag 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.940
 call of how you want and more are there 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.670
 a series of type generators 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:04.100
 different we have to deactivate e 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.510
 reactivate defend attack in base 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.580
 to the game situation but these are 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.470
 all things we will see in detail 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.140
 of the next episodes 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:14.270
 to conclude this overview let's talk 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.980
 some vehicle class vehicles 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:19.549
 above all they can be earthy 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:21.350
 are quads there are tanks driven by a 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:24.890
 only players so driven by more 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:26.570
 players there are aircraft also gods 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:28.280
 classic hunting 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.020
 if we were in battlefield ok they are gods 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.810
 vehicles that can drive in symbol 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.910
 otherwise there are mega gods 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:37.610
 spaceships we can drive in twelve 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:40.370
 the nocesi always drive alone ok though 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:43.280
 we can carry maybe 12 people 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:45.250
 so it's really huge 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:50.030
 so we have vehicles both on land and 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:52.190
 There are also air of the classes 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.320
 classes have infiltrated that a sniper 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.720
 that the assault can become invisible 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.870
 light and heavy on- state assault 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.250
 light can say fly for a total of 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.580
 seconds until the energy runs out 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:06.970
 the heavy assault on rockets to a suit 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:09.140
 protective that is always activated 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.880
 exploiting energy then there is the 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:13.880
 engineer who can repair vehicles and 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:16.100
 leave ammo ammunition kits 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:18.710
 the combat doctor who treats the 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:21.610
 comrades and revives them and the max that is a 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:24.260
 mega soldier nor with huge armor 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:27.169
 well the interesting thing that these 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:28.250
 classes are based on the fact that of the 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:30.460
 new technologies 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:32.259
 on this planet will have csis 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:35.080
 in the case of nanotechnologies 

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:40.599
 have made the development of weapons possible 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:43.449
 and of armor based precisely on the dwarf 

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:45.460
 fabrics less fabrics that allow this 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:48.639
 of weapons practically of the super channels 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:50.620
 rather than jumpsuits 

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:53.199
 with the particular powers I have 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.220
 described describing the classes in 

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:56.590
 plein 6 2 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:59.470
 the nice thing besides we say to the graphics 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:02.410
 really pleasant and the mechanism of 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:04.780
 game that is very much based on 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:06.520
 team there are the possibility of 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:08.530
 create teams to create 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.479
 outfit there is a voice chat that works 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:11.440
 very well think of one of my first 

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:14.440
 games 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:16.060
 an English boy started talking 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:19.120
 telling us what we would find ourselves 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:21.460
 in front of the outpost saying of 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:24.340
 beware of the many enemies he gave us 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:28.449
 good luck 

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:28.449
 spores and tex germs 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.350
 dear mega 

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:53.240
 and very much social as I play and believe 

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:55.820
 that in Italy it is treated as well as in 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:57.350
 a bit superficially we say it is not 

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:59.630
 a lot of credit precisely because 

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:01.160
 in planetside the problem is that if 

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:04.880
 we enter alone without having known 

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:06.740
 no one in the game because 

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:08.960
 it is not a game but a 

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:11.300
 game that is running on that server in 

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:13.880
 so continued we may well not 

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:16.910
 absolutely understand a stone because it is 

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:19.430
 very very complicated in the next 

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:21.520
 episodes we will see in order how to proceed 

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:24.129
 how to marry like 

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:26.229
 where to be reborn because what are i 

00:07:24.129 --> 00:07:28.090
 our goals how to unlock weapons 

00:07:26.229 --> 00:07:30.129
 what are the vehicles 

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:32.080
 etcetera etc. etc. we will see a little 

00:07:30.129 --> 00:07:35.050
 all the mechanisms of this game that 

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:37.360
 will take us to battlefield 4 s and up 

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:39.879
 you want to play with me with us 

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:41.199
 I remind you that I created a forum that 

00:07:39.879 --> 00:07:43.449
 also a clan 

00:07:41.199 --> 00:07:45.400
 for now we are not competitive 

00:07:43.449 --> 00:07:46.599
 I also ask you occasionally about them 

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:49.470
 come on them only if you are 

00:07:46.599 --> 00:07:51.970
 really interested in playing by 

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:55.030
 cooperative the game ok we do not want 

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:56.530
 haters as they say but there 

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:57.699
 we have so much fun is a game that is 

00:07:56.530 --> 00:08:01.419
 played alone does not have absolutely 

00:07:57.699 --> 00:08:04.509
 meaning never played in 6 7 8 10 thousand 

00:08:01.419 --> 00:08:07.740
 people definitely take shape e 

00:08:04.509 --> 00:08:09.699
 takes a much more meaningful meaning 

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:11.440
 marked then see you next 

00:08:09.699 --> 00:08:14.220
 video comment and vote if you want 

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:14.220
