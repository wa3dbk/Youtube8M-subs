and<00:01:55.550> anyway<00:01:56.550> fixing<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:56.910> boiling<00:01:57.210> some<00:01:57.360> water

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
and anyway fixing to boiling some water

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.660 
and anyway fixing to boiling some water
the<00:01:58.260> process<00:01:58.680> of<00:01:58.800> that<00:02:01.160> fire<00:02:02.160> is<00:02:02.310> going<00:02:02.490> pretty

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
the process of that fire is going pretty

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.820 
the process of that fire is going pretty
good<00:02:02.970> you<00:02:03.840> can<00:02:03.930> open<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.200> damper<00:02:04.500> up<00:02:04.590> a<00:02:04.680> little

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
good you can open the damper up a little

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.859 
good you can open the damper up a little
bit<00:02:04.979> more<00:02:06.500> and<00:02:08.240> just<00:02:09.240> show<00:02:09.479> you<00:02:09.510> what<00:02:09.690> it<00:02:09.720> kind

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
bit more and just show you what it kind

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:15.320 
bit more and just show you what it kind
of<00:02:09.959> looks<00:02:10.170> like<00:02:10.260> inside

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.820 

so<00:02:15.840> guess<00:02:15.990> I<00:02:16.080> like<00:02:16.290> a<00:02:16.320> jet<00:02:17.160> airplane

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.979 

but<00:02:20.460> to<00:02:20.610> go<00:02:20.730> far<00:02:21.000> our<00:02:21.210> small<00:02:21.480> firebox

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.539 

furnace<00:02:26.989> just<00:02:27.079> Willow<00:02:27.590> lambs<00:02:27.859> and<00:02:28.099> stuff<00:02:28.340> that

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:28.549 
furnace just Willow lambs and stuff that

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:34.089 
furnace just Willow lambs and stuff that
I<00:02:30.579> broke<00:02:31.579> with<00:02:31.700> my<00:02:31.849> hands<00:02:32.239> and<00:02:32.950> some<00:02:33.950> little

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
I broke with my hands and some little

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:35.770 
I broke with my hands and some little
simple<00:02:34.489> stuff<00:02:34.730> I<00:02:35.090> don't<00:02:35.359> really<00:02:35.540> need<00:02:35.689> to

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
simple stuff I don't really need to

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.530 
simple stuff I don't really need to
solve<00:02:36.019> for<00:02:36.109> this<00:02:36.290> type<00:02:36.530> of<00:02:36.560> stuff<00:02:37.359> let's<00:02:38.359> see

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
solve for this type of stuff let's see

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.979 
solve for this type of stuff let's see
if<00:02:38.659> the<00:02:38.810> waters<00:02:39.319> do<00:02:39.500> anything<00:02:39.829> yet<00:02:40.989> it's

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
if the waters do anything yet it's

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:43.449 
if the waters do anything yet it's
getting<00:02:42.260> a<00:02:42.290> little<00:02:42.379> warm<00:02:42.590> I<00:02:42.769> just<00:02:42.980> fired<00:02:43.189> that

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
getting a little warm I just fired that

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:52.479 
getting a little warm I just fired that
not<00:02:43.639> too<00:02:43.760> long<00:02:43.939> ago<00:02:46.780> and<00:02:50.980> reason<00:02:51.980> why<00:02:52.069> with<00:02:52.400> the

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
not too long ago and reason why with the

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:56.229 
not too long ago and reason why with the
stove<00:02:52.760> is<00:02:52.939> because<00:02:53.269> I<00:02:54.129> saw<00:02:55.129> a<00:02:55.159> little<00:02:55.430> article

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
stove is because I saw a little article

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.849 
stove is because I saw a little article
that<00:02:56.269> Turk<00:02:56.900> on<00:02:57.169> from<00:02:57.530> Canada<00:02:57.889> had<00:02:58.040> wrote<00:02:58.250> and

00:02:59.849 --> 00:02:59.859 
that Turk on from Canada had wrote and

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:03.970 
that Turk on from Canada had wrote and
anyway<00:03:00.859> after<00:03:01.189> reading<00:03:01.370> it<00:03:01.549> I<00:03:02.769> thought<00:03:03.769> this

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
anyway after reading it I thought this

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.199 
anyway after reading it I thought this
was<00:03:04.129> a<00:03:04.159> stove<00:03:04.459> for<00:03:04.609> me<00:03:04.760> so<00:03:05.500> thank<00:03:06.500> you<00:03:06.590> Turk<00:03:06.799> for

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
was a stove for me so thank you Turk for

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:10.659 
was a stove for me so thank you Turk for

does a pretty good job reason why I got
the<00:04:11.239> pipes<00:04:11.450> along<00:04:11.780> is<00:04:11.959> because<00:04:11.989> I<00:04:12.290> built<00:04:12.470> the

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
the pipes along is because I built the

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.010 
the pipes along is because I built the
TP<00:04:12.950> a<00:04:13.209> couple<00:04:14.209> of<00:04:14.270> years<00:04:14.420> ago<00:04:14.569> and<00:04:14.840> that's

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:15.020 
TP a couple of years ago and that's

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.870 
TP a couple of years ago and that's
reason<00:04:15.319> I<00:04:15.440> bought<00:04:15.950> this<00:04:16.160> stove<00:04:16.430> was<00:04:16.609> for<00:04:16.790> the

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
reason I bought this stove was for the

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.319 
reason I bought this stove was for the
cheapy<00:04:17.269> and<00:04:17.510> I<00:04:17.570> needed<00:04:17.810> a<00:04:17.900> set<00:04:18.320> length<00:04:18.650> for<00:04:18.950> the

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
cheapy and I needed a set length for the

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:22.690 
cheapy and I needed a set length for the
TP<00:04:20.329> anyway<00:04:20.930> I<00:04:21.010> don't<00:04:22.010> really<00:04:22.220> want<00:04:22.400> to<00:04:22.460> cut<00:04:22.610> it

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
TP anyway I don't really want to cut it

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.570 
TP anyway I don't really want to cut it
