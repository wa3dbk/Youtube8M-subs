trying to get across here is that the
one<00:04:13.890> plus<00:04:14.070> one<00:04:14.130> performs<00:04:14.790> to<00:04:14.970> a<00:04:15.000> standard<00:04:15.510> so

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
one plus one performs to a standard so

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.320 
one plus one performs to a standard so
much<00:04:16.200> ahead<00:04:16.650> of<00:04:16.859> its<00:04:17.070> price<00:04:17.370> tag<00:04:17.640> so<00:04:18.150> now<00:04:18.269> we
