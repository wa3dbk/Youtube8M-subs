bounced<00:02:10.170> around<00:02:10.890> everywhere<00:02:11.600> but<00:02:12.600> just<00:02:12.840> about

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
bounced around everywhere but just about

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.150 
bounced around everywhere but just about
anything<00:02:13.350> on<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:13.709> road

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
anything on the road

I<00:02:14.190> don't<00:02:14.610> trust<00:02:14.820> a<00:02:15.000> car<00:02:15.180> that<00:02:15.360> I<00:02:15.420> can<00:02:15.570> pick<00:02:15.750> up

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
I don't trust a car that I can pick up

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.400 
I don't trust a car that I can pick up
for<00:02:16.380> me<00:02:16.560> it's<00:02:16.860> toss<00:02:17.640> up<00:02:17.880> Prius<00:02:18.270> smart<00:02:18.870> car<00:02:19.140> I

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
for me it's toss up Prius smart car I

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.230 
for me it's toss up Prius smart car I
think<00:02:19.830> this<00:02:20.010> marker<00:02:20.430> is<00:02:20.459> actually<00:02:20.910> smarter

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
think this marker is actually smarter

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.390 
think this marker is actually smarter
than<00:02:21.270> the<00:02:21.480> Prius<00:02:21.780> I<00:02:22.140> think<00:02:22.440> at<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.100> end<00:02:23.220> of<00:02:23.310> the

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
than the Prius I think at the end of the

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.850 
than the Prius I think at the end of the
day<00:02:23.550> I<00:02:24.140> don't<00:02:25.140> like<00:02:25.260> Prius<00:02:25.560> drivers<00:02:25.709> I<00:02:27.860> would

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
day I don't like Prius drivers I would

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.250 
day I don't like Prius drivers I would
say<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.190> only<00:02:29.220> car<00:02:29.640> out<00:02:29.850> there<00:02:30.090> that<00:02:30.300> I<00:02:30.510> really

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
say the only car out there that I really

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.460 
say the only car out there that I really
want<00:02:31.440> to<00:02:31.530> drive<00:02:31.739> and<00:02:32.209> I<00:02:33.209> would<00:02:33.989> do<00:02:34.110> just<00:02:34.380> about

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
want to drive and I would do just about

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.040 
want to drive and I would do just about
anything<00:02:34.950> to<00:02:35.340> make<00:02:35.790> it<00:02:35.820> happen<00:02:36.150> is<00:02:36.510> a<00:02:36.540> Formula

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
anything to make it happen is a Formula

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.070 
anything to make it happen is a Formula
One<00:02:37.080> car<00:02:37.230> unfortunately<00:02:38.100> I'm<00:02:38.940> a<00:02:39.090> tipping<00:02:39.989> the
