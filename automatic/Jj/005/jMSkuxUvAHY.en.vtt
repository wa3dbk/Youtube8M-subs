00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:07.919
 hello eric alberto coach and private 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.230
 coach today I explain to you 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.420
 how to work abs then the 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.429
 simply simply have to know where 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.190
 they are inserted very simply the 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.680
 abs consists of three muscles the 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.689
 big right the little one to the big and the big 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.000
 public so mainly when 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.590
 work the abs we work the 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.810
 great right when working the 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.150
 abdominals are inserted on the 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.489
 last ribs and the sternum and they 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.890
 end up on the basin so the method 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.989
 very simple there are two of them 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.390
 keep the pelvis fixed is to bring closer 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.059
 the sternum of the pelvis or so to keep 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.579
 the fixed sternum is to bring the 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.570
 sternum basin so firstly in 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.640
 supine 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.690
 lie on your back with your feet 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.780
 well grounded 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.629
 jean bent the goal being to have the 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.399
 lower back well grounded next to 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.410
 the position of the hands we have two 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.210
 positions so firstly the soul the 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.620
 hands behind the head hands 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.660
 behind the head are just there for 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.060
 support the head of accor for 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.369
 more knowledgeable people can be placed 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.369
 hands crossed here on the shoulders 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.619
 the movement simply consists of 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:15.659
 take off the shoulder blades of about 30 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.740
 degrees to have a contraction here 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.820
 abdominals 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.299
 so we go down we inspire and on the 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.509
 ascent 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.939
 we're blowing so we're getting closer 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.329
 the sternum of the pelvis we inspire on the 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.729
 descent and blow on the climb 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.920
 so here you can do some 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.110
 exercises a few repetitions so of 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.000
 20 to 30 repetitions to start at 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.740
 feel the first burns so the 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.810
 very important point for this exercise 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.119
 it is to respect 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.159
 the amplitude of work so it takes 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.960
 always that the word flat is peeling off 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.329
 so the shoulder blades come off at least 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.329
 30 degrees otherwise there is no work 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:56.670
 abdominal and finally so points to 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.229
 therefore also respect things not to 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.860
 not doing what's needed especially not 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.630
 to do is to have a hyper pressure on 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.610
 the head when going up ie 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.799
 stick his chin against the chest 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.470
 always well kept his collar 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.080
 is also second thing to never 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.970
 make 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.010
 at his feet under a piece of furniture or to be 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.830
 hold your legs or ankles by 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.930
 another person three things to good 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.510
 retain control of the exercise 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.420
 the positioning of the body and the 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.690
 coordination of breathing with the 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.690
 movement
