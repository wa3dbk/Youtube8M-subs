00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.090
 hello everyone welcome to a new 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.090
 droid 360 video 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.460
 if you are starting in the world of 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.930
 Android or you have been on Android for a while 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.990
 many times you have read the word 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:22.020
 root and you'll wonder what being root is 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:25.110
 root is having privileges have permissions 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.840
 of superuser and be able to use 100% 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.610
 the capacity of your android phone to 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.640
 be your phone and how is yours 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.140
 you'll want to maybe get the most out of it and 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.360
 thus being able to install new 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.220
 applications or do it even in that the 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.449
 terminal go faster among others 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:44.250
 many options that now I will explain 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:45.870
 in this video what advantages does this have? 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.219
 the root some will have to have if this 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.079
 he still loses his time doing 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.809
 a video about being root 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.070
 Well, it has many advantages and 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.410
 then also explain with the 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.879
 disadvantages but the advantages are that 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.339
 the manufacturer's limitations 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:03.210
 disappear that is to say we are the 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:04.710
 that we decided what applications to have and 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.510
 which ones not because as you know some 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.210
 applications come pre-installed in 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.680
 according to which companies and they leave us 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.210
 uninstall this we can do it for 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.820
 example 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.290
 we can also accelerate the processor 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.720
 so that it goes faster we can 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.119
 install applications that need to 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.970
 this being root because touching aspects 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:27.030
 of the phone that do not touch them if not 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.979
 We have full control over it and 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.290
 also because we can always have the 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.119
 updates to the day because what 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.520
 we installed both of them in the same way 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.259
 manual but they're not all flÃ³rez too 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.050
 has some drawbacks of being root 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.570
 for example that the bad tongues run 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.860
 that can leave your terminal fried and 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.110
 use it later as a paperweight 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.450
 this time this is not pose ruth 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.980
 normally it can not happen to you for being 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.360
 route me if you are very low you have the 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.550
 total control over your mobile 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.560
 maybe you could do it but 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.990
 this is usually by changing course not 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:04.190
 you have to confuse being root with 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:06.200
 have another room that is good to have another 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:09.320
 room depends on that root but that run does not 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.230
 is equivalent to having a rom that is something 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.959
 that I will explain now 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.030
 because it's been said they only give you the 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.700
 privileges to do what you want with 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.980
 your phone while having a rice 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.450
 is to change your operating system 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.799
 phone and if you do it badly yes yes that 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.920
 you could get it to load the 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:28.420
 phone in terminal phone tablet the 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.940
 Guarantee theme is a tricky subject 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.489
 in europe at the beginning it can be done 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.980
 root and the warranty covers you and in the case 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.090
 that the phone has a flaw 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:41.019
 provided it was not for this reason 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:44.379
 root or change the rom always 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:46.299
 they will give you support for example if it is a subject 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:48.670
 of hardware and it has nothing to do with 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:51.010
 the software that you have put a 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.560
 phone can be removed before 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.910
 Take it to repair in principle if it is not 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.430
 that has not stopped you from working 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.879
 over the phone 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.950
 and well you run the risk that is going to have 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:05.250
 The guarantee may be affected in 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.769
 principle not in europe but from 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.920
 Here everyone is responsible for what 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:13.490
 it happens to your phone 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:16.220
 is we sacrifice guarantee maybe for a 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:18.260
 little freedom when it comes to driving 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.209
 our android phone or tablet 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.860
 android now I'm going to explain a little 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:24.620
 is this about the rom is he was talking 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:27.350
 during the video the rom are images of the 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.810
 operating system modified or made 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.760
 by cooks people who are called 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.770
 chefs who add new 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.590
 functionalities or you can always have 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:38.360
 a phone or tablet that has not been 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.880
 updated to a version to that version 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.560
 new we can always have our 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.050
 most updated phone with the best 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.090
 benefits and maybe some of them 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:49.220
 are more optimized according to what type 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.140
 of terminals nowadays this router is 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.190
 very easy there are programs that with a 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.959
 just click 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.660
 they make us that our phone is going to 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:59.030
 have superuser permissions and what 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.950
 same goes the other way also uninstall 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.170
 the root could be rooted a phone 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.030
 it is also quite simple not to install 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.920
 so it has a little more 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.780
 difficulty but good if you want more 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.410
 information about this route being some 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.540
 example 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.910
 and how to install a rom leave it in the 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.489
 comments and then I'll make a video 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.890
 installing a rom or doing the process 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.570
 to be root in a specific terminal 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.220
 that's it if you liked the video 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.940
 you doubt that write to you and we see you the 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.940
 next video
