need<00:06:33.009> to<00:06:33.039> do<00:06:33.190> and<00:06:33.370> then<00:06:33.460> we're<00:06:33.610> diving<00:06:33.789> right

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:34.150 
need to do and then we're diving right

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.600 
need to do and then we're diving right
into<00:06:34.330> that<00:06:34.479> DIY<00:06:35.080> suppressor<00:06:35.800> build<00:06:36.010> so<00:06:36.430> that's

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:36.610 
into that DIY suppressor build so that's

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:38.339 
into that DIY suppressor build so that's
going<00:06:36.760> to<00:06:36.820> be<00:06:36.990> machining<00:06:37.990> it's<00:06:38.110> going<00:06:38.229> to<00:06:38.289> be

00:06:38.339 --> 00:06:38.349 
going to be machining it's going to be
