00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:11.860
 how about friends of all android 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:14.740
 welcome to a new video in this what 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.530
 what we are going to do quickly is to see a 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.460
 small analysis taken out of the box 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:21.970
 first removed from the box after 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:25.000
 analysis of a high battery 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:28.510
 capacity an external battery rap power 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.720
 from no less than 14 thousand milliamps a 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:34.329
 piece of bliss battery feature like 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:37.420
 I say the ralph power brand and good 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:40.629
 this analysis and I have taken out of the box is 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:43.899
 thanks to that the ram power brand to the 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:46.989
 website www.renfe.com let's see 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:50.050
 some of its characteristics we take 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:51.900
 quickly from the box and we see what 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.500
 contains 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:59.700
 there is nothing left here 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:02.130
 and here we have the mega battery 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.930
 14,000 thousand empires 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:08.370
 here you have it in white 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.370
 we are the stickers 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:16.550
 good as I say 14,000 thousand amps 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:21.260
 5 volt input 15 amps and output 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:24.200
 2 has two outputs of 5 volts and 1 and 2 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.450
 amps kva we have them here then a 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.040
 of the exits as you see we have 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.630
 we can be loading the devices 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:36.530
 at the same time one of the outputs the second 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:38.270
 a led diode here and as a flashlight and 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.130
 here then the entry for the micro usb 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.560
 for the load of the motion itself 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.380
 characteristics of the battery also in 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.060
 As for measurements it is 127 mm 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:51.480
 high 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:54.660
 76 millimeters wide and thickness 21 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:57.640
 millimeters of weight because of weight is not 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:00.040
 it's bad 282 grams 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.560
 and with this we will have to load a 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.970
 normal mobile because several times and one 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.979
 tablet we can even load it 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.550
 also some of them we can 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:11.310
 load well a couple of times 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.540
 compatible with the series of 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.550
 connectors that brings us compatible 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.459
 to load for all types of android 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:23.410
 HTC Samsung and Motorola 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:26.489
 in short the nexus for also the apple 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:29.230
 ipad and others and good for the nokia and 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:31.600
 I would say that almost all the cell phones that 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:35.560
 there is in the market so with this we are going 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:37.209
 to have extra charge so that we do not 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.980
 there is no place where we go 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.420
 if we do not go to the most lost mountain in the 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.370
 planet Earth 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.780
 then there we will have 14,000 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.390
 milliamps with which to charge several 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.670
 times in the mobile that includes the box 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.790
 part of the battery because our guide 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:55.170
 user a small user guide here 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.170
 we have in all languages 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:02.890
 I'm looking if in Spanish is the 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:05.140
 warranty card here blah blah blah 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.270
 thank you for buying us and apart 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.850
 travel bag that this the truth is that 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.250
 It is quite useful to put the battery 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:16.170
 inside 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:19.500
 in these connectors and the cables we 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.690
 it brings several connectors that we have and 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.400
 as you see it brings all cables 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:27.210
 to connect two devices to it 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:30.090
 time so successfully these two 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:31.450
 cables and these adapters for tablets 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.410
 ipad 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:38.530
 microusb for samsung and android and 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.330
 this also because we will have connectors 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.349
 for all types of devices that 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:49.060
 let's carry mp3 whatever so with this 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:51.040
 It is an accessory for mobile phones 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.750
 the truth is that quite complete super 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.099
 full I would say because with this we do not 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.349
 will do nothing else we do not lack anything 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:58.569
 more let's do in a test loading 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:02.410
 two devices at once we have 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:07.239
 Our Samsung Galaxy S 4 connected to 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:09.010
 the battery and our nexus 10 tablet the 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:10.690
 we have also connected let's go to 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.340
 turn on the battery and let's see what 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.340
 charge the new device at the same time 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:17.290
 we turn on the battery we see here the 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.030
 LEDs that have turned on that this does not 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:22.460
 commented beforehand the button of 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:24.560
 on and here it shows us the 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.050
 several leds 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.310
 with which tells us the time let's say 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.860
 what's left of the load 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:35.160
 to the battery itself I spoke here we have 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:37.050
 our galaxy s 4 and we have it here already 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.840
 you see what is loading is there the 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.720
 symbol 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:44.330
 here we have the little ray in the 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:47.680
 battery that is charging and then in 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.680
 our nexuses 10 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:53.360
 since its 10 then we have here that 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:57.110
 it's good I have matica backhand 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:59.840
 I have upside down as you see here is 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:02.240
 Charging our battery perfectly 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:05.090
 of the nexus 10 that were these 10 can you 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.310
 say that they have a powerful battery the 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:10.879
 battery with enough milliamps and like 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:14.539
 you see then the battery the ram power is 

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:18.379
 of 14,000 milliamps is not afraid 

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:20.870
 to nothing and is directly loading the 

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:22.280
 two the two devices without any 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.289
 problem ok 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:27.680
 so we press the button and we see what 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:30.169
 there are those of the LEDs that he has and we see 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.810
 because it is on and charged if 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:35.060
 we left the button pressed also 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:36.979
 we will have another thing that is flashlight the 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.719
 led diode that we have here opposite 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:41.300
 we'll have it as a flashlight like that 

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:43.969
 Good thing I'm going to tell you the truth 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:46.699
 is that it is one of the most good not what 

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:49.460
 I said but it has a touch of plastic 

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:50.689
 and is reinforced with the grades the 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:53.779
 truth is that it's pretty enough 

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:56.490
 well in terms of design, no, no, no, 

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:58.060
 we want more more than anything that is 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:00.550
 or not 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:03.940
 compact that good that does not weigh much 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:05.710
 for 14,000 milliamps is not bad and 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.240
 the battery then complies with what 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:10.030
 we expect an adequate size or a 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:11.889
 plastic housing but good 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:14.950
 feeling of being very solid and resistant 

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:17.430
 once exhausted battery time 

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:21.280
 load that you have is 15 hours but 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:23.230
 you will say some hosts for 15 hours but it is 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:27.310
 normal because it is 14,000 thousand amps no 

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:29.889
 it's loaded as well as fast and so 

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:31.570
 other then the little bag that we have 

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:33.490
 commented that he brings the travel bag with 

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:35.380
 all the connectors the truth that 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:37.150
 It meets all expectations as 

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:39.370
 to be an accessory that we are going to carry 

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:42.880
 of travel we are going to take from here to 

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:45.000
 there and as I say an accessory for 

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:48.820
 highly recommended mobile devices 

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:51.010
 since we're not going to have a fear in 

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:53.260
 as to lack of battery there where 

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:55.600
 let's be because 14,000 thousand amps gives 

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:57.430
 to give enough downloads and good 

00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:00.220
 friends I hope I do not know what is useful 

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:04.289
 and how good that in your description 

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:06.360
 from ever getting to buy any 

00:07:04.289 --> 00:07:09.419
 some external battery may serve 

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:12.689
 so to have a little bit of ideas like 

00:07:09.419 --> 00:07:14.189
 I say a powerful battery with 14,000 

00:07:12.689 --> 00:07:17.279
 milliamperes the most powerful of those 

00:07:14.189 --> 00:07:21.629
 we analyzed in this YouTube channel 

00:07:17.279 --> 00:07:23.249
 and nothing with this endless battery so 

00:07:21.629 --> 00:07:25.439
 nothing friends 

00:07:23.249 --> 00:07:28.699
 I hope it's useful and we'll see you in a 

00:07:25.439 --> 00:07:28.699
 next video until next time
