00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
the front of the purpose and the back of

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.840 
the front of the purpose and the back of
the<00:01:41.020> purpose<00:01:41.409> okay<00:01:41.890> not<00:01:42.070> just<00:01:42.280> localized<00:01:42.670> to

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
the purpose okay not just localized to

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.420

don't<00:02:51.260> have<00:02:51.380> an<00:02:51.560> extreme<00:02:51.890> case<00:02:52.100> of<00:02:52.340> it<00:02:52.550> and

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
don't have an extreme case of it and

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.670 
don't have an extreme case of it and
both<00:02:53.240> they're<00:02:53.450> definitely<00:02:53.690> just<00:02:54.170> looking<00:02:54.560> at

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
both they're definitely just looking at

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.650 
both they're definitely just looking at
what<00:02:54.830> triggers<00:02:55.160> ish<00:02:55.310> I<00:02:55.490> think<00:02:55.700> yeah<00:02:55.970> and<00:02:56.510> then

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
what triggers ish I think yeah and then

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.229 
what triggers ish I think yeah and then
modifying<00:02:57.260> those<00:02:58.070> triggers<00:02:58.519> yeah<00:02:58.880> tailored

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
modifying those triggers yeah tailored

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:01.479 
modifying those triggers yeah tailored
it<00:02:59.330> can<00:02:59.450> be<00:02:59.570> really<00:02:59.750> affect<00:03:00.230> okay<00:03:00.560> and<00:03:00.769> then

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
legs apart or set causing any sort of

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:19.960 
legs apart or set causing any sort of
separation<00:03:18.680> at<00:03:18.769> the<00:03:18.860> pelvis<00:03:19.310> we<00:03:19.459> activate

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
separation at the pelvis we activate

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.340 
separation at the pelvis we activate
these<00:03:20.120> symptoms<00:03:20.450> so<00:03:20.660> it's<00:03:20.780> just<00:03:20.870> a<00:03:20.989> matter<00:03:21.019> of

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
these symptoms so it's just a matter of

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:22.870 
these symptoms so it's just a matter of
knowing<00:03:21.650> what<00:03:21.860> they<00:03:22.040> are<00:03:22.070> and<00:03:22.340> voyage<00:03:22.640> in<00:03:22.760> them

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
knowing what they are and voyage in them

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.490 
knowing what they are and voyage in them
ok<00:03:23.209> so<00:03:23.420> the<00:03:23.510> classics<00:03:23.900> are<00:03:23.989> getting<00:03:24.260> in<00:03:24.350> and

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
ok so the classics are getting in and

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.350 
ok so the classics are getting in and
there's<00:03:24.620> the<00:03:24.799> connor/getty<00:03:25.400> an<00:03:25.910> image<00:03:26.180> the

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
there's the connor/getty an image the

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.660 
there's the connor/getty an image the
page<00:03:26.540> or<00:03:26.840> maybe<00:03:27.019> on<00:03:27.170> a<00:03:27.200> sofa<00:03:27.650> so<00:03:28.400> in<00:03:28.549> those

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
page or maybe on a sofa so in those

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.250 
page or maybe on a sofa so in those
cases<00:03:28.730> really<00:03:29.330> important<00:03:29.660> you<00:03:29.690> try<00:03:29.840> to<00:03:29.930> clamp

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
cases really important you try to clamp

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.340 
cases really important you try to clamp
your<00:03:30.410> legs<00:03:30.739> and<00:03:31.010> then<00:03:31.190> losing<00:03:31.640> one<00:03:32.390> oh<00:03:32.690> yeah

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
your legs and then losing one oh yeah

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.860 
your legs and then losing one oh yeah
the<00:03:33.519> separation<00:03:34.519> because<00:03:34.790> okay<00:03:35.030> causes<00:03:35.600> a<00:03:35.690> lot

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
the separation because okay causes a lot

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.170
