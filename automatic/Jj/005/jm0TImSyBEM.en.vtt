 shorter cool they asked me to put 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:13.070
 music on the seven without thinking twice miraculously 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:16.500

 rack and one of the door speakers itself 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.430
 but how much is the cheap option 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:44.579
 so if there is no money you can insert 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:47.520

 you have enough to listen normally 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.990
 music that's how many meters 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.070

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:02.110
 more than enough for the car 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:06.040
 one very important topic I myself which 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.410
 I searched for a long time very hard 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.790

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.660
 rear left 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:21.180
 In short, this pinout is if 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:25.050
 radio put here like that 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:29.170
 closer to the front left 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:32.380
 then white wire and gray front right 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:35.610
 and from myself that is back left this 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:38.880
 green and purple 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:42.310
 right right column 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.380
 even as possible if you have them already 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.650
 installed as can be distinguished very de 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.120
 where is right where is plus where is minus 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:53.260

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:56.970
 along with black here is purple with black 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:59.860
 yes means minus on the dynamics can this 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.220
 battery horn then log plus 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.359

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:09.840
 poles to stand so that it does not 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:12.100
 spoiled if the diffuser goes up 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.260
 it means we connected correctly to start 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.570
 plus or minus is right with us and everything 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.489

 plus and minus, that is, either 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:33.160
 they go square with round that is 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:35.170
 square plus round minus either they 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.079
 if both are round then different in color 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.340
 then itâ€™s golden plus 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:40.600
 silver minus this too if you want 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.709
