think<00:02:04.409> it'd<00:02:04.500> be<00:02:04.530> a<00:02:04.649> great<00:02:04.950> layering<00:02:05.189> piece

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
think it'd be a great layering piece

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.249 
think it'd be a great layering piece
because<00:02:06.030> it<00:02:06.479> would<00:02:06.600> add<00:02:06.780> some<00:02:07.110> of<00:02:07.229> that

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
because it would add some of that

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.740 
because it would add some of that
freshness<00:02:07.680> to<00:02:08.160> a<00:02:08.190> scent<00:02:08.520> but<00:02:09.270> I<00:02:09.300> don't<00:02:09.599> think

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
freshness to a scent but I don't think

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.440 
freshness to a scent but I don't think
I'd<00:02:09.840> wear<00:02:09.959> it<00:02:10.110> by<00:02:10.200> itself<00:02:10.229> just<00:02:11.009> because

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
I'd wear it by itself just because

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.420 
I'd wear it by itself just because
so<00:02:11.690> common<00:02:14.050> the<00:02:15.050> bottle<00:02:15.380> is<00:02:15.530> really<00:02:15.860> pretty

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
so common the bottle is really pretty

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.670 
so common the bottle is really pretty
it's<00:02:16.760> like<00:02:17.030> you<00:02:17.420> know<00:02:17.540> it's<00:02:18.020> like<00:02:18.110> across<00:02:18.620> the

it's like you know it's like across the

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.190 
it's like you know it's like across the
glass<00:02:19.130> and<00:02:19.520> it<00:02:19.580> the<00:02:19.819> cat<00:02:20.030> comes<00:02:20.300> off<00:02:20.480> I<00:02:20.750> got

this for $35 off eBay at 3.3 outs

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.880 
this for $35 off eBay at 3.3 outs
because<00:02:25.640> it<00:02:26.030> is<00:02:26.150> a<00:02:26.180> tester<00:02:26.750> as<00:02:27.500> you<00:02:27.590> can<00:02:27.709> see

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
because it is a tester as you can see

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.670 
because it is a tester as you can see
that<00:02:28.130> the<00:02:28.489> notes<00:02:29.060> back<00:02:29.300> here<00:02:29.540> but<00:02:29.750> you<00:02:30.350> can<00:02:30.560> get

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
it at Sephora for I think $80

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.640 
it at Sephora for I think $80
80<00:02:33.380> some<00:02:33.739> dollars<00:02:34.100> is<00:02:34.280> the<00:02:34.310> 3.3<00:02:35.300> ounce<00:02:35.650> it

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
80 some dollars is the 3.3 ounce it

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.070 
80 some dollars is the 3.3 ounce it
definitely<00:02:37.010> check<00:02:37.130> on<00:02:37.280> eBay<00:02:37.640> so<00:02:38.480> I<00:02:38.510> think<00:02:38.660> this

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
definitely check on eBay so I think this

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.320 
definitely check on eBay so I think this
