zombies um isn't command blocks i found

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.050 
zombies um isn't command blocks i found
out<00:00:24.510> a<00:00:24.570> lot<00:00:24.750> of<00:00:24.840> ways<00:00:24.990> you<00:00:25.019> can<00:00:25.820> do<00:00:26.820> some<00:00:27.029> cool

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
out a lot of ways you can do some cool

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.570 
out a lot of ways you can do some cool
things<00:00:27.269> with<00:00:27.750> command<00:00:28.140> blocks<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.710> make<00:00:29.310> cool

maps<00:00:29.789> so<00:00:30.090> i<00:00:30.330> thought<00:00:30.599> i<00:00:30.810> would<00:00:30.840> show<00:00:31.199> this<00:00:31.349> to

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
maps so i thought i would show this to

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.670 
maps so i thought i would show this to
everyone<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.759> map<00:00:32.969> will<00:00:33.180> be<00:00:33.239> released<00:00:33.719> as

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
everyone the map will be released as

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.470 
everyone the map will be released as
soon<00:00:34.890> as<00:00:35.040> i<00:00:35.130> can<00:00:35.190> do<00:00:35.430> it<00:00:35.550> except<00:00:35.910> i'm<00:00:36.090> seven

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
soon as i can do it except i'm seven

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.780

trouble<00:00:36.780> with<00:00:36.870> some<00:00:37.140> of<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.469> mechanics<00:00:38.190> and

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
trouble with some of the mechanics and

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.850 
trouble with some of the mechanics and
i'd<00:00:39.270> need<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.809> build<00:00:40.110> like<00:00:40.320> torture<00:00:40.710> in<00:00:40.829> the

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
i'd need to build like torture in the

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.479 
i'd need to build like torture in the
rooms<00:00:41.420> so<00:00:42.829> what<00:00:43.829> i<00:00:43.860> thought<00:00:44.100> i'll<00:00:44.219> show<00:00:44.430> you

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
rooms so what i thought i'll show you

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.639 
rooms so what i thought i'll show you
today<00:00:44.670> is<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.450> /<00:00:45.660> commissions<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.379> how<00:00:46.530> they

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
today is the / commissions and how they

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.790 
today is the / commissions and how they
work<00:00:47.059> so<00:00:48.059> basically<00:00:48.420> just<00:00:49.200> like<00:00:49.500> your<00:00:49.649> new

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
work so basically just like your new

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.549 
work so basically just like your new
zombies<00:00:50.190> if<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:51.329> try<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.539> buy<00:00:51.840> perk<00:00:52.230> when<00:00:52.469> the

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
zombies if you try to buy perk when the

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.069 
zombies if you try to buy perk when the
power<00:00:52.739> on<00:00:53.129> it<00:00:53.640> says<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.510> need<00:00:54.660> in<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.899> pound

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
power on it says you need in the pound

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.790 
power on it says you need in the pound
first<00:00:55.379> which<00:00:55.680> was<00:00:55.980> done<00:00:56.219> with<00:00:56.430> fam<00:00:56.789> box<00:00:57.030> um<00:00:57.800> as

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
first which was done with fam box um as

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.650 
first which was done with fam box um as
you<00:00:58.859> can<00:00:59.129> see<00:00:59.309> these<00:00:59.460> images<00:00:59.640> I<00:01:00.149> quick<00:01:00.390> revive

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
you can see these images I quick revive

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.930 
you can see these images I quick revive
so<00:01:00.899> that<00:01:01.199> we<00:01:01.289> used<00:01:01.530> with<00:01:01.680> image<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.250> map<00:01:02.399> so<00:01:02.730> I'm

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
so that we used with image to map so I'm

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.500 
so that we used with image to map so I'm
not<00:01:03.120> actually<00:01:03.300> using<00:01:03.510> any<00:01:03.809> tech<00:01:04.080> specs<00:01:04.470> um<00:01:05.510> I'm

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
not actually using any tech specs um I'm

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.120 
not actually using any tech specs um I'm
not<00:01:06.750> actually<00:01:06.900> using<00:01:07.080> any<00:01:07.290> tech<00:01:07.500> specs<00:01:07.799> we<00:01:07.979> can

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
not actually using any tech specs we can

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.460 
not actually using any tech specs we can
see<00:01:08.369> this<00:01:08.939> picture<00:01:09.270> for<00:01:09.689> them<00:01:09.840> these<00:01:10.229> are<00:01:10.439> just

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
see this picture for them these are just

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.560 
see this picture for them these are just
maps<00:01:10.860> inside<00:01:13.340> their<00:01:14.340> maps<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:14.970> fibers<00:01:15.330> inside

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
maps inside their maps and fibers inside

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.660 
maps inside their maps and fibers inside
picture<00:01:16.140> frames<00:01:16.380> except<00:01:16.890> their<00:01:17.070> custom<00:01:17.460> maps

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
picture frames except their custom maps

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.310 
picture frames except their custom maps
so<00:01:18.540> yeah<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.710> can't<00:01:19.950> buy<00:01:20.159> anything<00:01:20.369> yet<00:01:20.700> um

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
now I'll show you what happens when we

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.280 
now I'll show you what happens when we
turn<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.700> power<00:01:23.850> on<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:24.750> can<00:01:24.869> also<00:01:25.020> see

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
turn the power on and you can also see

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.990 
turn the power on and you can also see
this<00:01:25.530> door<00:01:25.770> is<00:01:25.920> closed<00:01:26.250> once<00:01:26.549> that<00:01:26.759> when<00:01:26.909> the

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
this door is closed once that when the

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.719 
this door is closed once that when the
powers<00:01:27.330> of<00:01:27.450> all<00:01:27.740> so<00:01:28.740> I<00:01:29.009> have<00:01:29.220> not<00:01:29.430> built<00:01:29.549> all

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
powers of all so I have not built all

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.660 
powers of all so I have not built all
the<00:01:29.880> rooms<00:01:30.090> except<00:01:30.750> i'll<00:01:31.439> just<00:01:31.710> run<00:01:32.520> around

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
the rooms except i'll just run around

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.830 
the rooms except i'll just run around
this<00:01:32.909> way<00:01:33.409> three<00:01:34.409> ah<00:01:34.860> this<00:01:35.549> map<00:01:36.240> is<00:01:36.299> missing

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
this way three ah this map is missing

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.050 
this way three ah this map is missing
the<00:01:36.990> wall<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.530> that's<00:01:38.159> because<00:01:38.250> i<00:01:38.400> am<00:01:38.579> headed

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
the wall and that's because i am headed

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.600 
the wall and that's because i am headed
this<00:01:39.360> map<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.439> high<00:01:40.619> level<00:01:40.829> side<00:01:41.250> that<00:01:41.430> put

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
this map to a high level side that put

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.510 
this map to a high level side that put
all<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.790> red<00:01:41.939> stone<00:01:42.150> under<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:43.220> now<00:01:44.220> this

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
all the red stone under it and now this

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.060 
all the red stone under it and now this
map<00:01:44.909> creator<00:01:45.479> is<00:01:45.869> a<00:01:45.930> really<00:01:46.170> good<00:01:46.290> guy<00:01:46.530> he<00:01:46.829> made

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
map creator is a really good guy he made

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.609 
map creator is a really good guy he made
these<00:01:47.640> two<00:01:47.939> rooms<00:01:48.149> except<00:01:49.140> there's<00:01:49.409> not

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
these two rooms except there's not

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.950 
these two rooms except there's not
really<00:01:49.799> much<00:01:50.009> redstone<00:01:50.549> so<00:01:51.390> i<00:01:51.420> decided<00:01:51.840> to
