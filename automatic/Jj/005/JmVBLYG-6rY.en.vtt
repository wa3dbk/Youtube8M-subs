00:00:08.579 --> 00:00:13.070
 attention now begins a screen and biology class of high school 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.900
 You will watch as far as number 47 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.439
 good studies 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:21.439
 we do not know anything 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.659
 Ana 

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:29.640
 the day laborer 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.489
 do you think that they send letters in practice is not so or more important 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:36.199
 than frightened the owners of the drug 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:40.410
 what is our focus now are the most complaints like to stay 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.410
 you hit in full with claw 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.620
 agents or any kind of exercise that we had 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.820
 when he returned to the country and had no effect 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.100
 they still play with the cge 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.100
 to worsen does not cut nearly a third in the slower 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.690
 What happens to these insects? 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.300
 sarkozy become accustomed to these citizens 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.850
 or is there another explanation for this phenomenon 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.920
 that's what we'll see today's footprint 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.240
 today's material you will learn that living beings of the same species may have 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.899
 different individual characteristics will see that these characteristics are 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:20.899
 between parental measures for their offspring 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.590
 he still how these characteristics influence the process of selection 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:27.930
 Natural 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.140
 with insecticides are substances that have been developed to kill insects 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.710
 they kill animal quickly so I get it right so that any 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.850
 resistance type 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.590
 what happens is that some of these insects are not affected by the poison 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.320
 Why will this happen? 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.320
 Let's think a little 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.940
 Let's think a little 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.260
 insects that do not die are resistant to insecticides 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:58.710
 this resistance 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.870
 is a feature that others do not have 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:06.030
 year are the so-called characteristics they are entitled to receive 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.310
 to better understand what individual characteristics we are going to 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.560
 to remember what is kind 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.409
 thing that you already learned here in the course 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:20.419
 for example us humans are the ones of the inspection the sagÃ¼is there are many 

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:23.659
 characteristics in common in which all the human beings of the planet 

00:02:24.499 --> 00:02:30.059
 the development of the brain the enzymes produced along the digestive tract the 

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:34.329
 hormones responsible for sexual characteristics 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:36.649
 get you to store energy 

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:40.799
 finally we are equal in many characteristics but we also have 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:45.589
 many differences as the physiognomic traits the color of the eyes the color of the 

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:48.589
 skin type of hair and fingerprints 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:53.499
 she made the Brazilian baby is a people - it made alert 

00:02:53.499 --> 00:02:56.129
 There you are alone. 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:59.129
 We kept talking 

00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:02.079
 no line-up 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:03.519
 but the 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.189
 in the world 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:07.999
 we humans are suzano resort 

00:03:07.999 --> 00:03:09.779
 - concert 

00:03:09.779 --> 00:03:12.899
 each in a different way but are also all friends press 

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:16.709
 although if we happen to have many things in common 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.709
 and mid-field analysts 

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:23.669
 I think they are they are so alike they are not 

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:28.419
 the Portuguese mid-field ju of the same species is not the question 

00:03:29.179 --> 00:03:31.179
 And you know why the mother 

00:03:31.179 --> 00:03:32.189
 I do not 

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:36.730
 the two have so many kids out there and under the law and I think this 

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:38.909
 It's such a special subject. 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:43.400
 how do we know if two living beings belong to the same species if they exist 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.639
 so many individual differences 

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:46.859
 there is only one way 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:50.529
 checking the cross between them resulted in a different design 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:53.839
 the document is a water for example 

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:56.389
 they even concepts is still a puppy 

00:03:56.389 --> 00:03:59.060
 but the offspring that is born is a mule 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.129
 which is not fertile 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:03.059
 they are not of the same species 

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:06.309
 because when they mate they do not produce fertile offspring 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.019
 of these butterflies with different designs on the wings 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:12.569
 are another example 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:15.149
 as they do not become fertile at the same time of year 

00:04:15.149 --> 00:04:20.339
 can not mate so it is not the same species of data that the 

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:23.460
 dogs you can cross the most different breeds 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.819
 the fertile puppies performance 

00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:31.080
 however different they may seem, they are all of the same species 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.310
 there are different characteristics determined by the genetic material of 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:37.860
 an individual or 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.860
 no living being even of the same species is exactly like the other 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.360
 we return to our example of mosquitoes some are resistant some decide 

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:50.499
 and this is determined genetically 

00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:51.370
 therefore 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:52.580
 they are born with this characteristic
