00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:13.510
 Hello everyone in this video I want to show 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:15.299
 such a thing as for example the sole 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.439
 consists of cells 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.420
 cell's contemporaries begin to break 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:22.539
 if especially the weight of a person is pretty 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.849
 so massive that's how this problem 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:29.619
 decide here look i did her but it 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:30.849
 everything will be clear to you here you see I take 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.280
 micropore pieces 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:35.800
 literally grabs the scraps making of them 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.440
 squares rectangles and glue makoi 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.090
 they neatly insert certain 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.559
 so that they do not speak clearly that all 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.050
 it was ok see this all 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:45.910
 you can see that we protect the heel part where 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.519
 just take the height of the sole 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:51.910
 you are all inside there with cells through 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:54.730
 there are literally two days there are three 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:57.280
 very well set and becomes 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:00.489
 everything is very tight and now we will stay 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:05.110
 Only do stenochku here it is already too 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:07.150
 ready making granite do they give two layers 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:11.680
 necessarily two layers because then and 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:12.009
 his first and stiffness are good and there 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.350
 we have 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:15.820
 the toe part is also a cell but they 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.369
 we didnâ€™t burst into weight 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:21.189
 Smaller is the full length 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:23.860
 if you want you can make 3 more semi 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:27.130
 the insole but that's enough and cover the skin 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.570
 so that they donâ€™t wear too closely 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.000
 surely insert the edge see 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:34.360
 so she lays down beautifully neat 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:39.119
 now we insert it is possible to smear that crookedly 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:41.710
 inside and the walls will fall yes well and 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.500
 stick it now he'll just show who 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.520
 already and glue it all now for example man 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.770
 with good weight 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.990
 sole such a problem already bring not 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.729
 will these cells be kept well 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.729
 though there are such cases of the same show 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:57.280
 nicknamed such cells that already meaning 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:59.979
 there are just some big tab 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.729
 do well too solves too 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.930
 whole here 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:06.000
 so I solved this problem I hope you 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.780
 it will come in handy 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.860
 subscribe to my channel put 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.860
 likes happy
