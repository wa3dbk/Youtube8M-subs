00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.139
 Hello, again, unpacking is enough 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:13.969
 a small parcel here I am the contents 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:13.969
 the city of Vologda has come 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:26.279
 Many thought think already learned that this 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:31.250
 such is the northern artel city of Vologda 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:35.870
 and here we have glued paper 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.870
 without any scotch on liquid nails 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:48.440
 plate is here for this grinder 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.440
 we will open 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:06.320
 this 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:09.860
 Our package is such a stove 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:13.710
 cast iron for grinder 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:16.080
 quite ideally you can say 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:23.160
 exactly one side polished it 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:25.380
 and such a little bit too smooth but not so 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.460
 like polished on the other hand here 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.810
 there are two small chips 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.990
 which absolutely will not affect 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:40.729
 on its functionality 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:46.009
 so the size is 50 millimeters 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:46.009
 by 165 millimeters 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:54.899
 8 millimeters thickness of this plate 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.000
 how would it be used but 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.679
 instead 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.250
 porcelain stoneware slabs which comes with 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:01.740
 grinder 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.660
 this is her main purpose 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:08.759
 what to see but if you apply 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:11.660
 perpendicular to the ruler then the surface 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.660
 perfectly smooth 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:23.940
 such a cast iron plate is worth it 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:25.459
 pleasure 600 rubles link I will give where 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.739
 I took 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:34.500
 so who needs to grind it in 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:37.310
 principle quite a useful thing now 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.310

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:44.750
