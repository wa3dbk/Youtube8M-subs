00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:43.800
 well I think 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.800
 if he is walking 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:49.130
 It was too big 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:51.680
 this list in this sauce I want 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.180
 remember that you can see all of our 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.120

 the staff can follow us 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:04.160
 that steals peanuts monkeys in the law of 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:07.400
 lazy to him lazy scripted under 14 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:11.450
 because this one who went down to 14th annual rob 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:13.400
 They spend years and I want to also say 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.020
 that there may be behind those recipes to 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.730
 through the youtube page there 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.350
 we are and also through the page 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.420
 of cadenatres that I love and I was 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:23.310
 in the we are seeing so much oil 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.950
 very little, not much 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.080
 and nothing but the delicious sauce extración 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.690
 I left her with all the little seeds to me 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.349
 I'm interested and what's straining is very 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.349
 important 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:40.840
 I do not want anything else 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.410
 little bit thick I do not want it so watery 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:46.530
 very good ok 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.330
 the chili has some ingredient that 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.750
 helps thicken us which is a 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:54.150
 delight also the guajillo chile is 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.650
 center of the republic the most but 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.420
 yes language or housing and they come from 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.100
 state of zacatecas de aguascalientes 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.360
 are from very out there we are going to add 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.160
 our flesh that I now have 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.290
 previously already cooked in your corner and 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.120
 Now he is very rich in the feet no brother 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.890
 our meat is already cooked for 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.060
 leave it carl the people who are starting 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.650
 to tune in what I'm doing 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.180
 backbone of sears in guajillo sauce 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.900
 that is spectacular 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.900
 I go for my spoon 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.019
 to mix everything perfectly 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:24.770
 and I 'm going to lend nothing more that breaks 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.770
 the boiling point 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.800
 well nothing more than rich this meat I 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.560
 agreement I for example there is one that is 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.510
 as more liquid and if my grandmother 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.270
 it made of thorns that was a delight was 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:39.100
 as well as the delicious one because from 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.050
 a very rich meat that melts that 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.150
 lag apart the tudelano ringo me 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.070
 value so much with good salt I love 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.870
 we have never made marrows here true 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.670
 you do not have to do you have to do it right 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.620
 I'm going to tell you that the taquitos of 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:52.570
 marrow is very funny but in the 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:56.110
 restaurants two marrow taquitos 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:59.290
 they cost up to 50 pesos each 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:01.480
 this 22 but good we go to the verdolagas 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:03.580
 the verdolagas even in water are 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.230
 delicious and it is a that the item already nothing 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.930
 more the only thing we did in the kitchen 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:10.780
 was to remove the thick stems then 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:14.130
 It is very important and we are going to add it 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:16.990
 my sister shrink a lot very much 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:18.870
 time nerve pretty since this is 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.889
 seasoned and alexis to our sauce 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.900
 remember that it is not mature poses 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:24.280
 tactic the seasoning and I 'm going for some 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.650
 vegetables I like that the 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.060
 verdolagas look also very fresh you 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:30.669
 I'm going to put a few verdolagas 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:32.110
 first so that they go cooking and 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:33.639
 let's have the vegetables with the 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.980
 flavor along with this thorn are our 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:38.200
 sauce but missing about five minutes 

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:39.760
 before serving I'm going to put so much 

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:42.669
 ink is true so that when 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:44.530
 previous diner see the verdolagas a 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:45.940
 half-baked to become rich in rich 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:48.220
 not that it looks good you can see that the 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.360
 we have there because they are lost to us and 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:52.390
 nothing more 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:54.610
 this coffee you hear ugly and I think it's 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:56.380
 which is a very good option to have them 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.690
 also fresh I'm going to leave half of 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:00.360
 my verdolagas lists and now I am going to 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:03.000
