00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.700
 this is a video sponsored by nothing 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.740
 well this was nothing hello friends addicted 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.389
 to the golfers I am kai black cat 94 and 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.369
 I bring you my first video of the 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.260
 dark mysteries that are in 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:19.890
 the video games a lot of the console 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.920
 nintendo 64 good the first of these is 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.990
 mario 64 if they have played it they will notice that in 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.060
 the castle at the bottom there is a 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.100
 dungeon where there should be dungeons 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.289
 the strangest thing is that there are only three 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.030
 very difficult levels to achieve this 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.780
 means that the prisoners are 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.850
 they threw the fire into the desert and the moat 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.550
 this is subliminal this is simply 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.409
 one theory and the second if you're not well 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.239
 in the dungeon is the level of 

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:47.069
 fire and on top of the 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.549
 castle is the level of sky that 

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:52.499
 represents this heaven and hell and 

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:54.960
 in each level of these attributes it in the 

00:00:52.499 --> 00:00:57.420
 of fire there are enemies with horns and 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.159
 the eyes watching you everywhere and in 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.409
 the sky is rare and told to 

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:03.839
 enemies that there is besides there is a castle 

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:05.549
 and rainbow although the strangest thing is that 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:07.890
 the real boxer is in the part 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.230
 end of the castle what does this mean 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.150
 that he is above heaven and hell 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:15.010
 and the second game is that of zelda 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.930
 ocarina of time if you notice in this 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.730
 game in the part that you have to find 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.680
 the lens of truth you have to go to 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.930
 place that can be the darkest of 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.090
 the saga if I speak of the tenebrous well 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.250
 is that to enter there you have to be 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.200
 simply a child with weaker items 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.410
 it is a weaker sword and a shield of 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.480
 crap another mystery in this game is 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.970
 the writing and liang this writing 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.500
 It has many strange messages since 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.510
 I found an image with some 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.160
 meaning and I would not be surprised to know 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.350
 that the true origin of writing 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.750
 and jan comes from an ancient language and 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.760
 pagan basically writing and liam 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.320
 it is encoded with ancient symbols 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.330
 keep in mind that many of the 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.400
 written communication methods are 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.980
 based on dead languages 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.380
 ancient hidden languages symbols 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:01.570
 pagans et cetera etcetera good here them 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.940
 I leave the image in the game of zelda 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.730
 majora's mask once we reach the top 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.770
 from the tower of rocks or stone tower we see 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.630
 one face and on your left one hand 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.850
 pointing to the sky and with your finger 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.680
 on fire showing what could be the 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.080
 goal of the builders of this 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.210
 building the sky and a sign of rage 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.830
 towards 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.600
 represented by fire this is already 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.180
 I could see from the first versions 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.370
 of the game in this game is the only one of 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.350
 the saga you can kill a person if 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.720
 remember when you go to the northern part of 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.670
 the city clock at midnight the first 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.920
 day a thief appears who assaults 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.540
 an old woman you hit an arrow or with 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.490
 the bomb mask he explodes and does not 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.520
 will appear the second day to sell what 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:44.920
 stolen from the curio shop the 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.290
 next is in luigi's mansion if in 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.090
 this game of this fag says that if 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.100
 you are in a certain room of the 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.500
 mansion at a specific point when 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.690
 lightning strike you will see the shadow of 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.180
 weegee hanged according to what I read the 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.220
 game would be more spooky good here 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.950
