this<00:00:35.309> year<00:00:35.370> was<00:00:35.700> actually<00:00:36.140> at<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.260> front<00:00:37.440> of

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
this year was actually at the front of

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.860 
this year was actually at the front of
the<00:00:37.590> bike<00:00:37.739> we<00:00:38.399> relaxed<00:00:38.879> head<00:00:39.090> angles<00:00:39.510> on<00:00:39.719> the

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
the bike we relaxed head angles on the

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.260 
the bike we relaxed head angles on the
bikes<00:00:40.050> from<00:00:40.469> 70<00:00:40.860> degrees<00:00:41.190> down<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.730> 69<00:00:42.239> degrees

bikes from 70 degrees down to 69 degrees
feeling<00:00:43.140> a<00:00:43.200> bit<00:00:43.379> more<00:00:43.410> sure-footed<00:00:44.250> kind<00:00:44.789> of

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
feeling a bit more sure-footed kind of

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.690 
feeling a bit more sure-footed kind of
descending<00:00:46.140> but<00:00:46.800> still<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.129> bit<00:00:47.250> more<00:00:47.399> stable

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
even on the flat stuff we actually

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.369 
even on the flat stuff we actually
removed<00:00:50.460> like<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.570> downtube<00:00:51.989> gusset<00:00:52.350> that

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
removed like the downtube gusset that

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.810 
removed like the downtube gusset that
we've<00:00:52.530> always<00:00:52.680> had<00:00:52.890> in<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.039> past<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.699> that

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
compulsion series as we've actually

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.710 
compulsion series as we've actually
improved<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:26.400> virtue<00:01:26.759> we've<00:01:27.150> done<00:01:27.299> a<00:01:27.330> lot<00:01:27.600> of

similar<00:01:28.080> things<00:01:28.110> on<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.710> compulsion<00:01:29.159> we've

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
similar things on the compulsion we've

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.359 
similar things on the compulsion we've
adjusted<00:01:30.450> butting<00:01:31.259> profiles<00:01:31.770> from<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.100> tubes

adjusted butting profiles from the tubes

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.600 
adjusted butting profiles from the tubes
we<00:01:32.790> also<00:01:32.939> pulled<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:34.259> degree<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.189> a<00:01:35.250> half<00:01:35.280> out

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
we also pulled a degree and a half out

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.420 
we also pulled a degree and a half out
of<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.820> head<00:01:35.939> angle<00:01:36.299> as<00:01:36.799> we<00:01:37.799> move<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.189> virtue

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
of the head angle as we move the virtue

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.929 
of the head angle as we move the virtue
back<00:01:38.850> into<00:01:39.180> more<00:01:39.329> of<00:01:40.520> aggressive<00:01:41.520> kind<00:01:41.820> of

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
back into more of aggressive kind of

race to marathon too fast trail bike we

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.149 
race to marathon too fast trail bike we
found<00:01:45.869> that<00:01:45.990> we<00:01:46.049> needed<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.409> lighten<00:01:46.680> up<00:01:46.920> the

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
found that we needed to lighten up the

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.359 
found that we needed to lighten up the
compulsions<00:01:47.909> because<00:01:48.740> there's<00:01:49.740> no<00:01:49.920> reason

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369

really anyone out there can touch that
yeah<00:02:49.630> last<00:02:49.870> year<00:02:49.990> we<00:02:50.230> introduced<00:02:50.680> the<00:02:50.920> carbon

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
yeah last year we introduced the carbon

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.550 
yeah last year we introduced the carbon
hard<00:02:52.870> tails<00:02:53.170> basically<00:02:54.040> in<00:02:54.130> 26<00:02:54.670> and<00:02:54.850> 29<00:02:55.120> inch

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
hard tails basically in 26 and 29 inch

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.980 
hard tails basically in 26 and 29 inch
versions<00:02:56.790> last<00:02:57.790> year<00:02:57.940> we<00:02:58.090> did<00:02:58.210> two<00:02:58.420> models<00:02:58.810> of

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:58.990 
versions last year we did two models of

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.620 
versions last year we did two models of
the<00:02:59.200> twenty<00:02:59.830> six<00:03:00.100> or<00:03:00.220> six<00:03:00.610> series<00:03:01.030> as<00:03:01.270> we<00:03:01.390> call

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
the twenty six or six series as we call

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.350 
the twenty six or six series as we call
them<00:03:02.070> this<00:03:03.070> year<00:03:03.100> we<00:03:03.400> actually<00:03:03.490> expanded<00:03:04.210> that

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
them this year we actually expanded that

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.920 
them this year we actually expanded that
to<00:03:04.630> include<00:03:04.810> an<00:03:05.260> XT<00:03:05.590> our<00:03:05.740> equip<00:03:06.040> bike<00:03:06.930> the

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
to include an XT our equip bike the

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.780 
to include an XT our equip bike the
top-end<00:03:08.290> bike<00:03:08.530> basically<00:03:08.740> features<00:03:09.550> the

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
top-end bike basically features the

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.520 
top-end bike basically features the
lightest<00:03:10.390> frame<00:03:10.630> that<00:03:10.840> we<00:03:10.960> do<00:03:11.110> which<00:03:11.290> is<00:03:11.320> a

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
lightest frame that we do which is a

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.150 
lightest frame that we do which is a
thousand<00:03:11.950> fifty<00:03:12.250> grams<00:03:13.710> last<00:03:14.710> year<00:03:14.890> is<00:03:15.010> only

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
thousand fifty grams last year is only

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.980 
thousand fifty grams last year is only
available<00:03:15.310> to<00:03:15.670> frame<00:03:15.970> set<00:03:16.210> this<00:03:16.390> year<00:03:16.690> with

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:16.990 
available to frame set this year with

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.340 
available to frame set this year with
the<00:03:17.080> XT<00:03:17.440> our<00:03:17.610> kit<00:03:18.610> and<00:03:18.880> also<00:03:19.000> CID<00:03:19.750> World<00:03:19.960> Cup<00:03:20.200> on

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
the XT our kit and also CID World Cup on

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:21.540 
the XT our kit and also CID World Cup on
it<00:03:20.470> we're<00:03:20.800> actually<00:03:20.890> able<00:03:21.070> to<00:03:21.190> get<00:03:21.340> a<00:03:21.370> bike

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550 
it we're actually able to get a bike

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.050 
it we're actually able to get a bike
down<00:03:21.790> to<00:03:21.970> 19<00:03:22.450> pounds<00:03:23.370> geometry<00:03:24.370> is<00:03:24.460> identical

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
down to 19 pounds geometry is identical

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.940 
down to 19 pounds geometry is identical
to<00:03:25.090> what<00:03:25.540> we<00:03:25.750> had<00:03:25.870> last<00:03:26.050> year<00:03:26.380> it's<00:03:26.500> basically

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
to what we had last year it's basically

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.070 
to what we had last year it's basically
our<00:03:27.070> proven<00:03:27.490> our<00:03:27.640> exceed<00:03:28.060> geometry<00:03:28.630> so<00:03:28.930> it's

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
our proven our exceed geometry so it's

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.550 
our proven our exceed geometry so it's
designed<00:03:29.470> for<00:03:30.090> super<00:03:31.090> fast<00:03:31.120> trail<00:03:31.600> riding<00:03:31.900> and

and<00:03:45.070> so<00:03:46.030> far<00:03:46.270> I<00:03:46.300> mean<00:03:46.420> feedback<00:03:46.960> on<00:03:47.110> this<00:03:47.260> has

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
and so far I mean feedback on this has

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.470 
and so far I mean feedback on this has
been<00:03:47.590> pretty<00:03:48.010> amazing<00:03:48.130> again<00:03:48.970> introduced

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
been pretty amazing again introduced

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.170 
been pretty amazing again introduced
last<00:03:50.080> year<00:03:50.290> at<00:03:50.650> Interbike<00:03:51.160> was<00:03:51.550> our<00:03:51.790> nine

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
last year at Interbike was our nine

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.810 
last year at Interbike was our nine
carbon<00:03:52.720> series<00:03:53.140> using<00:03:53.860> a<00:03:53.920> lot<00:03:54.070> of<00:03:54.250> technology

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:54.820 
carbon series using a lot of technology

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.020 
carbon series using a lot of technology
that<00:03:54.850> we<00:03:55.150> developed<00:03:55.990> in<00:03:56.260> our<00:03:56.470> road<00:03:56.710> bikes<00:03:57.030> so

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
that we developed in our road bikes so

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.870 
that we developed in our road bikes so
we<00:03:58.060> also<00:03:58.270> used<00:03:58.660> in<00:03:58.930> our<00:03:59.080> six<00:03:59.350> series<00:03:59.680> bikes<00:03:59.950> we

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
we also used in our six series bikes we

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.370 
we also used in our six series bikes we
basically<00:04:01.150> wanted<00:04:01.510> to<00:04:01.540> build<00:04:01.690> a<00:04:01.840> bike<00:04:02.020> that

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
basically wanted to build a bike that

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.320 
basically wanted to build a bike that
even<00:04:03.160> though<00:04:03.280> it's<00:04:03.430> got<00:04:03.550> a<00:04:03.580> 29<00:04:04.000> inch<00:04:04.210> wheel

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
even though it's got a 29 inch wheel

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.410 
even though it's got a 29 inch wheel
still<00:04:04.960> rode<00:04:05.460> almost<00:04:06.460> exactly<00:04:06.820> the<00:04:06.940> same<00:04:07.000> as<00:04:07.210> a

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
still rode almost exactly the same as a

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:08.800 
still rode almost exactly the same as a
26<00:04:07.930> inch<00:04:08.200> can't

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
26 inch can't

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.620 
26 inch can't
basically<00:04:09.620> low<00:04:10.250> bottom<00:04:10.490> bracket<00:04:10.640> steep

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
basically low bottom bracket steep

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.320 
basically low bottom bracket steep
angles<00:04:12.140> very<00:04:12.590> fast<00:04:12.920> handling<00:04:13.459> for<00:04:13.670> 29er

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:14.330 
angles very fast handling for 29er

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.090 
angles very fast handling for 29er
this<00:04:14.720> is<00:04:14.840> basically<00:04:15.170> designed<00:04:15.440> as<00:04:15.830> a<00:04:15.860> race

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
this is basically designed as a race

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.819 
this is basically designed as a race
bike<00:04:16.400> not<00:04:16.700> as<00:04:16.880> just<00:04:17.090> a<00:04:17.239> trail<00:04:17.870> bike<00:04:18.079> however

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:18.829 
bike not as just a trail bike however

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:20.259 
bike not as just a trail bike however
set<00:04:19.370> the<00:04:19.489> bike<00:04:19.669> up<00:04:19.850> with<00:04:20.000> a<00:04:20.030> hundred

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
set the bike up with a hundred

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.270 
set the bike up with a hundred
millimeter<00:04:20.750> fork<00:04:21.019> and<00:04:21.320> you<00:04:21.650> have<00:04:21.889> a<00:04:21.919> trail

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
millimeter fork and you have a trail

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.330 
millimeter fork and you have a trail
bike<00:04:22.460> in<00:04:23.120> addition<00:04:23.510> to<00:04:23.630> the<00:04:23.960> nine<00:04:24.380> carbons<00:04:24.830> we

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
bike in addition to the nine carbons we

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.100 
bike in addition to the nine carbons we
still<00:04:25.730> carry<00:04:25.940> through<00:04:26.210> on<00:04:26.240> the<00:04:26.450> nine<00:04:26.720> alloy

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
still carry through on the nine alloy

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.440 
still carry through on the nine alloy
models<00:04:27.590> this<00:04:28.220> year<00:04:28.580> on<00:04:28.760> all<00:04:29.030> of<00:04:29.240> the<00:04:29.330> alloy

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
models this year on all of the alloy

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:30.940 
models this year on all of the alloy
models<00:04:29.960> we<00:04:30.169> actually<00:04:30.440> lightened<00:04:30.860> up<00:04:30.889> the

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
models we actually lightened up the

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.550 
models we actually lightened up the
frames<00:04:31.280> so<00:04:31.880> we<00:04:31.970> pulled<00:04:32.180> about<00:04:32.300> 75<00:04:33.080> to<00:04:33.200> 100

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
frames so we pulled about 75 to 100

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.379 
frames so we pulled about 75 to 100
grams<00:04:33.770> out<00:04:34.010> of<00:04:34.190> the<00:04:34.340> the<00:04:34.760> standard<00:04:35.180> frame

there are one of the cool things that we
did<00:05:26.210> this<00:05:26.390> year<00:05:26.450> was<00:05:26.750> basically<00:05:27.260> start<00:05:27.800> with<00:05:27.919> a

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:27.950 
did this year was basically start with a

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
models but a tube top tubing down tube

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.100 
models but a tube top tubing down tube
with<00:05:36.830> pretty<00:05:37.340> wild<00:05:37.760> hydra<00:05:38.539> forms<00:05:38.840> on<00:05:39.020> the

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 
with pretty wild hydra forms on the

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.159 
with pretty wild hydra forms on the
tubes<00:05:39.350> on<00:05:40.039> the<00:05:40.220> top<00:05:40.430> end<00:05:40.640> frame<00:05:40.850> the<00:05:41.030> 720<00:05:41.750> we

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:42.169 
tubes on the top end frame the 720 we

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:43.620 
tubes on the top end frame the 720 we
actually<00:05:42.410> went<00:05:42.560> with<00:05:42.620> a<00:05:42.740> super<00:05:43.130> thin<00:05:43.370> wall

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:43.630 
actually went with a super thin wall

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:46.570 
actually went with a super thin wall
down<00:05:44.630> to<00:05:44.660> that's<00:05:45.440> actually<00:05:45.650> a<00:05:45.979> double<00:05:46.190> butted

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:46.580 
down to that's actually a double butted

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.190 
down to that's actually a double butted
down<00:05:46.729> tube<00:05:47.000> and<00:05:47.180> then<00:05:47.300> a<00:05:47.330> double<00:05:47.690> butted<00:05:47.990> top

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:48.200 
down tube and then a double butted top

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.070 
down tube and then a double butted top
tube<00:05:48.440> as<00:05:48.590> well<00:05:48.800> which<00:05:49.150> you<00:05:50.150> notice<00:05:50.660> the<00:05:50.750> Hydra

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
tube as well which you notice the Hydra

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.080 
tube as well which you notice the Hydra
forms<00:05:51.410> that<00:05:51.500> we<00:05:51.620> have<00:05:51.770> on<00:05:51.919> here<00:05:52.220> extremely

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.090 
forms that we have on here extremely

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.450 
forms that we have on here extremely
complex<00:05:53.539> and<00:05:54.289> the<00:05:54.350> advantage<00:05:54.770> of<00:05:54.860> this<00:05:55.010> is<00:05:55.220> it

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:55.460 
complex and the advantage of this is it

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.150 
complex and the advantage of this is it
can<00:05:55.669> give<00:05:55.820> us<00:05:55.940> a<00:05:56.180> lot<00:05:56.510> of<00:05:56.539> rigidity<00:05:56.900> but<00:05:57.830> still

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:58.160 
can give us a lot of rigidity but still

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.240 
can give us a lot of rigidity but still
providing<00:05:58.669> a<00:05:58.729> really<00:05:59.030> lightweight<00:05:59.360> frame

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:00.250 
providing a really lightweight frame

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:02.740 
providing a really lightweight frame
other<00:06:01.250> details<00:06:01.700> that<00:06:01.880> we<00:06:01.970> have<00:06:02.120> on<00:06:02.360> the<00:06:02.510> frame

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:02.750 
other details that we have on the frame

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:04.420 
other details that we have on the frame
as<00:06:02.960> well<00:06:03.110> that<00:06:03.350> make<00:06:03.500> it<00:06:03.620> cool<00:06:03.830> he<00:06:04.070> put<00:06:04.280> the

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:04.430 
as well that make it cool he put the

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.820 
as well that make it cool he put the
Hydra<00:06:04.940> forum<00:06:05.150> seat<00:06:05.390> station<00:06:05.930> actually<00:06:06.229> butted

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:06.830 
Hydra forum seat station actually butted

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.790 
Hydra forum seat station actually butted
seat<00:06:07.070> stays<00:06:07.400> and<00:06:07.729> then<00:06:08.330> fled<00:06:08.810> which<00:06:09.289> actually

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:09.800 
seat stays and then fled which actually

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.860 
seat stays and then fled which actually
allows<00:06:10.070> us<00:06:10.100> to<00:06:10.490> make<00:06:10.669> again<00:06:11.240> a<00:06:11.270> very<00:06:11.600> stiff

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:11.870 
allows us to make again a very stiff

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:13.340 
allows us to make again a very stiff
rear<00:06:12.080> triangle

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:13.350 
rear triangle

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:16.460 
rear triangle
so<00:06:13.800> underpowered<00:06:14.280> this<00:06:14.730> zero<00:06:15.510> flex<00:06:15.870> yet

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:16.470 
so underpowered this zero flex yet

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:17.840 
so underpowered this zero flex yet
actually<00:06:16.620> pull<00:06:16.950> a<00:06:16.980> lot<00:06:17.250> of<00:06:17.400> weight<00:06:17.550> out<00:06:17.790> of

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:17.850 
actually pull a lot of weight out of

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:20.480 
actually pull a lot of weight out of
