fashion<00:01:30.210> design<00:01:30.509> with<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.350> fisheye<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.070> i

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
fashion design with the fisheye and i

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.760 
fashion design with the fisheye and i
will<00:01:32.640> turn<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.299> fish<00:01:33.570> eye<00:01:33.689> on<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.200> off<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.590> on

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
will turn the fish eye on and off and on

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.920 
will turn the fish eye on and off and on
and<00:01:34.829> off<00:01:35.100> so<00:01:35.759> if<00:01:35.820> you<00:01:36.030> kind<00:01:36.180> of<00:01:36.299> see<00:01:36.600> the

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
and off so if you kind of see the

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:48.399 
and off so if you kind of see the
differences<00:01:38.600> so<00:01:39.600> it's<00:01:39.810> on<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.909> off<00:01:42.500> on<00:01:44.360> off<00:01:45.360> on

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:52.460 

so<00:01:49.409> what<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.280> fish<00:01:50.399> I<00:01:50.549> does<00:01:50.759> is<00:01:51.060> see<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:52.350> owl

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
so what the fish I does is see the owl

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.249 
so what the fish I does is see the owl
the<00:01:52.770> shirt<00:01:52.979> is<00:01:53.329> about<00:01:54.329> an<00:01:54.600> arm<00:01:54.869> lengths<00:01:55.229> away

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
the shirt is about an arm lengths away

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.730 
the shirt is about an arm lengths away
from<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.009> camera<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.579> then<00:01:57.270> when<00:01:57.719> I<00:01:57.750> put<00:01:58.619> the

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
from the camera and then when I put the

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.190 
from the camera and then when I put the
fish<00:01:58.890> eye<00:01:59.040> on<00:01:59.219> then<00:02:00.149> it<00:02:00.390> kind<00:02:00.540> of<00:02:00.570> pushes<00:02:00.780> it<00:02:01.049> a

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
fish eye on then it kind of pushes it a

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.450 
fish eye on then it kind of pushes it a
little<00:02:01.380> bit<00:02:01.530> further<00:02:01.680> back<00:02:01.920> but<00:02:02.189> then<00:02:02.340> it

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
little bit further back but then it

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.819 
little bit further back but then it
brings<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.759> other<00:02:02.939> stuff<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:04.110> little<00:02:04.740> bit

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
brings the other stuff a little bit

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.469 
brings the other stuff a little bit
closer<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.460> it<00:02:05.939> also<00:02:06.090> kind<00:02:06.600> of<00:02:07.220> alters<00:02:08.479> the

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
closer and it also kind of alters the

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.300 
closer and it also kind of alters the
borders<00:02:09.840> it's<00:02:10.140> kind<00:02:10.709> of<00:02:10.739> like<00:02:10.860> a<00:02:10.920> little

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
borders it's kind of like a little

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.800 
borders it's kind of like a little
surreal<00:02:11.700> stick

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
surreal stick

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.979 
surreal stick
blurry<00:02:13.470> vignette<00:02:13.980> which<00:02:14.489> adds<00:02:14.940> for<00:02:15.300> some<00:02:15.599> cool

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
blurry vignette which adds for some cool

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.420 
blurry vignette which adds for some cool
effects<00:02:16.349> um<00:02:16.830> and<00:02:17.660> let's<00:02:18.660> do<00:02:18.750> it<00:02:18.810> one<00:02:18.900> more<00:02:18.930> time

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
effects um and let's do it one more time

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:28.880 
effects um and let's do it one more time
off<00:02:21.410> on<00:02:23.450> off<00:02:24.450> on<00:02:27.170> so<00:02:28.170> that's<00:02:28.500> pretty<00:02:28.650> much<00:02:28.739> it
