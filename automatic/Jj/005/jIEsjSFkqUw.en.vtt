actually see it totally perfectly down
here<00:01:13.890> these<00:01:14.369> things<00:01:14.970> but<00:01:15.900> at<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.200> top<00:01:16.470> it

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
here these things but at the top it

here these things but at the top it
works<00:01:17.880> pretty<00:01:18.090> good<00:01:18.210> especially<00:01:19.140> with<00:01:19.799> the

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
works pretty good especially with the

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.219 
works pretty good especially with the
with<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.460> clock<00:01:20.790> here<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.390> you<00:01:21.720> can<00:01:21.930> see

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
with the clock here and you can see

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.990 
with the clock here and you can see
things<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.680> you<00:01:22.830> have<00:01:23.009> missed<00:01:23.310> if<00:01:23.580> you<00:01:23.700> push

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
things that you have missed if you push

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.880 
things that you have missed if you push
on<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.330> power<00:01:24.540> button<00:01:24.720> but<00:01:25.320> it's<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.680> little

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
on the power button but it's a little

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.190 
on the power button but it's a little
bit<00:01:26.070> slim<00:01:26.369> there<00:01:26.720> compared<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:28.049> original

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
bit slim there compared to the original

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.940 
bit slim there compared to the original
one<00:01:28.799> that<00:01:29.070> you<00:01:29.310> do<00:01:29.460> get<00:01:29.930> from<00:01:30.930> from<00:01:31.500> something

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
one that you do get from from something

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.990 
one that you do get from from something
themselves<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:33.020> but<00:01:34.020> for<00:01:34.950> significations<00:01:35.850> up

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
themselves and but for significations up

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.420 
themselves and but for significations up
there<00:01:36.180> it<00:01:36.420> does<00:01:36.689> work<00:01:37.020> so<00:01:37.680> what<00:01:38.040> I<00:01:38.070> do<00:01:38.159> like

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
there it does work so what I do like

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.249 
there it does work so what I do like
about<00:01:38.490> this<00:01:38.939> one<00:01:39.000> compared<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.780> some<00:01:40.020> things

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
about this one compared to some things

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.740 
about this one compared to some things
original<00:01:40.799> one<00:01:40.950> is<00:01:41.189> this<00:01:41.520> one<00:01:41.579> do<00:01:42.360> actually

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
original one is this one do actually

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.350 
original one is this one do actually
fully<00:01:43.079> closed<00:01:43.590> when<00:01:44.549> you<00:01:44.579> close<00:01:44.880> it<00:01:44.909> like<00:01:45.149> this

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
fully closed when you close it like this

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.319 
fully closed when you close it like this
it's<00:01:46.200> not<00:01:46.320> magnetic<00:01:46.710> if<00:01:47.130> you<00:01:47.399> are<00:01:47.729> wondering

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329

little bit up then you will be able to

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.970 
little bit up then you will be able to
take<00:03:12.700> pictures<00:03:13.209> in<00:03:13.450> there<00:03:13.630> thing<00:03:13.989> with<00:03:14.829> this

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980

take pictures in there thing with this
one<00:03:15.190> home<00:03:15.400> so<00:03:15.760> that<00:03:16.000> could<00:03:16.299> be<00:03:16.329> a<00:03:16.810> nice<00:03:17.530> little

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
one home so that could be a nice little

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:23.699 
one home so that could be a nice little
addition<00:03:17.920> there<00:03:21.870> so<00:03:22.870> let's<00:03:23.290> take<00:03:23.380> a<00:03:23.440> look<00:03:23.650> at

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709

addition there so let's take a look at
those<00:03:23.980> other<00:03:24.310> color<00:03:24.790> variants<00:03:28.049> so<00:03:29.049> as<00:03:29.440> I<00:03:29.799> said

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
those other color variants so as I said

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:43.790 
those other color variants so as I said
we<00:03:30.190> do<00:03:30.310> also<00:03:30.519> have<00:03:30.760> the<00:03:31.260> wrong<00:03:32.260> edition<00:03:32.889> here

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:04:02.330 

this<00:03:44.800> is<00:03:44.920> how<00:03:45.069> this<00:03:45.280> that<00:03:45.670> one<00:03:45.940> do<00:03:46.300> looks<00:03:46.630> like

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.949 

now<00:04:03.340> let's<00:04:03.700> take<00:04:03.849> a<00:04:03.909> look<00:04:04.030> at<00:04:04.209> the<00:04:04.299> final<00:04:04.720> color

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:37.030 
now let's take a look at the final color
here<00:04:06.659> which<00:04:07.659> is<00:04:07.930> the<00:04:08.440> black<00:04:08.980> edition

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.890 

and<00:04:37.700> I<00:04:37.820> would<00:04:37.970> say<00:04:38.000> that<00:04:38.120> this<00:04:38.300> could<00:04:38.570> be<00:04:38.720> kind

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
and I would say that this could be kind

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.300 
and I would say that this could be kind
of<00:04:38.990> useful<00:04:39.170> for<00:04:39.440> lot<00:04:39.560> of<00:04:39.620> people<00:04:39.980> if<00:04:40.070> you<00:04:40.130> don't
