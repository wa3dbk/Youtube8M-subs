00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:18.740
 luis will have the mission which we 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.740
 we will take the 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.840
 well, you do not know 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.240
 It will be difficult to know great jewel because 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.330
 they have many and if I have a lot 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.990
 is that 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.990
 one 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.660
 it came well pro truth 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.920
 good but I did not always install it using 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.570
 because I think they will be given a little 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.570
 annoyed that I had a lot 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.640
 like right now 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.640
 will see which markets would start 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.570
 and they gave me money for doing one thing 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.570
 which is called the beginning 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.149
 of coloring 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:04.809
 well this was going to throw me the other time 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:06.670
 in others I do not have a cell phone and it was 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.509
 next I was going to install a rom and 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.509
 i made it 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:20.170
 good and as I was cleared to take 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:22.810
 the mission 89 euros simply for 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.630
 humiliate a breakthrough since I never 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:29.040
 it will only happen in a video game 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.040
 the good stories 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:33.070
 Clear 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:45.910
 that produce zinc stand out 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:47.960
 good and this is the mission one that I know 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:50.000
 does a lot of testing is between 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.150
 boring I do not want to leave the story 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.150
 why 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.790
 in this part I like 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:11.260
 the thinkers like after this 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:16.300
 It depends 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:19.090
 goes up goes up and then the boy 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.560
 I do not know if I have to follow this guy 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:26.980
 I'm this guy 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.980
 He said today as he says 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:31.299
 Right 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:43.000
 order 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.000
 here was the band star 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:53.220
 but I'm also making money 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:57.090
 doing acrobatics and it was not one of 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:59.340
 two easy then all the tricks every two 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.100
 for three and get me the money and be 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.480
 buying houses 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:06.110
 It will also cost us my effort and 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.110
 everything 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:12.980
 the weapons have also been able to 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.980
 buying with the same money 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:21.530
 well the three were chasing this 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:26.800
 give him cane as 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.800
 we follow him and we continue uy 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:34.030
 and this node 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.240
 clog and square 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.909
 run leads me 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.470

 run with him 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.109
 and I always ask myself as a general if 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:07.829
 they have or not there are no children one thing 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:07.829
 pretty weird 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.340
 these brunettes 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:23.160
 we should wait for riders 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.669
 game that likes croquettes 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:36.040
 run in the wastelands the objective 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:43.010
 or rei where in during both incoming 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.730
 well here was there was a boom let's say like 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.730
 victorious there 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.850

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:12.940
 already ready mission your program some 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.940
 long missions which is what even the 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.669
 and good 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.669

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:46.889
 if I can and if not mature soften that 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:48.419
 I come a lot a lot exactly 

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:50.600
 obviously up to two retransmissions to 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:50.600
 day 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:06:00.900
 and well we let in or there is something that 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.890
 you are not going to consider as a trap 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.890
 do not write 

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:16.979
 at home 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:16.979

 well then 

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:40.150
 to be super better nothing difficult 

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:43.590
 but you can not good like that nationally 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.590
 you want to spend what happens to your house 

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:48.790
 those states 

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:56.360
 the same so that they always have it 

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:03.560
 I can not believe fire 

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:13.780
