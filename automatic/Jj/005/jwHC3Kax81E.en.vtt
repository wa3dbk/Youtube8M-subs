carrying and how much weight it with the
subwoofers<00:01:31.180> a<00:01:31.510> little<00:01:31.810> over<00:01:32.170> 40<00:01:32.650> pounds<00:01:33.010> 40

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:33.550 
subwoofers a little over 40 pounds 40

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:34.860 
subwoofers a little over 40 pounds 40
foot<00:01:33.670> but<00:01:33.850> it's<00:01:33.970> still<00:01:34.090> just<00:01:34.150> a<00:01:34.390> two-handed

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:34.870 
foot but it's still just a two-handed

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.810 
foot but it's still just a two-handed
lift<00:01:35.110> and<00:01:35.440> it's<00:01:35.890> quite<00:01:36.070> simple<00:01:36.220> we<00:01:36.460> also<00:01:36.610> make

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
lift and it's quite simple we also make

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.760 
lift and it's quite simple we also make
a<00:01:36.850> caster<00:01:37.360> board<00:01:37.600> or<00:01:38.020> the<00:01:38.110> subwoofer<00:01:38.590> so<00:01:38.710> if

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
a caster board or the subwoofer so if

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.150 
you want to roll it in you can do that

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.600 
you want to roll it in you can do that
well<00:01:40.570> now<00:01:41.500> we're<00:01:41.650> looking<00:01:41.740> at<00:01:41.950> what<00:01:42.010> now<00:01:42.460> does

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
well now we're looking at what now does

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:43.860 
well now we're looking at what now does
it<00:01:42.670> come<00:01:42.820> in<00:01:42.910> any<00:01:43.060> of<00:01:43.150> the<00:01:43.240> color<00:01:43.390> absolutely

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:43.870 
it come in any of the color absolutely

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.080 
it come in any of the color absolutely
white<00:01:44.110> or<00:01:44.350> black<00:01:44.620> all<00:01:45.250> our<00:01:45.370> systems<00:01:45.760> come<00:01:45.970> in

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
white or black all our systems come in

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.030 
white or black all our systems come in
both<00:01:46.270> colors<00:01:46.660> so<00:01:46.900> for<00:01:47.110> those<00:01:47.230> events<00:01:47.650> that

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 
both colors so for those events that

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.440 
both colors so for those events that
again<00:01:48.310> you<00:01:48.430> really<00:01:48.610> want<00:01:48.850> this<00:01:48.910> to<00:01:49.060> blend<00:01:49.300> into

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
again you really want this to blend into

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.870 
again you really want this to blend into
a<00:01:49.630> background<00:01:50.110> and<00:01:50.470> make<00:01:51.400> it<00:01:51.520> look<00:01:51.640> kind<00:01:51.790> of

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
a background and make it look kind of

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.360 
a background and make it look kind of
sheet<00:01:52.120> and<00:01:52.360> white<00:01:52.930> is<00:01:53.110> a<00:01:53.140> perfect<00:01:53.560> choice<00:01:54.340> for

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:54.370 
sheet and white is a perfect choice for

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:55.850 
sheet and white is a perfect choice for
sure<00:01:54.910> or

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
sure or

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.860 
sure or
in<00:01:56.010> connectivity<00:01:56.610> now<00:01:56.940> what<00:01:57.210> yes<00:01:57.390> connections

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:57.870 
in connectivity now what yes connections

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.870 
in connectivity now what yes connections
we<00:01:58.020> have<00:01:58.050> on<00:01:58.260> the<00:01:58.320> back<00:01:58.440> the<00:01:58.800> back<00:01:59.010> has<00:01:59.340> combi

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
we have on the back the back has combi

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.760 
we have on the back the back has combi
connectors<00:02:00.300> which<00:02:00.510> means<00:02:00.780> it's<00:02:01.200> your<00:02:01.320> XLR

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
connectors which means it's your XLR

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.610 
connectors which means it's your XLR
connectors<00:02:02.220> or<00:02:02.490> quarter-inch<00:02:03.030> stereo<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:04.140> a

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:04.620 
connectors or quarter-inch stereo and a

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:05.960 
connectors or quarter-inch stereo and a
separate<00:02:04.890> flow<00:02:05.100> no<00:02:05.160> connector<00:02:05.640> so<00:02:05.730> you<00:02:05.790> could

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
separate flow no connector so you could

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.850 
separate flow no connector so you could
actually<00:02:06.090> take<00:02:06.750> a<00:02:06.780> cell<00:02:07.080> phone<00:02:07.260> plug<00:02:07.560> it<00:02:07.710> right

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
actually take a cell phone plug it right

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.940 
actually take a cell phone plug it right
into<00:02:08.040> the<00:02:08.190> back<00:02:08.369> of<00:02:08.400> this<00:02:08.640> and<00:02:08.790> you<00:02:08.880> have<00:02:09.030> news
