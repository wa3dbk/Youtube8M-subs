hey what's going on guys today we're

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.250 
hey what's going on guys today we're
going<00:00:07.390> to<00:00:07.480> be<00:00:07.540> showing<00:00:07.690> you<00:00:07.810> how<00:00:07.900> to<00:00:07.930> connect

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:08.260 
going to be showing you how to connect

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.350 
going to be showing you how to connect
your<00:00:08.290> ps3<00:00:08.500> to<00:00:08.889> the<00:00:08.980> internet<00:00:09.309> via<00:00:09.610> an<00:00:09.820> Ethernet

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:10.360 
your ps3 to the internet via an Ethernet

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:10.770 
your ps3 to the internet via an Ethernet
cable

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:10.780 
cable

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:11.820 
cable
now<00:00:10.900> that's<00:00:11.049> the<00:00:11.110> same<00:00:11.260> thing<00:00:11.440> as<00:00:11.559> a<00:00:11.590> wired

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:11.830 
now that's the same thing as a wired

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.129 
now that's the same thing as a wired
connection<00:00:12.539> so<00:00:13.539> if<00:00:13.629> you<00:00:13.719> have<00:00:13.840> a<00:00:13.869> wireless

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:14.139 
connection so if you have a wireless

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:16.380 
connection so if you have a wireless
router<00:00:14.440> but<00:00:14.740> you<00:00:15.219> think<00:00:15.459> the<00:00:15.670> signals<00:00:16.090> kind<00:00:16.299> of

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:16.390 
router but you think the signals kind of

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.170 
router but you think the signals kind of
not<00:00:17.020> as<00:00:17.140> good<00:00:17.350> or<00:00:17.560> you're<00:00:18.310> lagging<00:00:18.490> a<00:00:18.760> lot<00:00:18.910> go

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:19.180 
not as good or you're lagging a lot go

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.240 
not as good or you're lagging a lot go
ahead<00:00:19.330> and<00:00:19.420> plug<00:00:20.110> in<00:00:20.140> an<00:00:20.289> Ethernet<00:00:20.650> cable<00:00:20.770> from

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.250 
ahead and plug in an Ethernet cable from

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.910 
ahead and plug in an Ethernet cable from
your<00:00:21.310> router<00:00:21.490> in<00:00:22.030> your<00:00:22.090> ps3<00:00:22.780> and<00:00:23.620> you<00:00:23.710> can<00:00:23.830> use

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:23.920 
your router in your ps3 and you can use

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.260 
your router in your ps3 and you can use
the<00:00:24.040> wired<00:00:24.220> connection<00:00:24.280> get<00:00:24.820> a<00:00:24.850> stable

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:25.270 
the wired connection get a stable

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:30.030 
the wired connection get a stable
connection<00:00:25.500> without<00:00:26.500> much<00:00:27.310> lag<00:00:27.610> and<00:00:28.530> so<00:00:29.530> let's

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:30.040 
connection without much lag and so let's

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.860 
connection without much lag and so let's
get<00:00:30.220> started<00:00:30.550> on<00:00:30.670> showing<00:00:31.539> you<00:00:31.630> how<00:00:31.690> to<00:00:31.780> do

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:31.870 
get started on showing you how to do

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:34.200 
get started on showing you how to do
this<00:00:31.990> so<00:00:32.230> first<00:00:33.100> of<00:00:33.370> course<00:00:33.520> you<00:00:33.640> want<00:00:33.879> to<00:00:33.940> plug

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.210 
this so first of course you want to plug

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.060 
this so first of course you want to plug
the<00:00:34.450> ethernet<00:00:34.480> cable<00:00:34.960> from<00:00:35.320> your<00:00:35.379> router<00:00:35.530> into

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 
the ethernet cable from your router into

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.389 
the ethernet cable from your router into
your<00:00:36.190> ps3<00:00:36.839> on<00:00:37.839> the<00:00:37.929> back<00:00:38.050> of<00:00:38.170> the<00:00:38.230> ps3<00:00:38.679> there<00:00:39.159> is

00:00:39.389 --> 00:00:39.399 
your ps3 on the back of the ps3 there is

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:41.849 
your ps3 on the back of the ps3 there is
not<00:00:39.609> a<00:00:39.909> little<00:00:40.659> light<00:00:40.809> that<00:00:41.019> flashes<00:00:41.559> like

00:00:41.849 --> 00:00:41.859 
not a little light that flashes like

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:44.369 
not a little light that flashes like
with<00:00:42.010> some<00:00:42.370> laptops<00:00:42.899> so<00:00:43.899> let's<00:00:44.019> plug<00:00:44.199> it<00:00:44.319> in

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:44.379 
with some laptops so let's plug it in

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:46.349 
with some laptops so let's plug it in
until<00:00:44.710> it<00:00:44.800> clicks<00:00:44.829> and<00:00:45.399> make<00:00:45.999> sure<00:00:46.120> you're<00:00:46.239> not

00:00:46.349 --> 00:00:46.359 
until it clicks and make sure you're not

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:48.899 
until it clicks and make sure you're not
using<00:00:46.420> a<00:00:46.989> phone<00:00:47.859> cable<00:00:48.159> because<00:00:48.579> those<00:00:48.789> are

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:48.909 
using a phone cable because those are

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:51.090 
using a phone cable because those are
completely<00:00:49.420> different<00:00:49.589> the<00:00:50.589> phone<00:00:50.769> cable<00:00:51.039> is

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
completely different the phone cable is

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.680 
completely different the phone cable is
a<00:00:51.129> little<00:00:51.339> bit<00:00:51.429> smaller<00:00:51.729> as<00:00:52.030> opposed<00:00:52.420> to<00:00:52.569> the

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
a little bit smaller as opposed to the

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.329 
a little bit smaller as opposed to the
ethernet<00:00:53.019> cable<00:00:53.140> which<00:00:53.379> is<00:00:53.530> a<00:00:53.800> little<00:00:54.280> bit

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:54.339 
ethernet cable which is a little bit

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:57.660 
ethernet cable which is a little bit
bigger<00:00:54.579> so<00:00:55.739> now<00:00:56.739> on<00:00:56.859> your<00:00:56.979> ps3<00:00:57.190> go<00:00:57.460> to<00:00:57.519> the

to check the network configuration now

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.770 
to check the network configuration now
this<00:01:44.230> could<00:01:44.500> take<00:01:44.680> from<00:01:45.250> like<00:01:45.640> 30<00:01:45.940> seconds<00:01:46.450> to

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.710 
this could take from like 30 seconds to
maybe<00:01:47.170> a<00:01:47.530> few<00:01:48.040> minutes<00:01:48.370> even<00:01:48.550> source<00:01:49.540> be

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
maybe a few minutes even source be

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.870 
maybe a few minutes even source be
patient<00:01:50.080> with<00:01:50.170> it<00:01:50.200> don't<00:01:50.500> cancel<00:01:50.710> it<00:01:50.980> I<00:01:51.190> just

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
patient with it don't cancel it I just

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.390 
patient with it don't cancel it I just
let<00:01:52.000> it<00:01:52.030> do<00:01:52.180> its<00:01:52.210> thing

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:53.400 
let it do its thing

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.980 
let it do its thing
ok<00:01:54.400> now<00:01:54.580> really<00:01:55.120> the<00:01:55.240> only<00:01:55.420> setting<00:01:55.780> that<00:01:55.900> it's

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
ok now really the only setting that it's

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.620 
ok now really the only setting that it's
going<00:01:56.110> to<00:01:56.170> ask<00:01:56.350> for<00:01:56.650> if<00:01:56.770> you've<00:01:56.950> if<00:01:57.250> is<00:01:57.790> if<00:01:58.450> you

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
going to ask for if you've if is if you

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.860 
going to ask for if you've if is if you
want<00:01:58.840> to<00:01:58.900> use<00:01:59.080> a<00:01:59.110> proxy<00:01:59.500> server<00:01:59.730> if<00:02:00.730> you<00:02:00.909> don't

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:01.870 
want to use a proxy server if you don't

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:03.990 
want to use a proxy server if you don't
know<00:02:02.050> what<00:02:02.710> a<00:02:02.740> proxy<00:02:02.950> server<00:02:03.310> is<00:02:03.460> then<00:02:03.760> just

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
know what a proxy server is then just

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.340 
know what a proxy server is then just
choose<00:02:04.180> do<00:02:04.360> not<00:02:04.420> use<00:02:04.690> because<00:02:04.840> you<00:02:04.990> probably

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
choose do not use because you probably

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.350 
choose do not use because you probably
do<00:02:05.500> not<00:02:05.650> have<00:02:05.710> one<00:02:06.130> if<00:02:06.760> you<00:02:06.909> have<00:02:07.150> a<00:02:07.180> practice

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
do not have one if you have a practice

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.759 
do not have one if you have a practice
server<00:02:07.720> and<00:02:07.900> you<00:02:07.990> know<00:02:08.080> you're<00:02:08.289> doing<00:02:08.470> go<00:02:08.679> and

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:08.769 
server and you know you're doing go and

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:10.770 
server and you know you're doing go and
choose<00:02:08.920> use<00:02:09.220> and<00:02:09.550> put<00:02:09.879> in<00:02:10.030> of<00:02:10.420> course<00:02:10.479> the

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
choose use and put in of course the

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.760 
choose use and put in of course the
server<00:02:11.050> your<00:02:12.300> login<00:02:13.300> credentials<00:02:13.840> so<00:02:14.650> we're

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
server your login credentials so we're

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.100 
server your login credentials so we're
going<00:02:14.920> to<00:02:14.980> choose<00:02:15.130> do<00:02:15.310> not<00:02:15.340> use<00:02:15.670> and<00:02:16.390> that's

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
going to choose do not use and that's

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.450 
going to choose do not use and that's
basically<00:02:17.410> it<00:02:17.620> so<00:02:17.650> we<00:02:17.890> can<00:02:18.010> just<00:02:18.100> go<00:02:18.220> by

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
basically it so we can just go by

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.280 
basically it so we can just go by
x2<00:02:18.880> save<00:02:19.120> the<00:02:19.240> setting<00:02:19.540> and<00:02:19.750> as<00:02:19.960> all<00:02:20.140> the

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
x2 save the setting and as all the

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.860 
x2 save the setting and as all the
things<00:02:20.640> set<00:02:21.640> up<00:02:21.670> as<00:02:21.940> automatic<00:02:22.510> so<00:02:22.690> it's<00:02:22.810> just

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
things set up as automatic so it's just

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.120 
things set up as automatic so it's just
going<00:02:23.020> to<00:02:23.110> automatically<00:02:23.500> detect<00:02:23.830> everything

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
going to automatically detect everything

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.760 
going to automatically detect everything
so<00:02:25.030> we'll<00:02:25.150> just<00:02:25.330> go<00:02:25.420> and<00:02:25.480> press<00:02:25.690> X<00:02:25.990> to<00:02:26.290> save<00:02:26.620> it

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
so we'll just go and press X to save it

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.030 
so we'll just go and press X to save it
and<00:02:26.920> then<00:02:27.520> to<00:02:28.210> test<00:02:28.510> your<00:02:28.660> connection<00:02:29.020> you<00:02:29.860> can

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
and then to test your connection you can

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.380 
and then to test your connection you can
test<00:02:30.340> your<00:02:30.490> connection<00:02:30.820> if<00:02:30.910> you<00:02:31.000> really<00:02:31.210> want

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
test your connection if you really want

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.660 
test your connection if you really want
to<00:02:31.570> if<00:02:31.690> you<00:02:31.810> want<00:02:31.960> to<00:02:32.110> try<00:02:33.070> to<00:02:33.130> solve<00:02:33.430> some

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
to if you want to try to solve some

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.430
