00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:10.480 

I<00:00:04.660> think<00:00:05.660> that<00:00:05.960> what's<00:00:06.410> provided<00:00:07.160> is<00:00:09.190> is<00:00:10.190> very

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:10.490 
I think that what's provided is is very

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.060 
I think that what's provided is is very
necessary<00:00:10.700> here<00:00:11.389> and<00:00:11.600> I<00:00:12.139> think<00:00:12.469> the<00:00:12.680> character

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:13.070 
necessary here and I think the character

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.070 
necessary here and I think the character
classes<00:00:13.580> and<00:00:14.030> I<00:00:14.090> think<00:00:14.360> that<00:00:14.510> the<00:00:14.660> acting

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:15.080 
classes and I think that the acting

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.800 
classes and I think that the acting
classes<00:00:15.350> and<00:00:16.070> and<00:00:16.430> the<00:00:16.789> variation<00:00:17.360> classes

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:17.810 
classes and and the variation classes

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.620 
classes and and the variation classes
and<00:00:17.960> the<00:00:18.020> contemporary<00:00:18.350> classes<00:00:19.130> I<00:00:20.000> think

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:20.630 
and the contemporary classes I think

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.320 
and the contemporary classes I think
that<00:00:20.840> that<00:00:21.170> is<00:00:21.560> an<00:00:21.920> indication<00:00:22.580> that<00:00:22.790> it's<00:00:23.120> a

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.330 
that that is an indication that it's a

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.480 
that that is an indication that it's a
very<00:00:23.810> serious<00:00:24.230> Academy<00:00:24.740> well<00:00:25.130> it's<00:00:25.340> really

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:25.490
