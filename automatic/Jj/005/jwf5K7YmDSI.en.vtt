00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
running 1350 CC class pre 1956 so it's

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.880 
running 1350 CC class pre 1956 so it's
all<00:00:23.130> mostly<00:00:24.090> you<00:00:24.900> know<00:00:24.930> panhead<00:00:25.410> knuckleheads

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.400 
maybe some Indian stuff I don't know but

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.250 
maybe some Indian stuff I don't know but
it'll<00:00:29.400> be<00:00:29.550> fun<00:00:29.670> to<00:00:29.820> run<00:00:29.970> a<00:00:30.029> triumph<00:00:30.630> against

it'll be fun to run a triumph against

it'll be fun to run a triumph against
that<00:00:31.439> home<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:31.769> hopefully<00:00:32.309> knock<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.489> couple

that home and hopefully knock a couple
of<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.210> books<00:00:33.360> records<00:00:35.000> the<00:00:36.000> just<00:00:36.630> the

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
of the books records the just the

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.420 
of the books records the just the
complexity<00:00:37.350> of<00:00:37.380> everything<00:00:37.829> I<00:00:38.010> mean<00:00:38.250> I<00:00:38.340> had

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
complexity of everything I mean I had

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.030 
complexity of everything I mean I had
trouble<00:00:39.020> wrapping<00:00:40.020> my<00:00:40.290> head<00:00:40.469> around

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
trouble wrapping my head around

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.130 
trouble wrapping my head around
I<00:00:41.190> had<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.000> tackle<00:00:42.510> one<00:00:42.719> thing<00:00:42.930> at<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.110> time

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
I had to tackle one thing at a time

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.889 
I had to tackle one thing at a time
because<00:00:43.800> there<00:00:44.040> are<00:00:44.129> so<00:00:44.250> many<00:00:44.480> components<00:00:45.480> and

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
because there are so many components and

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.290 
because there are so many components and
things<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.200> think<00:00:46.289> about<00:00:46.940> and<00:00:47.940> it<00:00:48.030> was<00:00:48.149> all<00:00:48.210> in

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
things to think about and it was all in

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.119 
things to think about and it was all in
my<00:00:48.329> head<00:00:48.539> I<00:00:48.570> don't<00:00:48.809> don't<00:00:49.289> make<00:00:49.440> many<00:00:49.620> lists<00:00:50.010> or

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
my head I don't don't make many lists or

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.799 
my head I don't don't make many lists or
anything<00:00:50.280> I<00:00:50.460> just<00:00:50.489> was<00:00:50.850> it<00:00:51.360> was<00:00:51.449> hard<00:00:51.570> for<00:00:51.750> me

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
anything I just was it was hard for me

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.450 
anything I just was it was hard for me
to<00:00:51.899> focus<00:00:52.050> on<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.530> whole<00:00:52.800> picture<00:00:53.039> because<00:00:53.280> it

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
to focus on the whole picture because it

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.709 
to focus on the whole picture because it
was<00:00:53.550> overwhelming<00:00:54.059> so<00:00:54.390> I<00:00:54.449> was<00:00:54.570> just<00:00:54.770> trying<00:00:55.770> to

00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:56.719 
was overwhelming so I was just trying to

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:01.549 
was overwhelming so I was just trying to
get<00:00:57.719> one<00:00:58.160> task<00:00:59.160> or<00:00:59.460> function<00:00:59.719> done<00:01:00.719> so<00:01:01.500> it

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
get one task or function done so it

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:02.510 
get one task or function done so it
would<00:01:01.649> work<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:02.010> not<00:01:02.129> interfere<00:01:02.340> with

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
would work and not interfere with

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.160 
would work and not interfere with
everything<00:01:02.820> else<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.300> just<00:01:03.510> do<00:01:03.780> that<00:01:03.930> every

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
everything else and just do that every

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.460 
everything else and just do that every
day<00:01:05.040> over<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:05.939> over<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.150> over<00:01:06.320> there's<00:01:07.320> just

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
day over and over and over there's just

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.469 
day over and over and over there's just
a<00:01:07.530> ton<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:07.890> thought<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:09.229> time<00:01:11.090> the<00:01:12.090> ignition

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
a ton of thought and time the ignition

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.670 
a ton of thought and time the ignition
on<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.689> bike<00:01:12.869> is<00:01:13.610> Morris<00:01:14.900> Magneto's<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.170> they

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
on the bike is Morris Magneto's and they

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.280 
on the bike is Morris Magneto's and they
just<00:01:17.310> started<00:01:17.640> making<00:01:17.900> triumphs<00:01:18.900> per<00:01:19.049> unit

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
just started making triumphs per unit

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.929 
just started making triumphs per unit
Magneto's<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:19.890> I<00:01:19.920> got<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.250> of<00:01:20.430> probably<00:01:20.880> the

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
Magneto's and I got to of probably the

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.440 
Magneto's and I got to of probably the
first<00:01:21.150> ones<00:01:21.680> and<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:23.040> heads<00:01:23.670> on<00:01:23.909> both<00:01:24.119> motors

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
first ones and the heads on both motors

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.969 
first ones and the heads on both motors
are<00:01:24.570> dual<00:01:24.720> plugged<00:01:25.020> so<00:01:25.320> there's<00:01:25.470> four<00:01:25.710> plugs

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
are dual plugged so there's four plugs

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.749 
are dual plugged so there's four plugs
on<00:01:26.369> each<00:01:26.549> motor<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:27.060> I<00:01:27.509> run<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.750> Morris<00:01:28.759> single

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
on each motor and I run a Morris single

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.370 
on each motor and I run a Morris single
fire<00:01:29.909> wire<00:01:30.180> kit<00:01:30.420> I<00:01:30.600> run<00:01:30.780> four<00:01:30.990> of<00:01:31.140> them

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
fire wire kit I run four of them

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.499 
fire wire kit I run four of them
so<00:01:31.680> each<00:01:31.920> Magneto<00:01:32.400> fires<00:01:32.640> four<00:01:33.000> spark<00:01:33.270> plugs

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
so each Magneto fires four spark plugs

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.050 
so each Magneto fires four spark plugs
and<00:01:33.750> they're<00:01:34.740> timed<00:01:35.009> exactly<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.520> same<00:01:35.759> and

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
and they're timed exactly the same and

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.990 
and they're timed exactly the same and
so<00:01:36.930> when<00:01:37.049> I<00:01:37.079> link<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.380> motor<00:01:37.579> both<00:01:38.579> motors<00:01:38.880> are

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
so when I link the motor both motors are

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.600 
so when I link the motor both motors are
identical<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:39.479> know<00:01:39.630> so<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:40.140> fires<00:01:40.680> its

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
identical you know so it fires its

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.399 
identical you know so it fires its
firing<00:01:41.939> you<00:01:42.090> know<00:01:42.210> all<00:01:42.600> eight<00:01:42.780> plugs<00:01:43.079> off<00:01:43.259> the

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
firing you know all eight plugs off the

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.100 
firing you know all eight plugs off the
two<00:01:43.560> Magneto's<00:01:44.040> so<00:01:44.670> they<00:01:44.790> run<00:01:44.939> in<00:01:45.060> same<00:01:45.270> the

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
two Magneto's so they run in same the

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.940 
two Magneto's so they run in same the
the<00:01:46.140> wheels<00:01:46.740> on<00:01:46.920> that<00:01:46.950> bike<00:01:47.250> are<00:01:47.430> interesting

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
the wheels on that bike are interesting

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.100 
the wheels on that bike are interesting
