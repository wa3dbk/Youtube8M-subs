is very little of the game shown there's
going<00:01:09.100> to<00:01:09.159> be<00:01:09.189> more<00:01:09.369> scene<00:01:09.579> in<00:01:09.670> about<00:01:09.820> two

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
going to be more scene in about two

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.149 
going to be more scene in about two
weeks<00:01:10.060> but<00:01:10.509> what<00:01:10.960> I<00:01:10.990> can<00:01:11.229> say<00:01:11.259> its<00:01:11.590> a<00:01:11.649> mix<00:01:11.890> of

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
weeks but what I can say its a mix of

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:15.210 
weeks but what I can say its a mix of
the<00:01:13.060> ideals<00:01:13.420> of<00:01:13.540> a<00:01:13.630> game<00:01:13.780> like<00:01:13.899> limbo<00:01:14.290> with

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
the ideals of a game like limbo with

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.670 
the ideals of a game like limbo with
something<00:01:15.460> like<00:01:15.579> Final<00:01:15.850> Fantasy<00:01:15.939> 6<00:01:16.560> but<00:01:17.560> it's

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
something like Final Fantasy 6 but it's

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.800 
something like Final Fantasy 6 but it's
using<00:01:17.920> the<00:01:17.950> UV<00:01:18.310> art<00:01:18.520> framework<00:01:19.090> engine<00:01:19.540> so

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
using the UV art framework engine so

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.200 
using the UV art framework engine so
it's<00:01:20.079> kind<00:01:20.320> of<00:01:20.350> gonna<00:01:20.469> have<00:01:20.710> a<00:01:20.740> similar<00:01:21.280> style

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:49.899 
it's it's been in development i think

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:51.630 
it's it's been in development i think
for<00:01:50.380> i<00:01:50.590> want<00:01:50.770> to<00:01:50.829> say<00:01:50.920> about<00:01:51.009> two<00:01:51.189> years<00:01:51.369> now<00:01:51.520> i

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
for i want to say about two years now i

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.399
