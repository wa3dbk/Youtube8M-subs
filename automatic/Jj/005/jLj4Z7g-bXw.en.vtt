00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:19.589
 the knowledge of free makes you gift 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:20.849
 another in your interesting transform 

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:23.759
 your phone in a receiver 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:26.039
 panoramic using a meter for that 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:28.619
 digital TV reception with one 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.570
 specific microprocessor will have between the 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.610
 hands a receiver that has nothing to 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.280
 envy to the most noble and expensive 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.680
 commercial products the only precaution 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.470
 to take laws into account 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.050
 in force in your country for listening 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.120
 of institutional frequencies I apologize for 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.340
 sometimes non-animal translation for 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.360
 the use of automatic systems 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.520
 in any case equally understandable ok 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.770
 this had to happen before later with 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.780
 the introduction of some very powerful 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:02.070
 android tablet last year in the 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:05.100
 price range 199 as the nexus 7 kg e 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.649
 say is the samsung galaxy tab is joined the 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.490
 availability of inexpensive to rtl 

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:13.799
 ghioni and 832 ugari a2a hera sdr e 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.719
 slows down what someone could do 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.569
 a mash up of the two sooner or later the 

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:21.149
 result is a bond called sdr 

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:22.950
 touch of marine margin at this time 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:25.560
 the application is still in the process of 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.369
 development but is now available from the site 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.100
 of martin 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.229
 This is why everything we say 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.710
 here can change in the next five 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.009
 minutes 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:38.149
 in a nutshell sgr pa allows us to 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:41.759
 connect a flash drive trust rtl 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:44.670
 2.832 or via your USB port 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.740
 android device and sdr fees allows 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.340
 to synchronize and decode the audio 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.850
 of the cipe 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:54.850
 she basically adducts 32 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.710
 have her sign up dr portable radio for 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.659
 less than 10 dollars 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.119
 the other important factor to 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.670
 consider that fdr touch shows that 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.860
 sdr can be implemented by a 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.590
 small process go to battery 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.299
 sdr technology also opens the door 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.849
 for the possibility of development of 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:15.129
 free touch screen applications 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:18.400
 radio sampling direct as 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:19.030
 analyzer of seven to use sdr 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.950
 touch 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:25.030
 you will need an android device 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:27.610
 running at least android 4 ice cream 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.130
 standing up straight is possible for 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.560
 sdr later can be run with 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.480
 previous versions of android but who 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.730
 will have to practice the device for 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.799
 use it rooting yours 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.049
 android device is not recommended a 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:41.530
 Unless you know what you are 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:44.230
 doing 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.260
 you will also need notes of go waves 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.269
 gav usb adapter for your 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:53.650
 android device to connect to the r 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:56.049
 DL 2.832 just any USB adapter 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.840
 it doesn't work because it doesn't have one 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:01.079
 slight cable wiring difference of 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.060
 using of course you will need 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:05.920
 the sdr trace application looks like that 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.470
 marin you're going to make a version 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.870
 sdr soccer demo available for 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.030
 allow to test software on the 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.560
 device to open all the 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.489
 features it looks like it will be 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:20.590
 need to buy a key of 9.99 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:22.900
 like in the crucial app have a version 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.180
 Software demo is a good idea 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.980
 since there is no such variety of 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.850
 android devices with professors 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.160
 different 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.840
 form factors and who should 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.570
 be able to test the software 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.060
 on your android device for 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:39.280
 see if it is up to the task 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.530
 also in this case if you have a 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.980
 fairly current android device 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:47.830
 with android 40 top you should 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.720
 be ready to go sdr blog 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:53.410

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:55.390
 adjust the rdl 2232 or through 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.580
 the use of a bar 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.040
 tuning or by issuing 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:04.030

 Displayed themes of the disc is the sanctum 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:14.370
 available full time in the version 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:17.110
 unlocked it is possible to optimize the rtl 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:19.510

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:21.430
 tuning by touching the display 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:26.230

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.250
 set mh zero to access the 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.290
 direct adjustment function for

 allow to manually set the 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:42.640
 attends central and also the button 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.200
 the disability some know 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:47.020
 features they can afford 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.850
 to use the heels on the old 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.200
 android device with a processor 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.750
 weaker 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:56.890
 our tests on the nexus 7 a system 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:59.350
 operating android 402 shown that sdr 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:02.620
 cacia worked quite well 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:05.650
 on the former on 7 everything was practically more 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.900
 gameplay right now sdr touch 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.820
 it's pretty simple but it's still 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.470
 pretty impressive 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.070
 a feature that needs 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.740
 quite quickly 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:17.600
 gain control function also 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.730
 if we had no problems with 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:24.830
 overload when using a cane 

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:26.630
 rtl 2.832 r800 20th could 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:29.390
 overloading front ends 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:30.920
 slick who lives near a door e 

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:33.860
 fm radio station 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:38.090
 we also found sdr trying with 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:41.960
 a rtl stick 2,832 urdu 120 ai 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:45.580
 dub hams with green while little sdr 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:48.740
 cw lsb basically worked 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:50.900
 usb decoding was not there we can 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.270
 receive abu trust signals with some 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:56.510
 of distortion quite well but 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:58.670
 USB and LSD band signals were not 

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:00.230
 easy to get clear and suffered 

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:02.390
 very low audio 

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:07.070
 at this point the settings of cw 

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:09.590
 apples fb usb and sp are marked 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:11.630
 with one in front of them indicated them 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:14.480
 they are still a work in progress 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:17.450
 in conclusion there is a great beginning 

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:20.210
 to provide a portable sdr solution 

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:24.320
 with an android device it's a stick 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:28.360
 rtl 2.832 this could be a lot 

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:28.360
 useful for signal discovery
