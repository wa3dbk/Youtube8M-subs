up<00:00:35.760> because<00:00:35.910> I'm<00:00:36.090> such<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.329> perfectionist<00:00:36.600> I

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
up because I'm such a perfectionist I

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.990 
up because I'm such a perfectionist I
think<00:00:37.800> I<00:00:37.920> should<00:00:38.100> always<00:00:38.370> save<00:00:38.610> it<00:00:38.760> no<00:00:38.850> matter

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
think I should always save it no matter

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.389 
think I should always save it no matter
what<00:00:39.149> if<00:00:40.110> even<00:00:40.649> if<00:00:40.770> they<00:00:40.890> even<00:00:41.010> if<00:00:41.219> it's<00:00:41.340> like

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
what if even if they even if it's like

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:42.830 
what if even if they even if it's like
the<00:00:41.520> most<00:00:41.579> impossible<00:00:41.940> girl<00:00:42.329> when<00:00:42.480> I<00:00:42.540> had<00:00:42.690> no

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
the most impossible girl when I had no

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.990 
the most impossible girl when I had no
chance<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.800> still<00:00:44.309> think<00:00:44.550> I<00:00:44.640> should<00:00:44.820> save<00:00:44.969> it

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
chance I still think I should save it

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.610 
chance I still think I should save it
it's<00:00:45.360> gospel<00:00:45.629> that's<00:00:45.960> what<00:00:46.110> I'm<00:00:46.200> like<00:00:46.379> I'm

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620

that I've let in a goal and just get on

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.620 
that I've let in a goal and just get on
with<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.439> game<00:01:04.470> so<00:01:05.369> dealing<00:01:06.000> with<00:01:06.240> crosses

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
with the game so dealing with crosses

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.600 
with the game so dealing with crosses
and<00:01:06.780> headers<00:01:07.470> so<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.890> best<00:01:08.010> thing<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.189> do<00:01:08.400> is

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
and headers so the best thing to do is

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.280 
and headers so the best thing to do is
literally<00:01:08.939> listen<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.510> your<00:01:09.659> circle<00:01:10.080> or

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
literally listen to your circle or

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.890 
literally listen to your circle or
waiver<00:01:10.650> should<00:01:11.010> be<00:01:11.100> positioned<00:01:11.840> try<00:01:12.840> to

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
waiver should be positioned try to

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.179 
waiver should be positioned try to
listen<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.619> that<00:01:13.710> as<00:01:13.830> much<00:01:14.010> as<00:01:14.040> possible

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
listen to that as much as possible

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.130 
listen to that as much as possible
because<00:01:14.640> with<00:01:14.850> crosses<00:01:15.299> that's<00:01:15.840> always<00:01:16.020> the

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
because with crosses that's always the

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.990 
because with crosses that's always the
best<00:01:16.409> thing<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.650> do<00:01:16.979> because<00:01:17.520> it<00:01:17.729> will<00:01:17.820> move

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
best thing to do because it will move

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.480 
best thing to do because it will move
you<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:19.170> best<00:01:19.439> position<00:01:19.619> depending<00:01:20.369> on

you to the best position depending on

you<00:01:23.009> don't<00:01:23.130> have<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.400> do<00:01:23.580> is<00:01:23.759> try<00:01:24.000> react<00:01:24.299> as

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
you don't have to do is try react as

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.880 
you don't have to do is try react as
quick<00:01:24.659> as<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:24.869> can<00:01:24.900> using<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.439> right<00:01:25.590> stick

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
quick as you can using the right stick

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.429 
quick as you can using the right stick
either<00:01:26.700> withholding<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.570> or<00:01:27.900> flicking<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.409> I

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
either withholding it or flicking it I

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.410 
either withholding it or flicking it I
personally<00:01:28.920> tend<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.189> hold<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:29.579> it's<00:01:30.270> what<00:01:30.390> I

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
personally tend to hold it it's what I

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.940 
personally tend to hold it it's what I
find<00:01:30.720> works<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.079> best<00:01:31.200> for<00:01:31.320> me<00:01:31.530> of<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.799> high

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
find works the best for me of a high

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.219 
find works the best for me of a high
percentage<00:01:32.159> of<00:01:32.460> saving<00:01:32.909> it<00:01:33.030> because<00:01:33.720> you<00:01:33.810> have

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
percentage of saving it because you have

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.749 
percentage of saving it because you have
to<00:01:34.320> worry<00:01:34.500> about<00:01:34.619> timing<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.220> save<00:01:35.430> you

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
to worry about timing the save you

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:36.980 
to worry about timing the save you
literally<00:01:36.000> just<00:01:36.270> have<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.479> hold<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:36.900> then

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
literally just have to hold it and then

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.749 
literally just have to hold it and then
they<00:01:37.200> will<00:01:37.320> do<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.590> saving<00:01:37.770> for<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:39.470> so<00:01:40.759> it's

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
they will do the saving for you so it's

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.100 
they will do the saving for you so it's
pretty<00:01:41.880> hard<00:01:42.150> if<00:01:42.270> they<00:01:42.390> get<00:01:42.570> header<00:01:42.780> off<00:01:42.960> in

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
pretty hard if they get header off in

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.469 
pretty hard if they get header off in
about<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.439> 5-yard<00:01:43.920> line<00:01:44.070> 6<00:01:44.399> yard<00:01:44.640> line<00:01:44.670> they

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
about the 5-yard line 6 yard line they

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.999 
about the 5-yard line 6 yard line they
will<00:01:45.750> score<00:01:46.020> it<00:01:46.110> no<00:01:46.320> matter<00:01:46.470> what<00:01:46.560> if<00:01:46.860> they've

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
will score it no matter what if they've

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.149 
will score it no matter what if they've
got<00:01:47.100> on<00:01:47.220> target<00:01:48.079> there's<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.140> very<00:01:49.409> very<00:01:49.950> small

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
got on target there's a very very small

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.530 
got on target there's a very very small
percentage<00:01:50.700> of<00:01:50.850> chance<00:01:51.210> that<00:01:51.420> you'll

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
percentage of chance that you'll

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.319 
percentage of chance that you'll
actually<00:01:51.570> clear<00:01:52.170> it<00:01:52.640> just<00:01:53.640> like<00:01:53.759> I<00:01:53.880> said<00:01:54.030> it's

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
actually clear it just like I said it's

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.490 
actually clear it just like I said it's
just<00:01:54.390> it's<00:01:54.689> just<00:01:54.720> not<00:01:55.020> it's<00:01:55.170> not<00:01:55.320> possible

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
just it's just not it's not possible

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.530 
just it's just not it's not possible
sometimes<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.369> you've<00:01:57.030> just<00:01:57.060> gotta<00:01:57.299> kind<00:01:57.509> of

have been asking to for me to try and

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.230 
have been asking to for me to try and
figure<00:02:01.649> out<00:02:01.770> something<00:02:02.340> that<00:02:02.579> you<00:02:02.850> guys<00:02:03.000> can

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
kind of do to stop headers but it's just

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.429 
kind of do to stop headers but it's just
something<00:02:06.450> that<00:02:06.479> you<00:02:06.630> can<00:02:06.750> have<00:02:06.840> to<00:02:06.960> be<00:02:07.110> lucky

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
something that you can have to be lucky

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.960 
something that you can have to be lucky
with<00:02:07.590> this<00:02:07.710> is<00:02:07.950> like<00:02:08.129> penalties<00:02:08.580> in<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:08.819> way

obviously penalties you like a 50-50
chance<00:02:11.250> of<00:02:11.640> scoring<00:02:11.910> where<00:02:12.270> we<00:02:12.360> even<00:02:12.540> like<00:02:12.629> a

chance of scoring where we even like a

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.820 
chance of scoring where we even like a
ninety<00:02:13.050> percent<00:02:13.140> chance

just give it your best shot I don't

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.590 
just give it your best shot I don't
always<00:02:28.830> save<00:02:29.130> head<00:02:29.310> is<00:02:29.430> like<00:02:29.610> I<00:02:29.730> said<00:02:29.970> even

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
always save head is like I said even

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.390 
always save head is like I said even
even<00:02:31.110> some<00:02:31.260> of<00:02:31.350> the<00:02:31.410> best<00:02:31.590> guys<00:02:31.770> on<00:02:31.920> FIFA

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
even some of the best guys on FIFA

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.040 
even some of the best guys on FIFA
probably<00:02:33.120> don't<00:02:33.300> save<00:02:33.540> head<00:02:33.720> as<00:02:33.810> you<00:02:33.930> could

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
probably don't save head as you could

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.180 
probably don't save head as you could
probably<00:02:34.110> ask<00:02:34.380> some<00:02:34.530> of<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.620> other<00:02:34.770> pro<00:02:34.920> clubs

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
probably ask some of the other pro clubs

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.940 
probably ask some of the other pro clubs
goalies<00:02:35.580> like<00:02:36.330> fusion<00:02:36.660> HD<00:02:37.170> or<00:02:37.410> Bruce<00:02:37.620> Lee<00:02:37.800> or

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
goalies like fusion HD or Bruce Lee or

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.100 
goalies like fusion HD or Bruce Lee or
something<00:02:38.250> underneath<00:02:38.460> guys<00:02:38.730> watch<00:02:38.940> them<00:02:39.180> but

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
something underneath guys watch them but

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.330 
something underneath guys watch them but
they're<00:02:40.230> two<00:02:40.410> of<00:02:40.440> the<00:02:40.560> other<00:02:40.770> goalies<00:02:41.160> that

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
they're two of the other goalies that

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.710 
they're two of the other goalies that
I'd<00:02:41.430> recommend<00:02:41.760> watching<00:02:42.030> on<00:02:42.300> YouTube<00:02:42.600> is

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
I'd recommend watching on YouTube is

I'd recommend watching on YouTube is
well<00:02:43.280> obviously<00:02:44.280> I<00:02:44.430> shouldn't<00:02:44.760> always<00:02:44.940> say

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
well obviously I shouldn't always say

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.520 
well obviously I shouldn't always say
that<00:02:45.510> because<00:02:45.660> obviously<00:02:45.900> I'm<00:02:46.140> a<00:02:46.200> goalie<00:02:46.410> as

you can't do that then I'd recommend
trying<00:03:27.000> to<00:03:27.120> practice<00:03:27.269> that<00:03:28.010> because<00:03:29.010> it<00:03:29.730> saves

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
trying to practice that because it saves

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:31.699 
trying to practice that because it saves
the<00:03:30.510> chance<00:03:30.750> of<00:03:30.959> them<00:03:31.080> getting<00:03:31.110> ahead<00:03:31.440> away

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
the chance of them getting ahead away

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.380 
the chance of them getting ahead away
well<00:03:31.890> just<00:03:32.010> once<00:03:32.160> they<00:03:32.250> get<00:03:32.340> ahead<00:03:32.519> away<00:03:32.790> like

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
well just once they get ahead away like

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:34.790 
well just once they get ahead away like
I<00:03:33.420> said<00:03:33.600> I<00:03:33.660> pretty<00:03:33.870> much<00:03:33.930> scoring<00:03:34.410> but<00:03:34.620> if<00:03:34.739> you

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
I said I pretty much scoring but if you

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.410 
I said I pretty much scoring but if you
come<00:03:34.920> out<00:03:35.070> and<00:03:35.130> catch<00:03:35.310> your<00:03:35.459> punch<00:03:35.730> it<00:03:35.970> then

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
come out and catch your punch it then

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:37.729 
come out and catch your punch it then
they<00:03:36.510> won't<00:03:36.630> do<00:03:36.810> so<00:03:37.050> that's<00:03:37.320> pretty<00:03:37.440> the<00:03:37.590> best

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
they won't do so that's pretty the best
