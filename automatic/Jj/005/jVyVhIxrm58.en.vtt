00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
would do with the Mass Effect universe

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.750 
would do with the Mass Effect universe
and<00:00:28.019> how<00:00:28.109> they<00:00:28.289> would<00:00:28.439> you<00:00:28.769> know<00:00:28.920> it's<00:00:29.550> still

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
and how they would you know it's still

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.550 
and how they would you know it's still
very<00:00:29.910> recognizable<00:00:30.599> e<00:00:30.630> mass<00:00:30.810> spec<00:00:31.080> you<00:00:31.260> you

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
very recognizable e mass spec you you

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.290 
very recognizable e mass spec you you
see<00:00:31.800> it<00:00:31.890> he's<00:00:32.099> like<00:00:32.340> yep<00:00:32.550> that's<00:00:32.820> mass<00:00:33.059> spec

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
see it he's like yep that's mass spec

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.700 
see it he's like yep that's mass spec
but<00:00:33.450> it<00:00:33.600> they've<00:00:33.750> all<00:00:33.870> got<00:00:34.110> their<00:00:34.230> own<00:00:34.260> take<00:00:34.590> on

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
but it they've all got their own take on

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.170 
but it they've all got their own take on
it<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.980> cover<00:00:35.219> artists<00:00:35.640> do<00:00:35.730> things<00:00:36.000> slightly

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
differently than Omar Francia who does

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.200

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
or he too has his own take on it and

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.950 
or he too has his own take on it and
it's<00:00:44.579> still<00:00:44.850> clearly<00:00:45.120> Mass<00:00:45.420> Effect<00:00:45.750> but<00:00:45.930> I

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
it's still clearly Mass Effect but I

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.229 
it's still clearly Mass Effect but I
just<00:00:46.170> love<00:00:46.410> looking<00:00:46.620> at<00:00:46.860> it<00:00:47.010> so<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.789> me<00:00:47.940> yeah

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.420 
I'm blown away every time I see it with
that<00:00:52.320> big<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.710> universe<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.280> play

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
that big of a universe to play

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.950 
that big of a universe to play
story-wise<00:00:53.879> did<00:00:54.149> you<00:00:54.239> find<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:54.539> hard<00:00:54.660> not<00:00:54.750> to

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
story-wise did you find it hard not to

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.049 
story-wise did you find it hard not to
go<00:00:55.110> as<00:00:55.350> big<00:00:55.770> in<00:00:56.010> comic<00:00:56.430> books<00:00:56.610> as<00:00:56.760> you<00:00:56.879> were<00:00:56.969> in

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
the game yeah I think that's that was

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.979 
the game yeah I think that's that was
one<00:00:59.789> of<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.940> things<00:01:00.030> I<00:01:00.210> learned<00:01:00.390> early<00:01:00.660> on

one of the things I learned early on

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.930 
one of the things I learned early on

to<00:01:10.500> have<00:01:10.710> one<00:01:10.890> action<00:01:11.130> per<00:01:11.400> panel<00:01:12.350> try<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.409> have

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
to have one action per panel try to have

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.469

one idea per page and I think that's

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.270 
one idea per page and I think that's
obviously<00:01:16.080> where<00:01:16.259> I<00:01:16.320> probably<00:01:16.860> fell<00:01:17.040> down<00:01:17.250> a

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
obviously where I probably fell down a

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.310 
obviously where I probably fell down a
lot<00:01:17.520> in<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.759> first<00:01:17.909> first<00:01:18.450> my<00:01:18.630> first<00:01:18.840> round<00:01:19.049> I

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
lot in the first first my first round I

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.380 
lot in the first first my first round I
was<00:01:20.070> trying<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.430> do<00:01:20.520> too<00:01:20.729> much<00:01:20.880> in<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:21.150> lot<00:01:21.299> of

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
was trying to do too much in a lot of

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.870 
was trying to do too much in a lot of
cases<00:01:21.890> one<00:01:22.890> of<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.040> things<00:01:23.250> I<00:01:23.369> really<00:01:23.700> enjoy

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
cases one of the things I really enjoy

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.030 
cases one of the things I really enjoy
doing<00:01:23.909> is<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.600> little<00:01:25.110> eight-page<00:01:25.290> comics<00:01:25.979> I

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
doing is the little eight-page comics I

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.760 
doing is the little eight-page comics I
did<00:01:26.189> as<00:01:26.310> well<00:01:26.340> because<00:01:26.820> then<00:01:26.970> not<00:01:27.600> only<00:01:27.930> is<00:01:28.710> it

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
did as well because then not only is it

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.980 
did as well because then not only is it
comics<00:01:29.400> but<00:01:29.579> you<00:01:29.700> have<00:01:29.820> only<00:01:30.030> eight<00:01:30.329> pages<00:01:30.659> to

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
comics but you have only eight pages to

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.929
