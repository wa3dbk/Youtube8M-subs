we're<00:04:51.030> working<00:04:51.360> with<00:04:51.540> the<00:04:51.800> 740<00:04:52.800> and<00:04:53.150> it<00:04:54.150> does

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
we're working with the 740 and it does

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.020 
we're working with the 740 and it does
not<00:04:54.710> cook<00:04:55.710> to<00:04:55.919> any<00:04:56.070> meter<00:04:56.340> it's<00:04:56.610> going<00:04:56.760> to<00:04:56.850> go

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
not cook to any meter it's going to go

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:02.740 
not cook to any meter it's going to go
by<00:04:57.210> days<00:04:58.070> so<00:04:59.070> anyway<00:04:59.580> the<00:04:59.760> circuit<00:05:00.180> board

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750

connector<00:05:04.130> locks<00:05:05.130> in<00:05:05.810> and<00:05:06.860> then<00:05:08.510> there's<00:05:09.510> like

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750 
connector locks in and then there's like

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.480 
connector locks in and then there's like
a<00:05:09.780> little<00:05:11.780> little<00:05:12.780> shelf<00:05:13.140> right<00:05:13.440> here<00:05:13.950> on<00:05:14.160> the

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
a little little shelf right here on the

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
circuit board just kind of set that

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.230 
circuit board just kind of set that
right<00:05:17.790> there<00:05:17.850> and<00:05:18.480> then<00:05:19.380> rock<00:05:20.190> it<00:05:20.460> forward<00:05:20.790> and

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
right there and then rock it forward and

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.750 
right there and then rock it forward and
it<00:05:21.900> snaps<00:05:22.200> into<00:05:22.470> place<00:05:22.710> and<00:05:23.160> if<00:05:23.340> you<00:05:23.460> needed<00:05:23.669> to

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:23.760 
it snaps into place and if you needed to

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.110 
it snaps into place and if you needed to
release<00:05:24.150> it<00:05:24.450> it's<00:05:25.200> right<00:05:25.470> here<00:05:25.980> that<00:05:26.790> way<00:05:26.940> you

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 
release it it's right here that way you

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:33.110 
release it it's right here that way you
can<00:05:28.730> make<00:05:29.730> sure<00:05:29.760> cables<00:05:30.540> attached<00:05:30.900> and<00:05:32.120> you
