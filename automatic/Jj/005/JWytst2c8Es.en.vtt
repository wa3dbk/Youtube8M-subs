00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
quickly and fairly well so as long as

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.700 
quickly and fairly well so as long as
it's<00:01:30.150> within<00:01:30.360> our<00:01:30.570> radius<00:01:30.930> of<00:01:31.079> you<00:01:31.170> or<00:01:31.380> we<00:01:31.560> can

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
it's within our radius of you or we can

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.569 
it's within our radius of you or we can
slide<00:01:32.100> it's<00:01:32.909> a<00:01:32.970> pan<00:01:33.210> left<00:01:33.509> pan<00:01:34.020> right<00:01:34.340> pan<00:01:35.340> up

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
slide it's a pan left pan right pan up

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.450 
slide it's a pan left pan right pan up
tilt<00:01:36.060> up<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.479> tilt<00:01:36.630> down<00:01:37.220> things<00:01:38.220> like<00:01:38.430> that

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
tilt up and tilt down things like that

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.289 
tilt up and tilt down things like that
so<00:01:39.299> this<00:01:39.420> is<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.630> really<00:01:40.320> neat<00:01:40.759> feature<00:01:41.759> with
