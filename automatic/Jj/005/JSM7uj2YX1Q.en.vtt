00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:05.104
When I was 14 years old I saw 'Ubu aux Bouffes'

00:00:05.284 --> 00:00:07.414
directed by Peter Brook,

00:00:07.954 --> 00:00:16.951
and the joy I received was so immense, that I said, "I want to give this back".

00:00:20.981 --> 00:00:25.671
Art is making the link of a reality.

00:00:26.451 --> 00:00:32.181
What we can see, what we can touch, what we can smell,

00:00:32.181 --> 00:00:37.141
into another invisible reality.

00:00:37.141 --> 00:00:41.751
I think it's the link between the real and the invisible.

00:00:42.093 --> 00:00:46.513
For me the best art is when the body and the spirit are one.

00:00:46.706 --> 00:00:51.946
Usually it's all separated, because we have been separating things for a very long time.

00:00:51.946 --> 00:00:57.066
There's been seperation between the spirit and the body - the body being bad,

00:00:57.066 --> 00:01:02.916
the body being crude, being filthy somehow

00:01:02.916 --> 00:01:05.946
and the spirit being the good thing.

00:01:05.946 --> 00:01:10.986
I think we have to stop this misunderstanding,

00:01:12.456 --> 00:01:14.906
"There has been a big mistake there!"

00:01:15.223 --> 00:01:18.743
We have to link it back and that's what actors do and artists do,

00:01:18.903 --> 00:01:21.675
because without body there's no art

00:01:21.675 --> 00:01:23.943
and without spirit there is no art.

00:01:23.943 --> 00:01:25.603
So we have to link it.

00:01:25.723 --> 00:01:33.883
That's why dance when its full of spirit, with life inside then it is so powerful.

00:01:34.573 --> 00:01:36.963
Art is there to transform us.

00:01:36.963 --> 00:01:41.533
It is a medium to transform, to be able to see things in a different way,

00:01:41.533 --> 00:01:43.723
to feel things in a different way,

00:01:43.723 --> 00:01:48.513
to be in a place inside of us that we have never thought about, or never felt before.

00:01:48.513 --> 00:01:52.513
It's something to discover, its the love of the new.

00:01:53.651 --> 00:01:56.431
Why are you touched by this more than that?

00:01:56.431 --> 00:02:03.601
For me it's when the art is made from somebody who is truthful to himself, to herself.

00:02:05.428 --> 00:02:12.168
Of course it requires work, it requires a certain, I would say intelligence,

00:02:12.168 --> 00:02:17.478
but not in the intellectual way. It's just in the perceiving sense.

00:02:17.478 --> 00:02:21.478
The intelligence of the body,

00:02:21.478 --> 00:02:28.868
of understanding through your heart and of course your mind, but it has to be linked.

00:02:29.368 --> 00:02:32.808
In the theatre because I've done seven plays,

00:02:32.808 --> 00:02:34.638
so not that many,

00:02:34.638 --> 00:02:39.448
even though it was really what I wanted to do to start with.

00:02:39.448 --> 00:02:45.008
It was my dream and my love and, yeah, my inspiration.

00:02:45.082 --> 00:02:47.532
It's true that once I said,

00:02:47.532 --> 00:02:54.862
"It's like having a thousand camera's pointing at you when you are on stage, instead of one",

00:02:55.191 --> 00:02:59.591
which isn't true in a way, but at the same time you take it as a whole.

00:02:59.961 --> 00:03:01.873
It's one big presence

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.940
and you have to believe that it comes from a good willed place.

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:15.619
If you start to be paranoid as actors, as we tend to be because we are so exposed,

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:22.599
so we try to protect ourselves somehow, in thinking, "is he liking me or is he not liking me?"

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:28.149
So you have to come from a place where you think that there is no judgement,

00:03:28.671 --> 00:03:32.671
its just being together and going through a journey together.

00:03:33.101 --> 00:03:37.831
But you need a lot of work on yourself to start from there!

00:03:38.277 --> 00:03:43.517
You have to go imagine that it's possible, this renunion,

00:03:43.727 --> 00:03:47.727
because we're just serving a story, we're just there

00:03:49.058 --> 00:03:51.808
to share something mysterious.

00:03:54.352 --> 00:03:57.252
There is something about creating in the moment,

00:03:57.252 --> 00:04:03.012
that's why theatre is so magical because you create this moment together.

00:04:03.824 --> 00:04:11.414
It will go forever, but it will stay forever and that's the eternity in something so ephemeral.

00:04:13.562 --> 00:04:17.452
So it's this combination that I find fascinating,

00:04:17.688 --> 00:04:19.818
that's why I always miss it.

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.979
In films there is that as well when you are shooting, but there is a medium in between, which is the film.

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:32.840
So you don't get the information as close or as direct as a spectator in the theatre.

00:04:33.657 --> 00:04:37.657
You have no medium you are just seeing what's happening, it's just your eyes.

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.850
So the magic can be so forever,

00:04:44.515 --> 00:04:48.515
you can be taken forever,

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:52.223
hurt or touched forever.
