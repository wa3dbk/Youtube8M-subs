 the infight urgently needs hotkeys 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.000
 since you clicker you will 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.690
 logically much less hps 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.610

 much more time to use 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:39.530
 secondly, mouseover macros uses obama 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.299
 Big could either write himself 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.460
 then look in the description is about

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.049
 from the schami post 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.970
 you drive easily with the mouse on the 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.090
 unit frame or over the 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:57.600

 press the hotkey additional need me 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:06.600
 Selecting a goal is very important, it saves you money 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.209
 one click and much more time 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.700
 especially if you have to cross out 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:13.349
 Of course, there are also addons that 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.120
 whole mouseover written for you 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:19.950

 written or voodoo 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.580
 Of course, the best known could also be 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.099
 use 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.530
 personally, I stand on it myself 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:30.180
 which one was to be written markus 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.420
 Although relatively fast the battery list full 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.970
 but works fine 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.620
 point number three in eclipse look that 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.950

 lotz each lost 10 are there 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:02.400
 100 are extrapolated at 25 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:05.280
 Join then 2500 primary instead of the 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.829
 So flute is not really 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.900
 you should definitely be so plump 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:12.180
 always new clip on the current and 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:16.319

 a schematic of the primary city rain rui 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.139
 just forge something will or quitt 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:35.100
 was to improve some marek 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:37.290
 otherwise class on your best 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.420
 secondary rather than what in most cases 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.060
 tempowertung would be 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:45.060
 point number four is knowledge 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:47.850
 you Proske or offer to encounter the 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.799
 knowledges about her just know 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.359
 Much earlier when the damage occurs 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:54.230
 the group or the tanks 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:57.389

 purely non comes to three and a half seconds 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.090
 groups box 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.459
 is simply much more effective than 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.930
 if the damage is already there and you 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:12.550
 then it starts with carstensen 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.440

 maybe even a few 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.229
 upset 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:26.710
 point number five interface and 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:28.120
 Survey arrange best new 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.760

 in the middle everything all the information he 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:36.669
 needs for example in the cast bar for 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:40.450
 example unit frame that you constantly 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:42.940
 city ​​for the hot keys in the optimal case 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:45.400
 also show for 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:49.479
 important cooldown for example one 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:52.120
 flood or stimulate and of course the ride 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:54.820
 inter fans you have the ride interface 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:58.389
 right and in the corner unit frame left 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:59.830
 the top are loud kiess in the middle 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:01.780

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:08.440
 to hike, during which suits you 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:10.120
 just like in the gold zone and notice it 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:14.380
 probably does not exist or to 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:15.630
 actually 12,000 hps 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:18.800
 not necessary 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:22.370
 point number six match 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.930
 the whole as a sporty one 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:26.270
 It's nice to have a match with him 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.940
 or should that be a cut 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:31.879
 at least not so ambitious if 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:33.500
 it in personal rice or stem 

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:37.039
 You've been riding for seven years 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:39.050
 rated it still looks like a match 

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:41.800
 because so you can constantly 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:45.800
 you only have to improve on the best 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:48.229

 leads to success and that also constantly 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:06:00.020
 because you can also improve without 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:03.280
 for example, the fifth part of the one 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:06.020
 Gift no human needs to receive 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:08.770
