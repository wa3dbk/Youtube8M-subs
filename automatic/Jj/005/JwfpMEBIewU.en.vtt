which I then draw on to the silk it
soaks<00:01:16.950> into<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.550> fiber<00:01:17.940> and<00:01:18.770> sets<00:01:19.770> hard<00:01:20.130> and

soaks into the fiber and sets hard and
this<00:01:21.240> acts<00:01:21.570> as<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:21.990> barrier<00:01:22.380> for<00:01:23.220> when<00:01:23.369> I<00:01:23.400> paint
