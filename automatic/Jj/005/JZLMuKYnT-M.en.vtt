00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 Step 1: All hair to collect in the tail in the center of the head. Separate the thin strand from the tail and close the gum with it. 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 Step 2: Divide the hair of the tail into two strands. 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 Step 3: Start weaving a spikelet. On the left side to separate the thin strand, stretch it over the entire left strand and connect with the right. 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 Step 4: On the right side, separate the thin strand, stretch it over the entire right strand and connect it to the left. Run three such weaves 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 Step 5: On the left side, separate the thin strand, stretch it under the entire left strand and connect it with the right one. 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 Step 6: On the right side, separate the thin strand, stretch it under the entire right strand and connect it to the left. Run three such weaves and turn the braid over. 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 Step 7: Re-execute three weaves on the outer side of the braid and turn the braid over. 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 Step 8: Execute three weaves from the inside and turn the braid over again. 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 Step 9: Thus do weave the braid to the end. 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 Step 10: Secure the ends of the braids with a rubber band.
