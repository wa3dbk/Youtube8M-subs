watching this video because i'm using
the<00:00:17.580> same<00:00:17.820> trick<00:00:18.090> here<00:00:18.359> and<00:00:18.630> i<00:00:19.080> won't<00:00:19.410> show<00:00:19.590> it

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
the same trick here and i won't show it

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.950 
the same trick here and i won't show it
again<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.189> you<00:00:21.119> might<00:00:21.300> not<00:00:21.449> understand

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
again and you might not understand

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.950 
again and you might not understand
what's<00:00:22.140> happening<00:00:22.470> so<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.820> setup<00:00:24.240> here<00:00:24.689> is

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
what's happening so the setup here is

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.060 
what's happening so the setup here is
like<00:00:25.619> so<00:00:26.029> here<00:00:27.029> i<00:00:27.240> have<00:00:27.359> a<00:00:27.840> water<00:00:28.170> spring<00:00:28.619> and

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
like so here i have a water spring and

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.560 
like so here i have a water spring and
water<00:00:29.250> block<00:00:29.990> down<00:00:30.990> below<00:00:31.500> here<00:00:31.949> i<00:00:32.329> have<00:00:33.329> a

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
water block down below here i have a

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.090 
water block down below here i have a
deployer<00:00:34.110> with<00:00:34.940> volcanic<00:00:35.940> amulet<00:00:36.829> above<00:00:37.829> here

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
deployer with volcanic amulet above here

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.680 
deployer with volcanic amulet above here
Ivan<00:00:38.550> breaker<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:40.640> the<00:00:41.640> breaker<00:00:42.059> is<00:00:42.270> facing

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
Ivan breaker and the breaker is facing

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.139 
Ivan breaker and the breaker is facing
down<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:42.960> deployer<00:00:43.530> is<00:00:43.649> facing<00:00:44.129> up<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.579> right

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
down the deployer is facing up and right

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.529 
down the deployer is facing up and right
here<00:00:45.180> I'm<00:00:45.629> having<00:00:45.989> I<00:00:46.230> have<00:00:46.530> piston<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.300> all<00:00:48.300> of

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
here I'm having I have piston and all of

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.930 
here I'm having I have piston and all of
them<00:00:48.750> are<00:00:48.989> connected<00:00:49.710> with<00:00:50.430> all<00:00:50.610> them

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
them are connected with all them

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.529 
them are connected with all them
together<00:00:51.239> connected<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.260> time<00:00:52.500> set<00:00:53.010> to

00:00:53.529 --> 00:00:53.539 
together connected to the time set to

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:57.860 
together connected to the time set to
0.2<00:00:54.539> seconds<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:56.210> what's<00:00:57.210> going<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.510> happen

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
0.2 seconds and what's going to happen

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.430 
0.2 seconds and what's going to happen
when<00:00:58.020> turning<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.410> on<00:00:58.530> is<00:00:59.570> I'm<00:01:00.570> going<00:01:01.170> to

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
when turning it on is I'm going to

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.429 
when turning it on is I'm going to
basically<00:01:02.539> looks<00:01:03.539> it<00:01:03.629> is<00:01:03.780> being<00:01:03.960> spammed

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
basically looks it is being spammed

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.010 
basically looks it is being spammed
because<00:01:05.280> of<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.519> water<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.600> breakers

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
because of the water and the breakers

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.899 
because of the water and the breakers
could<00:01:07.260> be<00:01:07.350> really<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:08.070> what<00:01:08.340> happens<00:01:08.700> then

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
could be really and what happens then

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.149 
could be really and what happens then
Binnington<00:01:09.689> but<00:01:10.020> as<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.260> can<00:01:10.439> see<00:01:10.710> i'm<00:01:10.920> also

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
Binnington but as you can see i'm also

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.060 
Binnington but as you can see i'm also
losing<00:01:11.880> redstone<00:01:12.740> because<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.860> way<00:01:13.950> of

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
losing redstone because the way of

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.999 
losing redstone because the way of
walking<00:01:14.189> it<00:01:14.460> amulet<00:01:15.390> works<00:01:15.570> you<00:01:16.500> generates

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
walking it amulet works you generates

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.880 
walking it amulet works you generates
one<00:01:17.310> block<00:01:17.549> of<00:01:17.700> lava<00:01:17.909> in<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.780> cost<00:01:19.350> of<00:01:19.619> two

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
one block of lava in the cost of two

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.140 
one block of lava in the cost of two
redstone<00:01:20.130> dust<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:22.369> using<00:01:23.369> that<00:01:23.640> in<00:01:24.030> a

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
redstone dust and using that in a

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.550 
redstone dust and using that in a
deployed<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.960> create<00:01:25.350> obsidian<00:01:25.920> and

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
deployed to create obsidian and

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.760 
deployed to create obsidian and
basically<00:01:29.210> then<00:01:30.210> uses<00:01:30.540> redstone<00:01:31.049> now<00:01:31.710> the

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
basically then uses redstone now the

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.620 
basically then uses redstone now the
solution<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.340> that<00:01:32.610> is<00:01:32.880> that<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.390> share<00:01:33.600> a

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
solution to that is that you share a

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.539 
solution to that is that you share a
high<00:01:33.840> level<00:01:34.170> in<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.320> game<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:34.890> most<00:01:35.100> likely

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
high level in the game you most likely

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.880 
high level in the game you most likely
can<00:01:35.909> have<00:01:36.060> access<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.540> it<00:01:36.659> line<00:01:36.869> stop<00:01:37.200> right

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
can have access to it line stop right

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.760 
can have access to it line stop right
now<00:01:38.100> i'm<00:01:38.220> using<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.850> TMI<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.900> hakone<00:01:40.439> into<00:01:40.680> the

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
now i'm using the TMI to hakone into the

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.580 
now i'm using the TMI to hakone into the
game<00:01:41.009> but<00:01:41.360> it's<00:01:42.360> quite<00:01:42.750> simple<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.200> get<00:01:43.439> it

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
game but it's quite simple to get it

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.499 
game but it's quite simple to get it
once<00:01:43.829> you're<00:01:44.009> high<00:01:44.159> level<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.670> what<00:01:45.149> client

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
once you're high level and what client

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.649 
once you're high level and what client
star<00:01:45.750> doesn't<00:01:46.049> if<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:46.350> don't<00:01:46.560> exchange<00:01:46.829> is

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
star doesn't if you don't exchange is

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:50.660 
star doesn't if you don't exchange is
every<00:01:48.659> item<00:01:48.810> that<00:01:48.990> requires<00:01:49.770> redstone<00:01:50.490> dust

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
every item that requires redstone dust

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.730 
every item that requires redstone dust
comes<00:01:51.180> free<00:01:51.450> of<00:01:51.540> charge<00:01:51.869> when<00:01:52.380> you<00:01:52.500> have<00:01:52.619> that

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
comes free of charge when you have that

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.920 
comes free of charge when you have that
item<00:01:53.159> in<00:01:53.340> your<00:01:53.430> inventory<00:01:54.350> using<00:01:55.460> an<00:01:56.930> brawl

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
item in your inventory using an brawl

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.020 
item in your inventory using an brawl
can't<00:01:58.140> emulate<00:01:58.380> won't<00:01:58.920> use<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.219> redstone<00:01:59.670> and

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
can't emulate won't use a redstone and

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.980 
can't emulate won't use a redstone and
then<00:02:00.810> it<00:02:01.140> becomes<00:02:01.619> basically<00:02:01.890> free<00:02:02.689> also<00:02:03.689> what

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
then it becomes basically free also what

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.719 
then it becomes basically free also what
you<00:02:04.020> can<00:02:04.259> see<00:02:04.590> a<00:02:04.619> bug<00:02:04.829> in<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.280> system<00:02:05.460> that

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
you can see a bug in the system that

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.120 
you can see a bug in the system that
sometimes

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
sometimes

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.790 
sometimes
the<00:02:08.060> love<00:02:08.239> spreads<00:02:08.750> before<00:02:09.170> the<00:02:09.289> water<00:02:09.410> and

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
the love spreads before the water and

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.479 
the love spreads before the water and
generates<00:02:10.369> a<00:02:11.200> couple<00:02:12.200> of<00:02:12.470> methods<00:02:12.830> reeling
