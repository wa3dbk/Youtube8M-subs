00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:10.510
 The aim of 3 consecutive wins is a match in Nagasaki that we want to stop the consecutive losses in 3 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:19.450
 First 3 minutes 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:23.560
 Morimoto runs on the front line where the ground number first created a chance from this long ball 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:27.450
 It was a ball , but if you put the ball here and make the time, the players in the second row will be written 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.450
 It is co-player who was empty treatment 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:33.080
 But then I played for 27 minutes in front of Chiba, which had been dragged a bit into Nagasaki's base 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:38.000
 You can see 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:42.410
 Do not put a number of people to still 5 ball side and touched a long does it people one recoil is now cold 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.910
 An attempt was made to go with it because it is fast and Uyonjaga poison force in evolution this is a little 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.790
 When the angle was shallow, the last time the Yamaguchi player played well , it was 0 vs 0 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.740
 3 minutes in the second half 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:54.290
 Chiba Noe Station 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:58.260
 This was very fast from second ball Hanno city, but it is Yamanaka no Tori Blue 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:01:01.920
 Suu Mane Left foot I think really attractive player 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.850
 Rice is enough Nagasaki left side 4 j 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.890
 You first trick 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:10.230
 And Kanzaki city came to support 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.400
 It is old to send a cross before the goal 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.400
 I would like to say rather 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.480
 It is pulling standing by to launch the ion 10 players first Nee 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:27.820
 The players of little Ne Chiba players and medium it was oh well laws and regulations to the ball watcher 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:31.620
 Become 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:35.970
 Well the ball was good though 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.570
 In addition, we suffered from pace of Nagasaki and could not attack Chiba 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:43.400
 Beyond 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:45.900
 It's Yamada's or grander's side, and it's not for me . 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:49.290
 First touch is everything, is n't it? 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.210
 It pulled pretend without hesitation to the course at this moment 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.540
 It seems a little non-rotation 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:02:00.110
 It was a 2 p ball by bouncing in front of the keeper 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:00.110
 This is a great goal was Chiba large once caught up soon 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:11.760
 And it is the latter half 30 minutes Nagasaki is again in high position here, but the point takes a goal 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:16.350
 Hey before without it it was faster ball falls 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:22.870
 As we know that this Yamaguchi player firmly and shoots what we can not forget 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:25.130
 It was n't initially at all, but if you leave it in the middle of Nagasaki and the Middle East for another 36 minutes 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:30.700
 This it But I was a scan N train 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:32.090
 If it makes an image, it winds with the right foot and is on the left side of the keeper mother player 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.090
 I think so 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.959
 It is an attack of Chiba in the last 40 minutes 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.959
 Incense burner buyers 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:49.390
 After starting with the 8th, I said it was one step after the other 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:49.390
 This card is now a game that must not be finalized and ended in a one-on-one draw
