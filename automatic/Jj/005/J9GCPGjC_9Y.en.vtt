00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:06.930
 selena I'm just starting so I hope 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.160
 that you will enjoy my video I will 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.260
 to show you how we do that they have 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.389
 the numbers are just about a year 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.480
 so for the possible what you need 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:19.500
 so I do a little care first 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:22.109
 after it needs a mourning topcoat that 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.720
 last six links the color and the 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:29.099
 solvent to clean them then is 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:32.820
 also the pen for admitted then everything 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.050
 first I clean house because if 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.000
 it's not very clean but there it is not 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.059
 top and it's always better when it's 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:44.879
 clean so especially that I do with a 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:50.250
 transparent basis so it's better after 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:51.719
 that it is cleaned I do the care I 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.850
 do not know anymore I loose tmc per se 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.539
 manicure it can be done with 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.280
 olive oil 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.260
 normally we just know that for the 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.680
 cuticles to which are moisturize and not 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.520
 that it makes the crowds nail board 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.520
 a little wrinkled re-read 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:19.180
 after I pass the friends that hardens on 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.280
 the nails for him so I have a little 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:27.070
 breaking callongs disturb ben it's 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:28.420
 poor who lasts and that will also be my 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.030
 color 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.290
 I put it twice because it's 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.810
 like all my friends are masters of strong 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.330
 and you will put your color if you 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.470
 want the same color to end 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.470
 I think it's better without modesty 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:48.430
 now that I have gone well I want 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.710
 pass in the pen my friends it's a 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.090
 support to the families I bought in 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.820
 Spain is successful but there are some 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.470
 to clear to meyrin moussa not sure if 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.050
 eventually we could even go 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.600
 at the blue dragonfly then at 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:04.540
 species of the triangle and I've been moving a 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:18.250
 little on the sides for it to make a 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:20.650
 little more and his tigers actually have to 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.190
 pass twice on the triulzi peaks that 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.190
 not walk there 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:35.609
 after it's over I'll go 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:37.370
 the top coat to protect the last and 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:40.260
 why can it last longer 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.150
 and that also fades that shine and that 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.239
 it happens at the same height of the 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.159
 polish then when we touch long done 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:49.730
 that it is I pass the top coat two 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:54.569
 time for it to be really more 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:03:00.629
 protectors but that's the result 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:01.470
 so you like it but made paper 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:04.489
 simple and efficient 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.489
 goodbye
