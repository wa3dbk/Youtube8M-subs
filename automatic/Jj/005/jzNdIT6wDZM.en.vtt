bring up the board and show you how
things<00:01:32.009> are<00:01:32.159> moving<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.430> grooving<00:01:32.670> across

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
things are moving and grooving across

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:33.499 
things are moving and grooving across
the<00:01:33.090> country

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
the country

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:34.730 
the country
as<00:01:33.689> you<00:01:33.840> can<00:01:33.930> see<00:01:34.110> delays<00:01:34.409> aren't<00:01:34.650> an<00:01:34.710> issue

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
as you can see delays aren't an issue

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.230 
as you can see delays aren't an issue
for<00:01:35.040> us<00:01:35.100> so<00:01:35.220> let's<00:01:35.369> go<00:01:35.490> straight<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.000> board

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
for us so let's go straight to the board

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.940 
for us so let's go straight to the board
and<00:01:36.479> so<00:01:36.780> we've<00:01:36.960> got<00:01:37.079> cancellation<00:01:37.829> wise

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
and so we've got cancellation wise

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.190 
and so we've got cancellation wise
because<00:01:38.280> we<00:01:38.369> have<00:01:38.460> over<00:01:38.640> six<00:01:39.000> hundred

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
because we have over six hundred

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.090 
because we have over six hundred
cancellations<00:01:40.200> if<00:01:40.320> we<00:01:40.380> go<00:01:40.500> straight<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:41.009> the

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
cancellations if we go straight to the

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.679 
cancellations if we go straight to the
board<00:01:41.310> I<00:01:41.430> can<00:01:41.549> show<00:01:41.700> you<00:01:41.790> that<00:01:41.939> there's<00:01:42.570> what

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
board I can show you that there's what

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.270 
board I can show you that there's what
we're<00:01:42.780> looking<00:01:42.990> at<00:01:43.049> six<00:01:43.350> hundred<00:01:43.649> thirty<00:01:43.920> six

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
we're looking at six hundred thirty six

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.480 
we're looking at six hundred thirty six
cancellations<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:46.040> 156<00:01:47.040> of<00:01:47.130> those<00:01:47.250> are<00:01:47.399> in

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
cancellations and 156 of those are in

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.289 
cancellations and 156 of those are in
Boston<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.270> we've<00:01:48.390> got<00:01:48.619> 102<00:01:49.619> at<00:01:50.070> JFK<00:01:50.909> as<00:01:51.060> well

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
Boston and we've got 102 at JFK as well

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.149 
Boston and we've got 102 at JFK as well
so<00:01:51.659> those<00:01:52.020> cancellations<00:01:52.439> still<00:01:52.829> in<00:01:52.950> place

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
so those cancellations still in place

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.770 
so those cancellations still in place
but<00:01:53.490> at<00:01:53.579> least<00:01:53.790> it's<00:01:54.030> not<00:01:54.119> as<00:01:54.270> widespread<00:01:54.479> as

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
but at least it's not as widespread as

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.630 
but at least it's not as widespread as
we<00:01:54.960> were<00:01:55.140> yesterday<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.490> day<00:01:56.520> before

we were yesterday and the day before

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.120 
we were yesterday and the day before

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
Maria we've got an improving condition

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.350 
Maria we've got an improving condition

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
as far as snowfall goes but that might

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.240
