24 hours

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:46.849 
24 hours
they<00:01:43.829> usually<00:01:44.569> naturally<00:01:45.569> disperse<00:01:46.499> the<00:01:46.709> egg

00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:46.859 
they usually naturally disperse the egg

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:48.919 
they usually naturally disperse the egg
on<00:01:47.009> their<00:01:47.159> own<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.639> I<00:01:48.119> can<00:01:48.270> get<00:01:48.389> her<00:01:48.569> primed

00:01:48.919 --> 00:01:48.929 
on their own and I can get her primed

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:50.839 
on their own and I can get her primed
and<00:01:49.289> sorter<00:01:49.950> out<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.340> treat<00:01:50.549> her<00:01:50.669> I

00:01:50.839 --> 00:01:50.849 
and sorter out and treat her I

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:52.639 
and sorter out and treat her I
effectively<00:01:51.630> so<00:01:51.840> it<00:01:51.899> doesn't<00:01:52.200> keep<00:01:52.289> coming

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
allowing any additional bacteria into

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.559 
allowing any additional bacteria into
the<00:02:43.269> egg<00:02:43.480> itself<00:02:44.640> so<00:02:45.640> as<00:02:45.730> you<00:02:45.849> can<00:02:46.030> see<00:02:46.239> this<00:02:46.390> is

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
the egg itself so as you can see this is

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:49.500 
the egg itself so as you can see this is
the<00:02:46.690> area<00:02:47.049> there<00:02:47.230> that<00:02:47.260> I<00:02:47.530> want<00:02:47.739> to<00:02:47.799> swab<00:02:48.510> as

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
the area there that I want to swab as

00:02:49.510 --> 00:03:00.000 
the area there that I want to swab as
you<00:02:49.660> can<00:02:49.780> see<00:02:49.930> there<00:02:56.519> and<00:02:57.519> now<00:02:58.379> just<00:02:59.379> I<00:02:59.650> just

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
you can see there and now just I just

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.289 
you can see there and now just I just
set<00:03:00.549> the<00:03:00.700> girl<00:03:00.910> up

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299 
set the girl up

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:03.449 
set the girl up
so<00:03:01.569> literally<00:03:01.989> this<00:03:02.140> area<00:03:02.680> here<00:03:03.069> as<00:03:03.310> you<00:03:03.400> can

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
so literally this area here as you can

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:12.000 
so literally this area here as you can
see<00:03:03.579> where<00:03:04.090> the<00:03:04.209> eggs<00:03:04.390> are<00:03:04.629> in<00:03:10.379> between<00:03:11.379> the

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
see where the eggs are in between the

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.400 
see where the eggs are in between the
actual<00:03:12.480> event<00:03:13.480> in<00:03:13.660> the<00:03:13.810> middle<00:03:14.049> of<00:03:14.139> the<00:03:14.260> egg

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
actual event in the middle of the egg

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:32.870 
actual event in the middle of the egg
just<00:03:15.400> go<00:03:15.639> into<00:03:15.940> the<00:03:16.060> actual<00:03:16.299> egg<00:03:16.569> itself

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.270 

hmm<00:03:33.720> makes<00:03:34.320> a<00:03:34.410> little<00:03:34.500> bit<00:03:34.650> harder<00:03:35.010> on<00:03:35.070> your

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
needle steadier I'll just go in a

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:30.380 
needle steadier I'll just go in a
different<00:04:10.560> section<00:04:11.000> some<00:04:12.000> principle<00:04:12.480> applies

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
then we just wait and as you can see

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.720 
then we just wait and as you can see
it's<00:04:33.960> nice<00:04:34.170> and<00:04:34.200> not<00:04:34.860> on<00:04:34.980> video<00:04:35.160> sorry<00:04:35.550> about

it's nice and not on video sorry about
that<00:04:35.760> guys

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
that guys

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.490 
that guys
as<00:04:37.740> you<00:04:37.920> can<00:04:38.130> see<00:04:38.340> the<00:04:38.490> needles<00:04:38.820> filling<00:04:39.210> up

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
as you can see the needles filling up

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:45.670 
as you can see the needles filling up
the<00:04:40.500> syringe<00:04:40.830> is<00:04:41.040> filling<00:04:41.400> up<00:04:44.180> and<00:04:45.180> we're<00:04:45.330> just

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
the syringe is filling up and we're just

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.140 
the syringe is filling up and we're just
applying<00:04:46.680> a<00:04:46.950> bit<00:04:47.100> of<00:04:47.160> pressure<00:04:47.280> to<00:04:47.910> allow<00:04:48.090> the

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
applying a bit of pressure to allow the

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.980 
applying a bit of pressure to allow the
liquid<00:04:48.390> to<00:04:48.570> come<00:04:48.870> through<00:04:50.450> as<00:04:51.450> you<00:04:51.660> can<00:04:51.810> see

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
liquid to come through as you can see

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.970 
liquid to come through as you can see
the<00:04:52.140> eggs<00:04:52.320> already<00:04:52.560> getting<00:04:52.830> smaller<00:04:53.160> so<00:04:53.780> the

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:54.980 
the eggs already getting smaller so the

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.620 
the eggs already getting smaller so the
the<00:04:55.980> feces<00:04:56.460> that<00:04:56.490> was<00:04:56.790> around<00:04:57.090> it<00:04:57.330> is<00:04:57.480> actually

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
the feces that was around it is actually

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.880 
the feces that was around it is actually
coming<00:04:57.990> out<00:04:58.230> as<00:04:58.350> well<00:04:58.380> and<00:05:00.350> I'll<00:05:01.350> just<00:05:01.530> release

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:01.890 
coming out as well and I'll just release

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:06.170 
coming out as well and I'll just release
that<00:05:01.920> off<00:05:04.460> there's<00:05:05.460> a<00:05:05.520> lot<00:05:05.670> of<00:05:05.790> pressure<00:05:06.030> in

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
that off there's a lot of pressure in

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.150 
that off there's a lot of pressure in
there<00:05:06.390> already<00:05:06.690> and<00:05:07.020> as<00:05:07.230> you<00:05:07.620> can<00:05:07.740> see<00:05:08.010> it's

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 
there already and as you can see it's

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.240 
there already and as you can see it's
already<00:05:08.370> moved<00:05:08.730> see<00:05:09.060> I<00:05:09.650> could<00:05:10.650> probably<00:05:10.890> if<00:05:11.130> I

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
already moved see I could probably if I

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.830 
already moved see I could probably if I
wanted<00:05:11.520> to<00:05:12.470> apply<00:05:13.470> a<00:05:13.500> bit<00:05:13.620> of<00:05:13.710> pressure<00:05:13.770> and

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 
wanted to apply a bit of pressure and

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.070 
wanted to apply a bit of pressure and
force<00:05:15.840> that<00:05:15.900> I<00:05:16.080> go<00:05:17.450> there<00:05:18.450> you<00:05:18.540> go<00:05:18.690> just<00:05:18.900> like

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
force that I go there you go just like

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.460 
force that I go there you go just like
that<00:05:19.820> without<00:05:20.820> any<00:05:21.000> pressure<00:05:21.480> reduce<00:05:22.170> stress

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:22.470 
that without any pressure reduce stress

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:26.330 
that without any pressure reduce stress
to<00:05:22.620> the<00:05:22.740> girl<00:05:22.980> I<00:05:23.930> was<00:05:24.930> able<00:05:25.230> to<00:05:25.260> extract<00:05:26.040> enough

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
to the girl I was able to extract enough

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.650 
to the girl I was able to extract enough
liquid<00:05:27.120> to<00:05:28.250> assist<00:05:29.250> her<00:05:29.460> with<00:05:29.910> getting<00:05:30.570> the

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660 
liquid to assist her with getting the

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.450 
liquid to assist her with getting the
egg<00:05:30.810> out<00:05:31.020> under<00:05:31.470> non-service<00:05:31.980> tears<00:05:32.280> I

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
egg out under non-service tears I

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:33.440 
egg out under non-service tears I
probably<00:05:32.640> wouldn't<00:05:32.880> have<00:05:32.940> done<00:05:33.030> that<00:05:33.300> if

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:33.450 
probably wouldn't have done that if

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:35.300 
probably wouldn't have done that if
there<00:05:33.630> was<00:05:33.720> a<00:05:33.780> couple<00:05:34.020> of<00:05:34.170> others<00:05:34.440> I've<00:05:35.100> been

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 
there was a couple of others I've been

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:39.230 
there was a couple of others I've been
in<00:05:35.400> situations<00:05:36.090> also<00:05:36.300> where<00:05:37.880> they've<00:05:38.880> come

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 
in situations also where they've come

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.760 
in situations also where they've come
down<00:05:39.480> there's<00:05:39.750> been<00:05:39.900> a<00:05:39.930> whole<00:05:40.170> backlog<00:05:40.590> of

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:40.770 
down there's been a whole backlog of

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.680 
down there's been a whole backlog of
other<00:05:40.950> eggs<00:05:41.220> so<00:05:42.000> I'll<00:05:42.150> use<00:05:42.480> the<00:05:42.660> same

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
other eggs so I'll use the same

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:44.990 
other eggs so I'll use the same
technique<00:05:43.470> to<00:05:43.500> absorb<00:05:44.100> it<00:05:44.280> and<00:05:44.430> then<00:05:44.640> she<00:05:44.820> can

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
technique to absorb it and then she can

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.900 
technique to absorb it and then she can
actually<00:05:45.420> pass<00:05:46.020> this<00:05:46.320> egg<00:05:46.680> and<00:05:46.950> then<00:05:47.430> pass<00:05:47.640> all

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:47.910 
actually pass this egg and then pass all
