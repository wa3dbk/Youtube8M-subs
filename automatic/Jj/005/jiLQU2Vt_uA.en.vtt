they're<00:00:28.039> putting<00:00:28.340> me<00:00:28.430> to<00:00:28.580> the<00:00:28.610> test<00:00:28.730> this<00:00:29.180> is<00:00:29.330> a

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390 
they're putting me to the test this is a

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.300 
they're putting me to the test this is a
river<00:00:29.570> I've<00:00:29.779> never<00:00:29.990> been<00:00:30.200> to<00:00:30.439> before<00:00:30.560> let's<00:00:31.189> go

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:31.310 
river I've never been to before let's go

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:37.720 
river I've never been to before let's go
catch<00:00:31.550> some<00:00:31.700> fish<00:00:35.379> there<00:00:36.379> he<00:00:36.530> is<00:00:36.559> hits<00:00:37.550> a

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
catch some fish there he is hits a

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.460 
catch some fish there he is hits a
little<00:00:37.760> little<00:00:38.300> share<00:00:38.540> oh<00:00:40.540> yeah<00:00:41.540> he<00:00:42.350> was

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:42.470 
little little share oh yeah he was

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:43.900 
little little share oh yeah he was
pulling<00:00:42.680> like<00:00:42.920> a<00:00:42.949> small<00:00:43.309> wow<00:00:43.519> look<00:00:43.790> at<00:00:43.820> that

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
pulling like a small wow look at that

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.850 
pulling like a small wow look at that
it's<00:00:44.540> probably<00:00:44.900> not<00:00:45.050> a<00:00:45.080> lot<00:00:45.170> of<00:00:45.410> fishing<00:00:45.739> this

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
it's probably not a lot of fishing this

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.740 
it's probably not a lot of fishing this
river<00:00:45.949> system<00:00:46.519> because<00:00:46.790> if<00:00:46.970> there<00:00:47.150> is<00:00:47.180> those

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
river system because if there is those

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.360 
river system because if there is those
things<00:00:48.019> usually<00:00:48.260> get<00:00:48.559> eaten<00:00:48.739> before<00:00:48.980> they<00:00:49.250> get

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
things usually get eaten before they get

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.490 
things usually get eaten before they get
to<00:00:49.519> be<00:00:49.610> that<00:00:49.640> size<00:00:50.059> he<00:00:50.690> pulled<00:00:50.960> probably<00:00:51.320> hard

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
to be that size he pulled probably hard

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.320 
to be that size he pulled probably hard
as<00:00:51.589> a<00:00:51.650> small<00:00:51.920> well<00:00:52.160> it's<00:00:52.460> pretty<00:00:52.610> neat<00:00:52.879> I'm

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:53.330 
as a small well it's pretty neat I'm

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.000 
as a small well it's pretty neat I'm
going<00:00:53.720> to<00:00:53.780> try<00:00:53.930> to<00:00:53.989> pinpoint<00:00:54.379> the<00:00:54.710> bass<00:00:54.980> a

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
going to try to pinpoint the bass a

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.469 
going to try to pinpoint the bass a
little<00:00:55.160> bit<00:00:55.430> better<00:00:55.670> and<00:00:56.000> throw<00:00:56.180> it<00:00:56.239> right

Kentucky<00:01:04.309> bass<00:01:04.670> river<00:01:05.449> systems<00:01:05.840> like<00:01:05.960> that

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
Kentucky bass river systems like that

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.660 
Kentucky bass river systems like that
you<00:01:06.320> catch<00:01:06.500> that<00:01:06.530> size<00:01:07.100> fish<00:01:07.369> all<00:01:07.549> the<00:01:07.580> time

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
you catch that size fish all the time

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.399 
you catch that size fish all the time
it's<00:01:08.000> a<00:01:08.090> lot<00:01:08.240> of<00:01:08.360> fun<00:01:08.570> let's<00:01:08.930> go<00:01:09.049> try<00:01:09.260> to<00:01:09.290> find

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
it's a lot of fun let's go try to find

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:12.940 
it's a lot of fun let's go try to find
some<00:01:09.680> more<00:01:09.770> fish<00:01:10.070> minute<00:01:10.460> with<00:01:10.580> awesome<00:01:11.950> you

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
some more fish minute with awesome you

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.770 
some more fish minute with awesome you
know<00:01:13.010> my<00:01:13.130> thought<00:01:13.369> process<00:01:13.850> is<00:01:14.060> here<00:01:14.390> it's

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
know my thought process is here it's

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.390 
know my thought process is here it's
just<00:01:15.080> a<00:01:15.170> little<00:01:15.350> bit<00:01:15.500> too<00:01:15.680> much<00:01:15.799> current<00:01:16.280> the

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
just a little bit too much current the

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.039 
just a little bit too much current the
rivers<00:01:16.729> just<00:01:16.850> a<00:01:16.970> little<00:01:17.150> too<00:01:17.299> high<00:01:17.479> probably

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
rivers just a little too high probably

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:19.630 
rivers just a little too high probably
come<00:01:18.229> back<00:01:18.380> later<00:01:18.680> when<00:01:18.860> it's<00:01:19.040> lower<00:01:19.220> we're

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
come back later when it's lower we're

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.310 
come back later when it's lower we're
going<00:01:19.670> to<00:01:19.790> give<00:01:19.909> it<00:01:20.030> a<00:01:20.060> couple<00:01:20.240> more<00:01:20.390> cast<00:01:20.720> and

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
going to give it a couple more cast and

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:29.770 
going to give it a couple more cast and
then<00:01:21.409> we're<00:01:21.530> going<00:01:21.650> to<00:01:21.710> move<00:01:21.890> on<00:01:28.420> hey<00:01:29.420> this<00:01:29.600> is

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
then we're going to move on hey this is

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.179 
then we're going to move on hey this is
typically<00:01:30.229> what<00:01:30.320> we<00:01:30.469> find<00:01:30.740> on<00:01:30.890> the<00:01:30.979> river

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:31.189 
typically what we find on the river

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:32.709 
typically what we find on the river
system<00:01:31.579> you<00:01:31.670> got<00:01:31.820> a<00:01:31.880> little<00:01:31.969> cut<00:01:32.270> coming<00:01:32.630> in

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:32.719 
system you got a little cut coming in

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:34.300 
system you got a little cut coming in
here<00:01:33.020> all<00:01:33.469> I'm<00:01:33.649> gonna<00:01:33.770> do<00:01:33.859> is<00:01:33.890> throw<00:01:34.130> that
