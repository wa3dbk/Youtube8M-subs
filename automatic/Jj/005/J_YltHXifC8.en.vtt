00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 very good everyone here you are 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.470
 welcome to my advice at the time of 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.120
 I use the Monster Block 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:12.150
 Multiplayer servers are valid in such a way 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.219
 that would be fighting against people is 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.080
 say the pvp then I will give a couple 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.210
 of advice for you to be the most 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.210
 fast the most agile and that good 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.400
 can you even beat me in my series 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.960
 of battles against subscribers is worth 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.939
 Here I leave the link in case you want 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.529
 sign up and well maybe you are the 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.210
 selected to fight against me 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.980
 so far I have not lost any combat 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.719
 because I use the engine to one hundred 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.890
 a hundred then well let's go out here 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.320
 I find myself from the dragon server 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.550
 creative look how pretty how beautiful and 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.680
 hey guys used to give a couple of 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.290
 advice is good in equality 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.120
 conditions we are going to have to distribute 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.710
 well the training point is worth the 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.329
 training point are the points of 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.670
 skill is that good we 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.930
 we acquire here in this tab it's worth 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.250
 example I'm going to include let's go to 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:58.530
 put bar tvc pp worth training point and 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.350
 let's put a thousand thousand points 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.210
 distribute it 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.369
 so good if you do not have many 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.270
 points the advisable thing is that at the time 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:10.070
 to fight melee is to say 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:13.190
 close to a person is to attack him 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.920
 in the face it is worth going to his face and hitting him 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.540
 apalizar him good then then we go to 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.509
 have to distribute the points of 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.890
 talents in fist is worth it because it's fist 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:23.780
 this way we're going to hit a lot more 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.970
 strong and we will remove much more 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.500
 with which it is recommended 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.000
 distribute fists is good too 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.130
 because we are going to talk much faster 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.100
 Exactly right obviously you also know 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.899
 that with the X we can jump up going 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.880
 upwards then every time if you 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:40.610
 We put many points, so you are going to 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.420
 notice that every time I jump a lot 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.310
 faster 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.170
 worth and wanted higher and good in a 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.060
 sprint also the sprint already know that 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.350
 pressing the ere at the time of running 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.990
 to run around here to see if I do not fall 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.940
 of the world's axis, we're going to see that 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.080
 if I pulse the air I run a lot more 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.850
 fast which is also very 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.670
 advisable to see if subo is 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.679
 recommended then put the 30 points 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.600
 and the skill points is here in 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:05.090
 these four boxes this if we want 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.350
 attack at close range is worth 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.509
 we want to attack long 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.090
 distances the logical thing is that the first thing 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.430
 that we extend our kit is worth 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.850
 Notice that I have now 30 because if 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.260
 here we put 40 account worth x fix 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.959
 now up to the left we're going to 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.030
 have much more capacity to include 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.250
 here and in that way we will be able to launch 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.170
 many more probes and have to recharge 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.910
 the kill is good too 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.160
 if we want is to load the one that much more 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.770
 quick I want to remember that it was here 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.750
 load here ok let's see let's 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.930
 put it to 10 and let's see if it's logical 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.459
 this is going to launch a wave around here 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.830
 let's throw a +5 I think it was this 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:47.640
 I'm not sure the dragon 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:50.240
 to see how it hits or has hit support 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.620
 good to see everything agreed on 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:55.110
 equivalent 22 now as we have 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.940
 put points in loading here 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.830
 we go two seconds and he has loaded it 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.270
 well in this way we will be able to 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.010
 download the key much faster and 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.660
 we are going to have more time for then for 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.940
 that to be able to hit and good at 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:09.120
 ascend would be to access super 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:11.760
 saiyan is worth for example sorry we're going to 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.860
 put it here costs 20 points ie 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.290
 for every time we want to access it is a 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.090
 lot of trading points that costs us 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.950
 but I think it's worth it, I think 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.380
 and pressing the g well this way 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.450
 let's access super saiyans let's 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.300
 see what I wear without getting super 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.560
 saiyan or a lot of time there what 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.690
 I have super saiyan in this way 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.580
 we attacked a lot more strongly we have 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.200
 made twice as strong and good the 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.720
 combat you have practically won or 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.030
 whatever goal you see you win another of the 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.710
 things that I want to make clear is that it's worth 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.310
 I'm going to put this experiment very fast 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:46.440
 what does this do? 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.690
 no not the accepted thing that has happened water 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.360
 good fac I'm going to get to see wait a 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:54.060
 green wool moment here to see more wool 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.040
 green for me I think good enough 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.000
 what I want to say is that to see for 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.040
 hit him 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.410
 Host flew very fast I am super saiyan 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.540
 It's worth to hit exactly one 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.670
 person is very complicated with 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.620
 different waves that we have worth is very 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.720
 very complicated is to say you can not you 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.330
 throw a or kamehameha and hit the 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.160
 first because it is very complicated what 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.780
 I always advise is that we are very 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.489
 close to launching 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.720
 skills you already know that in my first 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.760
 combat 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.650
 I do not usually play it, not just throw 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.960
 skills and slingshot my head hash me 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.360
 or anything like that whenever you do not see 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.520
 to the quiet person or who really is 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.560
 very close if it is very close so 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.320
 I throw skills but if it's not very 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.390
 close and it's moving and so on what 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.490
 I do is approach and hit is the logical thing 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:41.560
 it's good then you're going to understand the 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.820
 difficulty because let's see I'm going to 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.640
 put me here for you to understand 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:48.510
 here I believe that perfect to return 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:50.860
 exactly one person has to be 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:52.990
 right here in the head between the 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:56.260
 head and body in this exact block 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:58.120
 that is to say at the time of hitting you have to 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.700
 hit just in the chest and in the 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:03.310
 head of the character if it's not going to 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.460
 hit if a block passes from where I am 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.789
 that is, happens 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:09.530
 you are not going to be able to say here it's worth not 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:12.620
 would hit the person with what is 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:14.660
 grow that is super complicated to hit 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.120
 Well now I 'm dying because I 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.979
 has come down from super saiyan for I'm going to 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.690
 get creative and that's it then 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:21.860
 well then start the difficulty is worth 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:24.199
 you have to be right there 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:27.020
 hitting him is super complicated because the 

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:29.599
 character understand that he is moving to 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:32.000
 for every second to jog two 

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:33.889
 blocks worth of minecraft fix you vale 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.050
 a second and it has already passed three blocks 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:37.820
 with which imagine you hit him with a 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:41.060
 kamehameha yes it is true that there 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:44.750
 some waves as like watching will 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:47.210
 to attack me well is not worth seeing 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:49.639
 neither but I'm going to put one in one 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:51.889
 skill is worth the final flash 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:54.710
 I 'm not finished 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:56.090
 this galactic is worth hitting the 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:06:00.919
 dragon and you are going to do what I want 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:03.529
 say just when hit there should 

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:04.909
 of being beaten the person does 

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:07.759
 true that as the galaxy gun you have 

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:10.460
 seen creates a wave that that wave if 

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:12.319
 catch the character as he will hit is 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.870
 say if the character is here and the 

00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:17.180
 wave hits here obviously to me 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:18.789
 I would hit it because the wave this I do not know 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.930
 if they were five blocks away 

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:22.159
 so good all these tips 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:24.560
 They come very well at the time of 

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:27.800
 multiplayer and you never know if any 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:30.710
 server will open a future with the mod 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.270
 installed dragon blocks obviously today 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:34.039
 in day there are not so many servers with 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:36.110
 the bot but because the bot has many 

00:06:34.039 --> 00:06:37.849
 bugs as you can understand once you 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:39.650
 solves the howitzer with time 

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:41.449
 go improving the versions and others 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:43.580
 right now the mode is found 1.1 

00:06:41.449 --> 00:06:46.699
 point 4 then once you advance those 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:48.589
 versions, yes there will be servers 

00:06:46.699 --> 00:06:49.999
 especially Americans I will bring you 

00:06:48.589 --> 00:06:52.460
 the channel is worth it and I'll see you there 

00:06:49.999 --> 00:06:54.259
 I even throw it away and warn me 

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:56.120
 then I will bring them to the channel so that 

00:06:54.259 --> 00:06:57.740
 we can enter with the mod and let's 

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.940
