 make a comparison with the version 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:17.520
 previous because in 1.6.4 the logo 

00:01:14.279 --> 00:01:18.840
 of the anget meyer altered writes now 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.729

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.729
 so we can more than just take it 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:27.329
 need we will open our Milan kinect 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:30.120

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:33.680

 put it to get there where you want it 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.119
 so ok the angera will open us 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.009
 automatically if we put the caridi 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:01.149
 all of course of the installation 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:03.610
 of the minecraft lager you have to do it with 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:05.649
 internet turned on with the latest version of 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.239
 ave installed to install the latest 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:11.769
 version of me is easy enough 

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:14.709
 go to the site of the hay go the dog up 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:16.630
 install accept the various terms ok 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:20.709
 after which the last one will be installed 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:22.660
 version then here I would have the 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.849
 our 1.7 launcher continues 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:28.260
 those read fine here version of 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:31.360
 Cassata issued for a long time between the two 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.840
 now what will we do but you have to 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:38.379
 institution minh city themes our name 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:44.139
 with which we play minecraft of course 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:49.109
 rex and I play there will be a bar 

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:49.109
 It would show that it will resist to indicate 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:56.609
 that the angeles are downloading and that snobs 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:00.010
 will also download the other packages 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:03.030
 so then we showed ex 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.030
 now they pay well 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:17.310
 here we can read in the console and that 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:19.940
 He is downloading the packages here and now 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:25.440
 we will have to wait for that green bar 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:28.500
 therefore it should appear to finish 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:31.319
 by ends it should come to the end it is 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.890
 that our green bar and should 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:36.180
 we must expect to finish 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:40.200
 so now pausing because 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:42.109

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.389
 green bar is almost running out of 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:46.260
 download all the files weighs almost 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:51.239
 to define 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:54.349
 here it is, but we hope from this 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.349

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:05.510
