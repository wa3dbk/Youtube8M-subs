00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
as they were the other day than when I

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:59.799 
as they were the other day than when I
was<00:00:57.559> here<00:00:57.620> but<00:00:58.210> but<00:00:59.210> they<00:00:59.329> are<00:00:59.450> starting<00:00:59.629> to

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
was here but but they are starting to

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.440 
was here but but they are starting to
fly<00:01:00.050> now<00:01:00.320> that's<00:01:00.980> the<00:01:01.190> key<00:01:01.370> and<00:01:01.579> uh<00:01:02.270> so<00:01:02.420> a

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:02.450 
fly now that's the key and uh so a

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.150 
fly now that's the key and uh so a
little<00:01:02.660> wind<00:01:02.899> you<00:01:03.020> early<00:01:03.350> and<00:01:03.469> I<00:01:03.710> think<00:01:03.920> they

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:04.160 
little wind you early and I think they

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.590 
little wind you early and I think they
like<00:01:04.339> the<00:01:04.369> flatter<00:01:04.699> water<00:01:05.000> to<00:01:05.239> I<00:01:05.270> think<00:01:05.509> you

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
like the flatter water to I think you

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.850 
like the flatter water to I think you
could<00:01:05.750> break<00:01:05.930> the<00:01:06.080> surface<00:01:06.289> attention<00:01:06.800> the

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
could break the surface attention the

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.170 
could break the surface attention the
water<00:01:07.009> a<00:01:07.100> little<00:01:07.250> easier<00:01:07.610> I<00:01:07.729> think<00:01:07.850> that's

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
water a little easier I think that's

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.529 
water a little easier I think that's
what<00:01:08.330> it<00:01:08.450> is<00:01:08.479> and<00:01:08.930> they<00:01:09.050> like<00:01:09.530> this<00:01:09.710> nice<00:01:09.920> calm

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
and cut it now we're going to measure

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.159 
and cut it now we're going to measure
where<00:04:26.789> our<00:04:26.940> legs<00:04:27.180> are<00:04:27.330> going<00:04:27.479> to<00:04:27.599> go<00:04:27.720> so<00:04:27.990> we've

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:28.169 
where our legs are going to go so we've

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:30.890 
where our legs are going to go so we've
got<00:04:28.320> a<00:04:28.349> little<00:04:28.740> slot<00:04:28.950> in<00:04:29.099> our<00:04:29.220> body

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
got a little slot in our body

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.570 
got a little slot in our body
we<00:04:31.900> just<00:04:32.080> make<00:04:32.560> sure<00:04:32.770> that<00:04:32.950> the<00:04:33.040> thread<00:04:33.310> is<00:04:33.430> it

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
we just make sure that the thread is it

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.160 
we just make sure that the thread is it
right<00:04:33.760> at<00:04:33.880> that<00:04:33.970> point<00:04:34.030> with<00:04:34.630> the<00:04:34.810> front<00:04:35.080> of

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:35.170 
right at that point with the front of

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:38.040 
right at that point with the front of
the<00:04:35.260> body<00:04:35.410> against<00:04:35.950> the<00:04:36.130> eye<00:04:36.160> of<00:04:36.490> the<00:04:36.580> hook<00:04:37.050> so

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
the body against the eye of the hook so

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.920 
the body against the eye of the hook so
that's<00:04:38.320> right<00:04:38.590> yeah<00:04:38.950> we<00:04:39.130> put<00:04:39.310> our<00:04:39.400> leg<00:04:39.610> in<00:04:40.530> and

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
that's right yeah we put our leg in and

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.310 
that's right yeah we put our leg in and
try<00:04:43.930> to<00:04:43.960> get<00:04:44.460> it<00:04:45.460> more<00:04:45.730> or<00:04:45.850> less<00:04:45.990> at<00:04:46.990> the<00:04:47.110> right

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
try to get it more or less at the right

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.430 
try to get it more or less at the right
angle<00:04:47.830> do<00:04:48.340> a<00:04:48.400> nice<00:04:48.580> soft<00:04:48.910> loop<00:04:49.180> just<00:04:50.170> to<00:04:50.260> hold

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
angle do a nice soft loop just to hold

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.770 
angle do a nice soft loop just to hold
it<00:04:50.590> in<00:04:50.740> another<00:04:51.280> soft<00:04:51.580> loop<00:04:51.820> and<00:04:52.090> then<00:04:52.510> come

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
it in another soft loop and then come

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.260 
it in another soft loop and then come
back<00:04:52.810> and<00:04:53.260> do<00:04:53.350> the<00:04:53.530> couple<00:04:54.070> of<00:04:54.130> soft<00:04:54.370> loops<00:04:54.640> the

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
back and do the couple of soft loops the

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.450 
back and do the couple of soft loops the
other<00:04:55.420> way<00:04:55.690> and<00:04:56.080> then<00:04:56.650> we<00:04:56.740> bring<00:04:56.950> our<00:04:57.100> thread

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
other way and then we bring our thread

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.150 
other way and then we bring our thread
back<00:04:57.850> to<00:04:58.480> the<00:04:58.570> front<00:04:58.810> of<00:04:58.930> the<00:04:58.990> hook<00:04:59.200> and<00:04:59.680> at

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 
back to the front of the hook and at

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.870 
back to the front of the hook and at
this<00:05:00.280> point<00:05:00.550> we<00:05:01.360> can<00:05:01.660> whip<00:05:02.440> finish<00:05:02.830> now<00:05:03.640> we're

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 
this point we can whip finish now we're

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.930 
this point we can whip finish now we're
going<00:05:04.000> to<00:05:04.060> put<00:05:04.210> a<00:05:04.240> little<00:05:04.420> bit<00:05:04.510> of<00:05:04.750> aqua<00:05:05.560> seal

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
going to put a little bit of aqua seal

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.040 
going to put a little bit of aqua seal
squeeze<00:05:06.940> a<00:05:06.970> little<00:05:07.150> bit<00:05:07.270> out<00:05:07.450> of<00:05:07.480> the<00:05:07.570> tube<00:05:07.870> and

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050

just pick it up on a needle and then we
just<00:05:10.300> spread<00:05:10.570> that<00:05:10.600> along<00:05:11.410> the<00:05:11.650> hook<00:05:12.120> like<00:05:13.120> so

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:13.390 
just spread that along the hook like so

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:17.310 
just spread that along the hook like so
and<00:05:14.320> now<00:05:14.380> we<00:05:14.650> put<00:05:15.130> a<00:05:15.160> body<00:05:15.490> on<00:05:15.640> to<00:05:16.420> the<00:05:16.540> hook<00:05:16.750> by

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320 
and now we put a body on to the hook by

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.190 
and now we put a body on to the hook by
bending<00:05:17.350> it<00:05:17.890> like<00:05:18.610> that<00:05:18.850> just<00:05:19.450> pushing<00:05:19.870> up<00:05:19.990> and
