00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.990
 the optical illusion of the neiker cube today 

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:08.029
 friends, I bring you an illusion 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.340
 optics or an example or an exercise 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:12.560
 mentally calling as you want me to believe 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.720
 that you're going to like a lot, it's about 

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.279
 a cube this cube when I put it in 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.800
 the video you have to watch 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:20.990
 during we put about ten more seconds 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.880
 or less and you have to tell me if I 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.310
 you have seen first from above or what 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.199
 you have seen first from below also 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.840
 I want you to tell me if you are able to 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:32.359
 toggle the display between up and 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.339
 down so I put you directly the 

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:37.239
 image and look at it for about 10 

00:00:34.339 --> 00:00:37.239
 seconds approximately 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.650
 very good now that we've seen the 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.060
 picture tell me you have seen first 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.430
 from above you have seen it first 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:56.680
 from below you are able to intersperse 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.360
 the two visualizations is to say our 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.070
 brain has been able to see it first 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.010
 from above or first from below and 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.930
 then vice versa it is very likely that the 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.090
 answer to this second question be 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.640
 that if I put that the brain does not know 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.750
 actually what geometric figure 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.540
 show us so after a while 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.910
 shows us the alternative is to say 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.890
 second way of visualizing the cube and 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.290
 either from above or from this one from 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.020
 down the most interesting thing about this 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.610
 exercise is that some psychoanalysts 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.200
 they say that if the first thing we've seen 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.450
 it has been the cube from above us 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.369
 we have a relatively low self-esteem 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.170
 elevated is to say above the average 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:33.910
 and if the first thing we have seen has been 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.580
 the cube from below we have a 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:38.290
 lower self - esteem of the average still 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.970
 do not worry if the first thing that 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.910
 you have seen has been the cube from below 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.410
 there is not too much scientific evidence 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.270
 regarding self-esteem so 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.850
 you should not worry but I think 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.680
 it's a pretty interesting exercise and 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.360
 I'm sure you'll like to share it 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.320
 with your friends to analyze more or 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.320
 less what kind 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.659
 self-esteem can have as you see it and 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.950
 especially as you have seen the cube 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:01.930
 first time leave me in the 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.170
 comments and see you in the next 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.170
 video
