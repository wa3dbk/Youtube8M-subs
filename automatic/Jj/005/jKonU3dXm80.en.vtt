00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:04.010
 how 

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:10.030
 but 

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.030
 need a lot 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.130
 I 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.310
 but no 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.770
 and 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.990
 it feels 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.420
 To the concert 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:05.129
 Y 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.129
 and at times 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:20.060
 take hits and I hope to have insurance 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:24.970
 endures a lot and then with all help is 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.970
 a victory people 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.360
 i 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:41.010
 practically winning all 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.580
 the towel and we are going back to your 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.430
 alignment is a fight 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:48.150
 forgive precisely and also I do not believe 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.150
 I'm going to say this 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.030
 what 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.550
 let's get out of that fight 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.900
 physically 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.170
 there are many abilities per subtitle per 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.540
 your story and effectively see how 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:36.940
 You comment chocolatito already said he was going 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.940
 your titles and wants to give you that rematch 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:51.230
 with the team the opportunity 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:07.690
 because I think more than anything 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.690
 you are watching the fight 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:21.250
 we had to win and yet now you 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.840
 well you feel strong to be able to be 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:27.370
 and which one 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:31.290
 we always know that we can win and 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.290
 now the different 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.170
 yes 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.850
 countryman 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:17.360
 but more than anything then 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.360
 by come to support me 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.850
 gloria gave this time and they sent us photos 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:28.610
 of giant screens that they put in 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:31.780
 pretty very happy with all that is what 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.780
 that says 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.560
 the truth that he was not scared at 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.270
 otherwise I was excited because I say 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:59.030
 what I was worth 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:59.030
 I thought it was going to be thanks to us 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:04.360
 one hour already for the public and that's what 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.360
 what is 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:19.470
 here one of these goals in this 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:22.200
 fight was to convince him 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:25.860
 the hobby of the rest of the country that does not 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:28.260
 I was missing to follow you for believing ancient 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.930
 boxer you think with this victory and 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.940
 the way 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:34.940
 holding and 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.940
 ace 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:45.440
 good more than anything because 

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:03.950
 I think people who have supported 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:03.950
 giovani 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:13.510
 It occurs anywhere in the world 

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:22.369
 before two 

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:30.420
 first I thought it was going to be more 

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:54.210
 two 

00:06:56.159 --> 00:06:59.159
 callus
