to install even done one handedly very
easy<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.379> it<00:00:46.860> slips<00:00:47.160> right<00:00:47.399> in<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.820> little<00:00:48.300> too

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510

easy actually let me get into that a
little<00:00:50.370> bit<00:00:50.579> later<00:00:50.840> but<00:00:51.840> it<00:00:52.020> is<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.170> flip<00:00:52.620> case

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
little bit later but it is a flip case

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
charge it like this then this is going

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.039 
charge it like this then this is going
to<00:02:55.109> be<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.410> case<00:02:55.620> for<00:02:55.650> you<00:02:56.069> but<00:02:56.940> there<00:02:57.840> are

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
to be the case for you but there are

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.349 
to be the case for you but there are
some<00:02:58.260> problems<00:02:58.530> with<00:02:58.769> this<00:02:59.010> case<00:02:59.280> and<00:02:59.340> I<00:03:00.329> think

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:00.359 
some problems with this case and I think

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:03.289 
some problems with this case and I think
it's<00:03:00.720> a<00:03:00.810> fatal<00:03:01.290> one<00:03:01.500> so<00:03:02.160> let's<00:03:02.640> take<00:03:02.819> a<00:03:02.879> look<00:03:03.150> at

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
it's a fatal one so let's take a look at

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:05.660 
it's a fatal one so let's take a look at
that<00:03:03.450> and<00:03:03.720> you<00:03:04.379> can<00:03:04.680> decide<00:03:04.950> after<00:03:05.190> this<00:03:05.459> if

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
that and you can decide after this if

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.380 
that and you can decide after this if
you<00:03:05.790> want<00:03:06.030> this<00:03:06.150> case<00:03:07.519> like<00:03:08.519> all<00:03:08.730> book<00:03:09.120> style

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
you want this case like all book style

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.180 
you want this case like all book style
cases<00:03:09.900> the<00:03:10.140> flaw<00:03:10.379> is<00:03:10.650> that<00:03:10.680> there's<00:03:11.099> no

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
cases the flaw is that there's no

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.130 
cases the flaw is that there's no
magnetic<00:03:11.670> latch<00:03:12.060> or<00:03:12.299> anything<00:03:12.629> so<00:03:12.870> it<00:03:12.989> just

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
magnetic latch or anything so it just

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.780 
magnetic latch or anything so it just
kind<00:03:13.319> of<00:03:13.349> stays<00:03:13.590> open<00:03:13.829> but<00:03:14.340> it's<00:03:14.489> heavy<00:03:14.700> enough

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
kind of stays open but it's heavy enough

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.550 
kind of stays open but it's heavy enough
to<00:03:15.239> where<00:03:15.420> it's<00:03:15.569> at<00:03:15.690> least<00:03:15.810> it's<00:03:15.989> not<00:03:16.049> gaping

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
to where it's at least it's not gaping

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.620 
to where it's at least it's not gaping
open<00:03:16.650> like<00:03:16.980> the<00:03:17.099> Samsung<00:03:17.549> one<00:03:17.760> but<00:03:18.510> the

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
open like the Samsung one but the

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.470 
open like the Samsung one but the
problem<00:03:18.900> with<00:03:19.319> this<00:03:19.560> is<00:03:19.769> that<00:03:19.859> these<00:03:20.849> corners

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
problem with this is that these corners

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.220 
problem with this is that these corners
are<00:03:21.720> just<00:03:22.470> so<00:03:22.829> easy<00:03:23.400> to<00:03:23.910> come<00:03:24.150> off<00:03:24.359> and<00:03:24.630> you

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
are just so easy to come off and you

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.710 
are just so easy to come off and you
barely<00:03:25.560> have<00:03:25.769> to<00:03:25.919> touch<00:03:26.130> it<00:03:26.160> at<00:03:26.430> all<00:03:26.579> and<00:03:26.970> it

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
barely have to touch it at all and it

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.120 
barely have to touch it at all and it
just<00:03:27.930> feels<00:03:28.200> like<00:03:28.290> it's<00:03:28.380> coming<00:03:28.739> out<00:03:28.859> it's<00:03:28.950> not

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
just feels like it's coming out it's not

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.740 
just feels like it's coming out it's not
really<00:03:29.489> a<00:03:29.519> tight<00:03:29.880> fit<00:03:30.209> it<00:03:30.359> doesn't<00:03:30.630> move

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
really a tight fit it doesn't move

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.650 
really a tight fit it doesn't move
around<00:03:30.930> in<00:03:31.470> the<00:03:31.590> case<00:03:31.829> too<00:03:32.190> and<00:03:32.489> look<00:03:33.480> at<00:03:33.569> how

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
around in the case too and look at how

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.050 
around in the case too and look at how
easy<00:03:34.079> this<00:03:34.380> is<00:03:34.440> to<00:03:34.829> push<00:03:35.130> off<00:03:35.340> of<00:03:35.519> there<00:03:35.669> this

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
easy this is to push off of there this

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.089 
easy this is to push off of there this
is<00:03:36.209> just<00:03:36.419> a<00:03:36.510> little<00:03:36.660> plastic<00:03:36.959> squeegee<00:03:37.530> that<00:03:37.919> I

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:38.099 
is just a little plastic squeegee that I

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:40.190 
is just a little plastic squeegee that I
use<00:03:38.310> to<00:03:38.340> put<00:03:38.639> on<00:03:38.730> screen<00:03:39.120> protectors<00:03:39.630> and<00:03:39.840> look

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
use to put on screen protectors and look

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.430 
use to put on screen protectors and look
at<00:03:40.380> how<00:03:40.620> easy<00:03:41.040> that<00:03:41.370> is<00:03:41.750> it<00:03:42.750> only<00:03:42.989> takes<00:03:43.230> a

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
at how easy that is it only takes a

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.500 
at how easy that is it only takes a
minimal<00:03:43.980> amount<00:03:44.190> of<00:03:44.579> pressure<00:03:44.790> to<00:03:45.180> make<00:03:45.329> that

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
minimal amount of pressure to make that

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.110 
minimal amount of pressure to make that
thing<00:03:45.690> just<00:03:45.810> fly<00:03:46.169> out<00:03:46.380> of<00:03:46.410> there<00:03:46.680> as<00:03:47.120> evidenced

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
thing just fly out of there as evidenced

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.300 
thing just fly out of there as evidenced
by<00:03:48.150> this<00:03:48.329> you<00:03:48.930> just<00:03:49.169> push<00:03:49.709> it<00:03:49.739> up<00:03:49.980> a<00:03:50.069> little<00:03:50.190> bit

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
by this you just push it up a little bit

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.330 
by this you just push it up a little bit
it's<00:03:50.940> flying<00:03:51.450> right<00:03:51.750> out<00:03:51.780> of<00:03:51.930> there<00:03:52.169> but<00:03:52.889> is

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
it's flying right out of there but is

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.300 
it's flying right out of there but is
this<00:03:53.730> an<00:03:53.970> engineering<00:03:54.510> feat<00:03:54.780> by<00:03:55.019> HTC<00:03:55.470> because

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
this an engineering feat by HTC because

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.309 
this an engineering feat by HTC because
of<00:03:56.459> the<00:03:56.549> fact<00:03:56.819> that<00:03:56.970> I<00:03:57.299> cannot<00:03:57.780> get<00:03:57.989> this<00:03:58.109> thing

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
of the fact that I cannot get this thing

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:00.199 
of the fact that I cannot get this thing
to<00:03:58.410> fly<00:03:58.650> off<00:03:58.859> any<00:03:59.160> other<00:03:59.400> way<00:03:59.609> so<00:04:00.000> if<00:04:00.090> you're

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
to fly off any other way so if you're

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:01.699 
to fly off any other way so if you're
worried<00:04:00.450> about<00:04:00.569> this<00:04:00.930> thing<00:04:01.139> coming<00:04:01.560> out

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
worried about this thing coming out

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.670 
worried about this thing coming out
while<00:04:02.129> it's<00:04:02.280> in<00:04:02.430> the<00:04:02.549> case<00:04:02.819> or<00:04:03.200> just<00:04:04.200> randomly

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
while it's in the case or just randomly

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.319 
while it's in the case or just randomly
falling<00:04:05.069> out<00:04:05.280> of<00:04:05.400> there<00:04:05.549> it's<00:04:05.760> not<00:04:05.940> happening

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:06.329 
falling out of there it's not happening

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:08.839 
falling out of there it's not happening
because<00:04:06.599> I'm<00:04:07.139> trying<00:04:07.889> to<00:04:08.129> get<00:04:08.250> this<00:04:08.400> thing<00:04:08.459> fly

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:08.849 
because I'm trying to get this thing fly

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:12.289 
because I'm trying to get this thing fly
out<00:04:09.030> of<00:04:09.060> there<00:04:09.239> and<00:04:09.510> it's<00:04:09.750> not<00:04:09.900> so<00:04:11.209> even<00:04:12.209> though

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
out of there and it's not so even though

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:14.659 
out of there and it's not so even though
it<00:04:12.449> feels<00:04:12.720> really<00:04:13.079> flimsy<00:04:13.470> in<00:04:13.919> the<00:04:14.160> hand<00:04:14.459> while

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:14.669 
it feels really flimsy in the hand while

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:15.800 
it feels really flimsy in the hand while
you<00:04:14.790> have<00:04:14.940> it<00:04:14.970> in<00:04:15.120> there<00:04:15.269> and<00:04:15.299> it<00:04:15.449> feels<00:04:15.690> like

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
you have it in there and it feels like

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.240 
you have it in there and it feels like
it's<00:04:15.989> going<00:04:16.109> to<00:04:16.139> fly<00:04:16.440> out<00:04:16.650> of<00:04:16.680> there<00:04:16.979> it

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
it's going to fly out of there it

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.270 
it's going to fly out of there it
doesn't<00:04:18.120> come<00:04:18.479> out<00:04:18.599> of<00:04:18.660> there<00:04:18.930> on<00:04:19.139> daily<00:04:20.010> use

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
doesn't come out of there on daily use

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.180 
doesn't come out of there on daily use
but<00:04:20.970> it<00:04:21.209> does<00:04:21.660> feel<00:04:22.380> like<00:04:22.620> it's<00:04:22.890> going<00:04:23.010> to<00:04:23.039> come

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
but it does feel like it's going to come

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.950 
but it does feel like it's going to come
out<00:04:23.310> of<00:04:23.370> there<00:04:23.580> and<00:04:23.669> if<00:04:23.789> you<00:04:23.909> do<00:04:24.090> tap<00:04:24.570> it<00:04:24.780> like

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
out of there and if you do tap it like

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.530 
out of there and if you do tap it like
with<00:04:25.380> the<00:04:25.469> finger<00:04:25.770> like<00:04:26.039> I<00:04:26.159> showed<00:04:26.340> you<00:04:26.430> before

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
with the finger like I showed you before

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.780 
with the finger like I showed you before
it's<00:04:27.630> gonna<00:04:27.750> come<00:04:27.990> out<00:04:28.110> of<00:04:28.170> there<00:04:28.440> so<00:04:29.010> what<00:04:29.730> do

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:29.790 
it's gonna come out of there so what do

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:30.920 
it's gonna come out of there so what do
you<00:04:29.850> guys<00:04:29.940> think<00:04:30.000> of<00:04:30.240> that<00:04:30.420> do<00:04:30.570> you<00:04:30.600> think<00:04:30.810> this

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
you guys think of that do you think this

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.290 
you guys think of that do you think this
is<00:04:31.110> something<00:04:31.440> that<00:04:31.620> makes<00:04:32.220> you<00:04:32.460> not<00:04:33.000> want<00:04:33.060> to

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
is something that makes you not want to

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.300 
is something that makes you not want to
buy<00:04:33.450> this<00:04:33.510> case<00:04:33.870> I<00:04:34.110> think<00:04:34.470> this<00:04:34.860> is<00:04:35.100> something

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
buy this case I think this is something

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:36.830 
buy this case I think this is something
that<00:04:35.460> definitely<00:04:36.030> people<00:04:36.570> need<00:04:36.720> to<00:04:36.750> know

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
that definitely people need to know

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.170 
that definitely people need to know
about<00:04:37.110> because<00:04:37.770> it<00:04:37.890> just<00:04:38.070> doesn't<00:04:38.280> feel<00:04:38.670> that

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
about because it just doesn't feel that

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.480 
about because it just doesn't feel that
good<00:04:39.570> and<00:04:39.960> it<00:04:40.110> doesn't<00:04:40.290> feel<00:04:40.440> secure<00:04:41.160> in<00:04:41.190> there

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
good and it doesn't feel secure in there

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.100 
good and it doesn't feel secure in there
even<00:04:41.880> though<00:04:41.970> I<00:04:42.000> couldn't<00:04:42.450> get<00:04:42.570> it<00:04:42.690> to<00:04:42.780> fly<00:04:42.990> out

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
even though I couldn't get it to fly out

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.640 
even though I couldn't get it to fly out
of<00:04:43.170> there<00:04:43.350> so<00:04:44.040> what<00:04:44.490> do<00:04:44.550> you<00:04:44.670> think<00:04:45.200> my<00:04:46.200> opinion

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
of there so what do you think my opinion

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.080 
of there so what do you think my opinion
is<00:04:46.830> that<00:04:46.860> if<00:04:47.280> you're<00:04:47.400> going<00:04:47.520> to<00:04:47.580> spend<00:04:47.790> thirty

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
is that if you're going to spend thirty

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.970 
is that if you're going to spend thirty
dollars<00:04:48.390> for<00:04:48.600> a<00:04:48.630> case<00:04:48.870> you<00:04:49.380> might<00:04:49.530> have<00:04:49.830> it

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:49.980 
dollars for a case you might have it

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.010 
dollars for a case you might have it
work<00:04:50.130> all<00:04:50.340> the<00:04:50.460> way<00:04:50.490> so<00:04:51.270> I<00:04:51.300> would<00:04:51.630> not<00:04:51.780> buy<00:04:51.960> this

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
work all the way so I would not buy this

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.110 
work all the way so I would not buy this
as<00:04:52.320> a<00:04:52.350> primary<00:04:52.680> case<00:04:53.100> but<00:04:53.550> if<00:04:53.670> you<00:04:53.820> wanted<00:04:54.030> to

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
as a primary case but if you wanted to

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.730 
as a primary case but if you wanted to
have<00:04:54.240> a<00:04:54.270> case<00:04:54.600> that<00:04:55.050> you<00:04:55.260> want<00:04:55.440> to<00:04:55.470> use<00:04:55.530> that

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
have a case that you want to use that

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.130 
have a case that you want to use that
kickstand<00:04:56.280> functionality<00:04:57.060> and<00:04:57.240> it<00:04:57.840> looks

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:58.140 
kickstand functionality and it looks

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.080 
kickstand functionality and it looks
nice<00:04:58.380> they're<00:04:59.040> not<00:04:59.160> go<00:04:59.370> and<00:04:59.520> buy<00:04:59.640> this<00:04:59.700> for<00:05:00.030> a

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
nice they're not go and buy this for a

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.450 
nice they're not go and buy this for a
second<00:05:00.540> case<00:05:00.750> but<00:05:01.620> I<00:05:01.650> would<00:05:01.890> not<00:05:02.010> use<00:05:02.220> it<00:05:02.340> as<00:05:02.430> a

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
second case but I would not use it as a

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.670 
second case but I would not use it as a
primary<00:05:02.760> case<00:05:03.180> all<00:05:03.510> right<00:05:04.080> that<00:05:04.230> does<00:05:04.260> it<00:05:04.440> for

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
primary case all right that does it for

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.740 
primary case all right that does it for
me<00:05:04.860> but<00:05:05.100> just<00:05:05.130> take<00:05:05.430> one<00:05:05.640> second<00:05:06.060> and<00:05:06.180> hit<00:05:06.720> that

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
me but just take one second and hit that

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.930 
me but just take one second and hit that
like<00:05:06.990> button<00:05:07.230> for<00:05:07.740> that<00:05:08.070> helps<00:05:08.430> a<00:05:08.520> ton<00:05:08.550> and
