00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
whitewater rafting the energy has been

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.360 
whitewater rafting the energy has been
so<00:00:38.280> so<00:00:38.670> strong<00:00:39.110> but<00:00:40.110> we're<00:00:40.260> now<00:00:40.500> stepping<00:00:41.010> into

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
so so strong but we're now stepping into

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.450 
so so strong but we're now stepping into
a<00:00:41.879> new<00:00:41.910> episode<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.170> this<00:00:43.860> feels<00:00:44.129> much

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
a new episode and this feels much

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.090 
a new episode and this feels much
steadier<00:00:44.870> we<00:00:45.870> are<00:00:45.960> still<00:00:46.230> going<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.469> feel<00:00:46.500> the

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
steadier we are still going to feel the

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.190 
steadier we are still going to feel the
effect<00:00:47.399> of<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.730> urines<00:00:48.300> Pluto<00:00:48.629> square<00:00:48.989> for

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
effect of the urines Pluto square for

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.810 
effect of the urines Pluto square for
the<00:00:49.260> next<00:00:49.559> year<00:00:49.829> although<00:00:50.039> we've<00:00:50.460> moved<00:00:50.730> past

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
the next year although we've moved past

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.420 
the next year although we've moved past
what<00:00:51.270> is<00:00:51.420> called<00:00:51.629> exactitude<00:00:52.230> it<00:00:52.860> is<00:00:53.160> still<00:00:53.399> a

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
what is called exactitude it is still a

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.270 
what is called exactitude it is still a
square<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:54.059> slightly<00:00:54.329> looser<00:00:54.660> square<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.350> we

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
square a slightly looser square and we

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.160 
square a slightly looser square and we
will<00:00:56.460> still<00:00:56.699> feel<00:00:56.940> its<00:00:57.239> influence<00:00:57.870> and

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
will still feel its influence and

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.920 
will still feel its influence and
remember<00:00:58.680> that<00:00:59.059> Uranus<00:01:00.059> is<00:01:00.300> very<00:01:00.750> much

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
remember that Uranus is very much

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.009 
remember that Uranus is very much
associated<00:01:01.289> with<00:01:01.859> awakening<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.750> Pluto<00:01:03.750> is

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
associated with awakening and Pluto is

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.230 
associated with awakening and Pluto is
associated<00:01:04.650> with<00:01:05.060> transformation<00:01:06.060> and

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
associated with transformation and

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.750 
associated with transformation and
empowerment<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.409> that's<00:01:07.770> really<00:01:08.189> what<00:01:08.549> that

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
empowerment and that's really what that

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.450 
empowerment and that's really what that
process<00:01:09.030> is<00:01:09.479> about<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:09.960> sometimes

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
process is about it sometimes

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.100 
process is about it sometimes
uncomfortable<00:01:11.460> but<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.150> gets<00:01:12.360> us<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.780> where<00:01:12.960> we

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
uncomfortable but it gets us to where we

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.560 
uncomfortable but it gets us to where we
need<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.470> be<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.890> shake<00:01:14.159> us<00:01:14.369> out<00:01:14.549> of<00:01:14.820> those<00:01:15.210> old

what<00:02:38.430> helps<00:02:38.730> us<00:02:38.819> even<00:02:39.120> more<00:02:39.150> on<00:02:39.660> the

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
what helps us even more on the

seventeenth of April is Mars is square
to<00:02:43.590> Jupiter<00:02:44.280> and<00:02:44.569> this<00:02:45.569> is<00:02:45.750> a<00:02:45.780> great<00:02:46.170> time<00:02:46.680> to

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
to Jupiter and this is a great time to

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.540 
to Jupiter and this is a great time to
forge<00:02:47.970> ahead<00:02:48.239> with<00:02:48.480> a<00:02:48.840> new<00:02:49.110> project<00:02:49.709> this

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
forge ahead with a new project this

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.210 
forge ahead with a new project this
gives<00:02:50.819> a<00:02:50.940> very<00:02:51.060> good<00:02:51.330> sense<00:02:51.540> of<00:02:51.870> timing<00:02:52.380> it

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
gives a very good sense of timing it

gives a lot of confidence and it gives a

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.220 
gives a lot of confidence and it gives a

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
lot of very focused energy so if you're

mid month that would be a very good day
to<00:03:03.930> do<00:03:04.319> it<00:03:04.350> on<00:03:05.510> the<00:03:06.510> seventeenth<00:03:07.049> also<00:03:08.010> and<00:03:08.310> the

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
to do it on the seventeenth also and the

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.390 
to do it on the seventeenth also and the
16th<00:03:09.090> in<00:03:09.299> fact<00:03:09.569> Pluto<00:03:10.049> is<00:03:10.380> stationary<00:03:11.280> it

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
16th in fact Pluto is stationary it

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.750 
16th in fact Pluto is stationary it
moves<00:03:11.640> from<00:03:12.560> direct<00:03:13.560> motion<00:03:14.100> to<00:03:14.370> retrograde

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
moves from direct motion to retrograde

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.610

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
but for those two days it remains

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.650 
but for those two days it remains
stationary<00:03:17.040> and<00:03:17.609> whenever<00:03:17.790> a<00:03:18.030> planet<00:03:18.510> is

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660

becomes<00:03:21.810> magnified<00:03:22.489> so<00:03:23.489> Pluto's<00:03:23.970> all<00:03:24.180> about

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
becomes magnified so Pluto's all about

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.259 
becomes magnified so Pluto's all about
power<00:03:24.780> it's<00:03:25.650> also<00:03:25.799> about<00:03:26.010> cover-ups<00:03:26.579> so<00:03:27.120> we

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
power it's also about cover-ups so we

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.210 
power it's also about cover-ups so we
might<00:03:27.450> see<00:03:27.660> those<00:03:27.870> issues<00:03:28.320> coming<00:03:28.920> to<00:03:29.130> the
