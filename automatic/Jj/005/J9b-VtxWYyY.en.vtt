this set the way this works is you take
your<00:00:57.149> stone<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:57.719> take<00:00:57.899> these<00:00:57.989> guide<00:00:58.230> rods

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
your stone and you take these guide rods

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.130 
your stone and you take these guide rods
and<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:58.859> just<00:00:59.039> clamp<00:00:59.309> that<00:00:59.719> with<00:01:00.719> this<00:01:00.840> little

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
and you just clamp that with this little

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.210 
and you just clamp that with this little
screw<00:01:01.379> onto<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.859> stone<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.840> then<00:01:04.100> then<00:01:05.100> you

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
screw onto the stone and then then you

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.170 
screw onto the stone and then then you
have<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.430> clamp<00:01:06.619> make<00:01:07.619> sure<00:01:07.830> this<00:01:07.950> clamp<00:01:08.369> if<00:01:09.030> you

it in the knotch tighten it and I'm

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.699 
it in the knotch tighten it and I'm
gonna<00:02:09.119> really<00:02:09.420> just<00:02:09.720> tighten

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
gonna really just tighten

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.849 
gonna really just tighten
about<00:02:11.039> as<00:02:11.159> tight<00:02:11.579> as<00:02:11.819> I<00:02:11.969> can<00:02:12.030> feel<00:02:12.620> to<00:02:13.620> keep

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:13.859 
about as tight as I can feel to keep

00:02:13.859 --> 00:02:15.500 
about as tight as I can feel to keep
this<00:02:14.040> thing<00:02:14.099> in<00:02:14.430> there<00:02:14.640> now<00:02:15.150> I<00:02:15.180> got<00:02:15.329> it<00:02:15.420> in

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
this thing in there now I got it in

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.140 
this thing in there now I got it in
there<00:02:15.629> pretty<00:02:15.870> tight<00:02:16.790> that's<00:02:17.790> one<00:02:18.000> of<00:02:18.060> the

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
there pretty tight that's one of the

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.520 
there pretty tight that's one of the
hardest<00:02:18.390> things<00:02:18.569> is<00:02:18.719> getting<00:02:19.019> a<00:02:19.079> knife<00:02:19.260> not

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
hardest things is getting a knife not

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.780 
hardest things is getting a knife not
the<00:02:19.680> to<00:02:20.370> clamp<00:02:20.609> in<00:02:20.790> tight<00:02:22.280> the<00:02:23.280> next<00:02:23.519> thing<00:02:23.670> you

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
the to clamp in tight the next thing you

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.699 
the to clamp in tight the next thing you
would<00:02:23.909> do<00:02:24.090> is<00:02:24.269> you<00:02:24.599> would<00:02:24.629> select<00:02:25.140> your<00:02:25.439> angle

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
would do is you would select your angle

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.530 
would do is you would select your angle
you<00:02:25.829> want<00:02:25.980> I'm<00:02:26.640> gonna<00:02:26.819> put<00:02:26.939> this<00:02:27.060> in<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.329> third

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
you want I'm gonna put this in the third

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.500 
you want I'm gonna put this in the third
hole<00:02:27.719> which<00:02:27.900> is<00:02:28.049> 25<00:02:28.500> degrees<00:02:29.269> then<00:02:30.269> I<00:02:30.389> would

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
hole which is 25 degrees then I would

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.410 
hole which is 25 degrees then I would
start<00:02:30.750> at<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:30.930> tip<00:02:31.139> and<00:02:31.590> as<00:02:32.579> I<00:02:32.700> stroke<00:02:33.090> down<00:02:33.359> I

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
start at the tip and as I stroke down I

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:39.289 
start at the tip and as I stroke down I
just<00:02:33.840> stroke<00:02:34.200> backwards<00:02:34.680> and<00:02:35.450> I<00:02:38.299> would

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
just stroke backwards and I would

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:44.899 
just stroke backwards and I would
usually<00:02:39.450> do<00:02:39.810> I<00:02:42.560> don't<00:02:43.560> know<00:02:43.650> five<00:02:44.579> to<00:02:44.730> ten

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:44.909 
usually do I don't know five to ten

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:53.300 
usually do I don't know five to ten
swipes<00:02:45.209> on<00:02:45.450> one<00:02:45.629> side<00:02:49.310> and<00:02:50.310> then<00:02:51.980> five<00:02:52.980> to<00:02:53.129> ten

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
swipes on one side and then five to ten

00:02:53.310 --> 00:03:04.930 
swipes on one side and then five to ten
on<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:53.519> other<00:02:53.639> side<00:03:00.530> and<00:03:01.530> then

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.510 

I<00:03:05.000> would<00:03:05.690> do<00:03:05.810> that<00:03:05.960> back<00:03:06.770> and<00:03:06.950> forth<00:03:07.130> until<00:03:07.310> it

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
I would do that back and forth until it

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.510 
I would do that back and forth until it
was<00:03:07.610> sharpened

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.120 

the<00:03:12.940> things<00:03:13.210> I<00:03:13.330> like<00:03:13.540> about<00:03:13.570> the<00:03:14.140> scent<00:03:14.440> is<00:03:14.950> I

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
the things I like about the scent is I

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.760 
the things I like about the scent is I
like<00:03:15.340> that<00:03:15.520> it<00:03:15.670> has<00:03:15.850> four<00:03:16.480> different<00:03:17.200> stones

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:17.770 
like that it has four different stones

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.490 
like that it has four different stones
the<00:03:18.250> extra<00:03:18.580> course<00:03:18.850> and<00:03:19.150> the<00:03:19.900> course<00:03:20.170> I<00:03:20.410> mean

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
the extra course and the course I mean

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.950 
the extra course and the course I mean
they<00:03:20.620> really<00:03:21.010> take<00:03:21.250> off<00:03:21.550> the<00:03:21.970> material<00:03:22.120> really

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:22.960 
they really take off the material really

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:27.090 
they really take off the material really
fast<00:03:23.350> and<00:03:23.710> then<00:03:25.530> the<00:03:26.530> other<00:03:26.650> thing<00:03:26.890> that<00:03:26.920> I

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
fast and then the other thing that I

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.350 
fast and then the other thing that I
like<00:03:28.740> see<00:03:29.740> if<00:03:29.830> I<00:03:29.890> get<00:03:29.950> it<00:03:30.160> where<00:03:30.340> you<00:03:30.370> see<00:03:30.550> it<00:03:30.880> is

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
like see if I get it where you see it is

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.400 
like see if I get it where you see it is
I<00:03:31.540> really<00:03:31.750> like<00:03:31.930> that<00:03:32.050> you<00:03:32.170> have<00:03:32.290> the

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
I really like that you have the

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.880 
I really like that you have the
selectable<00:03:32.890> angles<00:03:33.370> so<00:03:33.670> you<00:03:33.700> can<00:03:34.000> put<00:03:34.240> the

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
selectable angles so you can put the

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.150 
selectable angles so you can put the
sharpness<00:03:35.890> that<00:03:37.020> you<00:03:38.020> want<00:03:38.350> to<00:03:38.740> that<00:03:38.890> kind<00:03:39.130> of

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
sharpness that you want to that kind of

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.160 
sharpness that you want to that kind of
a<00:03:39.280> blade<00:03:39.550> I<00:03:39.580> mean<00:03:39.880> you<00:03:40.030> can<00:03:40.180> change<00:03:40.450> it<00:03:40.600> for<00:03:41.110> a

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
a blade I mean you can change it for a

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.780 
a blade I mean you can change it for a
regular<00:03:41.320> pocketknife<00:03:42.010> or<00:03:42.280> if<00:03:42.400> you're<00:03:42.550> trying

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
regular pocketknife or if you're trying

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.210 
regular pocketknife or if you're trying
to<00:03:42.940> sharpen<00:03:43.230> say<00:03:44.230> a<00:03:44.260> fillet<00:03:44.590> knife<00:03:44.830> that<00:03:45.040> needs

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
to sharpen say a fillet knife that needs

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.090 
to sharpen say a fillet knife that needs
to<00:03:45.340> be<00:03:45.430> extra<00:03:45.790> sharp<00:03:46.230> the<00:03:47.230> clamp<00:03:47.470> myself<00:03:47.890> I

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
to be extra sharp the clamp myself I

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.360 
to be extra sharp the clamp myself I
don't<00:03:48.160> really<00:03:48.460> like<00:03:48.670> I<00:03:48.960> don't<00:03:49.960> like<00:03:50.190> the<00:03:51.190> very

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
don't really like I don't like the very

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.140 
don't really like I don't like the very
small<00:03:52.500> clamping<00:03:53.500> area<00:03:53.800> notched<00:03:54.400> into<00:03:54.730> the<00:03:54.940> top

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
small clamping area notched into the top

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.680 
small clamping area notched into the top
I<00:03:56.080> don't<00:03:56.650> like<00:03:56.830> that<00:03:57.040> it's<00:03:57.220> hard<00:03:57.430> to<00:03:57.520> get<00:03:58.300> it<00:03:58.450> to

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
I don't like that it's hard to get it to

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.830 
I don't like that it's hard to get it to
clamp<00:03:59.410> tightly<00:03:59.980> enough<00:04:00.250> to<00:04:00.460> for<00:04:00.970> the<00:04:01.090> blade

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
clamp tightly enough to for the blade

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.610 
clamp tightly enough to for the blade
not<00:04:02.560> to<00:04:02.710> fall<00:04:02.920> out<00:04:03.160> I<00:04:03.930> also<00:04:04.930> don't<00:04:05.260> think<00:04:05.410> that

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
not to fall out I also don't think that

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.370 
not to fall out I also don't think that
the<00:04:05.830> clamp<00:04:06.400> is<00:04:06.550> long<00:04:06.790> enough<00:04:07.110> just<00:04:08.110> by<00:04:08.320> the

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
the clamp is long enough just by the

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.240 
the clamp is long enough just by the
time<00:04:08.770> I<00:04:09.450> put<00:04:10.450> this<00:04:10.630> in<00:04:10.900> here<00:04:11.170> and<00:04:11.320> I<00:04:11.740> stroke

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
time I put this in here and I stroke

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:13.440 
time I put this in here and I stroke
down<00:04:12.640> all<00:04:12.940> the<00:04:13.060> way

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
down all the way

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.360 
down all the way
see<00:04:14.200> it's<00:04:14.350> sitting<00:04:14.620> at<00:04:14.680> the<00:04:14.770> bottom<00:04:14.950> and<00:04:15.250> you

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
see it's sitting at the bottom and you

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.039 
see it's sitting at the bottom and you
can<00:04:15.460> tell<00:04:15.580> I<00:04:15.610> got<00:04:15.790> an<00:04:15.970> extra<00:04:16.330> inch<00:04:16.510> of<00:04:16.690> stone<00:04:16.900> I

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
can tell I got an extra inch of stone I

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:19.100 
can tell I got an extra inch of stone I
don't<00:04:17.080> get<00:04:17.410> to<00:04:17.530> use<00:04:17.770> this<00:04:18.430> full<00:04:18.760> stone

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:19.110 
don't get to use this full stone

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:21.990 
don't get to use this full stone
definitely<00:04:20.110> needs<00:04:20.320> to<00:04:20.500> be<00:04:20.590> a<00:04:20.620> taller<00:04:20.950> clamp<00:04:21.370> so

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
definitely needs to be a taller clamp so

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.820 
definitely needs to be a taller clamp so
you<00:04:22.090> can<00:04:22.300> use<00:04:22.570> the<00:04:22.750> full<00:04:23.020> stroke<00:04:23.290> to<00:04:23.470> the<00:04:23.500> stone

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
you can use the full stroke to the stone

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.790 
you can use the full stroke to the stone
and<00:04:24.100> not<00:04:24.730> hit<00:04:25.120> the<00:04:25.270> bottom<00:04:25.630> which<00:04:25.900> actually

and not hit the bottom which actually

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.220 
and not hit the bottom which actually
helps<00:04:27.490> knock<00:04:27.820> the<00:04:28.180> knife<00:04:28.210> out<00:04:28.690> of<00:04:28.780> the<00:04:28.960> clamp

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
helps knock the knife out of the clamp

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.350 
helps knock the knife out of the clamp
because<00:04:29.590> they're<00:04:29.740> smacking<00:04:30.310> down<00:04:30.430> here<00:04:30.730> and

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
because they're smacking down here and

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:37.280 
because they're smacking down here and
you're<00:04:31.480> banging<00:04:32.610> the<00:04:34.410> clamp<00:04:35.410> off<00:04:35.740> the<00:04:35.800> knife

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
you're banging the clamp off the knife

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:41.130 
you're banging the clamp off the knife
but<00:04:38.700> other<00:04:39.700> than<00:04:39.880> those<00:04:40.030> fuse<00:04:40.390> dislikes<00:04:40.900> which

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.140 
but other than those fuse dislikes which

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.030 
but other than those fuse dislikes which
is<00:04:41.260> mostly<00:04:41.650> in<00:04:41.740> the<00:04:41.830> clamp<00:04:43.470> it's<00:04:44.470> a<00:04:44.650> pretty

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
is mostly in the clamp it's a pretty

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.430 
is mostly in the clamp it's a pretty
handy<00:04:45.400> little<00:04:45.550> system<00:04:46.030> but<00:04:46.930> for<00:04:47.110> the<00:04:47.170> price<00:04:47.380> of

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
handy little system but for the price of

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.920 
handy little system but for the price of
the<00:04:47.680> system<00:04:48.100> I<00:04:50.040> honestly<00:04:51.600> don't<00:04:52.600> know<00:04:52.720> if<00:04:52.780> I

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
the system I honestly don't know if I

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.320 
the system I honestly don't know if I
should<00:04:53.140> have<00:04:53.730> went<00:04:54.730> and<00:04:54.850> got<00:04:54.940> something

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
should have went and got something

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.590 
should have went and got something
different<00:04:55.720> but<00:04:57.210> definitely<00:04:58.210> nice<00:04:58.360> because

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:58.600 
different but definitely nice because

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.820 
different but definitely nice because
it's<00:04:58.780> one<00:04:58.900> of<00:04:58.960> the<00:04:59.080> few<00:04:59.170> systems<00:04:59.410> where<00:04:59.800> you

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
it's one of the few systems where you

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.620 
it's one of the few systems where you
can<00:05:00.040> select<00:05:00.960> your<00:05:01.960> angles<00:05:03.150> so<00:05:04.150> right<00:05:04.330> now<00:05:04.480> this

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
can select your angles so right now this

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.020 
can select your angles so right now this
is<00:05:04.810> what<00:05:04.960> I'm<00:05:05.110> using<00:05:05.350> to<00:05:06.160> sharpen<00:05:06.670> my<00:05:06.820> knives

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
is what I'm using to sharpen my knives
