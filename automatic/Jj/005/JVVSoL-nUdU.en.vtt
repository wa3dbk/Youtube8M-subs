00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.539 

my<00:01:24.060> guess<00:01:24.329> would<00:01:24.540> be<00:01:25.009> then<00:01:26.009> heated<00:01:26.369> in<00:01:26.520> the

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
my guess would be then heated in the

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.620 
my guess would be then heated in the
amateur<00:01:27.170> 397<00:01:28.170> fights<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:28.829> lost<00:01:29.040> one<00:01:29.369> so<00:01:30.360> my

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
amateur 397 fights and lost one so my

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.499 
amateur 397 fights and lost one so my
guess<00:01:30.689> would<00:01:31.110> be<00:01:31.170> in<00:01:32.040> a<00:01:32.189> professional<00:01:32.909> he

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
guess would be in a professional he

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.300 
guess would be in a professional he
already<00:01:33.659> did<00:01:33.899> lost<00:01:34.290> at<00:01:34.500> one<00:01:34.710> side<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.220> that's
