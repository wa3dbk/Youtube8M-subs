00:00:09.739 --> 00:00:13.099
 and we go to San Mamés an interesting match was planned 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:16.409
 with alternatives for the two teams 

00:00:16.409 --> 00:00:20.649
 well the foot had more than three points at stake because remember that the last 

00:00:20.649 --> 00:00:22.989
 session and it was already in this stadium 

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:25.989
 was the semifinal of the last cup of the king according to 3 0 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.339
 overwhelmed 

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:33.420
 but this time I did not have no mercy on the seville of the athletic was ahead in the 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.370
 minute 4 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.200
 by means of renato 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.770
 he did not have his best afternoon 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.770
 efe gorka iráizoz before being and already 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:43.220
 it came to him 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.220
 that first goal of renato 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.019
 there we see that 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:48.230
 the porter reacts late 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.670
 and finished off spur that was missing by the short stick 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.610
 Quijano was missing 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:54.830
 one more man 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.870
 in the barrier opportunity now for the athletic touch fight the ball 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.240
 the face but rejects palop after fernando llorente the one who tries 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.240
 returns to catch the Sevilla goalkeeper 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.850
 in the 20th minute practice that definitely broke the match after that 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.039
 punt de amorebieta capel takes the ball but very well to negredo 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.010
 which marks the tossal the zero to two 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.010
 second goal for the sevillistas 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.330
 all doing merits for 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.050
 in the sevillista front since it is very clear because we do not forget all 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.700
 the gunpowder that has manolo jiménez 12 disposition by negredo with kanouté 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.820
 by Luis Fabiano 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.820
 of ledger the sevillista technician 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.970
 reserve face players 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.960
 to the champions game that is going to play this week 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.730
 seville can not you will enjoy 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.370
 in gol television 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.510
 on Tuesday at a quarter to nine from Glasgow 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.930
 the two lines seville the second day of the league of champions this is a 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.520
 occasion of Gurpegui 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.710
 you have to take advantage of a punt punt but the ball goes over the 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:03.460
 crossbar 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.850
 on the next play 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.549
 franco de negredo 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:10.429
 what is required 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.429
 to pick up the rejection of kira and zoos 

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:20.069
 very passive 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.369
 abal the defense of the athletic in this type of occasions that 

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:26.199
 very clear balls to advance lateros of sevilla 

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:30.369
 he tried again fernando llorente shoots from afar he rejects palop 

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:33.139
 then I touch acrobatically 

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:34.279
 try to mark 

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:36.179
 the goal of his life 

00:02:36.179 --> 00:02:39.179
 that shot him very high 

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:51.149
 play and opportunity for seville the man go to negredo notice that 

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:53.949
 shot the crossbar 

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:57.369
 he takes out with the left leg the forward of sevilla spectacular the 

00:02:57.369 --> 00:02:59.439
 body twist 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:02.509
 to splice that ball 

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:05.509
 It is not impressive because he also had his back to the goal 

00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:09.919
 but calculate the distance and that impressive volley is pulled 

00:03:11.999 --> 00:03:14.999
 in the 46th minute in the discount of the first part 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:19.379
 the third goal of Seville practically sentenced the game 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:21.849
 frederic kanouté 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:23.859
 bad irrazoz clearance 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:25.529
 llorente arrives late 

00:03:25.529 --> 00:03:27.129
 spicy takes advantage 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:31.349
 third goal for Seville and a fact that is the 'black beast' of the aleti seven 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:32.439
 goals in seven games 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:33.899
 they have marked him 

00:03:33.899 --> 00:03:36.899
 to the lions the forward of sevilla 

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:46.529
 with that result s 

00:03:46.529 --> 00:03:49.529
 3 to 0 in favor of Sevilla was going to arrive at the break 

00:03:50.249 --> 00:03:54.119
 and I still enjoyed soccer in San Mamés and the good atmosphere later 

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:59.339
 in the Biscayan capital 

00:04:01.279 --> 00:04:03.079
 minute 9 of the second part 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:06.559
 Amorebieta will leave his team with ten men will close the second 

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:09.819
 yellow 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:13.099
 lack on sergio sanchez 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:16.099
 the referee 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:20.199
 and he alone died if he already had it complicated 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:22.109
 with that result 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:24.930
 one man less for that 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.050
 amorebieta 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.629
 it was practically impossible to 

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:30.120
 I worked and elbowed clear 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.430
 like therefore the expulsion of amorebieta with those holes in the defense 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.080
 the seville continued to take advantage 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.729
 with his punch and jesus navas 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:45.810
 in the 74th minute they scored 0 to 4 

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:49.989
 has reacted well the seville that lost in the first day in 

00:04:49.989 --> 00:04:52.539
 mestalla but since then in its wake 

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:56.409
 three by three is the alternative to bipolarity that mark Barcelona and 

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:57.659
 madrid at the top of the ranking
