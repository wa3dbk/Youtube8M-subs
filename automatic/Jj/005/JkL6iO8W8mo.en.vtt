00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
thicker because they have a lot of zinc

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.240 
thicker because they have a lot of zinc
oxide<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:45.990> titanium<00:01:46.020> dioxide<00:01:46.649> the

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
oxide and titanium dioxide the

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.219 
oxide and titanium dioxide the
sunscreens<00:01:47.729> physical<00:01:48.210> sunscreens<00:01:48.360> that's

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
sunscreens physical sunscreens that's

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.139 
sunscreens physical sunscreens that's
why<00:01:49.409> they<00:01:49.560> had<00:01:49.710> that<00:01:49.860> thick<00:01:50.130> field<00:01:50.430> plus<00:01:50.880> they

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
why they had that thick field plus they

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.539 
why they had that thick field plus they
have<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.630> lot<00:01:52.290> of<00:01:52.320> silicone<00:01:52.799> we<00:01:53.100> look<00:01:53.369> at<00:01:53.490> the

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
have a lot of silicone we look at the

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.789 
have a lot of silicone we look at the
ingredients<00:01:53.700> in<00:01:54.299> many<00:01:55.079> of<00:01:55.320> them<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.590> first

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
ingredients in many of them the first

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.440 
ingredients in many of them the first
ingredient<00:01:56.070> or<00:01:56.549> second<00:01:56.850> ingredient<00:01:57.329> is

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
ingredient or second ingredient is

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.090 
ingredient or second ingredient is
silicone<00:01:57.930> so<00:01:58.380> if<00:01:58.500> you<00:01:58.619> or<00:01:58.770> somebody<00:01:58.950> who

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
silicone so if you or somebody who

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.499 
silicone so if you or somebody who
doesn't<00:01:59.280> like<00:01:59.430> silicones<00:01:59.880> you're<00:02:00.180> not<00:02:00.390> going

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
doesn't like silicones you're not going

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.389 
doesn't like silicones you're not going
to<00:02:00.570> like<00:02:00.689> BB<00:02:00.960> creams<00:02:01.229> but<00:02:01.799> i<00:02:01.860> think<00:02:02.280> the

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
to like BB creams but i think the

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.580 
to like BB creams but i think the
silicone<00:02:02.790> is<00:02:02.939> why<00:02:03.119> so<00:02:03.390> many<00:02:03.540> people<00:02:03.630> like<00:02:04.350> the

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
silicone is why so many people like the

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.679 
silicone is why so many people like the
way<00:02:04.710> they<00:02:04.860> feel<00:02:05.100> silicone<00:02:05.700> is<00:02:05.729> used<00:02:06.180> in<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:06.540> lot

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
way they feel silicone is used in a lot

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.900 
way they feel silicone is used in a lot
of<00:02:06.750> makeup<00:02:07.200> primers<00:02:07.829> so<00:02:08.399> you<00:02:08.459> could<00:02:08.670> even<00:02:08.759> say

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
of makeup primers so you could even say

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.520 
of makeup primers so you could even say
that<00:02:09.209> there's<00:02:09.360> makeup<00:02:09.569> primer<00:02:09.840> in<00:02:10.140> here<00:02:10.349> as

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
that there's makeup primer in here as

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.050 
that there's makeup primer in here as
well<00:02:10.709> so<00:02:10.770> it's<00:02:11.039> a<00:02:11.069> combination<00:02:11.310> of<00:02:11.730> all<00:02:11.849> these

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
well so it's a combination of all these

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.970 
well so it's a combination of all these
things

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
things

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.420 
things
as<00:02:13.310> far<00:02:14.060> as<00:02:14.090> being<00:02:14.780> an<00:02:15.019> all-in-one<00:02:15.530> treatment

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
as far as being an all-in-one treatment

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.460 
as far as being an all-in-one treatment
for<00:02:16.610> the<00:02:16.700> skin<00:02:16.970> as<00:02:17.299> well<00:02:17.629> as<00:02:17.900> makeup

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
for the skin as well as makeup

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.630 
for the skin as well as makeup
foundation<00:02:19.239> my<00:02:20.239> opinion<00:02:20.870> on<00:02:20.989> that<00:02:21.140> is<00:02:21.440> I<00:02:21.950> would

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
foundation my opinion on that is I would

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.729 
foundation my opinion on that is I would
not<00:02:23.060> use<00:02:23.360> this<00:02:23.780> in<00:02:24.049> place<00:02:24.290> of<00:02:24.319> all<00:02:24.620> your

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
not use this in place of all your

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.449 
not use this in place of all your
treatments<00:02:25.220> because<00:02:25.540> we<00:02:26.540> know<00:02:26.810> that<00:02:26.840> that<00:02:27.560> the

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
treatments because we know that that the

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.479 
treatments because we know that that the
most<00:02:28.670> difficult<00:02:29.150> thing<00:02:29.390> that<00:02:29.629> skincare

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
most difficult thing that skincare

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.070 
most difficult thing that skincare
companies<00:02:31.489> have<00:02:31.700> to<00:02:31.849> do<00:02:32.030> is<00:02:32.239> figure<00:02:32.510> out<00:02:32.690> a<00:02:32.810> way

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
companies have to do is figure out a way

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.259 
companies have to do is figure out a way
to<00:02:33.650> get<00:02:33.799> the<00:02:33.980> active<00:02:34.459> ingredients<00:02:35.150> to

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
to get the active ingredients to

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:37.089 
to get the active ingredients to
penetrate<00:02:35.450> I've<00:02:35.989> talked<00:02:36.260> about<00:02:36.500> this<00:02:36.680> a<00:02:36.739> lot

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099 
penetrate I've talked about this a lot

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:41.080 
penetrate I've talked about this a lot
our<00:02:37.910> skins<00:02:38.420> job<00:02:38.870> is<00:02:39.110> to<00:02:39.230> keep<00:02:39.440> things<00:02:39.739> out<00:02:40.090> so

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
our skins job is to keep things out so

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.880 
our skins job is to keep things out so
like<00:02:41.329> when<00:02:41.420> I<00:02:41.480> talk<00:02:41.540> about<00:02:41.870> the<00:02:41.959> osmosis<00:02:42.440> line

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
like when I talk about the osmosis line

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.250 
like when I talk about the osmosis line
the<00:02:43.129> reason<00:02:43.489> I<00:02:43.549> love<00:02:43.760> it<00:02:43.879> so<00:02:43.909> much<00:02:44.090> is<00:02:44.480> they<00:02:44.989> use

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
the reason I love it so much is they use

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.470 
the reason I love it so much is they use
an<00:02:45.560> enzyme<00:02:45.799> called<00:02:46.150> phosphatidyl<00:02:47.150> show<00:02:47.360> up

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
an enzyme called phosphatidyl show up

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.140 
an enzyme called phosphatidyl show up
chilling<00:02:47.930> and<00:02:48.110> it<00:02:48.739> envelopes<00:02:49.459> around<00:02:49.849> the

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
chilling and it envelopes around the

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.880 
chilling and it envelopes around the
active<00:02:50.540> ingredients<00:02:51.170> and<00:02:51.319> it<00:02:51.530> increases

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
active ingredients and it increases

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.270 
active ingredients and it increases
pentateuch<00:02:52.489> penetration<00:02:53.209> by<00:02:53.959> they<00:02:54.349> quote<00:02:55.250> a

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
pentateuch penetration by they quote a

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.830 
pentateuch penetration by they quote a
huge<00:02:55.670> percentage<00:02:55.879> I<00:02:56.329> don't<00:02:56.540> know<00:02:56.629> if<00:02:56.690> that's

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
huge percentage I don't know if that's

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.330 
huge percentage I don't know if that's
true<00:02:56.930> but<00:02:57.290> it's<00:02:58.069> the<00:02:58.280> same<00:03:00.069> lip<00:03:01.069> is<00:03:01.220> ohm

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
true but it's the same lip is ohm

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.780 
true but it's the same lip is ohm
actually<00:03:01.700> that's<00:03:01.879> used<00:03:02.209> in<00:03:02.569> medical<00:03:03.790> patches

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
actually that's used in medical patches

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.240 
actually that's used in medical patches
you<00:03:05.359> know<00:03:05.470> like<00:03:06.470> the<00:03:06.590> one<00:03:06.739> for<00:03:07.040> birth<00:03:07.220> control

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
you know like the one for birth control

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.809 
you know like the one for birth control
and<00:03:08.090> maybe<00:03:08.269> the<00:03:08.420> one<00:03:08.569> for<00:03:08.900> hormones<00:03:09.739> so<00:03:10.310> we

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
and maybe the one for hormones so we

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:12.009 
and maybe the one for hormones so we
know<00:03:11.030> that<00:03:11.060> this<00:03:11.420> helps<00:03:11.870> increase

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
know that this helps increase

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:14.559 
know that this helps increase
penetration<00:03:12.829> with<00:03:13.489> something<00:03:13.849> like<00:03:14.000> these<00:03:14.209> BB

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:14.569 
penetration with something like these BB

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:16.420 
penetration with something like these BB
creams<00:03:15.019> and<00:03:15.379> these<00:03:15.799> are<00:03:15.950> the<00:03:16.010> three<00:03:16.250> that<00:03:16.370> I

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
creams and these are the three that I

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.750 
creams and these are the three that I
got<00:03:17.590> the<00:03:18.590> formulation<00:03:19.310> first<00:03:19.519> of<00:03:19.579> all<00:03:19.639> when

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
got the formulation first of all when

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.550 
got the formulation first of all when
you've<00:03:19.849> got<00:03:19.940> zinc<00:03:20.269> oxide<00:03:20.660> and<00:03:21.019> titanium

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
you've got zinc oxide and titanium

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.059 
you've got zinc oxide and titanium
dioxide<00:03:22.190> mixed<00:03:23.030> in<00:03:23.180> this<00:03:23.810> can't<00:03:24.380> possibly<00:03:24.470> be

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:25.069 
dioxide mixed in this can't possibly be

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:27.360 
dioxide mixed in this can't possibly be
penetrating<00:03:25.910> to<00:03:26.120> the<00:03:26.209> dermis<00:03:26.630> to<00:03:26.810> do<00:03:26.959> anything

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
penetrating to the dermis to do anything

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.120 
penetrating to the dermis to do anything
so<00:03:28.370> i<00:03:28.639> would<00:03:28.910> say<00:03:29.120> use<00:03:29.630> it<00:03:29.870> if<00:03:29.959> you<00:03:29.989> like<00:03:30.410> the

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
so i would say use it if you like the

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.670 
so i would say use it if you like the
consistency<00:03:31.940> if<00:03:32.540> you<00:03:32.660> like<00:03:32.810> the<00:03:32.959> feel<00:03:33.230> if<00:03:33.590> you

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
consistency if you like the feel if you

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.500 
consistency if you like the feel if you
like<00:03:33.859> the<00:03:34.010> coverage<00:03:34.400> you<00:03:34.519> get<00:03:34.700> and<00:03:34.970> if<00:03:35.359> you're

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510
