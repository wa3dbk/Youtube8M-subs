00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.880
 [Music] 

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:11.640
 and well let's see Quique's quote and 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:14.850
 brenda to see what happens if you're clear 

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:17.430
 the toast 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:21.300
 because today we are in the yard 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.520
 from my house prepare well this for 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.900
 that we have a drink that we talk and 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.210
 good if you want to get in to see that we 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.770
 I can go in for a while and keep talking 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.240
 perfect the truth was a very 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.860
 pretty because it's the first one I 've 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.020
 had with him is a date that had 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.730
 waited for quite some time and that I already 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.350
 we had gone to a wedding like you 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.000
 you know but we had never had a 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:44.489
 as intimate as the appointment today 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.500
 principle nothing is nothing but you fall very 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.780
 well it's a very good person I'm worried about 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.460
 little because it started me like asking 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.860
 and very serious things as you think 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:58.850
 this can work if you are in the 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.850
 df and I'm here like that 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.780
 Well, happy about life, I think we're going 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.280
 On the right track we can move forward 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.440
 with our relationship 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.100
 again go over apply to work and 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.980
 Take the time to promise me that 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.100
 everything you tell me and what you told me 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:19.360
 I always follow with all the truth 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.360
 and never again to lie 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.540
 and I promised his sincere look that 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:36.220
 everything I said is true 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:37.960
 [Music] 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.780
 then just more fun in what it is 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.900
 the water in the pool were playing 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.270
 For a while I had a lot of fun and the truth is 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:50.910
 I love to use it and spend time 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.910
 with her it's amazing 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:02:00.030
 [Music] 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.040
 I feel excited because I already know 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.690
 wants to go one step further and the truth 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.450
 [Music] 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:10.849
 [Applause] 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.849
 the toast I present 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.220
 I think 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.250
 images are worth a thousand words 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:22.400
 quick rating I'm impacted this 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:25.540
 rice is already cooked heart corazoncito 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.540
 so i qualify you 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:34.000
 where the first time he has been and that 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.880
 really very affective with a girl 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.700
 and one of the girls and has continued on 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.470
 the same situation that they have known and 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.080
 the commitment something that I love you 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.600
 saying rule is the first time he does 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.450
 this and I tell you to be always honest 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:53.200
 that you were always clear 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:55.840
 is the important good I hope and that you're 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.379
 at the height of the heart goal for that 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.379
 route 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.730
 cash 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.640
 how was the movies of the 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:11.060
 Wednesday very well if it was the cinema 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.060
 true yes, of course, a friend and a friend 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:20.790
 Intense report from friends 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.920
 friends and allow that from friends 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:26.640
 because I tell you that if you're really 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:30.650
 very excited as loved with her but 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.650
 to go to the movies with friends 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:37.740
 hot 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:40.170
 that the things that go away 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:42.840
 with a friend 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.120
 It is very easy, of course, that everything depends on 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.099
 how things get if you go with a friend 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.530
 a friend and they alone because if I 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:50.920
 does a lack of respect but good 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.650
 she 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:56.050
 and goes for a couple of friends and she 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.640
 accompanied the film the situation saw an 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.260
 little differently and effectively if I 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.730
 I had said before that for me that counts 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.260
 much that they tell you the truth that I 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.880
 tell me before if I had 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:07.610
 seemed like a problem and the truth is that 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:09.590
 I do not think you do not go today I go with you 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:12.040
 understand the images of that but if 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.040
 apparatus 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:17.050
 and I think it would be a bit later 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:20.530
 different in relation to what I said does 

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:22.450
 a moment person does not depend on buying in 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.920
 person if you go alone with a guy 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:26.530
 system is a lack of respect but if 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.450
 You go with a partner and she is a friend and 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.100
 know I do not see any big problem 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.930
 I say personally 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:35.050
 the friendship between a man and a woman 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:37.600
 it is a clear key love driving and 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:40.320
 then clear clear clear clear is 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.320
 totally different 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.000
 your problem
