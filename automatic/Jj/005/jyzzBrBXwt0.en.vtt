 today I find you for a 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.150
 new video tutorial on the tool 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.700
 ghost to know how to have the word geek 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.710
 without before upload the death to the log 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.910
 so for those who do not know what 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.580
 what is the maverick I'm going to 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.720
 explain briefly so Morocco is 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.210
 a hormone what we have in 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.880
 downloading the brush pack that 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.800
 first dlc of call of duty got so to 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.109
 know that you will have two versions of the 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.970
 husband who do not have one to know a 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.740
 philizot version a senators version 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.410
 so to do this you just need 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.660
 to go partly private configuration 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.600
 party in options you changed 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.370
 october party team and game so 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.829
 we left you go all 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.030
 put in unlimited option and that made 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.070
 put him their radars always active 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.850
 on wii this game you will put 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.550
 equipment restrictions with 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.750
 personal equipment restriction you 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.719
 go restrict everything that is 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.210
 secondary main and accessory therefore 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.980
 for the boks you can put as much 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.299
 you want me I'm going to put 4 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.670
 easier and difficulty in recruits 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:11.010
 I restart the game 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.140
 so I want to tell you that I do not know 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.780
 not yet if I come before the pac who 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.360
 if I can get it if it's frozen 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.820
 by chance I will make you a video 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.580
 discovery on each map namely a 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.460
 video for each map namely phone bay 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.130
 view containment and initions the initiator 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.260
 that stowed that scrapyard of 2 mw 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.590
 2 so 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:39.030
 jean-guy to play it and also I 'll tell you 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:43.680
 do one on you will make it a passion 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.370
 on the episode speaking of the fashion 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.250
 extraction 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:49.500
 but it must be said that if better if 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.230
 you have the season pass or that I had 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.330
 bought the pack passed the least for 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.490
 to be able to make the video of simply and 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.990
 to be able to play and be able to do 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.130
 videos with you especially so here 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.810
 for the class if you wish to have 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.250
 the knife as another meaning or so 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.479
 did you restrict everything 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.890
 which is all that is at a centex is 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.890
 wanted everything that died and the 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:17.430
 tactics so to have him there you 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.960
 Just kill a bot the first boots 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:26.910
 do not let go it's the second one who 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:29.100
 loose or the third it depends so there 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:32.430
 we have the sniper version the maverick to 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:35.610
 two with a magnificent bright viewfinder 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:42.090
 hybrid forgiveness a little futuristic you 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:46.680
 see a v12 it did not see 12v 1.223 case 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:50.720
 marchetti i want you his game you 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:54.390
 also show the assault rifles version 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:57.060
 so I do not know why but the 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.890
 sniper version is more difficult to see 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.470
 than the version that version 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.840
 assault rifles and this is the version 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:08.260
 assault rifles that easier to have 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.810
 that the physical opponent at his game 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.890
 that I am fed up in the sentence 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.840
 it's the finished version of assault 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:18.520
 normally which is easier to see 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:23.380
 that version sneijder so I tried 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:32.830
 to see her to show you but at 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:38.380
 nose come the little ones here is still a 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:40.830
 little bit forgotten to camp I think 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.450
 they will not let go 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.700
 if I have a little if I have a little luck 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.100
 so you see the damage that the 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:54.489
 senator does so if you are adept 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:56.230
 equipped with this sniper there you have 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:59.200
 is likely to make 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:01.300
 good series so to know that the 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.190
 markers are present anyway she 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.370
 sees the shock not all the time and for 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:09.700
 those who are followers of the neck series 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:12.010
 neck to the eliminations the rifle version 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:15.730
 assault of the mavericks is not and not bad 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:18.760
 to make series to know if you 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.650
 put you put the balls accessory 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.140
 piercing 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:27.640
 it's lying to you, it increases the damage 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:30.190
 and penetration already that without 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:33.090
 accessory it hurts so if you 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:35.440
 add the perforating bullets 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.970
 I can not imagine because there I have not 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.270
 better the first props so I 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:45.570
 can not tell you I think they'll 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:45.570
 not let go of the cites is him 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:57.150
 so we'll do a v6 at the neck at 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:59.400
 terminal in millau i want to tell you 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.930
 that I can shoot longer so 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.480
