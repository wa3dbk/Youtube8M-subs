00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.010
 chile finally won the first cup 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.139
 America in its history after beating 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.299
 Argentina's favorite was a match 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.519
 exciting in the national stadium of 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:15.509
 santiago that was defined in the round of 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.730
 penalties 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.160
 the albiceleste aspired to conquer the 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.880
 that would have been his cup number 15 but 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.370
 it could not be 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:28.250
 the red imposed his domain of host 

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:30.860
 and to know is in our study 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.450
 leandro fest our expert partner 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.610
 in sports thanks leandro fes by 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.530
 being with you were following this 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.690
 match because you're interested in football 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.180
 also because you are Argentine that we 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.190
 You can finally comment on the role of 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.320
 the red good as they say in these 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.570
 cases in the soccer jargon the match 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.510
 really the party and I was for 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.550
 either penalty shootout was more 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.700
 deserved that never and I say I was 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.980
 for anyone because so much for the 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.690
 soccer the suffocating football that presented 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.760
 more than all along the entire cup 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:05.620
 not concretely today yes by passages 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.620
 chiles and why Argentina 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.490
 at times he also made his talent 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.920
 individual became a football 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.650
 exquisite was not the case as I say of the 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.670
 final for both teams but 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.980
 anyone who had won until the 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.650
 end you would have deserved but that's not 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:24.830
 removes that chile has won very 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:27.200
 deservedly this final is a job 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.240
 who has been coming for eight years started in 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.950
 that moment with marcelo bielsa who 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.970
 Well, by the way, it's Argentine 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.650
 he also had with 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.740
 also with another Argentine technician 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.840
 sampaoli but without Chilean players with 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.550
 the claw they have because they have such 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.040
 less individual talent but without the 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.380
 Chilean claw does not exist either technically 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.360
 Argentine who is worth that chile won 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.000
 deservedly argentina will have to 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.340
 expect to wait maybe until russia 2018 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.640
 if it is played in the kingdom of putin 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.230
 the next world cup that will be to see 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.300
 that's another topic that we're not going to touch 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:01.790
 now so tell you can you make a 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.790
 balance of the ups and downs that had 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.410
 this cup america chile 2015 good in 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.810
 principle one thing that always I 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:11.380
 I discussed with many colleagues the subject of 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:15.290
 that there are two teams in advance and that 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:18.170
 three the two best third classify 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.300
 for the quarter-finals does not 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.130
 deduce so much this america cup 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.310
 I think so for the next cup 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.959
 america was proposed in 16 teams 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.930
 series would be a tournament in less speculates 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:32.180
 of more competitive speculative and 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.960
 surely more attractive to 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.240
 spectators 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:39.840
 another topic down specifically this cup 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.580
 america was the subject of the brusque game that 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.400
 it was very allowed by the referees 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.560
 it was even known by some microphones 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.260
 to abound an umpire in a match that 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.840
 said an Argentine player this is 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.210
 america and so it's played and it's a pity 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.270
 because it's been decades since 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:59.100
 exports South American talent to Europe and 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.320
 in an opportunity as beautiful as is the 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:05.190
 america cup to gather all that 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:07.410
 talent and see it instead of that it gets bleary 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.270
 somehow leandro other elections 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.980
 that also shone in this cup 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.440
 America beyond Argentina or Chile 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.510
 well I would highlight two things for 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.610
 one good and another bad one would highlight what 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.780
 of Peru that repeats third place e 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.180
 even that the same statistics 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.420
 Argentina statistics of 2011 when 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:27.300
 that game the previous america cup 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:30.330
 but he does not win he does not play a world cup ever 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.520
 won world since 1982 games only 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.560
 in four global opportunities but 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.989
 if he continues like this he has possibilities brazil 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.870
 is the dependent account that Brazil does not 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:42.000
 manages to produce a team 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.660
 solid that's the other negative note 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.660
 we would say 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:48.709
 thank you very much leandro fes for all your 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.709
 appreciations here
