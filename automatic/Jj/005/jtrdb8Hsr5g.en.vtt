inch<00:02:27.410> drill<00:02:27.709> bits<00:02:27.950> in<00:02:28.160> there<00:02:28.340> it's<00:02:28.519> like

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
inch drill bits in there it's like

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:38.680

absolutely<00:02:29.440> huge<00:02:30.440> huge<00:02:31.130> air<00:02:31.370> hole<00:02:31.610> I<00:02:37.690> have

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
absolutely huge huge air hole I have

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.539 
absolutely huge huge air hole I have
more<00:02:38.930> juice<00:02:40.120> and<00:02:41.120> this<00:02:41.299> thing<00:02:41.690> is<00:02:42.319> I<00:02:42.590> really

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:43.549 
more juice and this thing is I really

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:47.020 
more juice and this thing is I really
had<00:02:43.670> thought<00:02:44.769> anything<00:02:45.769> bigger<00:02:46.220> than<00:02:46.340> 24

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
had thought anything bigger than 24

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.110 
had thought anything bigger than 24
gauge<00:02:47.330> it<00:02:47.510> was<00:02:47.600> just<00:02:47.840> not<00:02:48.110> going<00:02:48.350> to<00:02:48.410> work<00:02:48.620> with

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
gauge it was just not going to work with

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.390 
gauge it was just not going to work with
whether<00:02:50.120> you're<00:02:50.540> a<00:02:50.569> single<00:02:50.810> battery<00:02:51.170> or<00:02:51.650> 18

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
whether you're a single battery or 18

650<00:02:53.319> I've<00:02:54.319> been<00:02:54.530> playing<00:02:54.799> with<00:02:54.920> the<00:02:55.040> 26<00:02:55.690> 652

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
650 I've been playing with the 26 652

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.509 
650 I've been playing with the 26 652
right<00:02:58.640> now<00:02:58.850> I<00:02:58.880> think<00:02:59.180> the<00:02:59.630> sony<00:03:00.500> 50<00:03:01.010> amp<00:03:01.190> is<00:03:01.400> the

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
right now I think the sony 50 amp is the

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:04.300 
right now I think the sony 50 amp is the
best<00:03:01.730> battery<00:03:02.030> out<00:03:02.269> there<00:03:02.720> but<00:03:03.709> for<00:03:03.920> some

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
best battery out there but for some

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.089 
best battery out there but for some
reason<00:03:04.819> it<00:03:04.940> still<00:03:05.269> can't<00:03:05.630> match<00:03:05.900> what<00:03:06.890> these

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:07.099 
reason it still can't match what these

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:10.060 
reason it still can't match what these
little<00:03:07.600> vtc<00:03:08.600> force<00:03:08.900> can<00:03:09.200> do<00:03:09.350> fresh<00:03:09.620> off<00:03:09.890> the

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
little vtc force can do fresh off the

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.330 
little vtc force can do fresh off the
charger<00:03:10.549> now<00:03:10.700> it<00:03:10.880> can<00:03:11.060> go<00:03:11.269> twice<00:03:11.750> as<00:03:12.019> long<00:03:12.340> but

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
charger now it can go twice as long but

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.090 
charger now it can go twice as long but
it<00:03:13.519> just<00:03:13.790> won't<00:03:14.000> drive<00:03:14.390> the<00:03:14.810> super<00:03:15.260> loans<00:03:15.680> as

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
it just won't drive the super loans as

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.699 
it just won't drive the super loans as
well<00:03:16.450> it'll<00:03:17.450> do<00:03:17.600> it<00:03:17.750> and<00:03:17.870> not<00:03:17.989> get<00:03:18.260> hot<00:03:18.440> you

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
well it'll do it and not get hot you

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.560 
well it'll do it and not get hot you
know<00:03:18.829> no<00:03:19.100> problem<00:03:19.340> there<00:03:19.790> but<00:03:20.030> it<00:03:20.150> just<00:03:20.329> won't

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
know no problem there but it just won't

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.199 
know no problem there but it just won't
deliver<00:03:21.440> the<00:03:21.590> the<00:03:22.130> voltage<00:03:22.579> and<00:03:22.790> current<00:03:23.150> to

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
deliver the the voltage and current to

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.660 
deliver the the voltage and current to
the<00:03:23.420> coil<00:03:23.630> like<00:03:23.989> this<00:03:24.230> thing<00:03:24.500> will<00:03:24.739> but<00:03:25.040> this

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
the coil like this thing will but this

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:32.800 
the coil like this thing will but this
