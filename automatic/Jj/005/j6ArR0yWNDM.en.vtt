00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
you use the MC patcher to have the HD

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.580 
you use the MC patcher to have the HD
texture<00:00:25.609> so<00:00:26.630> to<00:00:27.630> do<00:00:27.750> that<00:00:27.779> first<00:00:28.199> you<00:00:28.410> have

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
texture so to do that first you have

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.759 
texture so to do that first you have
obviously<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:29.369> download<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:30.000> MC<00:00:30.570> patcher<00:00:30.769> the

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
obviously to download the MC patcher the

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.920 
obviously to download the MC patcher the
link<00:00:31.980> is<00:00:32.160> going<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.430> be<00:00:32.550> in<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.390> description

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
link is going to be in the description

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.600 
link is going to be in the description
or<00:00:34.110> you<00:00:34.260> can<00:00:34.470> simply<00:00:34.710> search<00:00:35.160> it<00:00:35.370> on<00:00:35.550> google
