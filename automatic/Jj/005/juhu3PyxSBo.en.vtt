studios<00:00:18.180> in<00:00:18.390> LA<00:00:18.539> and<00:00:19.020> this<00:00:19.199> is<00:00:19.380> my<00:00:19.560> primary

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:20.119 
studios in LA and this is my primary

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:23.540 
studios in LA and this is my primary
setup<00:00:21.119> and<00:00:21.470> when<00:00:22.470> it<00:00:22.560> comes<00:00:22.769> to<00:00:22.920> symbols<00:00:23.369> I

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
setup and when it comes to symbols I

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.060 
setup and when it comes to symbols I
kind<00:00:24.090> of<00:00:24.150> have<00:00:24.330> like<00:00:24.359> my<00:00:24.810> primary<00:00:25.289> setup<00:00:25.920> that

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
kind of have like my primary setup that

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.700 
kind of have like my primary setup that
I<00:00:26.099> use<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.789> then<00:00:26.910> there's<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:27.720> couple<00:00:27.990> things

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
I use and then there's a couple things

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.589 
I use and then there's a couple things
that<00:00:28.859> get<00:00:29.039> substituted<00:00:29.369> in<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.000> out<00:00:30.119> here<00:00:30.449> and

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
that get substituted in and out here and

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.959 
that get substituted in and out here and
there<00:00:30.750> but<00:00:30.990> this<00:00:31.679> setup<00:00:32.189> of<00:00:32.340> symbols<00:00:32.759> is

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
there but this setup of symbols is

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.250 
there but this setup of symbols is
something<00:00:33.329> that<00:00:33.450> I've<00:00:33.570> put<00:00:33.809> together<00:00:33.930> over

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
something that I've put together over

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.350 
something that I've put together over
many<00:00:34.950> many<00:00:35.190> years<00:00:35.370> I've<00:00:35.790> been<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:35.969> Zildjian

artist for 20-some years and some of
these<00:00:38.820> symbols<00:00:39.300> are<00:00:39.770> 15<00:00:40.770> almost<00:00:41.520> 17<00:00:42.120> years<00:00:42.360> old

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
these symbols are 15 almost 17 years old

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.229 
these symbols are 15 almost 17 years old
because<00:00:43.200> I<00:00:43.590> just<00:00:44.460> found<00:00:44.760> them<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.090> they<00:00:45.180> were

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
because I just found them and they were

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.630 
because I just found them and they were
just<00:00:45.510> so<00:00:45.629> special<00:00:45.960> I've<00:00:46.739> kept<00:00:47.100> them<00:00:47.190> on<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.489> on

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
the set up ever since so let me start

custom session crash that Steve Gadd
helped<00:01:00.899> them<00:01:00.989> design<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:02.090> for<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.180> crashes

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
helped them design and for the crashes

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.149 
helped them design and for the crashes
you<00:01:03.870> know<00:01:03.930> it's<00:01:04.110> really<00:01:04.379> important<00:01:04.830> for<00:01:04.979> me

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
you know it's really important for me

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.310 
you know it's really important for me
that<00:01:05.189> they<00:01:06.000> work<00:01:06.420> together<00:01:06.689> that<00:01:07.140> they

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
that they work together that they

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.980 
that they work together that they
resolve<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.490> same<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.270> fundamental

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
resolve to the the same to a fundamental

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.250 
resolve to the the same to a fundamental
that<00:01:10.110> works<00:01:10.500> in<00:01:10.890> pitch<00:01:11.490> with<00:01:11.729> itself<00:01:12.170> so<00:01:13.170> you

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
that works in pitch with itself so you

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.480 
that works in pitch with itself so you
don't<00:01:13.439> you<00:01:13.890> know<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:14.010> want<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.369> have

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
don't you know you want to have

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.880 
don't you know you want to have
something<00:01:14.850> like<00:01:15.080> sort<00:01:16.080> of<00:01:16.140> settling<00:01:16.619> into<00:01:16.860> a

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
something like sort of settling into a

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.649 
something like sort of settling into a
minor<00:01:17.189> second<00:01:17.670> or<00:01:17.790> something<00:01:18.119> that's<00:01:18.240> kind<00:01:18.630> of

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
minor second or something that's kind of

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.740 
minor second or something that's kind of
clashing<00:01:19.729> you<00:01:20.729> don't<00:01:20.880> have<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.150> be<00:01:21.330> in<00:01:21.630> the

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
clashing you don't have to be in the

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.960 
clashing you don't have to be in the
same<00:01:21.960> pitch<00:01:22.290> family<00:01:22.740> necessarily<00:01:23.340> but<00:01:23.490> they

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
same pitch family necessarily but they

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.390 
same pitch family necessarily but they
need<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.210> settle<00:01:24.540> together<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.290> when<00:01:26.040> I<00:01:26.070> found

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
need to settle together and when I found

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.030 
need to settle together and when I found
this<00:01:27.000> symbol<00:01:27.509> I've<00:01:28.020> had<00:01:28.229> this<00:01:28.409> one<00:01:28.590> for<00:01:28.650> many

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
this symbol I've had this one for many

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.149 
this symbol I've had this one for many
years<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.729> long<00:01:30.119> time<00:01:30.420> it's<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.960> 17<00:01:31.799> inch<00:01:31.979> a

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
years a long time it's a 17 inch a

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.300 
years a long time it's a 17 inch a
custom<00:01:32.759> crash<00:01:33.090> but<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.799> difference<00:01:35.159> between

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
custom crash but the difference between

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.280 
custom crash but the difference between
this<00:01:35.729> one<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.000> other<00:01:36.509> ones<00:01:36.780> is<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.110> has<00:01:37.259> a

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
this one and other ones is it has a

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.609 
this one and other ones is it has a
hi-hat<00:01:37.770> cup<00:01:38.070> on<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:39.200> they<00:01:40.200> did<00:01:40.409> that<00:01:40.560> for

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
hi-hat cup on it and they did that for

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.300 
hi-hat cup on it and they did that for
about<00:01:41.460> 30<00:01:41.790> seconds<00:01:42.390> in<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:43.110> hidden<00:01:43.380> early<00:01:43.799> 90s

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
about 30 seconds in the hidden early 90s

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.850 
about 30 seconds in the hidden early 90s
and<00:01:44.549> I<00:01:45.090> talked<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.540> Paul<00:01:45.720> Francis<00:01:46.049> at<00:01:46.439> Zildjian

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
and I talked to Paul Francis at Zildjian

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.840 
and I talked to Paul Francis at Zildjian
about<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.479> they've<00:01:48.479> since<00:01:48.869> changed<00:01:49.409> the

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
about it and they've since changed the

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.030 
about it and they've since changed the
the<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:51.180> cup<00:01:51.420> size<00:01:51.630> on<00:01:51.869> a<00:01:51.899> custom<00:01:52.409> crashes<00:01:52.890> but

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
the the cup size on a custom crashes but

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.370 
the the cup size on a custom crashes but
this<00:01:53.189> one<00:01:53.369> for<00:01:53.579> me<00:01:53.700> was<00:01:53.850> spectacular<00:01:54.540> I<00:01:54.899> was

and this symbol was on the drum set and
as<00:02:05.130> soon<00:02:05.280> as<00:02:05.340> I<00:02:05.520> hit<00:02:05.729> it<00:02:05.790> I<00:02:06.000> was<00:02:06.149> like<00:02:06.329> I'm<00:02:07.110> so

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
as soon as I hit it I was like I'm so

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.380 
as soon as I hit it I was like I'm so
sorry<00:02:07.920> but<00:02:08.190> I<00:02:08.220> had<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.459> take<00:02:08.640> this<00:02:08.849> symbol<00:02:09.209> so<00:02:09.360> I

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
sorry but I had to take this symbol so I

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.229 
sorry but I had to take this symbol so I
took<00:02:09.599> this<00:02:09.989> symbol<00:02:10.470> back<00:02:10.860> as<00:02:11.069> iljin<00:02:11.580> and<00:02:11.819> they

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
took this symbol back as iljin and they

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.760 
took this symbol back as iljin and they
gave<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.690> booth<00:02:12.870> another<00:02:13.170> symbol<00:02:13.560> and<00:02:13.680> I've

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
gave the booth another symbol and I've

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:14.059 
gave the booth another symbol and I've
had

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
had

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.339 
had
ever<00:02:14.189> since<00:02:14.459> so<00:02:14.849> these<00:02:15.569> two<00:02:15.810> symbols<00:02:16.049> work

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
ever since so these two symbols work

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:20.300 
ever since so these two symbols work
really<00:02:16.590> well<00:02:16.769> for<00:02:16.829> me<00:02:17.389> right<00:02:18.389> here<00:02:18.989> is<00:02:19.200> a<00:02:19.680> 19

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
really well for me right here is a 19

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.509 
really well for me right here is a 19

crash<00:02:23.819> ride<00:02:24.150> and<00:02:24.799> I<00:02:26.060> love<00:02:27.060> having<00:02:27.239> a<00:02:27.450> crash

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:27.689 
crash ride and I love having a crash

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:30.500 
crash ride and I love having a crash
right<00:02:27.959> here<00:02:28.379> on<00:02:28.560> lighter<00:02:29.189> gigs<00:02:29.609> it<00:02:30.090> becomes

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
right here on lighter gigs it becomes

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.050 
right here on lighter gigs it becomes
like<00:02:31.079> almost<00:02:31.379> a<00:02:31.530> primary<00:02:32.040> ride<00:02:32.310> cymbal<00:02:32.760> for<00:02:32.909> me

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
like almost a primary ride cymbal for me

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.170 
like almost a primary ride cymbal for me
and<00:02:33.269> on<00:02:33.750> bigger<00:02:34.349> gigs<00:02:34.709> it's<00:02:35.219> a<00:02:35.400> primary<00:02:35.670> crash

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
and on bigger gigs it's a primary crash

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.559 
and on bigger gigs it's a primary crash
for<00:02:36.510> me<00:02:36.629> so<00:02:36.870> it's<00:02:37.590> a<00:02:37.739> very<00:02:37.980> effective<00:02:38.370> way<00:02:38.730> to

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
for me so it's a very effective way to

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.599 
for me so it's a very effective way to
use<00:02:39.599> this<00:02:40.049> space<00:02:40.409> you<00:02:40.769> know<00:02:40.889> to<00:02:40.980> have<00:02:41.250> a<00:02:41.280> crash

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:41.609 
use this space you know to have a crash

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:44.209 
use this space you know to have a crash
ride<00:02:41.939> and<00:02:42.239> that<00:02:42.450> that's<00:02:42.599> a<00:02:42.780> great<00:02:43.079> cymbal<00:02:43.530> was

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:44.219 
ride and that that's a great cymbal was

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:47.690 
ride and that that's a great cymbal was
released<00:02:44.579> last<00:02:44.790> year<00:02:44.999> I<00:02:45.180> think<00:02:46.340> the<00:02:47.340> primary

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
released last year I think the primary

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.839 
released last year I think the primary
ride<00:02:48.120> cymbal<00:02:48.629> is<00:02:48.750> a<00:02:48.780> 21<00:02:49.319> inch<00:02:49.579> sound<00:02:50.579> lab

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:08.189 
small Bell and one of the things that I

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:10.939 
small Bell and one of the things that I
find<00:03:08.430> about<00:03:08.549> rides<00:03:08.969> is<00:03:09.389> that<00:03:10.230> you<00:03:10.439> got<00:03:10.590> to<00:03:10.709> keep

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:10.949 
find about rides is that you got to keep

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:14.030 
find about rides is that you got to keep
away<00:03:11.250> from<00:03:11.579> a<00:03:11.939> ride<00:03:12.359> cymbal<00:03:12.599> that<00:03:12.780> has<00:03:13.590> a<00:03:13.620> pitch

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
away from a ride cymbal that has a pitch

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.179 
away from a ride cymbal that has a pitch
to<00:03:14.069> it<00:03:14.489> especially<00:03:15.180> the<00:03:15.750> bell<00:03:16.019> the<00:03:16.319> bell<00:03:16.560> can

00:03:17.179 --> 00:03:17.189 
to it especially the bell the bell can

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:19.339 
to it especially the bell the bell can
have<00:03:17.430> a<00:03:17.459> very<00:03:17.909> distinct<00:03:18.449> pitch<00:03:18.720> to<00:03:18.989> it<00:03:19.139> which

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:19.349 
have a very distinct pitch to it which

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:20.839 
have a very distinct pitch to it which
can<00:03:19.560> clash<00:03:19.889> with<00:03:20.250> things<00:03:20.549> when<00:03:20.729> you're

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:20.849 
can clash with things when you're

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:22.520 
can clash with things when you're
recording<00:03:21.209> it<00:03:21.509> depending<00:03:21.900> what<00:03:21.989> the<00:03:22.049> key<00:03:22.349> is

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
recording it depending what the key is

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.740 
recording it depending what the key is
and<00:03:22.799> the<00:03:23.790> other<00:03:23.819> thing<00:03:24.180> is<00:03:24.329> when<00:03:24.540> it's<00:03:24.659> a

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
and the other thing is when it's a

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.429 
and the other thing is when it's a
really<00:03:25.109> big<00:03:25.590> fat<00:03:26.040> thick<00:03:26.430> bell<00:03:26.759> it<00:03:27.229> jumps<00:03:28.229> in

00:03:28.429 --> 00:03:28.439 
really big fat thick bell it jumps in

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:31.189 
really big fat thick bell it jumps in
the<00:03:28.949> mix<00:03:29.280> really<00:03:29.909> loud<00:03:30.180> into<00:03:30.599> the<00:03:30.689> overheads

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:31.199 
the mix really loud into the overheads

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:33.830 
the mix really loud into the overheads
and<00:03:31.439> it<00:03:31.530> sort<00:03:31.769> of<00:03:31.829> occupies<00:03:32.819> all<00:03:33.239> the<00:03:33.449> sonic

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
and it sort of occupies all the sonic

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.349 
and it sort of occupies all the sonic
space<00:03:34.199> while<00:03:34.919> you're<00:03:34.949> hitting<00:03:35.250> it<00:03:35.549> so<00:03:35.790> having

for me has been really happening and I'm
really<00:05:29.610> diggin<00:05:30.210> how<00:05:30.300> it<00:05:30.479> sits<00:05:30.750> into<00:05:30.960> the<00:05:31.140> whole

cymbal<00:05:31.680> family<00:05:32.070> and<00:05:32.390> that<00:05:33.390> that's<00:05:33.600> my<00:05:33.750> primary

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.110 
cymbal family and that that's my primary

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:36.620 
cymbal family and that that's my primary
setup<00:05:34.680> I<00:05:34.830> do<00:05:35.010> alternate<00:05:35.940> a<00:05:35.970> couple<00:05:36.360> things

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:36.630 
setup I do alternate a couple things

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:40.040 
setup I do alternate a couple things
here<00:05:36.870> and<00:05:36.960> there<00:05:37.169> but<00:05:38.630> when<00:05:39.630> I<00:05:39.660> think<00:05:39.960> about

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 
here and there but when I think about

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.980 
here and there but when I think about
cymbals<00:05:40.590> I<00:05:40.710> think<00:05:40.919> about<00:05:41.130> stuff<00:05:41.520> that<00:05:41.990> works

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 
cymbals I think about stuff that works

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.650 
cymbals I think about stuff that works
very<00:05:43.500> very<00:05:43.650> well<00:05:43.890> together<00:05:44.340> the<00:05:45.270> other<00:05:45.360> thing

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:45.660 
very very well together the other thing

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.250 
very very well together the other thing
is<00:05:45.840> I<00:05:46.169> keep<00:05:46.470> everything<00:05:46.620> at<00:05:46.979> the<00:05:47.100> same<00:05:47.370> plane

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:48.260 
is I keep everything at the same plane

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:52.370 
is I keep everything at the same plane
here<00:05:49.260> and<00:05:49.410> that's<00:05:50.070> for<00:05:51.110> miking<00:05:52.110> and<00:05:52.260> for

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:52.380 
here and that's for miking and for

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.469 
here and that's for miking and for
recording<00:05:52.919> especially<00:05:53.430> because<00:05:53.610> if<00:05:54.000> you<00:05:54.330> have

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:54.479 
recording especially because if you have

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:57.080 
recording especially because if you have
one<00:05:54.510> cymbal<00:05:55.200> really<00:05:55.470> high<00:05:55.710> and<00:05:56.070> one<00:05:56.520> low<00:05:56.550> every

one cymbal really high and one low every
time<00:05:57.270> you<00:05:57.360> hit<00:05:57.479> this<00:05:57.660> cymbal<00:05:58.080> jumps<00:05:58.770> into<00:05:58.979> the

00:05:59.090 --> 00:05:59.100 
time you hit this cymbal jumps into the

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:01.580 
time you hit this cymbal jumps into the
room<00:05:59.340> and<00:05:59.520> the<00:05:59.610> overheads<00:06:00.110> way<00:06:01.110> more<00:06:01.380> than<00:06:01.530> the

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:01.590 
room and the overheads way more than the

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:04.130 
room and the overheads way more than the
other<00:06:01.740> ones<00:06:02.010> and<00:06:02.280> it's<00:06:03.150> really<00:06:03.479> important<00:06:03.990> for

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:04.140 
other ones and it's really important for

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:05.810 
other ones and it's really important for
me<00:06:04.289> to<00:06:04.320> have<00:06:04.590> a<00:06:04.620> very<00:06:04.830> good<00:06:05.070> mix<00:06:05.400> when<00:06:05.700> I'm

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:05.820 
me to have a very good mix when I'm

me to have a very good mix when I'm
playing<00:06:06.150> so<00:06:06.930> that<00:06:06.960> the<00:06:07.680> engineer<00:06:08.310> and<00:06:08.610> intern

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.240 
playing so that the engineer and intern

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.300 
playing so that the engineer and intern

the producer the artist can use the room
mics<00:06:11.640> and<00:06:12.000> the<00:06:12.110> overheads<00:06:13.110> as<00:06:13.410> a<00:06:14.400> source<00:06:14.910> for

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240 
mics and the overheads as a source for

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.260 
mics and the overheads as a source for

the drum sound and the overheads are

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.960 
the drum sound and the overheads are
like<00:06:18.419> a<00:06:18.450> big<00:06:18.750> part<00:06:18.990> of<00:06:19.050> my<00:06:19.200> drum<00:06:19.440> sound<00:06:19.740> so<00:06:20.039> if

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:20.970 
like a big part of my drum sound so if

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:22.880 
like a big part of my drum sound so if
you<00:06:21.270> don't<00:06:21.690> have<00:06:21.900> a<00:06:21.930> good<00:06:22.229> mix<00:06:22.620> in<00:06:22.860> your

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:22.890 
you don't have a good mix in your

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:25.340 
you don't have a good mix in your
playing<00:06:23.250> or<00:06:23.820> if<00:06:24.060> you<00:06:24.150> have<00:06:24.330> cymbals<00:06:24.870> real<00:06:25.110> high

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:25.350 
playing or if you have cymbals real high

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:27.680 
playing or if you have cymbals real high
and<00:06:25.380> over<00:06:25.710> here<00:06:26.010> and<00:06:26.130> over<00:06:26.280> there<00:06:26.310> and<00:06:26.729> things

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:27.690 
and over here and over there and things

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:30.080 
and over here and over there and things
jump<00:06:28.260> out<00:06:28.440> in<00:06:28.650> the<00:06:28.680> mix<00:06:29.010> you<00:06:29.430> start<00:06:29.820> to

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:30.090 
jump out in the mix you start to

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:32.810 
jump out in the mix you start to
eliminate<00:06:30.720> the<00:06:31.350> ability<00:06:31.950> for<00:06:31.979> them<00:06:32.280> to<00:06:32.340> use

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:32.820 
eliminate the ability for them to use

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:35.870 
eliminate the ability for them to use
those<00:06:33.150> stereo<00:06:33.690> miking<00:06:34.260> techniques<00:06:34.880> because

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:35.880 
those stereo miking techniques because

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.210 
those stereo miking techniques because
they<00:06:36.120> can't<00:06:36.390> mix<00:06:36.690> it<00:06:36.900> and<00:06:36.990> adjust<00:06:37.140> it<00:06:37.530> like

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:38.220 
they can't mix it and adjust it like

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:39.980 
they can't mix it and adjust it like
they<00:06:38.370> can<00:06:38.640> with<00:06:38.849> closed<00:06:39.120> mic<00:06:39.419> so

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:39.990 
they can with closed mic so

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:42.290 
they can with closed mic so
it's<00:06:40.320> a<00:06:40.410> very<00:06:40.620> important<00:06:41.160> point<00:06:41.820> with<00:06:42.180> the

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:42.300 
it's a very important point with the

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.210 
it's a very important point with the
symbols<00:06:42.750> to<00:06:42.840> keep<00:06:43.199> them<00:06:43.410> in<00:06:43.500> the<00:06:43.590> same<00:06:43.830> plane

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:44.220 
symbols to keep them in the same plane

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:47.570 
symbols to keep them in the same plane
and<00:06:44.669> not<00:06:45.660> play<00:06:45.990> the<00:06:46.169> symbols<00:06:46.680> really<00:06:47.250> really

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:47.580 
and not play the symbols really really

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:50.480 
and not play the symbols really really
loud<00:06:47.820> because<00:06:48.630> that's<00:06:49.380> another<00:06:49.710> problem<00:06:50.070> is

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:50.490 
loud because that's another problem is

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:52.760 
loud because that's another problem is
if<00:06:50.729> you<00:06:51.210> have<00:06:51.240> high<00:06:51.570> hats<00:06:51.870> that<00:06:52.139> cut<00:06:52.440> and<00:06:52.470> are

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:52.770 
if you have high hats that cut and are

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:53.629 
if you have high hats that cut and are
really<00:06:53.100> loud

00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:53.639 
really loud

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:55.909 
really loud
they<00:06:53.880> bleed<00:06:54.300> so<00:06:54.570> much<00:06:54.600> into<00:06:55.050> the<00:06:55.139> the<00:06:55.410> snare

00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:55.919 
they bleed so much into the the snare

00:06:55.919 --> 00:06:57.650 
they bleed so much into the the snare
drum<00:06:56.160> microphone<00:06:56.699> that<00:06:56.910> you<00:06:56.940> can't<00:06:57.270> get<00:06:57.479> rid

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:57.660 
drum microphone that you can't get rid

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:00.800 
drum microphone that you can't get rid
of<00:06:57.780> them<00:06:57.930> in<00:06:58.050> the<00:06:58.139> mix<00:06:58.410> so<00:06:59.009> I<00:06:59.370> I<00:06:59.789> spent<00:07:00.539> a<00:07:00.570> lot<00:07:00.780> of

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:00.810 
of them in the mix so I I spent a lot of

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:04.659 
of them in the mix so I I spent a lot of
time<00:07:01.139> I<00:07:01.530> studied<00:07:02.039> with<00:07:02.100> Peter<00:07:02.310> Erskine<00:07:02.820> and

00:07:21.409 --> 00:07:21.419 
cymbals and listen to cymbals I'm

00:07:21.419 --> 00:07:23.300 
cymbals and listen to cymbals I'm
thinking<00:07:22.110> about<00:07:22.349> those<00:07:22.530> sort<00:07:22.800> of<00:07:22.860> things<00:07:22.919> they

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:23.310 
thinking about those sort of things they

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:25.760 
thinking about those sort of things they
work<00:07:23.520> together<00:07:23.699> they<00:07:24.120> have<00:07:24.270> no<00:07:24.449> pitches<00:07:25.020> they

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:25.770 
work together they have no pitches they

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:28.249 
work together they have no pitches they
sit<00:07:26.130> in<00:07:26.250> the<00:07:26.370> mix<00:07:26.639> and<00:07:26.970> in<00:07:27.449> my<00:07:27.660> playing<00:07:27.960> I

00:07:28.249 --> 00:07:28.259 
sit in the mix and in my playing I

00:07:28.259 --> 00:07:30.950 
sit in the mix and in my playing I
adjust<00:07:28.680> a<00:07:28.830> mix<00:07:29.070> to<00:07:29.280> work<00:07:29.490> in<00:07:29.789> a<00:07:30.240> stereo<00:07:30.630> feel

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:30.960 
adjust a mix to work in a stereo feel

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.499 
adjust a mix to work in a stereo feel
out<00:07:31.199> front<00:07:31.530> so<00:07:31.800> my<00:07:32.699> thoughts<00:07:32.970> on<00:07:33.150> the<00:07:33.240> cymbal

00:07:33.499 --> 00:07:33.509 
out front so my thoughts on the cymbal
