00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.420
 good afternoon dear channel viewers 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.690
 window plants with you as always 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:19.340
 Maxim and Elena and with us today 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.260
 hippeastrum it's time in the end 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:29.279
 prune this plant 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:32.540
 he has blossomed and will soon issue 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:36.630
 foliage to 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:40.550
 the foliage went much faster we need 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:44.600
 trim it we will do it 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.600
 completely without remorse 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.289
 we have a good bulb and now we will 

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:56.800
 to wait 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:59.350
 pokamist he will give foliage 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.829
 as you know gippeastrum first 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.869
 blooms and then he goes out very 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:08.320
 a large number of long lanceolate 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:10.960
 very beautiful leaves and only already 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:14.200
 closer to the ground these leaves begin 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.750
 die off and you cut them off too in essence 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.860
 it turns out that gippeastrum eyes year 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:24.670
 holds 2 trim 1 trim it 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:27.039
 peduncle and 2 pruning this foliage 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.140
 hippeastrum just like amaryllis 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:32.229
 Amaryllis also maintains 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.479
 first 1 pruning and then second 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:36.580
 in fact, they differ only 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:43.539
 so that one of them 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:46.119
 hollow barrel 2 in one floor and this 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:48.850
 Here's the second part of this whole, yet 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:50.619
 from the core and the amount of flooring 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.860
 hippeastrum flowers 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:54.570
 from four to six in amaryllis from 6 to 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.640
 12 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.770
 that's all the difference and strictly speaking 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.100
 they look the same and care 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.800
 by them 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:05.460
 exactly the same as our onion 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:08.250
 here in this state now some 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.649
 time until hay colors I cleaned it 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.570
 in partial shade now again I will put on 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:16.770
 bright place I 'll start 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:18.630
 water more and let them give leaves a 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.610
 in the fall we are together 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.690
 cut and spring you all the best 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.690
