tent there's no lights around so that's

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:23.790

gonna be pretty pitch-black
so<00:02:24.220> let's<00:02:24.370> go<00:02:24.459> test<00:02:24.670> it<00:02:24.820> in<00:02:24.940> a<00:02:25.000> pitch-black

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
so let's go test it in a pitch-black

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:26.880
