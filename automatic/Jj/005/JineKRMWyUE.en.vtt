00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
first you obviously don't want to block

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.480 
first you obviously don't want to block
your<00:02:04.060> Bishop<00:02:04.479> so<00:02:04.740> blacks<00:02:05.740> first<00:02:06.070> move<00:02:06.310> is

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
your Bishop so blacks first move is

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.509 
your Bishop so blacks first move is

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:09.519 
going to be Bishop to b4

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:13.770 
going to be Bishop to b4
and<00:02:09.840> from<00:02:10.840> here<00:02:11.049> you<00:02:11.200> often<00:02:11.500> see<00:02:11.739> Knight<00:02:12.310> to<00:02:12.909> d2

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
and from here you often see Knight to d2

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.080 
and from here you often see Knight to d2
kind<00:02:14.769> of<00:02:14.860> setting<00:02:15.129> up<00:02:15.220> the<00:02:15.340> trap<00:02:15.579> in<00:02:15.760> itself

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
kind of setting up the trap in itself

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.210 
kind of setting up the trap in itself
and<00:02:16.360> from<00:02:16.959> here<00:02:17.200> black<00:02:17.409> is<00:02:17.650> going<00:02:17.890> to<00:02:17.950> continue

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
and from here black is going to continue

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.600 
and from here black is going to continue
with<00:02:18.579> Queen<00:02:19.030> to<00:02:19.420> e7<00:02:20.280> obviously<00:02:21.280> as<00:02:21.370> you<00:02:21.459> can

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
with Queen to e7 obviously as you can

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.640 
with Queen to e7 obviously as you can
see<00:02:21.790> now<00:02:21.939> we<00:02:22.000> have<00:02:22.180> three<00:02:22.900> attackers<00:02:23.230> on<00:02:23.530> the

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
see now we have three attackers on the

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.330 
see now we have three attackers on the
e5<00:02:24.040> pawn<00:02:24.069> and<00:02:24.579> white<00:02:25.269> only<00:02:25.510> has<00:02:25.870> two<00:02:26.829> defenders

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
e5 pawn and white only has two defenders

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.610 
e5 pawn and white only has two defenders
so<00:02:27.579> why<00:02:27.849> it's<00:02:27.970> going<00:02:28.180> to<00:02:28.239> have<00:02:28.329> to<00:02:28.590> choose<00:02:29.590> a

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
so why it's going to have to choose a

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.020 
so why it's going to have to choose a
different<00:02:30.010> strategy<00:02:30.189> and<00:02:30.459> from<00:02:30.670> here<00:02:30.849> a<00:02:30.879> lot

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
different strategy and from here a lot

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.809 
different strategy and from here a lot
of<00:02:31.090> times<00:02:31.269> you'll<00:02:31.450> see<00:02:31.530> pawn<00:02:32.530> to<00:02:33.099> e3<00:02:34.500> basically

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
of times you'll see pawn to e3 basically

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.610 
of times you'll see pawn to e3 basically
attacking<00:02:36.819> the<00:02:36.909> bishop<00:02:37.060> and<00:02:37.390> trying<00:02:38.079> to<00:02:38.260> kick

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
attacking the bishop and trying to kick

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.520 
attacking the bishop and trying to kick
that<00:02:38.769> out<00:02:38.950> here<00:02:39.189> and<00:02:39.400> from<00:02:40.390> here<00:02:40.450> black<00:02:41.409> can

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
that out here and from here black can

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.860 
that out here and from here black can
actually<00:02:42.040> safely<00:02:42.579> take<00:02:43.030> on<00:02:43.950> e5<00:02:45.870> obviously

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
actually safely take on e5 obviously

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.830 
actually safely take on e5 obviously
white<00:02:47.349> if<00:02:48.129> they<00:02:48.370> capture<00:02:48.700> this<00:02:49.329> Knight<00:02:49.629> they

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
white if they capture this Knight they

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.069 
white if they capture this Knight they
have<00:02:50.019> two<00:02:50.769> attackers<00:02:51.099> and<00:02:51.579> black<00:02:52.540> has<00:02:52.810> two

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:53.079 
have two attackers and black has two

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:55.170 
have two attackers and black has two
defenders<00:02:53.500> so<00:02:54.010> they<00:02:54.129> can<00:02:54.310> easily<00:02:54.790> hold<00:02:54.970> onto

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
defenders so they can easily hold onto

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.319 
defenders so they can easily hold onto
this<00:02:55.450> pawn<00:02:55.810> that<00:02:56.049> they<00:02:56.170> captured<00:02:56.590> and<00:02:57.549> here<00:02:58.150> is

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
this pawn that they captured and here is

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:00.270 
this pawn that they captured and here is
the<00:02:58.569> trap<00:02:58.840> and<00:02:59.079> so<00:02:59.290> many<00:02:59.530> players<00:02:59.769> will<00:03:00.010> fall

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
the trap and so many players will fall

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.800 
the trap and so many players will fall
for<00:03:00.549> it<00:03:00.670> if<00:03:00.760> they<00:03:00.909> are<00:03:00.939> not<00:03:01.239> looking<00:03:01.450> and

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
for it if they are not looking and

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.300 
for it if they are not looking and
that's<00:03:02.319> simply<00:03:02.680> a<00:03:04.049> captures<00:03:05.049> Bishop<00:03:05.439> on<00:03:05.829> b4

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
that's simply a captures Bishop on b4

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.369 
that's simply a captures Bishop on b4
and<00:03:06.579> from<00:03:07.120> here<00:03:07.359> you<00:03:07.510> can<00:03:07.659> probably<00:03:07.959> see<00:03:08.349> it

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:08.379 
and from here you can probably see it

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:13.939 
and from here you can probably see it
black<00:03:09.370> can<00:03:09.670> come<00:03:09.939> in<00:03:10.620> to<00:03:11.620> d3<00:03:12.120> unexpectedly<00:03:13.120> and

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:13.949 
black can come in to d3 unexpectedly and

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:18.780 
black can come in to d3 unexpectedly and

budapest gamete if you're black then

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:24.539 
budapest gamete if you're black then

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
look out for this if white tries to hold

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:28.110 
look out for this if white tries to hold
on<00:03:24.819> to<00:03:25.480> their<00:03:25.659> pawn<00:03:25.930> on<00:03:26.139> e5<00:03:26.500> and<00:03:26.799> you<00:03:27.639> see<00:03:27.909> this
