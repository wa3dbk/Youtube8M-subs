00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 In this world, sometime 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 I visited a beautiful prisoner. 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:20.000
 And the only way to talk to him 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 it was by paper planes ... 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.500
 When my father goes to his job 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.500
 I escape from the hospital 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:15.600
 To be with you, and give you a special moment 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.600
 Every time I read your letters, 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.600
 My heart is happy. 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:40.600
 How to hide it? If our love is so great. 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.600
 And I'm still listening to my father repeat 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.600
 That ours should not exist 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.800
 But give up on you That Never! 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.800
 Being next to you is the only thing I want to do 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:05.800
 Or is it that love is prohibition? 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.800
 This room is gradually becoming clearer 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:18.800
 by revealing that much pain awaits us. 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.800
 Desperate to achieve and be with you 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:34.000
 I notice how far I am. 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.500
 And lost without advancing 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.500
 I dream that I go to your side. 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:52.500
 Again I do not see anything and I feel my body cold, 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.500
 It is death approaching. 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:07.500
 I'm so worried, what will you do when it's my end? 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.500
 And I run throwing an airplane made of paper, 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.000
 giving you a plane for the last time 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:20.500
 I will not cry anymore after this cruel end. 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:27.500
 Do not go partner with my heart 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.500
 Will not you go back to this prison? 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:38.500
 I have saved the letters I received from you 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:45.500
 And for you to come again, I'll wait ... 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.500
 Exactly from that time 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:53.500
 and my body has not moved again. 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:59.500
 Soon this ordeal with me will end 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:06.000
 And with the fence that saw away. 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 Come back to me, I need you 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 to follow 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.500
 But you are so far away from me today. 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:23.500
 And if I can no longer contemplate you smile 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:28.500
 It will hurt, it will hurt, it will DOLL !! 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:41.500
 There is no light to illuminate this flower that became extinct 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:47.500
 We can not change what happened 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:53.500
 I just want to see your love letters 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:59.500
 Or my light will gradually lose its radiance 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:05.500
 I have saved the cards although weak I am 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:11.500
 I have to hurry up and go to my room 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:17.500
 Please, if I die, I have a request 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:23.500
 It is that you live and overcome the pain 

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.500
 Since that day nothing has separated us again 

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:48.000
 And our big smile will never erase us again 

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:54.000
 The deep darkness surrounds us both 

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 Away from all traces of happiness 

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000
 See you tomorrow... 

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 ...In that place...
