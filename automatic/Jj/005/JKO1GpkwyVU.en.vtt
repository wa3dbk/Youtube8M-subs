our very small pod and it slides right

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.289 
our very small pod and it slides right
into<00:03:06.950> the<00:03:07.160> slot<00:03:07.430> that's<00:03:07.640> on<00:03:07.760> the<00:03:07.880> top<00:03:08.030> of<00:03:08.209> the

this<00:03:10.010> up<00:03:10.190> because<00:03:10.459> that<00:03:10.640> slot<00:03:11.150> is<00:03:11.420> just<00:03:11.660> the

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
this up because that slot is just the

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.319

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.960 
machine it's not overly sweet it's
definitely<00:04:13.740> not<00:04:13.920> as<00:04:14.130> if<00:04:14.310> you<00:04:14.430> had<00:04:14.550> added<00:04:14.880> a
