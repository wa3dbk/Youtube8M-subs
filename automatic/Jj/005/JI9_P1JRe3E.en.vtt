00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:10.139
 26.9 degrees the right temperature for 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:12.160
 lower the dough into the fermenter 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.240
 the temperature is really high 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.430
 past 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.580
 it seems to me 22 days from the people of the leaven 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:20.200
 due to time problems we do not have 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.130
 maybe later bottles 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:26.800
 we bottle for the moment balances 0 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:30.090
 the other fermenter then I make a 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:33.309
 racking and then later in the evening 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.710
 we bottle if all is well what 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:40.690
 I will go to the sanitizer and the fermenter 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:44.429
 obviously being able to enjoy towards us 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.429
 not even the bubbler is needed 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:48.550
 tap 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:53.079
 not even the sediment plug now 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:57.219
 therefore we need life for 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:58.899
 tap this either there 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:01.329
 need that was the seal runs 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:04.049
 mean then followed the seal 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:06.460
 of the tap 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.890
 here we have the lid this is a bit 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.750
 because we say particular the only one 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.610
 difference is that there is a hole here this 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.380
 we are for the transfer is a piece that 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.900
 we bought separately indeed it was me 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.730
 given by sarah together with many of a 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.500
 many but others at Christmas many others 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:24.340
 beautiful things including the barley wine 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:27.940
 famous that the stout then we use these 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:30.100
 tubes for the transfer to and then we miss 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.980
 after I show you the bar for 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.860
 bottling now I don't know where it is 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:38.110
 but we will find it as usual now 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.870
 I soak all these 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:44.710
 in short, small accessories are also i 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:46.600
 doubts the agreements here in the hot water 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.910
 with bleach 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.790
 the jolie soak for a while after 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:55.030
 rinse and then from a good pass of 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.930
 bisulfite water went up the whole e 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.409
 take off between escape route 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:01.780
 see you soon then 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.909
 bottles the first of bottles 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.930
 for those who do not know we must 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:09.190
 add August sugar or yes 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.880
 can do our way we can 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.950
 to add 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.260
 a measuring cup that will surely succeed from 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.260
 kit and where any type of kit for 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:20.350
 beer you buy contains inside 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:24.340
 the measuring cup that we don't find now though 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:26.800
 we won't use it because it turns out 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.710
 more comfortable instead of using the 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.060
 measuring cup and add one each time 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.190
 small amount of sugar in each 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.430
 bottle before putting the beer 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:39.160
 inside we prepare a little water in which 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.870
 we will mix dextrose but you can 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.880
 also use regular sugar it 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.530
 brown sugar I do not recommend 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.120
 use the malt extract for the 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.340
 carbonation this part is called 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:52.240
 carbonation or priming as 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:55.420
 the malt extract as mentioned above is not 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:57.700
 completely digestible by yeasts here 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.710
 we need precise quantity in 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.260
 how this will affect the result 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:05.290
 final of the beer on the foam 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.660
 on the sparkling and then there is also the 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.960
 risk that you will reach too much 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.610
 sugar you do not know me regular 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.820
 They may explode the bottles have 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.590
 never happened though reading on the internet 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.420
 I believe that it is not that it breaks the 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.490
 bottle explodes just that is you have to 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.780
 be careful so don't overdo it 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:24.820
 so much sugar at this stage 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.340
 add sugar does not match for 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.990
 example has more alcohol no this serves 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.990
 just for the foam basically 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:33.490
 so as you can imagine later 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:36.130
 fermentation bottling 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.750
 part continues a second let's say 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.640
 fermentation even if in fact the 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:43.780
 fermentation never stops slows down 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.440
 a lot seems absent but there is in this 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.880
 phase 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.010
 since the bottle is closed 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.170
 Hermetically there is no bubbler 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.959
 which lets gas out of the gas remains 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:55.570
 inside the capped bottle 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:58.360
 you then create these gases then servers 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:01.090
 very little sugar in the overwhelming 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:04.300
 most of the cases we will use 56 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:08.020
 grams per liter in very rare cases such as 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:09.130
 perhaps already mentioned in the first lager videos 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.620
 must not 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.700
 but sugar itself are very cases 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.320
 details 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.360
 so now let's do this 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:20.110
 we prepare a little water half a liter 

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:22.030
 maximum and add the equivalent of 

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:26.770
 six grams per liter we have 23 liters 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:28.590
 so about 138 g we make 130 grams 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.240
 no more just to avoid 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:33.070
 explosions also because it's hot now 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.560
 so probably this thing too 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:38.650
 would favor a thermonuclear reaction 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:41.470
 at home so let's forget it 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:43.060
 prepare a saucepan with water and 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.850
 we do we do to reach 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.770
 abolition so we are also sure that 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:50.050
 water is like saying in quotation marks 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.370
 pure and also the dextrose that we will go to 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.960
 put the sugar in the end 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.840
 we use right-handed because ce 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:58.480
 we will have it in a few months with gwen 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.530
 and so we try to exploit it and 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.650
 then from what we read e 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:04.330
 Dextrose is very melts 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.940
 easily in the water and if not me 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:09.670
 mistake also a lot easier to 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:12.610
 digest by debts 

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:14.590
 after that let's cool this down 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:17.230
 solution substantially and we pay it 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:19.780
 in the fermenter we should then shake 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:23.500
 a little the must in which we will have poured the 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:26.080
 sugar with water doing 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.580
 be careful not to oxygenate so much 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.920
 oxygenation should take place 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.960
 only when we add the yeast 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.930
 then absolutely we must avoid 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.310
 shake it to let the air in 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.480
 substantially during the first 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.950
 fermentation 

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:41.470
 so this time we have to stay a lot 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:43.990
 be careful turning the paddle a lot 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:46.450
 cautious so that the sugar does 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:50.380
 distribute evenly throughout 

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:52.240
 all the must tones that in the bottle 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:55.270
 before I talked about decanting we do a 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:57.610
 decant pro because we have it anyway 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:59.950
 already made one during these days are 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:01.750
 probably more than ten days passed 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:02.310
 ten more days 1 dvd time not 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:04.320
 we have 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:06.570
 I had the chance to do this 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:08.730
 bottling that perhaps the most phase 

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:10.860
 stressful because we have to use zero 

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:12.960
 and bottles must bottle 

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:15.300
 clean everything short annoying because 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:17.160
 however with about sixty 60 70 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:19.500
 more bottles become the quantity 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.390
 from the size of the bottle I said 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:24.150
 the second we do the pouring 

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:26.430
 precisely to eliminate further i 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:28.710
 yeast bottoms that have settled 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:31.740
 and precisely on the bottom then to get 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:34.260
 a more clear result permanently 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:36.600
 even if some funds will be created 

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.950
 always in the bottles however we say 

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:40.410
 let's try to minimize 

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:41.460
 I believe the taste is not affected 

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:42.270
 to the problem of only one fact 

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:46.470
 aesthetic 

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:48.450
 yes i know the funds can alter the 

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:50.820
 taste ie several limits can 

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:52.830
 alter the taste of beer with which 

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:55.290
 I think it is a minimal thing indeed 

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:57.180
 first pilsner beer we have not not 

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:59.190
 we have not made any transfers 

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:01.350
 put in the fermenter then after well in 

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:03.090
 bottle with no racking no 

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:05.310
 there were so many funds to say the 

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:07.020
 Truth, however, there were those who 

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:08.910
 there are the array up to this 

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:10.830
 beer we did we made a 

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:13.320
 we will make two ten trays 

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:15.660
 days ago another now though anyway 

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:17.040
 the pen was very good so even though 

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:17.700
 you don't have two fermenters not there 

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:20.210
 worry 

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:22.980
 maybe if you want we say 

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:25.200
 in short, specialize yourself become more 

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:28.740
 demanding and I am a pain in the ass 

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:34.700
 and so I do it here now we prepare 

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:34.700
 the saucepan with dextrose water 

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:45.680
 girl was what i call her thing 

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:56.240
 listened to loves life at the boil of arms 

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:07.940
 I do n't get the word advise 

00:08:12.889 --> 00:08:15.889
 call
