so it's my turn to try them out and see

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.860 
so it's my turn to try them out and see
how<00:04:14.840> I<00:04:14.870> like<00:04:15.019> them<00:04:15.970> the<00:04:16.970> pros<00:04:17.299> about<00:04:17.329> the<00:04:17.720> bio

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
how I like them the pros about the bio

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.240 
how I like them the pros about the bio
flex<00:04:18.199> is<00:04:18.590> they<00:04:19.100> are<00:04:19.250> flexi<00:04:19.729> so<00:04:21.039> they're<00:04:22.039> more

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
flex is they are flexi so they're more

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.159 
flex is they are flexi so they're more
comfortable<00:04:22.460> in<00:04:22.970> my<00:04:23.060> opinion<00:04:23.419> where<00:04:23.600> you

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 
comfortable in my opinion where you

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:25.890 
comfortable in my opinion where you
don't<00:04:24.289> have<00:04:24.350> something<00:04:24.590> really<00:04:24.710> stiff<00:04:25.220> and

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
don't have something really stiff and

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.950 
don't have something really stiff and
they<00:04:26.900> can<00:04:28.120> bend<00:04:29.120> so<00:04:29.330> if<00:04:29.419> you<00:04:29.510> bite<00:04:29.660> on<00:04:29.690> them

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
they can bend so if you bite on them

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.330 
they can bend so if you bite on them
they<00:04:30.080> don't<00:04:30.169> hurt<00:04:30.430> but<00:04:31.430> one<00:04:31.729> of<00:04:31.760> the<00:04:31.910> cons<00:04:32.180> is

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
they don't hurt but one of the cons is

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:39.029 
they don't hurt but one of the cons is
once<00:04:34.340> you<00:04:34.550> bend<00:04:34.729> them<00:04:34.820> enough<00:04:35.090> they<00:04:35.990> stay<00:04:36.680> bent

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:39.039 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:41.379

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
like a Cornish pink color but I can only

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.180 
like a Cornish pink color but I can only
expect<00:04:57.919> so<00:04:58.099> much<00:04:58.220> and<00:04:59.349> also<00:05:00.349> it<00:05:00.710> bite<00:05:00.949> on<00:05:01.099> it

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190

expect so much and also it bite on it
too<00:05:01.310> much<00:05:01.460> they<00:05:01.820> break<00:05:02.770> which<00:05:03.770> is

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:05.730 
too much they break which is

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:08.630 
too much they break which is
like<00:05:06.390> my<00:05:06.810> first<00:05:07.380> one<00:05:07.560> I<00:05:07.740> tried<00:05:07.770> and<00:05:08.280> I<00:05:08.460> guess<00:05:08.610> I

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:08.640 
like my first one I tried and I guess I

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.550

now under the present cons of the metal
bars<00:05:22.340> the<00:05:23.340> pro<00:05:23.520> is<00:05:23.790> they<00:05:24.240> don't<00:05:24.420> bend<00:05:25.170> and

bars the pro is they don't bend and
they're<00:05:26.220> not<00:05:26.370> gonna<00:05:26.520> break<00:05:26.700> easily<00:05:27.020> the<00:05:28.020> cons

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:28.260 
they're not gonna break easily the cons

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:29.450 
they're not gonna break easily the cons
is<00:05:28.500> if<00:05:28.650> you<00:05:28.740> bite<00:05:28.950> down<00:05:28.980> on<00:05:29.160> them<00:05:29.370> they're

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
is if you bite down on them they're

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.970 
is if you bite down on them they're
gonna<00:05:29.550> hurt<00:05:29.820> a<00:05:30.030> lot<00:05:30.480> and<00:05:30.840> the<00:05:31.560> fact<00:05:31.710> that<00:05:31.770> they

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:31.980 
gonna hurt a lot and the fact that they

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:33.530 
gonna hurt a lot and the fact that they
don't<00:05:32.250> bend<00:05:32.550> they're<00:05:32.730> not<00:05:32.850> as<00:05:32.970> comfortable<00:05:33.210> in
