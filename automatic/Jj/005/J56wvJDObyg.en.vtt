00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.490 
know you want to give them an easy
answer<00:00:11.490> so<00:00:11.820> you'll<00:00:11.940> say<00:00:12.150> well<00:00:12.929> because<00:00:13.320> it's

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
answer so you'll say well because it's

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.300 
answer so you'll say well because it's
too<00:00:13.650> expensive<00:00:13.860> why<00:00:15.049> well<00:00:16.049> because<00:00:16.160> you<00:00:17.160> have

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
too expensive why well because you have

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.179 
too expensive why well because you have
to<00:00:17.430> have<00:00:17.520> a<00:00:17.550> rocket<00:00:18.000> to<00:00:18.119> go<00:00:18.210> to<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.480> moon<00:00:18.660> why

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:19.189 
to have a rocket to go to the moon why

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:21.500 
to have a rocket to go to the moon why
well<00:00:20.189> because<00:00:20.220> an<00:00:20.490> airplane<00:00:20.820> just<00:00:21.029> can't<00:00:21.300> fly

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
well because an airplane just can't fly

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.920 
well because an airplane just can't fly
to<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.840> moon<00:00:21.869> you<00:00:22.140> need<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:22.560> rocket<00:00:22.970> why<00:00:23.970> well

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
to the moon you need a rocket why well

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.279 
to the moon you need a rocket why well
airplanes<00:00:25.650> engines<00:00:26.480> can't<00:00:27.480> fly<00:00:27.960> in<00:00:28.140> outer

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
airplanes engines can't fly in outer

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.330 
airplanes engines can't fly in outer
space<00:00:28.529> why<00:00:29.510> you<00:00:30.510> know<00:00:30.660> as<00:00:30.900> you<00:00:30.960> see<00:00:31.380> by<00:00:31.949> asking

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
space why you know as you see by asking

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.240 
space why you know as you see by asking
why<00:00:32.579> you<00:00:32.910> that<00:00:33.510> child<00:00:33.809> is<00:00:33.930> opening<00:00:34.680> up<00:00:34.800> more

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
why you that child is opening up more

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.869 
why you that child is opening up more
and<00:00:35.610> more<00:00:35.700> doors<00:00:36.920> to<00:00:37.920> gain<00:00:38.129> more<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:38.579> more

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
and more doors to gain more and more

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.670 
and more doors to gain more and more
knowledge<00:00:39.390> now<00:00:39.660> I<00:00:39.690> mean<00:00:40.020> eventually<00:00:40.230> we're

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
knowledge now I mean eventually we're

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.560 
knowledge now I mean eventually we're
going<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:40.860> be<00:00:40.950> explaining<00:00:41.460> physics<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.270> all

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
going to be explaining physics and all

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.010 
going to be explaining physics and all
types<00:00:43.260> of<00:00:43.559> different<00:00:43.739> things<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.219> this<00:00:44.399> child

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
types of different things to this child

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.340 
types of different things to this child
so<00:00:46.020> usually<00:00:46.500> you<00:00:46.739> know<00:00:47.809> well<00:00:48.809> it<00:00:49.020> just<00:00:49.050> says

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
so usually you know well it just says

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.680 
so usually you know well it just says
it's<00:00:49.680> an<00:00:49.829> interesting<00:00:50.100> conversation<00:00:50.690> but

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
it's an interesting conversation but

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.090 
it's an interesting conversation but
when<00:00:51.780> it<00:00:51.870> comes<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.140> Christianity<00:00:52.860> though

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
when it comes to Christianity though

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.369 
when it comes to Christianity though
when<00:00:53.820> people<00:00:54.090> start<00:00:54.300> asking<00:00:54.449> why<00:00:54.690> why<00:00:55.320> it

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
when people start asking why why it

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.580 
when people start asking why why it
actually<00:00:55.890> focuses<00:00:56.820> like<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.239> laser<00:00:57.600> beam<00:00:57.960> that

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
actually focuses like a laser beam that

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.450 
actually focuses like a laser beam that
why<00:00:58.980> actually<00:00:59.699> gets<00:00:59.879> more<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.719> more<00:01:00.840> tight

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
why actually gets more and more tight

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.820 
why actually gets more and more tight
because<00:01:02.460> we're<00:01:02.820> centering<00:01:03.120> on<00:01:03.300> God<00:01:03.830> usually

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
because we're centering on God usually

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.820 
because we're centering on God usually
the<00:01:04.949> answer<00:01:05.570> comes<00:01:06.570> back<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.110> room<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.590> one

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
the answer comes back to the room to one

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.130 
the answer comes back to the room to one
or<00:01:07.979> two<00:01:08.130> things<00:01:08.340> either<00:01:08.670> it's<00:01:09.000> God's<00:01:09.510> will<00:01:09.869> or

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
or two things either it's God's will or

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.620 
or two things either it's God's will or
it's<00:01:10.409> against<00:01:10.830> God's<00:01:11.010> will<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.670> that<00:01:12.299> seems

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
it's against God's will and that seems

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.149 
it's against God's will and that seems
to<00:01:12.780> earth<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.260> living<00:01:13.380> daylights<00:01:13.950> out<00:01:14.130> of

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
to earth the living daylights out of

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.800 
to earth the living daylights out of
people<00:01:14.520> because<00:01:14.760> they<00:01:14.909> want<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.330> really<00:01:15.540> have

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
people because they want to really have

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.260 
people because they want to really have
more<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.229> more<00:01:16.290> tangents<00:01:17.009> available<00:01:17.580> I<00:01:17.790> think

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
more and more tangents available I think

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.749 
more and more tangents available I think
it<00:01:18.360> offers<00:01:18.540> more<00:01:18.900> wiggle<00:01:19.200> room<00:01:19.350> if<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.520> had<00:01:20.729> a

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
it offers more wiggle room if I had a

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.700 
it offers more wiggle room if I had a
dollar<00:01:21.030> for<00:01:21.240> every<00:01:21.420> time<00:01:21.720> someone<00:01:22.080> said<00:01:22.439> I

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
dollar for every time someone said I

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.100 
dollar for every time someone said I
know<00:01:23.100> all<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.610> old<00:01:23.759> rhetoric<00:01:24.299> I<00:01:24.450> know<00:01:24.509> all<00:01:24.900> the

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
know all the old rhetoric I know all the

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.160 
know all the old rhetoric I know all the
answers<00:01:25.650> I<00:01:26.130> want<00:01:26.850> something<00:01:27.119> new<00:01:27.479> something

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
answers I want something new something

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.280 
answers I want something new something
more<00:01:28.470> exciting<00:01:29.270> you<00:01:30.270> know<00:01:30.299> I<00:01:30.450> could<00:01:31.079> probably

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
more exciting you know I could probably

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.130 
more exciting you know I could probably
retire<00:01:31.740> now<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.610> that's<00:01:33.420> kind<00:01:33.720> of<00:01:33.780> human

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
retire now and that's kind of human

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.980 
retire now and that's kind of human
nature<00:01:34.259> we<00:01:34.470> want<00:01:34.890> new<00:01:35.220> answers<00:01:35.759> I<00:01:36.060> think

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
nature we want new answers I think

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
nature we want new answers I think
that's<00:01:37.140> one<00:01:37.320> of<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.439> things

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.010 
that's one of the things

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.670 
that's one of the things
that<00:01:38.370> bode<00:01:38.670> well<00:01:38.700> for<00:01:39.510> Christianity<00:01:40.140> the

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
that bode well for Christianity the

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.140 
that bode well for Christianity the
answers<00:01:41.160> are<00:01:41.430> consistent<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:43.170> answers<00:01:43.710> that

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
answers are consistent the answers that

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.180 
answers are consistent the answers that
apply<00:01:45.150> today<00:01:45.480> are<00:01:46.080> the<00:01:46.260> same<00:01:46.500> answers<00:01:47.010> that

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
apply today are the same answers that

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.330 
apply today are the same answers that
applied<00:01:47.960> 3,000<00:01:48.960> years<00:01:49.170> ago<00:01:49.320> two<00:01:49.830> thousand

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
applied 3,000 years ago two thousand

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.010 
applied 3,000 years ago two thousand
years<00:01:50.490> ago<00:01:50.640> I<00:01:50.940> mean<00:01:51.710> the<00:01:52.710> answers<00:01:53.810> should<00:01:54.810> be

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
years ago I mean the answers should be

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.380 
years ago I mean the answers should be
consistent<00:01:55.440> if<00:01:56.010> you<00:01:56.580> were<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.760> ask<00:01:56.820> someone

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
consistent if you were to ask someone

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.420 
consistent if you were to ask someone
what<00:01:57.780> is<00:01:57.930> two<00:01:58.110> plus<00:01:58.260> two<00:01:58.380> you're<00:01:58.950> going<00:01:59.160> to<00:01:59.250> get
