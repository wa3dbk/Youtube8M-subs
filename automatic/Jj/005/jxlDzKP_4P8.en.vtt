00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.120
 ah 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.680
 when the Spaniards arrived in Cusco 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.529
 maybe the first thing they did was 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.259
 distribute land and land then wine 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.950
 that period of internecine struggle between 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:33.890
 they pizarristas and almagristas fought 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:37.680
 for example in the battle of the salinas 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:40.110
 the battle of the salinas left many 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.589
 dead some say they were 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:47.100
 honored with the appearance of this 

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:50.970
 parish the church of san sebastián in 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.219
 the just is a typical church of a 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:56.610
 reduction of Indians with their place of 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.710
 Spanish trace after they stopped 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.020
 fight the Spaniards they just got 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.100
 account that in this valley there were 20,000 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:07.619
 indigenous people who were to be catechized 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:10.440
 controlled indoctrinates and also for 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:14.039
 can get their taxes there are many 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:17.940
 churches in the cusco that are parishes 

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:20.050
 of Indians and its origin is that let's go to 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:23.140
 know the history of these 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:25.710
 in the cusco history for others very 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.710
 interesting 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.509
 it can be said that the first 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.970
 parishes established by pole of 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:42.720
 where were five around 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:46.710
 thousand 559 nativity scene santa ana san blas san 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.810
 cristóbal and san sebastián for 1,579 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.000
 the natural hospital ones were created 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.149
 that a century later was called Sanz Pedro 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.070
 santiago and san jerónimo la 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.560
 common feature is that they were located 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.479
 in peripheral locations to the center except 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.459
 those of san sebastián and san jerónimo that 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.100
 they worked more as reductions and 

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:06.899
 doctrinaire peoples although today they are 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.649
 completely assimilated into the 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.649
 city ​​of cusco 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.400
 we will start visiting san sebastián that 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.320
 maintains its doctrine structure of 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.630
 indigenous people with the church as a part 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.010
 central of the Spanish plaza the most 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.470
 of parishes were established 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.450
 intelligently near a huaca to the 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.570
 who worshiped and then associate 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:31.160
 that church worship in this case the 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.160
 Huaca would be called Sant Lluc 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.690
 input powerfully calls us the 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.400
 Attention the façade, it should be noted that 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.850
 many parishes are remade 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.850
 completely after the cataclysm of 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.850
 1650 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.160
 the funny thing about all this is that in the 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.800
 process of building towers to 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.400
 miller's bishop came up with the idea 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.819
 completely the church 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.250
 when this commissioned church was finished 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:03.909
 to the indigenous architect manuel vent 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.970
 Water 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:09.720
 the bishop came to inspect the church and 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:13.120
 he was amazed by the frontispiece 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:16.060
 saying that it seemed to have been made in 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.129
 wax just look at these columns if you do not 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:22.980
 they seem like those candles that until the day 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:22.980
 today they go out in beautiful procession 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.060
 ah
