00:00:00.519 --> 00:00:04.350

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.490
 how do kolda women kambiré special folders in the immediate the 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.649
 male condition is a buoyant theme for some time 

00:00:11.649 --> 00:00:14.789
 but while we find that there are problems specific to the stocks a 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:17.789
 been dropping out of school for example parliamentary groups 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:21.980
 obviously all have in mind rushes of ground strikes justice 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.480
 subway of the defeat of extremists and groups of men and 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.239
 masculinists post relevant questions 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:30.739
 tonight we wonder if we're listening afp 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:31.949
 groups of men 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.980
 this development to have led to safe avoid the worst 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.510
 real estate speaks and it is both a very good sport debate 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.530
 it's the one where you can notice even in a muscular way they did not hit 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.380
 in a way not small 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.440
 2nd match we appreciate several known areas that actually appear 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.340
 we have men at his side 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.500
 all will be declined then we note two women because this value and it is 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.900
 not having tried 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.880
 a debate being certainly but not to plead to take stock in the north 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.690
 enough to listen to the flames ariane emond reporters that a humbug 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.680
 Hélène Pedneault 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.070
 columnist at the issue of breaches to inspect cadets 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.180
 resume at 19 hours and in the points listen 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.630
 it's great since macaq list author of the machine to grind the flames 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.550
 jean-pierre gagnon director of the group's research after more than six 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.920
 month 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.270
 so we start with the soundtrack listen to us pass the men 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.700
 not therapeutic in all his shots 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.460
 as for the journalist and director of documentaries these days we listen 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.940
 many groups of men anyway 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.330
 for fifteen years we talk a lot 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.730
 happy as competent terrain abusers pension mounts 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.880
 food and now we talk about our ministry is a 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.659
 and as a cure for the bad guys in the social realm is not to say 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:50.570
 that we lose in time the costs of family the dishes are treated as 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:51.990
 secondary parents 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.150
 and in education and nothing for guys 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:55.530
 but there is worse than that 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.750
 to those who try to talk about the problems of men pays very 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.000
 dear at the moment 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.890
 after my documentary the grinding machine men who were of the type 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.240
 of magic demonstration of stink balls at my home my son was threatened 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.369
 and my wife under the shouts of minister's hamonist placards 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.849
 so I'm wondering now for those who want to talk about 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:16.209
 men's problems this will be for next time 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.209
 last year the company but too late 

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:24.989
 I'm one of those who thinks we've got them 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:30.079
 far removed and that we showed a welcome too much complacent he 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:34.310
 has passed that critics in front of the crusade in some quests and 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.969
 companies were saying it's not at all new 

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:40.900
 of several groups of men who take back his defeats public life 

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:44.819
 and who distils remarks which hands amen 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.269
 so revengeful 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:49.689
 it is rare to misinformation 

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:53.049
 on the effects of cynicism in their game 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:57.349
 she I do not think I'm here the voice of feminists further away 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:59.469
 but I think a lot of men 

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:02.289
 young people 

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:03.319
 on my way 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:04.409
 we are clear 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:06.570
 it lacks nuance that speech 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:07.739
 and who is wondering 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:08.759
 Why 

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:13.749
 the court is being granted two courts in the immediate future for remarks if tony parker 

00:03:13.749 --> 00:03:14.459
 on your mind 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:15.869
 Hélène Pedneault 

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:19.259
 that night we broke the prices of the groups of men the groups in my 

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:22.499
 countries exceeded the number of wanted men, including 113 

00:03:22.499 --> 00:03:25.499
 and especially the groups of men to which you refer 

00:03:25.999 --> 00:03:30.859
 I think for me I think men have not yet promised in Paris 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:34.399
 and then as if by the really makes them important because I am no 

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:36.639
 only in the spring of a team 

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:38.949
 they are proclaiming 

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:41.879
 cicinho to regroup between the French group 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:43.569
 she is created rascal 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:44.569
 she says 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:49.069
 the formal notice they can not be listened to by his 16th and 17th the 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:52.649
 men, that is to say, the simulations to excess these prosecutions before the 

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:57.179
 courts in this regard the hand a report of the sentence that is maintained 

00:03:57.179 --> 00:04:01.039
 to his big customers whom nobody could answer you can not 

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:04.499
 respond to birth to talk about her and I'm not interested 

00:04:04.499 --> 00:04:07.629
 but men be with whom contacted and we will finish this first 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:10.870
 turn the younger of the cushions pierre gagnon wondering that we do not listen 

00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:15.729
 pass the golden boys I think to continue when we think that 

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:21.299
 but we talk about the mabawa of tons more than it is the two men 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:24.340
 proceeding including tasty promoters two processions were 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.629
 suicide 

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:29.800
 please note that other things a bit more over the last 20 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.259
 years these two weeks of a hard 

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:34.090
 his club follows 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:35.509
 sounded for him 

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:37.229
 if you like the blog 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:40.309

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.300
 the game happen it's in the right places the men of david moyes who 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.469
 have fallen on it like a bar in his amber hotel though police 

00:04:58.159 --> 00:05:01.629
 by the way not need them in a Christmas market rest of two a 

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:03.550
 grouping to read for two 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.979
 of fear and the unknown woman the decline of the average hunger to win a shot 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:10.490
 sparkle launched following approval 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.650
 comfort of safety and better communication with 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.230

 this is going to be a little in cans at the machined premises did not finish s 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.720

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:27.010
 suicide in quebec 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:30.010
 really very much especially in the tragedy 

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:34.370
 already sentenced to death with this 6th pro by a passerby 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:37.690
 and then I find that the whole of Quebec should be mobilized to 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:40.150
 try to save these events some things 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.150
 but what I want to know is an information stand in mind 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:45.380
 the accused and the women 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.740
 the managers of this Swiss factory 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:52.530
 we must now to the people that nobody would have dared to face it 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:54.349

 you are not unaware that the gap after the successes of men and 

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.139
 women and not at all something very simple 

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:10.249
