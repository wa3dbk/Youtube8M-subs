greenhouse<00:00:19.620> right<00:00:19.740> behind<00:00:20.130> us<00:00:20.370> so<00:00:21.000> what<00:00:21.210> was

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:21.360 
greenhouse right behind us so what was

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.730 
greenhouse right behind us so what was
the<00:00:21.480> whole<00:00:21.600> impetus<00:00:21.900> of<00:00:22.140> this<00:00:22.350> greenhouse

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
the whole impetus of this greenhouse

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.830 
the whole impetus of this greenhouse
because<00:00:23.160> it's<00:00:23.370> it's<00:00:23.910> not<00:00:24.120> like<00:00:24.270> it<00:00:24.390> was<00:00:24.510> a<00:00:24.540> kit

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
because it's it's not like it was a kit

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.690 
because it's it's not like it was a kit
but<00:00:25.140> it<00:00:25.260> looks<00:00:25.410> like<00:00:25.560> it<00:00:25.680> was<00:00:25.770> kind<00:00:25.980> of<00:00:26.130> from

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:26.700 
but it looks like it was kind of from

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.300 
but it looks like it was kind of from
found<00:00:27.000> objects<00:00:27.480> it's<00:00:28.200> it's<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.590> collection<00:00:28.950> of

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
found objects it's it's a collection of

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.460 
found objects it's it's a collection of
things<00:00:29.670> that<00:00:30.000> over<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.720> years<00:00:30.990> I<00:00:31.320> have

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
things that over the years I have

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.790 
things that over the years I have
accumulated<00:00:31.860> and<00:00:32.690> finally<00:00:33.690> was<00:00:34.440> able<00:00:34.469> to

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
accumulated and finally was able to

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.830 
accumulated and finally was able to
build<00:00:35.220> something<00:00:35.880> that<00:00:36.000> I<00:00:36.030> had<00:00:36.300> wanted<00:00:36.510> for

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
build something that I had wanted for

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.450 
build something that I had wanted for
years<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.320> that's<00:00:37.440> like<00:00:37.650> a<00:00:37.680> potting<00:00:38.100> shed<00:00:38.310> or

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
years and that's like a potting shed or

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.940 
years and that's like a potting shed or
a<00:00:38.520> greenhouse<00:00:38.880> yeah<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:39.960> is<00:00:40.079> so<00:00:40.440> great<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:40.860> I

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
a greenhouse yeah it is so great and I

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.319 
a greenhouse yeah it is so great and I
know<00:00:40.980> some<00:00:41.310> of<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.489> pieces<00:00:41.850> have<00:00:41.940> come<00:00:42.180> from

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
know some of the pieces have come from

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.970 
know some of the pieces have come from
remodels<00:00:42.900> of<00:00:43.020> your<00:00:43.110> home<00:00:43.290> or<00:00:43.620> some<00:00:43.770> from

remodels of your home or some from
friends<00:00:44.340> homes<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:44.850> even<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.180> fence<00:00:45.390> behind

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
friends homes and even the fence behind

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.139 
friends homes and even the fence behind
us<00:00:45.960> is<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.200> window<00:00:46.620> in<00:00:46.770> it<00:00:46.890> from<00:00:47.550> your<00:00:47.700> home<00:00:47.850> so

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
us is a window in it from your home so

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.479 
us is a window in it from your home so
it<00:00:48.329> really<00:00:48.600> all<00:00:48.720> comes<00:00:48.899> together<00:00:49.170> it<00:00:49.860> does<00:00:50.100> it

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
it really all comes together it does it

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.330 
it really all comes together it does it
does<00:00:50.700> in<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.149> there<00:00:51.570> are<00:00:51.630> things<00:00:51.840> that<00:00:51.960> I<00:00:52.560> have

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
does in and there are things that I have

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.160 
does in and there are things that I have
saved<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.450> I<00:00:54.510> felt<00:00:54.750> that<00:00:54.870> we<00:00:55.020> could

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
saved and I felt that we could

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.569 
saved and I felt that we could
incorporate<00:00:55.440> it<00:00:55.800> into<00:00:55.950> something<00:00:56.430> but<00:00:56.550> I

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
incorporate it into something but I

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.940 
incorporate it into something but I
never<00:00:56.820> knew<00:00:57.000> what<00:00:57.270> finally<00:00:58.230> this<00:00:58.410> last<00:00:58.649> summer

00:00:58.940 --> 00:00:58.950 
never knew what finally this last summer

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.410 
never knew what finally this last summer
was<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.280> year<00:00:59.550> that<00:00:59.760> it<00:00:59.850> all<00:00:59.970> came<00:01:00.210> together

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
was the year that it all came together

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.110 
was the year that it all came together
as<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.840> as<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.380> nice<00:01:01.680> shed<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.640> fence

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
as a as a nice shed and and fence

all<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.990> construction<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.710> engineering<00:01:14.280> of

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
all the construction the engineering of

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.270 
all the construction the engineering of
it<00:01:14.670> I<00:01:14.909> didn't<00:01:15.750> I<00:01:15.960> I<00:01:16.229> have<00:01:16.440> a<00:01:16.470> friend<00:01:16.830> who<00:01:17.070> has

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280

done<00:01:17.880> a<00:01:17.909> wonderful<00:01:18.270> job<00:01:18.540> on<00:01:18.960> bringing<00:01:19.110> a<00:01:19.409> lot

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
done a wonderful job on bringing a lot

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.420 
done a wonderful job on bringing a lot
of<00:01:19.590> these<00:01:19.799> parts<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.549> pieces<00:01:20.729> together<00:01:22.430> he

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
of these parts and pieces together he

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.520 
of these parts and pieces together he
would<00:01:23.940> stand<00:01:24.210> back<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:25.110> I<00:01:25.200> would<00:01:25.380> say

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
would stand back and and I would say

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.039 
would stand back and and I would say
okay<00:01:25.770> here's<00:01:25.979> all<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.250> windows<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:27.060> in<00:01:27.840> most

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
okay here's all the windows and in most

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.780 
okay here's all the windows and in most
cases<00:01:28.320> he<00:01:28.590> would<00:01:28.710> he<00:01:28.979> would<00:01:29.100> find<00:01:29.369> places<00:01:29.610> for

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
cases he would he would find places for

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.370 
cases he would he would find places for
everything<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.570> he<00:01:31.080> would<00:01:31.229> do<00:01:31.350> the

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
everything and he would do the

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.770 
everything and he would do the
engineering<00:01:32.070> in<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.280> building<00:01:32.640> because<00:01:33.600> it's

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
engineering in the building because it's

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.510 
engineering in the building because it's
very<00:01:33.869> sturdy<00:01:34.260> and<00:01:34.409> it's<00:01:34.770> so<00:01:34.920> nice<00:01:35.100> because

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
very sturdy and it's so nice because

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.950 
very sturdy and it's so nice because
there<00:01:35.700> is<00:01:35.820> so<00:01:36.000> much<00:01:36.119> light<00:01:36.420> in<00:01:36.600> it<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:36.900> you

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
there is so much light in it and you

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.140 
there is so much light in it and you
could<00:01:37.110> even<00:01:37.260> use<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:37.799> other<00:01:38.250> things<00:01:38.700> like<00:01:38.909> your

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
could even use it other things like your

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.960 
could even use it other things like your
grandkids<00:01:39.600> use<00:01:39.720> it<00:01:39.869> for<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.049> playhouse<00:01:40.320> or

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
grandkids use it for a playhouse or

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.670 
grandkids use it for a playhouse or
starting<00:01:41.970> seeds<00:01:42.270> what<00:01:42.570> other<00:01:42.689> kind<00:01:43.110> of<00:01:43.229> uses

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
starting seeds what other kind of uses

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.230 
starting seeds what other kind of uses
are<00:01:43.799> you<00:01:43.890> gonna<00:01:44.010> have<00:01:44.189> I<00:01:44.460> think<00:01:44.640> starting

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
are you gonna have I think starting

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.780 
are you gonna have I think starting
seeds<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:46.229> I<00:01:46.560> want<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.070> do<00:01:47.189> some<00:01:47.400> cuttings

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
seeds and I want to do some cuttings

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.880 
seeds and I want to do some cuttings
hardwood<00:01:48.570> cuttings<00:01:48.780> this<00:01:49.140> winter<00:01:49.439> you<00:01:49.770> know

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
hardwood cuttings this winter you know

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.219 
hardwood cuttings this winter you know
I'll<00:01:50.159> start<00:01:50.400> them<00:01:50.640> in<00:01:50.759> here<00:01:50.880> as<00:01:51.000> well<00:01:51.180> so<00:01:51.479> dick

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
I'll start them in here as well so dick

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.140 
I'll start them in here as well so dick
if<00:01:52.380> we<00:01:52.619> wanted<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:53.189> tackle<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:53.610> project<00:01:53.790> like

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
if we wanted to tackle a project like

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:55.580 
if we wanted to tackle a project like
this<00:01:54.299> can<00:01:54.360> you<00:01:54.570> give<00:01:54.780> us<00:01:54.900> maybe<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.170> starting

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
this can you give us maybe a starting

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.640 
this can you give us maybe a starting
point<00:01:55.830> what<00:01:56.400> would<00:01:56.549> we<00:01:56.670> start<00:01:56.880> at<00:01:57.060> I<00:01:57.409> think<00:01:58.409> the

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650 
point what would we start at I think the

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.560 
point what would we start at I think the
most<00:01:58.799> important<00:01:59.310> thing<00:01:59.490> is<00:01:59.670> is<00:01:59.880> where<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.299> cite

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
most important thing is is where to cite

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.050 
most important thing is is where to cite
the

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
the

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.520 
the
construction<00:02:03.060> in<00:02:03.210> your<00:02:03.240> your<00:02:03.810> property<00:02:04.350> in

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
construction in your your property in

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.290 
construction in your your property in
this<00:02:04.649> case<00:02:04.920> we<00:02:05.340> wanted<00:02:06.140> enough<00:02:07.140> sun<00:02:07.470> exposure

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
this case we wanted enough sun exposure

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.850 
this case we wanted enough sun exposure
so<00:02:09.300> that<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.720> way<00:02:09.840> we<00:02:10.050> fronted<00:02:10.500> it<00:02:10.619> we'd<00:02:10.800> have

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
so that the way we fronted it we'd have

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.400 
so that the way we fronted it we'd have
enough<00:02:11.250> windows<00:02:11.580> and<00:02:11.760> enough<00:02:11.940> light<00:02:12.410> during

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
enough windows and enough light during

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.110 
enough windows and enough light during
the<00:02:13.440> day<00:02:14.630> we<00:02:15.630> were<00:02:15.780> limited<00:02:16.260> in<00:02:16.380> some<00:02:16.620> cases

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
the day we were limited in some cases

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.120 
the day we were limited in some cases
with<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.209> materials<00:02:18.660> that<00:02:18.720> we<00:02:18.900> did<00:02:19.110> have<00:02:19.319> the

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
with the materials that we did have the

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.150 
with the materials that we did have the
front<00:02:20.459> posts<00:02:20.910> are<00:02:21.030> large<00:02:21.900> beams<00:02:22.319> set<00:02:23.010> in

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
front posts are large beams set in

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.229 
front posts are large beams set in
concrete<00:02:23.840> the<00:02:24.840> back<00:02:25.019> posts<00:02:25.410> were<00:02:25.560> shorter<00:02:26.239> so

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
concrete the back posts were shorter so

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.860 
concrete the back posts were shorter so
we<00:02:27.390> had<00:02:27.599> to<00:02:27.930> we<00:02:28.319> set<00:02:28.560> them<00:02:28.769> and<00:02:28.920> gravel<00:02:29.370> and<00:02:29.870> a

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
we had to we set them and gravel and a

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.630 
we had to we set them and gravel and a
lot<00:02:31.319> just<00:02:31.500> depends<00:02:31.920> on<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.099> materials<00:02:32.550> you

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
lot just depends on the materials you

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.460 
lot just depends on the materials you
have<00:02:32.849> at<00:02:33.060> hand<00:02:33.209> I<00:02:33.480> didn't<00:02:33.750> want<00:02:33.900> to<00:02:33.989> buy<00:02:34.170> a<00:02:34.200> lot

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
have at hand I didn't want to buy a lot

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.270 
have at hand I didn't want to buy a lot
of<00:02:34.500> new<00:02:34.709> materials<00:02:35.250> so<00:02:35.730> a<00:02:35.760> lot<00:02:36.060> of<00:02:36.090> it<00:02:36.360> we<00:02:36.569> would

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
of new materials so a lot of it we would

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.979 
of new materials so a lot of it we would
source<00:02:38.280> from<00:02:38.519> things<00:02:38.760> I<00:02:38.940> did<00:02:39.150> have<00:02:39.360> and<00:02:39.810> then

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
source from things I did have and then

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.660 
source from things I did have and then
if<00:02:40.260> we<00:02:40.380> needed<00:02:40.590> more<00:02:40.799> things<00:02:41.069> we'd<00:02:41.280> go<00:02:41.430> to<00:02:41.489> one

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
if we needed more things we'd go to one

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.699 
if we needed more things we'd go to one
of<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:41.819> rebuilding<00:02:42.239> centers<00:02:42.660> ah<00:02:42.840> so<00:02:43.500> you<00:02:43.560> are

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
of the rebuilding centers ah so you are

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.550 
of the rebuilding centers ah so you are
using<00:02:43.920> on<00:02:44.330> other<00:02:45.330> recycled<00:02:45.989> things<00:02:46.140> which<00:02:46.410> is

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
using on other recycled things which is

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.620 
using on other recycled things which is
great<00:02:46.769> and<00:02:47.099> I<00:02:47.519> did<00:02:47.700> notice<00:02:47.940> speaking<00:02:48.569> of

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
great and I did notice speaking of

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.330 
great and I did notice speaking of
gravel<00:02:48.989> that<00:02:49.019> you<00:02:49.230> just<00:02:49.380> have<00:02:49.560> a<00:02:49.590> gravel<00:02:50.040> floor

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
gravel that you just have a gravel floor

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.400 
gravel that you just have a gravel floor
which<00:02:50.610> is<00:02:50.760> so<00:02:50.940> nice<00:02:51.150> it<00:02:51.510> expense<00:02:52.019> it's<00:02:52.200> a<00:02:52.260> very

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
which is so nice it expense it's a very

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.380 
which is so nice it expense it's a very
expensive<00:02:52.590> pour<00:02:53.069> concrete<00:02:53.220> so<00:02:54.060> it's<00:02:54.180> nice<00:02:54.360> to

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
expensive pour concrete so it's nice to

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:55.780 
expensive pour concrete so it's nice to
have<00:02:54.569> just<00:02:54.660> gravel<00:02:55.080> as<00:02:55.170> a<00:02:55.200> footing<00:02:55.590> or<00:02:55.739> a

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
have just gravel as a footing or a

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.309 
have just gravel as a footing or a
surface<00:02:56.790> it's<00:02:57.120> one<00:02:57.390> of<00:02:57.480> the<00:02:57.540> recommendations

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
surface it's one of the recommendations

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.979 
surface it's one of the recommendations
and<00:02:58.470> it's<00:02:58.620> best<00:02:58.860> for<00:02:59.040> drainage<00:02:59.569> and<00:03:00.569> it's<00:03:00.810> easy

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
and it's best for drainage and it's easy

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.440 
and it's best for drainage and it's easy
to<00:03:01.170> maintain<00:03:01.370> that's<00:03:02.370> nice<00:03:02.580> so<00:03:02.849> can<00:03:03.120> you<00:03:03.180> put<00:03:03.390> a

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
to maintain that's nice so can you put a

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.690 
to maintain that's nice so can you put a
price<00:03:03.720> on<00:03:03.930> what<00:03:04.200> this<00:03:04.349> cost<00:03:04.560> like<00:03:04.890> hard<00:03:05.430> money

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
price on what this cost like hard money

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.360 
price on what this cost like hard money
that<00:03:05.910> you<00:03:06.000> actually<00:03:06.180> had<00:03:06.450> to<00:03:06.510> put<00:03:06.690> out<00:03:06.810> to<00:03:07.799> make

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
that you actually had to put out to make

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.599 
that you actually had to put out to make
it<00:03:09.230> probably<00:03:10.230> the<00:03:10.320> total<00:03:10.500> material<00:03:10.799> cost<00:03:11.370> the

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.609 
it probably the total material cost the

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:14.390 
it probably the total material cost the
most<00:03:11.760> expensive<00:03:12.239> was<00:03:12.540> the<00:03:12.690> roofing<00:03:13.079> I<00:03:13.400> think

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
most expensive was the roofing I think

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.830 
most expensive was the roofing I think
probably<00:03:14.609> altogether<00:03:14.880> maybe<00:03:15.420> four<00:03:15.720> or<00:03:15.750> five

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
probably altogether maybe four or five

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.140 
probably altogether maybe four or five
hundred<00:03:16.079> dollars<00:03:16.530> for<00:03:16.560> materials<00:03:17.190> and<00:03:17.910> many

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
hundred dollars for materials and many

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.509 
hundred dollars for materials and many
years<00:03:18.450> of<00:03:18.660> saving<00:03:19.049> pieces<00:03:19.500> and<00:03:19.859> lots<00:03:20.220> and<00:03:20.400> lots

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
years of saving pieces and lots and lots

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.970 
years of saving pieces and lots and lots
of<00:03:20.819> stuff<00:03:21.090> in<00:03:21.209> the<00:03:21.359> yard<00:03:21.650> and<00:03:22.650> I<00:03:22.769> finally

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
of stuff in the yard and I finally

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.470 
of stuff in the yard and I finally
decided<00:03:23.459> that<00:03:23.609> a<00:03:23.760> lot<00:03:23.910> of<00:03:23.940> this<00:03:24.120> had<00:03:24.269> to<00:03:24.299> go

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
decided that a lot of this had to go

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.479 
decided that a lot of this had to go
into<00:03:24.750> a<00:03:24.780> project<00:03:25.079> and<00:03:25.560> anything<00:03:26.310> that<00:03:26.340> I

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
into a project and anything that I

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.400 
into a project and anything that I
didn't<00:03:26.910> use<00:03:26.940> then<00:03:27.390> I<00:03:27.420> would<00:03:27.720> turn<00:03:27.900> around<00:03:28.200> and

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
didn't use then I would turn around and
