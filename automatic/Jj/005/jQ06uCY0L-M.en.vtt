00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:08.309
 It's the last time I photographed . 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.780
 Now just one person I talk to a lot of arguments mappakyi forgot taken as a whole 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:14.299
 Let's try it. 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:18.330
 I told the people I photographed far in one piece so internet sites 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:20.490
 So I take a look at the shopping is so much wander around on the internet again-no 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.669
 This brings out the good can I take a lot 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.359
 Most of the time, there are a lot of textbooks, of course. 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:28.740
 No 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:32.369
 But I do not have to do everything I want to do with public relations . 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:36.840
 How do I do it? The first thing I'm talking about is having a sympathetic object. 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.010
 Having a character and sympathy has to be more natural and more conversation 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.520
 Be done 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:46.590
 When geuraeteul's talk that can take pictures of people naturally 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:50.399
 The second one is why you are dying. 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:55.519
 The beauty of a clean town or breathing 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:01:00.359
 In this village they have such a clean and tidy can not possibly come guilt die cast 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:01:04.379
 Images are just some kind of effect that can make a lot of lenses . 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:09.420
 The next third is the portrait - it's all. 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.890
 Initially, only taking pictures makge going to jog it increasingly getting a thousand chariots share figures 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.920
 Let's get to the side. 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:18.330
 Let's not be shy and let's get close. 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:23.730
 When you do that, you can get a better picture . 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:27.720
 Then the fourth focus is on the eye. 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:32.370
 When I take a picture of a mission, I do not see how the eye can be focused . 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:35.880
 I do not have power without knowing something i'll have a lot of answers I might look pictures 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:39.780
 Eyes must be love exactly 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:43.710
 If you do artificial lighting, this sunlight or your child will hit you in the studio. 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.800
 What was there in the old days when the old Snow Cat in the south to John Wright 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:51.810
 When you capture Q-Lite , 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:55.409
 This also glows when I go out just two trillion people If the opportunity is offline 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:58.619
 Among the contents I would like to teach at 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:02.039
 We then give geonya lighting yo Comments are contentious Employees him say geonya 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:04.079
 I can not louder than words so he gonna explain that it should see 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:07.049
 One day I'll have a chance yogeo 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:11.430
 Here's the tail I said I got four big things 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:14.879
 So I once ran a classified, then the more important thing is to mwonyamyeon 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:17.910
 I mean, you have to take a lot of pictures. 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:21.390
 When you take a picture of a photographer or a photographer 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:26.819
 Uh, mostly, I have these words. 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:30.209
 If possible, I do not always sympathize with it. 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:33.959
 It's similar nowadays, so what should I say? 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:37.079
 I'll meet you further towards reducing the number of iso film or digital is reduced ttokgatjyo 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:40.260
 It's the same influence over the water. 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:44.280
 It might be right or wrong because it's going to the viscosity side. 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:49.110
 It's a vest. I mean, it's a contrast or contrast. 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:52.920
 The photograph is in fact an open vest jjokkeum bodameun strong contrast 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:56.760
 In soft taste, we can see a little more ahead . Particles are a little rough. 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:03:01.200
 Is this either, but now there is going to talk about equal front and back of the coin 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:06.420
 I usually choose black and white photos 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:09.030
 When you take a picture of the introduction to the contents of the textbook, 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:12.900
 What's sometimes took more than 100 films old 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:16.829
 In black and white photography, because of its gradient-rich gradient remodeling 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.120
 Then things that flow to Joe were better to highlight the intro photo 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:22.950
 I'm talking about. 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:26.220
 You guys are digital but you know that film or digital has some electronic 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:30.750
 The only difference is whether it's chemical or chemical. 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.709
 Characteristics are almost like you see Can I suffered from the data whether it exported motto 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.340
 It is not. 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:39.599
 You can always see the boundaries of the connected analogue 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:43.530
 It 's like a potato. 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:47.400
 This indicator'm tough going the wrong parts that are switched 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:51.239
 I'm a little more in line with the more abundant kite 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.139
 402 I do not know how much I like it. 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:56.340
 Give you 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:59.819
 The next time you reach the 8th floor, you get 85mm from the first class 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:03.389
 I recommend it to you longer than this 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:08.280
 It is difficult to communicate with the subject and communication is a little difficult. 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:12.690
 If you go down a little more than yoga, there is a little more distortion in perspective 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:16.440
 That part of how they would occur more coming that would occur perspective 5 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:19.829
 The lens performance is also a concern and the 85mm 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:24.210
 It is not an exaggeration to say that distribution is again dedicated 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:25.590
 Then round bird's generally circular aperture 85 and slippery that the aid 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.919
 By adopting 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:33.540
 - It's beautiful. 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:37.500
 Already the image of the game sikbok yippeuda o not troublesome student Brother Lands straight 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:38.550
 Carl Zeiss lens adaptation cell Brother To follow the use of liver or collar 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.790
 There is not 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:45.870
 I am very good, Canon l lens method is good , 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:47.340
 85mm depending on the language maker young Performance performance is also stable and defined performance 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:51.660
 They're great. 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:55.620
 And then it goes up nicely, too . 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:05:00.270
 We care a lot of 9 focuses, but not a lot of focus 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:04.229
 Then when I focus my eyes , I develop the iris too, 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:05.639
 If too thin goreon the extraordinary pictures, it also intended to remind you a little bit 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:09.750
 Should not we? 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:11.700
 The aperture 1 stamina two-step tightening degree ppaek enough t after the day 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:17.190
 I can go fly yippeuge 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:20.610
 This year saw the viscosity remember I told the most important thing ahkkado Introduction Part 3 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:24.270
 It's right that you shoot the most diverse 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:27.449
 There are textbook contents and contents that negotiation is not deceived. 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:32.669
 You guys are not 100% correct answer to this 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:36.930
 But it's a way to get 1000 won at hand . 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:38.880
 Once you've heard of my lecture once, take a note at once 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:42.720
 You think about it in your head. 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:47.729
 The most important thing is what is pictured in a portrait. 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:51.510
 Lens Only Milan can be taught Let's write Let's see pictures - these parts 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:54.680
 Think once in your head and try a lot like you 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:54.680
 This is it for today . Thank you.
