00:00:00.989 --> 00:00:03.989
 There are such strategies to have stabbed 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.230
 Look out of the window 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:52.180
 Kirchardt and plants I hope not deny strikes hard 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.660
 after this 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.130
 Spahn said it has not been active and active 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:58.210
 does anyone have it? 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.210
 something is not right 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.230
 Temperatures hope that the animals are right 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.220
 all animals mammals 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.550
 and for 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.340
 to keep their temperature constant 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.040
 also Sat 1 37 degrees 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.260
 we will not go there with that 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.360
 they either have been pushed in the back of the box many have how to 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.850
 Example the freestyle mouse Olbrich and then have a nice warm 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.370
 as always you can 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.370
 a two strategies 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:33.770
 until 6 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.770
 Hibernation and Winterthur 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.190
 Grande Inter when it gets cold 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.510
 Here some animals meet in a kind 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:44.730
 Four more out 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.620
 such as 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:53.460
 He can control his temperature up to 5 degrees Celsius and regulate unused 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.850
 minimize with it 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.460
 This speech made Stone but also the many 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.469
 the marmot 

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:00.660
 the knees with 1 2 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.660
 the resourcefulness 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.150
 the «technical 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.789
 Call center clock 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.839
 this means 

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:14.639
 it is between a tree cave 

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:17.569
 to represent in the winter 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:18.929
 however, it is 

00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:21.209
 thought up several times in between 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.209
 to an infection by ticks 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.889
 his memory is not very good 

00:02:27.889 --> 00:02:29.509
 and often poisoned 

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:32.509
 Bush buried his eyes 

00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:36.179
 all changes to animals such as fishermen 

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:40.059
 and reptiles 

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:42.549
 but an interesting technique 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:45.689
 c regular their body temperature easy 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:47.369
 nothing holds 

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:50.369
 when it gets cooler like for example 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:53.569
 in the winter 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:56.569
 then that is also for Coco Kühn 

00:02:58.899 --> 00:03:01.039
 Guest stars included 

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:02.459
 Unfortunately 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.459
 you can not move so well then 

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:09.429
 Fischel spends reptiles in the grate and sets off 

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:13.449
 therefore a special copying 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:21.149
 spend winter on 

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:23.569
 simple motionless state 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:26.569
 in the cold water 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.459
 fresh crabs in the mud 

00:03:32.649 --> 00:03:35.649
 and other reptiles such as the lizards 

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:38.129
 Soups Pechstein 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:41.129
 Frostproof 

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:45.199
 no problem 

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:48.199
 when the temperatures rise again 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:51.859
 Abi also have the bodies of animals 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:58.019
 they can move more 

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:00.479
 in the top 

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:02.879
 there however the temperatures 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:05.879
 never fall below zero degrees 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:10.549
 when it falls below zero degrees 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:11.899
 Strengthen 

00:04:11.899 --> 00:04:14.469
 Wachau cook all animals to life 

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:17.329
 they now have to protect themselves against dehydration 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.609
 dry animals «How abundant I return or mammals 

00:04:21.559 --> 00:04:24.969
 I can not remember 

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:27.460
 reptiles 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:28.680
 special looking 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.279
 on the body 

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:33.169
 she 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:36.169
 protect against dehydration 

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:41.099
 but some animals had them constantly in the water 

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:44.099
 and what's around the fish or just bad 

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:48.009
 Smoking a special skin 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:50.360
 she brought my pigs 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.430
 this skin type 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.430
 she can not dry out 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.650
 therefore they can only give more in Barcelona or interest 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:02.779
 Of course all these strategies are sports 

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:05.779
 some examples 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:10.729
 there are infinitely many different ones 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:14.740
 all around the world 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.550
 Burglars use 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.279
 is a life in the desert 

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:23.539
 b not very well adjusted 

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:25.139
 why not 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:27.729
 Min there are loads of fun 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:30.729
 he was carrying a point to hide 

00:05:31.499 --> 00:05:34.499
 so that nothing happens to them 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.210
 negative again with 

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:42.629
 in addition to the audio tables factors 

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:47.469
 Temperature in the wind and routes 

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:51.349
 There are of course many other factors influencing the big ones 

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:52.689
 Stearman 

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:54.949
 to have the environment 

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:56.509
 south 

00:05:56.509 --> 00:05:58.499
 but what are they 

00:05:58.499 --> 00:06:01.499
 then take a look 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:42.059
 erotic factors 

00:06:42.059 --> 00:06:43.539
 dispute 

00:06:43.539 --> 00:06:45.449
 Vienna 

00:06:45.449 --> 00:06:46.319
 Not 

00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:48.710
 and temperature 

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:51.710
 both let humans animals and plants 

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:54.750
 no human 

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:57.750
 also cleverly influence the cabin 

00:06:59.119 --> 00:07:02.119
 that's Christmas for the first time »
