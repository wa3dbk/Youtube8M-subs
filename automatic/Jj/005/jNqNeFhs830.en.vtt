through<00:01:07.970> said<00:01:08.840> releasing<00:01:09.320> already<00:01:10.000> there<00:01:11.000> it

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 
through said releasing already there it

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:17.070 
through said releasing already there it
is<00:01:11.270> there<00:01:12.130> so<00:01:13.130> simply<00:01:13.610> detach<00:01:13.970> the<00:01:14.210> head<00:01:15.880> and

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
is there so simply detach the head and

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.710 
is there so simply detach the head and
your<00:01:18.080> contours<00:01:18.740> did<00:01:18.890> you<00:01:18.980> kind<00:01:19.160> of<00:01:19.280> go<00:01:19.400> along

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
your contours did you kind of go along

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:59.810 
your contours did you kind of go along
centralized<00:01:20.720> in<00:01:21.380> Jabbar

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.940 

but<00:02:00.820> I<00:02:00.970> know<00:02:01.210> better<00:02:01.870> than<00:02:02.230> bug<00:02:02.410> in<00:02:02.590> around<00:02:02.860> the

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
but I know better than bug in around the

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.000 
but I know better than bug in around the
perimeters<00:02:03.460> the<00:02:03.790> pre-cut<00:02:04.300> beads<00:02:04.660> just<00:02:05.650> placed

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.010 
perimeters the pre-cut beads just placed

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:35.729 
perimeters the pre-cut beads just placed
into<00:02:08.250> crystal<00:02:09.250> ball<00:02:09.399> in<00:02:09.640> position<00:02:11.910> this<00:02:34.739> okay

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
into crystal ball in position this okay

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:37.290 
into crystal ball in position this okay
we<00:02:35.950> do<00:02:36.070> then<00:02:36.280> it's<00:02:36.489> going<00:02:36.730> to<00:02:36.820> get<00:02:37.000> to<00:02:37.180> the

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
we do then it's going to get to the

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.720 
we do then it's going to get to the
right<00:02:37.480> which<00:02:38.170> will<00:02:38.410> set<00:02:38.620> down<00:02:38.650> angle<00:02:39.340> get<00:02:39.520> me

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
right which will set down angle get me

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.479 
right which will set down angle get me
to<00:02:39.880> the<00:02:39.970> wall<00:02:40.120> nice<00:02:40.360> and<00:02:40.600> square

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
to the wall nice and square

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.750 
to the wall nice and square
just<00:02:42.489> a<00:02:42.580> bit<00:02:42.730> a<00:02:42.760> water<00:02:42.970> pipeline<00:02:44.520> we<00:02:45.520> just

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
just a bit a water pipeline we just

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.250 
just a bit a water pipeline we just
start<00:02:46.000> the<00:02:46.120> middle<00:02:46.360> the<00:02:47.970> v1<00:02:48.970> like<00:02:49.270> long<00:02:49.540> what's

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260
