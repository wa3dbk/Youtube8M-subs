as<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.570> guys<00:01:24.900> will<00:01:25.049> see<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.500> should<00:01:25.770> be

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
as you guys will see it should be

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.020 
as you guys will see it should be
cutting<00:01:26.070> here<00:01:26.340> in<00:01:26.430> next<00:01:27.299> few<00:01:27.450> seconds<00:01:27.950> but<00:01:28.950> uh

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
cutting here in next few seconds but uh

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.429 
cutting here in next few seconds but uh
what<00:01:30.030> i<00:01:30.060> did<00:01:30.329> was<00:01:30.479> i<00:01:30.630> I<00:01:30.659> couldn't<00:01:30.840> repeat<00:01:31.350> the

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
what i did was i I couldn't repeat the

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.469 
what i did was i I couldn't repeat the
process<00:01:31.590> so<00:01:32.009> I<00:01:32.040> thought<00:01:32.400> I<00:01:32.610> would<00:01:32.670> just<00:01:32.909> use

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
process so I thought I would just use

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.690 
process so I thought I would just use
the<00:01:33.659> old<00:01:33.750> clip<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.229> kind<00:01:34.530> of<00:01:34.650> summarize<00:01:35.549> all

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
the events that happen and instead of

I don't really care what anyone says
it's<00:02:13.920> just<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.250> way<00:02:14.370> that<00:02:14.520> I<00:02:14.610> like<00:02:14.790> to<00:02:14.910> play<00:02:15.060> so

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
it's just the way that I like to play so

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:17.960 
it's just the way that I like to play so
obviously<00:02:16.319> i<00:02:16.410> gave<00:02:16.620> up<00:02:16.739> quite<00:02:16.950> a<00:02:16.980> bit<00:02:17.220> and<00:02:17.430> the

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
obviously i gave up quite a bit and the

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.119 
obviously i gave up quite a bit and the
first<00:02:18.180> artifact<00:02:18.450> of<00:02:18.480> 2025<00:02:19.140> but<00:02:19.440> honestly<00:02:20.040> I

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
first artifact of 2025 but honestly I

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:21.680 
first artifact of 2025 but honestly I
feel<00:02:20.310> like<00:02:20.370> we<00:02:20.550> should<00:02:20.730> be<00:02:20.819> a<00:02:20.849> playoff<00:02:21.209> team<00:02:21.420> by

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
feel like we should be a playoff team by

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.420 
feel like we should be a playoff team by
then<00:02:21.959> the<00:02:22.620> first<00:02:22.830> year<00:02:22.980> is<00:02:23.040> definitely<00:02:23.340> going

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
then the first year is definitely going

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.430 
then the first year is definitely going
to<00:02:23.489> be<00:02:23.550> for<00:02:23.819> rebuilding<00:02:24.150> and<00:02:24.690> second<00:02:25.319> year

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
to be for rebuilding and second year

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.960 
to be for rebuilding and second year
will<00:02:25.620> maybe<00:02:25.769> look<00:02:26.010> at<00:02:26.099> making<00:02:26.400> making<00:02:26.790> the

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
will maybe look at making making the

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.509 
will maybe look at making making the
playoffs<00:02:27.180> and<00:02:27.590> maybe<00:02:28.590> still<00:02:28.860> rebuilding<00:02:29.160> so

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
playoffs and maybe still rebuilding so

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:30.650 
playoffs and maybe still rebuilding so
I'm<00:02:29.640> not<00:02:29.670> really<00:02:29.819> sure<00:02:30.030> what's<00:02:30.360> going<00:02:30.420> on<00:02:30.599> yet

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
I'm not really sure what's going on yet

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.750 
I'm not really sure what's going on yet
but<00:02:30.959> by<00:02:31.050> 2025<00:02:31.650> I'm<00:02:31.950> pretty<00:02:32.310> confident<00:02:32.670> that

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
but by 2025 I'm pretty confident that

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.410 
but by 2025 I'm pretty confident that
will<00:02:32.970> be<00:02:33.120> a<00:02:33.150> playoff<00:02:33.510> team<00:02:33.750> so<00:02:34.080> we<00:02:34.620> got<00:02:34.800> yakupov

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
will be a playoff team so we got yakupov

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.910

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
a no-brainer for me on my idea what this

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.570 
a no-brainer for me on my idea what this
was<00:02:41.310> we<00:02:41.760> have<00:02:41.910> Carlson<00:02:42.450> we<00:02:42.569> have<00:02:42.690> a<00:02:42.720> I<00:02:43.580> think

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
was we have Carlson we have a I think

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.490 
was we have Carlson we have a I think
his<00:02:44.670> name<00:02:44.819> is<00:02:44.849> Jared<00:02:45.180> Cohen<00:02:45.420> and<00:02:45.870> we<00:02:46.290> have<00:02:46.380> some

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.930 
other good deef de mana and young demon
and<00:02:49.110> we<00:02:49.470> have<00:02:49.620> Craig<00:02:49.829> I<00:02:49.950> understand<00:02:50.370> that<00:02:50.640> too

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
and we have Craig I understand that too

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.240 
and we have Craig I understand that too
so<00:02:51.299> we're<00:02:52.140> pretty<00:02:52.290> good<00:02:52.530> on<00:02:52.620> that<00:02:52.739> side<00:02:52.799> of<00:02:53.069> it

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250

obviously<00:03:04.829> up<00:03:04.950> front<00:03:05.250> and<00:03:05.489> powders<00:03:06.150> and

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
obviously up front and powders and

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.210 
obviously up front and powders and
smaller<00:03:07.170> guys<00:03:07.380> I<00:03:07.410> can't<00:03:07.799> really<00:03:07.920> think<00:03:08.099> of

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
smaller guys I can't really think of

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.710 
smaller guys I can't really think of
right<00:03:08.370> now<00:03:08.400> I<00:03:08.549> think<00:03:08.730> my<00:03:08.819> Hall<00:03:09.060> of<00:03:09.209> two<00:03:09.390> if<00:03:09.630> i

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
right now I think my Hall of two if i

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.319 
right now I think my Hall of two if i
remember<00:03:09.810> right<00:03:10.200> and<00:03:10.860> up<00:03:11.099> but<00:03:11.549> our<00:03:11.790> offense<00:03:11.940> is

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
remember right and up but our offense is

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:14.930 
remember right and up but our offense is
a<00:03:12.390> little<00:03:12.660> bit<00:03:12.750> locking<00:03:13.140> so<00:03:13.440> my<00:03:14.099> idea<00:03:14.250> was<00:03:14.430> will

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
a little bit locking so my idea was will

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.410 
a little bit locking so my idea was will
get<00:03:15.060> a<00:03:15.090> young<00:03:15.360> guy<00:03:15.569> and<00:03:15.870> I<00:03:16.790> my<00:03:17.790> original<00:03:18.239> time

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
get a young guy and I my original time

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:19.610 
get a young guy and I my original time
going<00:03:18.600> through<00:03:18.690> this<00:03:18.930> i<00:03:19.109> was<00:03:19.200> looking<00:03:19.410> at<00:03:19.470> the

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
going through this i was looking at the

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:20.720 
going through this i was looking at the
draftees<00:03:20.040> and<00:03:20.250> stuff<00:03:20.400> and<00:03:20.519> I<00:03:20.579> was<00:03:20.700> thinking

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
draftees and stuff and I was thinking

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.360 
draftees and stuff and I was thinking
who<00:03:21.060> could<00:03:21.239> I<00:03:21.269> get<00:03:21.510> and<00:03:21.720> honestly<00:03:22.470> back<00:03:23.010> around

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
who could I get and honestly back around

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.009 
who could I get and honestly back around
our<00:03:23.579> back<00:03:23.940> at<00:03:24.060> pick<00:03:24.239> 15<00:03:24.389> there<00:03:24.720> wasn't<00:03:24.959> a<00:03:24.989> whole

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
our back at pick 15 there wasn't a whole

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.199
