 Athlete makes chara charles sorce 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:08.999
 Thursday at the security prison 

00:00:08.999 --> 00:00:10.109
 these engines 

00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:11.209
 every hour 

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:14.209
 it was then written afp 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.060
 then get out of bed and 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.060
 during all but sexy site 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.989
 the quality 

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:27.649
 in short it's true that this bankruptcy to social standards 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:30.649
 it's if it's my favorite family and 6 pts 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:35.030
 here is the choir 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.080
 they will be all platforms 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.430
 thanks to the restart no argument this moment it's how 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.310
 this choice that the choice the last choice was made on the lowest score 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.620
 3 the basics of this progression is strong 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.710
 little bit of this last tournament 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.850
 for the role 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.940
 the price of crude in weapons against a single time 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.880
 see which man 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.020
 the report speaks a lot 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.810
 what is the message for spending the first time 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.410
 parcels destroy the planet is done in the smallest village during the 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.590
 flight 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.590
 for me it's unacceptable it's obvious but why not 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.700
 and we can savor the skin color novak it's beautiful it's okay that's it 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.700
 goes on as a letter to the post office 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.950
 or so for him 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.660
 that's something else 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.660
 to be able to believe report 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.800
 to launch his place 

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:16.089
 I'm going to put the colors down 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:24.829
 and that's how I'm doing 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:26.579
 look at this 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:29.579
 so that's great thank you very much 

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:35.619
 bercy but can be settled 

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:44.389
 each time as 52% 

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:51.219
 it's a question to the Valais brand or hawaii 

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:54.219
 possible 

00:02:56.249 --> 00:02:59.709
 no no one will of course watch the scene 63 'mark 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:10.989
 it is in number in this world because it was a little complicated starting from 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:15.599
 procession went along the message is necessary that besides telling oneself of not 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:18.599
 not understand 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:23.849
 so for little we'll see 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:26.199
 Valerie raises the blood 

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:29.199
 sansan this opera 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:34.319
 decidedly very big bearer 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:40.879
 in this case recorded the statement me it would be great 

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:48.559
 here you want to put yourself in a field technofan boubou 

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:51.149
 beat up his youth 

00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:52.639
 messi remains elusive 

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:56.279
 2011 the finding is at this point is relative it was a very match 

00:03:56.279 --> 00:03:59.279
 stressful 

00:03:59.949 --> 00:04:03.719
