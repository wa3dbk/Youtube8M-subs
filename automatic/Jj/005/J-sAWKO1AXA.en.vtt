new hardware so we'll just let it load
up<00:00:28.380> and<00:00:28.560> see<00:00:28.830> if<00:00:28.890> we<00:00:28.949> can<00:00:29.070> make<00:00:29.970> it<00:00:30.179> as<00:00:30.449> near<00:00:30.990> as

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
those out I used to have this on the ps2

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:56.379 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:00.660 

on<00:00:56.559> the<00:00:57.100> even<00:00:57.399> on<00:00:57.519> the<00:00:57.670> ps2<00:00:59.280> if<00:01:00.280> you've<00:01:00.489> been

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
on the even on the ps2 if you've been

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.910 
on the even on the ps2 if you've been
playing<00:01:00.789> it<00:01:01.059> on<00:01:01.690> that<00:01:02.050> particular<00:01:02.320> console

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
playing it on that particular console

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.270 
playing it on that particular console
this<00:01:03.460> port<00:01:03.820> over<00:01:04.030> won't<00:01:04.420> sin<00:01:04.780> initially<00:01:05.740> that

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
this port over won't sin initially that

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.219 
this port over won't sin initially that
that<00:01:07.000> is<00:01:07.119> that<00:01:07.270> good<00:01:07.509> alternate<00:01:08.020> while<00:01:08.110> I'm

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 
that is that good alternate while I'm

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:12.630 
that is that good alternate while I'm
down<00:01:08.380> again<00:01:08.790> it<00:01:09.790> won't<00:01:11.189> won't<00:01:12.189> come<00:01:12.340> across

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
down again it won't won't come across

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.639 
down again it won't won't come across
that<00:01:12.850> good<00:01:13.180> because<00:01:13.750> that<00:01:14.080> you<00:01:14.320> have<00:01:14.409> to<00:01:14.500> get

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:14.649 
that good because that you have to get

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:17.430 
that good because that you have to get
used<00:01:14.830> to<00:01:14.890> the<00:01:15.009> controls<00:01:15.659> but<00:01:16.659> once<00:01:17.170> you<00:01:17.289> got

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
used to the controls but once you got

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.289 
used to the controls but once you got
used<00:01:17.619> to<00:01:17.740> the<00:01:17.890> on-screen<00:01:18.310> controls<00:01:18.430> I<00:01:18.909> mean

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:19.299 
used to the on-screen controls I mean

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:20.760 
used to the on-screen controls I mean
they're<00:01:19.479> the<00:01:19.720> driving<00:01:19.990> ones<00:01:20.320> are<00:01:20.470> little<00:01:20.590> bit

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
they're the driving ones are little bit

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.680 
they're the driving ones are little bit
strange<00:01:21.039> to<00:01:21.220> begin<00:01:21.520> with<00:01:21.729> anyway<00:01:22.690> as<00:01:23.049> a<00:01:24.690> when

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
strange to begin with anyway as a when

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.120 
strange to begin with anyway as a when
you're<00:01:25.810> walking<00:01:26.200> you<00:01:26.289> can<00:01:26.350> tap<00:01:26.680> your<00:01:26.710> left

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
you're walking you can tap your left

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.120 
you're walking you can tap your left
hand<00:01:28.200> anywhere<00:01:29.200> on<00:01:29.319> the<00:01:29.440> left<00:01:29.619> hand<00:01:29.770> side<00:01:29.920> and

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
hand anywhere on the left hand side and

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.730 
hand anywhere on the left hand side and
you<00:01:30.250> can<00:01:30.280> the<00:01:31.210> guy<00:01:31.390> will<00:01:31.509> start<00:01:31.720> moving<00:01:31.899> to<00:01:32.590> any

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
you can the guy will start moving to any

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.570 
you can the guy will start moving to any
direction<00:01:33.300> which<00:01:34.300> is<00:01:34.450> okay<00:01:35.130> but<00:01:36.130> when<00:01:36.460> you're

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
direction which is okay but when you're

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.580 
direction which is okay but when you're
driving<00:01:36.729> the<00:01:37.210> controls<00:01:37.630> don't<00:01:37.869> move<00:01:38.170> so<00:01:38.530> if

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
driving the controls don't move so if

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:39.930 
driving the controls don't move so if
you<00:01:38.679> hit<00:01:38.800> the<00:01:38.920> wrong<00:01:39.039> part<00:01:39.340> of<00:01:39.369> the<00:01:39.460> circle

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
you hit the wrong part of the circle

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.330 
you hit the wrong part of the circle
nothing<00:01:40.600> happens

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
nothing happens

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.399 
nothing happens
so<00:01:42.340> you<00:01:42.909> just<00:01:43.060> gotta<00:01:43.270> try<00:01:43.810> and<00:01:43.899> remember<00:01:44.080> where

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
so you just gotta try and remember where

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:46.559 
so you just gotta try and remember where
the<00:01:44.530> controls<00:01:44.950> are<00:01:45.250> and<00:01:45.490> then<00:01:45.970> you're<00:01:46.300> good<00:01:46.450> to

00:01:46.559 --> 00:01:46.569 
the controls are and then you're good to

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:56.170 
the controls are and then you're good to
go

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.170 

okay<00:01:57.130> we'll<00:01:58.130> just<00:01:58.310> go<00:01:58.490> through<00:01:58.520> as<00:01:58.940> you<00:01:59.060> can

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
okay we'll just go through as you can

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.090 
okay we'll just go through as you can
see<00:01:59.390> that<00:01:59.900> NT<00:02:00.140> a<00:02:00.170> listing<00:02:00.560> on<00:02:00.680> this<00:02:00.890> is<00:02:01.070> a

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
see that NT a listing on this is a

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.610 
see that NT a listing on this is a
little<00:02:01.490> bit<00:02:01.610> better<00:02:01.790> than<00:02:02.060> the<00:02:02.180> st<00:02:02.630> but

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:03.620 
little bit better than the st but

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.610 
little bit better than the st but
obviously<00:02:04.100> they<00:02:04.220> all<00:02:04.340> have<00:02:04.580> to<00:02:04.790> do<00:02:04.910> with<00:02:05.090> the

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:05.620 
obviously they all have to do with the

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.160 
obviously they all have to do with the
performance<00:02:06.620> of<00:02:07.070> the<00:02:07.160> new<00:02:07.280> hardware

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
performance of the new hardware

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.900 
performance of the new hardware
absolutely

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
absolutely

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.900 
absolutely
once<00:02:10.910> you've<00:02:11.030> got<00:02:11.210> the<00:02:11.300> additional<00:02:11.480> that's<00:02:11.990> my

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
once you've got the additional that's my

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.080 
once you've got the additional that's my
particular<00:02:13.910> app<00:02:14.210> running<00:02:14.510> in<00:02:14.660> the<00:02:14.780> background

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
particular app running in the background

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:22.830 
particular app running in the background
as<00:02:17.090> you<00:02:17.210> can<00:02:17.390> see

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.780 

and<00:02:23.380> hopefully<00:02:23.620> I'm<00:02:24.010> doing<00:02:24.250> pretty<00:02:24.489> right

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
and hopefully I'm doing pretty right

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.229 
and hopefully I'm doing pretty right
with<00:02:25.000> a<00:02:25.110> driving<00:02:26.110> one<00:02:26.760> sometimes<00:02:27.760> screw<00:02:28.120> up

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
with a driving one sometimes screw up

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:29.640 
with a driving one sometimes screw up
the<00:02:28.390> driving<00:02:28.630> quite<00:02:28.930> a<00:02:28.959> lot<00:02:29.140> because<00:02:29.260> I<00:02:29.470> hit

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
the driving quite a lot because I hit

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.180 
the driving quite a lot because I hit
and<00:02:29.980> miss<00:02:30.400> hit<00:02:30.640> the<00:02:30.760> controls<00:02:31.180> so<00:02:32.020> we'll<00:02:32.980> see

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
and miss hit the controls so we'll see

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.490 
and miss hit the controls so we'll see
how<00:02:33.400> well<00:02:33.610> my<00:02:34.110> fare<00:02:35.110> against<00:02:35.410> these<00:02:36.810> and<00:02:37.810> we

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
how well my fare against these and we

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:45.000 
how well my fare against these and we
don't<00:02:38.739> want<00:02:38.890> to<00:02:38.980> be<00:02:39.040> going<00:02:39.220> around<00:02:39.519> there

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.449 

so<00:02:46.500> if<00:02:47.500> you've<00:02:47.680> ever<00:02:47.800> played<00:02:47.950> this<00:02:48.220> on<00:02:48.400> the

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
so if you've ever played this on the

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.339 
so if you've ever played this on the
Galaxy<00:02:48.909> s2<00:02:49.060> we<00:02:49.450> I<00:02:49.480> think<00:02:49.720> you<00:02:49.959> can<00:02:50.080> get<00:02:50.200> it<00:02:50.290> on

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:50.349 
Galaxy s2 we I think you can get it on

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:52.830 
Galaxy s2 we I think you can get it on
the<00:02:50.409> under<00:02:50.769> on<00:02:51.340> the<00:02:51.519> iPhone<00:02:51.909> as<00:02:52.060> well<00:02:52.090> but<00:02:52.780> I

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
the under on the iPhone as well but I

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.600 
the under on the iPhone as well but I
can't<00:02:53.110> imagine<00:02:53.200> the<00:02:53.560> iPhone<00:02:54.010> one<00:02:54.220> being<00:02:54.430> any

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
can't imagine the iPhone one being any

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.430 
can't imagine the iPhone one being any
good<00:02:54.730> to<00:02:54.970> be<00:02:55.090> fair<00:02:55.239> because<00:02:55.450> the<00:02:56.049> screen<00:02:56.409> is

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
good to be fair because the screen is

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.550 
good to be fair because the screen is
far<00:02:57.069> too<00:02:57.370> small<00:02:57.629> even<00:02:58.629> on<00:02:58.900> the<00:02:59.019> s2<00:02:59.379> when<00:02:59.530> I

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
far too small even on the s2 when I

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.920 
far too small even on the s2 when I
thought<00:02:59.860> when<00:03:00.280> I<00:03:00.340> first<00:03:00.610> had<00:03:00.730> it<00:03:00.790> on<00:03:00.970> the<00:03:01.060> sto<00:03:01.390> I

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
thought when I first had it on the sto I

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.380 
thought when I first had it on the sto I
originally<00:03:02.500> thought<00:03:02.620> it<00:03:02.680> was<00:03:02.799> awesome

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
originally thought it was awesome

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.930 
originally thought it was awesome
because<00:03:04.390> the<00:03:04.599> screen<00:03:04.870> is<00:03:05.049> bigger<00:03:05.349> but<00:03:06.160> this

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
because the screen is bigger but this

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.940 
because the screen is bigger but this
being<00:03:07.209> an<00:03:07.360> even<00:03:07.629> bigger<00:03:07.840> screen<00:03:08.230> I<00:03:10.950> can't

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
being an even bigger screen I can't

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.680 
being an even bigger screen I can't
imagine<00:03:12.040> it<00:03:12.370> being<00:03:12.400> any<00:03:12.700> good<00:03:12.790> to<00:03:13.180> compared<00:03:13.660> to

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
imagine it being any good to compared to

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.170 
imagine it being any good to compared to
the<00:03:13.810> iPhone<00:03:14.170> to<00:03:14.200> be<00:03:14.409> fair<00:03:14.650> and<00:03:15.519> that's<00:03:15.640> purely

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
the iPhone to be fair and that's purely

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.130 
the iPhone to be fair and that's purely
down<00:03:16.420> to<00:03:16.659> screen<00:03:16.930> size<00:03:17.200> I<00:03:17.950> can't<00:03:18.670> see<00:03:18.819> it<00:03:18.879> been

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
down to screen size I can't see it been

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.630 
down to screen size I can't see it been
any<00:03:20.140> good<00:03:20.319> at<00:03:20.379> all<00:03:20.590> on<00:03:20.769> a<00:03:21.010> smaller<00:03:21.310> screen

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
any good at all on a smaller screen

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.630 
any good at all on a smaller screen
that's<00:03:22.329> just<00:03:22.540> more<00:03:22.720> personal<00:03:22.900> take<00:03:23.290> on<00:03:23.440> it

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
that's just more personal take on it

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
that's just more personal take on it
that's<00:03:24.640> not<00:03:24.819> down<00:03:25.060> to<00:03:25.269> the<00:03:25.359> phone's

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
that's not down to the phone's

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.630 
that's not down to the phone's
preferences<00:03:26.260> I<00:03:26.379> just<00:03:26.590> think<00:03:26.769> that<00:03:26.890> the<00:03:27.340> screen

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
preferences I just think that the screen

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.780 
preferences I just think that the screen
size<00:03:27.879> on<00:03:27.910> the<00:03:28.900> iPhone<00:03:29.349> is<00:03:29.680> too<00:03:30.340> small<00:03:30.549> these

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
size on the iPhone is too small these

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.869 
size on the iPhone is too small these
days<00:03:30.819> I<00:03:31.030> think<00:03:31.359> it<00:03:31.480> does<00:03:31.690> look<00:03:31.870> dated<00:03:32.879> just

00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:33.879 
days I think it does look dated just

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:55.140 
days I think it does look dated just
purely<00:03:34.239> down<00:03:34.569> to<00:03:34.780> screen<00:03:35.019> size

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.030 

the<00:03:55.720> loading<00:03:56.170> is<00:03:56.290> the<00:03:56.379> same<00:03:56.590> as<00:03:56.769> when<00:03:56.920> it<00:03:57.010> was

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
the loading is the same as when it was

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.559 
the loading is the same as when it was
on<00:03:57.280> the<00:03:57.340> ps2<00:03:57.640> as<00:03:57.970> well<00:03:58.950> in<00:03:59.950> the<00:04:00.159> sense<00:04:00.400> of<00:04:00.610> you

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:01.569 
on the ps2 as well in the sense of you

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:03.839 
on the ps2 as well in the sense of you
can<00:04:01.720> see<00:04:01.840> the<00:04:01.930> background<00:04:02.379> data<00:04:02.680> loads<00:04:03.280> as<00:04:03.790> you

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:03.849 
can see the background data loads as you

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:05.479 
can see the background data loads as you
getting<00:04:04.390> near<00:04:04.540> it<00:04:04.750> rather<00:04:04.959> than<00:04:05.230> just

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
getting near it rather than just

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:22.659 
getting near it rather than just
constantly<00:04:06.489> been<00:04:06.730> there

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:25.529 

we've<00:04:23.270> been<00:04:23.479> a<00:04:23.509> little<00:04:23.840> bit<00:04:23.930> scenic<00:04:24.590> so<00:04:24.949> I

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:25.539 
we've been a little bit scenic so I

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:28.450 
we've been a little bit scenic so I
probably<00:04:26.539> will<00:04:27.319> screw<00:04:27.620> this<00:04:27.770> one<00:04:27.949> up<00:04:28.099> as<00:04:28.250> well

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
probably will screw this one up as well

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:45.370 
probably will screw this one up as well
but<00:04:28.699> we'll<00:04:29.479> see

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.980 

and<00:04:45.890> Jesus

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
and Jesus

00:04:47.990 --> 00:05:00.300 
and Jesus
pain<00:04:48.680> in<00:04:48.920> the<00:04:49.040> backside

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.180 

as<00:05:00.850> you<00:05:01.030> can<00:05:01.180> say

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.760 

gameplay<00:05:05.150> you'd<00:05:05.450> even<00:05:06.170> with<00:05:06.320> increased

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
gameplay you'd even with increased

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.310 
gameplay you'd even with increased
battery<00:05:07.070> that<00:05:07.910> you<00:05:08.000> get<00:05:08.150> a<00:05:08.180> new<00:05:08.390> Galaxy<00:05:08.780> s3

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
battery that you get a new Galaxy s3

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.060 
battery that you get a new Galaxy s3
which<00:05:09.830> is<00:05:09.980> a<00:05:10.030> 2100<00:05:11.030> milliamp<00:05:11.390> hours<00:05:12.070> compared

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.070 
which is a 2100 milliamp hours compared

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.700 
which is a 2100 milliamp hours compared
with<00:05:13.220> the<00:05:13.400> I<00:05:13.760> did<00:05:14.300> find<00:05:14.540> on<00:05:14.660> that<00:05:14.720> s2<00:05:15.410> to<00:05:15.590> be

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710 
with the I did find on that s2 to be

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.890 
with the I did find on that s2 to be
fair<00:05:15.890> the<00:05:16.040> battery<00:05:16.400> would<00:05:16.730> drain<00:05:17.600> quite

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
fair the battery would drain quite

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.440 
fair the battery would drain quite
heavily<00:05:18.140> if<00:05:18.350> you<00:05:18.440> played<00:05:19.100> up<00:05:19.340> say<00:05:19.610> say<00:05:20.270> about

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:20.450 
heavily if you played up say say about

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:23.050 
heavily if you played up say say about
half<00:05:20.720> an<00:05:20.870> hour<00:05:20.990> or<00:05:21.170> an<00:05:21.230> hour<00:05:21.320> of<00:05:21.650> it<00:05:21.770> I<00:05:22.640> was

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
half an hour or an hour of it I was

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:24.250 
half an hour or an hour of it I was
found<00:05:23.240> that<00:05:23.390> I<00:05:23.420> needed<00:05:23.720> to<00:05:23.840> charge<00:05:24.080> it

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:24.260 
found that I needed to charge it
