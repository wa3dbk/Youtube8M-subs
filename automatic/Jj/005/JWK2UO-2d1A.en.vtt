00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:04.320
 obviously the best time to plant in your garden 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.819
 rest that autumn you will enjoy so the earth is still hot and 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:11.849
 destroyed autumns to ensure a quick recovery but nothing beats 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.720
 professional advice 7th day of autumn 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.930
 the most favorable time to plant your trees and shrubs will be 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:19.089
 perennials 

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:20.769
 but presumably a year ago 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:24.160
 but be careful anyway before going too far it is dry weather is nice 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.400
 wait for the first rains before going ahead in all its 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.149
 plantations the lonely 

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:30.740
 little tip today 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.710
 warn you have given everything at the end of the year 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:33.560
 stolons 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.280
 what we can also call greedy 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.870
 we will enjoy 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.170
 of this generosity of the president 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:40.940
 to multiply 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.750
 all his feet 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.149
 tracing to cut the stolt have the water level the part 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:47.550
 foot side 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.140
 you dream dressed as it is said in botany 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.610
 the end of the account we count well and you could just a little 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.400
 purpose is to be a little loam and that's the choice of plants planted 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.970
 so wide that you will then naturally go towards the one you 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.619
 like and who are well suited to grow in your garden 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:07.490
 that for example hydrangeas 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.460
 who offers us a beautiful and generous bloom during the summer be our 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.390
 thought was primed for planting so we strongly 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.270
 shot down the branches 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.480
 to stimulate the recovery of the root system 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.620
 and so we'll go and think about who I remind you is a plant 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.540
 from Himalaya 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.970
 so a very good resistance to cold as we see we have a very 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.090
 very good root system that will be slightly cleared 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.440
 in order to allow the plumb to become anchored in its new mix 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.090
 which is constituted 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.090
 of heather earth and a vegetal panenka 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.460
 all 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.240
 corresponds well to that of the courses 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.369
 we have color the language patina who thought no longer barrels these 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:50.430
 devices we do not know what to do 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.670
 but now that's it okay surfacing a watering and it's gone 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.130
 for two years in a row noted that their tension will be comfortable with a 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.319
 exhibition a re-entry meeting 

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:02.260
 it can be 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.969
 a board wait for the next ones faster 

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:06.209
 to make your plantations
