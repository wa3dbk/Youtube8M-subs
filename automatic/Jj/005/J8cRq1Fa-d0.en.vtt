00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.770 
the whole idea came around here cut
around<00:02:43.130> the<00:02:43.580> chassis<00:02:44.060> and<00:02:44.180> everything<00:02:44.600> with

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
around the chassis and everything with

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.940 
around the chassis and everything with
the<00:02:44.900> wood<00:02:45.250> cut<00:02:46.250> a<00:02:46.280> piece<00:02:46.490> here<00:02:46.730> for<00:02:46.940> the<00:02:47.030> back

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
the wood cut a piece here for the back

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.840 
the wood cut a piece here for the back
so<00:02:48.950> I<00:02:48.980> can<00:02:49.220> make<00:02:49.340> it<00:02:49.460> a<00:02:49.550> little<00:02:49.730> more

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
so I can make it a little more

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.660 
so I can make it a little more
aerodynamic<00:02:50.660> so<00:02:51.590> the<00:02:51.680> wind<00:02:51.860> can<00:02:52.040> go<00:02:52.160> over<00:02:52.490> it

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
aerodynamic so the wind can go over it

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.450 
aerodynamic so the wind can go over it
and<00:02:52.940> underneath<00:02:53.420> it<00:02:53.830> but<00:02:54.830> check<00:02:55.040> this<00:02:55.190> side<00:02:55.430> I

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:55.460 
and underneath it but check this side I

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.840 
and underneath it but check this side I
got<00:02:55.640> the<00:02:55.790> red<00:02:55.970> springs<00:02:56.510> in<00:02:56.750> the<00:02:56.840> back

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
got the red springs in the back

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.910 
got the red springs in the back
the<00:02:58.850> Entergy<00:02:59.600> progressive<00:03:00.440> Springs<00:03:00.740> in<00:03:00.890> the

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
the Entergy progressive Springs in the

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.690 
the Entergy progressive Springs in the
back<00:03:01.190> I<00:03:01.520> got<00:03:02.450> the<00:03:02.570> energy<00:03:03.700> progressive

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
back I got the energy progressive

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.880 
back I got the energy progressive
Springs<00:03:05.090> in<00:03:05.480> the<00:03:05.600> front<00:03:05.930> they're<00:03:06.350> black<00:03:07.420> okay

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
Springs in the front they're black okay

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:15.430 
Springs in the front they're black okay
