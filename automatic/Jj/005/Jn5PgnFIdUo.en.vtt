00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
electrical opponents removed we can

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.930 
electrical opponents removed we can
remove<00:00:33.870> our<00:00:34.140> four<00:00:34.380> fasteners<00:00:34.920> as<00:00:35.489> you<00:00:35.700> can<00:00:35.790> see

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
remove our four fasteners as you can see

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.090 
remove our four fasteners as you can see
we've<00:00:36.210> only<00:00:36.390> removed<00:00:36.690> two<00:00:36.840> fasteners<00:00:37.350> for<00:00:37.950> now

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
we've only removed two fasteners for now

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.950 
we've only removed two fasteners for now
we're<00:00:38.430> going<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.670> use<00:00:38.790> a<00:00:38.820> pallet<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.690> fork

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
we're going to use a pallet and a fork

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.569 
we're going to use a pallet and a fork
truck<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.620> take<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.980> weight<00:00:41.129> from<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.399> pin

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
truck to take the weight from the pin

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.209 
truck to take the weight from the pin
box<00:00:41.760> so<00:00:42.360> it's<00:00:42.510> safer<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:43.050> remove<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.800> final

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
box so it's safer to remove the final

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.770 
box so it's safer to remove the final
fasteners<00:00:45.829> in<00:00:46.829> this<00:00:47.640> case<00:00:47.910> we'll<00:00:48.239> be<00:00:48.390> using<00:00:48.570> a

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
fasteners in this case we'll be using a

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.569 
fasteners in this case we'll be using a
pry<00:00:48.960> bar<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.260> help<00:00:49.559> with<00:00:49.829> removing<00:00:50.010> of<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.399> pin

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
pry bar to help with removing of the pin

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.369 
pry bar to help with removing of the pin
box<00:00:50.789> with<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.420> remove<00:00:51.660> will<00:00:51.960> lower<00:00:52.170> the

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
box with the remove will lower the

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.560 
box with the remove will lower the
pallet<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:52.890> proceed<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.760> assembling<00:00:54.390> the

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
pallet and proceed to assembling the

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.119 
pallet and proceed to assembling the
turret<00:00:57.020> first<00:00:58.020> thing<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.350> do<00:00:58.500> is<00:00:58.649> remove<00:00:58.739> the

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
turret first thing to do is remove the

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.229 
turret first thing to do is remove the
wedge<00:00:59.370> from<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.730> bottom<00:01:00.030> of<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.239> Sidewinder

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
wedge from the bottom of the Sidewinder

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.969 
wedge from the bottom of the Sidewinder
it<00:01:03.239> will<00:01:03.449> line<00:01:03.660> up<00:01:03.690> here<00:01:04.199> with<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.500> kingpin

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
it will line up here with the kingpin

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.010 
it will line up here with the kingpin
where<00:01:05.610> we'll<00:01:05.850> tighten<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.270> down<00:01:06.330> into

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
where we'll tighten it down into

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.020 
where we'll tighten it down into
position<00:01:07.140> later<00:01:07.710> so<00:01:08.070> there'll<00:01:08.490> be<00:01:08.520> no<00:01:08.760> lateral

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
position later so there'll be no lateral

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.490 
position later so there'll be no lateral
movement<00:01:09.600> with<00:01:09.780> our<00:01:09.810> Sidewinder<00:01:12.229> what<00:01:13.229> we<00:01:13.320> set

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
movement with our Sidewinder what we set

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.080 
movement with our Sidewinder what we set
it<00:01:13.619> turret<00:01:14.040> into<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.400> Sidewinder<00:01:14.939> we're

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
it turret into the Sidewinder we're

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.370 
it turret into the Sidewinder we're
going<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.330> take<00:01:15.479> some<00:01:15.689> of<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.930> white<00:01:16.200> lithium

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
going to take some of the white lithium

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.219 
going to take some of the white lithium
grease<00:01:16.619> or<00:01:17.159> spray<00:01:17.820> lubricant<00:01:18.390> just<00:01:19.020> hit<00:01:19.110> the

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
grease or spray lubricant just hit the

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.749 
grease or spray lubricant just hit the
top<00:01:19.380> of<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.560> Sidewinder<00:01:20.100> just<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.580> make<00:01:20.729> it

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
top of the Sidewinder just to make it

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.499 
top of the Sidewinder just to make it
easier<00:01:21.240> if<00:01:21.689> you<00:01:21.780> slide<00:01:22.020> our<00:01:22.170> turret<00:01:22.439> on<00:01:23.509> once

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
easier if you slide our turret on once

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.240 
easier if you slide our turret on once
that's<00:01:24.780> in<00:01:24.960> place<00:01:24.990> we'll<00:01:25.470> install<00:01:26.070> the

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
that's in place we'll install the

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.030 
that's in place we'll install the
plastic<00:01:26.430> disc<00:01:27.170> then<00:01:28.170> we'll<00:01:28.380> set<00:01:28.619> our<00:01:28.770> top

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
plastic disc then we'll set our top

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.770 
plastic disc then we'll set our top
plate<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:29.490> bolt<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:29.850> on<00:01:30.030> we'll<00:01:30.479> be<00:01:30.600> installing

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
plate and bolt it on we'll be installing

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.249 
plate and bolt it on we'll be installing
the<00:01:31.200> four<00:01:31.560> 5/8<00:01:32.490> bolts<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.150> lock<00:01:33.180> washers<00:01:33.780> with

the four 5/8 bolts and lock washers with
all<00:01:34.380> fasteners<00:01:34.770> install<00:01:35.189> finger<00:01:35.490> tight<00:01:35.700> I'm

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
all fasteners install finger tight I'm

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.280 
all fasteners install finger tight I'm
going<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.119> use<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:36.270> ratchet<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.780> tighten<00:01:36.900> them

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
going to use a ratchet to tighten them

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.789 
going to use a ratchet to tighten them
down

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
down

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.830 
down
then<00:01:38.159> I'll<00:01:38.280> torque<00:01:38.579> them<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:39.030> specifications

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
then I'll torque them to specifications

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.480 
then I'll torque them to specifications
as<00:01:40.049> indicated<00:01:40.189> in<00:01:41.189> instructions

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.800 

now<00:01:46.490> that<00:01:46.670> all<00:01:46.760> components<00:01:47.090> are<00:01:47.390> properly

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
now that all components are properly

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.330 
now that all components are properly
installed<00:01:48.140> we<00:01:48.320> can<00:01:48.350> install<00:01:48.740> the<00:01:48.890> turret<00:01:49.190> in

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
installed we can install the turret in

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.460 
installed we can install the turret in
Sidewinder<00:01:49.880> into<00:01:50.180> our<00:01:50.270> camper<00:01:50.660> using<00:01:51.380> the

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
next we'll reinstall our electrical box

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:33.690 
next we'll reinstall our electrical box
and<00:02:24.100> breakaway<00:02:24.460> switch<00:02:32.310> now<00:02:33.310> that<00:02:33.520> the

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
and breakaway switch now that the

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.250 
and breakaway switch now that the
