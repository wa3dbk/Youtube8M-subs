00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.339
 you have to be absolutely too much 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.820
 euphoric, in short, I want to say clearly that 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:20.860
 we came from a moment 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.390
 extremely negative for which the 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:26.560
 Avellino draw a win with 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:29.890
 Cesena and this one can do today 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.529
 to think that we are on the right path 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.329
 But I'm a coach who reads the 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.519
 ranks especially when they are missing 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:39.519
 thirteen days at the end and the 

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:40.749
 ranking says that the pescara anyway 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:41.409
 late for those who were 

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:45.190
 targets 

00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:47.530
 and then and then I have to understand why 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.940
 pescara not having given any 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.979
 responsibility that preceded me 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.819
 because I know his work and I know that 

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:57.219
 it's definitely not the ranking not 

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:59.710
 depended on my predecessor not 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:02.019
 understand why this team that 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.460
 now so proactive not the state in 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:07.120
 a fairly long part of the 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.880
 championship though this is the appearance so much 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.680
 for standing on the ground, in short, a 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.810
 feet absolutely on the ground in short 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.909
 I mean why 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:20.049
 today's match like that of 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:21.820
 avellino makes us understand what the weapons are 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:23.619
 to use in this league and the 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.520
 teams that are in front of what I hear 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:30.250
 which are lucky teams 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.020
 or maybe they weren't budgeted 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.759
 there is a very clear reason why they are 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.520
 forward because they propose the qualities that 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:38.560
 it is necessary to propose in football in general 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.579
 and in this particular championship 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.890
 here is mister 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:43.149
 in the meantime while she understands then 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.250
 let's get the point of the situation 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:47.350
 seven points in three games only one goal 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.899
 immediately and then returned to the goal of 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.789
 here is what else there is to understand 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:54.520
 no there was no understanding yet so much for 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:57.100
 example the defensive attitude of the 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.500
 team when we did it like 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:03.700
 we had prepared it and now it was not 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:05.319
 I mean perfect but exemplary though 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.149
 we had not only prepared with appearance 

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:10.149
 and we were in that situation 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:11.709
 tactic to be able to then restart and when 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.440
 we succeeded as in the occasion of 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.630
 goal we did well though in some 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.829
 we don't have moments of the game 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:22.690
 done we did wrong and this gives the 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:24.370
 opposing teams the opportunity to star 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:28.030
 too in your half of the field then 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:31.000
 when there is this attitude and I repeat 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.069
 when you inevitably choose it then 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.079
 you must be aware that you have conquered 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:38.319
 ball you have to start again 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:39.609
 and instead we had some done 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.829
 too much error for everything in the first 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:44.889
 time especially in the first half yes 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:46.420
 especially after the goal that happened 

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:51.040
 already with the cesena naples 2 0 we have 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:52.510
 expressed not the worst things though 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.459
 in short, we made mistakes that 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.709
 previously we had not done so 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.400
 that's where we need to improve in 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:02.390
 awareness that 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.920
 that we are a great team and and up 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.319
 in the end who plays against us for 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.959
 win games and will have to suffer from sweating 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.159
 like today the spice 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:14.269
 the last thing what in the against 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:17.450
 Cesena especially black minutes liked 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:19.310
 today I think it's something wrong 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.290
 it's 90 minutes to read so 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.060
 positive of the complex but I am not that 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:28.730
 I want from a reading of course from 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:32.049
 coach or presumed so and then the 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.980
 mine may also seem to be an examination 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:36.590
 strict 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.760
 but I fell too many times to do 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.889
 too many compliments to my team 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:43.040
 so head down 

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:45.049
 indeed high for the result obtained though 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.700
 now a team is waiting for us 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:48.470
 dominating this championship and I want to 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.870
 understand if we were able 9 of 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:56.120
 dominate it and the opponent does 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:04:00.230
 right that saw aspects then give 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.430
 a judgment on others is always a lot 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:05.889
 very difficult 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:08.359
 I must be honest as I always am 

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:15.769
 I read today the spice was a lot 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:18.229
 limited by how we played we are not 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:19.880
 I believe the spice was just right 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:20.510
 limited because the potential is 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.610
 enormous 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:25.669
 but if you play when the spice is one 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:29.539
 some way it is more difficult to take away 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:31.849
 result therefore we have created i 

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:33.590
 assumptions to make them play like you 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:36.680
 in short, he says badly with certain players 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:38.090
 important and therefore I find it difficult today to 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.180
 give an opinion on this team 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:43.460
 because I believe without having been 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:47.419
 quite strict with my team 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:49.639
 I also think that I was quite modest 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:50.750
 that the spice will hardly meet 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:53.210
 here at the end teams that will play 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:55.340
 the competitive ferocity carefully 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.780
 with whom we played ourselves and in those 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.560
 situations does not spice up a team of 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.360
 great level 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.530
 now how do you contain it 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.620
 the enthusiasm we have as square 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:05.240
 pescara but in the meantime two days there 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:08.479
 I speak in the sense that I have to go home 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:11.500
 and marano but enthusiasm is one 

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:16.669
 fundamental component because if you don't 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:19.810
 don't help the fans live the games 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:21.530
 of their team as if they were 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:24.050
 a nice thing 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:26.360
 that is, a fan must go to the team 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.189
 at the stadium and it's coming today it's mine 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.110
 team and I know he will play in that 

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:31.370
 so I know he will give everything to win the 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:32.840
 game 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.990
 sometimes it happens sometimes not 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:38.419
 happens but the fan the real one in 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:40.250
 all pieces so can understand 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:43.520
 perfectly when a team from 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:45.169
 maximum I believe that today a little bit is 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.939
 changed in this today there is more 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:49.669
 awareness by the agent of 

00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:51.860
 pescara that can be found around 

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:55.030
 these guys because I saw them too much 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:57.130
 disappointed I have to say too much down 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:59.530
 they didn't even deserve to stay 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:02.140
 so sad in short I mean then 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:04.420
 I brought a bit of severity to be brought 

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:06.850
 also a bit of joy because 

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:08.290
 I can't live without joy 

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:11.890
 pescara also seems to me the right city 

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:14.620
 to propose the very last number of points 

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:16.590
 he had budgeted when he signed 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:20.140
 that contract after these three games 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:22.600
 answer with a number for this on the 

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:28.480
 severe I thought to make them anonymous co2 

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:31.720
 congratulations courage and move away 

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:33.900
 then I would say we can close 

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.900
 here
