00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
fire extinguisher handy and all that now

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.799 
fire extinguisher handy and all that now
before<00:00:52.769> you<00:00:53.159> use<00:00:53.579> this<00:00:53.879> on<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.299> tank<00:00:54.569> make

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
before you use this on the tank make

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.299 
before you use this on the tank make
sure<00:00:54.989> that<00:00:55.139> this<00:00:55.319> is<00:00:55.469> actually<00:00:55.889> can<00:00:56.069> melt

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
sure that this is actually can melt

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.189 
sure that this is actually can melt
style<00:00:56.699> all<00:00:56.819> plastics<00:00:57.269> melt<00:00:57.510> some<00:00:57.749> plastic

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
style all plastics melt some plastic

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.319 
style all plastics melt some plastic
just<00:00:58.350> burn<00:00:58.620> so<00:00:59.460> what<00:00:59.579> you<00:00:59.699> do<00:00:59.879> is<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.149> might

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
just burn so what you do is you might

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.329 
just burn so what you do is you might
test<00:01:00.539> it<00:01:00.749> in<00:01:00.839> a<00:01:00.989> small<00:01:01.469> out-of-the-way<00:01:01.649> area

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:02.339 
test it in a small out-of-the-way area

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:04.850 
test it in a small out-of-the-way area
but<00:01:03.209> basically<00:01:03.839> you're<00:01:04.409> not<00:01:04.470> going<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.739> need<00:01:04.799> a

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
but basically you're not going to need a

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.469 
but basically you're not going to need a
lot<00:01:05.040> of<00:01:05.070> heat<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:06.299> idea<00:01:06.600> is<00:01:07.579> go<00:01:08.579> in<00:01:08.789> right<00:01:09.299> when

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
lot of heat the idea is go in right when

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.920 
lot of heat the idea is go in right when
it<00:01:09.570> starts<00:01:09.780> getting<00:01:09.899> soft<00:01:11.360> it'll<00:01:12.360> turn<00:01:12.570> black

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
it starts getting soft it'll turn black

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.350 
it starts getting soft it'll turn black
you<00:01:13.860> start

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
you start

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.120 
you start
holding<00:01:16.170> it

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
holding it

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.610 
holding it
with<00:01:19.130> the<00:01:19.250> screwdriver<00:01:20.080> and<00:01:21.080> then<00:01:21.200> you'll<00:01:21.440> see

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:21.620 
with the screwdriver and then you'll see

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:22.960 
with the screwdriver and then you'll see
that<00:01:21.650> you<00:01:21.890> don't<00:01:22.010> really<00:01:22.220> need<00:01:22.430> to<00:01:22.490> keep<00:01:22.790> it

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
that you don't really need to keep it

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.780 
that you don't really need to keep it
very<00:01:23.150> close<00:01:23.650> this<00:01:24.650> is<00:01:24.800> a<00:01:24.860> difficult<00:01:25.310> location

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
very close this is a difficult location

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.810 
very close this is a difficult location
to<00:01:25.850> get<00:01:25.970> into<00:01:26.300> but

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.920 

it<00:01:31.270> doesn't<00:01:31.630> take<00:01:31.810> much<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:33.340> melt<00:01:33.580> it<00:01:33.820> once<00:01:34.810> you

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
it doesn't take much to melt it once you

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:36.300 
it doesn't take much to melt it once you
start<00:01:35.200> getting<00:01:35.470> it<00:01:35.590> once<00:01:35.770> it<00:01:35.920> starts<00:01:36.130> getting

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
start getting it once it starts getting

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:37.560 
start getting it once it starts getting
hot<00:01:36.340> and<00:01:36.940> you<00:01:37.000> don't<00:01:37.060> want<00:01:37.270> to<00:01:37.330> really<00:01:37.420> to

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
hot and you don't want to really to

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:38.730 
hot and you don't want to really to
bubble<00:01:37.810> like<00:01:37.960> that<00:01:38.170> you<00:01:38.290> want<00:01:38.440> to<00:01:38.500> keep<00:01:38.590> it

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
bubble like that you want to keep it

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.940 
bubble like that you want to keep it
kind<00:01:38.920> of<00:01:40.020> so<00:01:41.020> this<00:01:41.140> takes<00:01:41.350> a<00:01:41.500> little<00:01:41.680> bit<00:01:41.890> of

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
kind of so this takes a little bit of

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.010 
kind of so this takes a little bit of
practice

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.410 

be<00:01:47.500> very<00:01:47.740> gentle<00:01:47.859> and<00:01:48.369> easy<00:01:48.549> see<00:01:49.030> how<00:01:49.119> far

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
be very gentle and easy see how far

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.140 
be very gentle and easy see how far
where<00:01:49.600> I'm<00:01:49.689> keeping<00:01:49.810> the<00:01:50.049> torch

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:02:40.780 

get<00:01:54.420> hot

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.550 

now<00:02:41.330> it's<00:02:41.480> making<00:02:41.629> us<00:02:41.900> difficult<00:02:42.319> is<00:02:42.409> this

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
now it's making us difficult is this

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.589 
now it's making us difficult is this
going<00:02:42.739> to<00:02:42.890> use<00:02:42.980> fiberglass<00:02:43.370> beforehand<00:02:44.330> and

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:44.599 
going to use fiberglass beforehand and

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:47.530 
going to use fiberglass beforehand and
that<00:02:44.659> resin<00:02:45.470> doesn't<00:02:45.799> melt<00:02:46.040> so<00:02:46.400> I<00:02:46.700> kind<00:02:47.510> of

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
that resin doesn't melt so I kind of

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:55.620 
that resin doesn't melt so I kind of
have<00:02:47.659> to<00:02:47.720> patch<00:02:47.989> around<00:02:48.200> it<00:02:48.680> a<00:02:48.769> little<00:02:48.950> bit

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.230 

now

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
now

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.630 
now
hmm<00:02:57.990> I'm<00:02:58.800> gonna<00:02:58.980> stop<00:02:59.190> there<00:02:59.430> and<00:02:59.580> just

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
hmm I'm gonna stop there and just

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.380 
hmm I'm gonna stop there and just
explain<00:03:00.110> so<00:03:01.110> this<00:03:01.350> is<00:03:02.280> a<00:03:02.340> fairly<00:03:02.610> simple<00:03:02.940> you

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
explain so this is a fairly simple you

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.270 
explain so this is a fairly simple you
don't<00:03:04.020> really<00:03:04.170> need<00:03:04.350> to<00:03:04.410> weld<00:03:04.770> kind<00:03:05.100> of<00:03:05.190> a

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
don't really need to weld kind of a

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.970 
don't really need to weld kind of a
repair<00:03:05.760> you<00:03:06.480> can<00:03:06.600> just<00:03:06.780> blend<00:03:06.990> if<00:03:07.740> you're

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
repair you can just blend if you're

welders<00:03:10.410> you<00:03:11.370> may<00:03:11.550> need<00:03:11.790> to<00:03:11.940> use<00:03:11.970> a<00:03:12.090> plastic

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
welders you may need to use a plastic

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.500 
welders you may need to use a plastic
welder<00:03:12.960> in<00:03:13.230> order<00:03:13.590> to<00:03:13.740> really<00:03:13.980> to<00:03:14.970> be<00:03:15.300> more

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
welder in order to really to be more

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.240 
welder in order to really to be more
effective<00:03:15.870> sometimes<00:03:16.050> this<00:03:16.920> one<00:03:17.130> I'll

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
effective sometimes this one I'll

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.780 
effective sometimes this one I'll
continue<00:03:17.690> and<00:03:18.690> blending<00:03:19.470> it<00:03:19.620> in<00:03:19.800> and<00:03:20.040> sealing

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
continue and blending it in and sealing

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.800 
continue and blending it in and sealing
the<00:03:20.910> crack<00:03:21.240> it<00:03:22.080> should<00:03:22.350> work<00:03:23.210> pretty<00:03:24.210> well<00:03:24.360> and

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
the crack it should work pretty well and

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.480 
the crack it should work pretty well and
then<00:03:25.350> I'm<00:03:25.500> going<00:03:25.680> to<00:03:25.740> go<00:03:25.830> in<00:03:26.040> and<00:03:26.220> then<00:03:26.340> there's

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:26.490 
then I'm going to go in and then there's

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:27.950 
then I'm going to go in and then there's
some<00:03:26.640> damage<00:03:26.970> around<00:03:27.270> here<00:03:27.480> I'm<00:03:27.570> just<00:03:27.840> going

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:27.960 
some damage around here I'm just going

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.750 
some damage around here I'm just going
to<00:03:27.990> use<00:03:28.110> silicone<00:03:28.530> and<00:03:28.740> seal<00:03:29.250> around<00:03:29.400> this

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
to use silicone and seal around this

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.790 
to use silicone and seal around this
fitting<00:03:30.660> here<00:03:30.900> but<00:03:31.230> that's<00:03:32.010> a<00:03:32.190> general<00:03:32.340> idea

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
fitting here but that's a general idea

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.110 
fitting here but that's a general idea
it's<00:03:34.800> not<00:03:34.980> very<00:03:35.310> good<00:03:35.460> if<00:03:35.550> you're<00:03:35.760> missing

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
it's not very good if you're missing

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.840 
it's not very good if you're missing
holes<00:03:36.360> like<00:03:36.600> I<00:03:36.690> said<00:03:36.930> but<00:03:37.170> you<00:03:38.100> put<00:03:38.700> this

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
holes like I said but you put this

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.110 
holes like I said but you put this
plastic<00:03:39.390> is<00:03:39.570> weldable<00:03:40.170> and<00:03:40.970> that's<00:03:41.970> the

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
plastic is weldable and that's the

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.060 
plastic is weldable and that's the
general<00:03:42.270> idea<00:03:42.600> some<00:03:43.230> will<00:03:43.410> be<00:03:43.530> easier<00:03:43.800> than<00:03:43.830> us

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
general idea some will be easier than us

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.960 
general idea some will be easier than us
alright<00:03:44.430> I<00:03:44.490> hope<00:03:44.670> this<00:03:44.910> helps<00:03:46.100> and<00:03:47.100> good<00:03:47.700> luck
