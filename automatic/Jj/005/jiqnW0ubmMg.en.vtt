00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
created this frame and I used enamel

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.850 
created this frame and I used enamel
accents<00:01:58.280> this<00:01:59.280> stuff<00:01:59.579> here<00:01:59.820> and<00:02:00.560> black<00:02:01.560> and

accents this stuff here and black and

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.670 
accents this stuff here and black and
went<00:02:02.219> over<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:03.210> spider<00:02:03.780> web<00:02:04.020> part<00:02:04.290> so<00:02:04.530> it's

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
went over the spider web part so it's

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.459 
went over the spider web part so it's
like<00:02:05.070> shiny<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:05.790> black<00:02:06.240> and<00:02:06.840> it's<00:02:07.200> kind<00:02:07.439> of

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
like shiny and black and it's kind of

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:12.229 
like shiny and black and it's kind of
like<00:02:08.270> glossy<00:02:09.270> accents<00:02:09.899> but<00:02:09.929> it's<00:02:10.940> opaque<00:02:11.940> in
