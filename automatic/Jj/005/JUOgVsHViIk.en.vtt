00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
rear their offspring the sex and beetles

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:53.730 
rear their offspring the sex and beetles
actually<00:01:52.780> quite<00:01:52.930> unique<00:01:53.260> in<00:01:53.500> the<00:01:53.619> insect

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
actually quite unique in the insect

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.270 
actually quite unique in the insect
world<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:56.229> male<00:01:56.410> and<00:01:56.590> female<00:01:56.649> get<00:01:57.130> together

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
world the male and female get together

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.370 
world the male and female get together
and<00:01:57.759> they<00:01:58.360> actually<00:01:58.390> look<00:01:58.780> after<00:01:59.080> the<00:01:59.170> young

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
and they actually look after the young

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.530 
and they actually look after the young
so<00:01:59.590> this<00:01:59.740> form<00:01:59.979> of<00:02:00.130> parental<00:02:00.520> care<00:02:00.729> is<00:02:01.000> it's

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 
so this form of parental care is it's

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.560 
so this form of parental care is it's
almost<00:02:01.869> unheard<00:02:02.229> of<00:02:03.000> if<00:02:04.000> the<00:02:04.180> worm<00:02:04.330> things

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
almost unheard of if the worm things

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.600 
almost unheard of if the worm things
like<00:02:04.720> sex<00:02:04.960> and<00:02:05.110> beetles<00:02:05.470> around<00:02:05.800> all<00:02:06.430> the

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
like sex and beetles around all the

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.249 
like sex and beetles around all the
carcasses<00:02:07.119> you<00:02:07.600> know<00:02:07.690> if<00:02:07.750> the<00:02:07.840> animals<00:02:08.140> that

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
carcasses you know if the animals that

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:09.960 
carcasses you know if the animals that
die<00:02:08.410> naturally<00:02:08.649> would<00:02:09.369> be<00:02:09.489> scattered<00:02:09.759> around

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
die naturally would be scattered around

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.520 
die naturally would be scattered around
the<00:02:10.179> environment<00:02:10.450> so<00:02:10.840> they're<00:02:11.020> really<00:02:11.350> really

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
the environment so they're really really

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.920 
the environment so they're really really
vital<00:02:11.860> at<00:02:12.310> getting<00:02:12.760> those<00:02:12.880> carcasses<00:02:13.450> varied

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
vital at getting those carcasses varied

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.900 
vital at getting those carcasses varied
and<00:02:14.140> out<00:02:14.230> of<00:02:14.410> harm's<00:02:14.680> way<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:18.310> glass<00:02:18.550> beetle

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
and out of harm's way the glass beetle

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.540 
and out of harm's way the glass beetle
larvae<00:02:19.239> I<00:02:20.100> just<00:02:21.100> think<00:02:21.250> they're<00:02:21.370> wonderful

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
larvae I just think they're wonderful

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.250 
larvae I just think they're wonderful
they're<00:02:21.760> just<00:02:22.030> great<00:02:22.300> to<00:02:22.480> get<00:02:22.600> kids<00:02:22.870> screaming

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
they're just great to get kids screaming

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.320 
they're just great to get kids screaming
as<00:02:23.500> well<00:02:23.650> as<00:02:23.830> from<00:02:24.130> a<00:02:24.160> big<00:02:27.030> there's<00:02:28.030> one

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
as well as from a big there's one

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.100 
as well as from a big there's one
species<00:02:28.660> of<00:02:28.870> mesh<00:02:29.230> that<00:02:29.530> pollinators<00:02:30.430> houses

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
species of mesh that pollinators houses

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.930 
species of mesh that pollinators houses
which<00:02:32.110> gives<00:02:32.290> us<00:02:32.350> chocolate<00:02:32.860> so<00:02:33.370> if<00:02:33.549> we<00:02:33.700> wiped

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
which gives us chocolate so if we wiped

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.520 
which gives us chocolate so if we wiped
out<00:02:34.209> this<00:02:34.390> Mitch<00:02:34.690> which<00:02:34.930> most<00:02:35.200> people<00:02:35.440> think

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
out this Mitch which most people think

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:36.990 
out this Mitch which most people think
all<00:02:35.709> a<00:02:35.739> pestilent<00:02:36.280> Mitch<00:02:36.400> we<00:02:36.549> want<00:02:36.700> to<00:02:36.760> get<00:02:36.850> rid

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
all a pestilent Mitch we want to get rid

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.370 
all a pestilent Mitch we want to get rid
of<00:02:37.120> it<00:02:37.239> we<00:02:37.930> wouldn't<00:02:38.140> have<00:02:38.230> chocolate

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.260 

I<00:02:44.410> don't<00:02:45.070> think<00:02:45.250> any<00:02:45.400> friends<00:02:45.820> have<00:02:45.910> actually

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
I don't think any friends have actually

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.090 
I don't think any friends have actually
not<00:02:46.570> come<00:02:46.780> and<00:02:46.900> had<00:02:47.020> a<00:02:47.050> look<00:02:47.260> and<00:02:47.590> then<00:02:47.800> says

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
not come and had a look and then says

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.550 
not come and had a look and then says
actually<00:02:48.970> this<00:02:49.090> is<00:02:49.210> quite<00:02:49.330> fascinating<00:02:50.140> and<00:02:50.410> I

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
actually this is quite fascinating and I

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.290 
actually this is quite fascinating and I
didn't<00:02:50.980> know<00:02:51.100> that<00:02:51.130> we<00:02:51.400> had<00:02:51.430> dung<00:02:51.760> beetles<00:02:52.150> in

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
didn't know that we had dung beetles in

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.540 
didn't know that we had dung beetles in
the<00:02:52.390> UK<00:02:52.750> or<00:02:53.140> we<00:02:53.500> didn't<00:02:53.740> understand<00:02:54.370> that

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
the UK or we didn't understand that

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.610 
the UK or we didn't understand that
insects<00:02:54.880> are<00:02:55.000> so<00:02:55.150> important<00:02:55.780> I<00:02:55.870> think<00:02:55.990> like

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
insects are so important I think like

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:57.930 
insects are so important I think like
anything<00:02:56.830> when<00:02:57.040> you<00:02:57.130> get<00:02:57.250> your<00:02:57.370> hand<00:02:57.550> certain

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
anything when you get your hand certain

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.640 
anything when you get your hand certain
you<00:02:58.030> get<00:02:58.180> in<00:02:58.300> there<00:02:58.480> and<00:02:58.570> you<00:02:58.630> had<00:02:58.750> a<00:02:58.780> look<00:02:58.960> it

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
you get in there and you had a look it

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:13.860 
you get in there and you had a look it
suddenly<00:03:00.100> becomes<00:03:00.520> interesting

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.930
