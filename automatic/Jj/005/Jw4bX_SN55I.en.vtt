00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:11.460
 equestrian club botafuegos where you can 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:15.469
 rent boxes for your horses in a 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.469
 privileged area of â€‹â€‹algeciras 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.670
 we are on the road to copper 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.670
 kilometer 0 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.880
 We have been slow to achieve putting 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.260
 march through the operative then 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.300
 we have considered that what we have to 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.100
 to do was to start and soon it will do 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.710
 an opening that as you know 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.570
 we want to do a series of little things and 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.390
 such for children and others but good and 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.989
 we are here flying that the important thing 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.269
 billing that is also important 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:01.320
 for the company and good here has 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:01.320
 many years that is the intention 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.600
 the plan is to unite both algeciras with 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.160
 ceuta as ceuta with mÃ¡laga then 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.170
 he has promoted a lot and he has bet 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.400
 a lot for algeciras in the morning to 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.740
 From seven-thirty already have 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.800
 rotations I want to remember that they are 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:24.440
 eight one and eight back along 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:27.260
 of the day and then with malaga one for the 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.790
 tomorrow afternoon then good for 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
 be operational someone who wants to come 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.200
 to work in Ceuta from 7 p.m. 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.610
 am to 9 pm will 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.119
 be with the possibility of being able to come 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:40.130
 and they will go to tell you that it is within a 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:41.869
 working hours the same for a 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.820
 next we had several options that 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.560
 are looking at the best not so much with the 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.360
 sequence of the algeciras ceuta as is 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.430
 obvious but it is true that tanger 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.840
 It is also true that for that 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.220
 operative has to be something in the 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.810
 tanger center because the airport 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.170
 famous is the portal that the idea is 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.180
 to be able to unite in the future what we 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.369
 like algeciras with the port of 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.259
 tanger that would be a route that would take 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.030
 another 10-15 minutes and as is obvious and 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:07.640
 you know, it would also be very 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.619
 tourist and a pretty pretty link 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.370
 positive also with melilla what is 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:15.709
 Ceuta would also be an operative thing 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.330
 1 1 a week better but if you make a 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.760
 round-trip rotation to a Monday 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.129
 Wednesday in the end there are different ideas 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.019
 good helicopter although it seems more 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:27.019
 fragile that an airplane is much harder or 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:28.640
 be us 90% of the jobs that 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:31.489
 we do are are all helicopters from 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.750
 emergency, that is, we have had 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.860
 in other companies what salvage 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.500
 maritime 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.959
 we have customs we have such I mean 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.700
 that the sculptor endures a lot 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.890
 for a limitation they can not be 50 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.930
 knots of the equivalent to 180 kilometers 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.930
 per hour almost hurricane and we've been 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:50.359
 going out with passengers of course this 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.819
 we would reduce it to about 40 knots but 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:54.470
 good for us to understand myself in 14 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.629
 years that I have done this line I think that 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.299
 by wind has never been canceled from 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:01.579
 service is rather when there is very good 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:03.859
 time the typical summer fog when 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:07.010
 we do not see and when it really prevents us 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:09.680
 fly but not for the time the alser 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.599
 over sea and make a linear wind is 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.069
 much safer than for example in 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:15.680
 the zone of the 'rating' of the zone of 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:18.349
 cadismo and already it becomes turbulent usually 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.430
 be algeciras thousand feet that are 300 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:20.390
 meters 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.599
 more or less to the height that you have 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.640
 come you to the right height has 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:28.040
 there was a very big study because the 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.780
 investment is huge and then it has also 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.840
 there were a series of permits based on 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:35.359
 some laws and finally it's quite complex 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.219
 the operative based on the passengers 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:39.530
 that had moved here during the 

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:41.030
 years operating head and on base also 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.489
 to encourage a bit tourism in the area 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.579
 of over all the field of Gibraltar area 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:48.079
 of the Costa del Sol to be able to encompass 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:50.090
 and unite what is the African continent 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:51.950
 with the European continent that today is a 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.019
 little bit special because we started to 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.790
 the one morning for being a party either 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:57.680
 let's start with malaga it becomes a 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.409
 schedule a little reduced and starting 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.720
 On Thursday, the 

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:04.040
 definitive schedule until a series of 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.560
 things that little by little we will go 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.940
 acquiring and the idea is to be able to 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.160
 put more flights 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.630
 the reserve operations we have put 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.760
 a page on the internet that is ceuta 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.980
 dotcom helicopters that you see 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.510
 clearly what flights are there every day 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.360
 active page can not be vueling 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:22.790
 easyjet where you can catch see 

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:25.580
 what reservations are there to see what schedules if there 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.290
 occupation if there is not and is to take 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.350
 directly the ticket the cover 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:33.140
 it's more computer and more modern than it 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.880
 it can be a telephone line on base 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:36.620
 to a security based on a series of 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.000
 laws that allowed us 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.340
 we wanted to ship that market as 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.650
 well you have been able to observe that lighten 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.870
 the operation and especially reduce us 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.250
 our costs is not to stop being 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.170
 starting and stopping what is a 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.880
 very large limitation criticized three 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:52.430
 passengers and two pilots 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:55.460
 this model admits this we're 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.840
 seeing an operation of 124 people more 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.380
 or less what you have is total and commit 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:02.090
 and everything based on our parent company 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:04.160
 which it is cat helicopter that are 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.960
 helicopter operators and they are also 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.030
 those who have done the whole study and 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.820
 what are the total shareholders and 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:11.610
 coasters was born as a project and as a 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.949
 product 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:17.069
 It is a commercial company of cut 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:19.110
 helicopters that is the central and the 

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:20.939
 helicopter at moment 1 and we're going to 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:23.189
 and if we can fill it for you 

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:25.439
 let's get many we have taken advantage of that 

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:27.539
 it's summer that is not needed in the 

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:29.340
 news in algeciras so you can follow 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:31.379
 continuing with the certification but it is 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.180
 a matter of time that they do not grant it and 

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:35.129
 what do you get if god wants it to be 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.960
 when we can get a little bit 

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:38.550
 the committed schedule of the night 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.930
 get that also in algeciras 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:42.000
 just as it has been here for many 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:45.150
 years is also achieved that can be 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.129
 take at night 60 euros and 30 euros at 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.779
 resident had a modification of 50 

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:51.330
 percent what is the path that they have 

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:53.490
 done you now we have started with 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:55.590
 some rates that believe me are very 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:57.300
 adjusted oddly enough the 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:58.800
 times that run but I know it's a 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.539
 expensive product that nobody wants 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.639
 compare with the price of the boat because 

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:06.410
 we are not competition, much less 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:09.530
 offers to offer an alternative 

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:11.000
 speed to a good trip to the 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:13.389
 people who have to come to work 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.870
 to ceuta or who want to go to the peninsula 

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:16.870
 otherwise
