take eggs on their backpacking trips or
their<00:02:26.200> bushcraft<00:02:26.800> outings<00:02:27.520> and<00:02:27.790> it's<00:02:28.750> a<00:02:28.810> good

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
their bushcraft outings and it's a good

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.630 
their bushcraft outings and it's a good
idea<00:02:29.020> because<00:02:29.470> eggs<00:02:29.770> actually<00:02:30.130> don't<00:02:30.460> need<00:02:30.580> to

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
idea because eggs actually don't need to

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:31.980 
idea because eggs actually don't need to
be<00:02:30.790> refrigerated<00:02:30.940> even<00:02:31.690> though<00:02:31.750> a<00:02:31.780> lot<00:02:31.960> of

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
be refrigerated even though a lot of

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.740 
be refrigerated even though a lot of
people<00:02:32.170> think<00:02:32.530> that<00:02:32.710> that's<00:02:33.250> the<00:02:33.430> case<00:02:33.750> but

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
people think that that's the case but

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.750 
people think that that's the case but
the<00:02:34.870> only<00:02:34.990> problem<00:02:35.230> is<00:02:35.560> it's<00:02:36.190> kind<00:02:36.430> of<00:02:36.460> hard<00:02:36.670> to

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
the only problem is it's kind of hard to

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.450 
the only problem is it's kind of hard to
carry<00:02:37.000> because<00:02:37.240> they<00:02:37.330> can<00:02:37.480> break<00:02:38.370> well<00:02:39.370> these

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:39.460 
carry because they can break well these

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.090 
carry because they can break well these

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
aren't ordinary eggs these are preserved

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:48.570 
aren't ordinary eggs these are preserved
eggs<00:02:42.370> and<00:02:45.690> because<00:02:46.690> they're<00:02:46.840> preserves<00:02:47.580> the

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
eggs and because they're preserves the

eggs and because they're preserves the
lasts<00:02:48.820> a<00:02:49.000> while<00:02:49.440> and<00:02:50.440> you<00:02:50.590> can<00:02:50.710> just<00:02:50.890> take<00:02:51.040> them

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
lasts a while and you can just take them

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.550 
lasts a while and you can just take them
with<00:02:51.370> you<00:02:51.550> and<00:02:52.950> on<00:02:53.950> the<00:02:54.010> inside<00:02:55.440> it's<00:02:56.440> actually

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
with you and on the inside it's actually

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.940 
with you and on the inside it's actually
black<00:02:58.080> and<00:02:59.080> the<00:02:59.140> nice<00:02:59.260> thing<00:02:59.410> about<00:02:59.470> this<00:02:59.740> by

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
black and the nice thing about this by

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.500 
black and the nice thing about this by
the<00:02:59.980> way<00:03:00.190> is<00:03:00.250> if<00:03:00.460> it<00:03:00.580> breaks<00:03:00.790> while<00:03:01.330> you're

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
the way is if it breaks while you're

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.490 
the way is if it breaks while you're
hiking<00:03:03.420> nothing<00:03:04.420> will<00:03:04.600> come<00:03:04.810> out<00:03:04.870> it's<00:03:05.380> not

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
hiking nothing will come out it's not

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.800 
hiking nothing will come out it's not

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
a good flavor it does take a bit of

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.510

it also goes by the name of
thousand-year<00:03:48.540> egg<00:03:48.690> because<00:03:48.870> it<00:03:48.959> looks<00:03:49.140> like

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.700 

is<00:04:47.280> this

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.040 

which<00:04:50.280> is<00:04:50.460> uh<00:04:50.490> you<00:04:50.940> can<00:04:51.389> think<00:04:51.540> of<00:04:51.600> it<00:04:51.690> as<00:04:51.780> like

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
which is uh you can think of it as like

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.950 
which is uh you can think of it as like
Chinese<00:04:52.620> oatmeal<00:04:52.949> I<00:04:53.100> guess<00:04:53.310> or<00:04:53.610> something

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
Chinese oatmeal I guess or something

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.560 
Chinese oatmeal I guess or something
it's<00:04:54.960> black<00:04:55.169> sesame<00:04:55.410> cereal<00:04:56.300> just<00:04:57.300> as<00:04:57.360> black

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
it's black sesame cereal just as black

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:01.070 
it's black sesame cereal just as black
sesame<00:04:57.780> powder<00:04:58.190> put<00:04:59.190> it<00:04:59.280> in<00:04:59.400> hot<00:04:59.580> water<00:04:59.610> and<00:05:00.080> it

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
sesame powder put it in hot water and it

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.670 
sesame powder put it in hot water and it
creates<00:05:01.320> this<00:05:01.470> sort<00:05:01.710> of<00:05:01.830> a<00:05:02.009> creamy<00:05:02.910> sweet<00:05:03.680> sort

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680
