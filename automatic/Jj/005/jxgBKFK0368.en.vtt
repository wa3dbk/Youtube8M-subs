00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
setting it about 125 amps because I'm

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.690 
setting it about 125 amps because I'm
using<00:01:04.970> a<00:01:05.149> 1/8<00:01:05.539> inch<00:01:05.570> welding<00:01:06.500> rod<00:01:06.710> and<00:01:07.340> welding

basic<00:01:20.720> weld<00:01:20.959> works<00:01:21.289> now<00:01:21.500> the<00:01:22.310> ground<00:01:22.550> clamp<00:01:22.819> is

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
basic weld works now the ground clamp is

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.190 
basic weld works now the ground clamp is
just<00:01:23.209> ground<00:01:23.390> to<00:01:23.630> the<00:01:23.720> metal<00:01:23.990> piece<00:01:24.170> that

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
just ground to the metal piece that

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.590 
just ground to the metal piece that
you're<00:01:24.470> welding<00:01:24.649> on<00:01:24.950> the<00:01:25.910> new<00:01:26.060> welding<00:01:26.450> rod

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
you're welding on the new welding rod

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.230 
you're welding on the new welding rod
just<00:01:26.810> goes<00:01:27.020> into<00:01:27.380> the<00:01:27.470> positive<00:01:28.039> wire<00:01:28.250> to<00:01:29.119> do

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
just goes into the positive wire to do

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.359 
just goes into the positive wire to do
the<00:01:29.330> welding<00:01:29.750> with<00:01:29.929> and<00:01:30.740> of<00:01:30.860> course<00:01:31.069> I'm<00:01:31.250> gonna

be<00:01:31.459> wearing<00:01:31.789> a<00:01:31.880> welding<00:01:32.060> helmet<00:01:32.300> so<00:01:32.990> I<00:01:33.020> don't

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
be wearing a welding helmet so I don't

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.249 
be wearing a welding helmet so I don't
get<00:01:33.349> blind<00:01:34.179> and<00:01:35.179> I'm<00:01:35.300> using<00:01:35.509> a<00:01:35.660> special<00:01:36.050> helmet

practice<00:02:27.709> just<00:02:27.980> practice<00:02:28.430> for<00:02:28.580> a<00:02:28.640> while<00:02:28.790> I

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
practice just practice for a while I

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.440 
practice just practice for a while I
found<00:02:31.220> that<00:02:31.430> the<00:02:31.520> best<00:02:31.640> thing<00:02:31.910> to<00:02:31.940> do<00:02:32.150> is<00:02:32.330> to

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
found that the best thing to do is to

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.510 
found that the best thing to do is to
get<00:02:32.570> different<00:02:32.810> pieces<00:02:33.140> of<00:02:33.320> metal<00:02:33.740> practice

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
on them get a book that shows what kind

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.230 
on them get a book that shows what kind
