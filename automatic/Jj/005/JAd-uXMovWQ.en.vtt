in<00:00:00.510> this<00:00:00.780> segment<00:00:00.989> we'll<00:00:01.230> be<00:00:01.290> talking<00:00:01.410> about

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
in this segment we'll be talking about

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.019 
in this segment we'll be talking about
programming<00:00:02.700> the<00:00:02.879> SVC<00:00:04.009> battery-operated

00:00:05.019 --> 00:00:05.029 
programming the SVC battery-operated

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:08.390 
programming the SVC battery-operated
controllers<00:00:06.319> now<00:00:07.319> we'll<00:00:07.589> go<00:00:07.859> and<00:00:08.160> hit<00:00:08.250> the

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
controllers now we'll go and hit the

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.430 
controllers now we'll go and hit the
center<00:00:08.700> button<00:00:08.970> and<00:00:09.240> go<00:00:09.780> to<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:10.019> runtime

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440

remember<00:00:54.780> whatever<00:00:55.020> is<00:00:55.140> flashing<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:55.680> use

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
remember whatever is flashing you use

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.939 
remember whatever is flashing you use
the<00:00:55.980> plus<00:00:56.219> or<00:00:56.460> minus<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:57.030> change<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.480> so<00:00:57.949> every

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
the plus or minus to change it so every

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.099 
the plus or minus to change it so every
station<00:00:59.460> or<00:00:59.579> every<00:00:59.820> every<00:01:00.420> valve<00:01:00.719> needs<00:01:01.020> to

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
station or every every valve needs to

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.950 
station or every every valve needs to
have<00:01:01.230> his<00:01:01.320> own<00:01:01.590> run<00:01:01.829> time<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.539> in<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.629> next

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
have his own run time and in the next

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.719 
have his own run time and in the next
section<00:01:04.320> we'll<00:01:04.439> go<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.680> by<00:01:05.040> using<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.460> center

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
section we'll go to by using the center

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.020 
section we'll go to by using the center
button<00:01:06.000> is<00:01:06.240> going<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.110> be<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.320> water<00:01:07.590> days

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
button is going to be the water days

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.880 
button is going to be the water days
once<00:01:09.030> again<00:01:09.420> this<00:01:09.630> controller<00:01:10.200> is<00:01:10.290> programed

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
once again this controller is programed

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.580 
once again this controller is programed
by<00:01:11.010> station<00:01:11.729> so<00:01:12.210> every<00:01:12.630> station<00:01:12.930> needs<00:01:13.350> its

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
by station so every station needs its

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.310 
by station so every station needs its
own<00:01:13.710> water<00:01:14.040> days<00:01:14.340> what<00:01:15.330> we're<00:01:15.479> seeing<00:01:15.689> here<00:01:16.110> is

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
own water days what we're seeing here is

own water days what we're seeing here is
the<00:01:16.619> calendar<00:01:17.150> and<00:01:18.150> tells<00:01:18.390> us<00:01:18.509> we're<00:01:18.630> in<00:01:18.659> the

water days mode and valve number one is

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.010 
water days mode and valve number one is
shown<00:01:22.170> in<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.409> screen<00:01:22.970> the<00:01:23.970> solid<00:01:24.479> water

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
shown in the screen the solid water

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.160 
shown in the screen the solid water
drops<00:01:25.470> mean<00:01:26.250> it's<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:26.520> water<00:01:26.790> day<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.960> days

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
drops mean it's a water day and the days

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.600 
drops mean it's a water day and the days
that<00:01:28.200> have<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.590> circle<00:01:29.130> with<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.310> line<00:01:29.430> through

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.420 
that have a circle with a line through
it<00:01:29.880> means<00:01:30.119> it's<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.299> non<00:01:30.509> water<00:01:30.869> day<00:01:31.430> previously

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
it means it's a non water day previously

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.410 
it means it's a non water day previously
we<00:01:32.549> selected<00:01:33.119> day<00:01:33.810> one<00:01:34.110> as<00:01:34.409> being<00:01:34.680> Sunday<00:01:35.040> and

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
I'm going to select plus which means yes

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.999 
I'm going to select plus which means yes
to<00:01:41.970> water<00:01:42.180> on<00:01:42.360> Sunday<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.590> cursor
