00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
have a matching then you could use it on

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.290 
have a matching then you could use it on
your<00:02:37.130> belt<00:02:37.280> but<00:02:37.490> otherwise<00:02:37.790> you<00:02:37.940> don't<00:02:38.030> have

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
your belt but otherwise you don't have

your belt but otherwise you don't have
to<00:02:38.480> and<00:02:38.900> actually<00:02:39.500> it's<00:02:39.740> funny<00:02:39.830> because<00:02:40.070> it's

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
to and actually it's funny because it's

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.010 
to and actually it's funny because it's
kind<00:02:40.490> of<00:02:40.520> green<00:02:40.730> and<00:02:40.970> brown<00:02:41.360> you<00:02:41.690> don't<00:02:41.870> really

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
kind of green and brown you don't really

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.360 
kind of green and brown you don't really
think<00:02:42.170> that<00:02:42.500> they<00:02:42.620> go<00:02:42.770> together<00:02:42.950> but<00:02:43.310> they

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
think that they go together but they

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.130 
think that they go together but they
actually<00:02:43.610> go<00:02:43.700> really<00:02:43.940> well<00:02:44.240> together<00:02:44.420> and<00:02:45.050> I

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
actually go really well together and I

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.420 
actually go really well together and I
