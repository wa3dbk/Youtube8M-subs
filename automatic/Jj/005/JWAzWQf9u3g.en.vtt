amoled of course but we now have a

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.209 
amoled of course but we now have a
screen<00:00:34.559> of<00:00:35.360> 5.7<00:00:36.360> millimeters<00:00:37.200> that's<00:00:37.710> really

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
screen of 5.7 millimeters that's really

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:44.860 
screen of 5.7 millimeters that's really
big<00:00:38.399> its<00:00:38.610> qHD<00:00:39.600> meaning<00:00:39.960> you<00:00:40.559> have<00:00:41.780> 1440<00:00:42.780> by

2560<00:00:45.870> pixels<00:00:46.280> so<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.550> have<00:00:48.030> even<00:00:48.329> if<00:00:48.600> it's

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
2560 pixels so you have even if it's

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.619 
2560 pixels so you have even if it's
getting<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.260> little<00:00:49.410> bigger<00:00:50.250> than<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.910> note<00:00:51.239> 3

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629

you will have the same or even more
pixel<00:00:54.840> density<00:00:55.350> as<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:55.620> can<00:00:55.800> see<00:00:56.010> here<00:00:56.100> in<00:00:56.309> the

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
pixel density as you can see here in the

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.720 
pixel density as you can see here in the
app<00:00:56.579> launcher<00:00:57.090> it's<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.960> really<00:00:58.469> sharp<00:00:58.890> picture

and Samsung is declining a claiming that
it<00:01:03.449> will<00:01:03.809> be<00:01:03.989> 20%<00:01:04.739> more<00:01:05.580> colors<00:01:06.299> than<00:01:06.600> on<00:01:07.380> the

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
it will be 20% more colors than on the

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.310

note 3 I can't tell you if this is true
but<00:01:10.500> for<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:10.830> first-time<00:01:11.369> I<00:01:11.880> would<00:01:12.479> say<00:01:12.689> it's<00:01:12.930> a

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
but for a first-time I would say it's a

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.710 
but for a first-time I would say it's a
good<00:01:13.320> image<00:01:13.830> quality<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:15.090> have<00:01:15.119> of<00:01:15.509> course

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
good image quality you have of course

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.570 
good image quality you have of course
tons<00:01:16.290> of<00:01:16.770> new<00:01:17.070> features<00:01:17.369> some<00:01:18.060> with<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.600> new<00:01:18.840> S

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
tons of new features some with the new S

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.969 
tons of new features some with the new S
Pen<00:01:20.580> meaning<00:01:21.330> you<00:01:21.450> have<00:01:21.630> new<00:01:22.020> features<00:01:22.710> on

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
Pen meaning you have new features on

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.969 
Pen meaning you have new features on
this<00:01:23.310> one<00:01:23.600> because<00:01:24.600> this<00:01:25.020> has<00:01:25.590> been<00:01:25.799> the

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
this one because this has been the

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.390 
this one because this has been the
sensors<00:01:26.460> more<00:01:27.180> sensitive<00:01:28.280> concerning<00:01:29.280> the

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
sensors more sensitive concerning the

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.539 
sensors more sensitive concerning the
angle<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.390> pressure<00:01:31.110> intensity<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.250> so

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
angle and the pressure intensity and so

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.450 
angle and the pressure intensity and so
on<00:01:32.729> all<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:34.140> have<00:01:34.290> one<00:01:34.530> example<00:01:34.920> here<00:01:35.220> the

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
on all to have one example here the

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.109 
on all to have one example here the
front<00:01:35.670> camera<00:01:35.970> has<00:01:36.619> 3.7<00:01:37.619> billion<00:01:37.799> me<00:01:38.070> as<00:01:38.250> 3.7

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
front camera has 3.7 billion me as 3.7

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.800 
front camera has 3.7 billion me as 3.7
megapixels<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.140> there<00:01:41.070> shall<00:01:41.250> be<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.670> pen<00:01:42.509> or<00:01:42.630> a

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
megapixels and there shall be a pen or a

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.230 
megapixels and there shall be a pen or a
pen<00:01:43.229> mode<00:01:43.560> yeah<00:01:43.979> so<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:44.670> you<00:01:44.790> can<00:01:44.970> shoot

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
pen mode yeah so that you can shoot

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.800 
pen mode yeah so that you can shoot
selfies<00:01:46.079> while<00:01:46.640> turning<00:01:47.640> this<00:01:47.759> around<00:01:48.000> having

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
selfies while turning this around having

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.130 
selfies while turning this around having
captured<00:01:49.790> 120<00:01:50.790> degrees<00:01:51.210> all<00:01:51.540> together

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
captured 120 degrees all together

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.590 
captured 120 degrees all together
so<00:01:52.680> making<00:01:52.920> group<00:01:53.369> selfies<00:01:53.909> for<00:01:54.119> example

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
so making group selfies for example

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.700 
so making group selfies for example
shall<00:01:55.170> be<00:01:55.470> more<00:01:55.860> easy<00:01:56.310> with<00:01:56.670> this<00:01:56.909> but<00:01:57.899> what<00:01:58.469> i

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
shall be more easy with this but what i

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.389 
shall be more easy with this but what i
found<00:01:59.700> most<00:01:59.880> impressing<00:02:00.810> of<00:02:00.930> all<00:02:01.110> is<00:02:01.649> that<00:02:02.189> you

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
found most impressing of all is that you

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.840 
found most impressing of all is that you
now<00:02:02.670> have<00:02:02.930> easier<00:02:03.930> way<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.229> get<00:02:04.740> dual<00:02:05.189> window

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
now have easier way to get dual window

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.330 
now have easier way to get dual window
mode<00:02:06.119> let's<00:02:06.420> say<00:02:06.570> for<00:02:07.049> example<00:02:07.110> here<00:02:07.799> in<00:02:08.129> the

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
mode let's say for example here in the

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.309 
mode let's say for example here in the
camera<00:02:08.700> you<00:02:09.030> can<00:02:09.060> see<00:02:09.270> just<00:02:09.690> drag<00:02:10.050> and<00:02:10.289> drop

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
camera you can see just drag and drop

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.230 
camera you can see just drag and drop
from<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:11.009> side<00:02:11.310> you

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
from the side you

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.390 
from the side you
now<00:02:12.300> can<00:02:12.630> move<00:02:12.870> your<00:02:13.260> windows<00:02:13.740> wherever<00:02:14.250> you

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
now can move your windows wherever you

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.660 
now can move your windows wherever you
wanted<00:02:14.850> or<00:02:15.630> for<00:02:16.170> example<00:02:16.680> getting<00:02:16.980> it<00:02:17.250> smaller

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
wanted or for example getting it smaller

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.260 
wanted or for example getting it smaller
like<00:02:18.330> this<00:02:18.960> one<00:02:19.470> here<00:02:19.890> so<00:02:20.280> this<00:02:20.640> is<00:02:20.880> more

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
like this one here so this is more

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.720 
like this one here so this is more
easier<00:02:21.660> to<00:02:21.720> manage<00:02:22.650> this<00:02:22.890> so<00:02:23.130> you<00:02:23.190> don't<00:02:23.460> have

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
easier to manage this so you don't have

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.250 
easier to manage this so you don't have
to<00:02:24.480> go<00:02:24.660> into<00:02:24.990> this<00:02:25.470> dual<00:02:26.300> mode<00:02:27.300> you<00:02:27.630> might<00:02:27.900> know

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
to go into this dual mode you might know

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.350 
to go into this dual mode you might know
from<00:02:28.650> this<00:02:28.860> but<00:02:29.640> there<00:02:29.880> are<00:02:30.060> new

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
from this but there are new

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.810 
from this but there are new
functionalities<00:02:31.140> over<00:02:31.620> there<00:02:31.890> -<00:02:32.220> of<00:02:32.460> course

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
functionalities over there - of course

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.520 
functionalities over there - of course
let's<00:02:33.150> say<00:02:33.300> for<00:02:33.480> example<00:02:33.540> if<00:02:34.020> you<00:02:34.050> have<00:02:34.320> a

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
let's say for example if you have a

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.150 
let's say for example if you have a
gallery<00:02:34.980> open<00:02:35.550> there<00:02:35.760> and<00:02:36.410> the<00:02:37.410> emails<00:02:37.800> down

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
gallery open there and the emails down

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.790 
gallery open there and the emails down
there<00:02:38.490> you<00:02:38.820> now<00:02:39.090> for<00:02:39.780> example<00:02:40.410> can<00:02:42.560> now<00:02:43.560> for

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
there you now for example can now for

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.190 
there you now for example can now for
example<00:02:43.890> can<00:02:44.520> manage<00:02:44.940> it<00:02:45.150> like<00:02:45.330> this<00:02:45.540> with

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
example can manage it like this with

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.860 
example can manage it like this with
this<00:02:46.440> quick<00:02:47.070> sharing<00:02:47.580> icon<00:02:48.210> or<00:02:48.360> whatever<00:02:48.660> that

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
this quick sharing icon or whatever that

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.410

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
this is from our first test over here

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.220 
this is from our first test over here
with<00:03:01.830> two<00:03:02.190> images<00:03:02.610> you<00:03:02.970> now<00:03:03.270> can<00:03:03.660> send<00:03:04.020> to

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
with two images you now can send to

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.180 
with two images you now can send to
whoever<00:03:04.890> you<00:03:05.250> want<00:03:05.580> to<00:03:05.670> so<00:03:06.300> you<00:03:06.690> now<00:03:06.870> know<00:03:07.190> what

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
whoever you want to so you now know what

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.750 
whoever you want to so you now know what
you<00:03:08.340> can<00:03:08.550> do<00:03:08.730> with<00:03:09.090> these<00:03:09.360> multi<00:03:09.930> window<00:03:10.860> modes

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
you can do with these multi window modes

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.630 
you can do with these multi window modes
yeah<00:03:12.390> the<00:03:12.600> battery<00:03:12.960> is<00:03:13.290> two<00:03:13.980> three<00:03:14.220> thousand

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
yeah the battery is two three thousand

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.580 
yeah the battery is two three thousand
two<00:03:14.850> hundred<00:03:14.880> and<00:03:15.300> twenty<00:03:15.780> milliamp<00:03:16.080> per<00:03:16.410> hour

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
two hundred and twenty milliamp per hour

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.550 
two hundred and twenty milliamp per hour
so<00:03:16.950> seems<00:03:17.610> to<00:03:17.790> be<00:03:17.910> just<00:03:18.780> a<00:03:18.930> little<00:03:18.960> bit<00:03:19.350> more

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
so seems to be just a little bit more

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.140 
so seems to be just a little bit more
than<00:03:19.830> the<00:03:20.070> node<00:03:20.370> three<00:03:20.760> nevertheless

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
than the node three nevertheless

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.010 
than the node three nevertheless
sometimes<00:03:22.050> claiming<00:03:22.800> that<00:03:22.950> you<00:03:23.130> shall<00:03:23.400> have

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.020 
sometimes claiming that you shall have

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:31.280 
sometimes claiming that you shall have
7.5<00:03:25.020> percent<00:03:25.820> longer<00:03:27.200> time<00:03:28.200> to<00:03:28.230> use<00:03:29.130> it<00:03:29.430> so<00:03:30.290> we

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
7.5 percent longer time to use it so we

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.410 
7.5 percent longer time to use it so we
have<00:03:31.440> to<00:03:31.590> see<00:03:31.800> how<00:03:32.190> this<00:03:32.490> will<00:03:32.790> be<00:03:32.970> blocking

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
have to see how this will be blocking

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.540 
have to see how this will be blocking
because<00:03:33.540> you<00:03:33.870> have<00:03:34.020> way<00:03:34.410> more<00:03:34.440> pixels<00:03:35.190> over

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
because you have way more pixels over

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.780 
because you have way more pixels over
here<00:03:35.670> on<00:03:35.820> this<00:03:36.000> what<00:03:36.660> HD<00:03:37.200> display<00:03:37.680> but<00:03:38.250> we<00:03:38.580> will

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
here on this what HD display but we will

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:39.230 
here on this what HD display but we will
see

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:39.240 
see

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.020 
yeah that's I hope enough for a first
