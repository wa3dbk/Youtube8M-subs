00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.150
 minced meat 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:27.550
 sozhki so called 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:30.189
 so for this you need potatoes 4 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:34.270
 medium sized potatoes three per 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:40.420
 grater cheese grams 200 then already 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:43.300
 coarse grater three 2 onions finely cut 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:47.110
 and fry in vegetable oil slightly 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:52.479
 I'm here a little so it is fried 5 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:55.809
 eggs, too, finely cut or have a minute 

00:00:52.479 --> 00:01:01.960
 adapting very quickly no need to cut 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:02.920
 hit anything and so here through this 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.290
 lattice 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.260

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:12.189

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:15.250
 so fast chick chick and everything is ready and stuffing 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:17.590
 the minced meat is cooked like meatballs or there on 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.830
 dumplings mixed onions garlic so 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:24.300
 pepper that you usually add here 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:32.010
 I'm here just I added onions pepper 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:36.040
 salt we do it like that 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:46.740
 lozenges diameter somewhere centimeters 10 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:46.740
 here and so further we form one more 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:02:01.580
 refuel 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:02:01.580
 spoon onion 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.710
 no umishko galata 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:33.110
 then eggs eggs need a little season 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:36.830
 mayonnaise can be peppered 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:54.130
 but I added minced pepper and therefore not 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:03:00.040
 I will make alcohol so also here 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:00.040
 we spread on each cell 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:30.890
 so on take potatoes and 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:34.879
 in the form of stash here here we put on each 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.879
 on each cake 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:54.430
 So 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:54.430
 and then sprinkle with cheese 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:17.470
 Here it turns out in the form of Sasha is 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:21.540
 artwork and mayonnaise can 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.540
 netting 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.200
 then melt in the oven 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:51.819
 You can correct with a spoon so that 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:54.789
 fill the entire body from the leaf only 

00:04:51.819 --> 00:04:56.649
 I took a kilo of minced meat I fill 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:05:05.319
 Now leaf and then put in the oven 

00:04:56.649 --> 00:05:08.860

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:20.409
 right side of the window and the sun just like that 

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:24.159

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:40.180
