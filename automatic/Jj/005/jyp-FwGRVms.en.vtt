00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.670
 I went and have all 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.529

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.210
 somehow somehow they thought so 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.560

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:35.250
 what if I just 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:38.250
 it does so because many youtubers 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.860

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.780
 no battle or battle 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.980
 during a battle but not that 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.960
 after a battle , that's what it is 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.039
 i would like to show i just cant 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.420
 I have not seen it again 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.820

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.739
 my channel and yes the whole thing too 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.190
 Here is another water coming back 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.840
 and I start again from the right side 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:06.570
 here a very chic of the republic here 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:10.350
 with 2 x 500 first clone the pilots 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.780
 so to speak yes then here one of the bon scott 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.530
 fifth thing has the broken truiden gone 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.330
 create here 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:21.750
 he carries his head behind me I found 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:23.939
 quite funny because here was the how will 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.689
 The critic is invited to 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.049
 investigate 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:36.299
 then here is a first 500 first goal 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:39.030
 out of several I'm just looking like 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.759
 I show that he is against Dietrich 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.909
 speak custom away from you all 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:47.460
 funny 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:52.140
 the requested chat trooper one of 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:56.369
 which or as sharper 100 is therefore 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.200
 the first 500 still 1 212 the fed cup 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.090
 with this weird vehicle here too 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.700
 to cancel you completely 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.549
 then here i have the druids 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.099
 does it to what were killed there 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:11.599
 have the light bulb hung up because I 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:16.319
 the idea should then fall here the 2 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:19.440
 anderson giggs rubber construction with their 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:24.239
 jets the weapons came from very cool 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:27.019
 then bring the clones is as I can here 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:29.340
 again on because they are expecting rex 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:32.450
 are here commander cody with his 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.170
 first officer with a twelve super 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.900
 pick up record 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:41.069
 then here would be the vehicle of it 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:43.739
 What broke what we are 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:47.250
 work has to be locked up 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:49.140
 I made time and is here 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.390
 pays off and her father is here 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.280
 words fuck how are you and i have 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.920
 applied my trick because I have 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.750
 Just go here so laid out 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.579
 who has no head that is exactly 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.250
 I's just the more I was brought 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:34.889
 think that's pretty clear 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:36.510
 and that from below in here yet 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:38.549
 always the clown of what the environment 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:42.329
 Check out a bit green here 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:45.720
 like, yes, but that actually fits 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:48.040
 somewhere else I find better team here 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:53.569
 the whole robbed and here the 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:57.370
 first the hotel not having stop 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:59.480
 the chatroom operates on this table 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:05.840
 lay back now and is always 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:08.000
 that's why it's a bit that's it 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.700
 actually the only thing inside 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.920
 has changed because all roads 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.739
 now employ a left-wing scene like 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:20.630
 did you see these two have 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:23.090
 Ochtruper here crm why they have 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.250
 the protected hollow and take now 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.690
 They say the leaves and go 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.550
 but the archer on it I think that is 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.680
 one of the typical scenes that I ever had 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:34.220
 In lego Star Wars has seen that she 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:37.250
 clone that with leaves cover and yes 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:40.370
 i think it is this this july 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:44.030
 just bought pretty cool that 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:45.260
 I like the picture I like 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.270
 that idea it's cool i've never had it 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.580
 someone we've done something like that 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:53.020
 it also makes me feel really good 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:56.000
 and yes, say what she thinks about it, so to speak 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.410
 one in the beginning of the war already in 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.510
 drink a crib during the battle so 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.660
 butchering with a bit of battle 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:04.250
 and now the cleanup work so 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:07.099
 We find a few scenes is real 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:08.210
 funny and also hare very realistic 

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:10.639
 held so to speak 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:12.590
 and yes I am thank you I am happy 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:14.780
 ever again the warm up with 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:17.590
 a rebuild as it is now called and 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.590
 bye bye
