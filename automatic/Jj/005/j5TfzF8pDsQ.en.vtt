00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.840
 hello together and welcome to one 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.640
 another coup 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.650
 Today the vegetarians are happy 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.070
 I'm a little bit more than it is possible 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:32.279
 yes, what vegetarian and I do 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.010
 pumpkin mozzarella and pumpkin today 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.680
 we need the following ingredients grated 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.860
 Pumpkin of course, the liquid beautiful 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.890
 express and best small 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.370
 hokkaido pumpkin bermes animal that not 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.489
 steal 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:53.320
 You can eat the bowl then small 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:58.100
 diced mozzarella some flour eggs 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:59.690
 some small chopped salt as well 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.449
 pepper and of course a little one 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.989
 a little bit of oil for the transport 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:04.729
 to have 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.770
 that was definitely the case 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.619
 ingredients this is not much as you see 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.420
 and we can start right away 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:12.640
 First we go to the grated and 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:20.030
 body in a bowl 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:30.470
 In addition, the eggs are also the 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:32.649
 mozzarella diced and chopped 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.649
 Flour 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:41.210
 and if that is some people because of that 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.760
 whole is then kneaded into a dough 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:55.190
 already wash your hands before as always 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:02:03.380
 when cooking but now extremely with salt 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:05.030
 and pepper is spiced up all the time 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.650
 Of course, that's right on the 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.810
 You do not have to do that at the beginning 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:13.450
 first washed his hands and again 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.450
 but I have currently stirring 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
 knead together 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:23.060
 and with that the dough is already finished 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.070
 if that should be a bit wet here 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.810
 then you can take it off and form it 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.280
 but only before me if that's the case 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.950
 then it's just a little bit more 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.410
 Do more but in any case it is 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.020
 finished now and we can go directly to 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:42.580
 then you notice oil in one 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:46.040
 pan and portionwise into the day 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:48.340
 with a spoon nice center too 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.340
 buffer 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:56.360
 and then they are brought, of course 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.750
 even though we were both of us 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.280
 fried well 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:05.570
 and that just makes it to the 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:08.450
 dough is used up so that's the 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:10.430
 Finished squash mozzarella buffers like 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.740
 I can see you there a bit 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:16.870
 herbal quark packed or herbs 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:18.740
 Fat as you can find it now 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.050
 the djp is actually quite simple 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:24.170
 For example, just take one 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:26.890
 bit quark and mix yogurt 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.890
 that with each other 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.900
 I can not even say anything more 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.650
 Actually take ingredients mostly 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.330
 bear in equal parts 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:41.390
 some also take some on Mondays too 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.510
 only yoghurt klaus remains for everyone 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.510
 leave 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.290
 and thereto is simply a couple 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:51.400
 fresh herbs in my case 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.400
 Chives and dill 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.120
 then salt 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.420
 stephan often comes here to rest 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.690
 and then just taste it and ever 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.820
 but still something of something 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.870
 Need to do it again so if we 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.720
 then a little yogurt or 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.870
 quark or spices and then it is 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:32.870
 actually already finished the herbal job 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:36.320
 yes and every two days you can do it 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:38.510
 eat salad so it goes with it or 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.680
 stop is salt mac in between 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.080
 can be yes 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.510
 the recipe of it you can find on each 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.669
 case on biallo.de as well as the 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.590
 correct information about the ingredients and 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:51.110
 a rating from Peter and me 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:53.630
 and should you wish to imitate this 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.900
 I wish you a lot of fun and a good one 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:55.900
 appetite
