00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.670
 we feel everyone was at the halls 

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:05.190
 and we end up in a tutorial on the perrons with the pistons 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.110
 what we think the latter 

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.110
 so we'll see how it works oxygen say it 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:13.689
 at the end of itself 

00:00:13.689 --> 00:00:17.050
 and the light comes on in the hallway 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.070
 this breaks it is also if it's not all at the same time because what we 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:21.980
 did not know 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.819
 Tehran is not at the same time 

00:00:24.819 --> 00:00:27.819
 in the wake of apple come 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:30.179
 I the moon 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.190
 p a vault 

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:35.950
 esf and eye entry to these classes for this time 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.850
 so we'll see how it goes 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.030
 Alger 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.670
 so how to oil 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:45.850
 the pistons 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.210
 so the two ways to find the first 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.810
 so we find social that bigger already used 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.510
 so we can find fags 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.680
 he is known as the seco 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.460
 and for those who cry concert when we are under eyelids 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.460
 why we have all the trappings of teeth 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.750
 hennessy we can also 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:06.930
 press it up 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.170
 the current above 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.640
 and we turn on 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.570
 and for sandy slopes 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.570
 we will go here we have a little fast he said here it's instantaneous 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.960
 besides a block 3 over here 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.280
 and therefore also sent a block that can impute track is the reason 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.640
 and on a little more weight to the grounds in our half that of being silent 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.990
 and so it's good 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.440
 so here I can not be the motive is in question 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.440
 our evidence is being learned three blocks 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.960
 in cold here a fact 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.330
 lightweight guitars with help the break clause 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.190
 alas the p 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.130
 and I am here for the sake of their lot 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.340
 to go up gradually and 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.270
 the lever is a state 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.640
 the public is doing good 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.570
 why because convoy winter pistons 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.950
 good salivait so is there for the tackler the opportunity agosto 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.500
 so it'll be done 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:10.659
 I repeated to the motives several times 

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:15.839
 so in fact it is older age the assembly are only 36 possible 

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:18.839
 that's what makes you dirty with time 

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:20.879
 p here in the vault 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:23.879
 what happens is little old for 100 th 

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:27.239
 the lro 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:28.969
 what happens is little 

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:31.749
 it's first for this suite that light up 

00:02:31.749 --> 00:02:34.809
 after that one like that one this one saddle 

00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:38.659
 bankole sow lille 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:41.659
 it's just showing that we can exactly the same as we can 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:45.429
 so also here I took when he exhorts 

00:02:45.429 --> 00:02:48.429
 e note that the rollier bias 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:51.329
 so in fact 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:52.989
 the press at the insep 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.199
 and also the very important with what practice comes out 

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:57.779
 what is happening 

00:02:57.779 --> 00:03:00.899
 just because that's the officer 

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:02.669
 so in fact part of the orders 

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:05.389
 Township of Bordeaux when we change coach 

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:08.149
 the lockout came out Saturday 

00:03:08.149 --> 00:03:09.859
 Luckily 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:13.480
 so we pass six eco classes charles which is for him at this level 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:18.620
 why near central java like that when we've been leveraged high by 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:19.089
 the top 

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:20.989
 you want the parliament 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:23.539
 the current was one too 

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:24.849
 after what i want 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:26.459
 so also very important 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.419
 it does not suit me when you do not play because paul 

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:32.999
 because if you have 8% after adjustments to tufflers put them in 

00:03:32.999 --> 00:03:33.789
 your own 

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:37.109
 you turn on the light and at the sound and profiteers of his ticket on that 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:38.019
 being 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:40.569
 why it's frankly not cool 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:44.329
 so here it is very important not to do without franck leblanc has 

00:03:44.999 --> 00:03:48.119
 so that girls time or so is no longer present on twitter 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:51.569
 e finally your career 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:52.829
 So here is 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:53.689
 titillated soon
