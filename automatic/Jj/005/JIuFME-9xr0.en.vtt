brake<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.270> that's<00:01:42.390> what's<00:01:42.570> holding<00:01:42.720> me<00:01:42.930> on

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
brake and that's what's holding me on

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.440 
brake and that's what's holding me on
this<00:01:43.799> hill<00:01:44.009> now<00:01:44.189> if<00:01:44.460> I<00:01:44.790> let<00:01:44.939> go<00:01:45.000> of<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.329> front

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
this hill now if I let go of the front

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.880 
this hill now if I let go of the front
of<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.899> rear<00:01:46.049> brake<00:01:46.229> sorry<00:01:46.470> I'm<00:01:46.649> going<00:01:46.799> to

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
of the rear brake sorry I'm going to

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.130 
of the rear brake sorry I'm going to
roll<00:01:47.070> see<00:01:48.950> so<00:01:49.950> basically<00:01:50.939> you<00:01:51.329> use<00:01:51.540> your<00:01:51.780> rear

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
roll see so basically you use your rear

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.620 
roll see so basically you use your rear
brake<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.560> hold<00:01:52.740> you<00:01:52.890> there<00:01:53.040> and<00:01:53.360> then<00:01:54.360> all<00:01:54.540> you

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
brake to hold you there and then all you

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.020 
brake to hold you there and then all you
need<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:54.840> do<00:01:54.990> is<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.320> give<00:01:55.439> it<00:01:55.470> some<00:01:55.710> throttle

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
need to do is to give it some throttle

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.789 
need to do is to give it some throttle
it's<00:01:57.030> just<00:01:57.270> like<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.450> normal<00:01:57.719> take<00:01:58.110> off<00:01:58.259> now<00:01:58.500> so

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
it's just like a normal take off now so

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.319 
it's just like a normal take off now so
just<00:01:58.920> pretend<00:01:59.130> you're<00:01:59.399> on<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.490> flat<00:01:59.820> road<00:02:00.030> now

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
just pretend you're on a flat road now

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.230 
just pretend you're on a flat road now
and<00:02:00.659> you<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:01.590> yet<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:01.950> you're<00:02:02.790> going<00:02:02.969> to<00:02:03.060> take

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
and you and yet and you're going to take

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.450 
and you and yet and you're going to take
off<00:02:03.450> but<00:02:03.719> when<00:02:03.869> you<00:02:04.020> when<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.829> clutch<00:02:05.070> engages

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
off but when you when the clutch engages

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.789 
off but when you when the clutch engages
and<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:05.939> black<00:02:06.149> wants<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.509> go<00:02:06.630> forward<00:02:06.930> that's

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
and the black wants to go forward that's

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.680 
and the black wants to go forward that's
when<00:02:07.979> you<00:02:08.039> take<00:02:08.220> your<00:02:08.369> foot<00:02:08.520> off<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.640> brake<00:02:08.759> so

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
when you take your foot off the brake so

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.210 
when you take your foot off the brake so
it's<00:02:09.810> just<00:02:09.929> like<00:02:10.140> a<00:02:10.170> flat<00:02:10.500> start<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:11.069> only

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
it's just like a flat start the only

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.150 
it's just like a flat start the only
thing<00:02:11.430> is<00:02:11.610> you<00:02:11.970> have

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
thing is you have

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.100 
thing is you have
your<00:02:12.310> foot<00:02:12.490> on<00:02:12.580> the<00:02:12.670> break<00:02:12.880> when<00:02:13.660> you<00:02:13.780> start<00:02:13.990> to

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
your foot on the break when you start to

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.110 
your foot on the break when you start to
take<00:02:14.260> off<00:02:14.410> and<00:02:14.620> then<00:02:14.710> when<00:02:14.830> it<00:02:14.920> starts<00:02:15.250> to<00:02:15.400> you

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
take off and then when it starts to you

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.310 
take off and then when it starts to you
know<00:02:16.180> move<00:02:16.480> that's<00:02:16.780> when<00:02:16.930> you<00:02:16.990> take<00:02:17.110> your<00:02:17.200> foot

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
know move that's when you take your foot

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.230 
know move that's when you take your foot
off<00:02:17.380> the<00:02:17.470> brake<00:02:17.560> so<00:02:17.890> basically<00:02:18.250> I'll<00:02:18.580> do<00:02:19.120> it

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
off the brake so basically I'll do it

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.440 
off the brake so basically I'll do it
slow<00:02:19.480> here<00:02:20.460> you<00:02:21.460> you<00:02:22.060> give<00:02:22.210> it<00:02:22.270> some<00:02:22.360> throttle

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
slow here you you give it some throttle

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.230 
slow here you you give it some throttle
right<00:02:23.010> probably<00:02:24.010> not<00:02:24.190> that<00:02:24.340> much<00:02:24.520> but<00:02:24.760> as<00:02:24.940> well

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
right probably not that much but as well

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.550 
right probably not that much but as well
even<00:02:25.450> more<00:02:25.720> if<00:02:25.870> you<00:02:25.960> want<00:02:26.110> to<00:02:26.200> I<00:02:26.230> can<00:02:26.410> probably

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
even more if you want to I can probably

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.890 
even more if you want to I can probably
get<00:02:26.740> it<00:02:26.770> right<00:02:27.220> up<00:02:27.340> there<00:02:27.570> just<00:02:28.570> give<00:02:28.750> it<00:02:28.810> as

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
get it right up there just give it as

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.350 
get it right up there just give it as
much<00:02:28.930> trouble<00:02:29.320> as<00:02:29.530> you'd<00:02:29.710> like<00:02:29.920> and<00:02:30.210> let<00:02:31.210> the

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
much trouble as you'd like and let the

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.330 
much trouble as you'd like and let the
clutch<00:02:31.540> out<00:02:31.750> and<00:02:32.020> when<00:02:32.800> I<00:02:32.830> starts<00:02:33.100> to<00:02:33.190> grab

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
clutch out and when I starts to grab

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.600 
clutch out and when I starts to grab
hear<00:02:33.730> it<00:02:33.820> hear<00:02:34.210> it<00:02:34.240> grab<00:02:34.510> them

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
hear it hear it grab them

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.860 
hear it hear it grab them
here<00:02:37.610> that<00:02:37.730> and<00:02:37.970> I<00:02:38.030> can<00:02:38.180> even<00:02:38.270> feel<00:02:38.510> the<00:02:38.570> bike

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
here that and I can even feel the bike

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.540 
here that and I can even feel the bike
jolt<00:02:39.410> forward<00:02:39.800> slightly<00:02:40.130> because<00:02:40.220> it<00:02:40.370> wants

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
jolt forward slightly because it wants

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.340 
jolt forward slightly because it wants
to<00:02:40.670> go<00:02:40.850> there<00:02:41.330> anything<00:02:41.480> is<00:02:41.750> I'm<00:02:42.050> preventing

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
to go there anything is I'm preventing

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:43.660 
to go there anything is I'm preventing
it<00:02:42.560> from<00:02:42.590> moving<00:02:42.710> because<00:02:43.070> my<00:02:43.280> foots<00:02:43.520> on<00:02:43.640> the

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
it from moving because my foots on the

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.910 
it from moving because my foots on the
brake<00:02:43.760> so<00:02:44.690> you<00:02:44.720> probably<00:02:45.230> figured<00:02:45.410> it<00:02:45.680> out<00:02:45.770> by

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
brake so you probably figured it out by

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:46.300 
brake so you probably figured it out by
now

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
now

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.980 
now
once<00:02:46.700> the<00:02:46.880> clutch<00:02:47.060> engages<00:02:47.390> and<00:02:47.660> it<00:02:47.720> wants<00:02:47.900> to

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
once the clutch engages and it wants to

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.140 
once the clutch engages and it wants to
go<00:02:48.080> forward<00:02:48.350> just<00:02:49.160> take<00:02:49.760> your<00:02:49.910> foot<00:02:50.000> off<00:02:50.060> the

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
go forward just take your foot off the

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.090 
go forward just take your foot off the
brake<00:02:50.240> and<00:02:50.630> you'll<00:02:51.320> move<00:02:51.470> forward<00:02:51.860> and<00:02:51.980> then

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
brake and you'll move forward and then

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.320 
brake and you'll move forward and then
from<00:02:52.280> that<00:02:52.430> point<00:02:52.610> onwards<00:02:52.910> give<00:02:53.090> it<00:02:53.180> a<00:02:53.209> bit

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
from that point onwards give it a bit

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.000 
from that point onwards give it a bit
more<00:02:53.480> throttle<00:02:53.870> and<00:02:54.020> let<00:02:54.290> the<00:02:54.560> clutch<00:02:54.740> out<00:02:54.890> the

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
more throttle and let the clutch out the

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.540 
more throttle and let the clutch out the
whole<00:02:55.160> way<00:02:55.310> and<00:02:55.340> you'll<00:02:55.640> start<00:02:55.880> moving<00:02:56.270> so

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
whole way and you'll start moving so

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.880 
whole way and you'll start moving so
throttle<00:02:58.550> clutch<00:02:59.090> out<00:02:59.360> put<00:03:00.200> off<00:03:00.320> the<00:03:00.380> brake<00:03:00.620> a

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
throttle clutch out put off the brake a

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.650 
throttle clutch out put off the brake a
bit<00:03:01.280> more<00:03:01.610> throttle<00:03:01.940> a<00:03:02.000> bit<00:03:02.150> more<00:03:02.270> clutch<00:03:02.510> it

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
bit more throttle a bit more clutch it

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.640 
bit more throttle a bit more clutch it
out<00:03:02.780> and<00:03:03.070> there<00:03:04.070> you<00:03:04.130> go<00:03:05.350> that's<00:03:06.350> all<00:03:06.440> you<00:03:06.530> have

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
out and there you go that's all you have

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.100 
out and there you go that's all you have
to<00:03:06.740> do<00:03:06.890> like<00:03:07.459> that<00:03:07.700> Thor<00:03:08.300> is<00:03:08.330> too<00:03:08.660> he'll<00:03:08.840> start

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
to do like that Thor is too he'll start

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.570 
to do like that Thor is too he'll start
it's<00:03:09.230> so<00:03:09.380> easy<00:03:10.060> so<00:03:11.060> let's<00:03:11.270> try<00:03:11.390> it<00:03:11.420> again<00:03:11.540> and

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
it's so easy so let's try it again and

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.710 
it's so easy so let's try it again and
I'm<00:03:13.580> going<00:03:13.730> to<00:03:13.760> stop<00:03:13.940> at<00:03:14.030> this<00:03:14.150> red<00:03:14.360> light<00:03:14.390> so

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
I'm going to stop at this red light so
