 house width and even come in the rain 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.120
 she protected from the carport directly to the 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.120

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.030
 access to the porsche of course 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.490

 enjoy and of course that is 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.160
 favorite place of the owners sit here 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.920
 they are wonderfully protected 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.470
 Wind in the rain or too much sun 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.380
 The railing not only looks nice 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.270
 There is also an optical protection 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.820
 from the outside make the American style 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.250
 a few details on the one hand 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.010
 the typical transverse entrapment we have 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.440
 she kept in antibes white in the 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.479
 Upper floor of deep green shutters 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.210
 that optically reduces the big one 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.280
 roof surface the deep green of the shops 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.220
 is wonderfully aware of the white of the 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.170
 facade off the windows have sprouted 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.180
 subdivisions and they go outward 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.729
 sometimes it's just that 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.020
 the small things make everything a big one 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.060
 to be whole 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.020
 The carport is with a small one 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.090
 turrets 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.860
 here is a light that integrates the 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.060
 evening a wonderful romantic 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.060
 atmosphere radiates 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.890
 We say goodbye to Lake Constance now 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:28.110
 Leave this American wood out 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.790
 if they liked it we will see each other 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.840

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.840
