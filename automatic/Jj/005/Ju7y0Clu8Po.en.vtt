00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
let's take a look at it okay so as I

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
nearly twice as fast is what the THL

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.890 
nearly twice as fast is what the THL
w200<00:03:01.200> was<00:03:01.709> so<00:03:02.580> let's<00:03:03.180> go<00:03:03.390> into<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:03.600> settings

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
w200 was so let's go into the settings

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.190 
w200 was so let's go into the settings
and<00:03:04.290> see<00:03:04.500> what<00:03:04.650> this<00:03:04.830> is<00:03:04.980> running<00:03:05.989> this<00:03:06.989> is

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
and see what this is running this is

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.650 
and see what this is running this is
nearly<00:03:07.470> stock<00:03:07.890> however<00:03:08.820> it<00:03:08.970> does<00:03:09.090> have<00:03:09.300> a<00:03:09.330> few

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
nearly stock however it does have a few

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.430 
nearly stock however it does have a few
custom<00:03:10.080> icons<00:03:10.500> and<00:03:11.000> just<00:03:12.000> just<00:03:12.540> a<00:03:12.720> few<00:03:13.140> UI

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
custom icons and just just a few UI

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.100 
custom icons and just just a few UI
tweaks<00:03:13.590> not<00:03:14.190> too<00:03:14.730> bad<00:03:14.970> but<00:03:15.360> there<00:03:15.600> are<00:03:15.750> some

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
tweaks not too bad but there are some

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.800 
tweaks not too bad but there are some
minor<00:03:16.350> UI<00:03:16.620> tweaks<00:03:17.180> so<00:03:18.180> we<00:03:18.330> can<00:03:18.480> see<00:03:18.660> we<00:03:18.780> have

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
minor UI tweaks so we can see we have

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.130 
minor UI tweaks so we can see we have
android<00:03:19.500> 4.2<00:03:20.070> point2<00:03:20.519> jellybean<00:03:21.030> you<00:03:22.019> can

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
android 4.2 point2 jellybean you can

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.500 
android 4.2 point2 jellybean you can
also<00:03:22.260> see<00:03:22.620> that<00:03:22.650> the<00:03:22.890> phone<00:03:23.100> has<00:03:23.130> one<00:03:24.060> gigabyte

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
also see that the phone has one gigabyte

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.660 
also see that the phone has one gigabyte
of<00:03:24.780> on-board<00:03:25.019> ram<00:03:25.500> this<00:03:25.860> is<00:03:26.010> not<00:03:26.160> a<00:03:26.220> bump<00:03:26.519> up

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
of on-board ram this is not a bump up

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.449 
of on-board ram this is not a bump up
from<00:03:26.850> the<00:03:26.940> THL<00:03:27.390> w200<00:03:27.870> but<00:03:28.709> it<00:03:28.830> should<00:03:29.010> be<00:03:29.040> noted

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
from the THL w200 but it should be noted

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.190 
from the THL w200 but it should be noted
that one<00:03:29.760> gigabyte<00:03:30.120> of<00:03:30.239> ram<00:03:30.420> is<00:03:30.600> plenty<00:03:31.080> for

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
that one gigabyte of ram is plenty for

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.750 
that one gigabyte of ram is plenty for
