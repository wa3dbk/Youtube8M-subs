00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
in this short instructional video I'm

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.030 
in this short instructional video I'm
going<00:00:06.330> to<00:00:06.510> show<00:00:06.720> you<00:00:06.779> how<00:00:07.319> to<00:00:07.380> set<00:00:07.710> the<00:00:07.830> map

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
going to show you how to set the map

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.580 
going to show you how to set the map
using<00:00:08.670> the<00:00:08.760> land<00:00:08.969> and<00:00:09.299> also<00:00:10.170> using<00:00:10.500> the

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
using the land and also using the

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.080 
using the land and also using the
compass<00:00:12.650> map<00:00:13.650> setting<00:00:14.160> is<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.429> fundamental

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:15.090 
compass map setting is the fundamental

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.030 
compass map setting is the fundamental
skill<00:00:15.480> required<00:00:15.960> to<00:00:16.259> navigate<00:00:16.680> around<00:00:16.830> the

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:17.040 
skill required to navigate around the

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.100 
skill required to navigate around the
mountains<00:00:17.460> it's<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.300> first<00:00:18.570> thing<00:00:18.810> that<00:00:19.020> you

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:19.110 
mountains it's the first thing that you

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.170 
mountains it's the first thing that you
should<00:00:19.320> do<00:00:19.560> before<00:00:19.739> you<00:00:20.009> start<00:00:20.130> to<00:00:20.610> set<00:00:20.820> off<00:00:20.970> on

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
should do before you start to set off on

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.019 
should do before you start to set off on
any<00:00:21.390> leg<00:00:21.770> the<00:00:22.770> map<00:00:23.009> is<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.279> view<00:00:23.640> as<00:00:23.759> you<00:00:23.910> would

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
called orientating your map and you're

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.860 
called orientating your map and you're
turning<00:00:55.950> it<00:00:56.100> until<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.520> features<00:00:56.970> marry<00:00:57.660> up

with the features on the land to confirm

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.680 
with the features on the land to confirm
that<00:01:02.250> you've<00:01:02.399> set<00:01:02.700> the<00:01:02.850> map<00:01:03.030> correctly<00:01:03.360> to<00:01:03.660> the

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
that you've set the map correctly to the

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.930 
land you can also use your compass place
your<00:01:07.110> compass<00:01:07.470> on<00:01:07.620> the<00:01:07.740> map<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.220> turn<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.729> map

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:08.940 
your compass on the map and turn the map

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.540 
your compass on the map and turn the map
until<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.630> needle<00:01:09.870> points<00:01:10.500> straight<00:01:10.590> up<00:01:10.920> the

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
until the needle points straight up the

until the needle points straight up the
north/south<00:01:12.090> grid<00:01:12.210> lines<00:01:13.040> that<00:01:14.040> will<00:01:14.159> confirm

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
north/south grid lines that will confirm

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.440 
north/south grid lines that will confirm
that<00:01:14.729> you've<00:01:15.060> set<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.540> map<00:01:15.720> correctly<00:01:17.450> it's

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
that you've set the map correctly it's

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.300 
that you've set the map correctly it's
important<00:01:19.020> that<00:01:19.049> you<00:01:19.290> set<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.710> map<00:01:19.890> with<00:01:20.220> the

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
important that you set the map with the

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.700 
important that you set the map with the
land<00:01:20.549> first<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.390> then<00:01:21.810> use<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.229> compass<00:01:22.680> to

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
land first and then use the compass to

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.030 
land first and then use the compass to
confirm<00:01:23.640> that<00:01:24.450> way<00:01:24.690> the<00:01:24.990> visibility<00:01:25.650> is<00:01:25.799> bad

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
confirm that way the visibility is bad

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.700 
confirm that way the visibility is bad
you<00:01:26.490> will<00:01:26.580> automatically<00:01:27.570> set<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.080> map<00:01:28.380> first

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
you will automatically set the map first

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:36.710 
you will automatically set the map first
and<00:01:29.100> then<00:01:29.640> confirm<00:01:30.090> with<00:01:30.330> the<00:01:30.360> compass<00:01:35.720> it's

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
and then confirm with the compass it's

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.260 
and then confirm with the compass it's
important<00:01:37.470> that<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:37.710> have<00:01:37.920> your<00:01:37.950> map<00:01:38.310> set<00:01:38.670> so

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
important that you have your map set so

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.969 
important that you have your map set so
that<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:39.420> know<00:01:39.659> which<00:01:39.840> direction<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:40.470> travel

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
that you know which direction to travel

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.500 
that you know which direction to travel
to<00:01:41.100> find<00:01:41.369> whatever<00:01:41.700> feature<00:01:42.060> it<00:01:42.240> is<00:01:42.360> that

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.510 
to find whatever feature it is that

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.080 
to find whatever feature it is that
you're<00:01:42.630> looking<00:01:42.930> for<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:44.100> map<00:01:44.340> is<00:01:44.580> a<00:01:44.610> view<00:01:44.940> as

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
you're looking for the map is a view as

you would see it if you were sitting up

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.030 
you would see it if you were sitting up
in<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.619> helicopter<00:01:46.830> looking<00:01:47.790> down<00:01:48.650> to<00:01:49.650> set<00:01:49.860> the
