00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:09.570
 the center of genetics and biology 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.280
 molecular is created in the year 2000 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.190
 the idea is to apply these new 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.860
 knowledge for Peruvian populations 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.050
 we are interested in solving some problems 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:23.820
 related to different diseases 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:26.640
 for example diabetes blindness cancer the 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.590
 hereditary we are also living a 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.570
 project related to 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.180
 implementation of a laboratory 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.980
 genetic diagnosis for diseases 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.110
 neuromuscular that do not exist in 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.880
 our country the people who work 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.250
 in genetics laboratory like this 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.590
 they may cure diseases with their 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.480
 work they may discover some kind 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.340
 of specific diagnosis for 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.650
 illness with which they work and I 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.480
 It seems that this is a job that is very 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.260
 important and what I would like to do in 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.130
 the future 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.790
 apart from that we have projects 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.100
 subsidized by the national 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.630
 geographic there is a project called 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.940
 the genographic project peru 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:07.840
 that coordinates the san martín de porres and 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:10.240
 the idea is to study the around 60 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.670
 different ethnic groups that exist in 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.790
 Peru and see how they are related 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.920
 genetically be part of a 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.350
 laboratory so a little more is added 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.750
 to your résumé whenever you want 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.690
 apply to what is a residence already 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:28.000
 be in that country or in another suddenly I 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.560
 is going to take our center out of the bunch 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.229
 a national and international reference 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.479
 for what is human genetics but that 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:37.930
 It has also made us be 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:39.640
 called not to participate in dealing 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.740
 to solve some problems of our 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.210
 country for example the ministry of 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.520
 agriculture has given us a 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.520
 financing called project in 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:51.100
 goats to make the alpaca genome and 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.660
 solve the problem of the 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.729
 ignorance of the genes that have 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:57.009
 what to do with the improvement of fiber that 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.990
 already makes a person who can investigate 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:00.580
 and come to a conclusion and generate 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.830
 some kind of knowledge that in the 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.070
 future can be published and contribute to 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.940
 the scientific community seems to be 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.940
 It's very important
