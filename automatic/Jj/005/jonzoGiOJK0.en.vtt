out<00:02:37.110> we<00:02:38.110> have<00:02:38.260> some<00:02:38.470> manual<00:02:48.360> just<00:02:49.360> like<00:02:49.950> mini

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
out we have some manual just like mini

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.120 
out we have some manual just like mini
mine

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:01.430 

it<00:02:55.760> looks<00:02:56.000> like<00:02:56.120> it

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.580

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
guess because it got one ear and then

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:17.240 
guess because it got one ear and then
this<00:03:11.310> says<00:03:11.610> Mike<00:03:12.090> on<00:03:12.510> for<00:03:13.410> my<00:03:13.620> cough<00:03:16.250> assume
