00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
for alkaline cells but what we really

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.179 
for alkaline cells but what we really
want<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.330> know<00:01:09.570> is<00:01:09.840> if<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.290> Baptizer<00:01:10.770> can

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
want to know is if the Baptizer can

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.609 
want to know is if the Baptizer can
really<00:01:11.520> recharge<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.210> pair<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.450> double<00:01:12.960> a's<00:01:13.140> -

really recharge a pair of double a's -
they<00:01:13.830> are<00:01:13.890> better<00:01:14.070> than<00:01:14.189> new<00:01:14.549> let's<00:01:15.119> find<00:01:15.390> out

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:19.230 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.890 

for<00:01:19.980> our<00:01:20.130> test<00:01:20.400> we<00:01:20.790> go<00:01:20.940> the<00:01:21.060> last<00:01:21.240> generation

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
for our test we go the last generation

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.320 
for our test we go the last generation
canon<00:01:22.350> camera<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:23.220> uses<00:01:23.370> double-a<00:01:24.000> cells

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
canon camera that uses double-a cells

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.750 
canon camera that uses double-a cells
and<00:01:24.630> made<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.230> shoot<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.620> video<00:01:25.950> clip<00:01:26.190> to<00:01:26.640> the

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:26.760 
and made it shoot a video clip to the

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.910 
and made it shoot a video clip to the
battery<00:01:27.120> ran<00:01:27.300> out<00:01:27.450> here's<00:01:28.290> how<00:01:28.410> we<00:01:28.470> did<00:01:28.680> with

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
battery ran out here's how we did with

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:45.140 
battery ran out here's how we did with
two<00:01:29.190> fresh<00:01:29.460> pairs<00:01:29.760> of<00:01:30.000> Energizer's<00:01:44.150> we

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 
two fresh pairs of Energizer's we

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.450 
two fresh pairs of Energizer's we
recharged<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.960> two<00:01:46.350> sets<00:01:46.620> of<00:01:46.740> batteries<00:01:47.190> and

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
recharged the two sets of batteries and

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.550 
recharged the two sets of batteries and
ran<00:01:47.760> the<00:01:47.940> test<00:01:48.180> again<00:01:48.510> here's<00:01:49.350> how<00:01:49.500> the

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
ran the test again here's how the

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:58.390 
ran the test again here's how the
recharge<00:01:50.130> battery<00:01:50.640> still

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:58.400 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.790 

so<00:01:58.940> it<00:01:59.090> seems<00:01:59.360> three<00:01:59.810> out<00:01:59.930> of<00:01:59.960> four<00:02:00.230> times<00:02:00.290> in

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
so it seems three out of four times in

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.160 
so it seems three out of four times in
our<00:02:00.920> tests<00:02:01.340> the<00:02:01.820> recharge<00:02:02.240> double<00:02:02.600> is<00:02:02.750> did

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
our tests the recharge double is did

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.770 
our tests the recharge double is did
perform<00:02:03.470> marginally<00:02:04.130> better<00:02:04.330> we<00:02:05.330> didn't<00:02:05.630> see

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
perform marginally better we didn't see

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.480 
perform marginally better we didn't see
incredible<00:02:06.410> improvements<00:02:07.070> over<00:02:07.400> the

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
incredible improvements over the

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.370 
incredible improvements over the
recording<00:02:07.940> times<00:02:08.210> given<00:02:08.690> by<00:02:08.810> the<00:02:08.869> batteries

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
recording times given by the batteries

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.160 
recording times given by the batteries
fresh<00:02:09.920> out<00:02:10.130> of<00:02:10.160> the<00:02:10.400> pack<00:02:10.610> but<00:02:11.180> at<00:02:11.360> least<00:02:11.600> means

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
fresh out of the pack but at least means

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.340 
fresh out of the pack but at least means
Beth<00:02:12.500> Heiser<00:02:12.740> was<00:02:13.130> truthful<00:02:13.460> in<00:02:13.850> its<00:02:14.030> claim<00:02:14.350> so

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
Beth Heiser was truthful in its claim so

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:16.990 
Beth Heiser was truthful in its claim so
does<00:02:15.560> that<00:02:15.590> mean<00:02:15.860> you<00:02:16.010> should<00:02:16.040> all<00:02:16.340> switch<00:02:16.760> to

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
does that mean you should all switch to

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.560 
does that mean you should all switch to
alkaline<00:02:17.450> charges<00:02:17.960> such<00:02:18.260> as<00:02:18.290> the<00:02:18.560> Baptizer<00:02:18.950> an

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
ordinary alkaline battery is much

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.830 
ordinary alkaline battery is much
cheaper<00:02:22.250> than<00:02:22.490> an<00:02:23.120> rechargeable<00:02:23.810> nickel

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840

aside from alkaline cells and it only

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.450 
aside from alkaline cells and it only
takes<00:02:41.690> one<00:02:41.780> hour<00:02:42.170> to<00:02:42.320> fully<00:02:42.770> recharge<00:02:43.040> an

power<00:02:45.980> in<00:02:46.400> a<00:02:46.520> hurry<00:02:46.930> but<00:02:47.930> it<00:02:48.020> does<00:02:48.230> cost<00:02:48.470> quite

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:48.710 
power in a hurry but it does cost quite

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.010 
power in a hurry but it does cost quite
a<00:02:48.770> bit<00:02:48.970> ninety-seven<00:02:49.970> Singapore<00:02:50.360> dollars<00:02:50.690> for

a bit ninety-seven Singapore dollars for
the<00:02:51.230> battery<00:02:51.590> charger<00:02:52.220> and<00:02:52.520> two<00:02:52.880> pairs<00:02:53.120> of

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.240 
the battery charger and two pairs of

the battery charger and two pairs of
alkaline<00:02:53.660> batteries<00:02:54.110> the<00:02:54.320> last<00:02:54.530> time<00:02:54.770> we

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
alkaline batteries the last time we

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.610 
alkaline batteries the last time we
checked<00:02:55.010> a<00:02:55.460> sanyo<00:02:56.090> eneloop<00:02:56.300> with<00:02:57.140> two<00:02:57.350> pairs

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
checked a sanyo eneloop with two pairs

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.950 
checked a sanyo eneloop with two pairs
of<00:02:57.770> nickel<00:02:58.130> batteries<00:02:58.580> costs<00:02:59.270> about<00:02:59.420> half<00:02:59.810> of

00:02:59.950 --> 00:02:59.960 
of nickel batteries costs about half of

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.979 
of nickel batteries costs about half of
them<00:03:00.310> so<00:03:01.310> the<00:03:01.430> Baptizer<00:03:01.820> can<00:03:02.210> indeed<00:03:02.540> recharge

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
them so the Baptizer can indeed recharge

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:04.780 
them so the Baptizer can indeed recharge
alkaline<00:03:03.470> batteries<00:03:03.950> and<00:03:04.280> that's<00:03:04.610> quite<00:03:04.760> a

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
alkaline batteries and that's quite a

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.970 
alkaline batteries and that's quite a
good<00:03:05.000> job<00:03:05.060> of<00:03:05.360> it<00:03:05.510> we<00:03:05.720> have<00:03:05.870> to<00:03:06.050> admit<00:03:06.320> but

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
good job of it we have to admit but

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.680 
good job of it we have to admit but
whether<00:03:07.160> it's<00:03:07.370> worth<00:03:07.550> paying<00:03:07.850> the<00:03:08.030> relatively

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
whether it's worth paying the relatively

whether it's worth paying the relatively
high<00:03:09.020> price<00:03:09.350> for<00:03:09.650> one<00:03:09.830> you<00:03:10.459> have<00:03:10.580> to<00:03:10.760> decide

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060
