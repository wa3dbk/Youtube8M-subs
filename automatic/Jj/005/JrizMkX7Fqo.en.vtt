00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:23.760
 is more Calvinistic Calvinists 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:29.900
 to be strong is the defense of the 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.900
 election a and of god's sovereignty 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:38.070
 certainly believe that there is a great 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:45.199
 difference between embracing an error 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:50.010
 technological and heresy Calvinism 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:52.739
 explains the first to say 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.289
 principles of the process 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.760
 salvation that we are dead in 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:01.559
 our sins until God gives us 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.719
 ability to see what Jesus said to 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.790
 and we can fill a field four that 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.700
 He said it is necessary for the year 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.280
 new to be able to see the kingdom 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.590
 Then where does this faith come from? 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.380
 Speak that faith is a gift from God that speaks 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:20.579
 good of us so that no one will hold 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:23.420
 but faith is a gift then that faith that we 

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:25.890
 we receive from God comes before our 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:29.100
 confession well before we can 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.090
 even embrace it as our Lord 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.530
 and savior 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.360
 whether you have to do a work in 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:41.399
 our lives for which we respond 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:43.710
 we respond in faith and someone can be 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:46.439
 saved and not cercal old age it is clear that 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.880
 Can you guys need it if you have faith? 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.340
 in jesus christ as lord and savior 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.500
 you may not understand why because 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.890
 the hair explains why this 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:59.189
 happened but the fact that it happens is the 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.990
 that causes you to be saved. 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.780
 You deposit your faith in Jesus Christ. 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.680
 as your only Lord and Savior be 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:10.979
 ammian is a Calvinist is certainly 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:13.890
 salvation is in Jesus Christ and not by 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.860
 cause of this doctrine that I believe is 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.620
 important 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:22.530
 certainly certainly essential 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.910
 because it is the doctrine that gives more glory to 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:29.870
 God that best qualifies you 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:33.650
 and that it values more the gospel 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.360
 now can be Christian and does not communicate 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.660
 of course you can 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.340
 much of today's church and arm ana 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:44.890
 go to heaven because they believe in jesus 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.890
 christ as your only lord and savior
