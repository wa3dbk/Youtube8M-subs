the points that I wanted to cover were
zero<00:00:58.210> basis<00:00:59.970> level<00:01:00.970> 17<00:01:01.560> and<00:01:02.560> these<00:01:02.680> are<00:01:02.860> going

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
zero basis level 17 and these are going

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.780 
zero basis level 17 and these are going
to<00:01:03.160> 17<00:01:04.680> placement<00:01:05.680> of<00:01:05.710> the<00:01:05.830> heroes<00:01:06.100> these

top<00:01:16.210> three<00:01:16.479> on<00:01:16.570> bottom<00:01:17.880> I<00:01:20.760> have<00:01:22.170> three<00:01:23.170> ranged

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
top three on bottom I have three ranged

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.859 
top three on bottom I have three ranged
here<00:01:23.950> i<00:01:23.979> love<00:01:24.310> my<00:01:24.430> druid<00:01:24.729> in<00:01:24.880> the<00:01:24.940> middle<00:01:25.240> I

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
here i love my druid in the middle I

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:27.719 
here i love my druid in the middle I
think<00:01:26.410> it's<00:01:26.500> really<00:01:26.619> important<00:01:27.100> to<00:01:27.460> put<00:01:27.610> the

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
think it's really important to put the

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:28.920 
think it's really important to put the
fruit<00:01:27.910> in<00:01:28.090> the<00:01:28.180> middle<00:01:28.450> so<00:01:28.570> you<00:01:28.630> can<00:01:28.780> have

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
fruit in the middle so you can have

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.660 
fruit in the middle so you can have
access<00:01:29.229> to<00:01:30.900> both<00:01:31.900> sides<00:01:32.200> if<00:01:32.830> you<00:01:32.979> can<00:01:33.130> see<00:01:33.340> here

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
access to both sides if you can see here

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.240 
access to both sides if you can see here
that<00:01:33.899> range<00:01:34.899> comes<00:01:35.410> just<00:01:35.590> outside<00:01:35.920> the<00:01:36.070> wall

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
that range comes just outside the wall

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.219 
that range comes just outside the wall
on<00:01:36.550> the<00:01:36.700> top<00:01:36.910> and<00:01:37.149> just<00:01:37.479> outside<00:01:37.840> the<00:01:37.990> wall<00:01:38.140> on

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
on the top and just outside the wall on

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:44.100 
on the top and just outside the wall on
the<00:01:38.320> bottom<00:01:40.649> and<00:01:42.360> I<00:01:43.360> also<00:01:43.509> think<00:01:43.720> it's<00:01:43.899> really

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
the bottom and I also think it's really

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.870 
the bottom and I also think it's really
important<00:01:44.530> to<00:01:44.590> put<00:01:45.040> your<00:01:45.190> drew<00:01:45.430> it<00:01:45.550> on<00:01:45.670> your

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
important to put your drew it on your

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.660 
important to put your drew it on your
highest<00:01:46.270> level<00:01:46.360> hero<00:01:46.780> base<00:01:47.070> that's<00:01:48.070> probably

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
highest level hero base that's probably

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.249 
highest level hero base that's probably
one<00:01:48.910> of<00:01:48.940> the<00:01:49.060> most<00:01:49.180> crucial<00:01:49.479> things<00:01:49.869> that<00:01:50.170> you

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
one of the most crucial things that you

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:52.139 
one of the most crucial things that you
can<00:01:50.410> do<00:01:50.530> is<00:01:50.649> put<00:01:50.860> your<00:01:50.890> druid<00:01:51.430> on<00:01:51.640> the<00:01:51.820> highest

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:52.149 
can do is put your druid on the highest

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:54.780 
can do is put your druid on the highest
level<00:01:52.660> hero<00:01:52.869> basically<00:01:53.290> you<00:01:53.350> have<00:01:53.670> just<00:01:54.670> to

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790 
level hero basically you have just to

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.880 
level hero basically you have just to
optimize<00:01:55.270> his<00:01:55.509> heel<00:01:55.780> you'll<00:01:56.440> get<00:01:56.530> the<00:01:56.680> biggest

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
optimize his heel you'll get the biggest

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.059 
optimize his heel you'll get the biggest
deals<00:01:57.840> while<00:01:58.840> you<00:01:59.020> sitting<00:01:59.080> there<00:01:59.500> on<00:01:59.709> the

00:02:00.059 --> 00:02:00.069 
deals while you sitting there on the

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:05.679 
deals while you sitting there on the
highest<00:02:00.429> your<00:02:00.729> base

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:08.270 

so<00:02:06.689> I<00:02:06.719> have<00:02:07.020> spirit<00:02:07.469> mage<00:02:07.590> here<00:02:07.829> in<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.039> top

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
so I have spirit mage here in the top

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.210 
so I have spirit mage here in the top
and<00:02:08.489> keep<00:02:09.420> it<00:02:09.569> here<00:02:09.780> on<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.769> far<00:02:11.930> far<00:02:12.930> right

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
and keep it here on the far far right

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.110 
and keep it here on the far far right
with<00:02:14.220> APD<00:02:14.879> and<00:02:15.150> a<00:02:15.209> TD<00:02:15.390> here<00:02:15.810> I<00:02:16.489> like<00:02:17.489> the<00:02:17.610> TG<00:02:17.940> in

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
with APD and a TD here I like the TG in

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.180 
with APD and a TD here I like the TG in
this<00:02:18.269> point<00:02:18.599> on<00:02:19.170> that<00:02:19.470> hero<00:02:19.680> base<00:02:19.890> there

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
this point on that hero base there

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.720 
this point on that hero base there
because<00:02:20.760> he<00:02:20.970> hops<00:02:21.180> over<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.510> wall<00:02:21.690> here<00:02:21.900> and

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
because he hops over the wall here and

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.190 
because he hops over the wall here and
gives<00:02:23.730> them<00:02:23.849> a<00:02:23.879> chance<00:02:23.910> to<00:02:24.209> charge<00:02:24.450> us<00:02:24.660> broxton

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
gives them a chance to charge us broxton

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.460

normal<00:03:11.190> resource<00:03:11.519> square<00:03:12.139> so<00:03:13.139> a<00:03:13.170> normal

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
normal resource square so a normal

just enough hero traps I like to put on

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.390 
just enough hero traps I like to put on
the<00:04:28.360> insides<00:04:28.780> here<00:04:29.080> between<00:04:29.319> the<00:04:29.590> towers

bonds obviously heroes and I like them
to<00:04:37.780> hit<00:04:37.990> when<00:04:38.259> the<00:04:38.289> heroes<00:04:38.620> on<00:04:38.800> the<00:04:38.919> insides

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
to hit when the heroes on the insides

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.929 
to hit when the heroes on the insides
when<00:04:39.490> they<00:04:39.580> wrap<00:04:39.759> around<00:04:39.789> the<00:04:40.689> aisles<00:04:41.169> here<00:04:41.439> I

when they wrap around the aisles here I

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:47.159 
when they wrap around the aisles here I
it's<00:04:42.939> just<00:04:43.150> it's<00:04:43.300> more<00:04:43.389> more<00:04:43.990> optimal<00:04:46.169> so

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:47.169 
it's just it's more more optimal so
