morning<00:00:07.140> I<00:00:07.170> thought<00:00:07.200> I'd<00:00:07.440> go<00:00:07.529> through

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
morning I thought I'd go through

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.470 
morning I thought I'd go through
something<00:00:07.980> kind<00:00:08.340> of<00:00:08.400> interesting<00:00:08.490> my<00:00:09.300> wife

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
something kind of interesting my wife

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.360 
something kind of interesting my wife
asked<00:00:09.809> me<00:00:09.900> for<00:00:10.139> a<00:00:10.170> small<00:00:10.469> application<00:00:11.130> that

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
asked me for a small application that

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.850 
asked me for a small application that
would<00:00:11.490> allow<00:00:11.700> her<00:00:12.090> to<00:00:12.269> play<00:00:12.509> itunes<00:00:12.860> specific

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
would allow her to play itunes specific

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.919 
would allow her to play itunes specific
playlist<00:00:14.280> in<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:15.059> morning<00:00:15.330> as<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.690> alarm

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
playlist in the morning as the alarm

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.320 
playlist in the morning as the alarm
clock<00:00:16.100> instead<00:00:17.100> of<00:00:17.430> having<00:00:17.670> set<00:00:18.029> an<00:00:18.119> alarm

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
clock instead of having set an alarm

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.720 
clock instead of having set an alarm
manually<00:00:18.900> so<00:00:19.619> I<00:00:19.859> figured<00:00:20.220> I'd<00:00:20.310> write<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.520> little

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
manually so I figured I'd write a little

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.939 
manually so I figured I'd write a little
script<00:00:20.789> to<00:00:21.210> do<00:00:21.330> that<00:00:21.539> and<00:00:21.750> what<00:00:22.500> I<00:00:22.529> did<00:00:22.740> is<00:00:22.769> I

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
script to do that and what I did is I

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.470 
script to do that and what I did is I
went<00:00:22.980> in<00:00:23.189> here<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:23.490> created<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:23.820> small<00:00:23.939> domain

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
went in here and created a small domain

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.990 
went in here and created a small domain
model<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:25.019> it's<00:00:25.949> going<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:26.369> run<00:00:26.519> a<00:00:26.550> small<00:00:26.789> talk

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
model and it's going to run a small talk

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000 
model and it's going to run a small talk
process<00:00:27.449> that<00:00:27.660> will<00:00:27.750> check<00:00:27.990> every<00:00:28.260> couple<00:00:28.890> of

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
process that will check every couple of

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.500 
process that will check every couple of
minutes<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.369> see<00:00:29.580> if<00:00:29.699> it's<00:00:29.849> time<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.179> be<00:00:30.269> alarm

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
minutes and see if it's time to be alarm

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.720 
minutes and see if it's time to be alarm
to<00:00:30.599> go<00:00:30.630> off<00:00:30.750> that's<00:00:31.050> pretty<00:00:31.470> basic<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:31.949> then

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
to go off that's pretty basic and then

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.580 
to go off that's pretty basic and then
it's<00:00:32.880> going<00:00:33.030> to<00:00:33.120> go<00:00:33.270> ahead<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.690> dump<00:00:34.350> out<00:00:34.559> a

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
it's going to go ahead and dump out a

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.920 
it's going to go ahead and dump out a
script<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:35.340> execute<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.239> script<00:00:36.420> now<00:00:36.719> I<00:00:36.750> know

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
script and execute the script now I know

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.389 
script and execute the script now I know
there<00:00:37.170> are<00:00:37.230> other<00:00:37.350> ways<00:00:37.559> of<00:00:37.710> doing<00:00:38.040> this<00:00:38.070> I

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
there are other ways of doing this I

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.790 
there are other ways of doing this I
think<00:00:38.879> you<00:00:39.059> can<00:00:39.270> streams<00:00:39.600> straight<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.469> itunes

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
think you can streams straight to itunes

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.560 
think you can streams straight to itunes
for<00:00:41.010> instance<00:00:41.340> with<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.550> applescript<00:00:42.180> but

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
for instance with the applescript but

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.630 
for instance with the applescript but
I'm<00:00:42.960> just<00:00:43.140> dumping<00:00:43.379> out<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:43.530> file<00:00:43.860> because<00:00:44.280> it's

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
I'm just dumping out a file because it's

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.100 
I'm just dumping out a file because it's
easier<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.030> it<00:00:45.180> allows<00:00:45.390> me<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.629> look<00:00:45.750> at<00:00:45.960> it

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
easier and it allows me to look at it

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.810 
easier and it allows me to look at it
and<00:00:46.170> run<00:00:46.350> it<00:00:46.379> outside<00:00:46.920> of<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.309> environment<00:00:47.760> if

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
and run it outside of the environment if

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.970 
and run it outside of the environment if
I<00:00:47.910> want<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.180> so<00:00:48.989> I'll<00:00:49.200> take<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.410> look<00:00:49.620> at<00:00:49.739> what<00:00:49.860> we

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
I want to so I'll take a look at what we

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.189 
I want to so I'll take a look at what we
did<00:00:50.190> here<00:00:50.489> go<00:00:51.329> in<00:00:51.420> here<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:51.629> create<00:00:52.020> the

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
did here go in here and create the

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.799 
did here go in here and create the
script<00:00:52.530> all<00:00:52.739> I<00:00:52.800> do<00:00:52.980> is<00:00:53.100> run<00:00:54.059> this<00:00:54.239> little<00:00:54.539> apple

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
script all I do is run this little apple

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.410 
script all I do is run this little apple

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
script tell application iTunes activate

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.700 
script tell application iTunes activate
that<00:00:57.629> way<00:00:57.780> in<00:00:57.899> case<00:00:57.960> it's<00:00:58.289> not<00:00:58.410> actually

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
that way in case it's not actually

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.130 
that way in case it's not actually
running<00:00:58.890> it'll<00:00:59.100> come<00:00:59.280> up<00:00:59.600> play<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.629> playlist

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
running it'll come up play a playlist

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.660 
running it'll come up play a playlist
and<00:01:01.320> I<00:01:01.379> have<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.530> little<00:01:01.680> user<00:01:01.949> interface<00:01:02.489> that

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
and I have a little user interface that

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.729 
and I have a little user interface that
allows<00:01:02.789> me<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.120> specify<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.690> playlist<00:01:04.199> and

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
allows me to specify the playlist and

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.500 
allows me to specify the playlist and
just<00:01:04.920> end<00:01:05.100> tell<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:06.060> at<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.240> end<00:01:06.270> of<00:01:06.450> that

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
just end tell and at the end of that

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.899 
just end tell and at the end of that
change<00:01:07.049> that<00:01:07.229> script<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.560> be<00:01:07.650> 755<00:01:08.310> so<00:01:08.729> those

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
change that script to be 755 so those

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.000 
change that script to be 755 so those
will<00:01:09.000> go<00:01:09.060> ahead<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.390> run<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:09.810> in<00:01:10.470> run<00:01:10.650> script

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
will go ahead and run and in run script

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.429 
will go ahead and run and in run script
just<00:01:11.460> go<00:01:11.640> ahead<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:11.790> execute<00:01:12.150> it<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.510> alarm

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
just go ahead and execute it the alarm

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.660 
just go ahead and execute it the alarm
clock<00:01:13.619> part<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.070> this<00:01:14.159> is<00:01:14.310> actually<00:01:14.640> very

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
clock part of this is actually very

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.330 
clock part of this is actually very
basic<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.810> come<00:01:16.020> in<00:01:16.170> here<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.590> you<00:01:16.680> have<00:01:16.890> a

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
basic you come in here and you have a

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.460 
basic you come in here and you have a
couple<00:01:17.759> of<00:01:17.850> buttons<00:01:18.090> where<00:01:18.479> I<00:01:18.780> allow<00:01:19.259> you<00:01:19.320> to

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
couple of buttons where I allow you to

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.670 
couple of buttons where I allow you to
set<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.799> alarm<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.390> then<00:01:21.390> set<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.290> playlist

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
set the alarm and then set the playlist

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.260 
set the alarm and then set the playlist
down<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.950> model<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.340> start<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.030> alarm

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
down the model and start the alarm

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.420 
down the model and start the alarm
process<00:01:24.689> so<00:01:25.320> let's<00:01:25.470> go<00:01:25.619> ahead<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:25.920> take<00:01:26.189> a

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
process so let's go ahead and take a

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.510 
process so let's go ahead and take a
look<00:01:26.610> at<00:01:26.759> what<00:01:26.790> that<00:01:26.909> looks<00:01:27.060> like<00:01:28.070> so<00:01:29.070> I'll<00:01:29.369> do

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
look at what that looks like so I'll do

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.710 
look at what that looks like so I'll do

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
UI all I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.370 
UI all I'm going to do is I'm going to
go<00:01:36.119> in<00:01:36.240> here<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.479> set<00:01:36.750> this<00:01:36.900> time<00:01:37.140> I've

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.370 
default of this to eight hours in the

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
future because the idea is it going to

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:47.499 
future because the idea is it going to
run<00:01:40.470> at<00:01:40.590> night<00:01:40.619> so<00:01:41.520> let's<00:01:41.670> just<00:01:41.909> say<00:01:42.090> I<00:01:42.420> 100<00:01:42.890> 936

and<00:02:53.400> well<00:02:53.490> that's<00:02:53.670> not<00:02:53.820> terribly<00:02:54.210> difficult

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
and well that's not terribly difficult

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.630 
and well that's not terribly difficult
it's<00:02:55.290> a<00:02:55.590> little<00:02:55.860> more<00:02:56.070> owners<00:02:56.400> and<00:02:56.580> it

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
it's a little more owners and it

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.190 
it's a little more owners and it
requires<00:02:56.940> loading<00:02:57.390> a<00:02:57.450> lot<00:02:57.600> more<00:02:57.780> stuff<00:02:58.020> into

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
requires loading a lot more stuff into

requires loading a lot more stuff into
the<00:02:58.320> environment
