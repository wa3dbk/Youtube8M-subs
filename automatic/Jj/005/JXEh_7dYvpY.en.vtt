the<00:01:16.799> United<00:01:17.040> States<00:01:17.250> right<00:01:17.549> so<00:01:17.880> that<00:01:18.600> is

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
the United States right so that is

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.200 
the United States right so that is
another<00:01:19.110> obstacle<00:01:19.560> against<00:01:20.009> him<00:01:20.159> but<00:01:20.880> just

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
another obstacle against him but just

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.310 
another obstacle against him but just
him<00:01:21.390> running<00:01:21.930> I<00:01:22.080> think<00:01:22.470> really<00:01:23.060> represents

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
him running I think really represents

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.380 
him running I think really represents
that<00:01:25.320> he<00:01:25.830> isn't<00:01:26.040> against<00:01:26.580> government<00:01:27.150> he's

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
that he isn't against government he's

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.090 
that he isn't against government he's
just<00:01:27.630> against<00:01:28.049> government<00:01:28.560> corruption<00:01:28.799> in

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
just against government corruption in

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.560 
just against government corruption in
bad<00:01:29.340> government<00:01:29.729> right<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.270> that's<00:01:30.390> what

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
bad government right and that's what

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.969 
bad government right and that's what
WikiLeaks<00:01:30.960> is<00:01:31.049> all<00:01:31.200> about<00:01:31.380> we<00:01:31.560> open

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
there's there's that side of it which i

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.700 
there's there's that side of it which i
think<00:01:36.090> is<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.270> positive<00:01:36.509> you<00:01:37.020> know<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.350> then

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
think is a positive you know and then

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.679 
think is a positive you know and then
the<00:01:37.799> other<00:01:37.829> positive<00:01:38.280> is<00:01:38.340> just<00:01:38.520> if<00:01:39.000> he<00:01:39.570> were<00:01:39.659> to

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
the other positive is just if he were to

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.149 
the other positive is just if he were to
win<00:01:39.810> or<00:01:40.049> just<00:01:40.200> him<00:01:40.320> running<00:01:40.680> it<00:01:40.770> just

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
win or just him running it just

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.520 
win or just him running it just
continues<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.640> put<00:01:41.939> pressure<00:01:42.180> on<00:01:42.570> those
