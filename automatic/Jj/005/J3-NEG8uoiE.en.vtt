00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:05.150
Maybe zoos are a good thing for animals.

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:12.849
This is a story about a young man named Piscine
Patel, or Pi, whose family owns a zoo in India.

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:17.560
Growing up, Pi is interested in religion and
so he converts to each of the major religions:

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.230
Christianity, Islam, and Hinduism.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.119
The family decides to move to Canada, but
on the way there, their ship sinks and Pi

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:32.180
finds himself on a lifeboat with a tiger,
Richard Parker, a hyena, a zebra, and an orangutan.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.150
Pi manages to keep himself separated from
the other animals and can only watch as the

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.970
hyena kills the zebra and orangutan.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.830
Pi fears that he will be killed next, but
the tiger kills the hyena.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.840
Pi decides to build an adjoining raft that
is connected to the lifeboat by rope and luckily

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.830
finds survival supplies, such as food and
water.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.710
Instead of waiting for the tiger to die, Pi
decides he must train the tiger to ensure

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.400
his own personal survival.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.980
Pi learns to fish and begins feeding the tiger,
slowly training and taming him.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:09.080
As food and water supplies dwindle, Pi struggles
with health issues, like sores and dehydration.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.250
He also becomes temporarily blind.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.250
Pi encounters another blind man who is also
floating on a boat.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.300
However, the man comes aboard and the tiger
eats him.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.159
When Pi’s eyesight returns, he sees an island
in the distance.

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.450
He arrives on the island and finds algae that
he can eat.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.540
The island has fresh water and is home to
a large meerkat colony who eat fish.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.630
Life on the island is great, but then Pi realizes
that the algae is carnivorous and so he gets

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.540
back on the boat with the tiger and heads
off.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.600
The boat eventually reaches Mexico and Pi
is rescued.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:48.180
In the end, Pi is questioned by investigators
about his journey and despite being skeptical,

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.840
they believe his story.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.500
As always, a lot can be said about this story,
but what draws my interest and attention is

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:00.040
the idea of how a zoo can actually be more
beneficial for a wild animal than the wild.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.890
Pi goes to great lengths to explain how harsh
conditions are for wild animals and how nice

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.850
life in a zoo really is.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.420
We tend to have a romantic sense of what the
wild is like for animals, but the reality

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.599
is that animals in the wild are either looking
for food or trying not to be food for something

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:18.599
else.

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:23.230
It seems like a stressful existence in the
wild, where each day could be your last and

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.940
you are literally playing a game of life or
death.

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.680
And most humans wouldn’t be able to survive
in the wild, especially since we’ve modernized

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.840
ourselves to the luxuries of technology and
civilization.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.900
This also brings a greater appreciation to
what we, as humans, have done with our food

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.200
and safety needs: bringing them closer to
us in a more controlled environment.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.310
It’s comforting to know that our food is
about twenty feet away from us whenever I

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.499
want and if we run out of food, we can go
to a building that has more food for us to

00:02:56.499 --> 00:02:57.499
buy.

00:02:57.499 --> 00:03:02.309
We and our possessions are safe from the weather
and we don’t need to worry about being attacked

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:03.489
by predators.

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:08.329
So while it may seem lonely that the animals
in zoos are confined to a limited space, we

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:13.139
are looking at them through eyes of a species
that has, for the most part, everything it

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:14.669
needs within reach.

00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:21.250
We are smart enough to understand that protecting
ourselves and surviving that way is far greater

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.890
than being free in the wild and nature.

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.340
