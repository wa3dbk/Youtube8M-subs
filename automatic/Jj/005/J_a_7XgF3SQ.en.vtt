things that you should approve on I have

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:18.940 
things that you should approve on I have
to<00:03:17.810> think<00:03:18.110> about<00:03:18.230> this<00:03:18.410> because<00:03:18.530> I<00:03:18.680> really<00:03:18.890> do

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
to think about this because I really do

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.130 
to think about this because I really do
love<00:03:19.070> your<00:03:19.220> videos<00:03:19.460> and<00:03:19.640> then<00:03:20.240> I'm<00:03:20.840> just<00:03:21.020> kind

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
love your videos and then I'm just kind

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.170 
love your videos and then I'm just kind
of<00:03:21.170> came<00:03:21.350> to<00:03:21.530> me<00:03:21.560> one<00:03:22.190> thing<00:03:22.370> that<00:03:22.580> I'm<00:03:22.700> not

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
of came to me one thing that I'm not

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:24.550 
of came to me one thing that I'm not
really<00:03:23.360> fond<00:03:23.660> of<00:03:23.750> in<00:03:23.870> your<00:03:23.990> videos<00:03:24.200> are<00:03:24.380> the

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
really fond of in your videos are the

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.980 
really fond of in your videos are the
kind<00:03:24.860> of<00:03:24.950> awkward<00:03:25.400> pauses<00:03:25.880> and<00:03:26.300> I<00:03:26.660> think<00:03:26.870> that

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:26.990 
kind of awkward pauses and I think that

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:28.570 
kind of awkward pauses and I think that
you<00:03:27.080> should<00:03:27.110> start<00:03:27.620> scripting<00:03:27.980> some<00:03:28.400> of<00:03:28.490> your

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
you should start scripting some of your

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.640 
you should start scripting some of your
reviews<00:03:28.730> like<00:03:29.150> I<00:03:29.270> skipped<00:03:29.720> some<00:03:29.900> things<00:03:30.140> this

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
reviews like I skipped some things this

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:31.960 
reviews like I skipped some things this
is<00:03:30.830> actually<00:03:31.160> not<00:03:31.250> being<00:03:31.430> scripted<00:03:31.640> this

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
is actually not being scripted this

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.550 
is actually not being scripted this
whole<00:03:32.150> entire<00:03:32.240> video<00:03:32.510> but<00:03:32.720> writing<00:03:33.230> scripts

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
whole entire video but writing scripts

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.930 
whole entire video but writing scripts
is<00:03:33.680> very<00:03:33.860> helpful<00:03:34.100> because<00:03:34.430> there's<00:03:34.880> no

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
is very helpful because there's no

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.200 
is very helpful because there's no
awkward<00:03:35.120> pauses<00:03:35.480> and<00:03:35.990> also<00:03:36.290> the<00:03:37.250> sound<00:03:37.970> on

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:38.210 
awkward pauses and also the sound on

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:39.910 
awkward pauses and also the sound on
your<00:03:38.330> video<00:03:38.540> sometimes<00:03:39.140> is<00:03:39.320> not<00:03:39.350> the<00:03:39.680> greatest

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
your video sometimes is not the greatest

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.290 
your video sometimes is not the greatest
because<00:03:40.400> sometimes<00:03:40.910> it's<00:03:41.060> loud<00:03:41.270> and

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.300 
because sometimes it's loud and

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.330 
because sometimes it's loud and
sometimes<00:03:41.870> it's<00:03:42.050> quiet<00:03:42.380> i'm<00:03:42.620> not<00:03:42.740> sure<00:03:42.920> if<00:03:43.010> you

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
sometimes it's quiet i'm not sure if you

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.520 
sometimes it's quiet i'm not sure if you
