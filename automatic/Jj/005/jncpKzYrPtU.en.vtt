and<00:00:48.660> we've<00:00:49.320> got<00:00:50.090> on<00:00:51.090> other<00:00:51.449> side<00:00:52.250> he<00:00:53.250> actually

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
and we've got on other side he actually

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.160 
and we've got on other side he actually
had<00:00:54.239> a

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170

00:01:04.679 --> 00:01:04.689 
circuit board right here with um with

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:13.060 
circuit board right here with um with
exposed<00:01:05.740> wires<00:01:07.810> so<00:01:08.810> I'm<00:01:09.740> and<00:01:09.979> this<00:01:11.350> little<00:01:12.350> cap

cannot make it come up see that push the

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.559 
cannot make it come up see that push the
button<00:01:28.549> and<00:01:28.759> it<00:01:29.710> pops<00:01:30.710> up<00:01:30.979> I<00:01:31.360> don't<00:01:32.360> know<00:01:32.450> if

00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:32.569 
button and it pops up I don't know if

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:36.039 
button and it pops up I don't know if
you<00:01:32.659> can<00:01:32.810> see<00:01:33.020> that<00:01:33.159> just<00:01:34.159> smash<00:01:34.520> it<00:01:34.580> down<00:01:35.049> so
