00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 hello everyone is welcome to 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.279
 this new video is bibi300 that's it 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.099
 is we getting ready for the arrival of 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.840
 assassin's creed 3 so before you 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.580
 actually propose the boxing name of 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.380
 the freedom 2 edition of assassin's creed 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.000
 3 well I decided to show you in 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.920
 does this kind of little statuettes 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.900
 which I received then who is 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.189
 completely different from the one there 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.529
 will have in the freedom edition 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.460
 that's why I was interested in 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.990
 to see a little bit of that 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.160
 give on this model there since you 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.650
 go see it's a model that changes a 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.609
 little bit so already at the level of the 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.009
 box you still see that 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.340
 it's a pretty big box 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.170
 so King is well packed between 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.140
 quotation marks even if after good it remains of the 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.820
 rather low-end paper and so that's it 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.860
 in fact you must know that the figurine 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.550
 which one inside is that north 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:50.129
 on the tree on a piece of trees so 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.860
 which in fact changes radically from that 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.860
 we have in the radical but opposite 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.210
 spoke but that changes in any case by 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.289
 compared to that of the freedom edition of 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.059
 what to have a little what it gives 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.350
 inside so that's gone we're going 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.350
 die this folder 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:19.760
 without mercy and that's all there is to see you 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.160
 already there nothing like that I want to say 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.470
 it looks pretty classy that's for sure 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.730
 that seen so we say that to the air when 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.990
 even of quite good quality but 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.740
 now what interests us is 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.810
 able to see what's at 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:34.370
 the good interior then is always a 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:36.560
 little thing to take on top 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:40.010
 kind of little tights well boring you 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.590
 put three lead to remove and especially 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:50.450
 avoid removing all the paper that 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:54.910
 side of which so the colon have since 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:02:00.040
 and it left her instruction is removed 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:00.040
 in any case already salert to be seymour 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:13.510
 so here's the relay box in 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.510
 waiting i'm going to remove the plastics 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.190
 and we're going to be able to take it off 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.620
 so always of course the species of 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.240
 little things to remove here I do not know 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.250
 if you see it right here it's that kind 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.930
 little things took her away that supports 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:39.760
 in fact directly the the statuette 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.580
 there I do not say we level packaging is 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.960
 clear that they have always tried to 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.770
 make sure to do something 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:50.500
 that does not break easily that removes itself 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.500
 no or anything to say I did not 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:58.630
 not regret that this personally 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:03:02.560
 having rest to the and after that will be good 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:05.650
 wine he removed the famous statuette 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.860
 and so here 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:12.430
 ah yeah ah yeah it's class 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:15.070
 honestly I am I am pretty good 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.390
 pleased with the quality of the statue being 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.310
 because frankly she looks 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.760
 really but really very good 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.400
 quality 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.980
 what I'm going to do is I'm going 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.380
 get closer with the camera and we're going 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:29.110
 do a little tour of the owner 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:33.090
 it's gone so you can see 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:36.459
 still at the level of the year 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.420
 the span of the dimension I would say 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.560
 so it's a statuette that is when 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.600
 even big enough 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.920
 that's something in any case 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:46.390
 still quite appreciable 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.790
 representation it looks anyway 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:51.700
 really quite ok with anyway 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.950
 a lot of details about the statuette 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.739
 as a general rule will make it true that there 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.269
 on that I have not been by there I 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:00.700
 not clearly disappointed from this point of view 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:02.860
 there we go anyway that high level a 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.500
 detail is still really good 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.030
 at all so that's rather a good 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.870
 thing but on the other hand I think that 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.810
 face level 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:13.170
 good yeah at the level of the face you see 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.160
 it's not so bad unfortunately 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.120
 but after that I would say that 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.780
 in a general way 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.190
 good it's going to connect to the clearly it's going 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.290
 except for the face 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.440
 yeah the statue was still 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.150
 really 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.930
 very very very good quality i find 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:34.100
 with really a lot of care 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:39.680
 brought to the characters and therefore to 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:41.660
 so level of costume boots of 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.250
 gloves and it's now 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.290
 frankly here you have seen that 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.930
 it was really not bad 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:50.120
 at all ah yeah no here on I'm 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.830
 enough I'm pretty happy clearly 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.890
 I'm pretty happy so she weighs 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:56.330
 still some weight I would not 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:58.610
 tell you exactly how much but that's 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.040
 sure she weighs some weight she 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:06.290
 is pretty much I'm saying pretty much 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:09.620
 as large as that of that of 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:14.660
 assassin an assassin's creed 1 I think 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:17.210
 to a way to say true I think it will be 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:19.910
 pretty much at last I speak well of all 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:22.970
 ie the trees understood if not 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:24.110
 it's true that otherwise it's true that the 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:26.140
 figurine in itself is still 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:28.310
 pretty small but I mean the 

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:29.690
 representation in itself does little 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:31.360
 near the size of assassins so 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:34.790
 so here's no frankly I'm pretty 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:38.060
 I am quite happy with the detail at 

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:41.090
 level of this of this statue is so 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.680
 which is worth about 20 30 euros I know 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:45.919
 more exactly I think it's 30 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:48.080
 yeah 25 30 so that's good honestly 

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:49.910
 for that price we still have a 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:53.360
 quality statuette I prefer when 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:57.880
 even the show it's true that there 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:06:00.080
 on it we are not we are not really 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:01.340
 screw on the goods I would say 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.320
 it's not like some figurines 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.000
 we were not waiting until 100 or 110 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.550
 euros and who does not feel much 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.740
 no there on that it really remains at a 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.250
 little girl of a statuette pardon two 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.870
 qualities 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:13.280
