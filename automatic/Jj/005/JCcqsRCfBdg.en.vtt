I'll<00:03:28.879> have<00:03:29.010> to<00:03:29.129> try<00:03:29.280> and<00:03:29.450> I'm<00:03:29.840> it's

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:30.159 
I'll have to try and I'm it's

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:31.320 
I'll have to try and I'm it's
just<00:03:30.390> a<00:03:30.430> flat<00:03:30.900> top<00:03:31.209> 10

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.720 
just a flat top 10

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.400 
just a flat top 10
have<00:03:32.220> these<00:03:32.530> white<00:03:33.000> really<00:03:33.400> long

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.599

slightly<00:03:38.360> russians<00:03:38.760> and<00:03:38.930> I<00:03:38.980> think<00:03:39.299> he

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:39.510 
slightly russians and I think he

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:40.610 
slightly russians and I think he
is<00:03:39.769> not<00:03:39.920> priceless

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:41.010 
is not priceless

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.350 
is not priceless
I'm<00:03:41.330> a<00:03:41.430> 650<00:03:42.319> and<00:03:42.440> then<00:03:42.840> this<00:03:43.019> is<00:03:43.209> just

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.750 
I'm a 650 and then this is just

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:44.470 
I'm a 650 and then this is just
an<00:03:43.890> all-over

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.870 
an all-over

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.669 
an all-over
face<00:03:45.090> brush<00:03:45.450> which<00:03:45.680> I<00:03:45.769> have<00:03:46.000> not<00:03:46.190> used

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:47.069 
face brush which I have not used

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:48.310 
face brush which I have not used
but<00:03:47.549> I<00:03:47.599> would<00:03:47.860> just<00:03:47.980> use<00:03:48.209> this<00:03:48.310> for

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.670 
but I would just use this for

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.019 
but I would just use this for
find<00:03:49.040> you<00:03:49.159> know<00:03:49.390> powder<00:03:49.750> or<00:03:50.019> maybe

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:50.299 
find you know powder or maybe

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:51.629 
find you know powder or maybe
even<00:03:50.780> last<00:03:51.150> because<00:03:51.340> this<00:03:51.489> is<00:03:51.629> really

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:51.890 
even last because this is really

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:52.360 
even last because this is really
big<00:03:52.360> and

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.760 
big and

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.180 
big and
this<00:03:53.220> piece<00:03:53.459> of<00:03:53.760> this<00:03:53.909> is<00:03:54.080> the<00:03:54.180> first

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.450 
this piece of this is the first

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:55.530 
this piece of this is the first
time<00:03:54.519> actually<00:03:55.040> touching<00:03:55.360> on<00:03:55.530> my

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.610 
time actually touching on my

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.660 
time actually touching on my
hand

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:56.060 
hand

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.979 
hand

00:03:59.979 --> 00:04:00.379 
that was only 950

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:01.580 
that was only 950
and<00:04:00.599> then<00:04:00.709> the<00:04:00.780> last<00:04:00.950> person<00:04:01.260> I<00:04:01.580> got

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.890 
and then the last person I got

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.209 
and then the last person I got
was<00:04:02.060> just<00:04:02.319> this<00:04:02.439> little<00:04:03.180> smudge<00:04:04.209> or

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:04.310
