it<00:00:12.420> out<00:00:12.570> of<00:00:12.599> the<00:00:12.690> system<00:00:13.340> because<00:00:14.340> otherwise

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
it out of the system because otherwise

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.240 
it out of the system because otherwise
it<00:00:14.910> will<00:00:14.969> catch<00:00:15.150> on<00:00:15.269> fire<00:00:15.949> it<00:00:16.949> doesn't

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
think that the cooling might actually

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.790
