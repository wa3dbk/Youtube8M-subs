be<00:01:50.500> a<00:01:50.530> lot<00:01:50.770> rougher<00:01:51.160> but<00:01:51.490> this<00:01:52.149> is<00:01:52.270> a<00:01:52.300> very

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
be a lot rougher but this is a very

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.560 
be a lot rougher but this is a very
comfortable<00:01:52.990> bike<00:01:53.110> to<00:01:53.259> ride<00:01:53.440> the<00:01:53.979> seat<00:01:54.250> is<00:01:54.570> is

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
comfortable bike to ride the seat is is

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.870 
comfortable bike to ride the seat is is
very<00:01:55.869> soft<00:01:56.229> and<00:01:56.500> it<00:01:57.070> allows<00:01:57.580> for<00:01:57.729> a

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
very soft and it allows for a

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.630 
very soft and it allows for a
comfortable<00:01:58.149> ride<00:01:58.420> and<00:01:58.920> yeah<00:01:59.920> it's<00:02:00.160> not<00:02:00.340> as<00:02:00.490> if

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
comfortable ride and yeah it's not as if

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.980 
comfortable ride and yeah it's not as if
you<00:02:00.789> are<00:02:00.940> leaning<00:02:01.180> too<00:02:01.479> far<00:02:01.720> forward<00:02:02.170> it<00:02:03.130> is<00:02:03.340> uh

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
you are leaning too far forward it is uh

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.840 
you are leaning too far forward it is uh
it's<00:02:04.990> a<00:02:05.140> more<00:02:05.470> upright<00:02:05.770> seated<00:02:06.460> position

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
it's a more upright seated position

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.630 
it's a more upright seated position
certainly<00:02:07.119> not<00:02:07.420> not<00:02:08.259> like<00:02:08.619> the<00:02:08.770> Harley<00:02:09.069> but<00:02:09.220> it

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
certainly not not like the Harley but it

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.840 
certainly not not like the Harley but it
certainly<00:02:09.850> is<00:02:10.060> a<00:02:10.119> cross<00:02:10.360> between<00:02:10.539> a<00:02:11.230> regular

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
certainly is a cross between a regular

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.180 
certainly is a cross between a regular
sport<00:02:12.850> bike<00:02:13.090> and<00:02:13.330> and<00:02:13.959> this<00:02:14.140> in<00:02:14.920> this<00:02:14.980> place

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
sport bike and and this in this place

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.610 
sport bike and and this in this place
how<00:02:15.790> did<00:02:15.850> you<00:02:16.030> like<00:02:16.180> duel<00:02:16.750> disks<00:02:17.140> on<00:02:17.290> a<00:02:17.319> sport

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
how did you like duel disks on a sport

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.430 
how did you like duel disks on a sport
bike<00:02:17.650> this<00:02:18.250> is<00:02:18.310> a<00:02:18.849> very<00:02:19.360> responsive<00:02:19.870> bike<00:02:20.050> you

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
bike this is a very responsive bike you

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.949 
bike this is a very responsive bike you
just<00:02:20.470> touch<00:02:20.800> the<00:02:20.950> brake<00:02:21.160> and<00:02:21.370> and<00:02:21.790> the<00:02:22.090> the

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
just touch the brake and and the the

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.920 
just touch the brake and and the the
braking<00:02:23.290> system<00:02:23.440> is<00:02:23.709> there<00:02:23.890> so<00:02:24.810> how'd<00:02:25.810> you

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
braking system is there so how'd you

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.620 
braking system is there so how'd you
find<00:02:26.170> the<00:02:26.260> handling<00:02:26.800> the<00:02:27.150> handling<00:02:28.150> was

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
find the handling the handling was

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.390 
find the handling the handling was
amazing<00:02:29.110> around<00:02:29.380> particularly<00:02:30.160> around

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
amazing around particularly around

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.610 
amazing around particularly around
corners<00:02:30.790> even<00:02:31.030> at<00:02:31.270> higher<00:02:31.660> speeds<00:02:32.110> around

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
corners even at higher speeds around

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.089 
corners even at higher speeds around
curves<00:02:33.330> incredible<00:02:34.330> handling<00:02:34.980> there<00:02:35.980> was

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
curves incredible handling there was

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.010 
curves incredible handling there was
certainly<00:02:36.459> no<00:02:36.640> no<00:02:37.150> problem<00:02:37.540> with<00:02:37.810> being

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
certainly no no problem with being

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.710 
certainly no no problem with being
worried<00:02:38.500> that<00:02:38.620> the<00:02:38.800> bike<00:02:39.130> may<00:02:39.310> spin<00:02:39.640> out<00:02:39.790> even

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
worried that the bike may spin out even

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.449 
worried that the bike may spin out even
on<00:02:40.810> loose<00:02:41.080> loose<00:02:41.590> gravel<00:02:42.040> or<00:02:42.190> anything<00:02:42.310> like

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
on loose loose gravel or anything like

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.580 
on loose loose gravel or anything like
that<00:02:42.520> I<00:02:43.030> was<00:02:43.510> quite<00:02:43.660> confident<00:02:44.110> and<00:02:44.380> that

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
that I was quite confident and that

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:45.750 
that I was quite confident and that
didn't<00:02:44.800> take<00:02:44.890> long<00:02:44.920> to<00:02:45.250> build<00:02:45.580> that

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
didn't take long to build that

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.460 
didn't take long to build that

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
handling them buddy gives you that sense

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.229 
handling them buddy gives you that sense
that<00:02:51.010> you're<00:02:51.130> gonna<00:02:51.250> go<00:02:51.730> where<00:02:51.910> you<00:02:52.000> look

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
that you're gonna go where you look

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.300 
that you're gonna go where you look
right<00:02:52.510> exactly<00:02:53.170> cornering<00:02:53.590> exactly<00:02:54.099> it

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
right exactly cornering exactly it

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.550 
right exactly cornering exactly it
handles<00:02:54.730> very<00:02:55.000> easily<00:02:55.180> it's<00:02:55.599> not<00:02:56.050> hard<00:02:56.319> to<00:02:56.440> do

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
handles very easily it's not hard to do

you think of the overall layout of the
cockpit<00:03:02.319> the<00:03:02.590> mirrors<00:03:03.069> the<00:03:03.280> controls<00:03:03.730> how<00:03:04.000> did

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
cockpit the mirrors the controls how did

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.479 
cockpit the mirrors the controls how did
that<00:03:04.239> all<00:03:04.300> work<00:03:04.599> for<00:03:04.870> you<00:03:04.959> actually<00:03:05.950> it's<00:03:06.099> the

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
just to see a clock on the bike mm-hmm

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.650 
just to see a clock on the bike mm-hmm
your<00:03:11.980> tachometer<00:03:12.550> is<00:03:12.790> is<00:03:13.120> right<00:03:13.330> in<00:03:13.420> front<00:03:13.480> of

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
your tachometer is is right in front of

your tachometer is is right in front of
your<00:03:13.870> speedometer<00:03:14.350> and<00:03:14.560> to<00:03:15.220> take<00:03:15.370> a<00:03:15.400> quick

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
your speedometer and to take a quick

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.699 
your speedometer and to take a quick
glance<00:03:15.790> down<00:03:16.030> it<00:03:16.239> wasn't<00:03:16.390> hard<00:03:16.660> to<00:03:16.720> to<00:03:17.530> see

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
glance down it wasn't hard to to see

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.170 
glance down it wasn't hard to to see
exactly<00:03:18.010> what<00:03:18.250> speeds<00:03:18.550> you're<00:03:18.760> at<00:03:18.940> and<00:03:19.120> what

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
your rpm was so the mirrors were

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.490 
your rpm was so the mirrors were
replaced<00:03:22.209> at<00:03:22.450> such<00:03:22.720> a<00:03:22.750> position<00:03:22.959> that<00:03:23.319> you<00:03:23.470> can

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
replaced at such a position that you can

the overall layout I took it last night
for<00:03:31.900> a<00:03:31.930> couple<00:03:32.170> of<00:03:32.200> hours<00:03:32.290> and<00:03:32.590> I<00:03:32.680> happen<00:03:33.040> to

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:33.069 
for a couple of hours and I happen to

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:35.490 
for a couple of hours and I happen to
take<00:03:34.060> it<00:03:34.209> through<00:03:34.330> some<00:03:34.630> highly<00:03:34.989> populated

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
take it through some highly populated

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.250 
take it through some highly populated
areas<00:03:35.950> and<00:03:36.330> it<00:03:37.330> certainly<00:03:37.840> turned<00:03:38.049> some<00:03:38.230> heads

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
areas and it certainly turned some heads

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.220 
areas and it certainly turned some heads
it's<00:03:39.220> got<00:03:39.340> some<00:03:39.489> beautiful<00:03:39.700> lines<00:03:40.299> and<00:03:40.720> it's

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
it's got some beautiful lines and it's

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:42.809 
it's got some beautiful lines and it's
very<00:03:41.470> sharp<00:03:41.709> looking<00:03:41.980> I<00:03:42.250> think<00:03:42.430> it's<00:03:42.610> a<00:03:42.640> great

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:42.819 
very sharp looking I think it's a great

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:44.430 
very sharp looking I think it's a great
looking<00:03:43.000> bike<00:03:43.239> it's<00:03:43.930> certainly<00:03:44.230> something

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
looking bike it's certainly something

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.250 
looking bike it's certainly something
that<00:03:44.620> I<00:03:44.739> could<00:03:44.950> warm<00:03:45.459> up<00:03:45.610> to<00:03:45.760> who<00:03:46.660> do<00:03:46.810> you<00:03:46.959> think

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
that I could warm up to who do you think

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.350 
that I could warm up to who do you think
would<00:03:47.380> be<00:03:47.530> the<00:03:47.709> the<00:03:48.310> potential<00:03:48.880> or<00:03:49.060> even

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
would be the the potential or even

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.330 
would be the the potential or even
perfect<00:03:49.810> owner<00:03:50.049> for<00:03:50.380> a<00:03:50.440> katana<00:03:50.860> who<00:03:51.069> would<00:03:51.220> you

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
perfect owner for a katana who would you

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.539 
perfect owner for a katana who would you
recommend<00:03:51.610> this<00:03:51.880> bike<00:03:52.060> to<00:03:52.650> well<00:03:53.650> I<00:03:54.010> think<00:03:54.310> it's

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:54.549 
recommend this bike to well I think it's

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:57.960 
recommend this bike to well I think it's
between<00:03:54.760> a<00:03:55.530> hard-edged<00:03:56.530> sport<00:03:56.980> bike<00:03:57.190> and<00:03:57.519> a

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
between a hard-edged sport bike and a

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.270 
between a hard-edged sport bike and a
cruisin<00:03:58.390> bike<00:03:58.569> so<00:03:58.840> I<00:03:59.110> would<00:03:59.620> certainly<00:03:59.920> say

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
cruisin bike so I would certainly say

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:06.120 
cruisin bike so I would certainly say
that<00:04:00.750> someone<00:04:01.750> in<00:04:01.870> the<00:04:03.030> 3035<00:04:04.030> age<00:04:04.720> range<00:04:05.140> I

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
that someone in the 3035 age range I

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:07.650 
that someone in the 3035 age range I
certainly<00:04:06.850> wouldn't<00:04:07.060> be<00:04:07.120> scared<00:04:07.390> off<00:04:07.510> if

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
certainly wouldn't be scared off if

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.020 
certainly wouldn't be scared off if
you're<00:04:07.810> a<00:04:07.840> new<00:04:07.989> rider<00:04:08.200> but<00:04:09.160> certainly<00:04:09.850> in<00:04:10.000> that

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
you're a new rider but certainly in that

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.259 
you're a new rider but certainly in that
age<00:04:10.269> group<00:04:10.650> it<00:04:11.650> would<00:04:11.739> be<00:04:11.859> a<00:04:11.890> fantastic<00:04:12.269> bike

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
age group it would be a fantastic bike

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:15.300 
age group it would be a fantastic bike
