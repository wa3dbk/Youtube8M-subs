00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.830
 a gameplay on how to make a command 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.629
 home turbo if a command had to 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.339
 it consists basically because it has a 

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:14.039
 xbox joystick and a joystick 

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:16.560
 playstation playstation 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:18.840
 so elevated and here the joystick is 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.500
 deep is good, well, how to make a 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.210
 Home command , it's that easy 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.270
 more defines a man turn bo is that the 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.039
 CeretÃ© button is not valid 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.869
 At the bottom, the script added infinite 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.289
 click click click click click and it's like 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.059
 shoots faster has fast and aims 

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:37.710
 of faster basically everything else more 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.829
 quick thing to do to make a 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.839
 normal control can be turbo as 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.850
 basically this as you can see 

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:48.269
 here I have placed some screws worth 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.829
 Well, you see, you see, you see, I do not think 

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:51.719
 well, the video is well appreciated 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.239
 screws that prevents it from going down 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.460
 ok and avoid that the 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.530
 kiliki click click click and makes the 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.960
 command fired faster point more 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.989
 in that as you all know 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.670
 the command can only point 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.290
 pressing halfway but as 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.380
 nobody is so good from the middle then 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.600
 with this, it's worth it, then also 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.880
 consist of two buttons one here and another 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.759
 here that one serves to create another one for 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.860
 jump like that strix or you're stabbed all 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.020
 faster what I would do is open this 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.240
 command to place this joystick here and more or 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.860
 unless you have an acceptable reason is something 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.659
 so mole will have here that you could not 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.490
 put in no way and I would have you 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.800
 buy a turbo command this is for the 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.570
 who want to go competitive but to 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.130
 public this home is going very well and 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.720
 aim the many hours very fast 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.179
