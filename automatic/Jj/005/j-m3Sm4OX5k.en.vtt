since<00:02:25.040> then<00:02:25.250> but<00:02:25.459> yeah<00:02:26.500> phenomenal<00:02:27.500> artist

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
since then but yeah phenomenal artist

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.630 
since then but yeah phenomenal artist
and<00:02:28.330> songwriter<00:02:29.330> I<00:02:30.370> don't<00:02:31.370> need<00:02:31.459> to<00:02:31.519> talk

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
and songwriter I don't need to talk

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:32.770 
and songwriter I don't need to talk
about<00:02:31.820> Bob<00:02:31.970> Dylan<00:02:32.120> anymore<00:02:32.540> I<00:02:32.570> don't<00:02:32.630> think

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
about Bob Dylan anymore I don't think

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.420 
about Bob Dylan anymore I don't think

Sam<00:02:43.370> we<00:02:43.640> are<00:02:43.670> going<00:02:43.880> to<00:02:43.940> be<00:02:44.000> doing<00:02:44.090> this<00:02:44.239> at<00:02:44.510> the

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
Sam we are going to be doing this at the

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.289 
Sam we are going to be doing this at the
second<00:02:44.959> fret<00:02:45.110> in<00:02:45.500> in<00:02:46.040> E<00:02:46.310> now<00:02:46.760> to<00:02:46.820> get<00:02:47.000> into<00:02:47.209> the

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299 
second fret in in E now to get into the

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:49.449 
second fret in in E now to get into the
drop<00:02:47.510> or<00:02:47.780> the<00:02:47.900> open<00:02:48.140> D<00:02:48.260> tuning<00:02:48.290> we<00:02:49.280> have<00:02:49.370> to

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
drop or the open D tuning we have to

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.250 
drop or the open D tuning we have to
change<00:02:49.670> four<00:02:50.000> strings<00:02:50.360> and<00:02:50.630> that<00:02:50.690> the<00:02:50.900> sixth

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
change four strings and that the sixth

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.560 
change four strings and that the sixth
on<00:02:51.380> the<00:02:51.440> first<00:02:51.680> strings<00:02:51.980> both<00:02:52.280> go<00:02:52.519> down<00:02:52.730> to<00:02:53.299> D

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
on the first strings both go down to D

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.960 
on the first strings both go down to D
down<00:02:54.110> a<00:02:54.200> whole<00:02:54.410> step<00:02:54.530> the<00:02:55.220> second<00:02:55.610> string<00:02:55.790> goes

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
down a whole step the second string goes

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.910 
down a whole step the second string goes
down<00:02:56.120> a<00:02:56.150> whole<00:02:56.360> step<00:02:56.570> to<00:02:56.630> a<00:02:56.780> and<00:02:57.350> the<00:02:57.709> third

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
down a whole step to a and the third

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.430 
down a whole step to a and the third
string<00:02:58.130> goes<00:02:58.310> down<00:02:58.459> a<00:02:58.489> half<00:02:58.790> step<00:02:58.970> to<00:02:59.120> F<00:02:59.390> sharp

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
string goes down a half step to F sharp

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.710 
string goes down a half step to F sharp
so<00:03:00.440> in<00:03:00.769> D<00:03:01.070> we<00:03:01.370> would<00:03:01.459> have<00:03:01.670> da<00:03:02.000> D<00:03:02.690> F<00:03:03.019> sharp<00:03:03.079> a<00:03:03.709> D

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
so in D we would have da D F sharp a D

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.120 
so in D we would have da D F sharp a D
when<00:03:05.720> we<00:03:05.840> keep<00:03:06.019> on<00:03:06.170> up<00:03:06.320> to<00:03:06.410> the<00:03:06.470> second<00:03:06.829> fret<00:03:06.980> we

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
when we keep on up to the second fret we

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:08.650 
when we keep on up to the second fret we
have<00:03:07.280> the<00:03:07.370> equivalent<00:03:07.670> in<00:03:08.060> E<00:03:08.299> now<00:03:08.540> an

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
have the equivalent in E now an

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.000 
have the equivalent in E now an
important<00:03:09.049> thing<00:03:09.110> one<00:03:09.650> of<00:03:09.680> the<00:03:09.739> things<00:03:09.829> that

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
important thing one of the things that

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.069 
important thing one of the things that
kind<00:03:10.160> of<00:03:10.220> distinguishes<00:03:10.790> the<00:03:11.030> two<00:03:11.060> main<00:03:11.660> open

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:12.079 
kind of distinguishes the two main open

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:13.960 
kind of distinguishes the two main open
tunings<00:03:12.470> the<00:03:12.590> two<00:03:12.709> most<00:03:12.860> common<00:03:13.310> which<00:03:13.850> I

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
tunings the two most common which I

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.520 
tunings the two most common which I
would<00:03:14.090> consider<00:03:14.299> the<00:03:14.480> D<00:03:14.600> tuning<00:03:14.810> and<00:03:15.140> the<00:03:15.230> G

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
would consider the D tuning and the G

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.060 
would consider the D tuning and the G
tuning<00:03:15.920> is<00:03:16.299> the<00:03:17.299> arrangements<00:03:17.989> of<00:03:18.110> the<00:03:18.230> three

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
tuning is the arrangements of the three

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:20.560 
tuning is the arrangements of the three
notes<00:03:19.250> that<00:03:19.400> make<00:03:19.549> up<00:03:19.670> the<00:03:19.790> chord<00:03:20.060> one<00:03:20.540> three

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570

notes that make up the chord one three
and<00:03:20.959> five<00:03:21.230> and<00:03:21.500> in<00:03:21.920> a<00:03:21.950> D<00:03:22.220> tuning

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
and five and in a D tuning

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.710 
and five and in a D tuning
we<00:03:23.060> have<00:03:23.209> the<00:03:23.330> lowest<00:03:23.540> string<00:03:23.959> tune

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
we have the lowest string tune

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.220 
we have the lowest string tune
the<00:03:24.930> root<00:03:25.140> of<00:03:25.350> cord<00:03:25.800> one<00:03:26.100> and<00:03:26.820> then<00:03:27.180> beef<00:03:27.780> the

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
the root of cord one and then beef the

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.900 
the root of cord one and then beef the

five as opposed to an ax G two and then
the<00:03:32.640> third<00:03:32.670> will<00:03:33.090> have<00:03:33.300> one<00:03:33.450> third<00:03:33.690> in<00:03:33.840> there

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:33.960 
the third will have one third in there

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.720 
the third will have one third in there
and<00:03:34.080> that's<00:03:34.140> on<00:03:34.320> the<00:03:34.440> third<00:03:34.470> string<00:03:35.190> otherwise

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.640 
and that's on the third string otherwise
we<00:03:36.060> have<00:03:36.300> roots<00:03:36.540> and<00:03:36.750> fifths<00:03:36.900> now<00:03:37.200> in<00:03:37.320> a<00:03:37.410> G

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.470 
we have roots and fifths now in a G
tuning<00:03:37.920> we<00:03:38.700> have<00:03:38.880> it<00:03:39.000> laid<00:03:39.150> out<00:03:39.180> a<00:03:39.330> little

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
tuning we have it laid out a little

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.940 
tuning we have it laid out a little
differently<00:03:39.840> the<00:03:40.020> only<00:03:40.260> third<00:03:40.530> and<00:03:40.740> the<00:03:40.800> G

tuning<00:03:41.310> is<00:03:41.430> on<00:03:41.550> the<00:03:41.670> second<00:03:42.090> string<00:03:42.390> and<00:03:42.600> then

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
tuning is on the second string and then

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.170 
tuning is on the second string and then
we<00:03:43.350> have<00:03:43.530> the<00:03:43.710> root<00:03:43.890> of<00:03:44.100> chord<00:03:44.490> one<00:03:44.730> on<00:03:45.000> the

we have the root of chord one on the
fifth<00:03:45.390> string<00:03:45.540> the<00:03:45.720> G<00:03:46.110> and<00:03:46.520> the<00:03:47.520> root<00:03:47.700> of<00:03:47.910> chord

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
five on the sixth string which would be

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.950 
five on the sixth string which would be
a<00:03:51.420> D<00:03:51.660> so<00:03:52.820> they're<00:03:53.820> similar<00:03:54.360> in<00:03:54.480> a<00:03:54.810> lot<00:03:54.840> of

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
licks but this is a song that could be

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.040 
licks but this is a song that could be
could<00:04:51.120> go<00:04:51.210> lots<00:04:51.480> of<00:04:51.600> different<00:04:51.900> ways<00:04:52.020> you

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
could go lots of different ways you

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.780 
could go lots of different ways you
don't<00:04:52.290> have<00:04:52.500> to<00:04:52.620> play<00:04:52.800> it<00:04:52.890> exactly<00:04:53.010> but<00:04:53.520> you<00:04:53.669> do

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790

don't have to play it exactly but you do
want<00:04:54.030> to<00:04:54.060> get<00:04:54.570> the<00:04:54.810> chord<00:04:55.050> changes<00:04:55.230> in<00:04:55.530> there

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
want to get the chord changes in there

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.780 
play with bars and the last thing I play
this

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:06.790 

really<00:05:05.690> incorporated<00:05:06.230> what<00:05:06.320> was<00:05:06.410> going<00:05:06.590> on<00:05:06.680> in

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
really incorporated what was going on in

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.470 
really incorporated what was going on in
the<00:05:06.890> base<00:05:07.100> and<00:05:07.430> Bob<00:05:07.580> didn't<00:05:08.030> really<00:05:08.270> play<00:05:08.450> that

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:08.480 
the base and Bob didn't really play that

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.240 
the base and Bob didn't really play that
on<00:05:08.840> the<00:05:08.960> guitar<00:05:09.260> so<00:05:09.470> that<00:05:09.590> part<00:05:09.830> is<00:05:09.920> kind<00:05:10.130> of<00:05:10.160> a

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
on the guitar so that part is kind of a

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.670 
on the guitar so that part is kind of a
hybrid<00:05:10.600> part<00:05:11.600> to<00:05:11.810> incorporate<00:05:12.350> the

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 
hybrid part to incorporate the

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.110 
hybrid part to incorporate the
descending<00:05:13.100> bass<00:05:13.280> line<00:05:13.550> along<00:05:13.880> with<00:05:14.030> the

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
descending bass line along with the

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.700 
descending bass line along with the
descending<00:05:14.540> melody<00:05:14.870> notes<00:05:15.080> are<00:05:15.230> happening<00:05:15.590> in

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710 
descending melody notes are happening in

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.380 
descending melody notes are happening in
the<00:05:15.800> courts<00:05:16.100> so<00:05:16.580> we'll<00:05:17.000> talk<00:05:17.120> about<00:05:17.180> that

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:17.390 
the courts so we'll talk about that

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:19.060 
the courts so we'll talk about that
later<00:05:18.320> too<00:05:18.530> okay

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.070 
later too okay
