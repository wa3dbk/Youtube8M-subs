indirectly it could because if you push

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.770 
indirectly it could because if you push

demonstration<00:02:44.360> to<00:02:44.540> show<00:02:44.690> how<00:02:45.079> harp<00:02:45.500> could

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
demonstration to show how harp could

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.960 
demonstration to show how harp could
manipulate<00:02:46.250> the<00:02:46.790> atmosphere<00:02:48.459> so<00:02:49.459> what<00:02:49.820> we've

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
manipulate the atmosphere so what we've

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.850 
manipulate the atmosphere so what we've
done<00:02:50.120> is<00:02:50.299> we've<00:02:50.450> got<00:02:50.480> a<00:02:50.840> cloud<00:02:51.110> generator<00:02:51.410> up

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
done is we've got a cloud generator up

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.710 
done is we've got a cloud generator up
here<00:02:52.070> it's<00:02:52.190> an<00:02:52.310> ultrasonic<00:02:52.730> nebulizer<00:02:52.910> it's

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
here it's an ultrasonic nebulizer it's

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.780 
here it's an ultrasonic nebulizer it's
going<00:02:53.840> to<00:02:53.900> create<00:02:54.140> real<00:02:54.829> water<00:02:55.280> particles

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
going to create real water particles

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.450 
going to create real water particles
just<00:02:56.180> like<00:02:56.329> you<00:02:56.480> would<00:02:56.570> find<00:02:56.840> in<00:02:56.959> a<00:02:57.019> cloud

00:02:59.450 --> 00:02:59.460 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.280 

what<00:03:00.210> we're<00:03:00.360> seeing<00:03:00.510> now<00:03:00.660> is<00:03:00.990> we're<00:03:01.170> actually

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
what we're seeing now is we're actually

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.830 
what we're seeing now is we're actually
filling<00:03:01.740> this<00:03:01.980> chamber<00:03:02.430> with<00:03:02.840> microscopic

filling this chamber with microscopic
water<00:03:04.320> particles<00:03:04.830> you<00:03:04.980> can<00:03:05.130> see<00:03:05.400> that<00:03:06.000> it's

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
water particles you can see that it's

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.700 
water particles you can see that it's
almost<00:03:06.390> completely<00:03:07.050> filled<00:03:07.290> with<00:03:07.500> water

how harp works what we've done is we've

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.649 
how harp works what we've done is we've
