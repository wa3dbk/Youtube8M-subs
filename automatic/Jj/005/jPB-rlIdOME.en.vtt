there's a little hole and I've started
filling<00:00:06.420> this<00:00:06.660> with<00:00:06.720> fiberfill<00:00:07.440> so<00:00:07.680> that<00:00:07.830> you

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
the fiberfill in the couple tricks is

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.179 
the fiberfill in the couple tricks is
one<00:00:16.760> to<00:00:17.760> know<00:00:17.940> that<00:00:18.390> when<00:00:18.690> you<00:00:18.810> start<00:00:19.140> off<00:00:19.320> you

one to know that when you start off you

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.429 
one to know that when you start off you
want<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.670> take<00:00:21.270> your<00:00:21.420> fiberfill<00:00:21.960> which<00:00:22.140> is<00:00:22.289> all

wadded up usually impact kind of tight

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.470 
wadded up usually impact kind of tight
and<00:00:24.510> just<00:00:25.500> keep<00:00:25.800> separating<00:00:26.460> it<00:00:26.609> out<00:00:26.760> into

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
and just keep separating it out into

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.990 
and just keep separating it out into
small<00:00:27.930> little<00:00:28.320> bits<00:00:28.609> you<00:00:29.609> have<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:29.849> do<00:00:29.970> a

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
need to know is that these holes can be

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.680 
need to know is that these holes can be
anywhere<00:00:35.070> from<00:00:35.130> a<00:00:35.520> half<00:00:35.880> an<00:00:36.030> inch<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.329> an<00:00:36.510> inch

knitted and whether they needed to gauge
or<00:00:39.899> not<00:00:40.079> we're<00:00:40.800> expecting<00:00:41.399> that<00:00:41.430> it's<00:00:41.640> going

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
or not we're expecting that it's going

or not we're expecting that it's going
to<00:00:41.969> be<00:00:42.059> about<00:00:42.540> three<00:00:42.840> quarters<00:00:43.140> of<00:00:43.170> an<00:00:43.379> inch<00:00:43.500> if

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
to be about three quarters of an inch if

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.819 
to be about three quarters of an inch if
you're<00:00:44.010> knitting<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.430> gauge<00:00:44.640> I<00:00:45.320> just<00:00:46.320> take<00:00:46.590> and

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
you're knitting to gauge I just take and

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.010 
you're knitting to gauge I just take and
slowly<00:00:47.640> poke<00:00:48.059> it<00:00:48.239> in<00:00:48.390> with<00:00:49.200> my<00:00:49.379> fingers<00:00:51.020> I'm

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020

gonna<00:00:52.170> get<00:00:52.440> some<00:00:52.680> more<00:00:52.829> some<00:00:53.670> other<00:00:53.879> ways<00:00:54.059> I've

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
gonna get some more some other ways I've

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.119 
gonna get some more some other ways I've
seen<00:00:54.510> people<00:00:54.809> do<00:00:54.989> is<00:00:55.140> use<00:00:55.320> chopsticks

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
to help poke it in you could use the

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:09.600 
to help poke it in you could use the
point<00:01:00.300> of<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.510> pencil<00:01:01.039> and<00:01:02.180> work<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.329> in

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.499 

you<00:01:10.610> can<00:01:10.790> even<00:01:10.939> use<00:01:12.280> the<00:01:13.280> blunt<00:01:13.579> end<00:01:13.880> of<00:01:14.180> a

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 
you can even use the blunt end of a

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:22.880 
you can even use the blunt end of a
crochet<00:01:14.869> hook

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.370 

for<00:01:23.520> me<00:01:23.670> I<00:01:23.970> find<00:01:24.720> my<00:01:24.960> finger<00:01:25.290> works<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.710> best

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
for me I find my finger works the best

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.630 
for me I find my finger works the best
after<00:01:28.380> you<00:01:28.470> get<00:01:28.650> your<00:01:28.800> knocker<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.220> little<00:01:29.490> bit

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
after you get your knocker a little bit

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.270 
after you get your knocker a little bit
full<00:01:29.940> and<00:01:30.240> this<00:01:30.720> is<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.050> back<00:01:31.260> side<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.920> this

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
fingers in and kind of move this

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:45.140 
fingers in and kind of move this
stuffing<00:01:37.410> forward<00:01:41.240> and<00:01:43.580> then<00:01:44.580> putting<00:01:45.030> your

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 
stuffing forward and then putting your

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.540 
stuffing forward and then putting your
hands<00:01:45.570> underneath<00:01:45.990> like<00:01:46.500> this<00:01:46.560> kind<00:01:47.460> of

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:47.550 
hands underneath like this kind of

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.840 
hands underneath like this kind of
pillow<00:01:47.790> in<00:01:48.030> it<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:49.200> can<00:01:49.440> manipulate<00:01:50.190> and<00:01:50.700> move

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
pillow in it you can manipulate and move

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.960 
pillow in it you can manipulate and move
it<00:01:51.000> around<00:01:52.250> until<00:01:53.250> you<00:01:53.340> get<00:01:53.490> kind<00:01:53.790> of<00:01:53.850> the

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
it around until you get kind of the

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.710 
it around until you get kind of the
shape<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:54.390> want<00:01:56.030> now<00:01:57.030> some<00:01:57.360> people<00:01:57.540> prefer

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
shape you want now some people prefer

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.719 
shape you want now some people prefer
them<00:01:58.170> flatter<00:01:58.470> so<00:01:58.979> then<00:01:59.190> you<00:01:59.280> use<00:01:59.490> less

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
them flatter so then you use less

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.760 
them flatter so then you use less
stuffing<00:02:00.180> some<00:02:00.450> people<00:02:00.750> prefer<00:02:00.960> them<00:02:01.290> perkier

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
stuffing some people prefer them perkier

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.820 
stuffing some people prefer them perkier
then<00:02:02.340> you<00:02:02.490> would<00:02:02.640> use<00:02:02.790> more<00:02:03.030> stuffy<00:02:03.830> they're

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
then you would use more stuffy they're

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.920 
then you would use more stuffy they're
flexible<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.729> stitches<00:02:06.150> are<00:02:06.330> flexible<00:02:06.750> so

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
flexible the stitches are flexible so

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.229 
flexible the stitches are flexible so
it's<00:02:07.320> easy<00:02:07.500> to<00:02:07.649> stretch<00:02:08.550> them<00:02:08.790> a<00:02:08.820> little<00:02:09.119> bit

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
it's easy to stretch them a little bit

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.999 
it's easy to stretch them a little bit
make<00:02:09.479> them<00:02:09.630> a<00:02:09.690> little<00:02:09.780> bigger<00:02:10.050> or<00:02:10.410> make<00:02:10.830> them<00:02:10.979> a

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
make them a little bigger or make them a

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.400 
make them a little bigger or make them a
little<00:02:11.160> smaller<00:02:11.600> it's<00:02:12.600> your<00:02:12.810> choice

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
little smaller it's your choice

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.160 
little smaller it's your choice
for<00:02:14.100> washing<00:02:14.610> I<00:02:14.790> think<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.360> fiberfill<00:02:15.750> can<00:02:16.080> be

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
for washing I think the fiberfill can be

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.199 
for washing I think the fiberfill can be
removed<00:02:16.590> and<00:02:16.890> replaced<00:02:17.010> if<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:17.730> fiberfill

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
removed and replaced if the fiberfill

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.240 
removed and replaced if the fiberfill
gets<00:02:18.420> old<00:02:18.720> or<00:02:18.959> matted<00:02:19.350> up<00:02:19.500> which<00:02:19.830> sometimes

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
gets old or matted up which sometimes

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.190 
gets old or matted up which sometimes
fiberfill<00:02:20.760> after<00:02:21.060> a<00:02:21.090> while<00:02:21.360> will<00:02:21.600> get<00:02:21.810> kind<00:02:22.110> of

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
fiberfill after a while will get kind of

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.760 
fiberfill after a while will get kind of
lumpy<00:02:22.950> bumpy<00:02:23.750> then<00:02:24.750> what<00:02:24.930> you<00:02:25.020> can<00:02:25.200> do<00:02:25.410> is<00:02:25.650> you
