this year and I become very close with a

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.799 
this year and I become very close with a
lot<00:00:09.150> of<00:00:09.330> his<00:00:09.960> students<00:00:10.469> so<00:00:11.280> I<00:00:11.670> knew<00:00:12.120> that<00:00:12.630> when

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
lot of his students so I knew that when

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.900 
lot of his students so I knew that when
we<00:00:12.929> were<00:00:13.049> developing<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.740> concept<00:00:13.980> that<00:00:14.370> it

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
we were developing the concept that it

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.630 
we were developing the concept that it
had<00:00:15.630> to<00:00:15.839> include<00:00:16.139> students<00:00:17.130> from<00:00:17.430> Mike's

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640

had to include students from Mike's
lessons<00:00:18.000> calm<00:00:18.449> so<00:00:19.020> knowing<00:00:19.350> that<00:00:19.500> we<00:00:19.619> wanted

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
lessons calm so knowing that we wanted

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.790 
lessons calm so knowing that we wanted
to<00:00:19.980> include<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.520> students<00:00:20.910> in<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.119> ad<00:00:21.270> and

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:21.800 
to include the students in the ad and

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.290 
to include the students in the ad and
also<00:00:22.800> knowing<00:00:23.039> that<00:00:23.369> Mike<00:00:23.550> has<00:00:23.730> students<00:00:24.150> all

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
also knowing that Mike has students all

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.900 
also knowing that Mike has students all
over<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.810> world<00:00:25.019> and<00:00:25.439> having<00:00:25.980> them<00:00:26.189> all<00:00:26.400> local

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
over the world and having them all local

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.570 
over the world and having them all local
wouldn't<00:00:27.330> be<00:00:27.449> possible<00:00:27.720> for<00:00:28.320> one<00:00:28.470> shot<00:00:28.800> we

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
wouldn't be possible for one shot we

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.009 
wouldn't be possible for one shot we
took<00:00:29.760> it<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.029> next<00:00:30.150> level<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:30.779> thought

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
took it to the next level and thought

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.680 
took it to the next level and thought
what<00:00:31.500> if<00:00:31.619> we<00:00:31.769> did<00:00:31.980> a<00:00:32.189> gallery<00:00:32.759> of<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.329> group<00:00:33.600> of

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
what if we did a gallery of a group of

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.900 
what if we did a gallery of a group of
students<00:00:34.170> so<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.250> first<00:00:35.430> thing<00:00:35.460> we<00:00:35.610> had<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.760> do

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
students so the first thing we had to do

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.940 
students so the first thing we had to do
is<00:00:36.149> figure<00:00:36.570> out<00:00:36.690> how<00:00:37.140> many<00:00:37.320> students<00:00:37.680> can<00:00:37.739> we

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
is figure out how many students can we

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.410 
is figure out how many students can we
fit<00:00:38.219> in<00:00:38.399> this<00:00:38.520> out<00:00:38.700> I<00:00:38.730> want<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.000> get<00:00:39.090> as<00:00:39.180> many<00:00:39.300> as

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
fit in this out I want to get as many as

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.060 
fit in this out I want to get as many as
possible<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:40.379> do<00:00:40.500> that<00:00:40.620> we<00:00:40.680> had<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:40.800> find<00:00:41.010> a

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
possible to do that we had to find a

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.500 
possible to do that we had to find a
location<00:00:41.340> so<00:00:41.820> we<00:00:41.910> went<00:00:42.030> scouting<00:00:42.300> locations

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
location so we went scouting locations

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.660 
location so we went scouting locations
in<00:00:42.960> Old<00:00:43.110> Town<00:00:43.170> Folsom<00:00:43.649> found<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.340> parking

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
in Old Town Folsom found the parking

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.060 
in Old Town Folsom found the parking
garage<00:00:45.079> and<00:00:46.079> it<00:00:46.200> had<00:00:46.289> this<00:00:46.440> wall<00:00:46.710> that<00:00:46.920> just

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
garage and it had this wall that just

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.440 
garage and it had this wall that just
seemed<00:00:47.219> perfect<00:00:47.670> for<00:00:47.730> it<00:00:47.940> so<00:00:48.059> we<00:00:48.180> kind<00:00:48.390> of

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
seemed perfect for it so we kind of

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.910 
seemed perfect for it so we kind of
measured<00:00:48.840> it<00:00:48.960> all<00:00:49.079> out<00:00:49.260> mapped<00:00:49.590> it<00:00:49.710> all<00:00:49.770> out

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
measured it all out mapped it all out

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.040 
measured it all out mapped it all out
and<00:00:50.370> we<00:00:50.460> knew<00:00:50.550> that<00:00:50.579> we<00:00:50.730> could<00:00:50.879> fit<00:00:51.059> about<00:00:51.149> 75

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
and we knew that we could fit about 75

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.069 
and we knew that we could fit about 75
to<00:00:52.379> 80<00:00:52.559> students<00:00:53.070> so<00:00:53.789> then<00:00:54.180> we<00:00:54.270> had<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.449> go<00:00:54.690> kind

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
to 80 students so then we had to go kind

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.990 
to 80 students so then we had to go kind
of<00:00:55.140> contact<00:00:55.710> students<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.579> we<00:00:56.640> started<00:00:56.879> with

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
of contact students and we started with

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.750 
of contact students and we started with
our<00:00:57.030> campers<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.780> then<00:00:58.350> kind<00:00:59.070> of<00:00:59.219> brought

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
our campers and then kind of brought

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:00.920
