00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:23.370
 We are going to present a procedure for 

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:25.850
 can print from my samsung galaxy 

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:30.900
 to a printer 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:33.270
 in this case it is a multifunction brother 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.460
 this multifunction has an ip address 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.610
 that has a network card whereby 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:42.610
 I will try to configure the wifi to 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:45.680
 can print wirelessly 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:49.010
 The first thing we have to do is connect 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.850
 the printer via wifi through the in 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.519
 this case in front 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.530
 today also to connect my wifi 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:01:00.920
 Samsung galaxy wifi device 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.920
 activate wifi 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.000
 I check that it connects to the network 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.300
 home 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.550
 what I have configured the printer 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:15.190
 let's see how it gets the ip address and 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:17.530
 connected there we have 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.870
 the icon that is configured and 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:24.070
 connected to the wifi network 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:27.700
 and the cat often we must look 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.700
 applications marquez 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.050
 the application called 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:44.620
 and it is that we have it there 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:47.730
 but without rest to be able to use it 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.730
 with my person brother 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.780
 Thus 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:59.890
 once I have it installed 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:04.409
 I'm going to go to that application 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.409
 there we have it and I stick it in it 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.970
 once we have opened the application 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:12.580
 one of the options is to print I'm going to 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.220
 write photos 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.590
 in this case I'm going to print a photo 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.140
 previously scanned 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.020
 I look in it 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.260
 Whoever I want, I'm going to take it and give it 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:28.439
 print option 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:32.090
 automatically pass the data via 

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:32.090
 wifi to my printer 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.950
 and in turn it will be printed 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:32.150
 we can check how the graph has been 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.150
 printed 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.780
 ah
