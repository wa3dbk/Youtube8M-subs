00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
each side of the head it's a simple

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.260 
each side of the head it's a simple
three<00:01:28.810> strand<00:01:29.200> braid<00:01:29.410> it<00:01:29.860> is<00:01:30.010> not<00:01:30.400> perfect<00:01:31.030> I

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
three strand braid it is not perfect I

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.330 
three strand braid it is not perfect I
pull<00:01:31.510> random<00:01:31.960> pieces<00:01:32.200> from<00:01:32.560> all<00:01:32.710> over<00:01:32.740> to<00:01:33.160> put

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
pull random pieces from all over to put

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.160 
pull random pieces from all over to put
into<00:01:33.490> the<00:01:33.730> braid<00:01:33.940> both<00:01:34.360> sides<00:01:34.690> and<00:01:35.080> they

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
into the braid both sides and they

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.500 
into the braid both sides and they
should<00:01:35.440> end<00:01:35.770> back<00:01:36.370> where<00:01:36.730> that<00:01:36.910> bun<00:01:37.120> is<00:01:37.300> going

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:37.510 
should end back where that bun is going

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.570 
should end back where that bun is going
to<00:01:37.570> be<00:01:37.690> located<00:01:38.020> so<00:01:38.440> step<00:01:38.740> four<00:01:39.010> is<00:01:39.250> kind<00:01:39.520> of

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
to be located so step four is kind of

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:40.890 
to be located so step four is kind of
where<00:01:39.700> all<00:01:39.730> the<00:01:40.030> magic<00:01:40.210> starts<00:01:40.750> to<00:01:40.810> happen

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 
where all the magic starts to happen

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.080 
where all the magic starts to happen
we're<00:01:41.380> gonna<00:01:41.440> take<00:01:41.770> an<00:01:41.920> elastic<00:01:42.190> and<00:01:42.730> we're

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090
