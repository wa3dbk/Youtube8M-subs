 it's a small knife 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:35.280
 but in front of the music is rather 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:37.260

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.559
 of artists who are there I stuck johann 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.559
 sg everything and we felt to do the project 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.670
 it's an album that I make a duet with 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.670
 stéphane case you who are an artist 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.260
 Senegalese report awesome artist and 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.640
 so we try to mix the genres 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:19.119
 in the album that's ok, we can say an album 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.350
 multicultural with several types of 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:22.180
 different songs 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.600
 on my side it's going to be mostly 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:28.409
 sum and we will try to me it's 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.409
 mix with 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.090
 managers are exchanged it's not 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.810
 sustainable basis 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.810
 it's his studio 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:45.770
 privacy even 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.539
 so in fact it's come 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.450
 it came from a retirement meeting 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:52.280
 that was fine we met so at 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.049
 early it was just a delirium and after 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.659
 this delay she could not arrive at 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:58.369
 the talk album we invent a mix of 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:01.850
 genres that did to me what he was doing to 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:03.229
 home at home I told him my 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.209
 songs change 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.299
 after we know without there being no 

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:09.979
 to be carried out and we had said that we could not 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:11.810
 hives are capable of Capri 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.069
 relief was activating the album landes 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.670

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.360
 up we try we'll try to do the 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.959
 mixing these different types of 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:27.590
 music and having a color we're going 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:30.920
 say an album that is theirs the general 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.870
 is basically the same on all 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.510

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.340
