this is really a great unit to start

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:54.610 
this is really a great unit to start
with<00:00:51.920> it's<00:00:52.550> not<00:00:52.970> one<00:00:53.360> that<00:00:53.989> you're<00:00:54.170> going<00:00:54.500> to

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
with it's not one that you're going to

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.100 
with it's not one that you're going to
want<00:00:54.800> to<00:00:54.980> use<00:00:55.190> as<00:00:55.430> your<00:00:55.549> primary<00:00:55.850> unit<00:00:56.479> for<00:00:57.080> a

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:00.229 
long time and one of the main reasons

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:03.579 
long time and one of the main reasons
why<00:01:00.379> is<00:01:00.710> that<00:01:01.309> it<00:01:01.640> is<00:01:01.729> a<00:01:01.760> VHF<00:01:02.659> system<00:01:03.199> and<00:01:03.440> not<00:01:03.530> a

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
why is that it is a VHF system and not a

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:06.039 
why is that it is a VHF system and not a
UHS<00:01:04.129> system<00:01:04.549> that<00:01:04.940> being<00:01:05.180> said<00:01:05.449> it<00:01:05.659> only<00:01:05.810> has

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:06.049 
UHS system that being said it only has

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:09.399 
UHS system that being said it only has
two<00:01:06.770> channels<00:01:06.979> to<00:01:07.280> work<00:01:07.400> on<00:01:07.780> frequency<00:01:08.780> a<00:01:08.960> and

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
two channels to work on frequency a and

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:11.890 
two channels to work on frequency a and
B<00:01:09.650> and<00:01:09.939> which<00:01:10.939> is<00:01:11.060> nice<00:01:11.210> that<00:01:11.390> you<00:01:11.510> have<00:01:11.659> at

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
B and which is nice that you have at

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.480 
B and which is nice that you have at
least<00:01:12.110> that<00:01:12.380> much<00:01:12.530> versatility<00:01:12.979> because<00:01:13.220> of

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
least that much versatility because of

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.039 
least that much versatility because of
the<00:01:13.549> price<00:01:13.790> point<00:01:14.060> you<00:01:14.330> really<00:01:14.540> can't<00:01:14.750> beat<00:01:15.020> it

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049 
the price point you really can't beat it

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:17.170 
the price point you really can't beat it
now<00:01:15.770> it<00:01:16.070> claims<00:01:16.369> it<00:01:16.520> as<00:01:16.580> an<00:01:16.700> effective<00:01:17.030> range

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
now it claims it as an effective range

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.670 
now it claims it as an effective range
of<00:01:17.360> a<00:01:17.450> hundred<00:01:17.720> feet<00:01:17.750> and<00:01:18.140> under<00:01:18.409> ideal
