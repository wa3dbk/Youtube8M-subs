00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
2013 which I as I predicted it would be

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.280 
2013 which I as I predicted it would be
well<00:00:40.020> I<00:00:40.050> just<00:00:40.260> guessed<00:00:40.680> really<00:00:42.079> wasn't<00:00:43.079> really

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
well I just guessed really wasn't really

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.810 
well I just guessed really wasn't really
a<00:00:43.320> prediction<00:00:43.649> which<00:00:44.160> is<00:00:44.309> good<00:00:44.550> although

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
a prediction which is good although

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.840 
a prediction which is good although
there's<00:00:45.149> no<00:00:45.300> mention<00:00:45.539> of<00:00:45.809> hath<00:00:46.020> fire<00:00:46.320> or

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:46.850 
there's no mention of hath fire or

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.549 
there's no mention of hath fire or
Dawnguard<00:00:47.850> which<00:00:48.480> is<00:00:48.719> something<00:00:48.899> that<00:00:49.110> I<00:00:49.200> have

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
Dawnguard which is something that I have

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.650 
Dawnguard which is something that I have
suspected<00:00:50.460> that<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.850> properties<00:00:51.329> would<00:00:51.449> have

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
suspected that the properties would have

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.260 
suspected that the properties would have
sorted<00:00:52.320> before<00:00:52.800> they<00:00:53.280> got<00:00:53.399> Dragonborn<00:00:54.000> but

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
sorted before they got Dragonborn but

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.240 
sorted before they got Dragonborn but
what<00:00:54.719> am<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:54.899> trying<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.170> say<00:00:55.410> that<00:00:55.980> there

what am I trying to say that there

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.279 
what am I trying to say that there
aren't<00:00:56.430> issues<00:00:56.969> with<00:00:57.180> Dragonborn<00:00:57.840> that<00:00:58.079> there

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
aren't issues with Dragonborn that there

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.069 
aren't issues with Dragonborn that there
are<00:00:58.469> with<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.859> dawnguard<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.940> half<00:01:00.750> fire
