like<00:00:42.149> this<00:00:48.140> we<00:00:49.140> do<00:00:49.289> this<00:00:49.469> so<00:00:49.770> that<00:00:49.800> we<00:00:49.920> can

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
like this we do this so that we can

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.529 
like this we do this so that we can
match<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.280> note<00:00:50.670> length<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.059> articulation

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539

hear<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.739> five<00:00:59.100> stroke<00:00:59.370> roll<00:00:59.840> that<00:01:00.840> would<00:01:00.930> sound

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
hear a five stroke roll that would sound

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:09.140 
hear a five stroke roll that would sound
like<00:01:01.170> this<00:01:04.489> as<00:01:06.500> you<00:01:07.500> can<00:01:07.680> hear<00:01:08.040> there's<00:01:08.909> an

the release note another common way

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.300 
the release note another common way
you'll<00:01:41.610> see<00:01:41.790> this<00:01:41.939> is<00:01:42.180> several<00:01:43.140> untied<00:01:43.979> rolls

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
you'll see this is several untied rolls

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.060 
you'll see this is several untied rolls
in<00:01:44.640> succession<00:01:45.119> in<00:01:45.420> this<00:01:46.259> example<00:01:46.619> there's

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
in succession in this example there's

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.389 
in succession in this example there's
going<00:01:47.189> to<00:01:47.250> be<00:01:47.310> four<00:01:47.729> quarter<00:01:48.630> note<00:01:48.780> rolls<00:01:49.020> and

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
going to be four quarter note rolls and

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:52.550 
going to be four quarter note rolls and
two<00:01:50.399> half<00:01:50.790> note<00:01:51.060> rolls<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:51.600> all<00:01:51.990> of<00:01:52.110> them<00:01:52.290> will

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
two half note rolls and all of them will

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.639 
two half note rolls and all of them will
be<00:01:52.680> untied<00:01:53.280> rolls<00:01:53.729> so<00:01:54.570> in<00:01:54.869> each<00:01:55.170> case<00:01:55.200> you're

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
be untied rolls so in each case you're

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.590 
be untied rolls so in each case you're
simply<00:01:55.890> going<00:01:56.009> to<00:01:56.070> take<00:01:56.310> out<00:01:56.520> one<00:01:57.180> multiple

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
simply going to take out one multiple

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.389 
simply going to take out one multiple
bounce<00:01:57.780> roll<00:01:58.079> so<00:01:58.409> that<00:01:58.439> each<00:01:58.770> of<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.979> rolls<00:01:59.189> is

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
bounce roll so that each of the rolls is

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:05.900 
bounce roll so that each of the rolls is
separated

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.400 

so<00:02:06.910> when<00:02:07.030> playing<00:02:07.240> untied<00:02:07.750> rolls<00:02:08.020> just

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
so when playing untied rolls just

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.590 
so when playing untied rolls just
remember<00:02:08.890> that<00:02:09.130> the<00:02:09.280> goal<00:02:09.550> is<00:02:09.850> to<00:02:10.060> use<00:02:10.240> your

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
remember that the goal is to use your

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.780 
remember that the goal is to use your
ear<00:02:10.869> and<00:02:11.080> match<00:02:11.590> note<00:02:11.950> links<00:02:12.250> with<00:02:12.520> the<00:02:12.640> other

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
ear and match note links with the other

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.070 
ear and match note links with the other
instruments<00:02:13.780> in<00:02:13.930> the<00:02:14.020> band<00:02:14.230> or<00:02:14.470> the<00:02:14.650> orchestra
