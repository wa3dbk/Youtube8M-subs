00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.280 

up<00:01:08.880> at<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.060> top<00:01:09.330> here<00:01:09.360> it's<00:01:09.840> missing

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
up at the top here it's missing

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.230 
up at the top here it's missing
something<00:01:10.590> I<00:01:11.070> don't<00:01:11.759> know<00:01:11.850> anything<00:01:12.060> about

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
something I don't know anything about

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.880 
something I don't know anything about
instruments<00:01:12.689> so<00:01:13.080> I<00:01:13.110> don't<00:01:13.350> know<00:01:13.470> what<00:01:13.619> it<00:01:13.710> is

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
instruments so I don't know what it is

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.980 
instruments so I don't know what it is
but<00:01:14.960> by<00:01:16.009> logical<00:01:17.009> deduction<00:01:17.640> I<00:01:17.909> think<00:01:18.869> it

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
but by logical deduction I think it

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.670 
but by logical deduction I think it
connects<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.500> this<00:01:19.649> thing<00:01:19.950> this<00:01:20.820> little<00:01:21.680> valve

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
connects to this thing this little valve

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.730 
connects to this thing this little valve
thingy<00:01:23.100> at<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.369> top<00:01:24.080> but<00:01:25.080> that<00:01:25.350> seems<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.680> be

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
thingy at the top but that seems to be

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:26.899 
thingy at the top but that seems to be
the<00:01:25.860> only<00:01:26.009> thing<00:01:26.250> that's<00:01:26.399> missing<00:01:26.580> is

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
the only thing that's missing is

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:34.779 
the only thing that's missing is
whatever<00:01:27.439> goes<00:01:28.439> like<00:01:28.770> this<00:01:29.130> up<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.360> then<00:01:30.570> up

00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:34.789 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:41.389 

inside<00:01:35.789> the<00:01:35.909> Bell<00:01:36.590> it's<00:01:37.590> really<00:01:37.920> nice<00:01:40.399> no
