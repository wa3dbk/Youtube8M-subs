00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:05.910
 alternative safari man has king 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.429
 today a very special mission 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.690
 where in the treasure room i meet ours 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.690
 rich dutch language 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:19.080
 proverbs and expressions with 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.160
 animals in the lead role are equally numerous 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.699
 like the animals themselves 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:33.360
 why do they mean they beat something 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:35.310
 find the animals themselves also at the 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.730
 horns from 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.630
 inside means that they are upstairs as one 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.000
 quail 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.510
 means very much by being wild 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.510
 quail 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.050
 this one trumpet 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.820
 I'm not going to do it but I do have this one 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.290
 quail bait you bought in the 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.180
 quail also close store 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.530
 the fact that they exist and are used 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.770
 were in the hunt actually says so 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.980
 enough 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.619
 quails are all not or 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.610
 where does it now come from quails and 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.330
 koenders 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.520
 loomis don't fly well and flight is there 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.840
 just times if there is a fox or one 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.960
 hunting dog arrives 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.060
 lay flat on those around and they don't move 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.490
 years away thought shoes had come from 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.740
 that quail does not hear it at all 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.340
 he will take a shower, but they are deaf 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.170
 so certainly not a cat from the tree 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.940
 watching means a wait and see attitude 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.940
 but to do something for us 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:40.140
 had to look at the economy 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.470
 lose a lot of time and roam the tree 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.470
 look 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.310
 completely possible 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.950
 and so sprinkled on donkeys that spread 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.990
 not two 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.500
 on the same stone it would collapse 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.950
 loud and asses to none twice 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.750
 same stone 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.680
 and that means only a stupid one 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.630
 person 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.630
 make the same mistake twice, come in 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:26.500
 conclusion and donkeys to schedule to none 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.030
 play 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:33.580
 you have to be as slow as a whole 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.600
 very slow as paint and is fast 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.250
 yes I can do something 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.740
 propose 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.600
 but how slow are they then 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.880
 we have you to snail one 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.310

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.750

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.070
 and at three their heart rate 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:03:00.959

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.940

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:07.560
 proverb is that old books already 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.560
 even like a green leaf lust 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.550
 Populists clearly like green 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:17.550
 leaves 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.239
 candy 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.350
 to hit oneself is already a de 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.550
 strip 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.550
 at the feelers in the air 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.099
 and has clearly won between 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.169
 interface 

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:38.440
 and as slow as a snake means from 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:40.710
 400 km per hour

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:05.289

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:07.990

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:35.960
 The animals always have the last 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:40.000
 word 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.000
