you<00:00:58.089> give<00:00:58.299> an<00:00:58.540> opportunity<00:00:59.070> brand<00:01:00.070> by

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.430 
you give an opportunity brand by

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.830 
you give an opportunity brand by
initiating<00:01:01.030> different<00:01:01.720> physical<00:01:02.110> activities

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:04.840 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.929 

mental<00:01:05.840> development<00:01:06.439> that<00:01:06.920> the<00:01:07.130> best<00:01:07.429> can<00:01:07.789> be

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:07.939 
mental development that the best can be

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:11.950 
mental development that the best can be
achieved<00:01:08.329> only<00:01:08.990> up<00:01:09.170> to<00:01:09.350> the<00:01:09.469> age<00:01:09.619> of<00:01:09.829> 6<00:01:10.780> from<00:01:11.780> 6

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
achieved only up to the age of 6 from 6

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.740 
achieved only up to the age of 6 from 6
years<00:01:12.289> of<00:01:12.350> age<00:01:12.649> hence<00:01:13.189> the<00:01:13.969> development<00:01:14.600> of

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
years of age hence the development of

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.679 
years of age hence the development of
the<00:01:14.869> brain<00:01:14.990> is<00:01:15.319> very<00:01:15.619> slow

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:16.689 
the brain is very slow

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:20.020 
the brain is very slow
thus<00:01:17.689> development<00:01:18.469> in<00:01:18.649> early<00:01:19.009> stage<00:01:19.460> is<00:01:19.729> of

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
thus development in early stage is of

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.699 
thus development in early stage is of
utmost<00:01:20.329> importance<00:01:21.319> the<00:01:22.100> idle<00:01:22.579> time<00:01:22.880> is<00:01:23.709> right

00:01:24.699 --> 00:01:24.709 
utmost importance the idle time is right

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:27.099 
utmost importance the idle time is right
from<00:01:24.950> the<00:01:25.069> time<00:01:25.219> of<00:01:25.250> conception<00:01:25.759> and<00:01:26.209> during
