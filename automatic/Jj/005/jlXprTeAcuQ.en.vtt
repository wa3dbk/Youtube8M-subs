00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.619 

alright<00:00:01.110> so<00:00:01.319> this<00:00:01.469> is<00:00:01.709> my<00:00:02.669> final<00:00:02.939> setup<00:00:03.360> of

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
alright so this is my final setup of

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:10.280 
alright so this is my final setup of
what<00:00:03.750> it's<00:00:03.899> going<00:00:04.020> to<00:00:04.080> look<00:00:04.170> like<00:00:04.259> for<00:00:04.680> now<00:00:09.290> as

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
what it's going to look like for now as

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.600 
what it's going to look like for now as
you<00:00:10.410> can<00:00:10.530> see<00:00:10.590> from<00:00:10.950> the<00:00:11.099> front<00:00:11.340> you<00:00:11.580> can

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
you can see from the front you can

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.270 
you can see from the front you can
hardly<00:00:11.969> even<00:00:12.120> see<00:00:12.660> that<00:00:12.840> there<00:00:13.280> intercoolers

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
hardly even see that there intercoolers

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.320 
hardly even see that there intercoolers
even<00:00:14.549> on<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:14.820> back

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:20.330 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.420 

have<00:00:20.900> it<00:00:21.020> set<00:00:21.260> up<00:00:21.289> for<00:00:21.410> component<00:00:22.100> right<00:00:22.310> now

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:24.430 
have it set up for component right now

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:39.850 
have it set up for component right now
looks<00:00:25.430> very<00:00:25.670> much<00:00:25.850> like<00:00:26.890> stuck<00:00:29.140> anyway<00:00:31.330> so

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:48.160 

that<00:00:40.860> should<00:00:41.070> be<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.550> setup<00:00:42.379> for<00:00:43.379> combatant

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:55.760 

test<00:00:49.170> it<00:00:49.350> real<00:00:49.530> quick

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.450 

system<00:00:56.770> booting<00:00:57.160> up

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:07.450 

I<00:01:05.409> know<00:01:06.409> it<00:01:06.500> doesn't<00:01:06.650> look<00:01:06.770> great<00:01:07.010> because

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
I know it doesn't look great because

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:28.500 
I know it doesn't look great because
it's<00:01:07.610> on<00:01:07.729> this<00:01:07.850> TV<00:01:08.119> but<00:01:11.890> CRTs<00:01:12.890> do<00:01:13.070> that

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.510 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.270 

so

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
so

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.870 
so
as<00:01:30.790> I<00:01:30.940> said<00:01:31.000> before<00:01:31.180> I<00:01:31.750> don't<00:01:31.840> know<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:33.700> can

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
as I said before I don't know you can

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.590 
as I said before I don't know you can
compare<00:01:34.210> it<00:01:34.330> to<00:01:34.450> your<00:01:34.600> stock<00:01:34.900> system<00:01:36.600> it's

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
compare it to your stock system it's

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.120 
compare it to your stock system it's
very<00:01:37.840> quiet<00:01:38.080> or<00:01:38.350> compared<00:01:38.710> to<00:01:38.860> the<00:01:38.950> other

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
very quiet or compared to the other

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.399 
very quiet or compared to the other
intercoolers<00:01:39.759> it's<00:01:39.970> still<00:01:40.210> very<00:01:40.479> quiet<00:01:43.409> it

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
intercoolers it's still very quiet it

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:51.180 
intercoolers it's still very quiet it
looks<00:01:44.619> great

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.080 

you<00:01:51.580> can<00:01:51.730> see<00:01:51.970> don't<00:01:52.600> really<00:01:52.840> lose<00:01:53.020> I<00:01:54.090> mean

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
you can see don't really lose I mean

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.880 
you can see don't really lose I mean
like<00:01:55.270> I<00:01:55.420> said<00:01:55.450> before<00:01:55.720> you<00:01:56.110> can't<00:01:56.350> really<00:01:56.470> tell

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
like I said before you can't really tell

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.940 
like I said before you can't really tell
as<00:01:57.820> far<00:01:58.120> as<00:01:58.150> with<00:01:58.420> the<00:01:58.450> screen<00:01:59.020> bubbling<00:01:59.770> like

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
as far as with the screen bubbling like

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.260 
as far as with the screen bubbling like
that<00:02:00.160> but<00:02:00.310> you<00:02:00.370> don't<00:02:00.550> really<00:02:00.730> lose<00:02:01.030> any

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
that but you don't really lose any

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:11.960 
that but you don't really lose any

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
wired ethernet obviously as you can see

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.450 
wired ethernet obviously as you can see
there<00:02:39.720> the<00:02:40.260> only<00:02:40.350> downfall<00:02:40.650> i<00:02:40.980> think<00:02:41.220> you<00:02:41.310> lose

to this is if it bothers you that the

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.910 
to this is if it bothers you that the
clips<00:02:46.890> for<00:02:47.160> the<00:02:47.690> wireless<00:02:48.690> thing<00:02:49.200> are<00:02:49.709> on<00:02:49.830> the

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
clips for the wireless thing are on the

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.890 
clips for the wireless thing are on the
side<00:02:50.130> see<00:02:50.490> you<00:02:51.030> can<00:02:51.180> see<00:02:51.330> these<00:02:51.480> two<00:02:51.690> little

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
side see you can see these two little

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.900 
side see you can see these two little
holes<00:02:52.080> right<00:02:52.320> here<00:02:52.380> that's<00:02:53.130> for<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.550> wireless

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
holes right here that's for the wireless

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.860 
holes right here that's for the wireless
adapter<00:02:54.660> so<00:02:55.200> it<00:02:55.230> does<00:02:55.530> fit<00:02:55.920> but<00:02:56.310> it<00:02:56.880> doesn't

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
adapter so it does fit but it doesn't

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.900 
adapter so it does fit but it doesn't
follow<00:02:58.140> the<00:02:58.410> sleekness<00:02:58.740> of<00:02:58.890> your<00:02:59.220> system<00:02:59.670> but

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
follow the sleekness of your system but

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.160 
follow the sleekness of your system but
i<00:03:00.120> mean<00:03:01.130> it<00:03:02.130> does<00:03:02.430> the<00:03:02.910> Pelican<00:03:03.690> did<00:03:03.900> take<00:03:04.140> it

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
i mean it does the Pelican did take it

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.000
