bought<00:06:11.710> the<00:06:11.860> club<00:06:12.100> hugely<00:06:12.760> indebted<00:06:13.030> it<00:06:13.480> and

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:13.690 
bought the club hugely indebted it and

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:16.020 
bought the club hugely indebted it and
in<00:06:13.810> fact<00:06:13.990> since<00:06:14.290> that<00:06:14.560> happened<00:06:14.950> ferguson<00:06:15.880> the

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:16.030 
in fact since that happened ferguson the

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:17.550
