00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.680
 I tell you something this karina is this little face 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:31.250
 karina I want I want to tell you me some 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:33.620
 Evenings as you walk well before anything 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.780
 I want to congratulate you because I heard the 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.390
 another day recording what you're going to 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.309
 sing at night we said it's going to be 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.580
 a subject of those seen we did not say which one 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.750
 nothing but listen to it I tell you the truth 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.670
 obviously I heard it on a cell phone like that 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.320
 just if the audio from a cell phone is not the 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.780
 audio how to listen at home by the 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.610
 study and really and I do not say it because 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.550
 be here because obviously I have to 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.870
 say not really surprised me 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.360
 pleasantly and I want to congratulate you 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.239
 publicly good thank you very much 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.780
 thank you and you find it comfortable to sing in 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.780
 another language 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.659
 I did not ask for help at all because the truth is 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.159
 that nothing was a responsibility 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:15.950
 to pronounce badly and all that I asked for help with 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:20.119
 the phonetics and that because if I speak 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:22.610
 I'm just not very good at this subject 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:23.810
 how did you prepare yourself a lot I say to do 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:28.250
 this theme for the opening of showmatch 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.840
 yes yes kill me listening to it and apart here 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.000
 of the production sent me two girls 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.460
 that helped me to pronounce well and everything 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.869
 what I could but I conscious I say 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.330
 because this genre that you're going to sing 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:40.130
 we really are not going to fix the 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.570
 surprise you opened a much more fan 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.100
 simple also internationally with 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.509
 different musical genres 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.820
 I say you are going towards that path leave the 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:49.070
 tropical music and running you a kid 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.970
 for another side 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.970
 not for that goal 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.350
 but I did it here, nothing more 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.410
 josemarÃ­a said recently that he liked it 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:07.130
 a lot what you did the theme version 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:09.110
 Well, since you heard it, you liked it 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.780
 anyway I have a problem that to me 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:15.350
 a lot I do not like to hear mix or anything 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:19.540
 no but I recognize that we all did a 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.540
 good job and it's going to be nice 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.570
 perfect thanks in an enclosure 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.390
 and for them
