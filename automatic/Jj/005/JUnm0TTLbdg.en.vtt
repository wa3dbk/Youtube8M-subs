 I really want to do to all of you though 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.609

 Avidzba courtyard and this is plus 10 facts about tomb 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.090
 raider 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.410
 let's start with the most famous fact 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.660
 they say it's not the usual size of Lara's chest 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.400
 appeared by chance when toby guard 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.770
 created a model of Lara on the computer 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.970
 he accidentally exceeded the required values ​​and 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.879
 instead of 50 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.710
 inscribed 150 percent so unusual 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:01.870
 the figure loved everything 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.820
 team a executive director 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.970
 adrian smith gave the go-ahead to 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:09.400
 leave Lara just such a paradise and sizovy 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.860
 Burr plan initially for the first part 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.050
 tomb raider wondered two more 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.690
 opponents who were supposed to inhabit 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:19.780
 at the level of atlantis it is flourished 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.880
 himself and the atlantic dinosaur this fact 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.950
 became known when the players poked around 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.470
 files of one of the beta version of the game 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.390
 and in 2001, and the developers themselves 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:33.009
 told about it in the original 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:35.380
 magazine in the first game lara croft already 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.869
 should have acquired not only a scythe 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.970
 but with glasses however it exceeded 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:42.310
 allowable power consoles and in 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.000
 Lara wore glasses only in 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.220
 screensavers 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.439
 but we know with you because of the power 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:52.119
 what prefix the detail had to 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:54.430
 greatly cut in the palace of king midas 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:55.930
 on one of the high platforms you can 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.180
 notice a big first aid kit 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.520
 Well, getting to her seems impossible 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.740
 seemed impossible until one of 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.770
 players have not discovered the so-called 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.750
 corner buck corner effect if lara 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.940
 put in a certain position near 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.190
 corner and then jump then 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.860
 voila plan climbs on earlier 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.560
 inaccessible heights knew about this bug 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:21.590
 developers think the position of the first-aid kit 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.720
 gives the answer to this question or now 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.940
 during an advertising campaign in japan 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.250
 Lara Croft and the rest of the characters were 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.260
 depicted in anime style it was 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.060
 made to attract more 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.739
 attention from youth 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.800
 which is literally returned to 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:38.660
 popular culture manga and anime back in 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.580
 tomb- level japanese version 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.069
 kvalogopek and there is a niche with 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.319
 a figurine of which is not in the original but 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:48.950
 this is only a small cosmetic difference 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:51.470
 precisely to all to strongly on levels in the pen 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.900
 lari more than once suspended bridges 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.329
 in reality, such bridges are 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.790
 part of the high road club of us 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:01.069
 which was laid by the tribes of the Incas 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.110
 hundreds of kilometers of these roads and trails 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:07.750
 passes through most of the mountain 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:10.519
 systems anb and is still used 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.870
 as we learn from the game after the fall 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:14.209
 meteorite at atlantis 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.819
 the number of windows of these windows fell into different parts 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:19.280
 of light this part of the plot is not invented 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:21.340
 flat place the thing is that there is 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.599
 such a concept as an alternative story 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.940
 which is considering the possibility 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:27.769
 the existence of atlantis and and global 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.480
 disaster after which some 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:32.060
 the survivors scattered in different parts 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.709
 light and taking advantage of the atlantic 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.600
 knowledge created buildings 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.700
 colossal sizes and with large 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.190
 accuracy such buildings can 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.319
 observe in bolivia and pen and egypt and 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.959
 the principle of their creation still remains 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:46.790
 a mystery to humanity after all 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:48.040
 modern technology build 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:53.260
 like it does not show 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:55.510
 possible Egypt Lara penetrates the city 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.290
 communes which is located under the temple 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.269
 Nefertari 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.030
 and when comes back next 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:02.170
 once the city ​​is flooded what is 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.659
 caused 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:07.359
 originally the temple of Nefertari and the temple of Ramses 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:11.079
 the second was 65 meters lower 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:12.939
 present location but in 1960 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:15.790
 construction began on the Nile River 

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:17.769
 dam bringing both temples 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:21.370
 were threatened with complete flooding 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:24.759
 and as a result of the destruction of this in any way 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:27.490
 it was impossible to admit and therefore in 1964 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:29.740
 year archaeologists engineers embarked on 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:32.199
 transfer of ancient monuments to new 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.400
 the place both temples were sawn on 

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:36.039
 sets of blocks 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.650
 each weighing up to 3 tons and 

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:41.259
 after active four-year temple work 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:44.289
 Ramses II and Nefertari temple were 

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:48.900
 moved 65 meters higher and 200 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:51.430
 meters further where they were collected again and 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.409
 heated fish still finds a passage to 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.389
 underground city however in addition and 

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:57.610
 finish the business you can see the water in it 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:05:01.080
 the place sometimes falls heavily 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:04.030
 flooding the first hall and mexican fresh you 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.800
 want to get real hardcore in tomb 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:08.229
 raider developers offer 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.870
 set addition on finish business and 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:13.510
 skip the first two levels starting 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:15.669
 directly from the level of atlantis lari 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:18.070
 It will be very difficult because powerful 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:20.349
 weapons initially will not and ammunition 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:22.750
 first aid kits will need to save a lot and 

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:25.150
 bad dealer cells 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:27.100
 10 is not so much a fact as praise 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.230
 developers want to draw your 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:31.450

 various legends beautifully conveyed 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:41.200
 Entourage locations are well developed 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:42.880
 characters and their relationship games 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.500
 you can meet things that will become 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.340
 understandable only when repeated 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.650
 passing 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.300
 for example a set of boxes labeled 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:50.740
 the plan is intentionally arranged in a row 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:53.320
 creating an anagram 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:56.740
 and on the thrones of the rulers are written the letters y 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:58.930
 t n that is, to the claw act hogom and natla 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:01.350
 that hints at the origin of the villain 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:04.240

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:05.590
 games to the eyeballs are crammed with details 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.550
 which at each repeated 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:08.500
 research
