00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:18.169
 v3 compact charger for 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:23.400
 charging lithium polymer batteries 

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:26.429
 two and three cans of this 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.019
 device compactness no 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:28.740
 need to use an external unit 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:35.100
 power supply 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:36.780
 it is already arranged no need 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:42.540
 settings ask everything is done 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:49.250
 automatically this device charges and 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:49.250
 balances the battery cons of it 

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:57.900
 high- capacity batteries charge enough 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:01:06.479
 long since the current delivered by the device 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:08.820
 it is 0808 amps well and also not 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:13.200
 ability to monitor characteristics 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:15.390
 charging how much voltage is infused 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.110
 canned but I will note 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.950
 still balance the battery like 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:25.520
 running charging with 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.520
 balance connectors 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:44.930
 let's set the battery with a capacity of 610 milliampere 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:50.580
 hours, check the voltage before charging 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:52.740
 398 397 396 put on charge and then 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:57.000
 check already how he charged you 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:02:01.500
 I want to balance this battery 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.630
 batteries have not been doing well for 3 years 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.560
 even balanced on quality 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:13.040
 chargers, let's see 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:13.040
 connect key 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:21.600
 lit up three indicators it show 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:27.170
 that three cans are burning red at the moment 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.170
 the end of charging they light up green 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.019
 The process of charging us appeared next 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:39.390
 indication shows that two banks have already 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:44.269
 1 bank is still not fully charged 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.269
 charged charging process continues 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:56.700
 so charging is over indicator 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:59.120
 greenback check how he charged 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.120
 battery 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:12.590
 322 422 421 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.590
 421
