but at the same time I like to keep the

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.660 
but at the same time I like to keep the
templates<00:02:24.209> very<00:02:24.510> large<00:02:24.930> very<00:02:25.799> easy<00:02:26.189> to<00:02:26.489> work

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
with how they take apart the six blocks

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.879 
with how they take apart the six blocks
are<00:02:29.790> placed<00:02:30.150> they're<00:02:30.629> flipped<00:02:31.109> and<00:02:31.530> different

are placed they're flipped and different

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:33.949 
are placed they're flipped and different
type<00:02:32.069> of<00:02:32.250> rotation<00:02:32.609> at<00:02:32.969> that<00:02:33.150> point<00:02:33.450> if<00:02:33.840> you

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
type of rotation at that point if you

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.679 
type of rotation at that point if you
get<00:02:34.079> a<00:02:34.139> very<00:02:34.260> whimsical<00:02:34.889> look<00:02:35.459> with<00:02:35.730> it<00:02:35.909> a<00:02:36.090> very

this<00:03:13.409> would<00:03:13.709> be<00:03:13.829> a<00:03:13.859> very<00:03:14.219> simple<00:03:14.909> quilt<00:03:15.900> to<00:03:16.109> be

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
this would be a very simple quilt to be

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.250 
this would be a very simple quilt to be
able<00:03:16.349> to<00:03:16.590> increase<00:03:17.040> it's<00:03:17.819> all<00:03:18.000> based<00:03:18.299> on<00:03:18.569> a<00:03:18.629> 14

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
able to increase it's all based on a 14

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.770 
able to increase it's all based on a 14
inch<00:03:19.530> block<00:03:19.949> and<00:03:20.430> so<00:03:21.209> therefore<00:03:21.419> if<00:03:21.690> you

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
inch block and so therefore if you

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.409 
inch block and so therefore if you
wanted<00:03:22.079> to<00:03:22.169> add<00:03:22.319> another<00:03:22.919> row<00:03:23.280> of<00:03:23.849> the<00:03:24.180> birds

wanted to add another row of the birds

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:26.629 
wanted to add another row of the birds
you<00:03:24.599> could<00:03:24.900> go<00:03:25.019> ahead<00:03:25.139> and<00:03:25.260> rotate<00:03:25.769> those<00:03:26.069> or

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:26.639 
you could go ahead and rotate those or

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:28.759 
you could go ahead and rotate those or
you<00:03:26.699> could<00:03:26.879> also<00:03:27.030> add<00:03:27.419> width<00:03:27.750> so<00:03:28.379> that<00:03:28.409> really

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
you could also add width so that really

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.629 
you could also add width so that really

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:47.669 
think the fun portion of this quilt this

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:50.119 
think the fun portion of this quilt this
is<00:03:47.879> again<00:03:48.509> with<00:03:48.720> the<00:03:48.870> meadow<00:03:49.109> line<00:03:49.439> of<00:03:49.620> fabric

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:50.129 
is again with the meadow line of fabric

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:52.550 
is again with the meadow line of fabric
it's<00:03:50.310> a<00:03:50.459> repeating<00:03:51.060> block<00:03:51.329> but<00:03:51.959> what's<00:03:52.139> really

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
it's a repeating block but what's really

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.429 
it's a repeating block but what's really
nice<00:03:52.739> about<00:03:52.799> this<00:03:53.129> is<00:03:53.519> the<00:03:53.699> use<00:03:53.939> of<00:03:53.970> the<00:03:54.959> fabric

00:03:55.429 --> 00:03:55.439 
nice about this is the use of the fabric

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:57.770 
nice about this is the use of the fabric
the<00:03:55.650> value<00:03:56.069> some<00:03:56.370> of<00:03:56.489> the<00:03:56.609> blocks<00:03:56.909> really<00:03:57.509> show

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
the value some of the blocks really show

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.330 
the value some of the blocks really show
up<00:03:57.989> like<00:03:58.229> when<00:03:58.439> you<00:03:58.560> look<00:03:58.769> at<00:03:58.889> this<00:03:59.040> one<00:03:59.220> you

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
up like when you look at this one you

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.909 
up like when you look at this one you
can<00:03:59.519> really<00:03:59.849> see<00:04:00.090> the<00:04:00.239> design<00:04:00.419> and<00:04:00.989> then<00:04:01.530> some

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:01.919 
can really see the design and then some

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:03.830 
can really see the design and then some
kind<00:04:02.189> of<00:04:02.400> blend<00:04:02.729> in<00:04:02.939> and<00:04:03.090> I<00:04:03.180> think<00:04:03.449> when<00:04:03.659> you

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
kind of blend in and I think when you

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.710 
kind of blend in and I think when you
change<00:04:04.530> the<00:04:04.829> value<00:04:05.340> or<00:04:05.549> you<00:04:06.150> use<00:04:06.419> lower

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
change the value or you use lower

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.080 
change the value or you use lower

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
contrast fabrics the eye needs to look

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.789

at<00:04:09.299> it<00:04:09.419> a<00:04:09.509> little<00:04:09.689> bit<00:04:09.930> longer<00:04:10.169> to<00:04:10.500> kind<00:04:10.709> of

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
at it a little bit longer to kind of

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:12.559 
at it a little bit longer to kind of
discern<00:04:11.189> what<00:04:11.430> the<00:04:11.549> pattern<00:04:11.939> is

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569 
discern what the pattern is
