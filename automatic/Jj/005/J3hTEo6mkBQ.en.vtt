00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.039
 then so quickly to the extent that we have qaeda to the car 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.199
 but if you do not have it yet, we always have enough music 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.029
 computer 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.939
 but the way 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.310

 I do not know let's see then adams 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.889
 it's a very favor way of the heat 

00:00:56.889 --> 00:01:00.629
 to part since January was from crusoe site to buy some music 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.870
 also allows you to create your own lists 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.140
 by different genres like mercy right now by my date 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.840
 there also another little question that I get a lot of exquisite low addiction like that 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.000
 you can add music from another side if it has 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.230
 against sidi and sae already earlier or maybe both their music through the 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.630
 memory for maybe parents both I teased 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.380
 very easy you can add your music of the move by putting the music a folder 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.480
 and leaves landed the drought 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.429
 appears 

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:37.719
 here in music or also if you just get into the cid area and equity has 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.329
 from the computer it will look like a little screen 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:45.959
 and this will then be able to download that music are your computer and attend them 

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:47.580
 stored here 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.730
 but the question I received on facebook but from there to someone 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.740
 it was if I could burn discs 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.290
 in your web, they are very easy to do, so first thing that we are going to do 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.870
 is to have a new folder that this easier and so I do 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:03.630
 let's go to the cinema to see more here 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.810
 I already killed the folder we are going to put him 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.939
 we came to believe a new cinema 

00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:11.949
 and do not believe me or chocolates and again 

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:13.169
 and this fine 

00:02:13.169 --> 00:02:17.719
 now let's choose the music can be one by one and can very well 

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:19.149
 jalapa 

00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:23.010
 dragging the music to the folder as civil as Ben Ali 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.710
 or maybe we put new complete that we already have the computer 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.949
 here they see that I have of the virus 

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:31.249
 a group a famous 

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:34.059
 they do not know it then we are going to select 

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:38.599
 all of them and here we see that we are at the beginning the oil that we take 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:40.640
 grabs you have to click 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.649
 drag the 17 or 27 songs 

00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:45.379
 to civil 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:49.760
 we opened that folder and as we have here we have all those songs now I see 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.760
 what we are going to have to do is go there 

00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:58.130
 for brown 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.689
 let's go easy 

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:02.689
 there we went down to society who were green 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:08.279
 Then, with that, we're going to ask us ken saro temos 

00:03:08.279 --> 00:03:11.279
 if not more than twenty way we want it 

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:17.539
 at home the cid and will also be done by audio or by mp3 and has an mp3 player or 

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:21.499
 you can even burn your own photos this drag photos here to be able 

00:03:21.499 --> 00:03:24.240
 do a course split of de data 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.290
 then this choice is very versatile 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.930
 it gets more going to allow you in that art up here 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.130
 the blank disc and already with that is going to be able to burn his disc then that was 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:37.209
 all for now 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:40.309
 how are we going to cancel all this from here? 

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:44.549
 very easy one day I recommend it very very good also have 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.329
 a program called peking 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:48.609
 in common 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:52.999
 as a social music network so that it can disturb everything there with 

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:56.659
 your friend to see what a musical they have to be buying and other stroke 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:01.140
