stainless steel cuff bracelet blank and
this<00:00:17.850> one<00:00:18.029> is<00:00:18.180> three<00:00:18.449> quarters<00:00:18.810> of<00:00:18.930> an<00:00:19.050> inch

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
this one is three quarters of an inch

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.710 
this one is three quarters of an inch
wide<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:19.859> you'll<00:00:20.550> notice<00:00:20.939> that<00:00:21.180> it<00:00:21.300> has<00:00:21.330> a<00:00:21.480> bit

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
wide and you'll notice that it has a bit

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.929 
wide and you'll notice that it has a bit
of<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:21.900> twist<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.320> it<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:22.769> that's<00:00:22.949> from<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.400> way

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
of a twist to it and that's from the way

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.820 
of a twist to it and that's from the way
that<00:00:24.090> it's<00:00:24.240> produced<00:00:24.600> so<00:00:25.230> what<00:00:25.439> I<00:00:25.470> do<00:00:25.590> is<00:00:25.800> I

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
that it's produced so what I do is I

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.460 
that it's produced so what I do is I
have<00:00:26.070> a<00:00:26.099> couple<00:00:26.400> pair<00:00:26.730> of<00:00:27.000> flat<00:00:27.480> nose<00:00:27.720> pliers<00:00:27.750> I

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
have a couple pair of flat nose pliers I

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.279 
have a couple pair of flat nose pliers I
put<00:00:29.189> some<00:00:29.429> tape<00:00:29.699> electrical<00:00:30.269> tape<00:00:30.779> around<00:00:30.960> the

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
put some tape electrical tape around the

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.500 
put some tape electrical tape around the
ends<00:00:31.710> just<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.399> keep<00:00:32.520> from<00:00:32.759> marring<00:00:33.180> the

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
ends just to keep from marring the

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.660 
ends just to keep from marring the
finish<00:00:33.930> of<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.230> metal<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:35.250> just<00:00:35.399> give<00:00:35.579> it<00:00:35.610> a

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
finish of the metal and just give it a

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.130 
finish of the metal and just give it a
little<00:00:35.820> twist<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.329> that'll<00:00:36.600> straighten<00:00:36.930> that

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
little twist and that'll straighten that

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.450 
little twist and that'll straighten that
right<00:00:37.200> out<00:00:38.660> and<00:00:39.660> then<00:00:39.809> after<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.260> do<00:00:40.469> that<00:00:40.500> and

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
right out and then after you do that and

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.520

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
you'll notice there's a little bit of a

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.639 
you'll notice there's a little bit of a
curve<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:43.829> it<00:00:44.280> so<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:44.550> just<00:00:44.700> kind<00:00:44.940> of

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:45.649 
curve to it so you just kind of

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:47.600 
curve to it so you just kind of
straighten<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:46.739> out<00:00:46.800> with<00:00:47.010> your<00:00:47.100> hands<00:00:47.520> it

particular belt happens to be 80 grit I
took<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:04.080> off<00:01:04.199> of<00:01:04.229> my<00:01:04.589> stationary<00:01:05.250> belt<00:01:05.519> sander

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
took it off of my stationary belt sander

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.440 
took it off of my stationary belt sander
so<00:01:06.390> it's<00:01:06.630> used<00:01:06.960> it's<00:01:07.530> still<00:01:08.250> plenty<00:01:08.549> sharp<00:01:08.580> to

nice and vertical and go back and forth

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.120 
nice and vertical and go back and forth
very<00:01:27.780> easy<00:01:28.080> doesn't<00:01:28.530> take<00:01:28.650> a<00:01:28.680> lot<00:01:28.829> of<00:01:28.890> effort

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
very easy doesn't take a lot of effort

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.330 
very easy doesn't take a lot of effort
that's<00:01:29.909> got<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.450> smooth<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.140> then<00:01:31.829> next<00:01:32.220> thing

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
of bird that might be there so we'll

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.249 
of bird that might be there so we'll
just<00:01:35.369> kind<00:01:35.579> of<00:01:35.700> tilt<00:01:36.030> it<00:01:36.210> all<00:01:36.420> about<00:01:36.630> 45

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
just kind of tilt it all about 45

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.580 
just kind of tilt it all about 45
degrees<00:01:37.590> or<00:01:37.799> so<00:01:38.090> same<00:01:39.090> thing<00:01:39.479> just<00:01:40.110> go<00:01:40.290> back

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
degrees or so same thing just go back

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.450 
degrees or so same thing just go back
and<00:01:40.829> forth<00:01:42.320> we'll<00:01:43.320> flip<00:01:43.590> it<00:01:43.740> over<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:44.070> do<00:01:44.280> the

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
and forth we'll flip it over and do the

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.080 
and forth we'll flip it over and do the
other<00:01:44.490> side

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
other side

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.639 
other side
that<00:01:47.090> should<00:01:47.329> say<00:01:47.539> the<00:01:47.719> other<00:01:47.960> corner<00:01:48.380> of<00:01:48.469> that

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
that should say the other corner of that

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:55.920 
that should say the other corner of that
edge<00:01:48.979> and<00:01:49.340> that<00:01:49.369> edge<00:01:50.149> is<00:01:50.509> all<00:01:50.659> done<00:01:50.899> now<00:01:52.689> side

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
rate doesn't create a lot of dust in

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.740 
rate doesn't create a lot of dust in
fact<00:02:13.459> pretty<00:02:13.700> much<00:02:13.880> no<00:02:14.090> dust<00:02:14.360> at<00:02:14.510> all<00:02:14.630> the

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
fact pretty much no dust at all the

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.170 
fact pretty much no dust at all the
stage<00:02:14.989> right<00:02:15.260> on<00:02:15.380> the<00:02:15.530> belt<00:02:15.769> and<00:02:16.640> that<00:02:16.910> will<00:02:17.030> do

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
stage right on the belt and that will do

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.970 
stage right on the belt and that will do
the<00:02:17.300> end<00:02:17.510> and<00:02:17.870> usually<00:02:18.140> just<00:02:18.319> kind<00:02:18.470> of<00:02:18.620> drag

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
the end and usually just kind of drag

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:35.160 
the end and usually just kind of drag
across<00:02:19.340> there<00:02:32.680> you<00:02:33.680> can<00:02:33.830> use<00:02:34.010> this<00:02:34.220> like<00:02:34.459> I<00:02:34.489> say

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
across there you can use this like I say

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:46.479 
across there you can use this like I say
stainless<00:02:36.170> steel<00:02:36.410> here<00:02:45.040> there<00:02:46.040> we<00:02:46.160> have<00:02:46.340> it

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
stainless steel here there we have it

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:48.910 
stainless steel here there we have it
all<00:02:46.760> four<00:02:47.150> sides<00:02:47.540> of<00:02:47.989> this<00:02:48.200> all<00:02:48.500> four<00:02:48.739> edges

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
all four sides of this all four edges

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.640 
all four sides of this all four edges
rather<00:02:49.340> are<00:02:49.700> nice<00:02:50.090> and<00:02:50.329> smooth<00:02:50.630> and<00:02:50.930> now<00:02:51.590> the

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
rather are nice and smooth and now the

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.229 
rather are nice and smooth and now the
other<00:02:51.890> thing<00:02:52.100> you'll<00:02:52.250> notice<00:02:52.310> is<00:02:52.760> that<00:02:52.819> the

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
other thing you'll notice is that the

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:55.809 
other thing you'll notice is that the
corners<00:02:53.690> are<00:02:53.959> fully<00:02:54.260> squared<00:02:54.739> and<00:02:55.010> especially

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
corners are fully squared and especially

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:57.699 
corners are fully squared and especially
for<00:02:56.000> a<00:02:56.030> cuff<00:02:56.269> bracelet<00:02:56.630> it<00:02:56.900> may<00:02:56.989> stand<00:02:57.260> makes

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
for a cuff bracelet it may stand makes

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.740 
for a cuff bracelet it may stand makes
sense<00:02:57.980> to<00:02:58.130> have<00:02:58.250> them<00:02:58.459> rounded<00:02:58.880> we're<00:02:59.569> just

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
sense to have them rounded we're just

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.620 
sense to have them rounded we're just
gonna<00:02:59.840> use<00:03:00.079> this<00:03:00.260> same<00:03:00.530> belt<00:03:01.329> same<00:03:02.329> thing

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
gonna use this same belt same thing

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:03.970 
gonna use this same belt same thing
except<00:03:02.930> this<00:03:03.079> time<00:03:03.260> we're<00:03:03.440> only<00:03:03.530> going<00:03:03.799> to

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
except this time we're only going to

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.539 
except this time we're only going to
drag<00:03:04.280> across<00:03:04.660> and<00:03:05.660> as<00:03:06.019> we<00:03:06.170> do<00:03:06.380> we<00:03:07.069> just<00:03:07.250> want<00:03:07.459> to

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
drag across and as we do we just want to

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:14.140 
drag across and as we do we just want to
rotate<00:03:07.730> it<00:03:08.000> up<00:03:11.859> and<00:03:12.859> as<00:03:13.160> you<00:03:13.250> can<00:03:13.400> tell<00:03:13.639> that

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
rotate it up and as you can tell that

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.770 
rotate it up and as you can tell that
corners<00:03:14.690> round<00:03:15.170> it<00:03:15.319> over<00:03:15.880> you<00:03:16.880> want<00:03:17.030> even<00:03:17.359> more

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
corners round it over you want even more

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.140 
corners round it over you want even more
behind<00:03:18.650> the<00:03:18.859> corner<00:03:19.220> you<00:03:19.340> just<00:03:19.400> drag<00:03:19.760> it<00:03:19.880> a<00:03:19.940> few

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
behind the corner you just drag it a few

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:38.440 
behind the corner you just drag it a few
more<00:03:20.299> times<00:03:20.359> and<00:03:21.049> you'll<00:03:21.230> be<00:03:21.350> done<00:03:37.239> that's<00:03:38.239> it

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
more times and you'll be done that's it

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.900 
more times and you'll be done that's it
all<00:03:38.900> four<00:03:39.200> corners<00:03:39.470> are<00:03:39.709> rounded<00:03:39.829> over<00:03:40.340> now

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
all four corners are rounded over now

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.729 
all four corners are rounded over now
doing<00:03:41.269> that<00:03:41.299> we've<00:03:41.630> created<00:03:42.019> just<00:03:42.230> a<00:03:42.500> slight

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
doing that we've created just a slight

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:46.780 
doing that we've created just a slight
burr<00:03:43.010> on<00:03:43.040> there<00:03:43.519> so<00:03:44.060> I've<00:03:44.150> just<00:03:44.180> kind<00:03:44.510> of<00:03:45.790> real

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
burr on there so I've just kind of real

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.620 
burr on there so I've just kind of real
shallow<00:03:47.680> angle<00:03:48.680> on<00:03:49.160> that<00:03:49.400> corner<00:03:49.819> and<00:03:50.120> that'll

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
shallow angle on that corner and that'll

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.020 
shallow angle on that corner and that'll
drop<00:03:50.780> that<00:03:51.079> off<00:03:51.349> and<00:03:51.709> you<00:03:51.889> just<00:03:52.069> kind<00:03:52.310> of

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
drop that off and you just kind of

00:03:53.030 --> 00:04:00.890 
drop that off and you just kind of
flip<00:03:54.030> it<00:03:54.180> over<00:03:54.300> and<00:03:59.090> all<00:04:00.090> four<00:04:00.360> corners<00:04:00.630> are

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
flip it over and all four corners are

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.930 
flip it over and all four corners are
rounded<00:04:00.989> over<00:04:01.470> all<00:04:01.680> four<00:04:02.069> edges<00:04:02.310> are<00:04:02.610> smooth

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
rounded over all four edges are smooth

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.290 
rounded over all four edges are smooth
now<00:04:03.660> I'm<00:04:03.780> going<00:04:04.020> to<00:04:04.140> put<00:04:04.319> some<00:04:04.530> pictures<00:04:04.980> on<00:04:05.310> my
