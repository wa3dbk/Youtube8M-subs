loosey so you want to go that way type
in<00:01:24.540> this<00:01:24.810> will<00:01:25.080> go<00:01:25.170> with<00:01:25.260> the<00:01:25.350> half<00:01:25.530> turn<00:01:25.770> on

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
in this will go with the half turn on

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:33.200 
in this will go with the half turn on
these<00:01:28.100> and<00:01:29.240> as<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.390> get<00:01:31.130> to<00:01:32.130> truing<00:01:32.970> wheels

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
these and as you get to truing wheels

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.020 
these and as you get to truing wheels
more<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.659> more<00:01:33.840> you'll<00:01:34.830> figure<00:01:35.369> out<00:01:35.520> how<00:01:35.760> much

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
more and more you'll figure out how much

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.770 
more and more you'll figure out how much
you<00:01:36.270> should<00:01:36.299> tourney<00:01:37.940> depending<00:01:38.940> on<00:01:39.119> how

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
you should tourney depending on how

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.280 
you should tourney depending on how
tight<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.590> spokes<00:01:41.100> are<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.610> like<00:01:42.450> how<00:01:42.750> far<00:01:43.049> it

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
tight the spokes are and like how far it

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.530 
tight the spokes are and like how far it
went<00:01:43.830> to<00:01:44.100> that<00:01:44.250> side<00:01:44.580> like<00:01:44.909> how<00:01:45.150> loud<00:01:45.390> it<00:01:45.510> was

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
went to that side like how loud it was

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.859 
went to that side like how loud it was
running<00:01:46.640> it's<00:01:47.640> just<00:01:47.909> practice<00:01:48.180> really<00:01:50.360> so<00:01:51.360> go

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
running it's just practice really so go

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.450 
running it's just practice really so go
out<00:01:51.900> and<00:01:52.080> build<00:01:52.590> one<00:01:52.860> of<00:01:52.890> these<00:01:55.130> and<00:01:56.130> get<00:01:56.280> your

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
out and build one of these and get your

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.050 
out and build one of these and get your
wheels<00:01:56.700> too<00:01:58.340> yeah<00:01:59.340> look<00:01:59.580> at<00:01:59.700> that

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
wheels too yeah look at that

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:07.350 
wheels too yeah look at that
well<00:02:01.509> I<00:02:02.430> struggle<00:02:03.430> um<00:02:05.040> however<00:02:06.040> so<00:02:06.640> in<00:02:06.970> like

don't remember because my camera isn't
showing<00:02:13.599> the<00:02:13.810> time<00:02:14.020> we've<00:02:14.260> gotten<00:02:14.680> it<00:02:15.540> that

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
showing the time we've gotten it that

showing the time we've gotten it that
much<00:02:16.870> true<00:02:17.230> compared<00:02:17.739> to<00:02:17.860> how<00:02:17.950> it<00:02:18.160> originally

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
much true compared to how it originally

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.180 
much true compared to how it originally
was<00:02:18.959> it's<00:02:19.959> still<00:02:20.170> a<00:02:20.230> bit<00:02:20.440> off<00:02:20.590> but<00:02:20.860> I<00:02:20.920> mean<00:02:21.069> you

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
hours to get a wheel true like my back

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:35.789 
hours to get a wheel true like my back
wheel<00:02:34.480> took<00:02:34.720> me<00:02:34.840> like<00:02:34.959> five<00:02:35.230> hours<00:02:35.260> to<00:02:35.709> get

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
wheel took me like five hours to get

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:38.520 
wheel took me like five hours to get
that<00:02:35.950> true<00:02:36.250> and<00:02:36.600> it's<00:02:37.600> been<00:02:37.750> holding<00:02:38.080> up<00:02:38.200> for

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
that true and it's been holding up for

look<00:03:11.380> at<00:03:11.470> those<00:03:11.590> that<00:03:11.769> often<00:03:14.070> and<00:03:15.180> I<00:03:16.180> think

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
look at those that often and I think

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.699 
look at those that often and I think
that's<00:03:17.380> all<00:03:17.620> you<00:03:17.829> really<00:03:17.980> need<00:03:18.310> to<00:03:18.370> know<00:03:18.549> Oh

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
that's all you really need to know Oh

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.660 
that's all you really need to know Oh
once<00:03:20.709> you're<00:03:20.799> done<00:03:20.890> truing<00:03:21.250> it<00:03:21.400> make<00:03:21.549> sure

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
once you're done truing it make sure

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.069 
once you're done truing it make sure
that<00:03:21.880> the<00:03:21.970> tension<00:03:22.299> on<00:03:22.390> the<00:03:22.510> spokes<00:03:22.810> is

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.079 
that the tension on the spokes is

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:24.990 
that the tension on the spokes is
roughly<00:03:23.590> the<00:03:23.739> same<00:03:23.950> and<00:03:24.250> that<00:03:24.310> there's<00:03:24.700> no

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
roughly the same and that there's no

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.979 
roughly the same and that there's no
spokes<00:03:26.160> poking<00:03:27.160> out<00:03:27.280> of<00:03:27.310> the<00:03:27.430> spoke<00:03:27.730> hole

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
spokes poking out of the spoke hole

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.539 
spokes poking out of the spoke hole
because<00:03:28.989> that's<00:03:29.200> what<00:03:29.620> pops<00:03:29.889> the<00:03:30.100> rims<00:03:30.280> and

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
because that's what pops the rims and

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:32.910 
because that's what pops the rims and
stuff<00:03:30.760> like<00:03:30.910> that<00:03:31.079> you<00:03:32.079> know<00:03:32.109> just<00:03:32.470> stuff<00:03:32.709> you

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
stuff like that you know just stuff you

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.150 
stuff like that you know just stuff you
should<00:03:33.100> already<00:03:33.250> know<00:03:33.609> and<00:03:33.819> then<00:03:35.010> you<00:03:36.010> should

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
should already know and then you should

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.190 
should already know and then you should
be<00:03:36.280> pretty<00:03:36.430> good<00:03:36.549> to<00:03:36.760> go<00:03:37.030> and<00:03:37.750> go<00:03:37.959> ride<00:03:38.170> your
