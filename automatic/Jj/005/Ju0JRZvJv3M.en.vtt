00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.430
 well, 4k format finally entered 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.320
 our life and ceased to be exotic 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.029
 today to maintain it even available 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:21.619
 monitors with one of them we are now 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:24.680
 let's go go appearance 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:26.930
 monitor and make 287 course modern 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.880
 thin frame strict style but where 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.710
 more important than the convenience of connecting sources 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.180
 the signal of the foot monitor does not allow 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.309
 just tilt it or adjust by 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.690
 height but also turn the monitor on 90 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:40.780
 degrees turning it into portrait mode 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.780
 and provide easy cable connection 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.140
 then you can return it to the original 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:50.059
 position 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:51.500
 no problem but it's good that 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:53.090
 implemented portrait mode is not for 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.480
 convenience of connection to work with 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:58.430
 text pdf with code and retouching 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.809
 portrait mode by the way read with 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.370
 monitor is a pleasure to many 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.039
 thanks to flicker free technology and 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.210
 ikea stand itself is also equipped with 

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:07.360
 turning disk and if necessary 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.649
 rotates with the monitor 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.210
 original solution of jesus 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:14.300
 monitor control buttons located 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.310
 behind me is comfortable and logical and above each 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.569
 label we see one or another of its item 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.459
 or an action icon which 

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:22.390
 happens at the touch of a button to us is 

00:01:19.459 --> 00:01:22.390
 liked the decision 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:28.509
 in full hd resolution it fits twice 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.140
 on hd 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:32.619
 and in ultra hd 4k it fits 4 times on full 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.770
 hd 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:37.780
 but the name 4k does not come from this from 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.750
 about 4000 pixels long 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.229
 side of frame 4k may be several 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.840
 types 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:46.450
 but we will only talk about ultra hd 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.009
 and full hd and ultra and wherever possible 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.469
 place on the same square 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:54.159
 monitor screen for example let's take 

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:57.939
 28 inches diagonal as ways had 287 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:02:00.310
 kb and aspect ratio of 16 to 9 density 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:02.020
 pixels will be different for ultra eddy 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.189
 157 pixels per inch 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.629
 less than 80 pixels for full hd 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.549
 visibility will add experience with electronic 

00:02:07.629 --> 00:02:12.790
 microscope look at the density 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:14.799
 monitors with full hd and ultra hd matrices 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.750
 is it worth saying that with increased 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:17.410
 pixel density on the same 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.019
 square 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.209
 4k monitor and demonstrate much more 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:22.900
 clarity and the absence of a ladder on 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.049
 diagonals 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.660
 but it's not all in the screen 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:31.180
 Ultra hd monitor fits into four 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.810
 more information than full screen 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.609
 hd 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.019
 ultra high resolution spawns 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:37.480
 some problems in windows up 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:40.950
 version 8 and 1 but about this end of the video 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:43.569
 show back to the study of St. Petersburg 287 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.579
 the monitor is equipped with tn matrix but let you 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.950
 It does not confuse the matrix is â€‹â€‹excellent 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:50.349
 there is no quality color distortion even 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.359
 sharp viewing angles image only 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:53.650
 some lightens however some 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:55.900
 distortions may be present when 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.489
 work in portrait mode while 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.530
 response speed is only one millisecond 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:01.239
 gray to gray and uniformity 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.430
 backlight geometry color rendering 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:04.750
 do not cause complaints by and large 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.700
 on this monitor you can comfortably 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.620
 work with video editing programs and 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.810
 programs for 3d modeling are not 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.730
 resorting to an extra display all 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.599
 interface elements fit perfectly 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.669
 on one screen 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:18.280
 By the way, this video is mounted with 

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:21.069
 using this monitor 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.270
 among connectivity and speed interfaces 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:24.430
 and 287 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:27.819
 you will not find outdated gd and even 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.230
 only displayport and 2114 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:30.910
 combined with mhl 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.319
 thanks to the last you can 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.670
 attach to the monitor image with 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:35.290
 tablet or smartphone 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.110
 menu allows you to switch between 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.239
 inputs yes to frequency 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.430
 updates were 60 hertz needed in 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:44.680
 menu display port stream toggle 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.900
 the value on 1 and 2 of the monitor menu is pretty 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.520
 extensive here you can find all the necessary 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.590
 balance settings and 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.510
 color temperature contrast and 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.620
 brightness and use mode 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.420
 picture-in-picture 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.890
 or go-kart next to the picture change 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.840
 sound source adjust volume 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.880
 real speakers which by the way 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:04.000
 tell me enough for games and 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.680
 movies sound loud quality except 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.480
 Other things in the menu pleased opportunity 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.480
 change its transparency is a useful option 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:14.569
 now as for working with such 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.760
 high resolution operating 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:18.530
 windows user systems 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.239
 sex does not concern them all and so 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.550
 good from high resolution too 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.229
 since the monitor resolution is very 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.090
 high then individual items and 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:28.100
 interface of the operating system itself 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.320
 program interfaces are very 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:33.289
 shallower more or less this problem 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.300
 solved windows 8 and 1 however in the seven 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:37.340
 you can live you need to increase the font and 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.590
 interface menu elements resolution 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.880
 screen make text and other elements 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.979
 more or less 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:46.789
 shift by the way can be increased by 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:48.590
 arbitrary percentage and as we promised 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:50.330
 last video see how well 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.669
 modern graphics card copes with 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:54.889
 so high resolution we launched 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:56.960
 hitman absolution test with 4k settings 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:59.990
 when using not overclocked nvidia 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:02.270
 gtx 780 as you can see the maximum quality 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:04.370
 unplayable card required above 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.229
 class preferably with two jikia or 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.789
 two cards but on the threshold of new 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:09.560
 generation of video cards so economical 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:11.690
 gamers wait is long but 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.729
 video editor he is a designer partly 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.830
 photographer and top gaming owners 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:16.760
 as long as everyone who works 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.500
 serious 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.419
 we could safely recommend today 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:24.130
 such monitor purchase price now 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:24.130
 is about 30,000 rubles
