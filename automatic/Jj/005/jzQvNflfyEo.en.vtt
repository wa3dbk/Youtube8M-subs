the things they wanted you to do so what
could<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.090> programmers<00:01:51.630> do<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:51.990> make<00:01:52.140> this

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
could the programmers do to make this

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.070 
could the programmers do to make this
game<00:01:52.530> even<00:01:52.830> worse<00:01:53.370> than<00:01:54.060> adding<00:01:54.450> a<00:01:54.659> dissy

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
game even worse than adding a dissy

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.640 
game even worse than adding a dissy
camera<00:01:55.610> wonky<00:01:56.610> controls<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.450> boring<00:01:58.260> levels

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650 
camera wonky controls and boring levels

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.219 
camera wonky controls and boring levels
oh<00:01:58.860> I<00:01:59.159> don't<00:01:59.460> know<00:01:59.700> how<00:02:00.210> about<00:02:00.390> making<00:02:00.840> a<00:02:00.930> bunch

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
oh I don't know how about making a bunch

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.830 
oh I don't know how about making a bunch
of<00:02:01.380> precision<00:02:02.010> long<00:02:02.250> jumps<00:02:02.790> that<00:02:03.240> if<00:02:03.360> you<00:02:03.540> miss

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
of precision long jumps that if you miss

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.080 
of precision long jumps that if you miss
you'll<00:02:04.380> have<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.680> redo<00:02:05.190> most<00:02:05.490> of<00:02:05.640> that<00:02:05.790> level

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
you'll have to redo most of that level

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.690 
you'll have to redo most of that level
again<00:02:06.210> I<00:02:06.840> couldn't<00:02:07.650> believe<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.369> amount<00:02:08.399> of

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
again I couldn't believe the amount of

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.999 
again I couldn't believe the amount of
jumps<00:02:09.060> I<00:02:09.149> had<00:02:09.360> to<00:02:09.479> do<00:02:09.690> and<00:02:09.989> some<00:02:10.739> of<00:02:10.859> them

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
jumps I had to do and some of them

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.489 
jumps I had to do and some of them
require<00:02:11.219> doing<00:02:12.180> a<00:02:12.269> double<00:02:12.659> jump<00:02:12.900> with<00:02:13.469> a

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:13.499 
require doing a double jump with a

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:16.520 
require doing a double jump with a
waggle<00:02:14.040> of<00:02:14.159> the<00:02:14.340> nunchuck<00:02:14.939> that's<00:02:15.779> right

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530

nunchuck the characters you had to

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.610 
nunchuck the characters you had to
control<00:02:21.150> were<00:02:21.630> too<00:02:21.870> small<00:02:22.260> for<00:02:22.500> the

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
the point of ridiculousness

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.400 
the point of ridiculousness
the<00:02:35.640> programmers<00:02:36.300> put<00:02:36.480> in<00:02:36.630> the<00:02:36.780> laziest

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
knew they were making a bad game so they

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.960 
knew they were making a bad game so they
didn't<00:02:43.020> care<00:02:43.260> all<00:02:44.040> you<00:02:44.310> have<00:02:44.430> to<00:02:44.550> do<00:02:44.670> is<00:02:44.790> just

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
didn't care all you have to do is just

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.550 
didn't care all you have to do is just
keep<00:02:45.209> walking<00:02:45.720> and<00:02:45.930> they<00:02:46.260> put<00:02:46.470> up

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
keep walking and they put up

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.470 
keep walking and they put up
representations<00:02:47.459> of<00:02:47.580> what<00:02:47.760> buttons<00:02:48.150> to<00:02:48.209> push
