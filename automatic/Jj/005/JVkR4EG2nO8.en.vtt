well<00:00:01.380> this<00:00:01.530> is<00:00:01.790> for<00:00:02.790> those<00:00:02.909> who<00:00:03.060> wanted<00:00:03.270> to

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
well this is for those who wanted to

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.660 
well this is for those who wanted to
know<00:00:03.449> what<00:00:03.629> it<00:00:03.720> look<00:00:03.840> like<00:00:03.929> this<00:00:04.430> this<00:00:05.430> is<00:00:05.640> a

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
know what it look like this this is a

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.030 
know what it look like this this is a
voltmeter<00:00:06.299> I've<00:00:06.750> added<00:00:06.899> and<00:00:07.200> if<00:00:07.290> you<00:00:07.410> look<00:00:07.710> on

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
voltmeter I've added and if you look on

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.610 
voltmeter I've added and if you look on
the<00:00:08.460> 25<00:00:09.150> this<00:00:09.360> is<00:00:09.570> the<00:00:09.809> you<00:00:10.410> know<00:00:10.469> under

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
the 25 this is the you know under

well<00:00:21.810> I've<00:00:21.900> done<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.170> meter<00:00:22.380> itself<00:00:22.590> is<00:00:22.890> about

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
well I've done the meter itself is about

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.650 
well I've done the meter itself is about
seven<00:00:23.430> quid<00:00:23.670> and<00:00:24.240> it's<00:00:24.539> powered<00:00:24.960> by<00:00:25.310> the

battery<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.430> starter<00:01:38.880> battery<00:01:39.170> so<00:01:40.170> if<00:01:40.590> I

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
battery the starter battery so if I

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.730 
battery the starter battery so if I
switch<00:01:40.950> it<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.880> other<00:01:42.150> way<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:43.259> will<00:01:43.409> read

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
switch it to the other way it will read

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.020 
switch it to the other way it will read
the<00:01:44.030> voltage<00:01:45.030> on<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.270> cranking<00:01:45.630> battery<00:01:46.020> and

the voltage on the cranking battery and

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.190 
the voltage on the cranking battery and
the<00:01:48.030> great<00:01:48.240> thing<00:01:48.420> about<00:01:48.450> this<00:01:48.720> it<00:01:48.899> gives<00:01:48.990> you

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
the great thing about this it gives you

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.280 
the great thing about this it gives you
good<00:01:49.950> good<00:01:50.549> idea<00:01:51.000> of<00:01:51.149> whether<00:01:51.930> or<00:01:52.020> not<00:01:52.110> your

given point the voltage left in the
battery<00:01:58.530> which<00:01:58.770> is<00:01:58.799> great<00:01:59.130> if<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.340> camped

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
battery which is great if you camped

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.090 
battery which is great if you camped
overnight<00:01:59.960> right<00:02:00.960> oh<00:02:01.229> thank<00:02:01.710> you<00:02:01.770> very<00:02:01.920> much

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
overnight right oh thank you very much

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.130 
overnight right oh thank you very much
for<00:02:02.250> watching<00:02:02.670> there<00:02:02.939> was<00:02:03.060> some<00:02:03.420> painful<00:02:03.719> they

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
for watching there was some painful they

display and about 230 pound for the
switch<00:02:08.190> from<00:02:08.670> Oakland<00:02:09.149> but<00:02:09.539> fairly<00:02:09.840> easy<00:02:10.020> to

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
switch from Oakland but fairly easy to

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.819 
switch from Oakland but fairly easy to
worry<00:02:10.410> alright<00:02:11.009> thanks<00:02:11.430> for<00:02:11.459> watching
