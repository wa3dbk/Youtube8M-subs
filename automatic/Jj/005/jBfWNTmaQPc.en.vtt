00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
little spaceship here and you shoot the

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.760 
little spaceship here and you shoot the
enemy<00:00:34.710> spaceships<00:00:35.630> and<00:00:36.630> they<00:00:37.170> release<00:00:37.500> some

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
enemy spaceships and they release some

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.139 
enemy spaceships and they release some
kind<00:00:38.070> of<00:00:38.219> energy<00:00:39.149> thing<00:00:40.610> that<00:00:41.610> you<00:00:41.730> pick<00:00:41.940> up

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
kind of energy thing that you pick up

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.160 
kind of energy thing that you pick up
four<00:00:42.660> points<00:00:43.160> I<00:00:44.160> don't<00:00:44.910> know<00:00:45.090> what<00:00:45.510> it<00:00:45.780> enables

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
four points I don't know what it enables

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.500 
four points I don't know what it enables
you<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.620> do<00:00:46.920> if<00:00:47.100> anything<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:47.700> can<00:00:47.940> you

you to do if anything and you can you
can<00:00:48.690> destroy<00:00:49.050> it<00:00:49.110> as<00:00:49.260> well<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:49.620> looks<00:00:49.950> like

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
can destroy it as well it looks like

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.160 
can destroy it as well it looks like
that<00:00:50.520> you<00:00:50.820> fire<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.420> awesome<00:00:52.129> what<00:00:53.930> you've<00:00:54.930> no

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
that you fire to awesome what you've no

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.209 
that you fire to awesome what you've no
up<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.500> thing<00:00:55.710> that<00:00:55.829> you're<00:00:55.949> going<00:00:55.980> to

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
up the thing that you're going to

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.069 
up the thing that you're going to
capture<00:00:56.699> then<00:00:56.940> if<00:00:57.090> it's<00:00:57.239> like<00:00:57.300> their<00:00:57.600> energy

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
capture then if it's like their energy

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.260 
capture then if it's like their energy
core<00:00:58.440> out<00:00:58.649> of<00:00:58.800> their<00:00:58.980> ship<00:00:59.250> or<00:00:59.489> very<00:00:59.670> Star<00:00:59.969> Trek

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
core out of their ship or very Star Trek

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.090 
core out of their ship or very Star Trek
and<00:01:02.780> obviously<00:01:03.780> you've<00:01:04.049> got<00:01:04.229> that<00:01:04.409> star<00:01:04.739> in

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
and obviously you've got that star in

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.880 
and obviously you've got that star in
the<00:01:05.189> middle<00:01:05.460> you've<00:01:05.850> got<00:01:05.970> another<00:01:06.210> weapon<00:01:06.890> I'm

else that I don't oh yeah you got
teleport<00:01:16.310> that<00:01:17.310> was<00:01:17.490> not<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.939> button<00:01:18.210> hours

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
teleport that was not the button hours

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.870 
teleport that was not the button hours
after<00:01:19.080> their<00:01:19.950> does<00:01:20.159> a<00:01:20.189> bit<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.520> be<00:01:20.610> an<00:01:20.670> amount

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.940 
after their does a bit to be an amount
of<00:01:21.060> gravity<00:01:21.600> because<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.110> energy<00:01:22.229> calls<00:01:22.740> from

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
of gravity because the energy calls from

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.760 
of gravity because the energy calls from
these<00:01:23.130> ships<00:01:23.430> get<00:01:23.970> soaked<00:01:24.659> into<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.320> star<00:01:25.650> in

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
these ships get soaked into the star in

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.080 
these ships get soaked into the star in
the<00:01:25.830> middle<00:01:26.009> but<00:01:26.490> you've<00:01:26.610> got<00:01:26.759> this<00:01:26.880> other
