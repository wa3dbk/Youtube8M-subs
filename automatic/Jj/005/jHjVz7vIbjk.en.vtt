00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
viewing areas a 24 inch flat CRT so it's

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.990 
viewing areas a 24 inch flat CRT so it's
just<00:03:12.180> huge<00:03:12.720> and<00:03:13.100> it's<00:03:14.100> driven<00:03:14.370> directly<00:03:14.580> from

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
just huge and it's driven directly from

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.390 
just huge and it's driven directly from
the<00:03:15.150> g4<00:03:15.630> and<00:03:15.930> I<00:03:16.560> think<00:03:16.980> it's<00:03:17.130> you<00:03:17.310> know

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
the g4 and I think it's you know

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.530 
the g4 and I think it's you know
everybody<00:03:17.760> that's<00:03:17.970> seen<00:03:18.030> is<00:03:18.300> just

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
everybody that's seen is just

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.930 
everybody that's seen is just
jaw-dropping<00:03:18.890> in<00:03:19.890> terms<00:03:20.160> of<00:03:20.250> its<00:03:20.400> quality<00:03:20.910> and

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
jaw-dropping in terms of its quality and

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.000 
jaw-dropping in terms of its quality and
its<00:03:21.300> size<00:03:21.540> and<00:03:21.900> remember<00:03:22.739> this<00:03:22.830> whole

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
its size and remember this whole

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.390 
its size and remember this whole
displays<00:03:23.400> only<00:03:23.550> two<00:03:23.850> inches<00:03:24.150> thick<00:03:24.769> so<00:03:25.769> the

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
displays only two inches thick so the

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.830 
displays only two inches thick so the
way<00:03:26.550> we're<00:03:26.730> going<00:03:26.880> to<00:03:26.940> sell<00:03:27.209> these<00:03:27.330> initially

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
way we're going to sell these initially

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.840 
way we're going to sell these initially
since<00:03:28.050> they<00:03:28.200> will<00:03:28.410> be<00:03:28.620> in<00:03:28.800> limited<00:03:29.190> supply<00:03:29.340> is

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
since they will be in limited supply is

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.360 
since they will be in limited supply is

with one of the top two configurations

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.199 
with one of the top two configurations
of<00:03:34.320> a<00:03:34.410> g4<00:03:34.769> since<00:03:35.040> it<00:03:35.130> only<00:03:35.220> works<00:03:35.489> with<00:03:35.670> the<00:03:35.820> g4

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
of a g4 since it only works with the g4

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.600 
of a g4 since it only works with the g4
and<00:03:36.560> we'll<00:03:37.560> start<00:03:37.800> off<00:03:37.950> that<00:03:38.160> way<00:03:38.220> and<00:03:38.489> we'll

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
and we'll start off that way and we'll

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.720 
and we'll start off that way and we'll
see<00:03:38.790> as<00:03:39.180> supplies<00:03:39.900> ramp<00:03:40.260> up<00:03:40.470> we<00:03:40.950> may<00:03:41.160> we<00:03:41.700> may

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
see as supplies ramp up we may we may

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.100 
see as supplies ramp up we may we may
broaden<00:03:42.060> that<00:03:42.360> but<00:03:42.600> that's<00:03:42.750> how<00:03:42.870> we're
