00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.119
 subscribers yes but good 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:38.300

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.490
 I am going to teach you 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:49.190
 this texture pack is halo halo 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:51.940
 halo reach I think it's 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:56.500
 well then 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:58.600
 let's explain a little bit to see do not know 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.550
 wait a lot because this pack of 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.400
 textures and reduced I was the 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.460
 first I 've seen and 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:08.010
 this that is a piece of the ego is a 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.630
 piece of ego not the first time the 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.630
 I see beautiful and other 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.710
 good 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.430
 let's see 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:22.490
 first what I liked about this 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:25.909
 textures pack is that the armor is 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:28.630
 is normal of the gold but if I take 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:28.630
 the iron armor 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:37.030
 You can transform or have the 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.030
 armor 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:43.940
 the halo armor is and this is the 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.080
 normal and then there 's this one 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:49.350
 it's darker 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.409
 good with this 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.470
 What I liked most about this good country 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.869
 because some weapons you see here you have the 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.229
 sword with diamond sword but it 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.229
 supposes that 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.960
 for this textures pack do not know 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.360
 leave it because 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.770
 a correction up sword sword of 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.770
 sword of energy is called 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:22.620
 then in another thing they have put this weapon 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.620
 that works with frame 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:29.250
 and good stuff 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.960
 to this 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.960
 perfect this is kicking 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.550
 to 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:42.020
 good 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.020
 more things with more things 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.560
 entering had left 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:03:08.370
 and good out to sea to a mountain 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:10.350
 good what I do not like about this state 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.740
 it's not true it's not 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:16.040
 it's a normal minecraft not expected 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.040
 anything else 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.840
 you see how the grass is 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:25.580
 and the trees 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:28.880
 the enemies good if also a little bit 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:32.330
 but for example I have shown you another 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:35.980

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:39.069

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:42.629
