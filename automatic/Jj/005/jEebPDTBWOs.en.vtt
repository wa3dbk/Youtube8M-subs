00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 that was really a great experience 

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:06.660
 to beat this top team with 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.599
 we have our top team yesterday 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.150
 really great played exactly what 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.290
 we actually set ourselves and 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.660
 I am very proud of the whole 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.830
 Team on the whole city really 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.840
 the support was outstanding and yes 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.600
 I'm just happy in now 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.210
 this moment that we have the three points 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.250
 could have let here at the latest 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.740
 after 1 1 the team noticed 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.800
 that something is possible or a gate like that 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.390
 bit the initial ignition 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.670
 we had in the first few minutes 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.520
 they were very playful 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.320
 but have made with passion and 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.370
 fight but more and more found in the game 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.410
 and then happy still the 2 1 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.430
 the always so beautiful moments we do 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.000
 unfortunately too fast in the 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:57.329
 moment 2 1 winner in the situation 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:02.190
 at home against german champions and im 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:03.719
 relegation battle that is a moment in the 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.100
 not week yet with the grandson 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.210
 then the class can refine in class 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.890
 Of course it is even more important and important 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.880
 so much the better and you can do it 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.340
 in a time maybe a little 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.560
 eighth hit the season 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.880
 eleventh assignment as an explanation for the 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.799
 Run as good as I said 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.880
 Striker by 1 through and try 16er 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.340
 to find my position that is 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.990
 someone then creates change if so 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.729
 player like him yesterday at the install of 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.290
 Karim and before that the weeks in one 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.140
 later then, the easiest for me is 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.759
 then help with it too 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.140
 but to recycle these things and for that 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.240
 I've been brought in and now and then a lot 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.460
 well and now there is still a game where is 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.030
 again, hopefully again 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.619
 can handle 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.810
 Last week was a victory against the 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.420
 German master what is this two too 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.470
 one in the fight for relegation has 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.810
 if you now in retrospect the 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.520
 results attracts something like the others 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.220
 teams have played something tremendous 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.810
 important that I have three points here 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.439
 not only got a point but 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.460
 three points that is in the fight for relegation 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:00.750
 Generally very important that we really 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.570
 Collect as many points as possible 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.520
 Now we have another game and we 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.170
 give as well 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.170
 to get everything there by three points
