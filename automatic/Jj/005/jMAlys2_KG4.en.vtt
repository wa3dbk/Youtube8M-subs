your<00:00:54.149> defi<00:00:54.840> defy+<00:00:55.649> are<00:00:56.039> bricked<00:00:56.309> so<00:00:57.120> if<00:00:57.600> we<00:00:57.930> go

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
your defi defy+ are bricked so if we go

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:05.750 
your defi defy+ are bricked so if we go
into<00:00:58.410> that<00:01:02.809> ok<00:01:03.809> so<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:04.530> couple<00:01:05.159> of<00:01:05.430> things<00:01:05.549> to

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
into that ok so a couple of things to

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.640 
into that ok so a couple of things to
download<00:01:06.090> from<00:01:06.210> he<00:01:06.390> is<00:01:06.420> obviously<00:01:06.689> you<00:01:07.350> need

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
download from he is obviously you need

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.730 
download from he is obviously you need
the<00:01:08.030> Motorola<00:01:09.030> USB<00:01:09.540> driver<00:01:09.780> so<00:01:10.140> make<00:01:10.710> sure

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740

it's<00:02:44.330> called<00:02:44.660> routing<00:02:45.050> defy<00:02:45.950> or<00:02:46.010> defy+<00:02:46.700> so

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
it's called routing defy or defy+ so

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.920 
it's called routing defy or defy+ so
from<00:02:48.230> this<00:02:48.470> one<00:02:48.680> you'll<00:02:49.550> see<00:02:49.760> it's<00:02:49.930> it's

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
package file for Android so it's pretty

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.140 
package file for Android so it's pretty
straightforward<00:04:29.539> we<00:04:29.900> just<00:04:30.050> copied<00:04:30.349> onto<00:04:30.500> the

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
straightforward we just copied onto the

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.999 
straightforward we just copied onto the
root<00:04:32.150> of<00:04:32.270> the<00:04:32.360> SD<00:04:32.599> and<00:04:32.629> install<00:04:33.139> it<00:04:33.319> but<00:04:33.860> we'll

00:04:33.999 --> 00:04:34.009 
root of the SD and install it but we'll

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:36.070 
root of the SD and install it but we'll
go<00:04:34.190> through<00:04:34.430> that<00:04:34.490> in<00:04:34.849> a<00:04:35.629> second

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
go through that in a second

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.439 
go through that in a second
so<00:04:36.879> okay<00:04:37.879> now<00:04:38.060> we<00:04:38.120> can<00:04:38.449> go<00:04:38.900> back<00:04:39.080> to<00:04:39.110> defy<00:04:39.560> and

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:40.449 
so okay now we can go back to defy and

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:43.960 
so okay now we can go back to defy and
if<00:04:41.449> you<00:04:41.629> already<00:04:42.080> haven't<00:04:42.379> done<00:04:42.710> so<00:04:42.949> go<00:04:43.400> into

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
if you already haven't done so go into

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:49.390 
if you already haven't done so go into
Android<00:04:44.780> development<00:04:47.440> as<00:04:48.440> always<00:04:48.919> go<00:04:49.220> through

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
Android development as always go through

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.450 
Android development as always go through
and<00:04:49.610> read<00:04:49.879> we'd<00:04:50.180> read<00:04:50.650> in<00:04:51.650> this<00:04:51.860> sin<00:04:52.099> hour<00:04:52.250> in

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
and read we'd read in this sin hour in

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.010 
and read we'd read in this sin hour in
this<00:04:52.550> case<00:04:52.789> I'm<00:04:53.030> actually<00:04:53.180> gonna<00:04:53.419> go<00:04:53.659> and
