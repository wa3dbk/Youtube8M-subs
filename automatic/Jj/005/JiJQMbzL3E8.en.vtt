00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.310
 or continue with the games 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:07.500
 features of the year so individual 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:10.200
 segments share a game that the 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.580
 all over the norm around in too 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.320
 this list is a few titles 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.519
 which probably without these individual 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.619
 Small ideas probably more 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.420
 mediocrity would have been premier 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.539
 I have the coolest games ideas 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.359
 respectively game features 2014 one 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:29.010
 system creative direction swisscor june 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.210
 according to space I have actually a 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.489
 considered while if I clean it here 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.770
 should take the nes-system from 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.930
 Although shadows of motor is actually 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.420
 very cool thing but it comes in the game 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.360
 way too late to wear the cool idea 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.309
 behind it is namely that all orks in 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.200
 the game that meets their killings 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.510
 somehow linked together 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.730
 they are led by the leaders 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.620
 in turn, from higher mightier orcs 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.149
 be led and you can then for 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.489
 chaos in rows worry by her 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.920
 targeted this leader turns off and 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.090
 you up in the ranks that works 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.260
 Clever is that it is in both 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.090
 pages works when he speaks 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.070
 to be killed by a hurricane leader 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.960
 then he gets promoted what then 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.119
 leads that he gets stronger all over 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.979
 rows shift that had one 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.990
 very clever component as I said the 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.970
 in the game unfortunately only late for 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.409
 Wear comes because because again 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.110
 you get a new feature 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.790
 then you can use your own orks 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.070
 you with mind control 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.259
 force for your concerns to fight 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.420
 the name system will be correct 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.220
 cool that he is only in the 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.020
 last third of the game really 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.240
 important nevertheless it is name system 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.890
 cool idea in a possible 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.360
 second shadows of murder then 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.759
 maybe be developed properly 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.590
 could therefore be a worthy place 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.590
 five for this list 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.189
 fourth place 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.299
 I just have to award this 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.549
 only for the noise that happens 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:02:00.610
 If the title reports this feeling 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:04.689
 this that comforting rushing in the belly 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:06.100
 if it does then again that is 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:08.110
 an incredibly satisfying thing 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.000
 if you have enough points around 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.739
 to get down from the orientated 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.090
 heaven and then you 'll crash and you know 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.380
 so now I get in there and now 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.819
 is it good to turn it off properly 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.739
 friend is unfortunately not the hoped for 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.269
 it became relatively successful 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.069
 sold well at the beginning though 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:23.019
 meanwhile you still know someone else 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:25.630
 playing this game that was a giant 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:27.489
 hype to start but is now 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.380
 somehow relatively in the sunken 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.209
 disappeared, unfortunately, has not 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.470
 really paid off for ea's see 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.510
 if there is a second part of it 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.790
 will definitely be the fact that 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.660
 your max from the sky to the floor 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.610
 strike 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.489
 so cool it has this year 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:47.670
 not to feel a special ability 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:47.670
 I found third place 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.710
 Sunset overdrive is also a title 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.150
 he was not really good 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:58.760
 The thing is gone 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.950
 short fun but not controls 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.470
 as clean as it would have to happen 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.720
 but has very many cool and 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.090
 funny ideas the best as I think 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.280
 are the respawn animations in the game 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.090
 he dies relatively often but 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.160
 you will not be easy then 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.050
 reset to a respawn point 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.180
 but it is always with one 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.700
 different animation initiated 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.340
 the total of 18 in number, the 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.930
 all small pop culture references and 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.300
 Quotes are then you become man of 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.250
 dropped off a ufo or you come along 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.860
 a time machine as in doctor who 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.290
 or many other small ones 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.180
 on big movie classics or comics 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.770
 very very cool idea as I think the 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.640
 this game also with the over the 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.640
 mediocre elevates 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.170
 second place 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.909
 in the second sun was above all things 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.409
 my graphics card of the year now 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:55.629
 maybe next to assassin's 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:57.879
 creed unity which is why so much 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:59.440
 has fun because the neon forces 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:01.269
 or these smoke forces 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.310
 at all the special forces you in the 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:04.900
 could use the game properly 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.340
 let it be really fat it was 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.690
 yes in the predecessors really cool 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.670
 with the lightning and such 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.840
 play around but now it is 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.220
 not only very nice in the game world 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.480
 one also because that's playful 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.190
 for the boss fight from time to time 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.139
 becomes relevant again which forces you 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.699
 because now pulls out of the environment but 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:20.470
 looks just too damn horny 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:22.389
 if you are with the new forces 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:25.150
 anderland runs around or with the 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:27.130
 smokestack around derived or with 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.080
 stones through the area I pull 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.060
 think that's very cool, I think so 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.740
 yes even by dlc paper 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.750
 But I never have any power in action 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.570
 I found somehow I found one 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.310
 very easy casual idea about the 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.990
 enhance game in audio visual 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.530
 outlook and what the coolness factor 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.530
 As for 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.370
 place one 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.870
 is this game out space one 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.250
 choose one of my lists again 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.750
 I would not have thought so too 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.449
 even had me in a last one 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.710
 Release 6 baulks the new world of 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:04:59.880
 to play warcraft now i have it 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.770
 but done and I could not anymore 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.630
 get rid of it all because of the 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.820
 new figurehead you have now 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:07.199
 finally the housing being so real 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.820
 housing it is not who once 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:10.979
 Ultima has played online knows how 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.870
 Real housing can work wherever you are 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:15.570
 even the little jugs from which you 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:18.150
 your own wine drinks finished 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.440
 but could it still makes fun because 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.449
 on the one hand, it has everything 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.550
 one year browsergame effect where you 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:25.740
 Followers then educate you 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:27.599
 Send emissions can so again 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.130
 such a little Japanese pokÃ©mon-like 

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:30.449
 Although trains do not accept as in the house 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:32.130
 the fight but you can fight these 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:33.990
 equip and they have different 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.220
 special skills etc 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.720
 and you can too, for example 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.400
 Build your own building then where to go 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.740
 example also learned blacksmithing or 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.090
 Herbs break down though you have these trades 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.759
 maybe not even learned 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:47.490
 have that is super cool and add that 

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:49.680
 do not add a component to this 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:53.250
 only enriched but actually over 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:54.960
 The last addons therefore charge for 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:56.699
 me the feature of the year alone 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.620
 because I have so much time already 

00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:00.840
 I've spent so and now tell me 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:03.389
 what are your games features yours 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:05.190
 There were individual games ideas of the year 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:07.169
 there might be a weapon or a weapon 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:08.880
 mode that you have especially celebrated here 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:10.620
 then like to come in below and now in the 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:14.570
 next days you look forward to the best 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:14.570
 games and films of the year 2014
