00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
they get hot right and they do tend to I

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.890 
they get hot right and they do tend to I
mean<00:02:15.900> if<00:02:16.020> it<00:02:16.170> melts<00:02:16.470> and<00:02:16.620> shuts<00:02:16.830> a<00:02:16.950> hole<00:02:17.900> right

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
mean if it melts and shuts a hole right

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.440 
mean if it melts and shuts a hole right
so<00:02:19.590> is<00:02:19.890> that<00:02:19.950> something<00:02:20.490> that<00:02:20.670> is<00:02:21.060> something

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
so is that something that is something

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.420 
so is that something that is something

would<00:03:26.040> go<00:03:26.220> back<00:03:26.400> into<00:03:26.580> the<00:03:26.730> silage<00:03:27.090> that<00:03:27.300> we'd

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
would go back into the silage that we'd

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.080 
would go back into the silage that we'd
recommend<00:03:27.810> you'd<00:03:28.350> now<00:03:28.560> use<00:03:28.980> it<00:03:29.220> you<00:03:29.730> may<00:03:29.880> okay

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.060 
recommend you'd now use it you may okay
I<00:03:30.390> won't<00:03:30.930> bother<00:03:31.110> filming<00:03:31.590> this<00:03:31.680> bit<00:03:31.920> which

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
I won't bother filming this bit which

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:33.949 
I won't bother filming this bit which
would<00:03:32.580> do<00:03:32.730> I<00:03:32.910> think<00:03:33.030> we<00:03:33.239> got<00:03:33.360> this<00:03:33.450> separately

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
would do I think we got this separately

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.300 
would do I think we got this separately
but<00:03:34.140> basically<00:03:34.590> you'd<00:03:34.830> use<00:03:35.010> your<00:03:35.070> milk

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
but basically you'd use your milk

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.600 
but basically you'd use your milk
cleaner<00:03:35.610> you<00:03:36.330> throw<00:03:36.830> milk<00:03:37.830> clean<00:03:38.070> and<00:03:38.340> then<00:03:38.489> do

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
cleaner you throw milk clean and then do

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.570 
cleaner you throw milk clean and then do
a<00:03:38.670> separate<00:03:39.030> one<00:03:39.180> for<00:03:39.480> the<00:03:40.380> rinse<00:03:41.040> afterwards

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
a separate one for the rinse afterwards

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.040 
a separate one for the rinse afterwards
which<00:03:41.730> I<00:03:41.880> think<00:03:42.090> we've<00:03:42.209> got<00:03:42.330> on<00:03:42.420> another<00:03:42.510> film

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
which I think we've got on another film

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.229 
which I think we've got on another film
but<00:03:43.890> that<00:03:43.920> is<00:03:44.160> how<00:03:44.340> he<00:03:44.400> should<00:03:44.519> be<00:03:44.790> done<00:03:45.000> and

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
but that is how he should be done and

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:48.410 
but that is how he should be done and
stripped<00:03:45.959> down<00:03:46.019> completely
