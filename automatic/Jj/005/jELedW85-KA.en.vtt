and the way you see the Lightning pop
out<00:05:53.790> but<00:05:54.270> here's<00:05:54.450> the<00:05:54.600> big<00:05:54.720> thing<00:05:54.750> I<00:05:54.960> noticed

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:55.350 
out but here's the big thing I noticed

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:56.990 
out but here's the big thing I noticed
with<00:05:55.470> that<00:05:55.680> move<00:05:55.950> that<00:05:56.160> was<00:05:56.340> introduced<00:05:56.790> with

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 
with that move that was introduced with

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.480 
with that move that was introduced with
Lily<00:05:57.240> Oreo<00:05:57.570> at<00:05:58.080> the<00:05:58.290> ending<00:05:58.950> of<00:05:59.070> the<00:05:59.160> episode

00:05:59.480 --> 00:05:59.490 
Lily Oreo at the ending of the episode

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:00.620 
Lily Oreo at the ending of the episode
when<00:05:59.580> you<00:05:59.640> save<00:05:59.790> activate<00:06:00.240> you<00:06:00.330> see<00:06:00.480> like

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:00.630 
when you save activate you see like

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:02.060 
when you save activate you see like
there's<00:06:00.780> a<00:06:00.810> lot<00:06:00.990> of<00:06:01.110> strike<00:06:01.380> of<00:06:01.530> light<00:06:01.710> and<00:06:01.950> go

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:02.070 
there's a lot of strike of light and go

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.190 
there's a lot of strike of light and go
from<00:06:02.280> him<00:06:02.520> to<00:06:02.760> where<00:06:03.090> you<00:06:03.300> know<00:06:03.450> Jean<00:06:04.020> was

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:04.200 
from him to where you know Jean was

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.200 
from him to where you know Jean was
sitting<00:06:04.650> at<00:06:04.770> so<00:06:05.070> I'm<00:06:05.280> guessing<00:06:05.730> wherever<00:06:06.060> that

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:06.210 
sitting at so I'm guessing wherever that

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:07.880 
sitting at so I'm guessing wherever that
strike<00:06:06.510> lightning<00:06:06.810> goes<00:06:07.200> or<00:06:07.440> whatever<00:06:07.710> that

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:07.890 
strike lightning goes or whatever that

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:10.640 
strike lightning goes or whatever that
was<00:06:08.130> when<00:06:08.700> it<00:06:08.820> gets<00:06:09.090> there<00:06:09.330> that's<00:06:10.080> where<00:06:10.440> you

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:10.650 
was when it gets there that's where you

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:11.960 
was when it gets there that's where you
know<00:06:10.740> his<00:06:10.920> fists<00:06:11.190> will<00:06:11.340> come<00:06:11.460> out<00:06:11.580> so<00:06:11.760> it's<00:06:11.880> a

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:11.970 
know his fists will come out so it's a

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:14.360 
know his fists will come out so it's a
really<00:06:12.210> easy<00:06:12.420> move<00:06:13.110> to<00:06:13.410> dodge<00:06:13.680> it<00:06:14.010> seems<00:06:14.220> like

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:14.370 
really easy move to dodge it seems like

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:16.160 
really easy move to dodge it seems like
if<00:06:14.550> you<00:06:14.640> know<00:06:14.850> exactly<00:06:15.150> how<00:06:15.780> this<00:06:15.930> ability

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:16.170 
if you know exactly how this ability

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:17.840 
if you know exactly how this ability
works<00:06:16.470> because<00:06:16.800> if<00:06:16.950> that's<00:06:17.070> how<00:06:17.340> it<00:06:17.460> works

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:17.850 
works because if that's how it works

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:19.310 
works because if that's how it works
and<00:06:17.940> that's<00:06:18.330> where<00:06:18.570> the<00:06:18.690> point<00:06:18.930> of<00:06:19.170> that

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:19.320 
and that's where the point of that

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.140 
and that's where the point of that
electric<00:06:19.770> or<00:06:19.890> lightning<00:06:20.220> or<00:06:20.310> then<00:06:20.490> stops<00:06:20.850> at

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:21.150 
electric or lightning or then stops at

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.750 
electric or lightning or then stops at
then<00:06:21.780> it'll<00:06:21.990> pop<00:06:22.200> out<00:06:22.410> then<00:06:22.830> really<00:06:23.550> I<00:06:23.580> don't

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:23.760 
then it'll pop out then really I don't

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.880 
then it'll pop out then really I don't
think<00:06:23.970> anyone<00:06:24.660> has<00:06:24.930> to<00:06:25.080> war<00:06:25.260> I<00:06:25.290> think<00:06:25.680> Jean

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:25.890 
think anyone has to war I think Jean

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:28.130 
think anyone has to war I think Jean
just<00:06:26.130> got<00:06:26.340> surprised<00:06:26.820> by<00:06:27.090> the<00:06:27.150> ability<00:06:27.660> but<00:06:28.080> I

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:28.140 
just got surprised by the ability but I

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:30.020 
just got surprised by the ability but I
highly<00:06:28.440> doubt<00:06:28.740> he's<00:06:28.800> hurt<00:06:29.250> because<00:06:29.580> this<00:06:29.820> dude
