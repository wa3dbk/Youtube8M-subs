00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:06.820 

I<00:00:04.280> first<00:00:05.120> got<00:00:05.300> the<00:00:05.450> Rochester<00:00:05.960> I<00:00:06.200> really<00:00:06.740> was

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:06.830 
I first got the Rochester I really was

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:08.200 
I first got the Rochester I really was
trying<00:00:06.980> to<00:00:07.100> decide<00:00:07.400> between<00:00:07.520> mechanical

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:08.210 
trying to decide between mechanical

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:09.640 
trying to decide between mechanical
engineering<00:00:08.540> and<00:00:08.750> chemical<00:00:08.990> engineering<00:00:09.170> and

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:09.650 
engineering and chemical engineering and

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.160 
engineering and chemical engineering and
when<00:00:10.070> I<00:00:10.100> read<00:00:10.820> about<00:00:10.940> the<00:00:11.210> be<00:00:11.420> me<00:00:11.630> department

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:12.170 
when I read about the be me department

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.379 
when I read about the be me department
here<00:00:12.500> it<00:00:13.129> was<00:00:13.340> kind<00:00:13.610> of<00:00:13.639> the<00:00:13.730> perfect<00:00:13.879> mix<00:00:14.240> it

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:14.389 
here it was kind of the perfect mix it

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:16.060 
here it was kind of the perfect mix it
allowed<00:00:14.660> me<00:00:14.840> to<00:00:14.869> get<00:00:15.139> hands-on<00:00:15.680> experience

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:16.070 
allowed me to get hands-on experience

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.359 
allowed me to get hands-on experience
while<00:00:16.880> applying<00:00:17.300> scientific<00:00:18.020> concepts<00:00:18.530> to

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:19.369 
while applying scientific concepts to

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:22.600 
while applying scientific concepts to
the<00:00:19.670> body<00:00:20.560> main<00:00:21.560> computer<00:00:22.010> science<00:00:22.370> were

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:22.610 
the body main computer science were

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.090 
the body main computer science were
really<00:00:23.180> about<00:00:23.510> solving<00:00:24.470> really<00:00:24.800> hard

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:25.100 
really about solving really hard

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.190 
really about solving really hard
real-world<00:00:25.700> problems<00:00:26.210> efficiently<00:00:26.780> it's

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:27.200 
real-world problems efficiently it's

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.440 
real-world problems efficiently it's
always<00:00:27.440> been<00:00:27.560> really<00:00:27.800> cool<00:00:28.040> to<00:00:28.160> me<00:00:28.310> that<00:00:28.520> even

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:29.450 
always been really cool to me that even

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:30.700 
always been really cool to me that even
when<00:00:29.570> you're<00:00:29.660> working<00:00:29.930> with<00:00:29.960> computers<00:00:30.560> the

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:30.710 
when you're working with computers the

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.619 
when you're working with computers the
end<00:00:30.860> result<00:00:31.250> once<00:00:31.580> you<00:00:31.730> have<00:00:31.940> programmed

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:32.629 
end result once you have programmed

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:35.380 
end result once you have programmed
something<00:00:33.050> is<00:00:33.170> so<00:00:33.379> tangible

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
something is so tangible

Rochester has been great the main thing
that<00:00:39.289> attracted<00:00:39.829> me<00:00:39.920> to<00:00:40.039> the<00:00:40.129> University<00:00:40.159> and

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
that attracted me to the University and

the thing that I still love about it is
the<00:00:42.920> freedom<00:00:43.219> of<00:00:43.640> the<00:00:43.969> course<00:00:44.239> though<00:00:44.449> even<00:00:44.719> as

00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:44.899 
the freedom of the course though even as

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:46.899 
the freedom of the course though even as
an<00:00:45.019> engineer<00:00:45.409> you<00:00:45.440> get<00:00:45.829> to<00:00:46.010> take<00:00:46.250> courses<00:00:46.760> that

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:46.909 
an engineer you get to take courses that

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:47.860 
an engineer you get to take courses that
you're<00:00:47.089> interested<00:00:47.390> in

research<00:02:03.800> so<00:02:04.250> we<00:02:04.340> have<00:02:04.489> a<00:02:04.670> lot<00:02:04.849> of<00:02:04.879> projects

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
research so we have a lot of projects

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.169 
research so we have a lot of projects
that<00:02:05.989> cross<00:02:06.349> disciplinary<00:02:07.250> boundaries<00:02:07.700> that

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
that cross disciplinary boundaries that

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.470 
that cross disciplinary boundaries that
was<00:02:08.269> more<00:02:08.450> interested<00:02:08.899> in<00:02:09.789> just<00:02:10.789> any<00:02:10.940> project

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
was more interested in just any project

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.869 
was more interested in just any project
that<00:02:11.540> was<00:02:11.780> not<00:02:12.110> classroom<00:02:12.860> environment<00:02:13.519> in

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:13.879 
that was not classroom environment in

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:15.369 
that was not classroom environment in

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:15.379 
order to compete in Baja you have to

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:16.899 
order to compete in Baja you have to
build<00:02:15.530> a<00:02:15.650> race<00:02:15.800> car<00:02:16.040> from<00:02:16.220> scratch<00:02:16.489> so

00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:16.909 
build a race car from scratch so

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:18.640 
build a race car from scratch so
anywhere<00:02:17.239> from<00:02:17.450> the<00:02:17.569> design<00:02:17.840> process<00:02:18.379> to<00:02:18.409> the

anywhere from the design process to the
building<00:02:18.950> process<00:02:19.159> it's<00:02:20.150> basically<00:02:20.569> all<00:02:20.810> the

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
building process it's basically all the
