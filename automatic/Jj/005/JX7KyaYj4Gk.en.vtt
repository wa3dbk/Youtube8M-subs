00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
so we're just barely writing the car at

so we're just barely writing the car at
low<00:00:20.730> speed<00:00:21.060> first

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:29.540 
car still just a little quick we're just

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.470 
car still just a little quick we're just
in<00:00:29.660> the<00:00:29.720> middle<00:00:29.780> of<00:00:30.020> the<00:00:30.080> evaluation<00:00:31.480> we're

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
in the middle of the evaluation we're

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.900 
in the middle of the evaluation we're
not<00:00:32.599> quite<00:00:32.810> finished<00:00:32.840> the<00:00:33.290> BMW<00:00:33.860> 3-series<00:00:34.550> here

and<00:00:35.350> we<00:00:36.350> still<00:00:36.560> have<00:00:36.680> so<00:00:36.830> many<00:00:36.950> programs<00:00:37.370> to

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
and we still have so many programs to

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.600 
and we still have so many programs to
make<00:00:38.230> just<00:00:39.230> at<00:00:39.380> low<00:00:39.500> speed<00:00:39.830> the<00:00:39.980> cars<00:00:40.220> just<00:00:40.460> a

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
make just at low speed the cars just a

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.210 
make just at low speed the cars just a
little<00:00:41.000> bit<00:00:41.180> strong<00:00:41.480> but<00:00:41.750> I<00:00:42.620> get<00:00:42.800> a<00:00:42.830> little<00:00:43.010> bit

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:43.220

little bit strong but I get a little bit
more

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.040 
though it's a nice rubbery feel it's not
harsh<00:00:59.140> at<00:00:59.290> all<00:00:59.850> as<00:01:00.850> we<00:01:01.120> build<00:01:01.330> speed<00:01:01.750> and

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.050 
harsh at all as we build speed and

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.850 
harsh at all as we build speed and
energy<00:01:02.650> into<00:01:03.070> the<00:01:03.220> car

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860

the<00:01:05.340> right<00:01:05.520> quality<00:01:06.000> is<00:01:06.060> improving<00:01:06.710> to<00:01:07.710> the

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:07.800 
the right quality is improving to the

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.280 
the right quality is improving to the
low<00:01:07.950> speech<00:01:08.310> I'd<00:01:08.550> like<00:01:08.730> to<00:01:09.020> make<00:01:10.020> some<00:01:10.170> more

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
low speech I'd like to make some more

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.530 
low speech I'd like to make some more
improvements<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.580> offset<00:01:12.030> of<00:01:12.060> steering

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
improvements the offset of steering

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.500 
improvements the offset of steering
response<00:01:12.690> is<00:01:13.140> just<00:01:13.440> wonderful<00:01:14.330> really<00:01:15.330> good

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:15.510 
response is just wonderful really good

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.470 
response is just wonderful really good
feeling<00:01:15.780> of<00:01:16.020> connection<00:01:17.180> and<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.300> role

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:18.480 
feeling of connection and the role

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.240 
feeling of connection and the role
phasing<00:01:18.990> which<00:01:19.620> I've<00:01:19.800> mentioned<00:01:19.830> the

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
phasing which I've mentioned the

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.480 
phasing which I've mentioned the
forefront<00:01:20.670> area<00:01:21.060> is<00:01:21.660> really<00:01:21.960> well<00:01:22.320> time<00:01:22.590> so<00:01:23.430> it

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
forefront area is really well time so it

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.219 
forefront area is really well time so it
feels<00:01:23.610> like<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.970> car<00:01:24.180> is<00:01:24.360> really<00:01:24.690> acting<00:01:24.960> as

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
feels like the car is really acting as

one

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.540 

about<00:01:33.510> 80<00:01:33.690> kilometres<00:01:34.260> an<00:01:34.350> hour<00:01:34.470> and<00:01:34.830> the

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
about 80 kilometres an hour and the

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.210 
about 80 kilometres an hour and the
verticals<00:01:36.180> from<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.600> rear<00:01:36.870> I've<00:01:37.770> just<00:01:37.830> so<00:01:38.190> a

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
verticals from the rear I've just so a

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.650 
verticals from the rear I've just so a
little<00:01:38.430> bit<00:01:38.610> quick<00:01:38.940> I'm<00:01:39.180> getting<00:01:39.420> some

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:39.660 
little bit quick I'm getting some

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.080 
little bit quick I'm getting some
acceleration<00:01:40.200> in<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.590> safe<00:01:40.830> so<00:01:41.670> I'd<00:01:41.790> like<00:01:41.940> to

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
acceleration in the safe so I'd like to

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.780 
acceleration in the safe so I'd like to
slow<00:01:42.330> that<00:01:42.510> down<00:01:42.740> our<00:01:43.740> adjustable<00:01:44.220> damper<00:01:44.640> has

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
slow that down our adjustable damper has

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.670 
slow that down our adjustable damper has
the<00:01:44.970> ability<00:01:45.360> on<00:01:45.480> force<00:01:45.780> off<00:01:46.050> to<00:01:46.230> give<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.380> very

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
the ability on force off to give a very

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.910 
the ability on force off to give a very
good<00:01:46.830> luxury<00:01:47.340> ride<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:48.510> I'm

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
you know through the adjustment setting

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:52.749 
you know through the adjustment setting
you<00:01:51.200> increase<00:01:51.560> the<00:01:51.740> damping<00:01:52.159> and<00:01:52.280> the<00:01:52.580> car

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
you increase the damping and the car

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:55.690 
you increase the damping and the car
gets<00:01:52.970> more<00:01:53.210> reactive<00:01:53.659> but<00:01:54.470> unforced<00:01:54.979> soft<00:01:55.189> I'd

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
gets more reactive but unforced soft I'd

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.870 
gets more reactive but unforced soft I'd
like<00:01:55.939> it<00:01:56.090> a<00:01:56.150> little<00:01:56.299> bit<00:01:56.540> more<00:02:00.430> well<00:02:01.430> what<00:02:01.850> I

just<00:03:07.700> put<00:03:07.909> in<00:03:08.030> our<00:03:08.180> first<00:03:09.040> listening

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
just put in our first listening

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.089 
just put in our first listening
prototype<00:03:10.819> down<00:03:11.030> into<00:03:11.450> the<00:03:11.540> car<00:03:11.720> and<00:03:12.079> doing<00:03:13.010> an

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:13.099 
prototype down into the car and doing an

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:15.729 
prototype down into the car and doing an
evaluation<00:03:14.110> seeing<00:03:15.110> what<00:03:15.230> the<00:03:15.290> cars<00:03:15.470> like

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
evaluation seeing what the cars like

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:17.740 
evaluation seeing what the cars like
because<00:03:16.099> it<00:03:16.220> really<00:03:16.430> did<00:03:16.760> Sid<00:03:17.090> need<00:03:17.329> some<00:03:17.540> help

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
because it really did Sid need some help

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.619 
because it really did Sid need some help
with<00:03:17.959> the<00:03:18.110> the<00:03:18.500> roll<00:03:18.680> control<00:03:19.000> while<00:03:20.000> I

00:03:20.619 --> 00:03:20.629 
with the the roll control while I

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:22.869 
with the the roll control while I
underberg<00:03:21.500> were<00:03:21.769> very<00:03:22.010> good<00:03:22.159> with<00:03:22.220> the<00:03:22.489> ride

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:22.879 
underberg were very good with the ride

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:26.259 
underberg were very good with the ride
comfort<00:03:23.299> I<00:03:23.569> think<00:03:24.110> it<00:03:24.230> really<00:03:24.409> was<00:03:25.400> a<00:03:25.700> little

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
comfort I think it really was a little

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:28.599 
comfort I think it really was a little
unstable<00:03:26.650> in<00:03:27.650> some<00:03:27.890> of<00:03:27.980> the<00:03:28.040> areas<00:03:28.069> with<00:03:28.579> the

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:28.609 
unstable in some of the areas with the

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:32.020 
unstable in some of the areas with the
roll<00:03:29.200> so<00:03:30.200> even<00:03:30.470> now<00:03:30.650> with<00:03:30.980> the<00:03:31.040> first<00:03:31.400> with<00:03:31.940> the

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
roll so even now with the first with the

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.420 
roll so even now with the first with the
first<00:03:32.239> tuning<00:03:32.599> in<00:03:32.690> the<00:03:32.780> car<00:03:33.019> the<00:03:33.859> car<00:03:34.069> is<00:03:34.099> much

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
first tuning in the car the car is much

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:35.740 
first tuning in the car the car is much
better<00:03:34.730> than<00:03:34.790> the<00:03:34.970> offset<00:03:35.329> at<00:03:35.480> steering

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
better than the offset at steering

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.780 
better than the offset at steering
response<00:03:36.069> so<00:03:37.069> I'm<00:03:37.129> feeling<00:03:37.280> much<00:03:37.579> more

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
response so I'm feeling much more

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.690 
response so I'm feeling much more
connection<00:03:38.239> with<00:03:38.359> the<00:03:38.420> road<00:03:38.599> surface<00:03:38.840> I<00:03:39.700> think

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
connection with the road surface I think

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.630 
connection with the road surface I think
the<00:03:41.480> ride<00:03:41.720> maybe<00:03:42.440> a<00:03:42.560> little<00:03:42.799> bit<00:03:43.040> strong<00:03:43.400> and

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
the ride maybe a little bit strong and

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.059 
the ride maybe a little bit strong and
similar<00:03:44.359> to<00:03:44.480> the<00:03:44.569> BMW<00:03:45.140> that<00:03:45.799> we're<00:03:45.980> getting

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069 
similar to the BMW that we're getting

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:47.559 
similar to the BMW that we're getting
pumped<00:03:46.549> around<00:03:46.640> a<00:03:46.879> little<00:03:47.000> bit<00:03:47.150> in<00:03:47.269> the<00:03:47.359> seat

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:47.569 
pumped around a little bit in the seat

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:50.710 
pumped around a little bit in the seat
so<00:03:47.900> that's<00:03:48.799> quite<00:03:49.010> easy<00:03:49.190> to<00:03:49.310> fix<00:03:49.579> with<00:03:50.540> the

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
so that's quite easy to fix with the

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.460 
so that's quite easy to fix with the
answer<00:03:51.230> distant<00:03:52.269> so<00:03:53.269> we'll<00:03:53.480> look<00:03:53.900> at<00:03:54.109> working

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
answer distant so we'll look at working

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.069 
answer distant so we'll look at working
on<00:03:54.590> this<00:03:54.849> also<00:03:55.849> a<00:03:56.030> little<00:03:56.239> bit<00:03:56.329> loose<00:03:56.659> with<00:03:57.049> the

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:57.079 
on this also a little bit loose with the

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:01.180 
on this also a little bit loose with the
wheel<00:03:57.319> control<00:03:57.880> but<00:03:59.109> the<00:04:00.109> tuning<00:04:00.470> ability<00:04:00.889> of

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
wheel control but the tuning ability of

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:07.309 
wheel control but the tuning ability of
our<00:04:01.519> piston<00:04:01.970> is<00:04:02.419> is<00:04:03.349> just<00:04:03.650> remarkable

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:09.470 

we<00:04:07.980> can<00:04:08.189> pretty<00:04:08.459> much<00:04:08.549> do<00:04:08.879> anything<00:04:09.030> with<00:04:09.390> a

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
we can pretty much do anything with a

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.319 
we can pretty much do anything with a
Stamper<00:04:09.900> and<00:04:10.489> maintain<00:04:11.489> the<00:04:11.790> the<00:04:12.150> role

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.329 
Stamper and maintain the the role

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:14.119 
Stamper and maintain the the role
controller<00:04:12.719> we<00:04:12.900> have<00:04:13.049> now<00:04:13.260> which<00:04:13.499> is<00:04:13.680> just<00:04:13.889> so

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:14.129 
controller we have now which is just so

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:34.190 
controller we have now which is just so
much<00:04:14.310> better<00:04:14.549> than<00:04:14.730> a<00:04:14.819> factory<00:04:15.209> item

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.720 

we<00:04:34.500> could<00:04:34.740> probably<00:04:34.890> still<00:04:35.310> do<00:04:35.460> with<00:04:35.580> some

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.730 
we could probably still do with some

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.580 
we could probably still do with some
improvements<00:04:36.300> but<00:04:36.420> it's<00:04:36.600> much<00:04:37.200> better<00:04:37.410> than

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
improvements but it's much better than

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.040 
improvements but it's much better than
the<00:04:37.740> production<00:04:38.490> car<00:04:38.700> the<00:04:39.420> production<00:04:39.690> car

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
the production car the production car

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.630 
the production car the production car
seemed<00:04:40.320> to<00:04:40.440> be<00:04:40.530> quite<00:04:40.710> disconnected<00:04:41.400> in<00:04:41.550> the

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:41.640 
seemed to be quite disconnected in the

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:46.160 
seemed to be quite disconnected in the
rear<00:04:41.790> and<00:04:42.140> when<00:04:43.140> we<00:04:43.320> change<00:04:44.160> direction<00:04:45.170> the

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:46.170 
rear and when we change direction the

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:48.590 
rear and when we change direction the
rear<00:04:46.350> would<00:04:46.530> flop<00:04:46.860> very<00:04:47.130> quickly<00:04:47.430> so<00:04:48.330> I<00:04:48.390> think

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600 
rear would flop very quickly so I think

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.940 
rear would flop very quickly so I think
that's<00:04:48.780> quite<00:04:48.930> a<00:04:49.020> good<00:04:49.200> improvement<00:04:49.500> but

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
that's quite a good improvement but

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:59.380 
that's quite a good improvement but
still<00:04:50.130> a<00:04:50.400> little<00:04:50.490> way<00:04:50.850> to<00:04:50.880> go

00:04:59.380 --> 00:04:59.390 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:01.450 

you
