00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.800
 I'm with against the Zemmour and lorena 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.570
 o'neal who are dancers who 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.580
 work that me for a long time who 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.229
 have had this experience with the 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.539
 Bolshoi dancers who was for me 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.780
 very very very moving because I have 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:16.630
 saw both my dancers welcome the 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.010
 Bolshoi dancers myself welcome 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.290
 the dancers of the Bolshoi 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.800
 here we were also greeted with 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:26.709
 heat to mount this project and it was 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.660
 really great to see how the 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.090
 individuals got together from two 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:34.300
 country to build a common thing 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.040
 is together and what's more a project 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.360
 artistic that is as always the 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.910
 artistic projects that's things the 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.200
 more the most intangible originally 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.310
 so this is the hardest part of this 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.680
 recourse to banks to find themselves 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.370
 around that and I think that was it 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.140
 a great success 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.790
 I do not know how will be the show 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.930
 but I know he adventures the 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.930
 show was very beautiful
