00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:06.690
 look at this stupidly 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.379
 they are smooth, harmoniously elegant 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.440
 curved 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.679
 Even so, what can you do with that very easily 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.809
 if you know how to do it 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:18.170
 here is the tool for that 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.170
 instrumentalities 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.800
 a part consists of points 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.460
 anchors and connections hessen 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.919
 segments when you create a new path 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.590
 At first, the segments are simple 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:37.199
 stretch but that can easily be changed 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.900
 you click on a segment and hold the 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:44.100
 pressed the mouse button so she lets herself 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:45.839
 forgave like a rubber band conclusion 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.510
 But people can do much more than that 

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:50.730
 rubber bands because I can with everyone 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.030
 affect segment as it is 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.010
 Anchor point arrives serve this 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.270
 small stretches at the end of the 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.219
 so-called grip points sit at this 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.379
 stretch the segment hugs 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.860
 namely always when it is in the anchor point 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.170
 arrives you change the small 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.580
 stretch so the curvature changes 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.920
 Both are located in the segment accordingly 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.570
 stretch a anchor point on one 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.250
 straight 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:25.080
 so the path makes a smooth turn 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.690
 but the two do not stretch 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:31.740
 a straight says, the path a 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:35.729
 Kink here are the tool 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:38.580
 Settings for the vehicle especially 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.920
 important is the editing mode there 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.979
 There are three types once the design 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.740
 mode the edit mode and the 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.060
 Let's start with the different ones 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.310
 design mode 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.670
 that contains the most important 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.410
 possibilities around a path new 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:58.680
 create 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:02:02.399
 you can make a path longer by 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:06.270
 to add new anchor points the new one 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:08.060
 anchor point will be automatically with the 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:12.330
 last anchor point connected 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:14.730
 but only if the last one 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.550
 anchor point is the current anchor point 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.569
 You can see that here on this 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:23.390
 square box 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:25.670
 now the last anchor point is not 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.379
 the more current that you see is the one 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.230
 hollow and if I have a new one now 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:33.920
 anchor point he will not wake up anymore 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:38.870
 automatically connected to the last one like that 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:42.310
 What am I doing tight? I'll click 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:45.560
 an existing anchor point 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.700
 then i can move that and the 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.200
 wine segment 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.200
 follow up 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:58.959
 now two anchor points are up to date and 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.790
 if I follow the moves themselves 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.189
 each other so that both are 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.620
 postponed 

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:10.319
 I click a segment I can do that 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:13.120
 forgive but you already know that 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:15.220
 the edit mode is to edit 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.670
 because not to create new 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:21.370
 I click here outside even happens 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:24.370
 nothing to attach and extend 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:28.379
 but the design minister is in between 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:31.239
 I can put new anchor points 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:33.850
 this between anchor point or click 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:37.210
 I just click on a segment 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:40.600
 and it's in there when I'm at it 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:43.630
 had pressed the mouse button can I 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.910
 This anchor point also move in the 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.600
 moment where I release the mouse button it 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.530
 past 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.840
 I can not move this anymore 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.150
 I can delete it 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:58.090
 I have to press the shift button 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:03.160
 click on a point so that would ship 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:05.680
 press on the anchor point and click 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.180
 already he disappears I can also 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.060
 to do with a segment 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:13.090
 I click on I press that 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.250
 Shift-click on a segment and 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.230
 that disappears that I leave that 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.080
 anchor point still disappearing as well 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:23.890
 ship that to press 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:25.780
 I can cover and walk away very easily 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:28.890
 To exclude such a path I only have to 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:31.300
 at first and last 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:34.120
 Ankerpunkt click and it is already 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.430
 path closed and comes to an end 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:39.070
 now also the moving tool like 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.660
 the word already says I can 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:44.940
 Now I can move the father 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.940
 push where I would like it
