00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.810
 the current situation remains difficult 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.460
 the downtrend of world prices 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.270
 did not reverse during the 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.010
 last weeks 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.470
 as we can see on this 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.260
 chart with the price changes of the 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.850
 butter and skim milk powder 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.160
 the situation of the markets 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.530
 it's pretty enough neither in terms of offers 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.750
 since the beginning of the year with hindsight 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.090
 of production during the first 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.910
 quarter as well in new zealand 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.870
 that within the European Union 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.970
 evolution of third party production 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.589
 in the european union since the end 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.180
 quotas is not known for 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:55.210
 all Member States 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.870
 but one thing is sure the tidal wave 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:01.390
 announced and feared did not take place 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.220
 third party production was rather 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.070
 dynamic in a number of countries 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.940
 like denmark ireland or 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.310
 still poland 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.229
 but at the same time the growth of 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.180
 collection was fairly well managed 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.549
 in the two main countries 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.890
 producers of the European Union 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:20.409
 weekly polls in germany 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.630
 thus show enough growth 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:25.360
 moderate over the first six weeks 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:28.960
 post quota period 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:31.000
 the report is identical in France the 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.390
 peak of collection was reached end of April 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.720
 without joining the profile of the curve of 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:40.840
 2014 according to franceagrim the price of milk 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.510
 cow was 301 euros per thousand 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.790
 liters in the month of March 2015 it is in 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:48.360
 very clear decline since the beginning of 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:52.300
 fourth quarter of 2014 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:56.100
 after a moderate decline in 2014 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:58.590
 of the order of 3% Monday if pampa 2 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.200
 from the livestock institute shows since 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.330
 the beginning of 2015 a slight 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.740
 bullish trend for all 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.039
 operating expenses that are 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.950
 represented in blue on this graph the 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.770
 food stations bought in glass and 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.840
 energy and lubricants in red all have 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.720
 both went up as 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.610
 conclusion the first half of 2015 is 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.989
 particularly complicated for 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.870
 dairy farmers in terms of 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:27.330
 cash they are faced with a 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.239
 a fairly clear drop in the price of milk 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.550
 since the end of 2014 and a 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.160
 parallel increase in their 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.350
 exploitation charges 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.989
 an improvement in the economic climate 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.750
 second semester nevertheless constitutes a 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.880
 fairly likely scenario 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.860
 the latest production trends 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.750
 indeed shows that there is no strong 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.730
 bullish drift in the main 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.580
 global dairy basins which 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.470
 is a rather positive sign for 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.620
 the balanced markets in the months to 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.620
 come
