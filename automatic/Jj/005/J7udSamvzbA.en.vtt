00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 how to find out no pledge or car 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.750
 first try to contact the traffic police 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.280
 yes and request this information probably 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.710
 there are such public services 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.880
 registration of the pledge agreement here hide 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:17.670
 time this item is not included in our 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:21.420
 long ago and powers we are officially given 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:27.119
 we do not have average 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:28.590
 didn't tear africa marks on a blog and can 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.760
 then be in the bank we can give 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.769
 some information 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.600
 for sure there is a common database on 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.120
 which you can check is not in the pledge or 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.510
 car fouling time which base 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.680
 no data local banks lead such 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.129
 databases in general cans it is not 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.969
 registering authority 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:50.129
 that is, it is not his duty to lead 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.940
 what the hell high bank is doing for yourself 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:58.879
 first of all, to third parties 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:03.199
 information about the car only on his 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:05.100
 pledge or no bank is required 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:08.939
 Except can only be 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.159
 requirements of regulatory authorities or 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.110
 judicial authorities it turns out that buying 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.630
 check whether the car is in 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.820
 pledge and almost impossible but there is 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.530
 a number of points on which the buyer is worth 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.720
 pay attention to avoid problems 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.549
 with the car in the future first 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.009
 carefully study the technical passport 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.380
 means and find out the original is or 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.280
 duplicate the presence of a segment 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:36.200
 a person is not a guarantee that 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:38.970
 the car is not a mortgage that's why 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:42.780
 how to determine what subscription 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.400
 that is, duplicate this on look special 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.090
 garter marks are usually written there 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.690
 issued in return 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.580
 but naturally the kind of subscription when she 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.500
 let's say a car there is 45 years old naturally 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.510
 can't look smooth exactly this 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.880
 grief sell the car by a duplicate not 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.050
 Fear might be interested in why 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.420
 pts was lost 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.400
 and maybe he's in the bank and dishonest 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.250
 the owner just ordered a traffic policeman new 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.090
 Document born where were the items on 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.100
 can request 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.710
 it is this copy of the original shabby 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.990
 seconds and what he is there in and they in 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.150
 the bank drank the important document was also in 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.990
 PTS indicates how many owners were 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.790
 the car 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.070
 if in a short time the machine 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.470
 has been resold several times this 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:25.490
 should alert you at least like 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.450
 legally you can still insure it 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.540
 sales contract 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.920
 to the person who is the car dealer and 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.100
 just subscribed to what he 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.950
 the car passed the car passed the car 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.560
 I got the money but add there 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:46.650
 wording that I confirm that this 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:48.540
 the car is not pledged and not needed 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.019
 tax arrest and she is not in 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.580
 hijacking 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:53.670
 this contract is not necessary with this 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.260
 must be notarized he has 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.510
 the same legal force and just then 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.040
 if a person except that he 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.680
 did not go abroad there will be 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.260
 calmly go to court with this document 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.330
 find out for sure on the pledge or car 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.370
 as it turned out almost impossible 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.980
 one advice from all specialists 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.200
 read the documents carefully if you 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.470
 something embarrassing better give up 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.470
 purchases
