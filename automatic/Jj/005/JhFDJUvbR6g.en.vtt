so let me show you that again this time
I<00:01:49.150> go<00:01:49.330> a<00:01:49.360> little<00:01:49.510> bit<00:01:49.750> slower

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
I go a little bit slower

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.470 
I go a little bit slower
you<00:01:50.680> see<00:01:50.890> missed<00:01:51.130> the<00:01:51.280> magic<00:01:51.640> move<00:01:51.820> Vicky<00:01:52.180> see

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:52.480 
you see missed the magic move Vicky see

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.690 
you see missed the magic move Vicky see
whenever<00:01:53.140> I<00:01:53.230> wave<00:01:53.500> my<00:01:53.530> hands<00:01:54.070> over<00:01:54.280> the<00:01:54.370> cards

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
whenever I wave my hands over the cards

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.760 
whenever I wave my hands over the cards
just<00:01:55.390> like<00:01:55.540> that<00:01:55.720> it's<00:01:55.990> like<00:01:56.110> a<00:01:56.140> magic<00:01:56.560> move

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
just like that it's like a magic move

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.430 
just like that it's like a magic move
and<00:01:57.130> you<00:01:57.460> know<00:01:57.550> what<00:01:57.670> that<00:01:57.790> does<00:01:58.000> that

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
and you know what that does that

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.720 
and you know what that does that
actually<00:01:59.440> brings<00:01:59.710> the<00:01:59.830> card<00:02:00.160> to<00:02:00.280> the<00:02:00.400> top<00:02:00.580> you

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:00.730 
actually brings the card to the top you

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:02.040 
actually brings the card to the top you
see<00:02:00.880> I<00:02:00.910> just<00:02:01.000> wave<00:02:01.300> it<00:02:01.330> over<00:02:01.660> just<00:02:01.810> like<00:02:01.990> that

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
see I just wave it over just like that

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.260 
see I just wave it over just like that
and<00:02:02.440> once<00:02:03.100> again<00:02:03.250> the<00:02:03.460> car<00:02:03.640> comes<00:02:03.850> on<00:02:03.970> top<00:02:04.090> it

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
and once again the car comes on top it

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.420 
and once again the car comes on top it
works<00:02:04.480> every<00:02:04.840> single<00:02:04.870> time<00:02:05.170> no<00:02:05.950> matter<00:02:05.980> where

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
works every single time no matter where

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:07.770 
works every single time no matter where
in<00:02:06.520> the<00:02:06.550> deck<00:02:06.790> it<00:02:06.940> goes<00:02:07.120> will<00:02:07.360> put<00:02:07.540> it<00:02:07.630> back

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
in the deck it goes will put it back

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.779 
in the deck it goes will put it back
inside<00:02:08.259> that's<00:02:08.679> about<00:02:08.920> the<00:02:08.979> middle<00:02:09.280> now<00:02:09.610> let's

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
inside that's about the middle now let's

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.309 
inside that's about the middle now let's
get<00:02:09.940> down<00:02:10.090> to<00:02:10.119> brass<00:02:10.330> tacks<00:02:10.420> or<00:02:10.840> would<00:02:11.050> you<00:02:11.170> say

get down to brass tacks or would you say

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:13.530 
get down to brass tacks or would you say
be<00:02:11.470> a<00:02:11.500> much<00:02:11.739> better<00:02:11.920> trick<00:02:12.250> if<00:02:12.400> you<00:02:12.430> held<00:02:13.269> on<00:02:13.420> to

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
be a much better trick if you held on to

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.880 
be a much better trick if you held on to
the<00:02:13.660> cards<00:02:13.930> you<00:02:14.080> waved<00:02:14.290> your<00:02:14.440> hand<00:02:14.500> over<00:02:14.830> in
