00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.830
 it's going him everyone these 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.250
 denominations of exile to med there would have 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.029
 the geeks 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:21.150
 so I finally received my guen 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.600
 capture to precisely record 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.359
 videos on xbox 360 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.689
 so yeah I bought them on amazon 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:29.910
 119 euros 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.270
 because it was cheaper than the 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.680
 oppose them if you know and in addition 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:39.020
 the advantage is that we do not need 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.760
 a computer actually connected by hd pvr 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:44.040
 finally the guen captures in fact it takes 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.200
 just an external hard drive so by 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.320
 example - that's pretty new if possible 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.770
 or else a usb key that you will have 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.980
 formatted in ntfs so less indeed 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:59.010
 made 16 gigabytes I did not know well so 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.140
 that was a good choice I think 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.850
 so we will start open the box 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.090
 and then we 'll see what she 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.090
 contains 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:15.590
 so here I have never seen a jpv 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:19.009
 still in what to have a little a little 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:21.790
 that it gives you had offered 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:26.540
 little videos I think quite often 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:29.770
 on park ride orthez in the commedia 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:33.140
 also blackhawks 2 maybe goodbye 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.930
 I want can run the rooster is what we 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.420
 will say he's doing well here and 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:41.170
 this is the yes I have a little fuck box 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:46.670
 in November it does not matter my friend 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:53.300
 so what we have is the box of the game 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:54.520
 hd capture so who does ps3 xbox wii 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.950
 as you can see 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.960
 so it's actually a cord with three 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.670
 taken so for the xbox the ps3 the wii 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.770
 I saw that they changed the box 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.810
 since not shine it seems to me 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.929
 I do not know anymore laura means okay 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.840
 so we will try to open the box 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.100
 so what it contains 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.440
 hey it's a year of English 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.480
 I nied the camera is English 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.160
 so good I do not know if you can read 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.750
 way it's not very important since 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.940
 you will put the amazon link if you 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.640
 do you want to buy it too? 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.260
 so we will start to see the box I 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.680
 not sure where to start opening 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.880
 in the leg to panic girls 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.760
 who are in this case it would piss me off 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:37.459
 what's more nice amazon since I 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.230
 have received in two days it seems to me the 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:44.150
 delivery guy was super nice and so 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:46.600
 aulas and it's really cool so we're going 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.030
 get out of the box 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:54.440
 so we'll see how it looks 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:57.140
 I leave the box here so we go 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:01.040
 open down it looks well protected 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:03.230
 it's cool there is interest since seen 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.989
 how much it still costs it would make me 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:11.170
 a little annoyed that it is packed to the va 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:11.170
 quickly and that everything is nickel in it so 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.540
 ok I watched videos on 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.240
 youtube we could have told me a lot of 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.890
 although this capture gain so we'll see 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:25.150
 ourselves by the videos we go 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:29.430
 do we see the contents of the box to 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:32.350
 a little guide so pretty normal basic 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:35.220
 after what can we here I think 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:39.120
 that it's the block the power supply 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:42.060
 we will see to let the food 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:47.680
 the power plant actually 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:50.650
 so we'll put this here the cables 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.850
 universal cab so ps3 or an xbox 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.520
 it seems to me that this is what it is 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:57.000
 three web meetings the three on one 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:59.790
 only case so we will try to open his 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.790
 for a little see the jaws of the cables 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:06.790
 so to his mother that seems to me well thought out 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:10.510
 so here are the cables that's what's 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:12.730
 branch was waiting relegated 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:16.720
 that's what's hooked up to 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:18.190
 the end of the game capture it seems and 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.170
 it makes those voices there you see from 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:24.880
 xbox cables 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:29.080
 the cable the cables ps3 and 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:31.930
 oh no no if he put the cable yes with 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:34.080
 the ps3 cable forgiveness for the ps3 wii and 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:39.300
 xbox 360 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:41.160
 so here's the little girl 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.330
 sponsorship clip 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.920
 the converter in fact what is 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.720
 it is the plug converter us 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.650
 American companies to go on 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:52.030
 French catches 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:54.330
 a small converter so that's okay 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:58.870
 to be an American product 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:05:02.470
 this is of course the case that is 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:05.590
 small who looks really nice to the 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:08.200
 blow it's super light so there you 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:11.410
 have the outputs between summer the 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:13.630
 outputs between and consoles we go them 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:16.830
 super light you have tried 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:20.800
 oh yeah the super light in the underworld 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:25.240
 after there had large large it 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:28.090
 more stuff for this pv m6 we can 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.550
 to say that it's the remote that's 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.770
 really great g maybe you can 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:35.200
 on your couch and launched a catch 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:36.730
 of a video so the batteries 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.900
 provided with it can be emphasized 

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:40.200
 since it's really pretty rare that they 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:43.330
 offer stacks of times that belly 

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.890
 so you have up the little cables I 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.290
 think they're going on TV or pre 

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:48.220
 green actually I do not know what actually 

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:50.110
 I 'll maybe make you a video 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:52.420
 installation and a video of course 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:53.740
 when I start playing for you 

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:57.210
 show a little how happened 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:58.740
 how are you so that's actually it's 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:03.700
 the guides 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:05.350
 so here is the French Canadian 

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:07.990
 so there is already a bit of French in 

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:11.540
 the guide is always that 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:13.220
 that's still it's won so 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:16.150
 here I hope to make a video soon 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:21.320
 for the installation of the game capture 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:23.270

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:27.350
 new update the menu is finally

 in French and in addition we can support 

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:31.700
