they<00:02:03.590> arranged<00:02:03.950> in<00:02:04.099> two<00:02:04.250> different<00:02:05.020> quarter

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
they arranged in two different quarter

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.109 
they arranged in two different quarter
tone<00:02:06.229> rows<00:02:06.470> so<00:02:06.830> you<00:02:06.890> can<00:02:07.160> what<00:02:07.490> and<00:02:07.849> actually

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
tone rows so you can what and actually

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:16.510 
tone rows so you can what and actually
here<00:02:13.959> this<00:02:14.959> one<00:02:15.170> is<00:02:15.349> completely<00:02:16.190> different

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
here this one is completely different

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.510 
here this one is completely different
category<00:02:16.670> in<00:02:17.209> goes<00:02:17.450> the<00:02:17.860> 19th<00:02:18.860> century<00:02:19.250> is<00:02:19.400> a

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
category in goes the 19th century is a

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:32.090 
category in goes the 19th century is a
harmonium<00:02:20.030> that<00:02:20.300> i<00:02:20.390> completely<00:02:20.780> automated

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.949 

then<00:02:33.100> Buda<00:02:33.520> NOLA<00:02:33.730> there<00:02:34.180> that's<00:02:34.480> one<00:02:34.720> of<00:02:34.840> the

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
then Buda NOLA there that's one of the

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.500 
then Buda NOLA there that's one of the
base<00:02:35.170> instruments<00:02:36.130> of<00:02:36.400> the<00:02:36.640> orchestra<00:02:36.700> the

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
base instruments of the orchestra the

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.000 
base instruments of the orchestra the
only<00:02:37.750> problem<00:02:38.050> with<00:02:38.110> this<00:02:38.319> one<00:02:38.530> is<00:02:38.680> that<00:02:38.709> so

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
only problem with this one is that so

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.070 
only problem with this one is that so
big<00:02:39.250> but<00:02:40.090> I<00:02:40.120> couldn't<00:02:40.510> make<00:02:40.660> it<00:02:40.720> any<00:02:40.959> smaller

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
big but I couldn't make it any smaller

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.320 
big but I couldn't make it any smaller
because<00:02:41.590> that's<00:02:42.220> the<00:02:42.459> physical<00:02:42.940> length<00:02:43.120> it

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
because that's the physical length it

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.150 
because that's the physical length it
takes<00:02:43.630> to<00:02:43.990> sound<00:02:44.290> a<00:02:44.410> low<00:02:44.590> C<00:02:46.590> well<00:02:47.590> you<00:02:47.770> see<00:02:48.010> if

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
takes to sound a low C well you see if

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.530 
takes to sound a low C well you see if
it<00:02:48.280> went<00:02:48.400> an<00:02:48.580> octave<00:02:48.940> lower

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
it went an octave lower

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.750 
it went an octave lower
I<00:02:49.570> need<00:02:49.900> not<00:02:50.080> a<00:02:50.110> building<00:02:53.280> so<00:02:54.280> this<00:02:54.459> instrument

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
I need not a building so this instrument

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.630 
I need not a building so this instrument
is<00:02:55.090> a<00:02:55.120> Thunder<00:02:55.840> wood<00:02:56.020> and<00:02:56.470> this<00:02:57.010> machine<00:02:57.489> I

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
is a Thunder wood and this machine I

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.910 
is a Thunder wood and this machine I

it's the category of the when he called
nature<00:03:03.040> sounds<00:03:03.489> in<00:03:03.880> one<00:03:04.270> machine<00:03:04.630> so<00:03:05.230> you<00:03:05.290> find

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
nature sounds in one machine so you find

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.140 
nature sounds in one machine so you find
the<00:03:06.670> big<00:03:06.850> thing<00:03:07.090> here<00:03:07.360> is<00:03:07.420> at<00:03:07.780> under<00:03:08.110> sheet

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
the big thing here is at under sheet

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.060 
the big thing here is at under sheet
imitative<00:03:10.150> of<00:03:10.390> thunder<00:03:10.930> of<00:03:11.050> course<00:03:11.350> then<00:03:11.950> you

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
imitative of thunder of course then you

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.880 
imitative of thunder of course then you
with<00:03:12.220> a<00:03:12.250> storm<00:03:12.700> machine<00:03:13.000> hear<00:03:13.630> the<00:03:14.620> wind
