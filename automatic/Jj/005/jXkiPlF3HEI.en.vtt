quite a lot of pressure on this knife to

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.780 
quite a lot of pressure on this knife to
be<00:01:49.200> able<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.470> close<00:01:49.740> this<00:01:49.979> against<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.520> force

opener here but you also have on this

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:54.339 
opener here but you also have on this
tool<00:04:51.710> a<00:04:51.949> saw<00:04:52.360> so<00:04:53.360> this<00:04:53.539> is<00:04:53.689> a<00:04:53.719> kind<00:04:53.960> of<00:04:54.110> weird

00:04:54.339 --> 00:04:54.349 
tool a saw so this is a kind of weird

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:59.499 
tool a saw so this is a kind of weird
beast<00:04:54.919> of<00:04:55.189> a<00:04:55.280> tool<00:04:55.599> as<00:04:56.599> you<00:04:56.780> can<00:04:56.960> see<00:04:58.389> some<00:04:59.389> of

00:04:59.499 --> 00:04:59.509 
beast of a tool as you can see some of

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:01.360 
beast of a tool as you can see some of
the<00:04:59.569> versions<00:04:59.750> of<00:05:00.110> this<00:05:00.289> come<00:05:00.680> with<00:05:00.860> a<00:05:00.889> strip

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
the versions of this come with a strip

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.600 
the versions of this come with a strip
of<00:05:01.400> tin<00:05:02.150> that<00:05:03.050> comes<00:05:03.349> folded<00:05:03.830> over<00:05:03.919> than<00:05:04.219> the

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
of tin that comes folded over than the

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.390 
of tin that comes folded over than the
saw<00:05:05.000> blade<00:05:05.300> here<00:05:05.629> so<00:05:06.289> you<00:05:06.349> would<00:05:06.800> be<00:05:07.009> able<00:05:07.279> to

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
saw blade here so you would be able to

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.390 
saw blade here so you would be able to
use<00:05:07.699> this<00:05:08.210> end<00:05:08.509> of<00:05:08.689> the<00:05:08.810> tool<00:05:09.020> safely<00:05:09.620> without

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 
use this end of the tool safely without

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.010 
use this end of the tool safely without
worrying<00:05:10.699> about<00:05:10.849> catching<00:05:11.389> your<00:05:11.419> fingers<00:05:11.870> on

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
worrying about catching your fingers on

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.490 
worrying about catching your fingers on
the<00:05:12.050> teeth<00:05:12.409> of<00:05:12.770> the<00:05:13.189> saw<00:05:13.669> they're<00:05:14.479> very<00:05:14.930> very

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:15.500 
the teeth of the saw they're very very

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.640 
the teeth of the saw they're very very
aggressive<00:05:16.219> backward<00:05:17.000> facing<00:05:17.270> teeth<00:05:17.840> if<00:05:18.259> you

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
aggressive backward facing teeth if you

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.929 
aggressive backward facing teeth if you
can<00:05:18.830> see<00:05:19.039> that<00:05:19.900> you're<00:05:20.900> gonna<00:05:21.050> remove<00:05:21.789> lots<00:05:22.789> of

00:05:22.929 --> 00:05:22.939 
can see that you're gonna remove lots of

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:26.439 
can see that you're gonna remove lots of
material<00:05:23.629> on<00:05:23.840> every<00:05:24.319> stroke<00:05:24.669> backwards<00:05:25.669> but

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:26.449 
material on every stroke backwards but

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:28.899 
material on every stroke backwards but
with<00:05:26.629> every<00:05:26.870> stroke<00:05:27.110> forwards<00:05:27.680> I<00:05:27.979> don't<00:05:28.729> think

00:05:28.899 --> 00:05:28.909 
with every stroke forwards I don't think

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:30.969 
with every stroke forwards I don't think
you're<00:05:29.000> gonna<00:05:29.120> do<00:05:29.330> much<00:05:29.599> so<00:05:30.289> they<00:05:30.740> look<00:05:30.949> really

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:30.979 
you're gonna do much so they look really

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:34.809 
you're gonna do much so they look really
mean<00:05:31.569> but<00:05:32.569> I<00:05:32.629> reckon<00:05:33.169> the<00:05:33.620> current<00:05:34.069> Victorinox

00:05:34.809 --> 00:05:34.819 
mean but I reckon the current Victorinox

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:38.350 
mean but I reckon the current Victorinox
saw<00:05:35.120> is<00:05:36.110> probably<00:05:36.710> better<00:05:36.979> than<00:05:37.129> this<00:05:37.400> one<00:05:37.610> but

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 
saw is probably better than this one but

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.450 
saw is probably better than this one but
it<00:05:38.479> does<00:05:38.629> look<00:05:38.810> it<00:05:39.199> does<00:05:39.379> look<00:05:39.560> unusual<00:05:40.039> quite

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:40.460 
it does look it does look unusual quite

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.469 
it does look it does look unusual quite
weird

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:43.479 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:45.879 

here<00:05:44.479> as<00:05:44.870> I've<00:05:45.110> said<00:05:45.289> yeah<00:05:45.529> you<00:05:45.589> put<00:05:45.770> your

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:45.889 
here as I've said yeah you put your

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:48.760 
here as I've said yeah you put your
bottle<00:05:46.159> opener<00:05:46.550> you<00:05:47.000> can<00:05:47.569> open<00:05:47.960> apart<00:05:48.319> here

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:48.770 
bottle opener you can open apart here

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:53.350 
bottle opener you can open apart here
you<00:05:49.729> can<00:05:49.879> just<00:05:50.060> see<00:05:50.270> that<00:05:50.300> that's<00:05:50.629> ER<00:05:52.360> just

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.360 
you can just see that that's ER just

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.209 
you can just see that that's ER just
sort<00:05:53.599> of<00:05:53.659> beveled<00:05:54.080> down<00:05:54.319> there<00:05:54.589> to<00:05:54.830> create<00:05:55.129> an

00:05:55.209 --> 00:05:55.219 
sort of beveled down there to create an

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:58.089 
sort of beveled down there to create an
edge<00:05:55.400> and<00:05:55.990> you<00:05:56.990> would<00:05:57.139> also<00:05:57.379> use<00:05:57.680> this<00:05:57.860> as<00:05:57.919> a

00:05:58.089 --> 00:05:58.099 
edge and you would also use this as a

00:05:58.099 --> 00:06:04.749 
edge and you would also use this as a
screwdriver<00:06:00.849> so<00:06:01.849> very<00:06:02.089> unusual<00:06:03.430> perhaps<00:06:04.430> this

00:06:04.749 --> 00:06:04.759 
screwdriver so very unusual perhaps this

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:09.399 
screwdriver so very unusual perhaps this
the<00:06:05.029> unusual<00:06:05.569> look<00:06:05.779> of<00:06:05.930> this<00:06:06.110> tool<00:06:08.139> was<00:06:09.139> one<00:06:09.289> of

00:06:09.399 --> 00:06:09.409 
the unusual look of this tool was one of

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:11.529 
the unusual look of this tool was one of
the<00:06:09.469> reasons<00:06:09.860> this<00:06:10.069> particular<00:06:10.939> range<00:06:11.330> of

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:11.539 
the reasons this particular range of

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:13.570 
the reasons this particular range of
knives<00:06:11.750> a<00:06:11.990> safari<00:06:12.379> knife<00:06:12.589> didn't<00:06:12.919> catch<00:06:13.099> on<00:06:13.339> I

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:13.580 
knives a safari knife didn't catch on I

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:17.490 
knives a safari knife didn't catch on I
don't<00:06:13.879> know<00:06:14.120> but<00:06:14.740> there's<00:06:15.740> certainly<00:06:16.449> a

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:17.500 
don't know but there's certainly a

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.409 
don't know but there's certainly a
strange<00:06:18.500> hybrid<00:06:18.800> of<00:06:19.250> a<00:06:19.789> number<00:06:20.060> of<00:06:20.089> other

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:20.419 
strange hybrid of a number of other

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:24.429 
strange hybrid of a number of other
familiar<00:06:21.699> Victorinox<00:06:22.699> tools<00:06:23.080> not<00:06:24.080> sure<00:06:24.259> how<00:06:24.409> I

00:06:24.429 --> 00:06:24.439 
familiar Victorinox tools not sure how I

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:27.040 
familiar Victorinox tools not sure how I
feel<00:06:24.770> about<00:06:25.180> having<00:06:26.180> so<00:06:26.659> many<00:06:26.870> tools

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:27.050 
feel about having so many tools

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:29.290 
feel about having so many tools
particularly<00:06:27.529> with<00:06:27.740> the<00:06:27.830> sore<00:06:27.860> paw<00:06:28.250> on<00:06:28.460> just

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:29.300 
particularly with the sore paw on just

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:33.899 
particularly with the sore paw on just
one<00:06:30.099> length<00:06:31.099> of<00:06:31.430> Steel<00:06:31.729> like<00:06:31.759> this<00:06:32.270> but

00:06:33.899 --> 00:06:33.909 
one length of Steel like this but

00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:35.579 
one length of Steel like this but
interesting<00:06:34.909> nonetheless

00:06:35.579 --> 00:06:35.589 
interesting nonetheless

00:06:35.589 --> 00:06:40.059 
interesting nonetheless
so<00:06:36.589> let's<00:06:36.770> put<00:06:36.979> that<00:06:37.159> tool<00:06:37.459> away<00:06:38.589> and<00:06:39.589> moving

00:06:40.059 --> 00:06:40.069 
so let's put that tool away and moving

00:06:40.069 --> 00:06:40.870 
so let's put that tool away and moving
around<00:06:40.159> to<00:06:40.490> the<00:06:40.580> other

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:40.880 
around to the other

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.380 
around to the other
sides<00:06:41.120> we<00:06:41.450> have<00:06:41.480> just<00:06:41.900> two<00:06:42.080> more<00:06:42.290> tools<00:06:42.560> here

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:43.390

sides we have just two more tools here
we<00:06:44.390> have<00:06:44.690> the<00:06:44.960> corkscrew<00:06:46.570> longer<00:06:48.100> shoots<00:06:49.100> up

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:49.280 
we have the corkscrew longer shoots up

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.150 
we have the corkscrew longer shoots up
from<00:06:49.430> the<00:06:49.490> middle<00:06:49.760> but<00:06:49.880> is<00:06:50.000> longer<00:06:50.390> than<00:06:50.540> the
