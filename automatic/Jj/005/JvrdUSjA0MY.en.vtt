making reef on to use ever since the

making reef on to use ever since the
fact<00:01:20.070> he<00:01:20.130> doesn't<00:01:20.369> get<00:01:20.430> forward<00:01:20.729> too<00:01:20.850> much<00:01:21.030> but

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
fact he doesn't get forward too much but

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.330 
fact he doesn't get forward too much but
when<00:01:21.570> he<00:01:21.630> does<00:01:21.720> he<00:01:21.930> didn't<00:01:22.619> tends<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:23.009> get<00:01:23.159> back

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340

as<00:01:23.549> quickly<00:01:23.970> as<00:01:24.090> he<00:01:24.150> does<00:01:24.299> go<00:01:24.450> forward<00:01:24.780> so<00:01:24.900> it's

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
as quickly as he does go forward so it's

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.539 
as quickly as he does go forward so it's
pretty<00:01:25.140> evened<00:01:25.530> out<00:01:25.590> with<00:01:25.740> him<00:01:25.890> onto<00:01:26.430> me

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
captain at the CDM I don't think he

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.510 
captain at the CDM I don't think he
worked<00:01:33.990> too<00:01:34.170> well<00:01:34.200> he'd<00:01:34.590> be<00:01:34.710> suited<00:01:35.040> more<00:01:35.250> as<00:01:35.460> a

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
worked too well he'd be suited more as a

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.280 
worked too well he'd be suited more as a
sentiment<00:01:36.060> fielder<00:01:36.390> because<00:01:36.750> of<00:01:37.049> his<00:01:37.140> high

sentiment fielder because of his high
high<00:01:37.500> work<00:01:37.740> rate<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.189> then<00:01:38.310> this<00:01:38.490> goes<00:01:38.700> the

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
high work rate and then this goes the

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.179 
high work rate and then this goes the
same<00:01:39.000> thing<00:01:39.240> with<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:39.689> CDN<00:01:40.500> partner<00:01:40.829> which<00:01:41.009> is

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
same thing with a CDN partner which is

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.859 
same thing with a CDN partner which is
Aaron<00:01:41.520> Ramsey<00:01:41.820> both<00:01:42.210> we've<00:01:42.450> got<00:01:42.570> high<00:01:42.720> high

medium high work rate credit or has got

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:15.979 
medium high work rate credit or has got
media<00:04:14.489> media<00:04:14.670> so<00:04:14.850> the<00:04:14.940> defensive<00:04:15.329> rule<00:04:15.600> was

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
media media so the defensive rule was

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.620 
media media so the defensive rule was
pretty<00:04:16.350> solid<00:04:16.739> RTC<00:04:17.400> dm's<00:04:17.639> were<00:04:17.850> probably<00:04:18.450> the

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
pretty solid RTC dm's were probably the

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.839 
pretty solid RTC dm's were probably the
worst<00:04:18.930> point<00:04:19.109> of<00:04:19.260> team<00:04:19.409> like<00:04:19.560> they<00:04:20.430> both<00:04:20.609> want

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:20.849 
worst point of team like they both want

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:22.820 
worst point of team like they both want
to<00:04:21.060> wear<00:04:21.359> weren't<00:04:21.690> too<00:04:21.840> bad<00:04:22.019> but

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
to wear weren't too bad but

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.740 
to wear weren't too bad but
they're<00:04:23.250> both<00:04:23.460> suited<00:04:23.939> more<00:04:24.120> as<00:04:24.300> a<00:04:24.330> center

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
they're both suited more as a center

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.390 
they're both suited more as a center
midfielder<00:04:25.199> rather<00:04:25.379> than<00:04:25.500> a<00:04:25.650> defensive<00:04:26.280> my

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
midfielder rather than a defensive my

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.330 
midfielder rather than a defensive my
one<00:04:26.669> like<00:04:27.330> I<00:04:27.360> said<00:04:27.509> if<00:04:27.689> I<00:04:28.080> drew<00:04:28.470> this<00:04:29.099> team

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
one like I said if I drew this team

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.820 
one like I said if I drew this team
again<00:04:29.490> I<00:04:29.819> wouldn't<00:04:30.419> take<00:04:30.539> out<00:04:30.720> Jared<00:04:31.080> and<00:04:31.289> rams

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
again I wouldn't take out Jared and rams

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.050 
again I wouldn't take out Jared and rams
you<00:04:31.889> think<00:04:32.039> the<00:04:32.099> fact<00:04:32.310> that<00:04:32.370> they're<00:04:32.610> playing

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
you think the fact that they're playing

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.240 
you think the fact that they're playing
well<00:04:33.419> in<00:04:33.479> real<00:04:33.719> life<00:04:33.900> but<00:04:34.110> if<00:04:34.949> I<00:04:35.039> was<00:04:35.099> going

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
well in real life but if I was going

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.189 
well in real life but if I was going
like<00:04:35.490> as<00:04:35.789> a<00:04:35.819> building<00:04:36.330> it<00:04:36.389> just<00:04:36.629> as<00:04:36.750> a<00:04:36.780> squad<00:04:37.080> to

like as a building it just as a squad to
play<00:04:37.349> with<00:04:37.560> and<00:04:37.680> I<00:04:38.340> probably<00:04:38.610> a<00:04:38.729> chosen

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
play with and I probably a chosen

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.209 
play with and I probably a chosen
Flamini<00:04:39.569> and<00:04:39.780> Lucas<00:04:40.590> because<00:04:40.860> they<00:04:40.919> both<00:04:41.039> got
