the<00:02:42.500> larger<00:02:42.859> one<00:02:43.040> is<00:02:43.220> actually<00:02:43.880> on<00:02:44.030> the<00:02:44.180> front

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
the larger one is actually on the front

the larger one is actually on the front
side<00:02:44.690> like<00:02:44.930> a<00:02:44.959> traditional<00:02:45.620> machete<00:02:46.069> you<00:02:46.549> have

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
side like a traditional machete you have

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.670 
side like a traditional machete you have
the<00:02:46.910> same<00:02:47.209> rubberized<00:02:47.840> handle<00:02:48.139> coming

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
the same rubberized handle coming

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.780 
the same rubberized handle coming
through<00:02:48.859> on<00:02:49.010> this<00:02:49.130> one<00:02:49.280> it's<00:02:49.430> a<00:02:49.489> little<00:02:49.700> bit

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
through on this one it's a little bit

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.390 
through on this one it's a little bit
shorter<00:02:50.209> though<00:02:50.420> than<00:02:50.989> the<00:02:51.200> Gator<00:02:51.560> machete<00:02:52.069> so

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
shorter though than the Gator machete so

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.099 
shorter though than the Gator machete so
I'm<00:02:52.579> thinking<00:02:52.970> here<00:02:53.150> listen<00:02:53.480> if<00:02:53.569> I'm<00:02:53.690> battling

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:54.109 
I'm thinking here listen if I'm battling

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:56.440 
I'm thinking here listen if I'm battling
zombies<00:02:54.680> I<00:02:54.799> want<00:02:54.980> the<00:02:55.100> most<00:02:55.310> range<00:02:55.849> that<00:02:56.180> I<00:02:56.209> can

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
zombies I want the most range that I can

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.020 
zombies I want the most range that I can

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
bear grylls lineup for Gerber I really

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.300 
bear grylls lineup for Gerber I really
wish<00:03:23.540> that<00:03:23.570> it<00:03:23.930> matched<00:03:24.230> the<00:03:24.590> rest<00:03:24.800> of<00:03:24.980> the<00:03:25.040> set

in<00:03:25.490> terms<00:03:25.760> of<00:03:25.970> design<00:03:26.360> and<00:03:26.390> appearance<00:03:26.810> that

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
in terms of design and appearance that

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.780 
in terms of design and appearance that
being<00:03:27.560> said<00:03:27.770> this<00:03:27.920> is<00:03:27.980> my<00:03:28.190> second<00:03:28.640> favorite

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
being said this is my second favorite

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.360 
being said this is my second favorite
weapon<00:03:29.390> in<00:03:29.660> the<00:03:29.840> lineup<00:03:30.140> because<00:03:30.860> I'm<00:03:31.100> looking

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
weapon in the lineup because I'm looking

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.280 
weapon in the lineup because I'm looking
for<00:03:31.520> those<00:03:31.610> long-range<00:03:32.240> devices<00:03:32.780> as<00:03:32.930> I<00:03:33.050> said

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
for those long-range devices as I said

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.050 
for those long-range devices as I said
before<00:03:33.500> so<00:03:33.950> you<00:03:34.040> could<00:03:34.190> stay<00:03:34.430> away<00:03:34.700> from<00:03:34.760> all

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
before so you could stay away from all

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.720 
before so you could stay away from all
that<00:03:35.090> nasty<00:03:35.780> zombie<00:03:36.260> Ness<00:03:36.500> next<00:03:37.370> we<00:03:37.490> have

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
that nasty zombie Ness next we have

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.940 
that nasty zombie Ness next we have
probably<00:03:38.390> the<00:03:38.480> most<00:03:38.630> practical<00:03:39.320> knife<00:03:39.650> or

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
probably the most practical knife or

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.770 
probably the most practical knife or
second<00:03:40.310> most<00:03:40.430> practical<00:03:40.940> knife<00:03:41.090> in<00:03:41.390> the<00:03:41.510> setup

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
second most practical knife in the setup

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.680 
second most practical knife in the setup
this<00:03:42.410> is<00:03:42.530> the<00:03:42.650> LMF<00:03:43.100> to<00:03:43.400> infantry<00:03:44.090> which<00:03:44.240> is<00:03:44.480> a

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
this is the LMF to infantry which is a

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.500 
this is the LMF to infantry which is a
combat<00:03:45.260> blade<00:03:45.620> it's<00:03:46.220> really<00:03:46.790> weighted<00:03:47.240> quite

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
combat blade it's really weighted quite

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.780 
combat blade it's really weighted quite
nicely<00:03:47.840> and<00:03:48.320> it's<00:03:48.500> solid<00:03:48.890> this<00:03:49.310> thing<00:03:49.520> feels

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
nicely and it's solid this thing feels

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.480 
nicely and it's solid this thing feels
incredibly<00:03:50.360> strong<00:03:50.960> you<00:03:51.530> could<00:03:51.680> also<00:03:51.830> wrap<00:03:52.280> it

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:52.490 
incredibly strong you could also wrap it

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:54.250 
incredibly strong you could also wrap it
to<00:03:52.670> a<00:03:52.700> stick<00:03:53.060> and<00:03:53.300> turn<00:03:53.420> it<00:03:53.570> into<00:03:53.690> a<00:03:53.810> spear<00:03:54.230> or

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
to a stick and turn it into a spear or

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:55.450 
to a stick and turn it into a spear or
something<00:03:54.620> like<00:03:54.710> that<00:03:54.770> that's<00:03:55.010> why<00:03:55.160> you<00:03:55.220> have

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:55.460 
something like that that's why you have

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.430 
something like that that's why you have
those<00:03:55.700> two<00:03:55.940> little<00:03:56.240> holes<00:03:56.390> in<00:03:56.720> there<00:03:56.930> so<00:03:57.410> that

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
those two little holes in there so that

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.110 
those two little holes in there so that
you<00:03:57.560> could<00:03:57.770> tie<00:03:57.950> this<00:03:58.010> to<00:03:58.340> a<00:03:58.370> stick<00:03:58.640> if<00:03:58.790> need<00:03:59.090> be

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
you could tie this to a stick if need be

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.360 
you could tie this to a stick if need be
but<00:03:59.600> a<00:03:59.990> very<00:04:00.260> nice<00:04:00.470> knife<00:04:00.770> it<00:04:00.920> also<00:04:01.070> comes<00:04:01.280> with

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
but a very nice knife it also comes with

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.790 
but a very nice knife it also comes with
a<00:04:01.490> pretty<00:04:01.700> cool<00:04:01.910> case<00:04:02.240> but<00:04:02.960> it<00:04:03.020> isn't<00:04:03.290> foldable

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:03.800 
a pretty cool case but it isn't foldable

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.680 
a pretty cool case but it isn't foldable
or<00:04:03.920> anything<00:04:04.130> the<00:04:04.430> next<00:04:04.790> one<00:04:04.970> actually<00:04:05.480> is

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
or anything the next one actually is

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.620 
or anything the next one actually is
which<00:04:05.959> is<00:04:06.140> the<00:04:06.320> DMF<00:04:06.920> folder<00:04:07.880> it<00:04:08.270> also<00:04:08.420> has<00:04:08.600> a

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.630 
which is the DMF folder it also has a

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.650 
which is the DMF folder it also has a
clip<00:04:08.810> on<00:04:09.080> one<00:04:09.620> side<00:04:09.890> of<00:04:09.920> it<00:04:10.130> this<00:04:10.670> in<00:04:10.970> terms<00:04:11.480> of

clip on one side of it this in terms of

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.480 
clip on one side of it this in terms of
practicality<00:04:12.140> is<00:04:12.440> probably<00:04:13.070> the<00:04:13.280> most

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:13.490 
practicality is probably the most

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:15.280 
practicality is probably the most
practical<00:04:13.760> knife<00:04:14.180> in<00:04:14.390> the<00:04:14.480> setup<00:04:14.840> it<00:04:15.020> seems

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
practical knife in the setup it seems

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.050 
practical knife in the setup it seems
small<00:04:15.500> after<00:04:15.920> handling<00:04:16.549> all<00:04:16.760> the<00:04:16.910> other

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
small after handling all the other

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.909 
small after handling all the other
blades<00:04:17.390> in<00:04:17.630> this<00:04:17.780> kit<00:04:18.080> but<00:04:18.109> it's<00:04:18.470> actually

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:18.919 
blades in this kit but it's actually
