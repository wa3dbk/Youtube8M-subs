ball chain let's show you what it's
about<00:00:16.410> so<00:00:16.920> easy<00:00:17.900> method<00:00:18.900> to<00:00:19.050> fish<00:00:19.260> wire<00:00:19.670> along

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
about so easy method to fish wire along

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.029 
about so easy method to fish wire along
with<00:00:20.939> it<00:00:21.090> is<00:00:21.210> a<00:00:21.270> quite<00:00:21.900> flexible<00:00:22.140> handle<00:00:22.890> it

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
with it is a quite flexible handle it

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.189 
with it is a quite flexible handle it
has<00:00:23.279> a<00:00:23.310> magnet<00:00:23.789> on<00:00:23.880> it<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:24.210> reach<00:00:24.359> out<00:00:24.600> and<00:00:24.779> grab

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
ok with that now let's go in here and do

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.610 
ok with that now let's go in here and do
the<00:00:51.090> fact<00:00:51.329> we've<00:00:51.539> got<00:00:51.719> our<00:00:51.840> ball<00:00:52.079> chain<00:00:52.379> in

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
the fact we've got our ball chain in

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.020 
the fact we've got our ball chain in
we're<00:00:53.070> going<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.250> be<00:00:53.309> dealing<00:00:53.550> with<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.670> slab

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
we're going to be dealing with a slab

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.090 
we're going to be dealing with a slab
floor<00:00:54.300> in<00:00:54.570> this<00:00:54.719> instance<00:00:55.199> so<00:00:55.440> let's<00:00:55.649> pour

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
floor in this instance so let's pour

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.520 
floor in this instance so let's pour
molding<00:00:56.730> so<00:00:57.510> we'll<00:00:57.660> pour<00:00:57.899> holding<00:00:58.410> and

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
molding so we'll pour holding and

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.450 
drill a hole a drywall paper goes in and
when<00:01:55.020> you<00:01:55.170> try<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.409> pull<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:55.829> back<00:01:56.040> out<00:01:56.250> it

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
when you try to pull it back out it

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.520 
when you try to pull it back out it
closes<00:01:56.909> up<00:01:56.939> on<00:01:57.240> it<00:01:57.360> because<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.810> backpaper

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
closes up on it because the backpaper

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.730 
closes up on it because the backpaper
tears<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.880> of<00:02:00.810> course<00:02:01.049> it<00:02:01.229> doesn't<00:02:01.409> throw<00:02:01.710> up

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
tears and of course it doesn't throw up

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:02.950 
tears and of course it doesn't throw up
clean

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
clean

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.630

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
therefore you have to use a little

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.160 
therefore you have to use a little
retriever<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:06.210> bring<00:02:06.390> it<00:02:06.509> in<00:02:06.630> now<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:06.930> nice
