00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 hello everyone today I bring you a tutorial 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.919
 how to make sprite animations in 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.200
 sony vegas materials we just need 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.840
 the photoshop no matter what version 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.150
 have the sprites in the description them 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.460
 I will leave a page of sprites so that 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.480
 look for those who need and finally 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.270
 the sony vegas 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.410
 obviously xd good that's all 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.420
 let's start with the tutorial 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.660
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:32.689
 open the photoshop i will use the cs 4 i think 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.460
 that the version does not matter now we are looking for 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.410
 the spirits and we drag them to 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.079
 photoshop 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.820
 once we have the image we will have to 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:44.830
 choose the action that we want the 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.830
 character do I choose this one 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.390
 now we select the tool 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.160
 draft of funds and we put ourselves to 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.640
 eliminate things that are not of 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.640
 spirit 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.759
 well now we choose the tool 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.310
 selection and we select the first 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:14.259
 sprint then we press control more on 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.659
 the keyboard so that the esprit is copied 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:18.430
 now we press control + ny 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:20.829
 a window will automatically appear 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.500
 to make a new image we do not change 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:25.990
 nothing and we give ok in the new space 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.789
 blank we press control + by then 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.789
 we removed the bottom layer 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.430
 the next thing will be to choose the tool 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.530
 to cut and select all the 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.510
 image and then we stretch the square 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.150
 to make it bigger in case of 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:46.430
 following sad 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.410
 now comes something a bit boring 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.420
 we will have to copy the other sprite is 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:53.320
 one by one and paste them into the image of the 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.320
 individual spirit 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.979
 Once done, we unchecked all 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.750
 images minus the first one now we should 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.849
 accommodate the spirits so that all 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.800
 are in the right place for this 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:15.989
 we mark a box and then 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.060
 we select the layer followed by that 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.970
 we press master control so that 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.860
 we can move the image a tip 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.140
 I recommend that when they go to move the 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.120
 image press shift so that 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:31.700
 always be framed if you are not three 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.700
 hours trying to put them where they go xd 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.860
 now we uncheck all the images 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.620
 minus the first one now comes what 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.730
 interesting we go to windows or window and 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.069
 we press animation 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:55.349
 This window will appear where 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:55.349
 we will put the speed in 0 1 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.090
 now we copy the frame we uncheck 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.370
 the first image and we mark the second 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.620
 we copy it again, we demarcate the 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:08.510
 second and we mark the third one and we do 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.510
 that until having all the images 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.120
 if you want they can reproduce it below 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.950
 signs appear as if it were a 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.980
 player I do not think I have to 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.410
 teach them how to use that xd well already almost 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.330
 we finish now we just need to save it 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.870
 for that we have to give a file 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:33.269
 save for web and devices 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:36.890
 here we just have to change this bit 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:36.890
 and then we give to save 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.750
 We put the name you want and you 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.420
 we give to save 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:48.640
 now we open our sony vegas I use 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.640
 the 10 does not matter which version they have 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.510
 Now just drag the hiv of 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:57.160
 character until the sony vegas and if 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.160
 they want they can put a fund 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:09.100
 and well that was all goodbye friends and we 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.100
 we see in another video
