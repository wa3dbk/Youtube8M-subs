00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.280
 new people know each other here 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.929
 more gameplay comments and indeed 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.400
 today the game is on the plan what 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.289
 you all wished you and indeed 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.609
 even before two i have so many fans 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.680
 I should get it once again 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.760
 still 2 comments like bring and there 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.080
 I'm getting up to the end again 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.689
 I have brought black air 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.869
 thought then bring because again before 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.660
 two and yes today I have one here 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.360
 little team the man later vector 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.649
 plays and the whole thing gets in one 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.480
 team deathmatch risen 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.430
 I have all the statements on the weapon 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.170
 the charlie my graduation her 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.120
 should be here as you can see on the 3d the 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.670
 Drones are on the 7 because Harry and 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.010
 on the new the tableaux one hears 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.489
 should pay per firepower or 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.800
 hardliner 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.329
 I have the dead at 3 so firepower 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.870
 and as a third work I have 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:01.620
 I never believe in it and today goes 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:04.140
 It's about the topic I'm thinking of the modern 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.000
 warfare series have to complain and that 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.909
 is really a point I have in each one 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.189
 part of infinity ward or general 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.720
 the engine for series have to complain 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.670
 in short here was already available 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.890
 even if not quite as strong but it 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.140
 was there and there it has me 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.610
 already pissed off times say and me 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.560
 think that's easy in the games of 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.400
 28 not available and I am too 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.020
 so rather the cd player of the on 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.670
 the games of two quartet like him 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.700
 certainly have learned by now 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.680
 and that's why I think of importing 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.600
 Do not play that much I find them 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.549
 because sometimes still good somebody now 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.799
 throwers and may well be fine 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.740
 before three is now also on 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.420
 but at the beginning a complete collapse 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.909
 but escaped was not at all 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.740
 Nevertheless , we come to it now 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.560
 the topic is the weapons 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.930
 yes, just these weapons on this 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.399
 balance the piss exaggerated 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.439
 if we are now, for example, first 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.990
 black ops pick because he says many people 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.130
 The weapons are boring because they all 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.110
 to play the same 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.850
 I have to say I think I have one too 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.680
 big differences from the pharma sa like that 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.819
 I do not really think the dice 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.620
 same and anyway 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:13.749
 but they both have the same 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:17.859
 Strengthen and see at no distance 

00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:19.180
 weak and yes good complain about that 

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:21.040
 Now I think it's good, I think so 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.319
 good that no matter where you are on the map 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.599
 with no weapon in the big advantage 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:27.969
 also apart from now second course 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:30.549
 on very large maps or pump guns on 

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:32.409
 I have no weapon in very tight spaces 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:34.450
 a disadvantage to any distance 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:36.129
 Clearly small differences are present 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.010
 but they are not all that big yes 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:41.319
 I can find it on any mpr 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.209
 map somehow play as well as with 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.939
 a farce and as well as man has easy 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.980
 no big disadvantages and I think so 

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:49.900
 it only takes a lot for two series 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:54.579
 crass if we for example ump 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:57.189
 this hardly increases from near distance 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:58.599
 killen quasi or the fun in close combat 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:01.359
 Ehlert is bad 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:02.769
 or we take now like the farmers 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:03.939
 or the part on the stars 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:06.639
 are exaggerated good 

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:08.889
 yes it is somehow that way 

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:11.650
 at some point in a gameplay always on 

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:14.019
 a place of the maple drink quasi on 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.250
 his weapon is not that good and 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.689
 then the player wins with the 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.009
 better weapons for example if I am 

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:20.109
 now crowded in here 

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:21.189
 must have fun with me opponents 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:23.500
 a vector or almost 

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:25.060
 impossible or turned around with someone 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.799
 natal I have to against my vector 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.569
 Two meters enforce that is impossible 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.699
 for the quasi I like them 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:32.530
 always the feeling that in mono before two 

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:34.959
 the player with the best weapon for the 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.250
 best situation he wins and not the 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.409
 player as it should be 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.840
 the best in general is yes but 

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:45.310
 the one with the best weapon for the 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:47.139
 momentary comfort 20 and I think so 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.819
 it is also minimal in black ops 

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:52.419
 but not so strong 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:54.069
 while forcing him was not so and 

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:57.280
 I think it's a pity that you can 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:59.139
 always in a situation device where 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.209
 one has almost the card by 

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:03.189
 his weapon and then what has me 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:05.709
 generally distributed to all apartments 

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:06.639
 until disturbed and yes you can go in 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:08.650
 to write the comments 

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:09.909
 if you could agree with us if we did 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.650
 also the differences between the 

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:14.919
 individual weapons to powerful place in the 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:16.599
 distribute motto or tell yourself that 

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:18.370
 principle of play offs is but 

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:20.079
 boring and i find that resident 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.340
 I would be interested in improving myself 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:24.080
 as the community thinks so 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.210
 the gameplay is already as good as 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.860
 I hope you liked it and me 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.780
 Hope the topic has caught your attention 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.040
 if you can you in commentary there 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.690
 let's say your opinion 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.070
 Express and thumb up 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.320
 whoever nice that helps of course 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:38.060
 I know what to do next and no 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:43.490
 no money or as some claim 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:45.650
 and yes the enzo here should be a 35 1 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:48.139
 are then always so easy in mono 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.639
 was a game with so few dead too 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:50.210
 So I play a bit for that 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:51.740
 heavy 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.370
 but anyway, up to six times 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.370
 look at people
