00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:09.490
 Hi everyone always moving and Homepage 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:13.210
 Thank you see the tell the guitar of know-how 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:15.170
 This guitar course is how to use kapotasto 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.930
 This time 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:21.820
 Kedomo use 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:23.500
 The way you put on that 8 captoss is about to turn it into that dvd 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.720
 youtube videos 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.200
 after 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:31.480
 I agree 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:35.540
 Though I think you know roughly look but it is that image photo that 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:39.280
 This type of scissors to Fu say this time 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.280
 Wear across 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:49.920
 Bring the larger one to the fret 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:52.590
 I think there is a question about what kind of time to use it then 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:59.760
 Well, those beginners are 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:01:02.910
 High that terribly needs when it is the 8 Well that, for example, playing talking 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.180
 I think it is such a tool 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.410
 For example, does a code of c 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.410
 Batoshi Masu singing song 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:21.440
 Of in very much that myself and singing that for a moment that's code of the c-yourself 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.750
 When I say I wish a little low to take to the voice of the range 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.280
 that 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:29.330
 1 fret if it was semitone 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:33.530
 2 frets if you want to raise the city 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:37.290
 If you think that I would like to give Ishion version 3 frets 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:43.940
 By placing it at 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.940
 Listen and say about the 4 high scales but sing on the high scales 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.159
 Do not hold the same code, for example 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.520
 Hmmm 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.520
 Yup 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:59.160
 Would you like a melody how to say 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.160
 But 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:05.070
 For example, putting the capo on the 3rd fret would suppress the same action 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:13.630
 You will be able to sing on a high scale 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:17.320
 This is together with any action is not limited to the code of the c 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:21.130
 For example , if you get used to the guitar to some extent 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:23.160
 I will also talk about that c , but c 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.160
 Hmm 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.940
 Sing 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.290
 That's a bit too low to say that I want to go high 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.640
 It is good 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:38.030
 The Fu Tteyuu Toka I Te Iinishi that 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:42.350
 That Toka or write the code itself in the head 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.540
 It can be said that it is written out like when copying the ear, but at first 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.690
 Also why 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:52.030
 I would like to rely on that capotast 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:54.690
 I think that is the feeling I also attracted melody with that guitar besides that 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.690
 If you 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:03.670
 I can not play the melody to the feeling that something is said that it is not the back of the child 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:05.350
 Also uses this capo as for many times its advanced when called 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:09.850
 Because 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:12.060
 Those who can listen to acoustic guitar or yes electric guitar 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.950
 Those who attracted the caster 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.540
 Anything that 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:22.440
 There is a case that capto strike is used 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:26.830
 Out to say you have the electric guitar be in something that telecaster 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:29.740
 Although there is an image of the station guitar company 's tasteful thing- 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:30.970
 In the saying of the electric guitar 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.810
 Hmm 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:37.490
 There are a lot of cases called hiku 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:40.970
 At that time I would like to draw a little more melodious 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:43.560
 I say I finger ring to play in that finger ring finger 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:50.160
 Melodious with finger ring 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:52.750
 This is because it brings out various nuances when you want to live softly 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.060
 Use tools 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:04:00.370
 It will be said that 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:01.640
 Various usages come out depending on the degree of progress, and such guitar related 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:05.540
 tool 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:09.920
 Use of the thing and also 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:11.930
 I mean is given to real interesting that Tsu guitar becoming more and more unusual is because agenda of initiatives 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:15.500
 Gradually gradually that I say I wish 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:19.530
 I think Fu it 's such a coming together found to that progress 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:21.410
 Try to play the guitar in various code in the I 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.380
 That various keys 0 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:29.150
 Try to play the melody that 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:33.260
 So I wonder if I will be attracted to the lgiter man later and the scale of the sentence 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:37.280
 Say so but I think that that pentatonic is learn to Tteyuu if Toka 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:43.090
 That guitar chord a little difficult while learning 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:48.100
 Toka that is a flat 5 Toka that major 7 Toka that 9th 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:48.580
 I thought that it would be better if I learned that code of that kind of code 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.660
 I will 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:57.000
 Although a little story was it a side street 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:59.889
 That guitar is such a deep instrument as you really do it 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.830
 Not only the guitar but musical instruments and I'm anything that so 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:07.330
 That that say 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:14.580
 I hope you will enjoy it later and feel it 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:14.580
 Thank you for watching this time was about how to use Capo Tast
