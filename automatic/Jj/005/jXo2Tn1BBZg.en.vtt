don't<00:01:49.479> want<00:01:49.659> to<00:01:49.719> over<00:01:50.020> exfoliate<00:01:50.229> your<00:01:50.740> skin

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 
don't want to over exfoliate your skin

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:54.959 
don't want to over exfoliate your skin
right<00:01:51.520> and<00:01:52.649> again<00:01:53.649> with<00:01:54.009> the<00:01:54.249> moisturizing

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:54.969 
right and again with the moisturizing

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:56.130 
right and again with the moisturizing
mask<00:01:55.119> you<00:01:55.359> have<00:01:55.539> you<00:01:55.630> could<00:01:55.810> use<00:01:55.960> those<00:01:56.079> a

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
mask you have you could use those a

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.959 
mask you have you could use those a
couple<00:01:56.380> of<00:01:56.590> times<00:01:56.799> a<00:01:56.950> week<00:01:56.979> because<00:01:57.670> it<00:01:57.789> won't

00:01:57.959 --> 00:01:57.969 
couple of times a week because it won't

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:59.399 
couple of times a week because it won't
damage<00:01:58.359> the<00:01:58.539> skin<00:01:58.840> anyway<00:01:59.140> because<00:01:59.319> you're

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
damage the skin anyway because you're

00:01:59.409 --> 00:01:59.990 
damage the skin anyway because you're
not<00:01:59.469> going<00:01:59.619> to<00:01:59.679> be

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
not going to be

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.670 
not going to be
exfoliating<00:02:00.870> so<00:02:01.110> they're<00:02:01.260> good<00:02:01.410> to<00:02:01.530> use<00:02:01.620> a

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
exfoliating so they're good to use a

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.950 
exfoliating so they're good to use a
couple<00:02:01.920> of<00:02:02.040> times<00:02:02.220> a<00:02:02.430> week<00:02:02.720> maybe<00:02:03.720> the

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
couple of times a week maybe the

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.050 
couple of times a week maybe the
beginning<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.440> end<00:02:04.620> of<00:02:04.800> a<00:02:04.890> week<00:02:05.100> what<00:02:05.940> would

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
beginning and end of a week what would

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.640 
beginning and end of a week what would
be<00:02:06.150> the<00:02:06.270> difference<00:02:06.630> between<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.260> really

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650 
be the difference between a really

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.770 
be the difference between a really
intense<00:02:08.250> moisture<00:02:08.700> mask<00:02:08.880> like<00:02:09.119> that<00:02:09.330> one<00:02:09.539> and

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
intense moisture mask like that one and

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.540 
intense moisture mask like that one and
just<00:02:10.470> putting<00:02:10.950> on<00:02:11.039> a<00:02:11.070> really<00:02:11.370> rich

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
just putting on a really rich

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.250 
just putting on a really rich
moisturizer<00:02:12.120> is<00:02:12.390> there<00:02:12.540> a<00:02:12.570> difference

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
moisturizer is there a difference

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.890 
moisturizer is there a difference
the<00:02:13.860> masks<00:02:14.580> have<00:02:14.730> a<00:02:14.760> higher<00:02:14.940> concentration<00:02:15.780> of

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
the masks have a higher concentration of

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.540 
the masks have a higher concentration of
the<00:02:16.110> moisture<00:02:16.650> and<00:02:16.680> widgets<00:02:17.040> in<00:02:17.220> there<00:02:17.400> so

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
the moisture and widgets in there so

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.400 
the moisture and widgets in there so
that<00:02:17.580> all<00:02:17.790> yours<00:02:18.030> or<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:18.600> fruit<00:02:18.840> acids<00:02:19.200> in

on for about 20 minutes and then take
off<00:02:43.260> that<00:02:43.500> warmth<00:02:43.920> now<00:02:44.100> I<00:02:44.370> suppose<00:02:44.790> you

off that warmth now I suppose you

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.780 
off that warmth now I suppose you
wouldn't<00:02:45.150> want<00:02:45.270> to<00:02:45.300> be<00:02:49.550> probably<00:02:50.550> wouldn't

because<00:02:53.040> us<00:02:53.190> so<00:02:53.640> much<00:02:53.850> isn't<00:02:54.120> that<00:02:54.300> instead<00:02:54.720> of

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
because us so much isn't that instead of

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.150 
because us so much isn't that instead of
your<00:02:55.080> exfoliator

your exfoliator

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
but with the moisture mask and I think I

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.740 
but with the moisture mask and I think I
sometimes<00:02:59.400> get<00:02:59.670> confused<00:02:59.790> with<00:03:00.239> this<00:03:00.390> because

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
sometimes get confused with this because

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.930 
sometimes get confused with this because
some<00:03:01.260> facials<00:03:01.650> you<00:03:01.770> go<00:03:01.890> for<00:03:02.130> they<00:03:02.310> exfoliate

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
some facials you go for they exfoliate

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.699 
some facials you go for they exfoliate
they<00:03:03.060> cleanse<00:03:03.360> exfoliate<00:03:03.570> them<00:03:04.230> do<00:03:04.410> a<00:03:04.440> mask

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
sometimes it's the other way around what

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.690 
sometimes it's the other way around what
what<00:03:07.290> kind<00:03:07.530> of<00:03:07.590> authorship<00:03:07.920> would<00:03:08.220> be<00:03:08.370> doing

what kind of authorship would be doing

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.850 
what kind of authorship would be doing
things<00:03:08.910> in<00:03:09.239> I<00:03:09.450> always<00:03:10.170> think<00:03:10.380> it's<00:03:10.530> best<00:03:10.739> to

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
things in I always think it's best to

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.160 
things in I always think it's best to

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
generally if someone's got dry skin

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.610 
generally if someone's got dry skin
they're<00:03:45.209> going<00:03:45.360> to<00:03:45.420> need<00:03:45.660> as<00:03:45.930> much<00:03:46.350> moisture

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
they're going to need as much moisture

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.319 
they're going to need as much moisture
as<00:03:46.890> they<00:03:46.980> can<00:03:47.190> get<00:03:47.280> on<00:03:47.400> the<00:03:47.489> skin<00:03:47.730> anyway<00:03:48.060> and

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
as they can get on the skin anyway and

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:49.819 
as they can get on the skin anyway and
with<00:03:48.480> the<00:03:48.600> bomb<00:03:48.780> we're<00:03:49.110> going<00:03:49.260> to<00:03:49.320> be<00:03:49.410> taking

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
with the bomb we're going to be taking

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:51.680 
with the bomb we're going to be taking
that<00:03:49.980> off<00:03:50.130> after<00:03:50.459> we<00:03:50.850> cleanse<00:03:51.120> so<00:03:51.450> we're<00:03:51.570> not

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
that off after we cleanse so we're not

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.080 
that off after we cleanse so we're not
leaving<00:03:52.049> on<00:03:52.170> the<00:03:52.320> skin<00:03:52.620> so<00:03:53.250> it'd<00:03:53.579> be<00:03:53.760> good<00:03:53.910> to

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
leaving on the skin so it'd be good to

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.940 
leaving on the skin so it'd be good to
use<00:03:54.269> a<00:03:54.299> bomb<00:03:54.630> and<00:03:54.989> the<00:03:55.230> hydrating<00:03:55.769> mask
