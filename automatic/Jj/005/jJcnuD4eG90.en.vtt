 the evolution of the human being through technology 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.289
 the human being

 evolution of the human race 

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.810
 has been in charge of logical mathematical ethical thought processes 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:38.450
 have ready 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.380
 there would be right will be awarded is owned by this mandatory type

 and with the creative part in all the fields 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.610
 men of the current generation are called to develop and 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.380
 stimulate this mystery 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.120
 evolution has begun to learn about technology as a prolongation of the 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:58.950
 senses 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.880
 changing the way we perceive what surrounds us

 yes conquest 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.950
 even how it is created in the artistic medium 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.860
 more and more children are moving away from children's games that require 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.520
 movement and stimulates your brain learn faster reason 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.520
 perceive and contribute the learning processes 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.050
 it would be worth it in all these subjects 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.860
 educational models must be changed and traditional models presented 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.520
 is currently being developed with a perception and sensitive 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.660
 the music of the perception that these 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.510
 the visual and auditory are inextricably linked 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.460
 to perceive reality 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.370
 not in vain the audiovisual language is talking more than writing 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.660
 but there is more to read 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.660
 feel more than understands 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.320
 the evolution gets faster every day 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.780
 that such a way that fair people are expected soon 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.760
 communications in which they intervene 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.250
 more senses 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.559
 children for example 

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:13.819
 they are looking more and more for interactivity in the contents and looking for it 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.819
 information in them is growing even more than adults 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:22.540
 with it the stimuli of the right hemisphere the human being 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.259
 they are different generations 

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:30.369
 printing creativity and space solutions ninety years 

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:33.499
 they are still present 

00:02:33.499 --> 00:02:36.979
 now in the new ways of getting 

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:39.309
 with the audiovisual language of multimedia 

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:42.309
 television integrating images and sound 

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:46.149
 his teaching style that narration 

00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:51.329
 they show concrete situations contributing knowledge by what is seen is to say 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:56.289
 it has been a promise of the senses a man who evolved his feeling 

00:02:56.289 --> 00:03:01.209
 that is expected not only that learns communicate better but that it is more 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.549
 creative artistic and spiritual
