00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.970
 what the biome wanted did not know that the biome 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.700
 there's no one you know what a biome is 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.620
 explain to me what a biome is 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.630
 listening is this is a community climax 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.670
 the terrestrial environment community 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.949
 ipn musician climax 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.020
 obviously these communities to climax 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.720
 throughout the world vary widely 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.269
 now what is more important the enem is the 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.160
 Brazil a country of shit biodiversity 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.449
 As Brazil does not make sense to charge a 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.550
 no vestibular test 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.380
 tells me is on the taiga to talk 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.719
 me on the tundra so let's leave 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.520
 this side and we will focus on the 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.710
 main Brazilian biomes 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.530
 first we have amazon and 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.360
 Atlantic forest that both have the highest 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.219
 biodiversity on the planet one 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.879
 one high biodiversity 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:50.280
 vertical vegetation stratification 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:52.500
 Herb shrub trees and a large 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.850
 amount of epiphytic plants that live 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.090
 about other plants 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.980
 aiming to achieve more light in the 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.140
 Atlantic forest in particular is very 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.719
 important that you understand that some 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.970
 organisms are endemic ie they are 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:10.010
 species that only live live 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.240
 exclusively in closed Atlantic cream 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.610
 closed it is considered one of the 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.189
 biodiversity hotspots by the 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.080
 a year because because the cerrado does not 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.770
 diversity as high as 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.689
 amazon 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.119
 only he is very much threatened 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.580
 threatened mainly by the increase in 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.409
 livestock and also of agricultural areas 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.650
 as is the case of soybean, the main 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.869
 characteristics of cerrado her plants 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:36.600
 with adaptations to drought and 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.189
 extremely acid and poor soil 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.979
 going to the northeast we have the caatinga 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.729
 with its adapted xerophilic plants 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.950
 drought with thorns with deep roots 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.720
 in the wax layer on the leaves and 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.090
 too much for the central ones if people 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.880
 the wetland is a floodable area 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.729
 there was a very clear seasonality of 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.610
 rains and droughts and to the south 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.110
 we have the pampas the pampas the 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.630
 araucaria with characteristics also 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.729
 peculiar to araucaria having 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.770
 prevalence of araucaria angustifolia and 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.869
 pampas with predominance of grasses and 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.569
 high productivity 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.069
 to learn more please summary 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.909
 issues for 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.909
 I can do well at enem
