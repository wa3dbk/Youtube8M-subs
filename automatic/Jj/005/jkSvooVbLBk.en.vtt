00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.910
 because today I am going to clarify a 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:09.389
 doubt that many of us have had with the 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.040
 Nokia Lumia with the alumina block 610 or 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.700
 any of the models that could 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.699
 have because you can not share things 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.730
 by bluetooth because you can not do 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.010
 ringtones on your cell phone that are songs from 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.630
 good tones I have a good one 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.570
 answer today if you can 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.480
 do but good that has comes first 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.929
 What I would have to do is get into the 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.929
 store 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.720
 to the brand that you have to put in 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.530
 marketplace 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.530
 in the back 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.750
 once there inside 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.750
 you are going to give where it says look 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:05.060
 There is a tool to share 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.060
 by bluetooth called sharing 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.010
 by favorite bluetooth I will appear 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:16.399
 it is up to the top we can check 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.890
 you have to download it in this case I do not 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:22.429
 I'm going to download it because I already have 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.620
 downloaded but with this application you go 

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:27.550
 to be able to share 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:30.550
 some some files that you want 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.550
 share 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:36.580
 and good in the case of music 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.409
 that you want to put it as a tone 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.869
 you also have to download 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:44.229
 a software that is called creator of 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:44.229
 tones 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.290
 a program called creator of 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.290
 tones 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.880
 is this one here, we can not 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:06.479
 observe says tone creator 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.759
 you have to download it and later 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.869
 Well, we already have our applications in 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.500
 this case because I already have them 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.500

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:20.940
 we have here share by bluetooth 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.940
 it's a show this from the nokia lumia 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.880
 Well, we have this open 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.700
 now to share what you have 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.560
 to decide to share in this case 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.060
 that you want to send something could 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.020
 select this file 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.020
 on an image 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:05.690
 this I will select some image that 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.690
 I could want to convert 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.350
 you are already selecting it 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.010
 and we're going to give you one of those that already 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.900
 let's have some of the groups that 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.510
 we have configured or in this case yes 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.569
 that will help you in others 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:29.019
 and all the cells that are activated 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:30.940
 and good will ask for the password worth 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:34.410
 let's go in the following 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.410
 the tone maker 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.250
 is this min 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.180
 but some are so that they can 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.409

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.409
 creator of tomás 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:47.499
 I'm going in 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:04.170
 and well, here I am going to choose a song 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.170
 where it says choose a song 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.040

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.449
 many times it happened to me that I was 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:44.970
 to look for it and could not find the answer 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:47.690
 even on youtube in the answers not 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:50.039

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.350

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:09.270
 and then here we can put this time the 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.270
 we want 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:13.040
 this is how the tone will sound 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:19.949
 simply this valued in 1 second and 

00:05:17.999 --> 00:05:21.900
 it does not allow you anymore you can not lengthen 

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:25.110
 up here 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:27.770

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.770
