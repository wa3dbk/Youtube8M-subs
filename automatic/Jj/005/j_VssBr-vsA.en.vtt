00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
which is located right here I have tried

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.580 
which is located right here I have tried
many<00:03:00.209> different<00:03:00.630> ways<00:03:00.810> of<00:03:01.200> removing<00:03:01.829> the<00:03:03.590> the

many different ways of removing the the
dog<00:03:04.829> bone<00:03:05.160> I<00:03:05.880> think<00:03:06.660> this<00:03:06.870> one<00:03:07.140> is<00:03:07.380> probably

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
dog bone I think this one is probably

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.069 
dog bone I think this one is probably
the<00:03:07.799> easiest<00:03:08.269> first<00:03:09.269> thing<00:03:09.510> you<00:03:09.600> need<00:03:09.750> to<00:03:09.810> do

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
the easiest first thing you need to do

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:13.009 
the easiest first thing you need to do
is<00:03:10.260> actually<00:03:10.470> remove<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.459> screw<00:03:11.880> that<00:03:12.209> joins

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
is actually remove the screw that joins

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:21.360 
is actually remove the screw that joins
your<00:03:13.970> apart<00:03:14.970> suspension<00:03:15.870> arm<00:03:16.610> here

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.229 

you

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:35.210 

remove<00:03:25.239> it<00:03:25.450> out<00:03:25.569> completely

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220
