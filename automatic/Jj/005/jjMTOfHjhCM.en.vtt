00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 hello I 'm simon had to do 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.520
 this video is still about the 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.370
 difference from set corners crawl 100 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.040
 percent protein in the blue can and 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.440
 the citeq nutrition 100 percent whey 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.480
 protein professional here in the red 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.310
 Can you ask yourself, of course, at it 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.150
 are relatively similar to both from 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.130
 same manufacturer 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.330
 where is the difference I mean 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.769
 first difference is already 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.390
 apparently the color of 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.310
 but of course it's not all 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.810
 you can certainly imagine 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.609
 that we have the whole thing in this 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.250
 video a bit more detailed yes 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.350
 both whey proteins so whey proteins 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.059
 they are of course very high quality and 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.649
 they taste the same with the rest 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.760
 really above average good can 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.989
 I think so too 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.550
 and there is only really one 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.079
 few people who contradict me now 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.789
 would be the tasteful already 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.649
 simply by one of the best products 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.570
 that's just the way it is 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.879
 Variety of flavors are 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.289
 both very diverse so both in 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.699
 the blue box as well as in the red 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.780
 There are many 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.670
 flavors 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.930
 but and that is the second difference 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.000
 It is noticeable that it is not 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.469
 there are intersections but there are 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.719
 many flavors here 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.220
 There are many flavors 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:07.260
 partly on crazy combination and 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.479
 what exotic when this white 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.880
 chocolate flavor that now nothing quite 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.159
 exotic java caramel where it too 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.320
 something very different from berry and 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.119
 vanilla cinnamon and vanilla burned 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.159
 almonds and his stuff in total 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.170
 In any case, very tasty treats 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.939
 very diverse tastes 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.350
 but as far as the tastes are concerned 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.520
 You have to be if you are for example 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.530
 say you want this or that 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.000
 taste already between the products 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.320
 that means you do not have there 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.780
 more the choice namely the blue box 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.340
 or namely the red pants because just the 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.689
 taste no common 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.400
 Cut quantity therefore have that 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.009
 maybe another quite interesting so 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.360
 to mention so this color of the box 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.560
 the tastes are that 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.880
 actually rather the externalities 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.439
 now we come to the inner 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.600
 that's what they really value 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.759
 importantly, both are whey proteins 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.590
 So because there are new proteins as far as it goes 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.750
 this is open reiners new protein 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.119
 concentrate and have concentrated here 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.280
 We make new protein concentrates with one 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.049
 isolat mixed so of value 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.390
 this is a little bit better 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.009
 because it is precisely this isolate that is 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.759
 Of course , everything is reflected more 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.140
 will be back 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.850
 So here's the share 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.250
 carbohydrates in the blue can 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.720
 a little bit higher, though relatively 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.130
 insignificantly higher and not 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.790
 Above average, very important 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.620
 at the place 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.570
 but here is perhaps just a little 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.110
 lower with the protein content is too 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.520
 even higher 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.590
 not just that in here 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.540
 isola is included and therefore easy 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.010
 So less lactose contained 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.200
 Overall, it was really great 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.690
 products in both of these parents still too 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.730
 sometimes as an individual as a free amino acid 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.440
 added here the red pink yet 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.960
 a bit of leucine was also added 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.030
 became some theory and in both one 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.830
 Small amount of dextrose easy for this 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.250
 sweet for just this round 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.960
 taste 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.190
 I think that's exactly what it is 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.420
 Also the buyer of this protein 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.520
 So just guess unlikely 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.870
 good taste has indeed underlined 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.000
 They are definitely because it is great 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.100
 No one is the relevant difference 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.080
 that here the proteins share small 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.640
 a little higher is that we have the quality 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.290
 In my opinion, that's what I say 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.670
 just like it is a little bit 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.110
 better than here you have one 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.420
 outstanding taste too 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.160
 Real super good white quality too 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.420
 You can not leave anything to that, but here 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.520
 is that just a little tick 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.750
 better overall, I would still if 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.800
 I kinda taste now 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.780
 necessarily want to have to 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.520
 example white chocolate by me 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.080
 just buy the two the blue box 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.090
 That's not a big problem 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.380
 So overall, you should get away from it 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.450
 Do not let it stop you if you just 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.100
 For example, white chocolate is like 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.940
 then you can also drink I just 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.680
 in this form 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.640
 so these are the three differences and 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.650
 then of course there are consequences 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.360
 confusion even just the green dose 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.920
 the difference is her whole again 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.770
 it is clear in the green dose 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.690
 100% isolate is exactly what's here 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.470
 Proportionally it is here in pure 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.240
 form included 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.040
 the price of the only insignificant 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.870
 higher at line with the price here 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.940
 the same is what you think, however 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.760
 must be that here only 2000 grams in it 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.710
 and here are 2350 as well as here 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.630
 So here you have something more 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:53.550
 content even if the cans all three 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.380
 are the same size I hope I could 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.940
 now a little light in the dark 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.410
 I bring my obvious 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.840
 difference the color of the packaging needs 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.880
 it but the inner values that count one 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.680
 not only at the partneruche but 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:08.840
 Also with the protein purchase we see ourselves in the 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.840
 next video many greetings at simon
