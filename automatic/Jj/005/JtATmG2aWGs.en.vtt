okay<00:00:10.380> I'm<00:00:10.470> going<00:00:10.590> to<00:00:10.680> show<00:00:10.830> a<00:00:10.860> couple<00:00:11.070> of<00:00:11.280> quick

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:11.520 
okay I'm going to show a couple of quick

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.280 
okay I'm going to show a couple of quick
taping<00:00:12.030> techniques<00:00:12.480> here<00:00:12.690> one<00:00:12.870> for<00:00:13.020> the<00:00:13.080> elbow

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
taping techniques here one for the elbow

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.160 
taping techniques here one for the elbow
and<00:00:13.500> one<00:00:13.650> for<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:13.890> wrist<00:00:15.049> generally<00:00:16.049> this

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
and one for the wrist generally this

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.019 
and one for the wrist generally this
works<00:00:16.440> well<00:00:16.710> for<00:00:16.740> people<00:00:17.220> who<00:00:17.369> have<00:00:17.610> at<00:00:17.880> the

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
works well for people who have at the

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.840 
works well for people who have at the
elbow<00:00:18.300> pain<00:00:18.540> with<00:00:18.750> either<00:00:19.730> flexing<00:00:20.730> or

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
elbow pain with either flexing or

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.120 
elbow pain with either flexing or
extending<00:00:21.240> their<00:00:21.360> elbow<00:00:21.690> flexing<00:00:22.560> or

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
extending their elbow flexing or

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.249 
extending their elbow flexing or
extending<00:00:23.640> their<00:00:23.760> elbow<00:00:24.119> or<00:00:24.570> with<00:00:24.960> certain

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:25.259 
extending their elbow or with certain

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:27.679 
extending their elbow or with certain
hand<00:00:25.439> motions<00:00:25.830> like<00:00:25.980> maybe<00:00:26.220> gripping<00:00:26.700> so<00:00:27.660> a

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
hand motions like maybe gripping so a

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.050 
hand motions like maybe gripping so a
good<00:00:27.930> test<00:00:28.259> to<00:00:28.410> do<00:00:28.500> beforehand<00:00:29.160> is<00:00:29.730> to<00:00:29.910> have

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
good test to do beforehand is to have

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.730 
good test to do beforehand is to have
them<00:00:30.270> do<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.660> painful<00:00:31.050> motion<00:00:31.349> go<00:00:31.470> ahead<00:00:31.619> and

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
them do the painful motion go ahead and

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.350 
them do the painful motion go ahead and
groove<00:00:31.890> there<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.730> then<00:00:32.850> I'm<00:00:32.970> going<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.150> just

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
groove there and then I'm going to just

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.750 
groove there and then I'm going to just
kind<00:00:33.510> of<00:00:33.570> press<00:00:33.870> inward<00:00:34.170> with<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.250> upper<00:00:35.520> hand

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
kind of press inward with the upper hand

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.940 
kind of press inward with the upper hand
and<00:00:36.290> pressing<00:00:37.290> this<00:00:37.380> way<00:00:37.530> with<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.739> upper

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
and pressing this way with the upper

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.680 
and pressing this way with the upper
hand<00:00:37.980> in<00:00:38.250> this<00:00:38.430> way<00:00:38.640> with<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.210> lower<00:00:39.390> hand

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
hand in this way with the lower hand

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.710 
hand in this way with the lower hand
okay<00:00:40.470> then<00:00:40.620> have<00:00:40.770> them<00:00:40.950> grip<00:00:41.190> again<00:00:41.600> and<00:00:42.600> if

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:42.720 
okay then have them grip again and if

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.350 
okay then have them grip again and if
that<00:00:43.280> that<00:00:44.280> reduces<00:00:44.790> their<00:00:44.910> pain<00:00:44.970> they<00:00:45.330> have

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
that that reduces their pain they have

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.030 
that that reduces their pain they have
with<00:00:45.720> whatever<00:00:45.900> painful<00:00:46.410> motion<00:00:46.680> it<00:00:46.770> was<00:00:46.890> that

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:47.040 
with whatever painful motion it was that

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.380 
with whatever painful motion it was that
you're<00:00:47.130> going<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.310> tape<00:00:47.550> in<00:00:47.820> that<00:00:48.180> direction

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
you're going to tape in that direction

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.290 
you're going to tape in that direction
if<00:00:49.110> that<00:00:49.440> is<00:00:49.680> not<00:00:49.890> comfortable<00:00:50.820> if<00:00:51.180> that

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
if that is not comfortable if that

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.460 
if that is not comfortable if that
didn't<00:00:51.510> increase<00:00:51.810> their<00:00:51.960> comfort<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.410> you

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:52.470 
didn't increase their comfort that you

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.050 
didn't increase their comfort that you
go<00:00:52.560> in<00:00:52.650> the<00:00:52.710> opposite<00:00:53.040> direction<00:00:53.160> pushing

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:54.060 
go in the opposite direction pushing

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.450 
go in the opposite direction pushing
inward<00:00:54.390> pushing<00:00:55.170> outward<00:00:55.980> with<00:00:56.130> the<00:00:56.220> upper

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
inward pushing outward with the upper

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.660 
inward pushing outward with the upper
hand<00:00:56.490> inward<00:00:57.030> with<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.450> lower<00:00:57.630> hand<00:00:58.070> so<00:00:59.070> have

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
hand inward with the lower hand so have

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.900 
hand inward with the lower hand so have
them<00:00:59.990> reattempt<00:01:00.990> the<00:01:01.320> motion<00:01:02.310> and<00:01:02.640> if<00:01:02.760> that

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
them reattempt the motion and if that

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.340 
them reattempt the motion and if that
helps<00:01:03.210> then<00:01:03.330> you<00:01:03.420> try<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.630> recreate<00:01:03.990> that

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
helps then you try to recreate that

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.620 
helps then you try to recreate that
motion<00:01:04.559> today<00:01:04.890> so<00:01:06.530> taping<00:01:07.530> looks<00:01:07.740> like<00:01:07.979> this

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
motion today so taping looks like this

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:14.830 
motion today so taping looks like this
this<00:01:09.630> is<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.990> base<00:01:10.200> layer<00:01:13.429> have<00:01:14.429> you<00:01:14.520> straight

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
this is the base layer have you straight

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.160 
this is the base layer have you straight
just

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
just

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.760 
just
that<00:01:17.540> you<00:01:18.540> don't<00:01:18.659> need<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.930> apply<00:01:19.080> any<00:01:19.170> tension

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
that you don't need to apply any tension

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.020 
that you don't need to apply any tension
there<00:01:19.920> just<00:01:20.100> lay<00:01:20.250> down<00:01:20.280> try<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:20.820> avoid

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
there just lay down try to avoid

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.609 
there just lay down try to avoid
wrinkles<00:01:23.930> then<00:01:24.930> this<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.229> going<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.439> be<00:01:25.530> the

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
wrinkles then this is going to be the

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.580 
wrinkles then this is going to be the
top<00:01:25.799> layer<00:01:26.070> of<00:01:26.100> tape<00:01:27.110> generally<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.140> use<00:01:28.380> either

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
top layer of tape generally I use either

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.399 
top layer of tape generally I use either
leuco<00:01:29.070> tape<00:01:29.340> or<00:01:29.820> this<00:01:30.270> is<00:01:30.420> an<00:01:30.509> enduro<00:01:30.869> taping

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
leuco tape or this is an enduro taping

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:37.969 
leuco tape or this is an enduro taping
but<00:01:33.530> so<00:01:34.530> long<00:01:34.740> as<00:01:34.920> it's<00:01:35.100> tough<00:01:35.640> enough<00:01:36.380> well<00:01:37.380> he

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
but so long as it's tough enough well he

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.060 
but so long as it's tough enough well he
sipped<00:01:38.190> enough<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.580> stick<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:38.970> base<00:01:39.149> layer

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
sipped enough to stick to the base layer

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.800 
sipped enough to stick to the base layer
it<00:01:41.070> should<00:01:41.280> be<00:01:41.399> fine<00:01:41.610> so<00:01:41.759> I'm<00:01:41.880> taping<00:01:42.060> I'm

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
it should be fine so I'm taping I'm

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.149 
it should be fine so I'm taping I'm
taping<00:01:43.080> in<00:01:43.320> this<00:01:43.439> direction<00:01:43.830> but<00:01:43.950> it's<00:01:44.100> the

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
taping in this direction but it's the

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.320 
taping in this direction but it's the
same<00:01:44.310> principle<00:01:44.520> if<00:01:44.789> you<00:01:44.880> go<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.119> other<00:01:45.149> way

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
same principle if you go the other way

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:46.580 
same principle if you go the other way
so<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.750> idea<00:01:46.020> is<00:01:46.140> basically<00:01:46.470> you're<00:01:46.560> just

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
so the idea is basically you're just

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.190 
so the idea is basically you're just
going<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.860> pull<00:01:47.039> the<00:01:47.189> skin<00:01:47.690> from<00:01:48.690> this<00:01:48.899> point

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
going to pull the skin from this point

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.809 
going to pull the skin from this point
to<00:01:49.679> this<00:01:49.800> point<00:01:49.950> you're<00:01:50.220> trying<00:01:50.399> to<00:01:50.490> create

00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:50.819 
to this point you're trying to create

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:58.270 
to this point you're trying to create
wrinkles<00:01:51.659> in<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.840> tape

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.950 

it's<00:01:58.850> like<00:01:59.060> so

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
it's like so

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.020 
it's like so
and<00:02:01.260> then<00:02:01.620> you'd<00:02:01.740> have<00:02:01.770> them<00:02:02.040> retried<00:02:02.520> there

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
and then you'd have them retried there

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.940 
and then you'd have them retried there
whatever<00:02:03.780> motion<00:02:04.170> was<00:02:04.290> painful<00:02:04.650> to<00:02:04.710> begin

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
whatever motion was painful to begin

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.280 
whatever motion was painful to begin
with<00:02:05.100> might<00:02:05.310> be<00:02:05.460> wrist<00:02:06.270> extension<00:02:06.630> flexion<00:02:06.870> or

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
with might be wrist extension flexion or

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.790 
with might be wrist extension flexion or
elbow<00:02:07.550> motions<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:08.729> then<00:02:08.990> if<00:02:09.990> you've<00:02:10.170> gotten

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
elbow motions and then if you've gotten

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.960 
elbow motions and then if you've gotten
the<00:02:10.890> effect<00:02:11.190> you're<00:02:11.310> looking<00:02:11.550> for<00:02:11.730> it<00:02:11.820> should

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
the effect you're looking for it should

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.970 
the effect you're looking for it should
feel<00:02:12.270> better<00:02:12.960> even<00:02:13.320> if<00:02:13.410> it's<00:02:13.530> only<00:02:13.650> a<00:02:13.830> small

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
feel better even if it's only a small

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.660 
feel better even if it's only a small
degree<00:02:14.430> better<00:02:15.170> so<00:02:16.170> for<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.530> wrist<00:02:16.770> it's<00:02:17.490> the

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
degree better so for the wrist it's the

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.300 
degree better so for the wrist it's the
same<00:02:17.880> concept<00:02:18.480> you<00:02:18.720> have<00:02:19.410> them<00:02:19.620> start<00:02:20.130> off

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
same concept you have them start off

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.220 
same concept you have them start off
with<00:02:20.490> whatever<00:02:20.780> motion<00:02:21.780> is<00:02:21.870> uncomfortable

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
with whatever motion is uncomfortable

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.610 
with whatever motion is uncomfortable
and<00:02:23.840> then<00:02:24.840> you're<00:02:24.959> going<00:02:25.080> to<00:02:25.140> give<00:02:25.350> a<00:02:25.380> little

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
and then you're going to give a little

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.580 
and then you're going to give a little
bit<00:02:25.830> of<00:02:25.980> pressure<00:02:26.220> going<00:02:27.030> inward<00:02:27.450> this<00:02:27.600> way<00:02:27.780> or

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
bit of pressure going inward this way or

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.350 
bit of pressure going inward this way or
outward<00:02:28.920> this<00:02:29.100> way<00:02:29.310> have<00:02:29.700> never<00:02:29.940> retried<00:02:30.240> the

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
outward this way have never retried the

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.090 
outward this way have never retried the
motion<00:02:33.050> good<00:02:34.050> hopefully<00:02:34.590> you'll<00:02:34.890> see<00:02:35.070> a

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
motion good hopefully you'll see a

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.520 
motion good hopefully you'll see a
change<00:02:35.940> if<00:02:36.540> not<00:02:36.780> you<00:02:36.930> try<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:37.170> opposite

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
change if not you try the opposite

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.229 
change if not you try the opposite
direction<00:02:37.680> that<00:02:38.930> we're<00:02:39.930> gripping<00:02:41.030> okay<00:02:42.030> and

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
direction that we're gripping okay and

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.620 
direction that we're gripping okay and
then<00:02:42.810> you<00:02:42.900> take<00:02:43.200> in<00:02:44.090> that<00:02:45.090> direction<00:02:45.270> we<00:02:45.540> have

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
then you take in that direction we have

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:59.500 
then you take in that direction we have
you<00:02:45.720> turn<00:02:45.930> your<00:02:46.080> hand<00:02:46.170> over<00:02:46.440> there<00:02:46.650> please

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.130 

okay<00:03:00.080> so<00:03:00.680> generally<00:03:01.099> when<00:03:01.220> a<00:03:01.510> cross<00:03:02.510> midline

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
okay so generally when a cross midline

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.470 
okay so generally when a cross midline
it's<00:03:03.500> gonna<00:03:03.590> be<00:03:03.769> a<00:03:03.799> diagonal<00:03:04.189> one<00:03:04.489> so<00:03:04.730> I'm

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
it's gonna be a diagonal one so I'm

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.080 
it's gonna be a diagonal one so I'm
gonna<00:03:05.799> I'm<00:03:06.799> gonna<00:03:06.920> go<00:03:07.129> in<00:03:07.250> this<00:03:07.400> direction<00:03:07.610> but

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
gonna I'm gonna go in this direction but

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.210 
gonna I'm gonna go in this direction but
again<00:03:08.840> if<00:03:08.959> it's<00:03:09.110> the<00:03:09.260> other<00:03:09.290> if<00:03:09.920> it's<00:03:10.069> the

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
again if it's the other if it's the

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.429 
again if it's the other if it's the
other<00:03:10.370> way<00:03:10.579> like<00:03:10.849> that<00:03:11.420> eight<00:03:12.019> would<00:03:12.140> go<00:03:12.260> from

00:03:12.429 --> 00:03:12.439 
other way like that eight would go from

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:15.899 
other way like that eight would go from
here<00:03:12.620> to<00:03:12.739> here<00:03:12.920> so<00:03:13.450> you<00:03:14.450> set<00:03:14.629> your<00:03:14.659> base<00:03:14.870> layer

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:15.909 
here to here so you set your base layer

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:20.399 
here to here so you set your base layer
you<00:03:16.909> want<00:03:17.030> a<00:03:17.120> small<00:03:17.390> strip<00:03:17.659> at<00:03:17.810> the<00:03:17.840> top<00:03:18.459> tape

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:20.409 
you want a small strip at the top tape

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:24.910 
you want a small strip at the top tape
start<00:03:21.409> at<00:03:21.470> one<00:03:21.620> end<00:03:23.409> pull<00:03:24.409> towards<00:03:24.709> the<00:03:24.769> other

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
start at one end pull towards the other

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.059 
start at one end pull towards the other
trying<00:03:25.220> to<00:03:25.310> create<00:03:25.489> wrinkles<00:03:25.879> in<00:03:26.000> the<00:03:26.090> skin

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:27.069 
trying to create wrinkles in the skin

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:29.440 
trying to create wrinkles in the skin
just<00:03:28.069> like<00:03:28.250> that<00:03:28.459> and<00:03:28.640> have<00:03:28.790> them<00:03:28.939> recreate

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
just like that and have them recreate

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.440 
just like that and have them recreate
their<00:03:29.720> motion<00:03:30.709> and<00:03:30.829> hopefully<00:03:31.450> hopefully

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
their motion and hopefully hopefully

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.199 
their motion and hopefully hopefully
you've<00:03:32.690> seen<00:03:32.870> some<00:03:33.049> improvement<00:03:33.530> so<00:03:34.120> kind<00:03:35.120> of

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
you've seen some improvement so kind of

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.050 
you've seen some improvement so kind of
did<00:03:35.299> it<00:03:35.420> quickly<00:03:35.569> here<00:03:35.900> but<00:03:36.609> the<00:03:37.609> big<00:03:37.760> issue<00:03:37.940> is

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
did it quickly here but the big issue is

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.089 
did it quickly here but the big issue is
with<00:03:38.239> the<00:03:38.329> tape<00:03:38.510> sticking<00:03:38.989> really<00:03:39.859> try<00:03:40.040> to

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:40.099 
with the tape sticking really try to

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:41.500 
with the tape sticking really try to
make<00:03:40.310> sure<00:03:40.340> that<00:03:40.579> you<00:03:40.730> get<00:03:40.819> the<00:03:40.940> table<00:03:41.299> all<00:03:41.420> the

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
make sure that you get the table all the

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.430 
make sure that you get the table all the
way<00:03:41.599> down<00:03:41.840> I<00:03:42.109> tell<00:03:42.440> people<00:03:42.639> to<00:03:43.959> check<00:03:44.959> for<00:03:45.200> skin

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
way down I tell people to check for skin

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.809 
way down I tell people to check for skin
irritation<00:03:45.980> it's<00:03:46.099> fine<00:03:46.340> to<00:03:46.519> wear<00:03:46.579> it<00:03:46.700> in<00:03:46.790> the

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:46.819 
irritation it's fine to wear it in the

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:48.729 
irritation it's fine to wear it in the
shower<00:03:46.909> that's<00:03:47.810> the<00:03:48.019> best<00:03:48.200> place<00:03:48.409> to<00:03:48.440> try<00:03:48.680> to

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
shower that's the best place to try to

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:49.990 
shower that's the best place to try to
take<00:03:48.980> it<00:03:49.129> off<00:03:49.250> when<00:03:49.430> you're<00:03:49.519> ready<00:03:49.700> to<00:03:49.849> have

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
take it off when you're ready to have

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.770 
take it off when you're ready to have
when<00:03:50.569> you're<00:03:50.659> ready<00:03:50.810> to<00:03:50.930> take<00:03:51.109> it<00:03:51.260> off<00:03:51.400> and

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
when you're ready to take it off and

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.629 
when you're ready to take it off and
when<00:03:53.780> you<00:03:53.810> do<00:03:54.019> take<00:03:54.200> it<00:03:54.349> off<00:03:54.470> do<00:03:55.010> so<00:03:55.220> slowly

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:55.639 
when you do take it off do so slowly

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:57.550 
when you do take it off do so slowly
because<00:03:56.150> the<00:03:56.180> stuff<00:03:56.480> gets<00:03:56.690> tacked<00:03:57.470> down

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
because the stuff gets tacked down

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.860 
because the stuff gets tacked down
pretty<00:03:57.889> good<00:03:58.040> over<00:03:58.250> time<00:03:58.459> so<00:03:59.420> those<00:03:59.599> are<00:03:59.750> some

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
pretty good over time so those are some

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.340 
pretty good over time so those are some
taping<00:04:00.349> ideas<00:04:00.620> for<00:04:00.769> the<00:04:00.859> elbow<00:04:00.980> in<00:04:01.129> the<00:04:01.190> wrist
