and<00:02:20.570> it<00:02:20.750> seems<00:02:20.959> to<00:02:21.050> serve<00:02:21.260> only<00:02:21.590> as<00:02:21.709> a<00:02:21.739> way<00:02:21.890> to

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
and it seems to serve only as a way to

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.560 
and it seems to serve only as a way to
familiarize<00:02:22.430> yourself<00:02:22.550> with<00:02:22.970> the<00:02:23.150> controls

this<00:02:24.500> is<00:02:24.650> actually<00:02:24.950> quite<00:02:25.160> helpful<00:02:25.370> though

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
this is actually quite helpful though

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.150 
this is actually quite helpful though
because<00:02:26.060> the<00:02:26.510> way<00:02:26.630> Mario<00:02:26.900> controls<00:02:27.470> is<00:02:27.739> just

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160

the<00:03:14.000> question<00:03:14.420> is<00:03:14.660> is<00:03:14.900> the<00:03:15.590> game<00:03:15.769> fun<00:03:16.130> well<00:03:17.090> yes

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
the question is is the game fun well yes

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.140 
the question is is the game fun well yes
and<00:03:17.780> no<00:03:17.840> as<00:03:18.560> I<00:03:19.370> mentioned<00:03:19.700> earlier<00:03:20.000> the

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
and no as I mentioned earlier the

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.789 
and no as I mentioned earlier the
controls<00:03:20.510> are<00:03:20.660> all<00:03:20.810> messed<00:03:21.170> up<00:03:21.410> and<00:03:21.620> this

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
controls are all messed up and this

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:23.410

really<00:03:21.980> puts<00:03:22.220> a<00:03:22.280> hamper<00:03:22.610> on<00:03:22.730> the<00:03:22.910> experience

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
really puts a hamper on the experience

and<00:03:48.230> considering<00:03:48.830> that<00:03:48.950> one<00:03:49.129> of<00:03:49.250> them<00:03:49.400> is

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:49.520 
and considering that one of them is

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.520 
and considering that one of them is
actually<00:03:49.819> the<00:03:49.970> final<00:03:50.300> boss<00:03:50.480> of<00:03:50.629> the<00:03:50.690> game

actually the final boss of the game

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.490 
actually the final boss of the game
it's<00:03:51.830> all<00:03:52.040> really<00:03:52.340> anticlimactic<00:03:53.500> actually

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
it's all really anticlimactic actually

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.650 
it's all really anticlimactic actually
speaking<00:03:54.740> of<00:03:54.890> anticlimactic<00:03:55.370> take<00:03:56.360> a<00:03:56.390> look<00:03:56.569> at

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
speaking of anticlimactic take a look at

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:09.370 
speaking of anticlimactic take a look at
this<00:03:56.780> ending<00:04:07.540> though<00:04:08.540> I<00:04:08.569> guess<00:04:09.020> I<00:04:09.140> shouldn't

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
this ending though I guess I shouldn't

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:10.840 
this ending though I guess I shouldn't
have<00:04:09.440> expected<00:04:09.590> too<00:04:10.040> much<00:04:10.069> from<00:04:10.430> a<00:04:10.489> pirated
