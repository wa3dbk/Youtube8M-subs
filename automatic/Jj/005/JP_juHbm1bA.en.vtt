00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:12.940 
system now it wants to back it up to a

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.840 
system now it wants to back it up to a
location<00:01:13.390> and<00:01:13.840> it's<00:01:14.410> found<00:01:14.680> an<00:01:15.640> actual

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
location and it's found an actual

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.590 
location and it's found an actual
partition<00:01:16.690> on<00:01:16.899> this<00:01:17.380> drive<00:01:17.680> now<00:01:18.520> really<00:01:19.240> and

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
partition on this drive now really and

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.540 
partition on this drive now really and
truly<00:01:19.840> this<00:01:20.110> is<00:01:20.259> not<00:01:20.470> ideal<00:01:20.649> as<00:01:21.070> it<00:01:21.130> says<00:01:21.520> here

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.550 
truly this is not ideal as it says here

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.910 
truly this is not ideal as it says here
because<00:01:22.479> if<00:01:22.600> the<00:01:22.750> drive<00:01:22.960> failed<00:01:23.350> you<00:01:23.830> would

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
because if the drive failed you would

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.590 
because if the drive failed you would
obviously<00:01:24.280> lose<00:01:24.490> your<00:01:24.670> backup<00:01:25.030> image<00:01:25.330> but

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
obviously lose your backup image but

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.120 
obviously lose your backup image but
just<00:01:25.780> for<00:01:25.900> this<00:01:25.990> video<00:01:26.320> I'm<00:01:26.799> going<00:01:26.979> to<00:01:27.040> be

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
just for this video I'm going to be

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.190 
just for this video I'm going to be
using<00:01:27.490> this<00:01:27.640> partition<00:01:28.330> here<00:01:28.600> okay<00:01:28.900> but<00:01:29.110> you

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
using this partition here okay but you

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.620 
using this partition here okay but you
should<00:01:29.229> really<00:01:29.650> backup<00:01:30.130> to<00:01:30.729> an<00:01:30.820> external<00:01:31.180> hard

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
should really backup to an external hard

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.260 
should really backup to an external hard
