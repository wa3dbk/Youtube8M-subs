00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:14.329
 save file from avi because this is the trick that 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:20.439
 I'm preparing them prepared to find English cream earth for new year 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:22.720
 then 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.109
 elf I wanted to show me the application in this video 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:28.769
 provides for the application 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.649
 d a product 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:32.470
 this is 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.030
 lost in flash 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.510
 didy now 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.510
 milan skinflash texts with the same function 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.720
 the same model is above the stain 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.870
 killer bee 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.250
 the lists then I have the touch eclat 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.120
 only 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.810
 I have always thought of mixing similar products 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:56.280
 however, from abroad, the clinic is a similar product however 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.630
 these 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.090
 concealers 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.250
 just illuminating 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.940
 which 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.790
 we talk about it a lot if we talk about it a lot but in the end 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.640
 it is not clear what the function is 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.990
 sunblock i did 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.790
 a few days ago I published an article 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.799
 where i talk 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.920
 of these two products 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:28.130
 compare them 3 as you can see my final choice fell on the bosc in 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.130
 flash art 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.259
 we want to talk about it also because they are not products that 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.220
 year a cost 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.430
 obviously as I always say unfortunately with this brand 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.960
 and I now channel 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.920
 list then you don't pay 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:42.990
 very much too 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.810
 I really like the name of the product as I have to say 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.020
 it's convenient um 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.790
 not a great deal of coverage 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:58.560
 in fact, during use above the foundation the foundation. of italy genoa use 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.040
 I don't use it on 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.310
 can also be used without 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.140
 the foundation 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.730
 but a product 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.730
 really a cover 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:15.560
 so you have to evaluate these things I don't want to talk about the product so much 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.539
 headquarter 

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:22.559
 for me that I talked about on the blog I created. also villas the comparison between the 

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:25.199
 two of them I will be a great illusion 

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:27.970
 in this video I wanted to own ferridea 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.939
 the application because 

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:32.869
 16 to meet 

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:37.899
 a product that costs 38 40 euros 

00:02:38.679 --> 00:02:43.700
 I believe it is necessary before deciding to buy it I think it is 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.450
 important at least 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.209
 list ban a little more see the app see how it fades if 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:51.769
 his easily 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:53.169
 and all the rest 

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:55.989
 so if I hope it's useful 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:59.860
 a because if we talk about it a lot if we talk about it a lot 

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:05.290
 I think I'm talking about a can so I exaggerate a little bit 

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:10.029
 however in short it is a comfortable product a nice place to be easily 

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:14.669
 and want it. revive how he is like an optician 

00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:16.959
 so let's see what he did 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.109
 shady flashes like me and touche eclat applied slabs cost 

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:25.059
 discomfort over the foundation that without foundation 

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:30.219
 I definitely prefer the application above 

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:31.679
 the foundation 

00:03:31.679 --> 00:03:34.869
 just because I didn't apply concealer 

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:38.650
 auditors with the corrector before the foundation in this case 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:39.489
 1 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:42.719
 the foundation I used m 

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:47.259
 matched to this point 

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:50.469
 I prefer a foundation to this product 

00:03:50.469 --> 00:03:51.780
 that we never have 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.340
 I respect you for this is mine was never seen 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:58.730
 the skinfill mineral 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:59.989
 comes out 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:06.229
 the condemnation of opposition 15 and this in particular beyond the nw 20 

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:10.139
 today I went to the market an app for mac 

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:11.889
 a cover 

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:13.699
 from read average 

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:18.760
 it is a dream that I like especially in winter have advice or girls 

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:20.169
 who have a skin 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:23.169
 from the normal assiteca 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:27.180
 tell me a foundation that leaves your face 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:30.729
 slightly of him then slightly 

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:35.759
 but with a slight brightness it is not an opaque foundation 

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:39.990
 I like it a lot. for if for when 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.400
 I want a little more natural makeup 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.400
 it is a cover that is not very high 

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:50.819
 so now I'm going to click 

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:53.819
