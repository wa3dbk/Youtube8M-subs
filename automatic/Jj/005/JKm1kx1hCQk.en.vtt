00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:03.580
 Hello and welcome to wrinkles with Yvonne. 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.840
 Today I'll show you how to fold a baby shoe out of a bank note. 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.840
 Here we go! 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.620
 Fold one corner up so that it is flush with the top edge. 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.820
 It creates a triangle. 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.220
 This creates this edge. 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.380
 Fold the triangle over it. 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.400
 Open these folds again. 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.700
 Place the right part at the fold edge to the left. 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.800
 Now your glow is square. 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.520
 Halve your square lengthwise. 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.860
 Open it again and cut it in half. 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.220
 Open this fold again. 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.640
 Fold this edge towards the center line. 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.800
 Open this fold again. 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.140
 Now fold on this fold edge the edge of your glow. 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.620
 Open this fold again. 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 Turn your bill and halve it. 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.800
 Put it in front of you, showing the open side to the right. 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.240
 The small folding edge is on top. 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.880
 Orient yourself at the small fold 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.820
 and fold your bill up that way. 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.480
 Now fold this corner to a small triangle. 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.480
 Turn your banknote over 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.960
 and repeat the step on the other side. 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.300
 Open your banknote so you can see the square again. 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.640
 You now have these fold edges. 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.060
 to be able to fold your bill in the middle well together. 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.060
 you fold the folding edge. 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.460
 Take the tip with your right hand 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.560
 and fold the bill with your left hand. 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.820
 Your bill looks like this. 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.700
 Fold this tip to this top. 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 This is what it looks like. 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.000
 Open the last two folds again. 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.040
 Again, you see two fold edges 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.400
 fold it down. 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.560
 Flip the lower part of the bill to the back 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.780
 and then fold your bill in the middle. 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.420
 Here is the thin strip from the beginning. 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.200
 Fold it up. 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.940
 Now fold your banknote. 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.900
 The corner of the thin strip points to the right. 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.620
 Fold the right corner along the thin strip to the left. 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.040
 At this corner, you fold the left top to the right. 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 Your bill looks like this. 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.100
 Fold the right and left corner a little bit inwards. 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.500
 One more step. 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.040
 Turn your banknote over 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.140
 Orient yourself again on the thin strip. 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.100
 You pull this apart. 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.240
 Put your finger in and put the shoe on. 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.880
