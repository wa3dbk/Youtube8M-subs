00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.040
 every year is one of the biggest attractions of 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.860
 campus party are the computers 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.480
 modified that are called 15 deaths 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.100
 we are here with emerson will explain a 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.619
 bit to people who are exactly 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.820
 these pcs is one more that exactly 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:24.560
 the 15 deaths 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.320
 with the global crisis, I think 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.939
 most basic definition could speak it 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.070
 the modification you make to a cabinet 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:33.140
 computer that is square 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.020
 modifies the way you want it from 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.600
 paint it let paint up a structure 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:41.180
 new to him in the case of the keys the people 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.250
 has a new structure and what has 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.800
 behind this machine that has to 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.960
 hardware behind his entire machine. 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.460
 structure is a motherboard of 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.220
 high performance right? 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.980
 a core i3 fourth-generation memory 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:57.890
 It is two ram and fish memories of eight 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.620
 2.400 megahertz gigs with ssd of 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.320
 Hitachi 128gb also how long 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.119
 it took time to build charizard it 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.100
 was being planned since February 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:09.170
 last year they get out of bed 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.440
 but I started to run it himself was in 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.820
 September still 16 months ago do not see the 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.380
 job 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.910
 another interesting mod case 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.630
 attracted the attention of the campuses here in 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:22.580
 campus party and 2015 was a js a case mod 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.020
 inspired by today's robot 5 that you 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.370
 You must meet him from theaters. 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.250
 the Jack will tell you a little bit for us 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:31.550
 what he did here that you see in this 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:34.190
 case mod is this mod case was inspired 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:37.790
 in the movie bordoni 5 a robot in porto 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:40.640
 and the main idea of â€‹â€‹it is a 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.950
 educational purpose for this effect 90% of 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.409
 recycled material can lead you to 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.380
 some schools which encourage 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:50.290
 kids joking to build a robot and 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.180
 have knowledge of electronic base 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:56.000
 mechanical robotic programming and 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.380
 manual work between 500 and 600 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.270
 the remainder is all material 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.740
 recycled even what materials were 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.649
 used for js construction 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:11.039
 then it has scrap of work as 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:15.180
 pvc has printer modem pieces of 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:17.580
 a cpu has electronic charge that 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.709
 also had to donate up to one 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.239
 of a pot of mayonnaise is 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.340
 here serving as rosana 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.620
 it works with a control of 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.760
 Inep video game basically the control of 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.459
 playstation 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.140
 Yes, without the control that is using a 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.330
 playstation control 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:37.140
 but it can also be controlled 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:39.930
 cellphone via bluetooth there tablet control 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.489
 also by infrared but what 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.930
 we found less interference than 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.330
 inside the campus party that was the 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.940
 playstation control maciel barreto 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.860
 started building 15 bikes in 2008 and 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.750
 won the first Brazilian championship 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.720
 held on campus party in the same year 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.760
 in 2009 and took the bicampeonato in the 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.220
 category and also took the 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.200
 title of world champion this year 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.360
 barreto again won the category 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.060
 scratch of the championship held in 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.859
 campus party with its new mod case with 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.200
 This is a computer that I created. 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:12.540
 from scratch is not that's why 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.030
 set in scratch mode 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.310
 it took me six months to do it he is 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.049
 all made of fiberglass used 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.420
 there are also other forms of fact 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:23.790
 to make silicone 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:29.330
 the synthetic jargon can model the pieces 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:32.990
 and used is a ssd iraque are more 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:35.930
 a motherboard base rate on the processor 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:38.870
 intel and this look is also the smell 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:42.260
 more comic but drawn by caricature and 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:46.760
 showing a dog riding a robot 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:48.950
 dog is called the group and dog is is the 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.080
 sensational chubb this theme calls 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.700
 enough attention of the morning and made a 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.580
 something also innovative this time around that the 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.500
 mechanical interaction with the computer 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.140
 so you have to move part 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.850
 you need it is used for power 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.280
 human but then you enjoy also makes 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.790
 an exercise to prevent these 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.790
 stuff like that
