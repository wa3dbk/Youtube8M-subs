let's learn it so how to catch the cards
the<00:00:41.300> finger<00:00:41.600> positioning<00:00:42.230> is<00:00:42.379> really

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:42.650 
the finger positioning is really

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.920 
the finger positioning is really
important<00:00:43.180> you<00:00:44.180> want<00:00:44.330> to<00:00:44.390> make<00:00:44.540> sure<00:00:44.570> to<00:00:44.809> the

thumb is on the other side now watch how

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.500 
thumb is on the other side now watch how
did<00:00:55.040> pinky<00:00:55.339> finger<00:00:55.610> is<00:00:55.760> right<00:00:55.940> below<00:00:56.120> and

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
did pinky finger is right below and

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:57.759 
did pinky finger is right below and
actually<00:00:56.900> supporting<00:00:57.350> the<00:00:57.440> car<00:00:57.620> from

00:00:57.759 --> 00:00:57.769 
actually supporting the car from

00:00:57.769 --> 00:00:59.380 
actually supporting the car from
following<00:00:58.010> down<00:00:58.220> this<00:00:58.940> part<00:00:59.239> is<00:00:59.330> really

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
following down this part is really

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.479 
following down this part is really
important<00:01:00.019> because<00:01:00.199> when<00:01:01.100> you<00:01:01.220> start

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
important because when you start

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.750 
important because when you start
stringing<00:01:01.790> the<00:01:01.970> cards<00:01:03.339> while<00:01:04.339> a<00:01:04.370> child<00:01:04.610> the

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
stringing the cards while a child the

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.250 
stringing the cards while a child the
pinky<00:01:05.059> finger<00:01:05.300> supports<00:01:05.780> the<00:01:05.870> cards<00:01:06.110> from

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
pinky finger supports the cards from

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.010 
pinky finger supports the cards from
falling<00:01:06.620> we're<00:01:07.430> in<00:01:07.610> this<00:01:07.850> case<00:01:08.090> if<00:01:08.360> the<00:01:08.420> pinky

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
falling we're in this case if the pinky

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.219 
falling we're in this case if the pinky
finger<00:01:09.290> was<00:01:09.440> not<00:01:09.740> at<00:01:09.920> the<00:01:10.010> bottom<00:01:10.930> the<00:01:11.930> cards

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
finger was not at the bottom the cards

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.840 
finger was not at the bottom the cards
will<00:01:12.409> fall<00:01:12.710> like<00:01:12.740> this<00:01:13.870> ok<00:01:14.870> so<00:01:15.530> do<00:01:16.490> note<00:01:16.820> that

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
will fall like this ok so do note that

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.880 
will fall like this ok so do note that
carefully<00:01:17.420> that<00:01:17.840> the<00:01:17.870> pinky<00:01:18.290> finger<00:01:18.530> needs<00:01:18.710> to

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
carefully that the pinky finger needs to

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.920 
carefully that the pinky finger needs to
be<00:01:18.979> on<00:01:19.070> the<00:01:19.159> bottom<00:01:19.250> to<00:01:19.460> catch<00:01:19.670> with<00:01:20.570> great

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
be on the bottom to catch with great

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.250 
be on the bottom to catch with great
accuracy<00:01:22.570> so<00:01:23.570> you're<00:01:23.750> basically<00:01:23.900> in

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.260 
accuracy so you're basically in

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.560 
accuracy so you're basically in
something<00:01:24.680> like<00:01:24.740> a<00:01:24.830> death<00:01:24.980> grip<00:01:25.330> that's<00:01:26.330> the

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
something like a death grip that's the

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.260 
something like a death grip that's the
hand<00:01:26.750> positioning<00:01:27.230> for<00:01:27.440> the<00:01:28.160> catching<00:01:28.760> hand

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.320 

so<00:01:32.270> now<00:01:32.510> how<00:01:32.750> to<00:01:32.780> spring<00:01:33.170> the<00:01:33.260> cards<00:01:34.330> let's

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
so now how to spring the cards let's

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.590 
so now how to spring the cards let's
first<00:01:36.230> talk<00:01:36.350> about<00:01:36.410> how<00:01:36.710> to<00:01:36.770> position<00:01:37.040> hand

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
first talk about how to position hand

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.510 
first talk about how to position hand
your<00:01:38.600> thumb<00:01:38.840> is<00:01:39.590> going<00:01:39.890> to<00:01:39.980> go<00:01:40.100> on<00:01:40.220> the<00:01:40.370> very

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520

corner of the cards so if you're
right-handed<00:01:43.270> your<00:01:44.270> thumb<00:01:44.450> is<00:01:44.600> going<00:01:44.780> to<00:01:44.870> go

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
right-handed your thumb is going to go

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.330 
right-handed your thumb is going to go
on<00:01:44.990> the<00:01:45.170> very<00:01:45.350> left<00:01:45.560> hand<00:01:45.890> corner<00:01:46.840> right<00:01:47.840> here

like this in one position isn't very

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.330 
like this in one position isn't very
comfortable<00:02:23.170> try<00:02:24.170> and<00:02:24.260> change<00:02:24.409> it<00:02:24.500> up<00:02:24.650> there

comfortable try and change it up there

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.460 
comfortable try and change it up there
is<00:02:25.520> really<00:02:25.850> no<00:02:25.970> right<00:02:26.150> and<00:02:26.330> wrong<00:02:26.360> it's<00:02:27.319> just

together and start springing one by one
you<00:03:40.470> might<00:03:41.010> not<00:03:41.190> happen<00:03:41.370> for<00:03:41.730> you<00:03:41.850> right<00:03:42.269> away

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
you might not happen for you right away

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.020 
you might not happen for you right away
but<00:03:43.019> just<00:03:43.230> keep<00:03:43.380> trying<00:03:43.709> this<00:03:44.519> is<00:03:44.700> this

technique is all about practice at first
cards<00:03:48.269> are<00:03:48.330> going<00:03:48.480> to<00:03:48.570> go<00:03:48.660> everywhere<00:03:49.110> but

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
cards are going to go everywhere but

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.530 
cards are going to go everywhere but
that's<00:03:49.860> okay<00:03:50.160> everybody<00:03:50.940> starts<00:03:51.239> out<00:03:51.330> like

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
that's okay everybody starts out like

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.160 
that's okay everybody starts out like
this<00:03:51.690> as<00:03:53.269> for<00:03:54.269> where<00:03:54.450> you<00:03:54.630> should<00:03:54.840> position

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
this as for where you should position

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.390 
this as for where you should position
the<00:03:55.410> catching<00:03:55.769> hand<00:03:56.209> this<00:03:57.209> this<00:03:58.140> particular

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
the catching hand this this particular

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.220 
the catching hand this this particular
spring<00:03:59.400> is<00:03:59.549> devised<00:03:59.940> so<00:04:00.480> that<00:04:00.720> when<00:04:01.170> you

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
spring is devised so that when you

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:02.930 
spring is devised so that when you
spring<00:04:01.470> the<00:04:01.560> cards<00:04:01.860> it<00:04:02.190> goes<00:04:02.459> straight<00:04:02.640> to

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
spring the cards it goes straight to

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.789 
spring the cards it goes straight to
wherever<00:04:03.120> you're<00:04:03.360> pointing<00:04:03.720> at<00:04:03.840> two<00:04:03.989> so<00:04:04.709> if

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
wherever you're pointing at two so if

I'm springing it from the top you just

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.990 
I'm springing it from the top you just
need<00:04:07.260> to<00:04:07.320> point<00:04:07.500> place<00:04:07.980> you're<00:04:08.250> catching<00:04:08.880> and
