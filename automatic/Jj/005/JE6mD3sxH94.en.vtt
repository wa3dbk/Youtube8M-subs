and<00:02:33.760> I<00:02:33.850> never<00:02:34.060> knew<00:02:34.420> you<00:02:34.600> can<00:02:34.810> use<00:02:34.959> eyeshadow

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
and I never knew you can use eyeshadow

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.010 
and I never knew you can use eyeshadow
as<00:02:35.770> an<00:02:36.069> eyeliner<00:02:36.459> but<00:02:36.910> I<00:02:37.239> thought<00:02:37.690> that's<00:02:37.840> the

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
as an eyeliner but I thought that's the

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.380 
as an eyeliner but I thought that's the
first<00:02:38.380> thing<00:02:38.739> yeah<00:02:39.310> I<00:02:39.640> used<00:02:40.060> to<00:02:40.150> think<00:02:40.300> like

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
first thing yeah I used to think like

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.559 
first thing yeah I used to think like
only<00:02:40.660> liquid<00:02:41.170> or<00:02:41.319> the<00:02:41.350> pencil<00:02:41.650> now<00:02:42.459> I<00:02:42.850> think

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
only liquid or the pencil now I think

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:46.440 
only liquid or the pencil now I think
powders<00:02:44.500> actually<00:02:45.310> last<00:02:45.970> longer<00:02:46.269> because

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
powders actually last longer because

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.470 
powders actually last longer because
blacks<00:02:46.900> on<00:02:47.200> your<00:02:47.890> body<00:02:48.069> is<00:02:48.190> warm<00:02:48.400> and<00:02:48.730> it<00:02:48.880> warms

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
blacks on your body is warm and it warms

blacks on your body is warm and it warms

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
up and melts and starts getting all

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:59.250 
up and melts and starts getting all
nasty<00:02:52.720> and<00:02:52.989> gooey<00:02:53.350> and<00:02:53.970> this<00:02:54.970> doesn't<00:02:58.170> and<00:02:59.170> I

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260
