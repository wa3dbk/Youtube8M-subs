00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.179 
I hated the way they looked when you
first<00:01:18.570> get<00:01:18.689> them<00:01:18.869> on<00:01:19.080> like<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.799> minute<00:01:20.070> you

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
first get them on like the minute you

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.399 
first get them on like the minute you
get<00:01:20.310> them<00:01:20.520> on<00:01:20.700> it<00:01:21.119> doesn't<00:01:21.630> hurt<00:01:21.930> but<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.229> feel

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
get them on it doesn't hurt but you feel

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.080 
get them on it doesn't hurt but you feel
pressure<00:01:22.799> like<00:01:23.130> it<00:01:23.250> just<00:01:23.430> feels<00:01:23.610> like<00:01:23.850> there's

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
pressure like it just feels like there's

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.120 
pressure like it just feels like there's
something<00:01:24.330> like<00:01:24.630> it's<00:01:25.200> kind<00:01:25.560> of<00:01:25.619> like<00:01:25.799> on<00:01:25.979> your

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
something like it's kind of like on your

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.280 
something like it's kind of like on your
mouth<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.970> it's<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.330> weird<00:01:27.509> feeling<00:01:27.750> but<00:01:28.080> it's

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
mouth and it's a weird feeling but it's

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.230 
mouth and it's a weird feeling but it's
on<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.500> bad<00:01:28.680> until<00:01:29.159> about<00:01:29.400> 9:00<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:29.909> then<00:01:30.030> its

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
on the bad until about 9:00 and then its

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.359 
on the bad until about 9:00 and then its
first<00:01:30.780> few<00:01:31.020> days<00:01:31.229> that<00:01:31.259> I<00:01:31.650> had<00:01:31.920> them<00:01:32.100> were<00:01:32.250> the

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
first few days that I had them were the

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.190 
first few days that I had them were the
worst<00:01:32.549> because<00:01:32.820> they<00:01:33.240> hurt<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.750> I<00:01:33.900> didn't

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
worst because they hurt and I didn't

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.200 
worst because they hurt and I didn't
think<00:01:34.350> they<00:01:34.439> looked<00:01:34.680> good<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.220> I<00:01:35.670> still<00:01:36.090> don't

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
think they looked good and I still don't

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.550 
think they looked good and I still don't
really<00:01:36.299> think<00:01:36.540> they<00:01:36.750> like<00:01:36.960> look<00:01:37.170> good<00:01:37.380> or

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
really think they like look good or

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.620 
really think they like look good or
anything<00:01:37.740> but<00:01:38.130> I'm<00:01:38.670> so<00:01:38.909> used<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.180> them<00:01:39.360> I<00:01:39.570> don't

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.240 
anything but I'm so used to them I don't
even<00:01:39.750> notice<00:01:39.990> them<00:01:40.229> so<00:01:40.530> it's<00:01:40.740> fine<00:01:40.950> right<00:01:41.189> now

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
of all time and I've been using this for

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.590 
of all time and I've been using this for
so<00:02:19.770> long<00:02:19.800> like<00:02:20.280> before<00:02:20.610> I<00:02:20.640> got<00:02:20.760> my<00:02:20.850> braces<00:02:20.880> on<00:02:21.300> I

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
so long like before I got my braces on I

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.260 
so long like before I got my braces on I
was<00:02:22.170> using<00:02:22.320> this<00:02:22.530> you<00:02:22.710> got<00:02:22.860> a<00:02:22.920> little<00:02:23.160> gum<00:02:23.430> I

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.090 
was using this you got a little gum I
think<00:02:24.750> they<00:02:24.810> call<00:02:24.960> them<00:02:25.020> Christmas<00:02:25.620> trees<00:02:25.890> but

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
think they call them Christmas trees but

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.770 
think they call them Christmas trees but
they're<00:02:26.250> basically<00:02:26.520> like<00:02:26.790> I'll<00:02:27.390> be<00:02:27.480> I'll<00:02:27.630> do

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
they're basically like I'll be I'll do

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:28.940 
they're basically like I'll be I'll do
to<00:02:27.870> close<00:02:28.020> up<00:02:28.200> on<00:02:28.350> this<00:02:28.470> but<00:02:28.680> they're

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
to close up on this but they're

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.740 
to close up on this but they're
basically<00:02:29.250> just<00:02:29.520> these<00:02:29.610> little<00:02:29.760> green<00:02:30.150> picks

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
basically just these little green picks

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.110 
basically just these little green picks
and<00:02:31.050> they<00:02:31.800> fit<00:02:32.040> right<00:02:32.280> into<00:02:32.460> your<00:02:32.610> braces<00:02:32.790> and

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.790 
and they fit right into your braces and

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
that's how I've lost I never knew the

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.320 
that's how I've lost I never knew the
importance<00:02:35.220> of<00:02:35.400> flossing<00:02:35.580> until<00:02:36.030> I<00:02:36.090> got<00:02:36.210> my

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
importance of flossing until I got my

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.360 
importance of flossing until I got my
braces<00:02:36.540> on<00:02:36.900> because<00:02:37.590> if<00:02:37.830> you<00:02:37.890> don't<00:02:37.980> floss

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
braces on because if you don't floss

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.790 
braces on because if you don't floss
your<00:02:38.700> gums<00:02:39.209> will<00:02:39.540> get<00:02:39.660> like<00:02:39.780> inflames<00:02:40.350> really

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800
