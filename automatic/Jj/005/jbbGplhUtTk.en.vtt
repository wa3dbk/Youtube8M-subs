for some of the companies we've used

for some of the companies we've used
before<00:00:56.500> really<00:00:57.500> it<00:00:57.649> didn't<00:00:57.949> have<00:00:58.219> all<00:00:58.609> the

before really it didn't have all the

before really it didn't have all the
features<00:00:59.269> they<00:00:59.539> would<00:00:59.840> have<00:00:59.930> some<00:01:00.140> of<00:01:00.230> the

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:00.289 
features they would have some of the

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:01.660 
features they would have some of the
features<00:01:00.469> we<00:01:00.710> wanted<00:01:01.010> but<00:01:01.160> not<00:01:01.280> necessarily

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
features we wanted but not necessarily

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.520 
features we wanted but not necessarily
all<00:01:01.850> the<00:01:02.000> features<00:01:02.149> that<00:01:02.359> we<00:01:02.570> wanted<00:01:02.899> and<00:01:03.050> then

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
all the features that we wanted and then

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.950 
all the features that we wanted and then
one<00:01:03.649> of<00:01:03.679> the<00:01:03.829> biggest<00:01:04.010> things<00:01:04.370> that<00:01:04.720> Pro<00:01:05.720> Court

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
one of the biggest things that Pro Court

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.730 
one of the biggest things that Pro Court
offered<00:01:06.260> us<00:01:06.410> was<00:01:06.940> the<00:01:08.050> ability<00:01:09.050> to<00:01:09.350> get<00:01:09.500> other

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
offered us was the ability to get other

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.550 
offered us was the ability to get other
users<00:01:10.340> sub<00:01:10.670> contractors<00:01:11.299> consultants<00:01:11.990> owners

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
users sub contractors consultants owners

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.070 
users sub contractors consultants owners
on<00:01:12.860> board<00:01:13.280> and<00:01:13.460> access<00:01:13.850> to<00:01:14.090> it<00:01:14.240> that<00:01:14.540> typically

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
on board and access to it that typically

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.190 
on board and access to it that typically
is<00:01:15.590> much<00:01:16.490> more<00:01:16.700> cumbersome<00:01:17.180> and<00:01:17.360> costly<00:01:17.689> with

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
is much more cumbersome and costly with

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.360 
is much more cumbersome and costly with
a<00:01:18.229> lot<00:01:18.409> of<00:01:18.439> the<00:01:18.560> other<00:01:18.710> platforms

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:22.370 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.219 

I'd<00:01:23.370> say<00:01:23.550> the<00:01:23.700> biggest<00:01:23.729> success<00:01:24.570> story<00:01:24.870> was

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
I'd say the biggest success story was

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.050 
I'd say the biggest success story was
just<00:01:25.680> how<00:01:26.070> quickly<00:01:26.250> everyone<00:01:26.610> was<00:01:26.820> able<00:01:26.909> to

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
just how quickly everyone was able to

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.700 
just how quickly everyone was able to
get<00:01:27.180> up<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.360> running<00:01:27.420> on<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:28.350> didn't

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
get up and running on it it didn't

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.500 
get up and running on it it didn't
create<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.460> lot<00:01:29.610> of<00:01:29.640> downtime<00:01:29.880> for<00:01:30.360> our

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.510 
create a lot of downtime for our

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.020 
create a lot of downtime for our
employees<00:01:30.750> at<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.290> time<00:01:31.700> they<00:01:32.700> were<00:01:32.729> able<00:01:32.970> to

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
employees at the time they were able to

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.969 
employees at the time they were able to
get<00:01:33.120> into<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:33.570> I<00:01:33.810> would<00:01:34.140> say<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.530> support

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
get into it I would say the support

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.910 
get into it I would say the support
system<00:01:35.340> from<00:01:35.490> pro<00:01:35.700> quo<00:01:35.940> was<00:01:36.210> phenomenal<00:01:37.200> it

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
system from pro quo was phenomenal it

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.770 
system from pro quo was phenomenal it
really<00:01:38.369> really<00:01:38.790> into<00:01:39.119> this<00:01:39.240> day<00:01:39.479> not<00:01:39.750> even

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
really really into this day not even

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.960 
really really into this day not even
just<00:01:40.619> in<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.830> initial<00:01:40.979> training<00:01:41.520> but<00:01:41.670> in<00:01:41.790> the

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
just in the initial training but in the

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.690 
just in the initial training but in the
follow-up<00:01:42.860> support<00:01:43.860> phone<00:01:44.009> calls<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.369> emails

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
follow-up support phone calls and emails

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.880 
follow-up support phone calls and emails
has<00:01:45.600> really<00:01:45.990> been<00:01:46.140> one<00:01:46.290> of<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.470> I'd<00:01:46.619> say<00:01:46.770> the

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
has really been one of the I'd say the

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.200 
has really been one of the I'd say the
greatest<00:01:47.250> success<00:01:47.520> story<00:01:47.759> says<00:01:47.880> it<00:01:48.000> allows<00:01:48.180> us

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
greatest success story says it allows us

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.440 
greatest success story says it allows us
to<00:01:48.540> be<00:01:48.630> successful<00:01:48.780> with<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.410> software<00:01:49.800> um

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
to be successful with the software um

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.330 
to be successful with the software um
and<00:01:51.450> then<00:01:51.840> I<00:01:51.869> think<00:01:52.080> proper<00:01:52.710> also<00:01:52.979> just<00:01:53.190> has

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
and then I think proper also just has

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.630 
and then I think proper also just has
really<00:01:53.670> enabled<00:01:53.850> us<00:01:54.119> to<00:01:54.180> jump<00:01:54.660> right<00:01:55.050> in<00:01:55.640> part

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
really enabled us to jump right in part

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.400 
really enabled us to jump right in part
of<00:01:56.700> that's<00:01:56.820> because<00:01:57.149> it<00:01:57.270> easy<00:01:57.479> use<00:01:57.840> but<00:01:58.170> the

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:58.410 
of that's because it easy use but the

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.499 
of that's because it easy use but the
ease<00:01:58.590> of<00:01:58.619> use<00:01:58.979> for<00:01:59.250> other<00:01:59.430> people<00:01:59.910> using<00:02:00.390> it

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
ease of use for other people using it

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.540 
ease of use for other people using it

younger company on can bring a level of

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:36.070 
younger company on can bring a level of
sophistication<00:06:34.160> to<00:06:34.760> a<00:06:34.880> job<00:06:35.210> and<00:06:35.510> pro<00:06:35.840> core

sophistication to a job and pro core

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.320 
sophistication to a job and pro core
definitely<00:06:36.500> shows<00:06:37.220> that<00:06:37.460> and<00:06:37.669> it's<00:06:37.760> easy<00:06:38.120> to

guys are always looking to better it and

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:48.040 
guys are always looking to better it and
improve<00:07:46.550> it<00:07:46.910> and<00:07:47.030> there's<00:07:47.210> constant<00:07:47.660> updates

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:48.050 
improve it and there's constant updates

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:49.990 
improve it and there's constant updates
and<00:07:48.290> they're<00:07:48.380> not<00:07:48.500> once<00:07:48.890> a<00:07:49.040> year<00:07:49.340> or<00:07:49.520> every<00:07:49.640> six

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:50.000 
and they're not once a year or every six
