quarter<00:00:42.130> pedal<00:00:42.489> shifts<00:00:43.239> the<00:00:43.360> whole<00:00:43.390> keyboard

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:43.900 
quarter pedal shifts the whole keyboard

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.080 
quarter pedal shifts the whole keyboard
to<00:00:44.200> the<00:00:44.230> right<00:00:44.500> leading<00:00:45.190> to<00:00:45.370> a<00:00:45.400> softer<00:00:45.850> sound

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.090 
to the right leading to a softer sound

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.479 
to the right leading to a softer sound
so<00:00:46.960> the<00:00:47.080> left<00:00:47.290> pedal<00:00:47.470> is<00:00:47.710> also<00:00:48.040> called<00:00:48.250> the

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:48.489 
so the left pedal is also called the

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:50.250 
so the left pedal is also called the
soft<00:00:48.730> pedal<00:00:49.030> you<00:00:49.780> can<00:00:49.809> find<00:00:50.140> the

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260 
soft pedal you can find the

articulations in the anatomy menu let's
start<00:00:53.260> with<00:00:53.379> half<00:00:53.590> pedaling

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
start with half pedaling

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.640 
start with half pedaling
no<00:00:55.790> peddling<00:00:56.780> in<00:00:56.900> classical<00:00:57.260> music<00:00:57.380> and

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:57.650 
no peddling in classical music and

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.500 
no peddling in classical music and
especially<00:00:57.980> half<00:00:58.370> pedaling<00:00:58.940> is<00:00:59.090> an<00:00:59.240> art<00:00:59.420> of

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
especially half pedaling is an art of

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.330 
especially half pedaling is an art of
its<00:00:59.630> own<00:00:59.840> Chopin<00:01:00.470> used<00:01:00.680> a<00:01:00.800> lot<00:01:01.040> of<00:01:01.190> half

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
its own Chopin used a lot of half

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:02.980 
its own Chopin used a lot of half
pedaling<00:01:01.730> in<00:01:01.820> his<00:01:01.940> music<00:01:02.330> and<00:01:02.420> in<00:01:02.540> fact<00:01:02.780> his

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:02.990 
pedaling in his music and in fact his

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:04.390 
pedaling in his music and in fact his
students<00:01:03.320> were<00:01:03.380> even<00:01:03.590> known<00:01:03.770> to<00:01:03.920> lie<00:01:04.160> on<00:01:04.309> the

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
students were even known to lie on the

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.340 
students were even known to lie on the
floor<00:01:04.430> and<00:01:04.879> watch<00:01:05.030> his<00:01:05.239> foot<00:01:05.510> move<00:01:05.750> so<00:01:06.230> they

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
floor and watch his foot move so they

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:07.540 
floor and watch his foot move so they
could<00:01:06.470> understand<00:01:06.920> better<00:01:07.070> the<00:01:07.280> art<00:01:07.430> of

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:07.550 
could understand better the art of

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.550 
could understand better the art of
pedaling<00:01:07.910> Beethoven<00:01:08.810> also<00:01:09.050> intended<00:01:09.350> the<00:01:09.440> use

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
pedaling Beethoven also intended the use

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.860 
pedaling Beethoven also intended the use
of<00:01:09.740> half<00:01:09.890> pedal<00:01:10.160> of<00:01:10.250> many<00:01:10.400> of<00:01:10.490> his<00:01:10.640> sonatas<00:01:11.180> now

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:11.870 
of half pedal of many of his sonatas now

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.630 
of half pedal of many of his sonatas now
what<00:01:12.470> is<00:01:12.560> the<00:01:12.650> difference<00:01:12.800> between<00:01:13.040> half

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
what is the difference between half

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.690 
what is the difference between half
pedaling<00:01:14.120> and<00:01:14.300> ordinary<00:01:14.869> pedaling<00:01:15.350> a<00:01:15.700> damper

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
pedaling and ordinary pedaling a damper

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010 
pedal on a real piano works continuously

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.400 
pedal on a real piano works continuously
the<00:01:19.670> further<00:01:19.910> down<00:01:20.210> you<00:01:20.390> press<00:01:20.660> the<00:01:20.869> pedal<00:01:21.229> the

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:21.410 
the further down you press the pedal the

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.440 
the further down you press the pedal the
more<00:01:21.979> lifts<00:01:22.369> the<00:01:22.490> dampers<00:01:22.850> from<00:01:23.030> the<00:01:23.119> string

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
more lifts the dampers from the string

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.359 
more lifts the dampers from the string
and<00:01:23.780> the<00:01:24.380> more<00:01:24.590> the<00:01:24.710> dampers<00:01:25.040> leave<00:01:25.250> the

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
and the more the dampers leave the

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:27.430 
and the more the dampers leave the
string<00:01:25.640> free<00:01:25.940> to<00:01:26.060> vibrate<00:01:26.570> the<00:01:26.810> more<00:01:26.990> sustain

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:27.440 
string free to vibrate the more sustain

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.740 
string free to vibrate the more sustain
and<00:01:27.740> resonance<00:01:28.250> you<00:01:28.369> can<00:01:28.520> achieve<00:01:28.820> so<00:01:29.450> you<00:01:29.509> can

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
and resonance you can achieve so you can

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.450 
and resonance you can achieve so you can
control<00:01:30.170> all<00:01:30.500> these<00:01:30.649> parameters<00:01:31.280> with<00:01:31.430> the

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
control all these parameters with the

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.380 
control all these parameters with the
exact<00:01:32.000> position<00:01:32.509> of<00:01:32.600> the<00:01:32.660> damper<00:01:33.050> pedal<00:01:34.390> now

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390

most<00:01:35.630> electronic<00:01:36.290> sustain<00:01:36.740> pedals<00:01:37.190> are<00:01:37.460> just

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
most electronic sustain pedals are just

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.570 
most electronic sustain pedals are just
a<00:01:38.000> switch<00:01:38.270> either<00:01:38.630> on<00:01:38.960> or<00:01:39.290> off<00:01:39.380> so<00:01:40.340> when<00:01:40.490> you

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
a switch either on or off so when you

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:41.980 
a switch either on or off so when you
slowly<00:01:40.790> press<00:01:41.090> them<00:01:41.240> down<00:01:41.270> they<00:01:41.570> just<00:01:41.600> reach<00:01:41.869> a

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
slowly press them down they just reach a

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.690 
slowly press them down they just reach a
point<00:01:42.170> where<00:01:42.380> they<00:01:42.470> suddenly<00:01:42.710> turn<00:01:43.040> on<00:01:43.220> but

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
point where they suddenly turn on but

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.219 
point where they suddenly turn on but
with<00:01:43.820> Galaxies<00:01:44.240> pianos<00:01:44.570> this<00:01:44.750> is<00:01:44.899> different

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
with Galaxies pianos this is different

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:46.749 
with Galaxies pianos this is different
if<00:01:45.320> you're<00:01:45.440> using<00:01:45.590> a<00:01:45.770> continuous<00:01:46.280> sustain

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
if you're using a continuous sustain

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:48.910 
if you're using a continuous sustain
pedal<00:01:47.210> we<00:01:47.570> have<00:01:47.690> the<00:01:47.780> capability<00:01:48.380> now<00:01:48.560> of

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
pedal we have the capability now of

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.070 
pedal we have the capability now of
using<00:01:49.310> half<00:01:49.520> pedaling<00:01:50.060> so<00:01:50.479> let's<00:01:50.720> switch<00:01:50.810> the

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
using half pedaling so let's switch the

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.610 
using half pedaling so let's switch the
half<00:01:51.229> pedaling<00:01:51.619> function<00:01:51.979> on

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:54.620 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.080 

so<00:01:55.620> now<00:01:55.800> I'm<00:01:55.860> gonna<00:01:55.980> play<00:01:56.190> a<00:01:56.220> series<00:01:56.640> of<00:01:56.670> short

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
so now I'm gonna play a series of short

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.330 
so now I'm gonna play a series of short
notes<00:01:57.330> and<00:01:57.630> slowly<00:01:58.020> press<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.590> sustain<00:01:58.980> pedal

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
notes and slowly press the sustain pedal

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:10.460 
notes and slowly press the sustain pedal
down<00:02:08.030> so<00:02:09.030> as<00:02:09.180> you<00:02:09.300> can<00:02:09.420> hear<00:02:09.869> as<00:02:10.080> I<00:02:10.229> push<00:02:10.440> the

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
down so as you can hear as I push the

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.900 
down so as you can hear as I push the
pedal<00:02:10.860> down<00:02:10.890> we<00:02:11.310> get<00:02:11.430> more<00:02:11.700> and<00:02:11.850> more

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
pedal down we get more and more

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.000 
pedal down we get more and more
resonance<00:02:12.540> and<00:02:12.750> longer<00:02:13.080> and<00:02:13.170> longer<00:02:13.230> sustain

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
resonance and longer and longer sustain

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.070 
resonance and longer and longer sustain
now<00:02:14.640> this<00:02:14.820> works<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.210> other<00:02:15.240> way<00:02:15.480> around<00:02:15.600> as

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
now this works the other way around as

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.120 
now this works the other way around as
well<00:02:16.230> I'll<00:02:16.410> push<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.710> pedal<00:02:16.950> all<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.040> way

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
well I'll push the pedal all the way

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:28.550 
well I'll push the pedal all the way
down<00:02:17.370> and<00:02:17.610> slowly<00:02:17.820> lift<00:02:18.060> it<00:02:18.240> up<00:02:26.930> so<00:02:27.930> galaxy

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
down and slowly lift it up so galaxy

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.860 
down and slowly lift it up so galaxy
pianos<00:02:29.010> offers<00:02:29.670> true<00:02:29.910> half<00:02:30.120> pedaling<00:02:30.660> so

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
pianos offers true half pedaling so

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.180 
pianos offers true half pedaling so
let's<00:02:31.140> hear<00:02:31.230> all<00:02:31.290> this<00:02:31.560> with<00:02:31.740> a<00:02:31.770> little<00:02:32.010> bit<00:02:32.100> of

let's hear all this with a little bit of

00:02:32.190 --> 00:03:10.840 
let's hear all this with a little bit of
music

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:17.830

release<00:03:25.640> time<00:03:25.970> we<00:03:26.510> covered<00:03:26.810> release<00:03:27.110> time<00:03:27.410> in

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
release time we covered release time in

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.860 
release time we covered release time in
the<00:03:27.650> noises<00:03:27.860> tutorial<00:03:28.550> so<00:03:29.120> the<00:03:29.300> release<00:03:29.600> time

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
the noises tutorial so the release time

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.720 
the noises tutorial so the release time
is<00:03:30.110> the<00:03:30.260> time<00:03:30.500> that<00:03:30.530> the<00:03:30.830> note<00:03:31.010> needs<00:03:31.280> to<00:03:31.490> die

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
is the time that the note needs to die

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.730 
is the time that the note needs to die
off<00:03:32.000> after<00:03:32.570> you<00:03:32.660> strike<00:03:32.990> it<00:03:33.020> if<00:03:33.320> I<00:03:33.410> strike<00:03:33.680> a

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:33.740 
off after you strike it if I strike a

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.820 
off after you strike it if I strike a
note<00:03:34.510> it<00:03:35.510> takes<00:03:35.780> a<00:03:35.900> little<00:03:36.080> while<00:03:36.290> to<00:03:36.350> die<00:03:36.680> off

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
note it takes a little while to die off

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.470 
note it takes a little while to die off
because<00:03:37.040> there's<00:03:37.340> so<00:03:37.550> much<00:03:37.700> energy<00:03:38.240> in<00:03:38.360> the

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
because there's so much energy in the

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.330 
because there's so much energy in the
strings<00:03:38.810> that<00:03:39.290> the<00:03:39.440> damper<00:03:39.710> can't<00:03:39.920> stop<00:03:40.160> it

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
strings that the damper can't stop it

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.240 
strings that the damper can't stop it
right<00:03:40.490> away<00:03:40.730> now<00:03:41.510> if<00:03:41.810> I<00:03:42.440> press<00:03:42.740> the<00:03:42.770> pedal

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
right away now if I press the pedal

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.190 
right away now if I press the pedal
during<00:03:43.550> this<00:03:43.880> dying<00:03:44.210> off<00:03:44.510> time<00:03:44.840> then<00:03:45.020> we<00:03:45.110> get

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
during this dying off time then we get

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.710 
during this dying off time then we get

reap edling first let me play it for you

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.330 
reap edling first let me play it for you
a<00:03:47.750> few<00:03:47.960> times<00:03:48.170> this<00:03:48.470> note<00:03:48.680> I'll<00:03:48.890> play<00:03:49.040> a<00:03:49.070> very

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
a few times this note I'll play a very

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.160 
a few times this note I'll play a very
short<00:03:49.730> without<00:03:49.970> petal<00:03:50.630> now<00:03:52.450> with<00:03:53.450> petal

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
short without petal now with petal

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.120 
short without petal now with petal
I'm<00:03:54.230> already<00:03:54.530> pressing<00:03:54.830> the<00:03:55.010> pedal

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
I'm already pressing the pedal

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.490 
I'm already pressing the pedal
then<00:03:57.790> we<00:03:57.880> get<00:03:57.970> full<00:03:58.180> sustained<00:03:58.660> now<00:03:59.230> I'm<00:03:59.350> going

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
then we get full sustained now I'm going

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.470 
then we get full sustained now I'm going
to<00:03:59.590> press<00:03:59.800> the<00:03:59.950> pedal<00:04:00.280> during<00:04:00.700> the<00:04:01.000> dying<00:04:01.240> off

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
to press the pedal during the dying off

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.450 
to press the pedal during the dying off
time

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:04.460 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:06.860 

then<00:04:05.460> it<00:04:05.580> holds<00:04:05.880> only<00:04:06.000> what's<00:04:06.300> remaining<00:04:06.630> of

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
then it holds only what's remaining of

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.040 
then it holds only what's remaining of
the<00:04:06.990> note<00:04:07.700> now<00:04:08.700> the<00:04:08.760> bass<00:04:09.030> notes<00:04:09.390> have<00:04:09.810> a<00:04:09.840> much

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
the note now the bass notes have a much

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.260 
the note now the bass notes have a much
longer<00:04:10.230> release<00:04:10.680> phase<00:04:11.040> than<00:04:11.490> do<00:04:11.700> the<00:04:11.880> middle

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.270 
longer release phase than do the middle

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:15.170 
longer release phase than do the middle
range<00:04:12.540> or<00:04:12.900> the<00:04:13.050> upper<00:04:13.440> ranges<00:04:13.860> so<00:04:14.460> when<00:04:15.060> you're

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
range or the upper ranges so when you're

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.940 
range or the upper ranges so when you're
using<00:04:15.600> reap<00:04:16.110> edelyn<00:04:16.470> you'll<00:04:16.590> notice<00:04:16.830> the

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
using reap edelyn you'll notice the

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.070 
using reap edelyn you'll notice the
effect<00:04:17.190> much<00:04:17.370> more<00:04:17.610> in<00:04:17.700> the<00:04:17.790> bass<00:04:17.940> range<00:04:18.269> now

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:19.080 
effect much more in the bass range now

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.570 
effect much more in the bass range now
let's<00:04:19.290> talk<00:04:19.380> about<00:04:19.440> the<00:04:19.709> middle<00:04:19.950> pedal<00:04:20.130> this

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:20.580 
let's talk about the middle pedal this

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:23.360 
let's talk about the middle pedal this
is<00:04:20.730> also<00:04:20.940> known<00:04:21.299> as<00:04:21.600> the<00:04:21.900> sostenuto<00:04:22.110> pedal<00:04:22.440> it

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
is also known as the sostenuto pedal it

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.030 
is also known as the sostenuto pedal it
works<00:04:23.610> similarly<00:04:24.210> to<00:04:24.690> the<00:04:24.870> sustain<00:04:25.410> pedal<00:04:25.860> and

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
works similarly to the sustain pedal and

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.400 
works similarly to the sustain pedal and
that<00:04:26.190> it<00:04:26.340> lifts<00:04:27.240> the<00:04:27.420> dampers<00:04:28.140> from<00:04:28.320> the

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
that it lifts the dampers from the

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.560 
that it lifts the dampers from the
strings<00:04:28.740> but<00:04:29.400> it<00:04:29.520> only<00:04:29.640> lists<00:04:30.000> those<00:04:30.120> dampers

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
strings but it only lists those dampers

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.210 
strings but it only lists those dampers
of<00:04:30.780> the<00:04:31.260> keys<00:04:31.470> which<00:04:31.680> you<00:04:31.800> are<00:04:31.860> currently

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
of the keys which you are currently

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.980 
of the keys which you are currently
pressing<00:04:32.730> so<00:04:32.910> I'm<00:04:33.000> gonna<00:04:33.090> press<00:04:33.390> down<00:04:33.450> three

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
pressing so I'm gonna press down three

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.920 
pressing so I'm gonna press down three
notes<00:04:34.580> silently<00:04:35.580> and<00:04:35.850> then<00:04:36.210> press<00:04:36.480> the<00:04:36.780> middle

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
notes silently and then press the middle

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:43.400 
notes silently and then press the middle
pedal<00:04:40.790> so<00:04:41.790> only<00:04:42.210> those<00:04:42.570> three<00:04:42.810> notes<00:04:43.110> are

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
pedal so only those three notes are

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:48.230 
pedal so only those three notes are
sounding<00:04:44.750> this<00:04:45.750> works<00:04:46.050> very<00:04:46.380> well<00:04:47.040> for<00:04:47.580> lots

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
sounding this works very well for lots

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.450 
sounding this works very well for lots
of<00:04:48.360> pieces<00:04:48.720> for<00:04:49.110> Debussy<00:04:49.560> let's<00:04:49.830> try<00:04:50.070> it<00:04:50.130> here

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
of pieces for Debussy let's try it here

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.970 
of pieces for Debussy let's try it here
I'm<00:04:50.640> gonna<00:04:50.820> press<00:04:51.450> down<00:04:51.480> two<00:04:51.870> notes<00:04:52.110> and<00:04:52.500> then

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 
I'm gonna press down two notes and then

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.220 
I'm gonna press down two notes and then
the<00:04:53.040> middle<00:04:53.250> pedal<00:04:53.400> now<00:04:54.030> that<00:04:54.240> will<00:04:55.110> be

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:55.230 
the middle pedal now that will be

00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:09.690 
the middle pedal now that will be
sustained<00:04:55.770> and<00:04:56.130> the<00:04:56.490> others<00:04:56.730> won't<00:04:56.910> be

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:09.700 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.190 

so<00:05:10.700> as<00:05:10.760> you<00:05:10.880> see<00:05:11.090> it's<00:05:11.180> a<00:05:11.270> very<00:05:11.300> useful<00:05:11.660> pedal

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:12.200 
so as you see it's a very useful pedal

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.730 
so as you see it's a very useful pedal
now<00:05:12.860> let's<00:05:13.070> talk<00:05:13.190> about<00:05:13.250> silent<00:05:14.120> key<00:05:14.740> first

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740 
now let's talk about silent key first

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.700 
now let's talk about silent key first
let's<00:05:16.010> activate<00:05:16.400> silent<00:05:16.970> key<00:05:17.500> now<00:05:18.500> on<00:05:18.680> a

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
let's activate silent key now on a

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.290 
let's activate silent key now on a
normal<00:05:19.040> keyboard<00:05:19.370> when<00:05:19.760> you<00:05:19.850> press<00:05:20.000> the<00:05:20.120> keys

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
normal keyboard when you press the keys

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.150 
normal keyboard when you press the keys
very<00:05:20.570> slowly<00:05:20.900> it'll<00:05:21.140> send<00:05:21.350> out<00:05:21.470> a<00:05:21.500> MIDI<00:05:21.740> signal

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 
very slowly it'll send out a MIDI signal

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.100 
very slowly it'll send out a MIDI signal
of<00:05:22.280> one<00:05:22.580> and<00:05:22.910> then<00:05:23.150> you<00:05:23.240> will<00:05:23.330> hear<00:05:23.510> us<00:05:23.660> a<00:05:23.690> very

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
of one and then you will hear us a very

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.770 
of one and then you will hear us a very
quiet<00:05:24.350> sound<00:05:24.740> but<00:05:25.430> here<00:05:25.730> it's<00:05:25.910> truly<00:05:26.300> silent

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780 
quiet sound but here it's truly silent

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:28.960 
quiet sound but here it's truly silent
but<00:05:27.170> what<00:05:27.320> it<00:05:27.410> does<00:05:27.620> is<00:05:27.980> it<00:05:28.190> lifts<00:05:28.490> the<00:05:28.610> virtual

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:28.970 
but what it does is it lifts the virtual

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:30.760 
but what it does is it lifts the virtual
dampers<00:05:29.390> allowing<00:05:29.810> the<00:05:29.930> strings<00:05:30.230> to<00:05:30.440> vibrate

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
dampers allowing the strings to vibrate

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:33.040 
dampers allowing the strings to vibrate
freely<00:05:31.010> so<00:05:31.730> if<00:05:31.850> I<00:05:31.940> play<00:05:32.120> the<00:05:32.330> other<00:05:32.480> notes<00:05:32.750> it

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.050 
freely so if I play the other notes it

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:34.600 
freely so if I play the other notes it
will<00:05:33.140> actually<00:05:33.350> cause<00:05:33.740> these<00:05:34.070> strings<00:05:34.430> to

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:34.610 
will actually cause these strings to

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:41.880 
will actually cause these strings to
vibrate<00:05:35.060> through<00:05:35.600> sympathetic<00:05:36.140> resonance

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:41.890 

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:44.710 

that's<00:05:42.890> the<00:05:43.040> silent<00:05:43.430> key<00:05:43.550> function<00:05:44.000> now<00:05:44.450> let's

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:44.720 
that's the silent key function now let's

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.450 
that's the silent key function now let's
talk<00:05:44.840> about<00:05:44.900> the<00:05:45.200> UNA<00:05:45.500> Corda<00:05:45.530> function<00:05:46.340> we

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:46.460 
talk about the UNA Corda function we

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.370 
talk about the UNA Corda function we
need<00:05:46.580> to<00:05:46.640> activate<00:05:47.150> this<00:05:47.360> as<00:05:47.600> well

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:48.380 
need to activate this as well

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.710 
need to activate this as well
now<00:05:49.100> I'm<00:05:49.550> gonna<00:05:49.700> describe<00:05:50.090> to<00:05:50.300> you<00:05:50.390> how<00:05:50.420> it

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 
now I'm gonna describe to you how it

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.350 
now I'm gonna describe to you how it
works<00:05:50.980> when<00:05:51.980> you<00:05:52.010> press<00:05:52.280> the<00:05:52.430> soft<00:05:52.700> pedal<00:05:53.000> all

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.360 
works when you press the soft pedal all

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.690 
works when you press the soft pedal all
the<00:05:53.420> keys<00:05:54.170> shifts<00:05:54.530> slightly<00:05:54.740> to<00:05:55.040> the<00:05:55.070> right<00:05:55.370> so

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:55.700 
the keys shifts slightly to the right so

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.700 
the keys shifts slightly to the right so
that<00:05:55.730> in<00:05:55.970> the<00:05:56.060> upper<00:05:56.360> bass<00:05:56.540> register<00:05:56.840> the

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:57.710 
that in the upper bass register the

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:59.260 
that in the upper bass register the
Hammers<00:05:58.100> strike<00:05:58.430> only<00:05:58.610> one<00:05:58.910> of<00:05:59.030> the<00:05:59.090> two

00:05:59.260 --> 00:05:59.270 
Hammers strike only one of the two

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:01.630 
Hammers strike only one of the two
strings<00:05:59.660> and<00:06:00.020> in<00:06:00.500> the<00:06:00.590> treble<00:06:00.830> the<00:06:01.190> hammer

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:01.640 
strings and in the treble the hammer

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.710 
strings and in the treble the hammer
strike<00:06:01.970> only<00:06:02.150> two<00:06:02.450> of<00:06:02.570> the<00:06:02.660> three<00:06:02.690> strings<00:06:03.370> and

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:04.720 
strike only two of the three strings and

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.330 
strike only two of the three strings and
because<00:06:05.720> fewer<00:06:06.230> strings<00:06:06.620> are<00:06:06.800> being<00:06:06.920> struck

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:07.340 
because fewer strings are being struck

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.160 
because fewer strings are being struck
by<00:06:07.370> each<00:06:07.760> key<00:06:08.120> this<00:06:08.540> leads<00:06:08.780> to<00:06:08.870> a<00:06:08.960> very

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:09.170 
by each key this leads to a very

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:11.440 
by each key this leads to a very
different<00:06:09.440> sound<00:06:09.770> and<00:06:10.130> in<00:06:10.520> addition<00:06:10.970> the

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:11.450 
different sound and in addition the

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:13.540 
different sound and in addition the
Hammers<00:06:11.900> which<00:06:12.110> are<00:06:12.260> shifted<00:06:13.130> to<00:06:13.220> the<00:06:13.340> right

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:13.550 
Hammers which are shifted to the right

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.130 
Hammers which are shifted to the right
are<00:06:13.850> using<00:06:14.270> the<00:06:14.360> less<00:06:14.510> used<00:06:14.720> part<00:06:15.020> of<00:06:15.080> the

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:15.140 
are using the less used part of the

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:17.680 
are using the less used part of the
hammer<00:06:15.410> which<00:06:15.710> also<00:06:16.130> changes<00:06:16.490> the<00:06:16.640> sound<00:06:16.820> now

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:17.690 
hammer which also changes the sound now

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:19.240 
hammer which also changes the sound now
this<00:06:17.990> is<00:06:18.110> the<00:06:18.200> reason<00:06:18.380> we've<00:06:18.650> actually<00:06:18.860> made

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:19.250 
this is the reason we've actually made

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:20.950 
this is the reason we've actually made
samples<00:06:19.880> of<00:06:20.000> all<00:06:20.120> the<00:06:20.150> wound<00:06:20.390> Acorah

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:20.960 
samples of all the wound Acorah

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.720 
samples of all the wound Acorah
instead<00:06:21.470> of<00:06:21.560> just<00:06:21.740> using<00:06:21.890> filtering<00:06:22.550> or

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:22.730 
instead of just using filtering or

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:24.460 
instead of just using filtering or
modeling<00:06:23.270> I'm<00:06:23.690> gonna<00:06:23.900> give<00:06:24.110> you<00:06:24.170> an<00:06:24.230> example

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:24.470 
modeling I'm gonna give you an example

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:25.780 
modeling I'm gonna give you an example
what<00:06:24.710> the<00:06:24.830> sounds<00:06:25.190> like<00:06:25.310> I'll<00:06:25.520> play<00:06:25.670> a<00:06:25.700> little

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:25.790 
what the sounds like I'll play a little

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:33.800 
what the sounds like I'll play a little
bit<00:06:26.060> of<00:06:26.120> Japan<00:06:26.480> without<00:06:26.990> the<00:06:27.470> UNA<00:06:27.770> Corda

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:33.810 

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:37.590 

now<00:06:34.810> with<00:06:35.530> the<00:06:35.950> left<00:06:36.130> pedal<00:06:36.400> so<00:06:36.820> we<00:06:37.000> have<00:06:37.180> una

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:37.600 
now with the left pedal so we have una

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:43.689 
now with the left pedal so we have una
Corda

00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:43.699 

00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:46.610 

so<00:06:44.699> you<00:06:44.759> see<00:06:44.940> it<00:06:45.060> sounds<00:06:45.300> quite<00:06:45.509> different<00:06:45.900> so

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:46.620 
so you see it sounds quite different so

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:48.589 
so you see it sounds quite different so
that'll<00:06:47.099> be<00:06:47.159> it<00:06:47.310> for<00:06:47.550> our<00:06:47.699> articulations

00:06:48.589 --> 00:06:48.599 
that'll be it for our articulations

00:06:48.599 --> 00:06:50.689 
that'll be it for our articulations
tutorial<00:06:49.259> thank<00:06:49.500> you<00:06:49.590> very<00:06:49.710> much<00:06:49.979> and<00:06:50.280> see<00:06:50.669> you
