 principal in production although it sounds 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.139
 strange in some youtube videos there 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:40.800
 tutorials that explain you the 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:43.680
 preparation of this curious drink 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:46.830

 It is distributed all over the world although 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:10.830
 this has not only been seen in beers 

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:13.050
 there is a vodka called hell that 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:15.180
 It promises a spicy flavor but with a 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:19.280
 curious decoration inside two 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.280
 chiles that keeps the spicy flavor 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:25.340

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:27.620
 curious flavored vodka Bacon A 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:30.800

 orange or lemons 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:45.280
 now I will show you what I consider the 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.280
 the most disgusting and weird wine in the world 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:52.139
 the drink in question is called baby 

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:55.800
 house and that is for sale in Korea and 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:59.280
 china this curious and strange drink is 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:01.560
 translates as mouse baby wine like this 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.659
 it is a combination of rice wine 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:06.000
 traditional china and a dozen 

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:08.009
 little mice that are removed from their 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.099
 mother days before they open their eyes 

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:13.319
 to add them to the wine it should be stressed 

00:06:11.099 --> 00:06:16.259
 that this is not the only wine that 

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:17.969
 prepare with animals we also find 

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:22.830
 wines with infusions of lizards 

00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:26.219

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:37.080
 Finally, you can not miss mentioning the 

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:41.820
 giant centipede whiskey that 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:44.220
 manufactures in Thailand without a doubt these 

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:47.460
 latest alcoholic drinks are the most 

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:50.070
 strange of the world if you thought that all 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:52.820
 the beers and wines had the same 

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:55.410

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:58.050
 as you can always leave me a 

00:06:55.410 --> 00:07:01.620
