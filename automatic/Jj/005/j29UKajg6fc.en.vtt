my tactical is the black cat which is
very<00:01:25.890> is<00:01:26.130> quite<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.369> strange<00:01:26.640> setup<00:01:26.880> really<00:01:27.299> but

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
very is quite a strange setup really but

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.690 
very is quite a strange setup really but
it<00:01:27.750> works<00:01:27.960> perfectly<00:01:28.530> now<00:01:28.799> let's<00:01:29.490> go<00:01:29.610> ahead

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
it works perfectly now let's go ahead

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.120 
it works perfectly now let's go ahead
and<00:01:29.850> break<00:01:30.090> it<00:01:30.240> down<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.450> bit<00:01:30.570> for<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:30.990> so<00:01:31.979> the

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
and break it down a bit for you so the

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.520 
and break it down a bit for you so the
reason<00:01:32.280> I<00:01:32.549> chose<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.909> MSMC<00:01:33.270> was<00:01:33.689> because<00:01:34.020> in

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
reason I chose the MSMC was because in

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.649 
reason I chose the MSMC was because in
all<00:01:34.710> honesty<00:01:34.799> it's<00:01:35.790> my<00:01:35.939> favorite<00:01:36.210> sub<00:01:36.360> machine

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
all honesty it's my favorite sub machine

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.899 
all honesty it's my favorite sub machine
gun<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.020> in<00:01:37.470> pretty<00:01:37.710> much<00:01:37.799> any<00:01:38.130> gun<00:01:38.579> fight<00:01:38.880> I

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909

gun and in pretty much any gun fight I
can<00:01:39.240> guarantee<00:01:39.630> it<00:01:40.079> will<00:01:40.560> pretty<00:01:40.829> much<00:01:40.950> outgun

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
can guarantee it will pretty much outgun

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.520 
can guarantee it will pretty much outgun
the<00:01:41.670> opposition's<00:01:42.180> gonna<00:01:42.390> no<00:01:42.869> gun<00:01:43.170> actually

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
the opposition's gonna no gun actually

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.260 
the opposition's gonna no gun actually
out<00:01:43.619> guns<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:44.189> even<00:01:44.640> if<00:01:44.729> you<00:01:44.820> have<00:01:44.970> a<00:01:45.000> higher

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
out guns it even if you have a higher

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.090 
out guns it even if you have a higher
rate<00:01:45.540> of<00:01:45.570> fire<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.229> MSMC<00:01:46.560> is<00:01:46.799> just<00:01:47.009> so

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
rate of fire the MSMC is just so

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.370 
rate of fire the MSMC is just so
accurate<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.670> still<00:01:48.630> has<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.840> high<00:01:49.110> rate<00:01:49.350> of

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
accurate and still has a high rate of

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.899 
accurate and still has a high rate of
fire<00:01:49.470> you<00:01:49.799> know<00:01:49.920> it<00:01:50.070> just<00:01:50.100> literally<00:01:50.610> guns

everyone down and also it doesn't have

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.980 
everyone down and also it doesn't have
much<00:01:53.009> recoil<00:01:53.430> Eva<00:01:53.670> so<00:01:54.360> it's<00:01:54.630> pretty<00:01:54.899> much

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
much recoil Eva so it's pretty much

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.539

eotech site and now the suppressor is a

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.020 
eotech site and now the suppressor is a
very<00:02:33.810> obvious<00:02:34.110> reason<00:02:34.260> I<00:02:34.680> won't<00:02:35.430> explain<00:02:35.820> it

you<00:03:00.630> know<00:03:00.750> instead<00:03:01.140> of<00:03:01.200> having<00:03:01.500> to<00:03:01.590> a<00:03:01.770> min<00:03:02.010> and

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
you know instead of having to a min and

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.160 
you know instead of having to a min and
having<00:03:02.310> that<00:03:02.340> second<00:03:03.090> or<00:03:03.239> so<00:03:03.450> before<00:03:03.930> you

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
having that second or so before you

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.050 
having that second or so before you
actually<00:03:04.290> a<00:03:04.620> min<00:03:04.920> you<00:03:05.430> can<00:03:05.459> just<00:03:05.760> kind<00:03:05.970> of

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
actually a min you can just kind of

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.760 
actually a min you can just kind of
shoot<00:03:06.420> and<00:03:06.720> hit<00:03:06.930> far<00:03:07.170> and<00:03:07.290> be<00:03:07.350> really<00:03:07.590> accurate

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
shoot and hit far and be really accurate

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.410 
shoot and hit far and be really accurate
as<00:03:08.100> well<00:03:08.310> without<00:03:08.610> having<00:03:08.910> to<00:03:09.000> aim<00:03:09.120> it<00:03:09.239> so<00:03:09.360> it

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
as well without having to aim it so it

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.180 
as well without having to aim it so it
works<00:03:09.570> really<00:03:09.660> well<00:03:10.050> for<00:03:10.200> that<00:03:10.470> other<00:03:11.040> than

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
works really well for that other than

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.260 
works really well for that other than
that<00:03:11.430> there's<00:03:11.700> not<00:03:11.760> really<00:03:11.910> any<00:03:12.090> of<00:03:12.150> the

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
that there's not really any of the

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:13.970 
that there's not really any of the
reasons<00:03:12.630> why<00:03:12.810> I'd<00:03:12.930> use<00:03:13.110> it<00:03:13.140> I<00:03:13.410> don't<00:03:13.650> think<00:03:13.709> any

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
reasons why I'd use it I don't think any

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.160 
reasons why I'd use it I don't think any
attachments<00:03:14.610> are<00:03:14.730> used<00:03:15.180> or<00:03:15.630> are<00:03:15.660> needed

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
attachments are used or are needed

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.540 
attachments are used or are needed
really<00:03:16.410> on<00:03:16.500> the<00:03:16.590> MSMC<00:03:16.920> I<00:03:17.130> think<00:03:17.459> these

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
really on the MSMC I think these

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.610 
really on the MSMC I think these
attachment<00:03:18.150> pretty<00:03:18.840> much<00:03:18.989> cover<00:03:19.260> every

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
attachment pretty much cover every

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.440 
attachment pretty much cover every
single<00:03:19.890> situation<00:03:20.070> you<00:03:20.459> can<00:03:20.610> get<00:03:20.760> into<00:03:21.030> you

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
single situation you can get into you

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:22.940 
single situation you can get into you
know<00:03:21.570> it<00:03:21.780> could<00:03:21.900> be<00:03:22.019> at<00:03:22.140> a<00:03:22.380> long<00:03:22.920> distance

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
know it could be at a long distance

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.520 
know it could be at a long distance
could<00:03:23.580> be<00:03:23.670> a<00:03:23.700> close<00:03:23.970> distance<00:03:24.180> can<00:03:24.660> be<00:03:24.690> keeping

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
could be a close distance can be keeping

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.170 
could be a close distance can be keeping
you<00:03:25.590> off<00:03:25.650> a<00:03:25.739> mini-map<00:03:26.130> so<00:03:26.400> these<00:03:26.640> attachments

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
you off a mini-map so these attachments

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.960 
you off a mini-map so these attachments
pretty<00:03:27.360> much<00:03:27.480> cover<00:03:27.720> every<00:03:28.380> single<00:03:28.709> situation

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
pretty much cover every single situation

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.400 
pretty much cover every single situation
so<00:03:29.970> now<00:03:30.060> we'll<00:03:30.209> move<00:03:30.330> on<00:03:30.510> to<00:03:30.540> the<00:03:30.780> perks<00:03:31.080> and

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
so now we'll move on to the perks and

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.770 
so now we'll move on to the perks and
the<00:03:31.500> reason<00:03:31.830> I<00:03:31.950> use<00:03:32.190> the<00:03:32.400> ghost<00:03:32.640> perk<00:03:32.940> is<00:03:33.390> very

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
the reason I use the ghost perk is very

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.479 
the reason I use the ghost perk is very
similar<00:03:34.049> to<00:03:34.170> the<00:03:34.260> suppressor<00:03:34.739> attachment<00:03:35.340> and

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
similar to the suppressor attachment and

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:37.430 
similar to the suppressor attachment and
that<00:03:35.640> reasoning<00:03:36.150> so<00:03:36.420> i'm<00:03:36.780> sure<00:03:36.840> most<00:03:37.110> you<00:03:37.290> can

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
that reasoning so i'm sure most you can

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.590 
that reasoning so i'm sure most you can
remember<00:03:37.620> about<00:03:37.739> 30<00:03:38.100> seconds<00:03:38.519> ago<00:03:38.760> so<00:03:39.540> you

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
remember about 30 seconds ago so you

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.000 
remember about 30 seconds ago so you
last<00:03:39.989> the<00:03:40.110> reason<00:03:40.350> i<00:03:40.410> was<00:03:40.500> using<00:03:40.650> the<00:03:40.830> ghost

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
last the reason i was using the ghost

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.789 
last the reason i was using the ghost
perc<00:03:41.310> perc<00:03:41.580> two<00:03:42.450> hours<00:03:42.630> using<00:03:42.810> was<00:03:43.140> toughness

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
perc perc two hours using was toughness

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:45.560 
perc perc two hours using was toughness
and<00:03:44.010> i<00:03:44.700> think<00:03:45.000> this<00:03:45.090> is<00:03:45.150> pretty<00:03:45.330> much<00:03:45.480> a

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
and i think this is pretty much a

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.320 
and i think this is pretty much a
necessary<00:03:46.200> perk<00:03:46.920> on<00:03:47.220> any<00:03:47.580> submachine<00:03:48.180> gun

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
necessary perk on any submachine gun

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:49.910 
necessary perk on any submachine gun
especially<00:03:48.660> if<00:03:48.750> you're<00:03:48.870> rushing<00:03:49.230> the<00:03:49.650> amount

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
especially if you're rushing the amount

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.740 
especially if you're rushing the amount
of<00:03:50.010> times<00:03:50.220> that<00:03:50.340> i<00:03:50.459> die<00:03:50.580> because<00:03:51.299> of<00:03:51.330> the<00:03:51.510> kick

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
of times that i die because of the kick

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.440 
of times that i die because of the kick
when<00:03:51.959> being<00:03:52.170> shutter<00:03:52.440> is<00:03:52.769> insane<00:03:53.549> so<00:03:53.850> that's<00:03:54.390> a

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
when being shutter is insane so that's a

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.660 
when being shutter is insane so that's a
reason<00:03:54.630> I<00:03:54.660> choose<00:03:54.840> and<00:03:55.019> toughness<00:03:55.380> and<00:03:55.560> perk<00:03:56.220> 3

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
reason I choose and toughness and perk 3

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.180 
reason I choose and toughness and perk 3
I<00:03:56.850> use<00:03:57.150> dead<00:03:57.360> silence<00:03:57.810> which<00:03:58.019> isn't<00:03:58.680> used<00:03:58.980> in

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
I use dead silence which isn't used in

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.280 
I use dead silence which isn't used in
black<00:03:59.340> ops<00:03:59.459> 2<00:03:59.580> too<00:03:59.880> much<00:04:00.120> and<00:04:00.420> mainly<00:04:01.170> because

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
black ops 2 too much and mainly because

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.380 
black ops 2 too much and mainly because
no<00:04:01.470> one<00:04:02.040> can<00:04:02.280> hear<00:04:02.489> footsteps<00:04:02.700> anyway<00:04:03.209> because

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
no one can hear footsteps anyway because

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.199 
no one can hear footsteps anyway because
trapped<00:04:03.959> and<00:04:04.170> goofed<00:04:04.380> and<00:04:04.670> screwed<00:04:05.670> up<00:04:05.910> I

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
trapped and goofed and screwed up I

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:07.280 
trapped and goofed and screwed up I
don't<00:04:06.720> even<00:04:06.840> know<00:04:06.900> how<00:04:06.989> they<00:04:07.080> managed<00:04:07.260> to

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
don't even know how they managed to

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:08.930 
don't even know how they managed to
screw<00:04:07.560> up<00:04:07.650> that<00:04:07.709> everyone<00:04:08.190> for<00:04:08.370> headset<00:04:08.790> is

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
screw up that everyone for headset is

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.210 
screw up that everyone for headset is
now<00:04:09.450> pretty<00:04:09.959> much<00:04:10.110> useless<00:04:10.650> to<00:04:11.010> have<00:04:11.190> a

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
now pretty much useless to have a

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.100 
now pretty much useless to have a
headset<00:04:11.489> so<00:04:11.790> that<00:04:11.910> screwed<00:04:12.180> up<00:04:12.269> a<00:04:12.360> bit<00:04:12.540> but

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
headset so that screwed up a bit but

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:14.960 
headset so that screwed up a bit but
dead<00:04:13.320> sciences<00:04:13.769> or<00:04:13.890> help<00:04:14.070> occasionally<00:04:14.700> so

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
dead sciences or help occasionally so

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.699 
dead sciences or help occasionally so
now<00:04:15.510> that's<00:04:15.720> the<00:04:15.780> reason<00:04:16.019> I<00:04:16.140> used<00:04:16.410> dead

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
now that's the reason I used dead

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.130 
now that's the reason I used dead
silence<00:04:17.239> so<00:04:18.239> now<00:04:18.359> we're<00:04:18.510> moving<00:04:18.600> on<00:04:18.870> to<00:04:19.109> the

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
silence so now we're moving on to the

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:20.960 
silence so now we're moving on to the
levels<00:04:19.739> and<00:04:19.919> the<00:04:19.979> tap<00:04:20.400> schools<00:04:20.729> now<00:04:20.910> the

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
levels and the tap schools now the

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.360 
levels and the tap schools now the
lethal<00:04:21.479> I<00:04:21.570> was<00:04:21.690> using<00:04:21.930> was<00:04:22.440> a<00:04:22.500> claymore<00:04:23.130> which

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
lethal I was using was a claymore which

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:24.820 
lethal I was using was a claymore which
in<00:04:23.610> certain<00:04:23.820> destroy<00:04:24.300> is<00:04:24.510> completely

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
in certain destroy is completely

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.200 
in certain destroy is completely
priceless<00:04:25.830> it<00:04:25.979> really<00:04:26.280> is<00:04:26.400> it's<00:04:26.849> so

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
priceless it really is it's so

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.210 
priceless it really is it's so
useful<00:04:27.690> it<00:04:27.960> can<00:04:28.199> pretty<00:04:28.500> much<00:04:28.590> turn<00:04:28.889> the<00:04:29.009> whole

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
useful it can pretty much turn the whole
