00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.390
 hello and got it at one 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.919
 small tutorial or 6 on the quicktipp 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.000
 I know how long anyway 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.599
 will take 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.690
 i 've been so small the last few days 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:19.320
 I have a cutie quotes 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:23.580
 ritschel make and yes I have in 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.869
 Cabinet available and yes I would 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.640
 you now just a small 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.689
 Show trick as I have to malle 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.550
 here the eyebrows 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.100
 of course it is all a matter of taste 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:39.680
 Of course you can leave it that way now 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.680
 I mean now this this area 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.050
 I mean now he can be the 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.940
 you can also improve that way 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:56.039
 i have already improved it once i 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:59.070
 I think it's always better 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.260
 so I had improved him and me 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.940
 think it is simply here 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.900
 a little bit more and I'm just at the 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.659
 flood your bag it's like that too 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.090
 this simply in quotes 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.939
 the models have to be perfect 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.909
 or retouch it afterwards 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.920
 is not always as it seems and 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:23.070
 the one in it also shares such little fans 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.310
 she has beautiful eyebrows everyone 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.900
 so beautiful neat and in itself 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.210
 you do not need to do much but 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.100
 anyway I have it right here now 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.799
 and I thought well I'll show you 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.689
 like I did all this here 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:40.140
 just make a teaching level by her 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:44.430
 below I need clicks now 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.470
 simply renamed gray or brown 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.899
 it is my english and meier for me 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.560
 So do not be surprised then goes 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.990
 just from the brush that mandant one 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.170
 So the conclusion is that there are none 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:01.350
 hard the size but there like me 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:04.079
 always so very far down between 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.100
 I move two and three pixels 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.619
 depending on 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.690
 So she has big fat 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.110
 eyebrows and accordingly you can 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.510
 as well as three might go 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.360
 so what will it do in any case 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:21.200
 Opacity companies mostly work 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:25.340
 that's between ten and fifteen percent 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.810
 depending on how strong that may be we 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.150
 but then you can do it later 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.220
 accordingly in the blanket power here 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.990
 if the whole level just back 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.650
 you could now with 100 percent 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.080
 work 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.270
 However, I find here that you 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.880
 may also be wild so the hair 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.600
 go the direction of everyone 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.570
 Accordingly, yes one may 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.280
 bit wild times in things we so how 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.950
 practically paint a few hairs now 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:52.940
 We also make the color very easy 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:55.489
 to give here just the pipette the 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:58.250
 we get the pc with old easy and 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:04.070
 Just take the paint on here 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:05.959
 he's the one around here so the followers of 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:08.360
 So practically what we get out 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.520
 now somehow just press it 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.560
 and if we are practically simple now 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.600
 go up here 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.820
 So it was just me who got it 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.500
 It does not look like I do not know how to 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.850
 does not see it probably now but 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.709
 the beautiful is because we are with one 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:25.400
 low opacity work is called 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:27.709
 that we do not have so much so we have to 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.299
 not 100 percent more precise work that 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:32.239
 It is said we just have one 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:35.299
 little jan in the whole 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:36.950
 can prove here quiet times when na 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:39.410
 The chassis is perfectly perfect 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:42.560
 but just could have drawn 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.640
 We will not see you again 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.269
 we want now 100 percent 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:50.030
 would work and then later with the 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:52.100
 Opacity I think is in the end result 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.200
 not so great as we do 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.000
 We definitely take 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.430
 different colors that does not mean 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.560
 always the same because the hair structure 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:04.430
 Here is not always this is 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:07.220
 that means I have my husband so I want 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:11.930
 power has on this this place here 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:14.299
 you can see how the hair slowly as 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.310
 the slow forms and then make 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:20.530
 We continue to change our color 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.530
 bit brighter and that is really 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.180
 and it really was a long walk so 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:29.360
 who has in the tagblatt is natural 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:34.210
 absolutely in the advantage because you can completely 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:37.040
 much freedom to draw much freer 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:39.889
 which is now a mouse and work 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.240
 also it took off accordingly it is 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:44.360
 maybe not always so easy 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.970
 but you can definitely up 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.960
 that requires a bit of practice 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:51.080
 in between just when you're at 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:54.770
 photoshop would like to draw something with 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:56.960
 house but I think it's just fine 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:01.490
 We could be based on three percent 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:05.180
 go and I always say Slavic 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:08.180
 little and always new drivers 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.919
 record and where I am in the hair structure 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:13.100
 to go in that means I always do 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:16.160
 such a bow I always make my room 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:20.330
 back makes about 100 percent 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:22.130
 I'm always so bent and she 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.780
 also do not have 100 percent of the 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:26.630
 be his job or you do not have to 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:28.100
 to be as long as a rabbit 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:28.729
 that means you do not have to completely like that 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.220
 go 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:34.280
 you can also make small ones 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:37.940
 bit higher so I'll do it 100 times 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:39.080
 percent so you can see okay so runs the 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:41.360
 so 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:44.150
 and then you just take new color 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.419
 and do the same again here 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:49.340
 accordingly, you continue to work 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:49.789
 ok i do that in my workshop here 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:55.400
 below 

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:57.830
 make a small one then you could do that 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:00.289
 one can now here for example the 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:01.789
 Power is easy and then it is 

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:03.890
 It's okay , but I think so 

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:05.990
 here we were the eg 

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:09.410
 strokes too thick that would be at one 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:11.690
 small part me almost low 

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:12.080
 Covering power is not the same with the brush 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:14.210
 see 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:17.300
 Of course it is a matter of taste for everyone 

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:19.729
 makes like everyone else, of course, different 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:22.190
 some work at 100 percent 

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:25.010
 and well so how do we get here 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:28.030
 always before after we see 

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:28.030
 a little bit more 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:35.520
 the distances here join the 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:38.009
 are they here so I think so before 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.720
 after that and then not at the two 

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:42.360
 he is sinking but now that I am 

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:44.460
 painted on did not need to be afraid 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:47.639
 absolutely not if now goes further 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:49.229
 the picture now to coup from the far man 

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:52.169
 does not see it anymore and later with John 

00:06:49.229 --> 00:06:53.460
 Byrne you can still get this hair 

00:06:52.169 --> 00:06:56.310
 continue to work 

00:06:53.460 --> 00:07:00.659
 exactly the same technology I do when 

00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:01.729
 I once opened is then exactly 

00:07:00.659 --> 00:07:04.289
 the same thing 

00:07:01.729 --> 00:07:09.060
 then I work with little ones too 

00:07:04.289 --> 00:07:11.159
 move forward and paint me that there 

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:12.650
 and there you can join later 

00:07:11.159 --> 00:07:14.940
 germany is a bit of everything 

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:16.759
 customize how you speak what 

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:20.849
 like and what not 

00:07:16.759 --> 00:07:24.449
 and yes that's just a small tip 

00:07:20.849 --> 00:07:26.870
 so I draw have one for a 

00:07:24.449 --> 00:07:29.699
 or other interesting ones now 

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:32.129
 just now in youtube area 

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:33.990
 Of course , I'm always going to move 

00:07:32.129 --> 00:07:37.110
 happy if your commentary then let 

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:39.150
 like maybe the weiltal video too 

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:40.650
 shares or someone shows the exactly 

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:43.889
 I am currently booking myself, of course 

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:45.870
 happy as always otherwise wish you 

00:07:43.889 --> 00:07:47.990
 a nice week and you have to look up 

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:47.990
 on
