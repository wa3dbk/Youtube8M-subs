so let us start making it in a pan I am
going<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:30.869> add<00:00:30.990> in<00:00:31.170> my<00:00:31.199> milk

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809 
going to add in my milk

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:35.930 
going to add in my milk
Here<00:00:33.809> I<00:00:33.960> am<00:00:33.989> using<00:00:34.260> three<00:00:34.680> percent<00:00:35.160> toned<00:00:35.579> milk

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
Here I am using three percent toned milk

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.930 
Here I am using three percent toned milk
it's<00:00:36.840> preferable<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.559> use<00:00:37.770> toned<00:00:38.370> milk<00:00:38.640> rather

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
it's preferable to use toned milk rather

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.180 
it's preferable to use toned milk rather
than<00:00:39.090> full<00:00:39.300> cream<00:00:39.600> milk<00:00:39.629> I'm<00:00:40.200> also<00:00:40.829> going<00:00:41.100> to

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190

than full cream milk I'm also going to
add<00:00:41.430> in<00:00:41.460> my<00:00:41.730> sugar<00:00:41.790> to<00:00:42.180> this<00:00:43.129> and<00:00:44.360> now<00:00:45.360> you<00:00:45.420> need

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
add in my sugar to this and now you need

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.540 
add in my sugar to this and now you need
loads<00:00:46.020> of<00:00:46.200> patience<00:00:46.620> but<00:00:46.739> if<00:00:46.920> you<00:00:47.039> are<00:00:47.160> like<00:00:47.340> me

loads of patience but if you are like me
who<00:00:47.579> doesn't<00:00:47.879> have<00:00:48.090> patience<00:00:48.539> then<00:00:48.960> you<00:00:49.050> can

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
who doesn't have patience then you can

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.290 
who doesn't have patience then you can
heat<00:00:49.410> this<00:00:49.559> up<00:00:49.739> in<00:00:49.980> high<00:00:50.309> flame<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:50.700> cook<00:00:51.090> this

heat this up in high flame and cook this

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.330 
heat this up in high flame and cook this
but<00:00:51.870> it<00:00:52.020> is<00:00:52.110> preferable<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.770> cook<00:00:53.010> this<00:00:53.160> in

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
but it is preferable to cook this in

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.979 
but it is preferable to cook this in
medium<00:00:53.520> flame<00:00:56.180> now<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:57.239> just<00:00:57.449> have<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.690> stir

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
medium flame now you just have to stir

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.049 
medium flame now you just have to stir
this<00:00:58.260> regularly<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:58.980> cook<00:00:59.399> this<00:00:59.579> until<00:00:59.820> it

this regularly and cook this until it
thickens<00:01:00.239> up<00:01:00.539> that's<00:01:00.840> it<00:01:03.470> now<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.530> milk<00:01:04.860> has

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
thickens up that's it now the milk has

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.679 
thickens up that's it now the milk has
started<00:01:05.100> boiling<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:05.970> can<00:01:06.180> notice<00:01:06.540> a

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
started boiling and you can notice a

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.539 
started boiling and you can notice a
slight<00:01:07.020> change<00:01:07.380> in<00:01:07.590> color<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.159> milk<00:01:08.400> is

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
slight change in color the milk is

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.460 
slight change in color the milk is
turning<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:09.060> little<00:01:09.360> bit<00:01:09.540> yellow<00:01:09.750> that's<00:01:10.229> what

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
turning a little bit yellow that's what

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.310 
turning a little bit yellow that's what
we<00:01:10.619> want<00:01:11.299> so<00:01:12.299> I<00:01:12.360> am<00:01:12.420> going<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.689> just<00:01:12.869> turn<00:01:13.080> this

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
we want so I am going to just turn this

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.440 
we want so I am going to just turn this
in<00:01:13.470> cook<00:01:13.680> until<00:01:13.979> it<00:01:14.100> reduces<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:15.060> will<00:01:15.270> take

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
in cook until it reduces you will take

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.050 
in cook until it reduces you will take
about<00:01:15.570> 15<00:01:16.110> minutes<00:01:16.439> or<00:01:16.560> so<00:01:16.770> in<00:01:16.979> high<00:01:17.280> flame<00:01:20.060> if

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
about 15 minutes or so in high flame if

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.510 
about 15 minutes or so in high flame if
you<00:01:21.960> are<00:01:22.049> cooking<00:01:22.259> like<00:01:22.590> me<00:01:22.830> in<00:01:23.009> high<00:01:23.040> flame

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
you are cooking like me in high flame

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.820 
you are cooking like me in high flame
this<00:01:23.670> can<00:01:23.880> boil<00:01:24.119> over<00:01:24.420> anytime<00:01:24.689> not<00:01:25.409> only<00:01:25.710> in

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
this can boil over anytime not only in

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.530 
this can boil over anytime not only in
high<00:01:26.009> flame<00:01:26.250> but<00:01:26.430> in<00:01:26.549> medium<00:01:26.939> flame<00:01:27.119> as<00:01:27.330> well

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
high flame but in medium flame as well

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.170 
high flame but in medium flame as well
so<00:01:27.990> keep<00:01:28.170> an<00:01:28.350> eye<00:01:28.470> on<00:01:28.500> it<00:01:28.799> you<00:01:28.979> will<00:01:29.939> see<00:01:30.060> the

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
so keep an eye on it you will see the

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.050 
so keep an eye on it you will see the
milk<00:01:30.390> is<00:01:30.509> getting<00:01:30.630> thicker<00:01:31.140> now<00:01:31.850> you<00:01:32.850> might<00:01:33.030> be

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
milk is getting thicker now you might be

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.760 
milk is getting thicker now you might be
thinking<00:01:33.180> we<00:01:33.720> added<00:01:33.990> loads<00:01:34.200> of<00:01:34.409> sugar<00:01:34.439> in

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
thinking we added loads of sugar in

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.190 
thinking we added loads of sugar in
there<00:01:34.979> but<00:01:35.189> normally<00:01:35.640> 50%<00:01:36.329> sugar<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.750> 50%

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
there but normally 50% sugar and 50%

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.380 
there but normally 50% sugar and 50%
milk<00:01:37.650> is<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:37.950> ratio<00:01:38.280> for<00:01:38.460> condensed<00:01:38.820> milk<00:01:39.060> and

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
milk is the ratio for condensed milk and

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.690 
milk is the ratio for condensed milk and
also<00:01:40.259> why<00:01:40.590> didn't<00:01:40.860> we<00:01:40.979> add<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.250> sugar<00:01:41.280> at<00:01:41.670> the

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
also why didn't we add the sugar at the

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.580 
also why didn't we add the sugar at the
first<00:01:42.060> along<00:01:42.299> with<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.600> milk<00:01:42.840> because<00:01:43.409> we

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
first along with the milk because we

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.050 
first along with the milk because we
want<00:01:43.770> that<00:01:43.890> caramelized<00:01:44.520> flavor

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
want that caramelized flavor

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.389 
want that caramelized flavor
yellow<00:01:45.450> tinge<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:45.960> that<00:01:46.409> gooey<00:01:46.770> taste<00:01:47.159> and

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
yellow tinge and that gooey taste and

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.940 
yellow tinge and that gooey taste and
that's<00:01:47.820> how<00:01:48.060> we<00:01:48.119> will<00:01:48.299> get<00:01:48.420> it<00:01:51.530> this<00:01:52.530> milk<00:01:52.799> is

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
that's how we will get it this milk is

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.800 
that's how we will get it this milk is
boiling<00:01:53.159> over<00:01:53.549> like<00:01:53.820> this<00:01:54.030> from<00:01:54.270> past<00:01:54.570> couple

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
boiling over like this from past couple

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.539 
boiling over like this from past couple
of<00:01:55.020> minutes<00:01:55.380> let<00:01:55.590> me<00:01:55.740> lower<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.159> flame<00:01:56.340> and

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
of minutes let me lower the flame and
