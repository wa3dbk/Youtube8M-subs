00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 and shape the mission with your team 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:08.040
 look for your subtle or cunning good way since 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:11.370
 you know here lester gives the options for 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.900
 that michael chooses between bold or cunning and 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.179
 previous issues we have used we have 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.850
 chosen used now let's choose 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:20.160
 cunning or subtle good here the options 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.010
 to choose what the driver is to 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.279
 gunman and the hacker are the same 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.140
 that the daring have the same good 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.179
 the same slice or the same 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.899
 percentage of earnings 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:36.510
 here I am choosing the same edito 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:40.610
 attitude as you say has liked motta and 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:43.010
 also to the hacker that space gardens 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.170
 well then I'm choosing at the same 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:49.340
 team because they are the best and 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:51.860
 aside there is one that another one that there is 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:55.040
 certain qualities that help us in the 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:57.260
 flight well then apparently it's all 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.930
 ready true and he will call us to 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:03.110
 finalize the details well then here 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:05.630
 already given the mission completed in the mode 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.580
 subtle or even think that to get to 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.229
 gold you have to jump you all the 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.820
 cinematic and meet one another 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:16.100
 good requirement here in subtle mode 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.710
 same let's call franklin for 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:23.619
 tell him that there is a job the same 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.619
 happens that in the daring mode I look for 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.320
 two 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.320
 are 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.579
 I travel to study for seniors 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:46.860
 got confused 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.860
 about the level of influence of man 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.030
 already 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.060
 and then some additional details 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.090
 true and good one of the details 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:07.110
 additional is a team that asks us 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:09.510
 reading by text message tells us that 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.750
 there is a boxer van which 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:14.280
 we have to use and it's far away 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.030
 it's a little bit far away but it's easy to 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.850
 arrive but in the same way if not 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:24.960
 you position yourself very well in what is the 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:28.080
 saints you can use the good radar this 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:30.950
 mission is recontra easy but so that 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.930
 it's very easy, you have to use 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.660
 you have to be subtle at the moment 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.790
 to steal this this truck from the book 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.640
 songs 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.469
 if you do it in the daring way because 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.629
 here are also two ways to do it or 

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:47.760
 be to pass this mission to collect the 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:50.790
 boxer team can go front or 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.129
 you can go through the front door or 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.379
 you can go through the back door as much 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:56.400
 recommended is that you go through the door 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:58.500
 rear 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.670
 well here I am activating the map to 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.489
 that more or less locate if not 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:05.450
 I'm very used to it but it's straight if 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:08.209
 it's that front and a small curve 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.069
 but hey I told you that they have two 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:13.129
 ways of doing it if you do it by the 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:15.530
 way to go in front or by the 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:17.930
 main door you're going to call the 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.000
 police attention or the same 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.910
 types or the same workers of this 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.700
 company are going to put together and how are they going to 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.550
 alarm they will call the police if 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.490
 so 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:33.370
 you're going to have search striae and all 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:37.620
 that thing and it's going to complicate a bit 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:39.780
 the mission is going to be longer 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.989
 in this video we are going to do it with the 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:47.129
 quiet way or on the other hand 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:49.980
 back of this company to catch this 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:53.129
 vehicle that is very necessary for the 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:55.470
 subtle way that is going to give so 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:58.379
 subtle here so that they look for the 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.180
 subtle form of the assault on jewelry or 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:01.680
 work in good jewelry can be 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.650
 different as I say the input 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:07.829
 you can go back here 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.750
 around here is easy if it is much more 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:13.409
 easy good there is the door of 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:18.780
 entry to boxers so let's go out and 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:21.479
 I'm going to go into stealth mode yes to 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.940
 we will enter and you have to press the 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:28.590
 or for the lever l 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:30.930
 l then that way michael crouches 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:35.520
 so obviously you do not make a lot of noise 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:37.890
 and here you go a blow on the neck so that 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.630
 is locked the type not with 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:42.720
 circle 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:45.270
 alright then we have not called a 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:48.050
 bad attention as you realize everything 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.050
 it's quiet 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:55.280
 and now let's go to what is the 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:57.770
 textile factory or textile factory you give 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:00.530
 mind that it is very easy is not this 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:03.470
 way is very easy and in addition to doing it 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:06.550
 easy and without you being the cop you're going to 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:09.770
 be able to get a 100% medal 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:12.250
 then the stealth mode is necessary what 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:14.660
 you learned in what the mission is 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:16.400
 Marriage counseling remember there 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.740
 for the first time they taught us to be 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.870
 stealthy and they also taught us to 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.250
 knock people out the reds the 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.020
 rope when we had that does not want to at 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:27.500
 good gardener then we were 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:30.620
 using the same method and it's better because 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:33.020
 sometimes the police are re-fucked in gta 5 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.490
 You know how the cops here though 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.600
 good can be beat them of some 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:40.060
 way easily but 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.250
 at the time of the persecution it is horrible 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:46.090
 I do not particularly like it is worse than 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:48.520
 gta 4 well I think it's 4 that the 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:50.110
 difference is that in gta 4 they saw you 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.240
 wherever you are, you could go through the 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.250
 walls and all that truth 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.590
 instead the gta 5 x 7 hidden below 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:59.110
 a bridge or on a highway that is me 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:01.840
 locked up the cops are not going to see you 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:04.510
 the structures will go through the eyes 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:06.820
 they will not go through the cement then 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:09.130
 it's going to be relatively relatively more 

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:12.400
 simple relatively simple but 

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:16.849
 likewise is re fucking police 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:20.449
 here in gta 5 good then 

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:23.959
 and that way we get rid of this 

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:26.499
 We no longer have problems with 

00:06:23.959 --> 00:06:29.419
 the cop just left the truck 

00:06:26.499 --> 00:06:32.149
 in the textile factory and business 

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:35.029
 solved well we are already a little 

00:06:32.149 --> 00:06:37.729
 less than one kilometer less than half 

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:40.969
 kilometer and we are arriving and so 

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:45.349
 easily we passed this mini mission of the 

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:47.809
 team of boxers in subtle or cunning way 

00:06:45.349 --> 00:06:50.719
 well we are here 

00:06:47.809 --> 00:06:53.259
 now we have to leave the truck in 

00:06:50.719 --> 00:06:56.400
 the yellow marker and that way 

00:06:53.259 --> 00:06:59.460
 mission exceeded 

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:02.460
 this and as I tell you 100% the requirement 

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:06.410
 plate is that laugh be stealthy at the moment 

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:06.410
 to steal this truck 

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:11.420
 well there's a call the state we're 

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.420
 calling in this 

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:26.639
 one 

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:29.900
 good if you want injured expert to like 

00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:29.900
 do not feel france
