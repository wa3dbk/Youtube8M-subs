the neck Deana likes to look up with

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.190 
the neck Deana likes to look up with
this<00:01:35.670> one<00:01:35.850> we<00:01:36.299> don't<00:01:36.450> really<00:01:36.570> have<00:01:36.869> any<00:01:37.020> good

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
this one we don't really have any good

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.749 
this one we don't really have any good
evidence<00:01:37.259> to<00:01:37.829> say<00:01:38.009> that<00:01:38.039> you<00:01:38.280> have<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.609> keep

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
evidence to say that you have to keep

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.760 
evidence to say that you have to keep
your<00:01:38.939> neck<00:01:39.180> in<00:01:39.210> one<00:01:39.600> specific<00:01:39.869> position<00:01:40.590> or

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
your neck in one specific position or

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.499 
your neck in one specific position or
the<00:01:40.890> other<00:01:40.920> so<00:01:41.520> I'm<00:01:41.640> not<00:01:41.789> going<00:01:41.969> to<00:01:42.030> get<00:01:42.180> caught

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
the other so I'm not going to get caught

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.170 
the other so I'm not going to get caught
up<00:01:42.539> with<00:01:42.930> that<00:01:42.990> kind<00:01:43.259> of<00:01:43.380> stuff<00:01:43.590> if<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.969> are

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
up with that kind of stuff if you are

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.999 
up with that kind of stuff if you are
fine<00:01:45.780> just<00:01:46.289> understand<00:01:46.590> you<00:01:46.649> don't<00:01:46.799> have<00:01:46.890> good

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
fine just understand you don't have good

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.910 
fine just understand you don't have good
evidence<00:01:47.189> to<00:01:47.520> support<00:01:47.700> that<00:01:48.170> so<00:01:49.170> that's<00:01:49.710> the

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
evidence to support that so that's the

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.550 
evidence to support that so that's the
cue<00:01:50.130> we<00:01:50.460> go<00:01:50.640> for<00:01:50.909> but<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.509> idea<00:01:51.869> is<00:01:52.020> not<00:01:52.200> just

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
cue we go for but the idea is not just

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.039 
cue we go for but the idea is not just
to<00:01:52.829> say<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.369> generalized<00:01:54.060> F<00:01:54.450> do<00:01:54.659> you<00:01:54.719> know<00:01:54.810> them

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
to say a generalized F do you know them

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.899 
to say a generalized F do you know them
certainly<00:01:55.710> not<00:01:55.920> just<00:01:55.950> because<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.700> weights

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
certainly not just because the weights

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.700 
certainly not just because the weights
hit<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.240> ground<00:01:57.479> if<00:01:57.689> using<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.049> barbell<00:01:58.259> or<00:01:58.590> the

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
hit the ground if using a barbell or the

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:59.990 
hit the ground if using a barbell or the
especially<00:01:59.189> if<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.340> dumbbells<00:01:59.700> hit<00:01:59.850> the

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
especially if the dumbbells hit the

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.720 
especially if the dumbbells hit the
Brown<00:02:00.180> or<00:02:00.690> just<00:02:01.320> to<00:02:01.410> say<00:02:01.590> just<00:02:01.920> say<00:02:02.130> mid-shin

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:02.730 
Brown or just to say just say mid-shin

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.000 
Brown or just to say just say mid-shin
or<00:02:02.970> whatever<00:02:03.270> it's<00:02:03.930> basically<00:02:04.320> how<00:02:04.560> low<00:02:04.830> they

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010 
or whatever it's basically how low they

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.940 
or whatever it's basically how low they
can<00:02:05.190> go<00:02:05.400> in<00:02:05.670> good<00:02:06.180> control<00:02:06.660> and<00:02:07.200> that's<00:02:07.560> one

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
can go in good control and that's one

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.219 
can go in good control and that's one
way<00:02:08.130> we<00:02:08.399> tell<00:02:08.820> if<00:02:09.090> we're<00:02:09.509> maintaining<00:02:10.110> that

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
way we tell if we're maintaining that

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.220 
way we tell if we're maintaining that
lumbar<00:02:10.470> control<00:02:11.370> lastly<00:02:12.060> I'm<00:02:12.660> not<00:02:12.900> a<00:02:12.930> fan

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
lumbar control lastly I'm not a fan

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.930 
lumbar control lastly I'm not a fan
notice<00:02:13.650> we<00:02:13.770> did<00:02:13.950> Romanian<00:02:14.400> deadlifts<00:02:14.790> here

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
notice we did Romanian deadlifts here

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.360 
notice we did Romanian deadlifts here
I'm<00:02:15.120> not<00:02:15.330> a<00:02:15.360> big<00:02:15.570> fan<00:02:15.810> of<00:02:15.840> doing<00:02:16.110> stiff<00:02:17.070> legged

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
I'm not a big fan of doing stiff legged

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.370 
I'm not a big fan of doing stiff legged
deadlifts<00:02:17.940> now<00:02:18.060> some<00:02:18.270> people<00:02:18.390> think<00:02:19.110> there's

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
deadlifts now some people think there's

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.590 
deadlifts now some people think there's
two<00:02:19.560> interchangeable<00:02:19.830> I<00:02:20.580> just<00:02:21.180> not<00:02:21.330> a<00:02:21.360> fan<00:02:21.570> of

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
two interchangeable I just not a fan of

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.530 
two interchangeable I just not a fan of
the<00:02:21.810> name<00:02:22.050> why<00:02:22.320> because<00:02:22.709> stiff<00:02:22.950> legged<00:02:23.540> if

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
the name why because stiff legged if

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.750 
the name why because stiff legged if
you're<00:02:24.750> not<00:02:24.900> really<00:02:25.050> sure<00:02:25.140> means<00:02:25.890> like<00:02:26.190> stiff

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
you're not really sure means like stiff

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.580 
you're not really sure means like stiff
leg<00:02:27.000> straight<00:02:27.420> leg<00:02:27.630> and<00:02:27.870> if<00:02:28.320> you<00:02:28.440> have<00:02:28.560> a

doing this
it<00:02:31.290> immediately<00:02:31.590> forces<00:02:32.310> you<00:02:32.430> to<00:02:32.459> round<00:02:32.730> out

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910
