here's a here's an example this is one

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.170 
here's a here's an example this is one
of<00:03:18.910> the<00:03:19.060> back<00:03:19.709> for<00:03:20.709> the<00:03:20.769> engines<00:03:21.190> and<00:03:21.549> here's

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
of the back for the engines and here's

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.030 
of the back for the engines and here's
one<00:03:22.420> that's<00:03:22.600> you<00:03:23.080> know<00:03:23.200> it's<00:03:23.350> really<00:03:23.739> in<00:03:23.830> bad

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
shape

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.950 
shape
here's<00:03:26.920> how

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:29.960 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.070 

here<00:03:30.710> was<00:03:30.860> the<00:03:30.980> end<00:03:31.100> result<00:03:31.460> I<00:03:31.850> think<00:03:32.570> it<00:03:32.900> came

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
here was the end result I think it came

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:40.030 
here was the end result I think it came
out<00:03:33.140> quite<00:03:33.470> nice<00:03:35.770> here's<00:03:36.770> another<00:03:37.100> example<00:03:39.040> as

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
out quite nice here's another example as

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
out quite nice here's another example as
far<00:03:40.340> as<00:03:41.200> this<00:03:42.200> one<00:03:42.260> right<00:03:42.530> here<00:03:42.800> goes<00:03:43.010> you<00:03:43.970> know

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
far as this one right here goes you know

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:45.640 
far as this one right here goes you know
they<00:03:44.210> were<00:03:44.270> just<00:03:44.360> a<00:03:44.780> little<00:03:44.810> bit<00:03:45.230> different

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
they were just a little bit different

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.050 
they were just a little bit different
color<00:03:45.770> I<00:03:45.950> guess<00:03:46.250> that<00:03:46.460> I<00:03:46.550> could<00:03:46.760> have<00:03:46.850> messed

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
color I guess that I could have messed

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.350 
color I guess that I could have messed
around<00:03:47.210> with<00:03:47.510> the<00:03:47.660> editing<00:03:48.350> part<00:03:48.590> on<00:03:48.860> my

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
around with the editing part on my

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.750 
around with the editing part on my
document<00:03:50.360> to<00:03:51.290> change<00:03:51.590> the<00:03:51.770> color<00:03:52.010> and<00:03:52.400> get<00:03:52.670> it

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
document to change the color and get it

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.600 
document to change the color and get it
back<00:03:52.940> to<00:03:53.180> where<00:03:53.360> it<00:03:53.390> looked<00:03:53.600> like<00:03:53.750> this<00:03:53.960> but

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610

this<00:04:12.710> part<00:04:12.980> of<00:04:13.190> it<00:04:17.710> I'm<00:04:18.710> here<00:04:18.980> to<00:04:19.040> tell<00:04:19.250> you

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
this part of it I'm here to tell you

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.330 
this part of it I'm here to tell you
right<00:04:19.460> now<00:04:19.520> that's<00:04:20.210> what<00:04:20.450> took<00:04:21.350> the<00:04:21.530> longest<00:04:21.560> I

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
right now that's what took the longest I

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.190 
right now that's what took the longest I
fiddled<00:04:23.240> around<00:04:23.300> with<00:04:23.540> that<00:04:23.690> little<00:04:23.750> motor

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
fiddled around with that little motor

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.320 
fiddled around with that little motor
for<00:04:24.530> the<00:04:24.650> longest<00:04:25.130> time<00:04:25.340> and<00:04:25.670> I'm<00:04:26.120> here<00:04:26.270> to

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
for the longest time and I'm here to

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.260 
for the longest time and I'm here to
tell<00:04:26.480> you<00:04:26.600> it<00:04:26.900> was<00:04:27.080> it<00:04:27.380> was<00:04:27.530> a<00:04:27.560> pain<00:04:27.830> in<00:04:27.860> ass<00:04:28.270> but

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
tell you it was it was a pain in ass but

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.170 
tell you it was it was a pain in ass but
I've<00:04:29.390> got<00:04:29.600> mine<00:04:29.840> to<00:04:29.990> working<00:04:30.410> it<00:04:31.340> was<00:04:31.460> a<00:04:31.550> kind

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
I've got mine to working it was a kind

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.700 
I've got mine to working it was a kind
of<00:04:32.270> a<00:04:33.220> quick<00:04:34.540> design<00:04:35.540> that<00:04:35.930> Kenner<00:04:36.230> came<00:04:36.500> up

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
of a quick design that Kenner came up

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.030 
of a quick design that Kenner came up
with<00:04:36.920> for<00:04:37.220> this<00:04:37.370> part<00:04:37.790> to<00:04:38.120> actually<00:04:38.630> work<00:04:39.040> for

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.040 
with for this part to actually work for

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.560 
with for this part to actually work for
the<00:04:40.100> little<00:04:40.340> motor<00:04:40.520> that<00:04:40.820> slips<00:04:41.120> on<00:04:41.300> the<00:04:41.390> piece

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
the little motor that slips on the piece

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.230 
the little motor that slips on the piece
of<00:04:41.600> plastic<00:04:42.140> to<00:04:42.260> make<00:04:42.410> some<00:04:42.590> noise<00:04:42.710> but<00:04:43.240> it's

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
of plastic to make some noise but it's

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.030 
of plastic to make some noise but it's
kind<00:04:44.420> of<00:04:44.480> a<00:04:44.570> bad<00:04:44.780> design<00:04:45.200> if<00:04:45.410> you<00:04:45.440> actually<00:04:45.710> sit

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.040 
kind of a bad design if you actually sit

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.610 
kind of a bad design if you actually sit
down<00:04:46.250> and<00:04:46.340> look<00:04:46.460> at<00:04:46.640> it<00:04:46.790> and<00:04:47.110> like<00:04:48.110> I<00:04:48.170> said<00:04:48.380> mine

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
down and look at it and like I said mine

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.370 
down and look at it and like I said mine
was<00:04:48.650> painting<00:04:49.100> ass<00:04:49.250> I<00:04:49.610> actually<00:04:50.330> had<00:04:51.110> to<00:04:51.200> take

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
was painting ass I actually had to take

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.440 
was painting ass I actually had to take
the<00:04:51.530> little<00:04:51.710> motor<00:04:51.890> apart<00:04:52.280> because<00:04:52.820> I<00:04:53.000> figured

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:53.450 
the little motor apart because I figured

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:54.760 
the little motor apart because I figured
out<00:04:53.570> that<00:04:53.780> mine<00:04:54.020> weren't<00:04:54.230> working<00:04:54.620> because

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770 
out that mine weren't working because

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.730 
out that mine weren't working because
the<00:04:55.160> receptors<00:04:55.880> had<00:04:56.870> came<00:04:57.110> loose<00:04:57.350> from<00:04:57.620> the

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
the receptors had came loose from the

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.000 
the receptors had came loose from the
inside<00:04:58.250> of<00:04:58.280> the<00:04:58.460> motor<00:04:58.670> and<00:04:59.770> they<00:05:00.770> really

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.010 
inside of the motor and they really

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:02.650 
inside of the motor and they really
didn't<00:05:01.280> video<00:05:01.550> that<00:05:01.820> but<00:05:02.030> here<00:05:02.210> you<00:05:02.300> can<00:05:02.480> take

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660 
didn't video that but here you can take

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.080 
didn't video that but here you can take
a<00:05:02.690> look<00:05:02.900> at<00:05:03.170> you<00:05:03.800> know<00:05:03.890> the<00:05:03.920> inside<00:05:04.460> what<00:05:04.970> the

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
a look at you know the inside what the

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:27.130 
a look at you know the inside what the
motor<00:05:05.270> actually<00:05:05.660> looks<00:05:05.870> like

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:27.140 

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:30.170 

now<00:05:28.140> after<00:05:28.860> I<00:05:29.070> got<00:05:29.220> the<00:05:29.370> motor<00:05:29.520> to<00:05:29.700> working<00:05:30.060> and

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
now after I got the motor to working and

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.750 
now after I got the motor to working and
I<00:05:30.270> had<00:05:30.480> to<00:05:30.630> you<00:05:31.590> know<00:05:31.710> the<00:05:31.920> Falcon<00:05:32.310> apart<00:05:32.610> I

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:32.760 
I had to you know the Falcon apart I

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:33.950 
I had to you know the Falcon apart I
thought<00:05:33.000> that<00:05:33.210> I<00:05:33.300> would<00:05:33.450> give<00:05:33.570> it<00:05:33.690> an<00:05:33.780> upgrade

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 
thought that I would give it an upgrade

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.070 
thought that I would give it an upgrade
and<00:05:34.890> what<00:05:35.010> I<00:05:35.040> mean<00:05:35.220> by<00:05:35.280> an<00:05:35.550> upgrade<00:05:36.030> as<00:05:36.240> a<00:05:36.360> kid<00:05:36.780> I

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
and what I mean by an upgrade as a kid I

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.460 
and what I mean by an upgrade as a kid I
always<00:05:37.410> wanted<00:05:38.160> lights<00:05:38.700> on<00:05:39.120> mine<00:05:39.440> you<00:05:40.440> know

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:40.470 
always wanted lights on mine you know

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:41.930 
always wanted lights on mine you know
not<00:05:40.680> a<00:05:40.710> whole<00:05:40.800> lot<00:05:41.220> but<00:05:41.370> you<00:05:41.550> know<00:05:41.580> just<00:05:41.790> a

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 
not a whole lot but you know just a

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.080 
not a whole lot but you know just a
couple<00:05:42.180> of<00:05:42.330> lights<00:05:42.540> so<00:05:42.900> I<00:05:43.340> found<00:05:44.340> a<00:05:44.550> couple<00:05:44.580> of

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 
couple of lights so I found a couple of

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:49.550 
couple of lights so I found a couple of
super<00:05:45.570> bright<00:05:45.800> miniature<00:05:46.800> LEDs<00:05:47.340> and<00:05:48.560> install

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 
super bright miniature LEDs and install

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.940 
super bright miniature LEDs and install
them<00:05:49.800> it's<00:05:50.430> a<00:05:50.720> not<00:05:51.720> a<00:05:51.750> very<00:05:51.840> hard<00:05:52.320> process<00:05:52.560> to

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:52.950 
them it's a not a very hard process to

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:55.490 
them it's a not a very hard process to
do<00:05:53.070> this<00:05:53.280> and<00:05:53.630> but<00:05:54.630> here<00:05:54.840> you<00:05:54.930> can<00:05:55.080> take<00:05:55.230> a<00:05:55.290> look

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:55.500 
do this and but here you can take a look

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:13.570 
do this and but here you can take a look
at<00:05:55.790> how<00:05:56.790> rendering<00:05:57.450> for<00:05:57.780> mine

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:13.580 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:17.890 

okay<00:06:14.180> once<00:06:14.420> I<00:06:14.570> got<00:06:14.720> to<00:06:14.840> the<00:06:14.930> back<00:06:16.420> as<00:06:17.420> far<00:06:17.780> as

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:17.900 
okay once I got to the back as far as

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:19.450 
okay once I got to the back as far as
just<00:06:18.080> how<00:06:18.230> I<00:06:18.260> wanted<00:06:18.590> to<00:06:18.710> have<00:06:18.830> mine<00:06:19.070> hooked<00:06:19.310> up

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:19.460 
just how I wanted to have mine hooked up

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:23.290 
just how I wanted to have mine hooked up
for<00:06:19.490> the<00:06:19.670> lights<00:06:19.880> I<00:06:20.210> decided<00:06:21.200> to<00:06:22.120> just<00:06:23.120> leave

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:23.300 
for the lights I decided to just leave

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.450 
for the lights I decided to just leave
them<00:06:23.480> hooked<00:06:23.750> with<00:06:23.990> the<00:06:24.230> with<00:06:24.920> a<00:06:24.950> 9-volt

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:25.460 
them hooked with the with a 9-volt

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:30.010 
them hooked with the with a 9-volt
battery<00:06:26.800> no<00:06:27.800> switch<00:06:28.330> you<00:06:29.330> know<00:06:29.450> no<00:06:29.690> anything

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:30.020 
battery no switch you know no anything

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:34.110 
battery no switch you know no anything
is<00:06:30.380> just<00:06:31.480> it's<00:06:32.480> just<00:06:32.690> you<00:06:32.810> hooking<00:06:33.020> a<00:06:33.230> 9-volt

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:34.120 
is just it's just you hooking a 9-volt

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:38.130 
is just it's just you hooking a 9-volt
up<00:06:35.120> to<00:06:35.360> the<00:06:35.510> to<00:06:35.990> the<00:06:36.080> other<00:06:36.170> end<00:06:36.500> of<00:06:36.650> it<00:06:36.800> and

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:38.140 
up to the to the other end of it and

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:40.330 
up to the to the other end of it and
sliding<00:06:39.140> the<00:06:39.290> battery<00:06:39.560> back<00:06:39.800> down<00:06:40.010> and<00:06:40.250> you

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:40.340 
sliding the battery back down and you

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:43.950 
sliding the battery back down and you
know<00:06:40.460> that's<00:06:40.670> it

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:43.960 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:47.980 

and<00:06:44.960> there's<00:06:45.170> how<00:06:45.380> mine<00:06:46.510> there's<00:06:47.510> how<00:06:47.720> it<00:06:47.840> keep

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:47.990 
and there's how mine there's how it keep

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:50.690 
mine old now here's the end result

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:54.100 
mine old now here's the end result
here's<00:06:51.230> what<00:06:52.240> it's<00:06:53.240> what<00:06:53.390> it<00:06:53.480> looks<00:06:53.660> like<00:06:53.840> and
