this game I'm going to be executing that

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.250 
this game I'm going to be executing that
exact<00:00:51.270> builder<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:51.690> as<00:00:51.750> you<00:00:51.840> can<00:00:51.960> see<00:00:51.989> already

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
exact builder and as you can see already

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.010 
exact builder and as you can see already
the<00:00:52.469> hatch<00:00:52.770> Deepu<00:00:53.610> anti-gas<00:00:54.270> guys<00:00:54.539> are<00:00:54.750> going

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
the hatch Deepu anti-gas guys are going

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.720 
the hatch Deepu anti-gas guys are going
down<00:00:55.170> I<00:00:55.289> skip<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.649> first<00:00:55.860> two<00:00:56.160> or<00:00:56.309> so<00:00:56.489> minutes

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
down I skip the first two or so minutes

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.670 
down I skip the first two or so minutes
of<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.000> game<00:00:57.030> cuz<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:57.780> know<00:00:57.870> nothing<00:00:58.410> really

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
of the game cuz you know nothing really

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.310 
of the game cuz you know nothing really
happens<00:00:59.039> at<00:00:59.190> that<00:00:59.340> point<00:00:59.609> in<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.789> game<00:00:59.820> so

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
happens at that point in the game so

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.619 
happens at that point in the game so
yeah<00:01:01.320> so<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:02.010> reason<00:01:02.219> why<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.730> build<00:01:03.059> or<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:03.300> so

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
yeah so the reason why the build or a so

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.390 
yeah so the reason why the build or a so
strong<00:01:03.899> I<00:01:03.989> go<00:01:04.260> for<00:01:04.409> it<00:01:04.500> is<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.619> little<00:01:05.010> bit<00:01:05.220> in

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
strong I go for it is a little bit in

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.370 
strong I go for it is a little bit in
the<00:01:05.489> video<00:01:05.760> itself<00:01:06.119> but<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.689> reason<00:01:06.960> why<00:01:07.320> it

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
the video itself but the reason why it

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.170 
the video itself but the reason why it
is<00:01:07.619> so<00:01:07.830> strong<00:01:08.130> currently<00:01:08.610> it's<00:01:08.790> because<00:01:09.060> a

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
is so strong currently it's because a

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.060 
is so strong currently it's because a
lot<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:09.510> time<00:01:09.840> players<00:01:10.170> are<00:01:10.439> playing

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
lot of time players are playing

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.850 
lot of time players are playing
absolutely<00:01:11.909> super<00:01:12.450> super<00:01:12.689> greedy<00:01:12.960> like<00:01:13.590> most

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
absolutely super super greedy like most

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.830 
absolutely super super greedy like most
of<00:01:13.979> them<00:01:14.130> are<00:01:14.280> just<00:01:14.310> being<00:01:14.729> like<00:01:14.939> ok<00:01:15.119> I'm<00:01:15.509> I'm

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
of them are just being like ok I'm I'm

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.020 
of them are just being like ok I'm I'm
again<00:01:16.170> cabanne<00:01:16.770> sounder<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.250> I<00:01:17.520> get<00:01:17.759> another

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
again cabanne sounder and I get another

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.969 
again cabanne sounder and I get another
command<00:01:18.390> sounder<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:19.200> that<00:01:19.380> other

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
command sounder and so that other

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.340 
command sounder and so that other
command<00:01:20.400> center<00:01:20.759> so<00:01:21.180> they<00:01:21.210> are<00:01:21.600> most<00:01:22.049> of<00:01:22.170> the

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
command center so they are most of the

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.350 
command center so they are most of the
time<00:01:22.530> they<00:01:22.710> are<00:01:22.799> going<00:01:22.979> for<00:01:23.340> at<00:01:23.610> least<00:01:24.090> like<00:01:24.240> a

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
time they are going for at least like a

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.999 
time they are going for at least like a
very<00:01:24.689> quick<00:01:24.930> natural<00:01:25.380> but<00:01:25.530> most<00:01:25.710> of<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:25.920> time

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
very quick natural but most of the time

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.520 
very quick natural but most of the time

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.309 
to follow it up with more and more units
now<00:05:49.729> I'm<00:05:49.940> going<00:05:50.210> to<00:05:50.330> go<00:05:50.449> back<00:05:50.479> into<00:05:50.900> drowning

00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:51.319 
now I'm going to go back into drowning

00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:53.230 
now I'm going to go back into drowning
in<00:05:51.440> a<00:05:51.529> little<00:05:51.800> tiny<00:05:51.949> bit<00:05:52.069> as<00:05:52.339> well<00:05:52.550> but

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.240 
in a little tiny bit as well but

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.329 
in a little tiny bit as well but
initially<00:05:53.960> at<00:05:54.080> this<00:05:54.229> point<00:05:54.500> the<00:05:54.889> game<00:05:55.099> is

00:05:55.329 --> 00:05:55.339 
initially at this point the game is

00:05:55.339 --> 00:05:57.490 
initially at this point the game is
pretty<00:05:55.759> much<00:05:55.969> over<00:05:56.240> i<00:05:56.449> am<00:05:56.719> just<00:05:57.020> making<00:05:57.169> more

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:57.500 
pretty much over i am just making more

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.980 
pretty much over i am just making more
stuff<00:05:57.710> because<00:05:57.949> I<00:05:57.979> recognize<00:05:58.520> it<00:05:58.759> out<00:05:59.150> I<00:05:59.449> will

00:05:59.980 --> 00:05:59.990 
stuff because I recognize it out I will

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:01.809 
stuff because I recognize it out I will
probably<00:06:00.439> be<00:06:00.560> able<00:06:00.770> to<00:06:00.860> bring<00:06:00.979> right<00:06:01.219> here<00:06:01.400> but

00:06:01.809 --> 00:06:01.819 
probably be able to bring right here but

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:03.399 
probably be able to bring right here but
ideally<00:06:02.270> you<00:06:02.389> would<00:06:02.569> want<00:06:02.810> to<00:06:02.900> transition<00:06:03.139> out

00:06:03.399 --> 00:06:03.409 
ideally you would want to transition out

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:05.110 
ideally you would want to transition out
of<00:06:03.439> this<00:06:03.680> and<00:06:03.919> go<00:06:04.189> to<00:06:04.250> the<00:06:04.520> mid<00:06:04.699> game<00:06:04.849> with<00:06:05.089> a

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 
of this and go to the mid game with a

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.760 
of this and go to the mid game with a
gigantic<00:06:05.719> advantage<00:06:06.319> I<00:06:06.379> want<00:06:06.500> to<00:06:06.560> thank<00:06:06.710> you

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:06.770 
gigantic advantage I want to thank you

game<00:06:11.839> by<00:06:12.439> timing<00:06:13.159> cruise<00:06:13.400> right<00:06:13.639> out<00:06:13.699> about<00:06:14.029> a

00:06:14.079 --> 00:06:14.089 
game by timing cruise right out about a

00:06:14.089 --> 00:06:15.879 
game by timing cruise right out about a
lot<00:06:14.360> of<00:06:14.509> high-level<00:06:14.689> players<00:06:15.080> are<00:06:15.379> executing

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:15.889 
lot of high-level players are executing

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:17.709 
lot of high-level players are executing
but<00:06:16.339> today<00:06:16.610> we're<00:06:16.819> gonna<00:06:17.000> go<00:06:17.180> not<00:06:17.389> over<00:06:17.689> a

00:06:17.709 --> 00:06:17.719 
but today we're gonna go not over a

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:19.209 
but today we're gonna go not over a
three<00:06:17.990> base<00:06:18.169> high<00:06:18.409> boots<00:06:18.770> what<00:06:18.919> we're<00:06:19.039> gonna

00:06:19.209 --> 00:06:19.219 
three base high boots what we're gonna

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:21.249 
three base high boots what we're gonna
go<00:06:19.400> over<00:06:19.430> a<00:06:19.669> two<00:06:19.939> base<00:06:20.120> line<00:06:20.419> equation<00:06:20.839> now

00:06:21.249 --> 00:06:21.259 
go over a two base line equation now

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:24.789 
go over a two base line equation now
this<00:06:21.469> is<00:06:21.620> one<00:06:21.830> of<00:06:21.949> the<00:06:22.069> billboard<00:06:22.550> of<00:06:22.669> this
