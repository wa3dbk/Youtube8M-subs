00:01:19.919 --> 00:01:19.929 
about the wire guided feature is that

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:21.569 
about the wire guided feature is that
even<00:01:20.139> if<00:01:20.289> the<00:01:20.319> rocket<00:01:20.679> is<00:01:20.770> flying<00:01:20.920> off<00:01:21.219> for<00:01:21.460> two

then they know you're there depending on
where<00:01:39.850> you<00:01:39.939> hit<00:01:40.119> them<00:01:40.209> and<00:01:40.389> what<00:01:40.509> you're<00:01:40.630> using

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
where you hit them and what you're using

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.660 
where you hit them and what you're using
it<00:01:41.109> could<00:01:41.200> take<00:01:41.380> three<00:01:41.649> or<00:01:41.829> more<00:01:41.979> shots<00:01:42.279> to<00:01:42.490> sin

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
it could take three or more shots to sin

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.389 
it could take three or more shots to sin

can then quickly reload and fire another

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.120 
can then quickly reload and fire another
one<00:01:51.789> directly<00:01:52.270> at<00:01:52.420> your<00:01:52.539> target<00:01:52.719> the<00:01:53.649> second

one directly at your target the second
rocket<00:01:54.340> is<00:01:54.609> obviously<00:01:54.969> flying<00:01:55.299> straight<00:01:55.569> at

rocket is obviously flying straight at
the<00:01:55.840> enemy<00:01:56.139> but<00:01:56.590> what<00:01:56.709> you<00:01:56.740> don't<00:01:57.009> see<00:01:57.279> is<00:01:57.520> that

00:01:57.779 --> 00:01:57.789 
the enemy but what you don't see is that

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:59.940 
the enemy but what you don't see is that
the<00:01:57.939> first<00:01:58.299> rocket<00:01:58.899> has<00:01:59.109> heard<00:01:59.349> the<00:01:59.499> call<00:01:59.709> of

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
the first rocket has heard the call of

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.609 
the first rocket has heard the call of
the<00:01:59.999> precious<00:02:00.999> and<00:02:01.359> it's<00:02:01.990> headed<00:02:02.229> back<00:02:02.409> in

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
the precious and it's headed back in

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:05.099 
the precious and it's headed back in
just<00:02:02.889> as<00:02:03.009> fast<00:02:03.340> as<00:02:03.520> it<00:02:03.670> can<00:02:03.789> go<00:02:03.969> what<00:02:04.899> you<00:02:04.990> end

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:05.109 
just as fast as it can go what you end

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:06.989 
just as fast as it can go what you end
up<00:02:05.200> with<00:02:05.259> is<00:02:05.439> two<00:02:05.889> rockets<00:02:06.399> hitting<00:02:06.700> the<00:02:06.789> enemy

00:02:06.989 --> 00:02:06.999 
up with is two rockets hitting the enemy

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:08.999 
up with is two rockets hitting the enemy
vehicle<00:02:07.389> together<00:02:07.689> and<00:02:07.959> dropping<00:02:08.679> its<00:02:08.800> health

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
vehicle together and dropping its health

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.610 
vehicle together and dropping its health
much<00:02:09.369> faster<00:02:09.910> than<00:02:10.060> normal<00:02:10.240> on<00:02:10.599> top<00:02:11.380> of<00:02:11.530> this

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
much faster than normal on top of this

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.350 
much faster than normal on top of this
the<00:02:11.830> first<00:02:11.860> Locker<00:02:12.280> you<00:02:12.370> fired<00:02:12.700> we<00:02:12.910> usually

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
the first Locker you fired we usually

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.910 
the first Locker you fired we usually
hit<00:02:13.450> the<00:02:13.599> top<00:02:13.840> of<00:02:14.050> the<00:02:14.110> enemy<00:02:14.319> vehicle<00:02:14.709> so<00:02:14.890> it

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
hit the top of the enemy vehicle so it

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.430 
hit the top of the enemy vehicle so it
will<00:02:15.099> deal<00:02:15.280> extra<00:02:15.760> damage<00:02:16.020> you'll<00:02:17.020> see<00:02:17.230> one

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
will deal extra damage you'll see one

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.350 
will deal extra damage you'll see one
rocket<00:02:17.770> hit<00:02:17.950> and<00:02:18.490> then<00:02:18.580> it's<00:02:18.700> like<00:02:18.730> Christmas

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
rocket hit and then it's like Christmas

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.949 
rocket hit and then it's like Christmas
and<00:02:19.510> you<00:02:19.569> get<00:02:19.690> a<00:02:19.720> little<00:02:19.870> bonus<00:02:20.170> treat<00:02:20.620> Santa

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
and you get a little bonus treat Santa

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.630 
and you get a little bonus treat Santa
one<00:02:22.959> final<00:02:23.349> tip<00:02:23.500> I'll<00:02:23.680> mention<00:02:23.890> is<00:02:24.159> for<00:02:24.340> firing

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
one final tip I'll mention is for firing

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:25.900 
one final tip I'll mention is for firing
at<00:02:24.849> moving<00:02:25.120> targets

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
at moving targets

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.730 
at moving targets
there's<00:02:26.240> obvious<00:02:26.690> delay<00:02:27.020> from<00:02:27.290> when<00:02:27.350> you<00:02:27.500> aim

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
there's obvious delay from when you aim

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.410 
there's obvious delay from when you aim
somewhere<00:02:28.190> to<00:02:28.400> win<00:02:28.520> the<00:02:28.640> rocket<00:02:29.000> will<00:02:29.120> alter

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
somewhere to win the rocket will alter

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.720 
somewhere to win the rocket will alter
its<00:02:29.570> course<00:02:29.630> and<00:02:30.110> this<00:02:30.830> gets<00:02:30.950> even<00:02:31.250> worse<00:02:31.460> the

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
its course and this gets even worse the

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.640 
its course and this gets even worse the
farther<00:02:31.910> away<00:02:32.090> that<00:02:32.390> the<00:02:32.510> target<00:02:32.810> is<00:02:32.840> so<00:02:33.530> it's

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
farther away that the target is so it's

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.320 
farther away that the target is so it's
a<00:02:33.680> good<00:02:33.770> idea<00:02:33.920> to<00:02:34.130> try<00:02:34.400> and<00:02:34.520> lead<00:02:34.700> your<00:02:34.880> targets

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
a good idea to try and lead your targets

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:36.910 
a good idea to try and lead your targets
and<00:02:35.900> you<00:02:36.080> won't<00:02:36.230> have<00:02:36.380> to<00:02:36.500> make<00:02:36.650> as<00:02:36.800> many

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
and you won't have to make as many

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.500 
and you won't have to make as many
adjustments<00:02:37.250> and<00:02:37.640> it's<00:02:37.820> easier<00:02:38.120> to<00:02:38.240> score<00:02:38.450> a

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
adjustments and it's easier to score a

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.750 
adjustments and it's easier to score a
hit<00:02:38.770> if<00:02:39.770> you've<00:02:39.920> always<00:02:40.100> loved<00:02:40.490> another

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
hit if you've always loved another

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.910 
hit if you've always loved another
launcher<00:02:41.240> time<00:02:41.840> to<00:02:41.960> break<00:02:42.230> off<00:02:42.440> that<00:02:42.650> stale

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
launcher time to break off that stale

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.010 
launcher time to break off that stale
relationship<00:02:43.580> and<00:02:44.060> go<00:02:44.090> out<00:02:44.270> for<00:02:44.420> a<00:02:44.450> wild<00:02:44.990> night

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
relationship and go out for a wild night

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.590 
relationship and go out for a wild night
on<00:02:45.260> the<00:02:45.350> town<00:02:45.530> of<00:02:45.590> the<00:02:45.830> straw<00:02:46.360> massive<00:02:47.360> damage

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
on the town of the straw massive damage

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.240 
on the town of the straw massive damage
combined<00:02:48.110> with<00:02:48.230> incredible<00:02:48.740> adaptability

make this the only launcher you will

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.620 
make this the only launcher you will
