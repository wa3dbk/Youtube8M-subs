00:00:08.949 --> 00:00:09.939
 Steven Rogers! 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.400
 Just give me a chance! - Sorry, son. 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.000
 DENIED 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:16.399
 I save her life. 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.199
 General Patton said the war was being fought with weapons ... 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:25.899
 ... but people win. 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.250
 You really don't know when to give up? 

00:00:30.473 --> 00:00:31.723
 We can continue all day long. 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.000
 Our goal is to create the best army in history ... 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.950
 I should go with you. 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.300
 - I know you wouldn't go ... - Steve, this is not an alley. It's war! 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.799
 ... but every army begins with a man. 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:47.000
 He tried five times in five cities. I can give you a chance. 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.050
 You will be the first of our new supercatars. 

00:00:54.611 --> 00:00:55.511
 Why me? 

00:00:55.712 --> 00:00:56.812
 Because a weak man ... 

00:00:57.013 --> 00:00:58.613
 ... appreciates the power. 

00:00:59.095 --> 00:01:00.795
 Appreciate power. 

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:04.700
 - It's not that bad. - It was just penicillin. 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.500
 We win the war because we have the best people ... 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.160
 Now, Mr. Stark! 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.580
 ... and we will personally accompany Adolf Hitler to the gate of hell! 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:34.599
 How do you feel? 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.160
 Larger. 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.999
 Their task will not be easy. 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.500
 - Who are you ?! - First of many. 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:49.900
 Their enemies ... 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.990
 ... not what they expect. 

00:02:09.401 --> 00:02:10.501
 I'm able to do it! 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.500
 That's why we chose it. 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.800
 What do you think? 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:28.850
 It could work.
