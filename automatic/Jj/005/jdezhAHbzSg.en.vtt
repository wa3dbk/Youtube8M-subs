the big tub of the arguing or and this
is<00:03:38.910> my<00:03:39.030> first<00:03:39.450> time<00:03:39.720> using<00:03:39.989> this<00:03:40.349> one<00:03:40.650> and<00:03:41.250> I

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
is my first time using this one and I

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.610 
is my first time using this one and I
really<00:03:41.639> really<00:03:41.790> like<00:03:42.030> it<00:03:42.060> I<00:03:42.450> had<00:03:42.810> the<00:03:43.079> olive

really really like it I had the olive

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.409 
really really like it I had the olive
oil<00:03:43.829> 1<00:03:44.069> I<00:03:44.250> didn't<00:03:44.669> really<00:03:44.760> use<00:03:44.880> much<00:03:45.120> of<00:03:45.150> it

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:45.419 
oil 1 I didn't really use much of it

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:46.460 
oil 1 I didn't really use much of it
because<00:03:45.660> I<00:03:45.690> had<00:03:45.989> it<00:03:46.169> when<00:03:46.290> I<00:03:46.349> was

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470

transitioning and in my daughter took it

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.420 
transitioning and in my daughter took it
it<00:03:49.410> probably<00:03:49.530> dried<00:03:49.859> up<00:03:49.980> a<00:03:50.040> little<00:03:50.220> bit<00:03:50.310> which

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
it probably dried up a little bit which

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.280
