opposing muscles so we started off with

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.660 
opposing muscles so we started off with
push-ups<00:01:49.110> for<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.409> chest<00:01:49.680> now<00:01:50.340> we're<00:01:50.520> moving

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
push-ups for the chest now we're moving

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.940 
push-ups for the chest now we're moving
on<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:50.970> seated<00:01:51.570> cable<00:01:51.750> rows<00:01:51.960> for<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.380> back<00:01:52.619> and

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
on to seated cable rows for the back and

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.039 
on to seated cable rows for the back and
this<00:01:53.610> is<00:01:53.759> a<00:01:53.790> good<00:01:54.000> move<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.270> help<00:01:54.540> build<00:01:54.780> back

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
this is a good move to help build back

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.380 
this is a good move to help build back
thickness<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:55.920> what<00:01:56.640> I<00:01:56.670> want<00:01:56.880> you<00:01:56.939> to<00:01:57.030> do<00:01:57.180> is

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
thickness and what I want you to do is

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.240 
thickness and what I want you to do is
really<00:01:57.659> focus<00:01:57.960> on<00:01:58.320> getting<00:01:58.469> a<00:01:58.710> good<00:01:58.740> peak

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
really focus on getting a good peak

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.490 
really focus on getting a good peak
contraction<00:01:59.610> and<00:02:00.000> squeezing<00:02:00.960> your<00:02:01.079> lats<00:02:01.259> at

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
contraction and squeezing your lats at

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.850 
contraction and squeezing your lats at
the<00:02:01.590> top<00:02:01.799> of<00:02:01.950> each<00:02:02.100> rep<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:03.590> the<00:02:04.590> next

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
the top of each rep and the next

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.859 
the top of each rep and the next
exercise<00:02:05.159> in<00:02:05.549> our<00:02:05.610> workout<00:02:06.000> is<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.240> standing

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
exercise in our workout is the standing

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.930 
exercise in our workout is the standing
shoulder<00:02:07.320> press<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:07.860> this<00:02:08.489> is<00:02:08.640> a<00:02:08.670> great

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
shoulder press and this is a great

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.699 
shoulder press and this is a great
overall<00:02:09.509> mass<00:02:09.810> building<00:02:10.259> move<00:02:10.440> for<00:02:10.649> the

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
overall mass building move for the

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.320 
overall mass building move for the
shoulders<00:02:11.160> and<00:02:11.400> I<00:02:12.390> like<00:02:12.540> to<00:02:12.660> do<00:02:12.750> this<00:02:12.900> extra

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
shoulders and I like to do this extra

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:14.910 
shoulders and I like to do this extra
standing<00:02:14.050> because<00:02:14.320> it's<00:02:14.470> going<00:02:14.620> to<00:02:14.680> help<00:02:14.770> to

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
standing because it's going to help to

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.350 
standing because it's going to help to
engage<00:02:15.040> more<00:02:15.520> of<00:02:15.610> the<00:02:15.730> core<00:02:16.000> and<00:02:16.210> the

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
engage more of the core and the

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.750 
engage more of the core and the
stabilizer<00:02:16.870> muscles<00:02:17.080> and<00:02:17.680> because<00:02:18.610> we're

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
stabilizer muscles and because we're

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.850 
stabilizer muscles and because we're
using<00:02:18.970> dumbbells<00:02:19.330> there's<00:02:20.050> more<00:02:20.290> freedom<00:02:20.770> of

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
using dumbbells there's more freedom of

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.320 
using dumbbells there's more freedom of
movement<00:02:20.920> and<00:02:21.430> a<00:02:21.520> better<00:02:21.790> range<00:02:22.090> of<00:02:22.270> motion

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
movement and a better range of motion

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.850 
movement and a better range of motion
compared<00:02:23.110> to<00:02:23.200> using<00:02:23.500> a<00:02:23.560> barbell<00:02:25.740> moving<00:02:26.740> on

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
compared to using a barbell moving on

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.440 
compared to using a barbell moving on
with<00:02:27.070> our<00:02:27.220> workout<00:02:27.550> we're<00:02:27.820> going<00:02:27.970> to<00:02:28.060> do<00:02:28.210> some

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
with our workout we're going to do some

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.510 
with our workout we're going to do some
lat<00:02:28.690> pull-downs<00:02:29.050> and<00:02:29.620> this<00:02:30.040> is<00:02:30.190> a<00:02:30.220> good

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
lat pull-downs and this is a good

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.610 
lat pull-downs and this is a good
exercise<00:02:30.850> to<00:02:31.090> help<00:02:31.480> add<00:02:31.720> width<00:02:32.080> to<00:02:32.350> the<00:02:32.380> back

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
exercise to help add width to the back

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.160 
exercise to help add width to the back
and<00:02:32.920> it<00:02:33.490> complements<00:02:34.150> the<00:02:34.240> previous<00:02:34.660> exercise

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
and it complements the previous exercise

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
maximum benefit from the pulldown you

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.890 
maximum benefit from the pulldown you
really<00:02:45.610> need<00:02:45.790> to<00:02:45.910> use<00:02:46.030> a<00:02:46.060> full<00:02:46.450> range<00:02:46.750> of

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
really need to use a full range of

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.930 
really need to use a full range of
motion<00:02:47.110> make<00:02:47.920> sure<00:02:48.070> to<00:02:48.220> get<00:02:48.280> a<00:02:48.340> full<00:02:48.640> stretch

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.059 

and<00:02:56.790> to<00:02:57.780> finish<00:02:58.050> off<00:02:58.230> our<00:02:58.440> workout<00:02:58.860> we're

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
and to finish off our workout we're

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:00.650 
and to finish off our workout we're
going<00:02:59.220> to<00:02:59.280> do<00:02:59.459> some<00:02:59.730> exercise<00:03:00.239> for<00:03:00.569> the

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
going to do some exercise for the

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.780 
going to do some exercise for the
midsection<00:03:01.379> and<00:03:01.530> this<00:03:02.040> right<00:03:02.250> here<00:03:02.400> is<00:03:02.459> the

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
midsection and this right here is the

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.540 
midsection and this right here is the
basic<00:03:03.239> abdominal<00:03:03.900> crunch<00:03:04.170> now<00:03:05.099> I<00:03:05.129> like<00:03:05.370> to<00:03:05.400> do

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
basic abdominal crunch now I like to do

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.640 
basic abdominal crunch now I like to do
my<00:03:05.700> crunches<00:03:05.910> with<00:03:06.300> my<00:03:06.450> feet<00:03:06.690> elevated<00:03:07.200> up<00:03:07.470> on

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
my crunches with my feet elevated up on

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.920 
my crunches with my feet elevated up on
a<00:03:07.709> flat<00:03:07.980> exercise<00:03:08.550> bench<00:03:08.910> and<00:03:09.180> I<00:03:09.629> find<00:03:09.870> that

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
a flat exercise bench and I find that

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.900 
a flat exercise bench and I find that
this<00:03:10.110> helps<00:03:10.410> to<00:03:10.500> isolate<00:03:11.040> the<00:03:11.190> upper<00:03:11.430> abs<00:03:11.640> to<00:03:11.879> a

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
this helps to isolate the upper abs to a

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.640 
this helps to isolate the upper abs to a
greater<00:03:12.180> degree<00:03:12.390> and<00:03:12.750> provide<00:03:13.319> a<00:03:13.349> better

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
greater degree and provide a better

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:19.190 
greater degree and provide a better
muscle<00:03:14.130> contraction<00:03:15.260> and<00:03:17.630> after<00:03:18.630> doing<00:03:19.019> the

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
muscle contraction and after doing the

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.110 
muscle contraction and after doing the
abdominal<00:03:19.830> crunch<00:03:20.040> I<00:03:20.250> like<00:03:20.430> to<00:03:20.550> move<00:03:20.670> on<00:03:20.849> and

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
abdominal crunch I like to move on and

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.089 
abdominal crunch I like to move on and
do<00:03:21.239> reverse<00:03:21.660> crunches<00:03:22.230> and<00:03:22.440> this<00:03:22.890> is

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:23.099 
do reverse crunches and this is

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:25.100 
do reverse crunches and this is
basically<00:03:23.370> the<00:03:23.790> opposite<00:03:24.299> move<00:03:24.510> and<00:03:24.750> it's

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
basically the opposite move and it's

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.680 
basically the opposite move and it's
going<00:03:25.290> to<00:03:25.380> target<00:03:25.590> the<00:03:25.920> lower<00:03:26.129> abs<00:03:26.489> now<00:03:27.420> in

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
going to target the lower abs now in

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:28.970 
going to target the lower abs now in
order<00:03:27.870> to<00:03:27.989> get<00:03:28.140> a<00:03:28.170> better<00:03:28.470> range<00:03:28.769> of<00:03:28.920> motion

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
order to get a better range of motion

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.580 
order to get a better range of motion
and<00:03:29.549> a<00:03:29.610> better<00:03:29.849> lower<00:03:30.090> ab<00:03:30.360> workout<00:03:30.390> I<00:03:31.049> like<00:03:31.470> to

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
and a better lower ab workout I like to

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.770 
and a better lower ab workout I like to
do<00:03:31.709> this<00:03:31.860> lying<00:03:32.310> on<00:03:32.580> a<00:03:32.610> flat<00:03:32.880> exercise<00:03:33.420> bench

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
do this lying on a flat exercise bench

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.750 
do this lying on a flat exercise bench
this<00:03:34.470> will<00:03:34.680> allow<00:03:34.890> you<00:03:34.950> to<00:03:35.069> lower<00:03:35.340> your<00:03:35.459> feet

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
this will allow you to lower your feet

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.670 
this will allow you to lower your feet
down<00:03:36.060> and<00:03:36.299> really<00:03:36.780> stretch<00:03:37.110> out<00:03:37.260> those<00:03:37.440> lower

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680

down and really stretch out those lower
abs<00:03:37.980> and<00:03:38.310> help<00:03:38.519> to<00:03:38.610> activate<00:03:38.760> the<00:03:39.150> muscles<00:03:39.269> to

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 
abs and help to activate the muscles to

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:42.259 
abs and help to activate the muscles to
a<00:03:39.630> greater<00:03:39.930> degree<00:03:40.519> now<00:03:41.519> if<00:03:41.819> you're<00:03:41.940> strong

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
a greater degree now if you're strong

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.120 
a greater degree now if you're strong
enough<00:03:42.299> you<00:03:42.840> can<00:03:42.989> actually<00:03:43.170> do<00:03:43.500> the<00:03:43.650> exercise

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
enough you can actually do the exercise

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.220 
enough you can actually do the exercise
with<00:03:44.430> your<00:03:44.519> legs<00:03:44.730> out<00:03:44.970> straight<00:03:45.000> and<00:03:45.630> this

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
with your legs out straight and this

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.199 
with your legs out straight and this
would<00:03:46.440> be<00:03:46.560> referred<00:03:46.890> to<00:03:47.130> as<00:03:47.340> a<00:03:47.370> lying<00:03:47.880> leg

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
would be referred to as a lying leg

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.330 
would be referred to as a lying leg
raise<00:03:48.510> I<00:03:48.750> mean<00:03:49.290> it<00:03:49.349> works<00:03:49.500> the<00:03:49.680> same<00:03:49.709> muscles

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
raise I mean it works the same muscles

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.190 
raise I mean it works the same muscles
as<00:03:50.519> the<00:03:50.640> reverse<00:03:50.910> crunch<00:03:51.150> but<00:03:51.750> again<00:03:51.959> it's<00:03:52.110> a

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
as the reverse crunch but again it's a

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.199 
as the reverse crunch but again it's a
more<00:03:52.410> advanced<00:03:52.709> variation<00:03:52.920> and<00:03:53.579> it's<00:03:53.790> harder

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
more advanced variation and it's harder

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:55.880 
more advanced variation and it's harder
due<00:03:54.480> to<00:03:54.660> leverage<00:03:55.079> where<00:03:55.380> your<00:03:55.500> legs<00:03:55.709> are

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
due to leverage where your legs are

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.210 
due to leverage where your legs are
extended

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.009

soon<00:04:30.770> and<00:04:31.090> with<00:04:32.090> the<00:04:32.210> exercise<00:04:32.720> order<00:04:33.260> I<00:04:33.410> want

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:33.889 
soon and with the exercise order I want

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:36.010 
soon and with the exercise order I want
you<00:04:33.979> to<00:04:34.100> do<00:04:34.280> a<00:04:34.580> technique<00:04:35.030> that's<00:04:35.300> called<00:04:35.479> jump

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
you to do a technique that's called jump

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.900 
you to do a technique that's called jump
sets<00:04:36.290> and<00:04:36.560> that<00:04:37.070> basically<00:04:37.520> means<00:04:37.639> just

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 
sets and that basically means just

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:39.550 
sets and that basically means just
alternating<00:04:38.690> back<00:04:38.870> and<00:04:38.900> forth<00:04:39.350> between

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
alternating back and forth between

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.280 
alternating back and forth between
opposing<00:04:40.310> muscle<00:04:40.669> groups<00:04:40.880> so<00:04:41.600> we<00:04:41.840> start<00:04:42.139> off

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.290 
opposing muscle groups so we start off

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:44.830 
opposing muscle groups so we start off
with<00:04:42.500> a<00:04:42.560> set<00:04:42.770> of<00:04:42.830> push-ups<00:04:43.100> and<00:04:43.550> then<00:04:44.270> do<00:04:44.479> a<00:04:44.510> set

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
with a set of push-ups and then do a set

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.020 
with a set of push-ups and then do a set
of<00:04:45.020> seated<00:04:45.350> cable<00:04:45.500> rows<00:04:45.710> then<00:04:46.460> do<00:04:46.610> your<00:04:46.729> next

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
of seated cable rows then do your next

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:48.460 
of seated cable rows then do your next
set<00:04:47.150> of<00:04:47.180> push-ups<00:04:47.419> your<00:04:47.840> next<00:04:48.020> set<00:04:48.139> of<00:04:48.169> seated

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
set of push-ups your next set of seated

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.350 
set of push-ups your next set of seated
cable<00:04:48.620> rows<00:04:48.830> and<00:04:49.130> keep<00:04:49.520> alternating<00:04:49.760> back<00:04:50.330> and

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
cable rows and keep alternating back and

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.510 
cable rows and keep alternating back and
forth<00:04:50.750> until<00:04:50.990> you<00:04:51.350> get<00:04:51.530> all<00:04:51.680> three<00:04:51.950> sets<00:04:52.220> and

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
forth until you get all three sets and

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.029 
forth until you get all three sets and
this<00:04:53.389> is<00:04:53.539> a<00:04:53.570> great<00:04:53.840> technique<00:04:54.229> that<00:04:54.289> you<00:04:54.889> can

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:55.039 
this is a great technique that you can

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:57.219 
this is a great technique that you can
use<00:04:55.190> for<00:04:55.430> all<00:04:55.610> your<00:04:55.760> exercises<00:04:56.450> so<00:04:56.870> the<00:04:57.020> same

00:04:57.219 --> 00:04:57.229 
use for all your exercises so the same

00:04:57.229 --> 00:04:59.170 
use for all your exercises so the same
thing<00:04:57.500> with<00:04:57.740> the<00:04:57.919> shoulder<00:04:58.520> press<00:04:58.669> and<00:04:58.970> the

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
thing with the shoulder press and the

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.909 
thing with the shoulder press and the
lat<00:04:59.360> pulldown<00:04:59.660> same<00:05:00.470> thing<00:05:00.710> with<00:05:00.830> the

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:00.919 
lat pulldown same thing with the

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:03.430 
lat pulldown same thing with the
crunches<00:05:01.370> and<00:05:01.580> the<00:05:01.729> reverse<00:05:02.060> crunches<00:05:02.539> and<00:05:02.750> by

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
crunches and the reverse crunches and by

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.870 
crunches and the reverse crunches and by
alternating<00:05:04.100> back<00:05:04.250> and<00:05:04.280> forth<00:05:04.729> between

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 
alternating back and forth between

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.969 
alternating back and forth between
opposing<00:05:05.570> muscle<00:05:05.840> groups<00:05:06.080> like<00:05:06.229> this<00:05:06.410> you'll

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:06.979 
opposing muscle groups like this you'll

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:08.440 
opposing muscle groups like this you'll
feel<00:05:07.220> stronger<00:05:07.850> and<00:05:08.030> have<00:05:08.210> more<00:05:08.389> energy

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:08.450
