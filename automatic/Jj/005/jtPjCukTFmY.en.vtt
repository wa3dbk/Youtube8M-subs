00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:54.450 
pushing away it puts tension on the

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.049 
pushing away it puts tension on the
blade<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:54.930> also<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:56.399> great<00:00:56.640> thing<00:00:56.820> about<00:00:56.879> a

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
little finger on here you can see by

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.160 
little finger on here you can see by
pulling<00:00:59.940> it<00:01:00.090> in<00:01:00.210> it<00:01:00.390> gives<00:01:00.600> me<00:01:00.750> a<00:01:00.780> lot<00:01:00.989> more

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
such as myself so this is my cutting

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.960 
such as myself so this is my cutting
position<00:02:10.390> when<00:02:11.200> I<00:02:11.230> rest<00:02:11.650> my<00:02:12.400> curve<00:02:12.760> the

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
position when I rest my curve the

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.680 
position when I rest my curve the

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
scissors round and I rest them here

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.550 
scissors round and I rest them here
sometimes<00:02:16.690> they're<00:02:16.870> there<00:02:17.080> sometimes

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
sometimes they're there sometimes

sometimes they're there sometimes
they're<00:02:17.740> here<00:02:18.240> depending<00:02:19.240> on<00:02:19.300> the<00:02:19.510> length<00:02:19.660> of

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
they're here depending on the length of

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.860 
they're here depending on the length of
the<00:02:19.930> blade<00:02:20.610> and<00:02:21.610> when<00:02:21.790> I<00:02:21.820> want<00:02:22.090> to<00:02:22.150> retrieve<00:02:22.630> my

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
the blade and when I want to retrieve my

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.180 
the blade and when I want to retrieve my
scissor<00:02:23.459> so<00:02:24.459> I've<00:02:24.850> lifted<00:02:25.060> a<00:02:25.300> section<00:02:25.720> up<00:02:26.190> they

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
scissor so I've lifted a section up they

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:33.270 
scissor so I've lifted a section up they
spin<00:02:27.640> around<00:02:29.880> my<00:02:30.880> car<00:02:31.260> now<00:02:32.260> this<00:02:32.470> movement<00:02:32.800> I

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
spin around my car now this movement I

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.340 
spin around my car now this movement I
find<00:02:33.760> difficult<00:02:33.940> doing<00:02:34.510> it<00:02:34.630> slowly<00:02:34.930> for<00:02:35.290> you

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
find difficult doing it slowly for you

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.550 
find difficult doing it slowly for you
because<00:02:36.160> normally<00:02:36.790> I<00:02:36.850> do<00:02:37.030> this<00:02:37.360> very<00:02:37.540> fast<00:02:37.660> way

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
because normally I do this very fast way

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.830 
because normally I do this very fast way
if<00:02:38.860> I<00:02:39.010> do<00:02:39.070> it<00:02:39.220> quickly<00:02:39.489> it<00:02:40.300> becomes<00:02:40.540> more

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
if I do it quickly it becomes more

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.479 
if I do it quickly it becomes more
natural<00:02:41.110> because<00:02:41.680> you're<00:02:41.920> not<00:02:42.040> thinking

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
natural because you're not thinking

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.060 
natural because you're not thinking
about<00:02:42.580> it<00:02:43.060> so<00:02:43.840> you<00:02:43.930> have<00:02:44.110> to<00:02:44.260> learn<00:02:44.470> the<00:02:44.739> slow

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
about it so you have to learn the slow

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:46.050 
about it so you have to learn the slow
way<00:02:45.310> first

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
way first

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.470 
way first
the<00:02:46.450> bigger<00:02:46.660> the<00:02:46.840> scissor<00:02:47.489> the<00:02:48.489> harder<00:02:49.180> it<00:02:49.330> is

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
the bigger the scissor the harder it is

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.759 
the bigger the scissor the harder it is
to<00:02:49.540> flick<00:02:49.959> on<00:02:50.110> the<00:02:50.230> knee<00:02:50.320> you<00:02:50.470> got<00:02:50.620> to<00:02:50.709> be

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
to flick on the knee you got to be

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:55.759 
to flick on the knee you got to be
careful<00:02:51.010> then<00:02:51.400> how<00:02:52.530> we<00:02:53.530> hold<00:02:53.800> our<00:02:54.300> scissors

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769
