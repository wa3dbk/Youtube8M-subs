00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:06.020
 hello guys and girls like this one that I am 

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:08.240
 cupcake and once again I'm super 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:10.969
 happy and super happy because I'm 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.339
 recording this video is a super idea 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:15.200
 father that we can elaborate on this 

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:17.600
 moment or when we come back from 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:20.660
 our vacation in case you go to 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:23.180
 the beach go to the sea his friends his 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:26.029
 friends can then start 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.580
 collect shells and use myself 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:32.000
 I used these conchitas for this idea 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:35.420
 that the truth was given to me by others 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.070
 snails gave them to me or also 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.050
 you can find them in stores of a 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.450
 only price in stores maybe from 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.790
 crafts are easy to get the 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.520
 truth is that I invite you to 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:49.880
 you stay and together we are going to elaborate this 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:52.700
 super nice idea such we are going to need 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:55.070
 a mirror a piece of cardboard a little 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.730
 larger than the mirror with a circle 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.160
 in the center 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.670
 with silicone and silicone gun and 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.019
 conchitas to decorate 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.150
 The first thing we will do is paste 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:30.750
 our cardboard circle with silicone 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:32.910
 hot on the mirror once being 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.160
 very well stuck the cardboard to the mirror 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:39.290
 We started to glue small shells on the 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.290
 cardboard with the design of your preference 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:48.720
 will arrive very random so I 'll just hit 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.910
 the shells and glue them to finish 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.470
 I will use the snails to cover 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.470
 completely the spaces 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.190
 do not 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:14.280
 we met we give a little rope or 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.650
 lath on the back of the mirror 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.280
 this part can be done before 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.280
 decorate it 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:33.050
 It is also important to paste with a 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:35.090
 much more resistant glue I think 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:39.680
 that a little cloth to prevent it from 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:41.959
 detach easily and well we have 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:46.190
 ready a super nice mirror for 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:48.580
 give to our mom or to decorate 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.860
 our room 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.780
 and good guys that was all for the day 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.300

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.970
