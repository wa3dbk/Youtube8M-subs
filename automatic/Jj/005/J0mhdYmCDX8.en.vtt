00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
and I believe that's actually 8mm rather

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:01.490 
and I believe that's actually 8mm rather
than<00:02:56.880> 10<00:02:57.090> mil<00:02:57.889> it<00:02:58.889> is<00:02:59.100> actually<00:02:59.519> 8<00:02:59.670> mil<00:03:00.350> all<00:03:01.350> we

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
than 10 mil it is actually 8 mil all we

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.930 
than 10 mil it is actually 8 mil all we
have<00:03:01.650> to<00:03:01.739> do<00:03:01.859> is<00:03:02.010> Oh<00:03:04.370> loosen<00:03:05.370> these<00:03:05.519> three

bolts<00:03:06.269> off<00:03:06.450> here<00:03:07.250> that<00:03:08.250> should<00:03:08.579> give<00:03:08.790> us<00:03:08.819> a

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
bolts off here that should give us a

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:15.470 
bolts off here that should give us a
room<00:03:11.690> to<00:03:12.690> take<00:03:12.870> the<00:03:12.989> oil<00:03:13.260> filter<00:03:13.470> out<00:03:14.420> okay<00:03:15.420> so

the<00:03:20.790> oil<00:03:21.030> filter<00:03:21.239> now<00:03:21.569> it<00:03:21.690> actually<00:03:21.989> helps<00:03:22.290> if

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
the oil filter now it actually helps if

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.259 
the oil filter now it actually helps if
you<00:03:22.590> put<00:03:22.620> the<00:03:22.919> shifter<00:03:23.340> in<00:03:23.489> neutral<00:03:23.970> that<00:03:24.150> will

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
you put the shifter in neutral that will

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:25.870 
you put the shifter in neutral that will
raise<00:03:24.480> it<00:03:24.660> to<00:03:24.780> its<00:03:24.900> highest<00:03:25.109> point<00:03:25.560> the

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
raise it to its highest point the

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.069 
raise it to its highest point the
neutral<00:03:26.880> forward<00:03:27.269> I<00:03:27.419> actually<00:03:27.569> think<00:03:27.810> it's<00:03:27.989> in

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
neutral forward I actually think it's in

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:28.879 
neutral forward I actually think it's in
high<00:03:28.260> right<00:03:28.530> now

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:28.889 
high right now

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:32.809 
high right now
