00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.969
 Chilean port workers 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.370
 demand the fulfillment of an agreement 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:16.869
 after a strike last year 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.369
 the reason our realization has to 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:20.500
 see with the subject of the retroactive payment 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:22.390
 of the half decoration I do not know if you 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.710
 Agrees last year 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.660
 when we talked in March it's true 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.890
 It was a pity the paralysis 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.630
 for the right to half an hour of 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.739
 collation when I put companies in 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.970
 through the collation of course 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:32.439
 the workers begin to ask 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.290
 we communicate with the half hour snack 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:37.360
 from 2003 backwards the authorities and 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.370
 entrepreneurs do not want to talk and their 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.710
 representatives move in shape 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.170
 semi-clandestine fearful of the 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:48.429
 strikers labor law in chile is 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:51.300
 precarious is a question that has not 

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:53.320
 changed not a comma many years ago 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.999
 then and when they change 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.489
 unfortunately against us 

00:00:54.999 --> 00:01:00.280
 workers always in favor of the 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:02.350
 entrepreneurs therefore we do not 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.510
 let's put with the law we go with the 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.400
 rights that are and are above all 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.159
 the rights that are universal the 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.020
 right to strain is a universal right 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.300
 the government accuses workers of 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.630
 blackmail and selfishness 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:19.280
 and warns them here not to have any 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:22.880
 weakness and if someone 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:25.159
 does not comply with the law I mean that the 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.880
 law will fall with all its rigor 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:32.240
 because that's the only way we 're never going 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.820
 to allow neither violence nor 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.520
 terrorism prevail the police is 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.530
 ready the workers too and 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.390
 sign the assistance book for 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.009
 approve the rumor that they come 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.080
 scabs to break the movement 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.909
 tension to the workers in the

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.950

 Chilean port exceeds 222 thousand 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.229

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.390
 investments are substantial so lucia 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:02.000
 this beach less than a year ago and so 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:05.090
 the retroactive payment that motivates 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.080
 the strike would cost just 20 million
