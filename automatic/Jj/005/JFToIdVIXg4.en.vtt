00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 hello I have my hair routine 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.779
 for you because some of you have 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.760
 I ask you my update again 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.219
 can turn and of course I do that 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.080
 also like to have me in now 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.389
 Lately, changed some to 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.310
 That's why I thought of one 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.480
 I'll do it again for half a year 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:25.050
 a new video and then I start 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.830
 just gradually like me 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.170
 Action 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.170
 I was already my hair about every 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.989
 two to three days mostly two days in 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.489
 the holidays three days because there I have 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.930
 not so often river mine have indeed 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.030
 So I'm already showering but already 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.090
 I do not wash my hair that often 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:46.320
 so that they have a little rest 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:48.719
 from the whole products and during the 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.070
 So I take a shower when washing my hair 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.250
 always two different ones 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.710
 he shampoos my time long namely the 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.539
 tens again for a while and other things 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.699
 because it really always varies that 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.770
 feel that the effect in the absences 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.539
 I do not know why I'm doing them 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.659
 so and I even take that from 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:10.740
 thierry henry born here and then from 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.119
 frieda young chang coo at the ball and 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.770
 I always feel that shampoo 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.509
 they are so stressful so so 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.520
 not in the sense of that now finished 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.500
 and stony but i know 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.330
 not even sometimes they just become like that 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.299
 stony want what she fights then 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.360
 then they are just beautiful again 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.950
 I do not know if we know that and that 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.470
 I think it's quite good and my hand 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.240
 we are getting easier and easier 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.930
 a bit fluffy is that kinda 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.750
 with pleasure 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.930
 and because this tc herborn I think 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.060
 a very nice result at all 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.640
 I believe that from the drugstore 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.280
 can come there as well , I believe 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.320
 I do not have to be such a part now 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.940
 buy for the price but I have that 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.030
 Now my mum has a spring 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.500
 taken along and that's why I have that 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.810
 now also used and is now too 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.040
 almost empty 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.020
 but I think you do not have to 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.930
 buy it but that is really 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.060
 a recommendation to john frieda that very much 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.430
 likes 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:10.190
 and yes those are sharp tight time 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:13.040
 really take after washing the hair 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:16.940
 It's about my hair towel inlet first 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.709
 let it dry so easily and then I can 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.440
 you have the taser through me now 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.570
 to a mini mini penaltys but the 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.200
 I guess her only in the wet state 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:29.660
 because if those are affected and 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.540
 thus effectively often through very 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:35.720
 electrically and made condition I think 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.760
 the better because I then easy 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.890
 but my hair comes through most of the time 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.530
 I then let my hair dry 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.959
 because I so often rapid evening 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.519
 and Dorner just like to dry overnight 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.410
 but if it's a bit faster 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:51.650
 I always have to go from there 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:55.700
 Caritas reflection in her packaging 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.560
 a heat protection he and I do 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.470
 really like it because it's right 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.920
 really good street good and good 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:07.190
 slc special editions agent i ever 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.989
 had and i just loved it i was 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:12.500
 Unfortunately, I am not exactly hurrying it is 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:14.540
 Sometime somewhere a blind but that 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.340
 I will definitely buy after 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.160
 because I just like that and so much 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.769
 to blow so I think is beautiful 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.540
 really very important and then always 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:27.380
 the brahms 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:29.350
 Mr. 7 and he has it too 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.940
 an ion technique 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:35.600
 I think that should be for that 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:38.209
 I wet my hair like that 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.440
 to be dried when blow-drying 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:40.490
 I do not really know if that 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.840
 is working 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:45.800
 not but I have a good one anyway 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:48.680
 feel it when I feel it and that 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.830
 even better for me so far had that 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.390
 I really like it very much 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.100
 and every one or two weeks I take 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.830
 always a hair mask and that 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:00.170
 is this one of these pira stars 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:02.720
 his orange packaging is called o leary 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.500
 lex I think it costs about 20 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.710
 Euro 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.850
 I will be you too, I will be you all 

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:10.640
 products also my life for vox 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:13.280
 link and am I doing 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.590
 pretty much and that makes my hair 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.570
 just really nice and supple 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.060
 nice and I think it's a re 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:23.090
 I did not have the best hamas and me 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:27.640
 like to use it totally like must stress 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:30.470
 in combination with this heat protection 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:34.040
 Cream does not know how it's insolvency 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.840
 No spray because my hair is in the end 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.480
 so beautiful so are by 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.550
 It simply shines on what you look like 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.770
 Of course it can not be imagined 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:46.820
 everyday life worthy favorite but 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:48.890
 then my duty would be 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:52.160
 and that though for the hair the whole 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:53.540
 Products but once a week when I am 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.730
 I know I'm going away 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:59.270
 every day that's ours 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:01.760
 Men just so nice so here I am 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:05.000
 just completely satisfied with those 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:08.930
 because you can not describe 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:12.770
 so beautiful and you have to just like that 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:14.630
 Try myself because channel I can 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.890
 since not say anything so beautiful sometimes 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.410
 never again 

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:22.280
 and that's why I use the stuff like that 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:24.410
 like because as I said you can 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.690
 describes and they all have one 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:27.569
 very good high so especially the gate 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:30.179
 so 

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:35.849
 Today is indescribably love him 

00:05:30.179 --> 00:05:38.490
 easy and then every one to two 

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:40.529
 weeks as a take care cut 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.809
 about every three months 

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:46.679
 bit my sharp and I do 

00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:49.409
 by putting a braid on my head 

00:05:46.679 --> 00:05:50.999
 Tie and then use my hair with the comb 

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:51.839
 comb through and then and a bit 

00:05:50.999 --> 00:05:54.479
 may cut 

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:58.289
 So I do that in the wet state I 

00:05:54.479 --> 00:06:00.599
 make it dry , but with it 

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:03.509
 you can imagine that approximately 

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:05.969
 and I have such a scissors here 

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:08.459
 I bought the dm for seven or 

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:09.599
 eight euros and I think it has become 

00:06:08.459 --> 00:06:11.669
 really worth it because then you have to 

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:13.709
 Do not always go to the hairdresser and have to 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:15.869
 I do not really feel right at once 

00:06:13.709 --> 00:06:17.969
 cut off because the hair to hood and 

00:06:15.869 --> 00:06:20.369
 so you can always snow again 

00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:22.830
 and I block movies it says so 

00:06:20.369 --> 00:06:26.519
 which break at the tips faster 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:28.830
 as a dark hair that's why I have to 

00:06:26.519 --> 00:06:32.490
 more often times cut and look 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:36.360
 whether they are going to be broken again or 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:38.459
 how the points are and why 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:40.139
 edged the flat itself always in 

00:06:38.459 --> 00:06:40.769
 My hair is also growing very much 

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:42.330
 slowly 

00:06:40.769 --> 00:06:44.069
 That's why I do not go to it that often 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:46.740
 puzzle because that's just not us 

00:06:44.069 --> 00:06:49.469
 is worth it for me and then gives it all 

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:51.809
 six to eight months to the hairdresser and 

00:06:49.469 --> 00:06:56.369
 dani i also go to a something 

00:06:51.809 --> 00:06:59.069
 is more expensive the same costs for me 

00:06:56.369 --> 00:07:01.409
 so ca between 30 and 50 euro I know 

00:06:59.069 --> 00:07:04.860
 it not just because the most 

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:09.300
 my mum pays for me but about 

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:11.759
 but something like that and I am torn 

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:13.919
 It's really worth it if you go there 

00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:16.379
 ran someone he really can be 

00:07:13.919 --> 00:07:18.240
 know who because of unknowing and the 

00:07:16.379 --> 00:07:21.370
 I know what he does most of the time I go 

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:23.410
 even to frustration just say to him 

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:26.460
 I've been here for four years in the 

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:29.139
 and told them years presented proposals 

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:32.380
 suggest it was his year we do 

00:07:29.139 --> 00:07:36.760
 because we already know a bit 

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:38.680
 better and then I already know something 

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:41.229
 could stand and that we are not quite 

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:45.340
 good if you have such a hairdresser where you 

00:07:41.229 --> 00:07:48.550
 goes and I think so too very 

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:52.180
 important that you do not have such a thing 

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:56.289
 Cheap frustration is not so good 

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:58.360
 are trained and I wanted that 

00:07:56.289 --> 00:08:00.520
 Now again I hope that 

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:05.410
 again you liked it was really 

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:08.400
 everything I do my hair and then 

00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:08.400
 until next time
