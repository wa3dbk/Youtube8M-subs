00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.930
 the entire opportunity to debut in the 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.970
 professional soccer in Juan's game 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.559
 aurich the wheel reddish black eduardo 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.540

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:13.009
 in the first division on the last Sunday 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.719
 facing the 'cyclone of the north' 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:16.820
 opportunity that waited for a good 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:19.310
 time until it finally happened not 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.829
 I think the game was a little bit 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.770
 little still moved because we were in 

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:26.419
 some football series dreams teacher 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:31.040
 Inside gave tranquility not tranquility 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:33.230
 that between doing what because I know and the 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:37.129
 peer support from all the 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:41.179
 team I think between and a bridge a 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:43.100
 work so that not acceptable not and 

00:00:41.179 --> 00:00:44.960
 continue to continue working now 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.100
 tower is also grateful for 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.899
 the opportunity that the 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.920
 Franco Navarre coach in addition to 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:50.769
 appreciate the chance to share 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.960
 dressing rooms with experience players 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:55.510
 I thank the 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.730
 to the free professional 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.100
 and quiet not calm and continue 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.730
 working to do to have a little 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.730
 more than continuity 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.520
 a tremendous joy to work with 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:10.250
 great players a lot more with a duck 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.909
 which has a great material trajectory 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.680
 great and good not to follow us I think 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.259
 that we have arrived are two for you that 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.860
 they come to melgar nothing to continue working 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:24.020
 in we can give much more to melgar and 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.700
 to give us an opportunity and 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.409
 keep working but you do not get 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.759
 issue an important wish since the 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:30.950
 first team is your brother 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:32.630
 minor gustavo who has also had the 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.580
 chance to debut in the tournament 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.039
 so he hopes to have some 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:40.060
 minutes with him on the playing field that 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:42.619
 is what we all want not only 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.289
 keep working I think that the 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:47.390
 opportunities are going to present themselves and I 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:49.369
 I think we should take advantage of it, I do not know 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.630
 if it will be now or later only 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.130
 let's hope they give us the opportunity 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.409
 be together 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.570
 thank all the people that we 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.670
 supported and now to move forward and 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.229
 keep working now towers wait 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.030
 have greater opportunities in the 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.590
 plant something that will only depend on your 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.390
 work taking into account that the front 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.340
 is short and therefore the option of 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.340
 Alternate power is left alone on your feet
