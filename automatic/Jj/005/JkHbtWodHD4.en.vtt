wheels<00:01:03.090> out<00:01:03.329> on<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.660> same<00:01:03.899> night<00:01:04.170> I<00:01:04.559> blew<00:01:05.519> out

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
wheels out on the same night I blew out

the<00:01:05.700> front<00:01:06.000> wheel<00:01:06.119> first<00:01:06.650> then<00:01:07.650> I<00:01:07.680> resorted<00:01:08.159> to

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
the front wheel first then I resorted to

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.710 
the front wheel first then I resorted to
three<00:01:08.520> wheels<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.030> next<00:01:09.360> thing<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:09.570> know

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
three wheels and the next thing you know

three wheels and the next thing you know
another<00:01:10.470> wheel<00:01:10.979> blows<00:01:11.250> out<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.490> next<00:01:11.820> coal

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
another wheel blows out the next coal

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.600 
another wheel blows out the next coal
yards<00:01:12.450> so<00:01:12.810> I<00:01:13.110> was<00:01:13.619> forced<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.010> skate<00:01:14.280> on<00:01:14.310> four

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
yards so I was forced to skate on four

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.160 
yards so I was forced to skate on four
wheels<00:01:14.850> on<00:01:15.090> my<00:01:15.180> left<00:01:15.390> skate<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:15.780> two<00:01:15.900> wheels

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
on my right it actually worked and

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.260 
on my right it actually worked and
surprisingly<00:01:19.950> felt<00:01:20.280> lighter<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.880> slightly

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
surprisingly felt lighter and slightly

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.330 
surprisingly felt lighter and slightly
faster<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:22.140> more<00:01:22.590> or<00:01:22.710> less<00:01:22.770> awkwardly

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
faster and more or less awkwardly

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.210 
faster and more or less awkwardly
balanced<00:01:23.939> but<00:01:24.420> now<00:01:24.990> I<00:01:25.020> know<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.799> always<00:01:26.100> bring

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
balanced but now I know to always bring

wheels<00:01:36.990> I<00:01:37.380> got<00:01:37.710> for<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.070> sweet<00:01:38.310> deal<00:01:38.460> off<00:01:38.700> of

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
wheels I got for a sweet deal off of

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.350 
wheels I got for a sweet deal off of
Amazon<00:01:39.240> 20<00:01:40.140> bucks<00:01:40.380> for<00:01:41.000> 16<00:01:42.000> wheels<00:01:42.240> oh<00:01:42.810> yeah

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
Amazon 20 bucks for 16 wheels oh yeah

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.569 
Amazon 20 bucks for 16 wheels oh yeah
but<00:01:45.360> then<00:01:45.479> I<00:01:45.509> realized<00:01:45.960> their<00:01:46.140> lifespan<00:01:46.710> was<00:01:46.979> 2

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
but then I realized their lifespan was 2

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.840 
but then I realized their lifespan was 2
or<00:01:47.729> 3<00:01:47.880> months<00:01:48.030> or<00:01:48.509> so<00:01:49.399> quality<00:01:50.399> durability

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
or 3 months or so quality durability

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.109 
or 3 months or so quality durability
doesn't<00:01:51.689> equal<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.049> low<00:01:52.229> price<00:01:52.560> sometimes<00:01:53.159> so

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
doesn't equal a low price sometimes so

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.940 
doesn't equal a low price sometimes so
I'm<00:01:54.240> shifting<00:01:54.509> my<00:01:54.689> mindset<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.439> extend<00:01:55.829> my

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
I'm shifting my mindset to extend my

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.730 
I'm shifting my mindset to extend my
search<00:01:56.219> on<00:01:56.549> a<00:01:56.640> new<00:01:56.939> pair<00:01:57.180> of<00:01:57.210> skates<00:01:57.570> once<00:01:57.990> the

for<00:05:28.610> dinning<00:05:28.850> speed<00:05:29.150> I<00:05:29.450> like<00:05:30.050> to<00:05:30.200> move<00:05:30.350> my<00:05:30.530> arms

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860 
for dinning speed I like to move my arms

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.190 
for dinning speed I like to move my arms
like<00:05:31.190> a<00:05:31.220> person<00:05:31.760> running<00:05:31.970> and<00:05:32.510> keeping<00:05:33.110> the

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:33.200 
like a person running and keeping the

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.880 
like a person running and keeping the
arms<00:05:33.470> bent

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:33.890 
arms bent

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.640 
arms bent
instead<00:05:34.340> of<00:05:34.520> keeping<00:05:35.120> them<00:05:35.270> straight<00:05:35.630> it<00:05:36.380> just

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:36.650 
instead of keeping them straight it just

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.960 
instead of keeping them straight it just
seems<00:05:36.919> more<00:05:37.790> natural<00:05:38.270> in<00:05:38.360> my<00:05:38.510> opinion<00:05:39.970> posture

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:40.970 
seems more natural in my opinion posture

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:44.590 
seems more natural in my opinion posture
plays<00:05:41.330> a<00:05:41.720> key<00:05:42.260> role<00:05:42.290> in<00:05:42.560> form<00:05:43.010> and<00:05:43.419> without<00:05:44.419> it

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:44.600 
plays a key role in form and without it

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.060 
plays a key role in form and without it
I<00:05:44.690> think<00:05:44.870> it's<00:05:44.990> kind<00:05:45.200> of<00:05:45.260> hard<00:05:45.470> to<00:05:45.650> really<00:05:45.830> make

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.070 
I think it's kind of hard to really make

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:48.190 
I think it's kind of hard to really make
it<00:05:46.100> believable<00:05:46.430> for<00:05:47.150> other<00:05:47.300> people<00:05:47.720> who<00:05:48.020> look

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:48.200 
it believable for other people who look

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.890 
it believable for other people who look
at<00:05:48.320> you<00:05:48.500> to<00:05:48.710> try<00:05:49.040> and<00:05:49.370> influence<00:05:50.060> them<00:05:50.690> to

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:50.900 
at you to try and influence them to

at you to try and influence them to
skate<00:05:51.220> as<00:05:52.220> well<00:05:52.550> but<00:05:53.480> don't<00:05:53.720> worry<00:05:53.990> about<00:05:54.110> the

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:54.350
