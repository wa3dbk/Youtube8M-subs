00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
not just a piece of furniture that comes

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.440 
not just a piece of furniture that comes
off<00:02:09.110> a<00:02:09.140> machine<00:02:09.440> and<00:02:10.009> has<00:02:10.250> sharp<00:02:10.610> edges<00:02:10.789> or

through<00:02:14.299> my<00:02:14.420> hand<00:02:14.660> tools<00:02:14.930> I<00:02:15.170> think<00:02:15.290> that's

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
through my hand tools I think that's

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.309 
through my hand tools I think that's
kind<00:02:15.920> of<00:02:15.980> what<00:02:16.180> personalizes<00:02:17.180> and<00:02:17.540> makes<00:02:18.140> it

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
kind of what personalizes and makes it

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:20.229 
kind of what personalizes and makes it
different<00:02:18.680> from<00:02:18.830> what<00:02:19.280> someone<00:02:19.879> else<00:02:20.060> would

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
different from what someone else would

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:22.539 
different from what someone else would
do<00:02:20.390> I<00:02:20.599> find<00:02:21.230> a<00:02:21.349> lot<00:02:21.500> of<00:02:21.560> inspiration<00:02:21.950> just

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:22.549 
do I find a lot of inspiration just

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:25.559 
do I find a lot of inspiration just
through<00:02:23.360> the<00:02:23.569> woods<00:02:24.170> I<00:02:24.500> use<00:02:25.099> through
