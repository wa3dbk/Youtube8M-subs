00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:24.999
 there is still some bad luck 

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:27.409
 that's why 

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:32.110
 in the world in worldly things and that they are not just the material 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.110
 then at least everything the world has to offer 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.740
 looking for our luck 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.070
 who are totally dependent 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.380
 because depending on the situations the alfa ments 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:51.140
 People would have things that changed more in July with our senses 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.170
 that and happy 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.610
 and they can not always do that 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.270
 if we depend on it 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.790
 this dependence is and freedom 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.680
 the brother promised us freedom 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.400
 van Gaal never got that far the work arrived 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.580
 that would be everything at all 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.650
 but we are got to have acted 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.390
 we are not happy yet 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.940
 completely brought in trouble and incidence inside happiness 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.900
 then the moment has come where the urgency of the practice and clings 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.360
 the urgency of the practice 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.850
 now brings 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.200
 on the way as I already did 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.200
 very much 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.190
 satisfaction 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.070
 because she is not 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.130
 makes dependent 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.800
 from others 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.310
 Children are practiced properly 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:52.910
 rather 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.190
 solely dependent on one's own 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:57.370
 right 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:58.900
 formations 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:59.939
 from their own 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.230
 with birth defects 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:03.910
 that's it 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.650
 a very important step now 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.099
 to examine their own products 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:11.200
 Oil is said very often 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.619
 if someone comes only superficially closer to Buddhism 

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:17.639
 that's very pessimistic, they're always talking about Tucher 

00:02:18.419 --> 00:02:20.160
 it is exactly the opposite 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.210
 it is neither optimistic nor pessimistic it is realistic 

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:27.399
 the boulevard 

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:30.399
 an intact, quite realistic teacher 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:34.019
 pragmatic to extreme 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.659
 Time said that's how it looks from life 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:39.769
 and that was two and a half thousand years ago 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:43.529
 and despite all the buttons this one can interpret today and the whole 

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:47.519
 comes before which we have the time still exactly so Rath 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:50.149
 nothing has changed 

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:52.139
 into his inner life 

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:55.779
 It looks the same from Yemen in the lives of people back then 

00:02:56.589 --> 00:03:01.929
 but we tried to somehow get rid of Duke r by taking the 

00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:05.729
 People have changed the situation of other people's days 

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:07.889
 have that are to blame 

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:10.299
 and everything else we do 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:11.899
 to attempt 

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:13.939
 and then some of them 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:17.049
 have come up with the idea 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:19.739
 it does not matter what's outside 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.739
 Titian me the tears 

00:03:23.279 --> 00:03:25.809
 when that moment has come 

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:26.829
 your 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:29.759
 you can look for easy 

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:32.339
 when facing yourself 

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:34.619
 truthfully 

00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:36.199
 because want to take 

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:38.709
 look and say 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.369
 I'm a fool 

00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:42.879
 to make myself unhappy 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:44.639
 what for 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:47.879
 and we think that she says to herself then you are on the way 

00:03:49.089 --> 00:03:53.050
 where can my rude Russ word use as a nutritious steger 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.980
 no matter 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.579
 it should only make sense 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:59.070
 India that you yourself 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:00.829
 makes you unhappy 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:03.139
 Moment have seen that 

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:05.199
 then we are not looking anymore 

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:07.719
 out there and saddled 

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:10.719
 the most comfortable is and did not have different 

00:04:11.249 --> 00:04:15.069
 we still have Thiermann fill up a completely different positional error 

00:04:17.059 --> 00:04:20.059
 but we are looking for happiness 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.289
 and there it is 

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:26.569
 there exists 

00:04:26.569 --> 00:04:29.550
 but in a very different way 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.550
 as you might have thought so far 

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:35.759
 and maybe help us once 

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:37.949
 what I explained earlier 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:40.129
 with the position now 

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:43.129
 to let go of the reactions 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:46.400
 and get to know what it means 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.159
 not to react 

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:49.419
 and the Lord 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:51.740
 to have no printer 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.820
 unpleasant feeling is and an attitude to life 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:04:58.240
 does not mean to react 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.620
 to have no printer at the moment 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.919
 will it react because then it will be back later on that is clear 

00:05:05.059 --> 00:05:07.979
 your own momeni 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:10.589
 the desire to let go 

00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:11.710
 it should 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.400
 be different 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.400
 that's not our whole doctor 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.150
 as this past us it should not be one of them 

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:25.520
 and if we carry something with us 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.960
 and many people do 11 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.990
 what happened in the past 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.250
 in the distant past Middle past right now 

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:38.330
 which did not fit 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.620
 and we therefore 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.620
 saddened about it and the most annoying 

00:05:45.309 --> 00:05:50.189
 once a moment drop the idea it should have been different too 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.990
 and feel the relief 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:57.990
 it should not be the same as it was 

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:02.099
 as well as SES it is 

00:06:03.749 --> 00:06:06.529
 what did humanity say? 

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:10.379
 what are forgiven in human history at all 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.349
 have the transcript of it 

00:06:15.349 --> 00:06:17.319
 what happened 

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:19.050
 everything would have been different 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:19.820
 know 

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:21.400
 but not 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.499
 so threw 

00:06:22.499 --> 00:06:25.930
 and that's how it is today 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:27.419
 war everywhere 

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:30.069
 everywhere Erler 

00:06:30.069 --> 00:06:33.069
 about a desired and desires 

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:37.229
 and if the dog is something personal 

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:39.819
 with and therefore wear that does not suit us 

00:06:39.819 --> 00:06:41.169
 anything 

00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:44.169
 whole little thing or something bigger 

00:06:45.249 --> 00:06:49.050
 What kind of a bit agitation intensified inside 

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:54.409
 This probably not that this one thing should be different 

00:06:55.559 --> 00:06:58.430
 cause 

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:01.069
 and then who knows what it means 

00:07:01.069 --> 00:07:04.069
 the first and second Peter was 

00:07:04.899 --> 00:07:06.280
 then we have them 

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:07.509
 even 

00:07:07.509 --> 00:07:09.930
 examined 

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:13.219
 first booker with second is there are only printers 

00:07:13.219 --> 00:07:16.849
 because we want something to be different 

00:07:16.849 --> 00:07:19.849
 where do you want to either hair code air? 

00:07:20.449 --> 00:07:22.119
 in that moment 

00:07:22.119 --> 00:07:23.040
 where are 

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.509
 let go once 

00:07:25.509 --> 00:07:29.180
 and of course we can do it again after one minute 

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:31.619
 LeMond continues to carry us around 

00:07:31.619 --> 00:07:33.009
 that is clear 

00:07:33.009 --> 00:07:37.239
 but if we have experienced that one minute of relief, we know each other 

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.319
 as it is possible 

00:07:40.319 --> 00:07:43.319
 to create freedom in us 

00:07:44.249 --> 00:07:48.649
 this freedom then refers to our entire team alongside 

00:07:49.749 --> 00:07:52.710
 and yet ghosts and then in stores 

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:56.010
 and even the opposite in business 

00:07:57.189 --> 00:07:59.979
 and who he is, so to speak 

00:07:59.979 --> 00:08:02.689
 able to choose 

00:08:02.689 --> 00:08:07.189
 but Apple unfortunately can not do that in which he just say so from now on 

00:08:07.189 --> 00:08:10.249
 only Super Duke is out of the question 

00:08:10.249 --> 00:08:12.249
 Unfortunately, the game does not work 

00:08:12.249 --> 00:08:13.379
 there you have to do something
