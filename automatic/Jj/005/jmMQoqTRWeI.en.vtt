00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.285
 Hello! Welcome to kitchen for all. 

00:00:02.385 --> 00:00:05.347
 Today we are going to make a Philadelphia cheese cake without an oven. 

00:00:05.647 --> 00:00:08.518
 And to do it we are going to need the following ingredients: 

00:00:09.118 --> 00:00:12.195
 For the base 18 mary-type cookies, 

00:00:13.195 --> 00:00:14.873
 40 go a heaping tablespoon of butter, 

00:00:15.373 --> 00:00:17.774
 and if necessary a splash of milk. 

00:00:18.374 --> 00:00:23.158
 For the filling 350 g of Philadelphia spreads, 

00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:27.699
 1 cup and 2/5 or 350 ml of whipping cream also known as whipping cream 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:31.118
 with approximately 35% fat. 

00:00:32.118 --> 00:00:33.691
 1/3 cup or 70 g of sugar 

00:00:34.603 --> 00:00:39.312
 and 4 sheets of neutral gelatine or 7 g of neutral gelatin powder 

00:00:39.312 --> 00:00:41.027
 or also called grenetina. 

00:00:41.527 --> 00:00:44.991
 And to complement the jam or jam that you like. 

00:00:44.991 --> 00:00:46.379
 Mine is blueberry. 

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:50.826
 The first thing we are going to do is melt the butter in the microwave 

00:00:50.826 --> 00:00:51.844
 at low power. 

00:00:51.844 --> 00:00:53.725
 You can also do it in a saucepan. 

00:00:54.025 --> 00:00:56.728
 Once melted, we reserve and continue with the recipe. 

00:00:57.128 --> 00:00:59.970
 Next we will go to crush the cookies. 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.560
 I'm going to do it in a mincer, but you can also do it 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.239
 with a mortar or a blender. 

00:01:05.982 --> 00:01:07.787
 Once all the cookies have been crushed, 

00:01:08.187 --> 00:01:09.713
 we add the butter 

00:01:11.313 --> 00:01:12.472
 and we mix it well. 

00:01:15.072 --> 00:01:17.855
 Optionally we can add a splash of milk 

00:01:17.855 --> 00:01:19.671
 so that the mixture is more compact. 

00:01:20.071 --> 00:01:21.538
 And we mix again 

00:01:22.951 --> 00:01:25.978
 We already have the mix ready, and we also have ready the mold 

00:01:25.978 --> 00:01:27.408
 in which we are going to make our cake. 

00:01:27.808 --> 00:01:31.558
 It is a mold for removable cakes of 18 cm in diameter. 

00:01:31.858 --> 00:01:34.418
 I bought it on Amazon, and if you want to know the exact model 

00:01:34.418 --> 00:01:38.055
 I'm using it, I'll leave it below in the description in a link. 

00:01:38.455 --> 00:01:41.600
 As you can see I have placed a sulphurous or vegetable paper below 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.855
 so that later it is easier to unmold the cake. 

00:01:44.755 --> 00:01:47.478
 And we are going to start to put the base. 

00:01:48.978 --> 00:01:53.801
 And now with the help of a spoon or hands we are flattening the entire base. 

00:01:57.309 --> 00:02:00.244
 Now the base is ready so we store it in the refrigerator 

00:02:00.244 --> 00:02:01.662
 while we continue with the recipe. 

00:02:02.162 --> 00:02:06.089
 We are going to begin the filling, so before we will put to hydrate 

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:09.643
 the leaves of gelatin, in a bowl of cold water. 

00:02:10.143 --> 00:02:13.805
 In the case that you use neutral gelatine powder or grenetine 

00:02:13.805 --> 00:02:17.452
 you will have to dissolve it before in about 100 ml of cream. 

00:02:17.852 --> 00:02:20.683
 Next we put the cheese in a saucepan. 

00:02:20.983 --> 00:02:22.528
 We add the sugar, 

00:02:24.408 --> 00:02:25.998
 and in my case like I'm going to use 

00:02:26.398 --> 00:02:27.729
 the leaves of gelatin. 

00:02:28.257 --> 00:02:31.506
 I add all the cream, if you are using powder 

00:02:31.906 --> 00:02:34.517
 you have to add only the cream that has left you 

00:02:34.817 --> 00:02:38.447
 of the 100 ml that you have taken to dissolve the gelatin. 

00:02:38.947 --> 00:02:40.903
 And now once we have it all added 

00:02:40.903 --> 00:02:44.634
 we put it on medium heat, and we will move it constantly 

00:02:44.634 --> 00:02:46.488
 until everything is well integrated. 

00:02:52.814 --> 00:02:55.852
 In my case, 10 minutes have passed and it is almost dissolved. 

00:02:56.152 --> 00:02:59.316
 There are only a few cheese cubes that can not be removed. 

00:02:59.516 --> 00:03:03.353
 So we put out the fire, we remove it and we will move on to strain it. 

00:03:03.553 --> 00:03:05.963
 With the help of a strainer, we strain it. 

00:03:11.213 --> 00:03:14.783
 Once cast, we add the gelatine leaves in my case 

00:03:15.283 --> 00:03:16.905
 That we have removed the water. 

00:03:17.105 --> 00:03:20.597
 And in the case that you have dissolved the neutral gelatine powder 

00:03:20.597 --> 00:03:23.530
 in the cream you add it now too, and we mix it well. 

00:03:26.338 --> 00:03:31.005
 Once well integrated, we have removed the base of the refrigerator, and we add it. 

00:03:38.935 --> 00:03:42.903
 Once all the filling is added, we will let it temper at room temperature 

00:03:42.903 --> 00:03:43.902
 for a few minutes. 

00:03:44.502 --> 00:03:47.658
 It has already been tempered, so we put a film and keep it 

00:03:47.658 --> 00:03:50.082
 in the refrigerator a minimum of 6 hours. 

00:03:50.582 --> 00:03:53.931
 In my case, 24 hours have passed and I am going to unmold it. 

00:03:54.731 --> 00:03:57.882
 We have already unmounted the cake, and I have the jam here 

00:03:57.882 --> 00:03:59.356
 what are we going to put on him? 

00:03:59.656 --> 00:04:02.397
 Let's move it well so that it is smooth. 

00:04:03.197 --> 00:04:06.531
 And we went to put the jam on the cake. 

00:04:06.731 --> 00:04:08.311
 The quantity is to taste. 

00:04:13.597 --> 00:04:18.405
 Here you have the cake finished, as you can see it looks amazing. 

00:04:18.405 --> 00:04:21.903
 And if you are not going to eat it at the moment, you should keep it in the refrigerator 

00:04:21.903 --> 00:04:23.116
 Until you go eat it. 

00:04:23.416 --> 00:04:26.740
 Now we are going to cut a piece so you can see how it is inside. 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:30.193
 We have cut a piece and you can see how it is inside. 

00:04:30.493 --> 00:04:32.247
 Here you have a portion. 

00:04:32.547 --> 00:04:35.585
 And you can also see the whole cake without the piece. 

00:04:35.905 --> 00:04:39.085
 Now I'm going to call my mother to see what she thinks of this cake. 

00:04:39.285 --> 00:04:41.222
 # MERY SHOUT: Mom! come and try the cake. 

00:04:41.422 --> 00:04:42.251
 # CARMEN FROM FAR: I'm going, daughter. 

00:04:42.751 --> 00:04:43.854
 -To see how is mom. 

00:04:46.342 --> 00:04:47.242
 CARMEN: Mmmm. 

00:04:49.036 --> 00:04:50.889
 Not rich, delicious. 

00:04:51.661 --> 00:04:54.551
 -Well, since it's here, mom, let's take advantage of it 

00:04:54.551 --> 00:04:57.018
