up the starting position bring the ball

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.790 
up the starting position bring the ball
over<00:00:35.180> have<00:00:36.180> it<00:00:36.329> bounce<00:00:36.600> have<00:00:37.140> this<00:00:37.320> guy<00:00:37.500> stop

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
against the wall it's a load too far off

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.869 
against the wall it's a load too far off

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
guy push the ball you move you rotate

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.720 
guy push the ball you move you rotate
this<00:00:54.539> guy<00:00:54.780> until<00:00:54.960> until<00:00:55.469> his<00:00:55.730> perpendicular

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
this guy until until his perpendicular

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.220 
this guy until until his perpendicular
to<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.969> surface<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.570> now<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:57.870> have<00:00:58.079> your

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
to the surface and now you have your

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.160 
to the surface and now you have your
starting<00:00:58.440> position<00:00:59.690> let's<00:01:00.690> take<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.930> look<00:01:01.079> at

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
starting position let's take a look at

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.290 
starting position let's take a look at
how<00:01:01.260> we<00:01:01.320> execute<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.980> stick<00:01:02.280> line<00:01:02.460> pass<00:01:02.670> let's

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
how we execute the stick line pass let's

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.479 
how we execute the stick line pass let's
go<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.510> our<00:01:03.660> starting<00:01:03.960> position<00:01:04.489> very

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
go to our starting position very

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.130 
go to our starting position very
important<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:05.880> have<00:01:06.000> this<00:01:06.240> guy<00:01:06.450> right<00:01:06.630> next<00:01:07.049> to

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
important to have this guy right next to

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.789 
important to have this guy right next to
the<00:01:07.229> wall<00:01:07.439> I<00:01:08.240> thing<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.360> note<00:01:09.570> is<00:01:09.840> that<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.380> 5rs

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
the wall I thing to note is that the 5rs

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.850 
the wall I thing to note is that the 5rs
already<00:01:11.159> at<00:01:11.250> an<00:01:11.340> angle<00:01:11.760> so<00:01:12.350> when<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.590> movement

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
already at an angle so when the movement

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.580 
already at an angle so when the movement
is<00:01:14.070> started<00:01:14.580> this<00:01:15.030> first<00:01:15.360> guy<00:01:15.570> is<00:01:15.930> going<00:01:16.530> to

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
is started this first guy is going to

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.710 
is started this first guy is going to
require<00:01:16.920> very<00:01:17.310> little<00:01:17.549> backswing<00:01:18.180> in<00:01:18.479> order

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
require very little backswing in order

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.399 
require very little backswing in order
to<00:01:18.780> be<00:01:18.900> able<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.170> hit<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.409> ball<00:01:20.299> so<00:01:21.299> when<00:01:22.290> we

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
to be able to hit the ball so when we

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.590 
to be able to hit the ball so when we
move<00:01:22.650> it<00:01:22.799> this<00:01:23.070> guy<00:01:23.369> comes<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.119> he's<00:01:24.420> gonna

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
move it this guy comes and he's gonna

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.950 
move it this guy comes and he's gonna
he's<00:01:24.900> going<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.110> hit<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.290> ball<00:01:26.630> this<00:01:27.630> is<00:01:27.780> what

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
he's going to hit the ball this is what

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.330 
he's going to hit the ball this is what
it<00:01:28.049> looks<00:01:28.200> like

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.980 

also<00:01:33.340> when<00:01:33.520> doing<00:01:33.550> a<00:01:33.880> stick<00:01:34.120> lame-ass<00:01:34.540> notice

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
also when doing a stick lame-ass notice

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.170 
also when doing a stick lame-ass notice
that<00:01:35.080> the<00:01:35.200> ball<00:01:35.410> moves<00:01:35.680> very<00:01:35.950> low<00:01:36.220> well<00:01:36.970> one

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
that the ball moves very low well one

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.570 
that the ball moves very low well one
way<00:01:37.300> to<00:01:37.330> practice<00:01:37.840> is<00:01:38.080> keep<00:01:38.470> this<00:01:38.920> bar<00:01:39.250> against

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
way to practice is keep this bar against

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.150 
way to practice is keep this bar against
the<00:01:39.880> against<00:01:40.510> the<00:01:40.690> wall<00:01:40.930> and<00:01:41.170> from<00:01:42.040> your

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.160 
the against the wall and from your

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.470 
the against the wall and from your
starting<00:01:42.430> position<00:01:42.790> you<00:01:42.910> should<00:01:43.090> be<00:01:43.210> able<00:01:43.330> to

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:43.480 
starting position you should be able to

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:48.800 
starting position you should be able to
do<00:01:43.690> a<00:01:43.720> pass<00:01:44.020> right<00:01:44.530> inside<00:01:45.070> of<00:01:45.100> the<00:01:45.370> second<00:01:45.790> guy

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
let's get into a starting position the

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.160 
let's get into a starting position the
guy<00:01:56.229> right<00:01:56.470> next<00:01:56.620> to<00:01:56.800> the<00:01:56.890> ball<00:01:57.070> and<00:01:57.810> now<00:01:58.810> what

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
ball towards the wall and it should

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.520

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
you get out of the way the ball is going

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.250 
you get out of the way the ball is going
to<00:02:33.520> move<00:02:33.580> right<00:02:33.790> in<00:02:34.150> front<00:02:34.480> of<00:02:34.600> it<00:02:34.720> and<00:02:34.900> then

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
to move right in front of it and then

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.430 
to move right in front of it and then
this<00:02:35.769> guy<00:02:36.040> can<00:02:36.850> then<00:02:37.060> hit<00:02:37.239> the<00:02:37.360> ball<00:02:37.540> along<00:02:38.260> the

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
this guy can then hit the ball along the

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:52.089 
this guy can then hit the ball along the
wall<00:02:38.820> so
