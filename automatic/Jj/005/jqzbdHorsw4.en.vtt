00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.080
 and hello to you friends Nikita and 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.269
 today we look from minecraft 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.880
 which adds 5 new types of tower 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.610
 3 of which I personally have a distance of 4 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.529
 may throw you or many a 5 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.570
 move obsidian let's 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.490
 look at their craft and to 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.529
 do double and the piston you need 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.650
 put the usual put it on top 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.810
 iron bars and boards you get 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.099
 such a double and a piston to 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.840
 make the country a piston you need 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.090
 do the same thing just below 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.559
 put double later the same thing with 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.770
 the quad piston here we got four 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.020
 the piston and let's all this and I 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.510
 show you how to make gravity piston 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.030
 who can throw you all very 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.920
 just you i put an ordinary piston and 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.730
 on top of it is a block of dynamite and we are you 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.239
 it turns out such 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.760
 gravity piston with a piston which will 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.350
 moving obsidian is much more difficult 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.190
 but because you need two 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.230
 obsidian 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:05.129
 one ingot iron then one film in 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.530
 red dust cobblestone and any boards 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.600
 boards and you get such a super 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.869
 piston well, that super piston 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.390
 let's consider every piston it 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.330
 ordinary piston he understands any 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.369
 items one block up ie it 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.500
 looks like this here it is two on 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:27.689
 piston for 2 blocks fan three for three blocks 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:29.610
 measures a 4 by 4 blocks up and then everything 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.970
 logically let's deal with it now 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:37.520
 gravity piston it can you pop 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:41.070
 items but let's take a block with a stone 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.850
 throw it on the piston activate it 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.820
 and 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.799
 the stone flies up and the same thing you 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.259
 be able to do with yourself ie you 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.960
 get up on the piston itself and activate it 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:55.079
 and you fly up and you can also 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.840
 pop up a blogger with gravel or sand 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:01.860
 let us show you just 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:04.200
 put sand on this piston and he 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.780
 flies only me 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.940
 some kind of bug and it becomes black and 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.560
 it’s not at all clear what you can’t 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.410
 to destroy it in any way 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.260
 and the last piston which can 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.849
 to move the wheat well, it certainly is not 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.590
 its main advantage is 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:22.870
 that guy can't move 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.489
 wheat she immediately breaks his main 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.520
 the advantage is that he can 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:29.739
 move obsidian now you this 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.260
 I will test here the most ordinary 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:34.569
 piston he can not pass a sedan 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.180
 this guy can because he is super 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:39.250
 the piston and with this piston you 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.500
 be able to make yourself super bunkers and 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.540
 place the iron door and put here such 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.160
 here are obsidian who no one at all 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.819
 can break that of course can but it 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:52.299
 will be very very very long and make 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:53.620
 from the bunker house super general this mod 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:56.799
 more suitable for doing 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.790
 what kind of supercar are you at home or 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:01.330
 traps 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.010
 well that's all with you move and if you 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.560
 liked this video then put 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.930
 likes leave comments call 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.530
 friends subscribe with you was no move 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.530
 bye everyone
