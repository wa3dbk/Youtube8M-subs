00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.760
 multiple sclerosis is one of the most asked processes in the mir the 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.710
 professor neurology is very rare that there is not a question about sclerosis 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:15.570
 multiple 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.940
 he tried it very easy to recognize 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.570
 especially the clinic 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.199
 and that therefore they do not have what 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.199
 his people no problem in their study and memorization 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:30.519
 very simple the period of time may have the key to the two main 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:33.519
 to answer any question about him 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.850
 seeing managers and multiple as we have already said to a disease 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.760
 autoimmune property owned by young women or start 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.790
 not frequent minds of 20 and 40 years and x-men most predominant more 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:48.540
 prevalent 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.030
 in women 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.960
 in this disease what is important to recognize is that then the 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.150
 alterations corresponds 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.150
 percent of my limiting box therefore lesson of days 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.820
 no injury to motor neurons as such or cortical neurons 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.330
 and that diaz lesion has to be from the central nervous system 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.500
 there is no lesion of esteban that peripheral 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.770
 because the disease of militants of peripheral thrones of 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:13.990
 the sea guille 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.020
 well well in how upset of the month before were that central we have 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.180
 disorder 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.340
 people motors 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.439
 but motor disorders as was obvious 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.799
 you can only the disorder of the pyramidal way of minimizing the way 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.430
 pyramidal therefore what he wanted in excess injuries 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.480
 first moto in arona with reflection the jumper sagging vicky 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:38.040
 and he answers that he has all the signs of first motor neurons and they tell us a 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.340
 case of a young person who has 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.670
 a motor disorder with loss of what reflected the multiple explosion is not going to 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.130
 be our main diagnosis of course nelly practically 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.610
 I'm going to dismiss it 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.990
 in terms of sensitive disorders we will have any disorders on site 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.800
 possible then we will have possibilities 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.250
 alterations jessica therma of alterations of the cord route to 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.500
 later that are of the most typical 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.990
 where you can see by sight the common vibratory banner but 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.370
 relatively soon 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.090
 you can but de l'hermite for example is in pretty expensive tricio these 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.329
 operations like 

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:14.310
 a kind of electric cramp that occurs 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.230
 when flexing the trunk ecétera cepeda 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.159
 They are also quite typical in the region and multiple 

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:25.499
 the popular hymns and above ocular can come for the minor and that aspires to 

00:02:25.499 --> 00:02:29.069
 that his desire does not merit optical fail to say with the normal fundus 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:32.339
 and where can I see the pupil of marko kump 

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:34.209
 What does it consist of? 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.459
 e not the reflex system photo direct engine and if the reflex little motor 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.359
 agreed for example 

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:43.189
 p the coast mop lye inter nuclear 

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:46.510
 by altering the fascicle length of midnight connect the nuclei 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.750
 of the sector and the third cranial pair 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.020
 and that therefore does not do that when you do not look to the right 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.990
 the sixth park erroneous and functional and therefore the right eye if it looks at you 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.030
 for outside but nevertheless the order is not sent to the third cranial pair by 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.090
 what the left eye does not move that would be the characteristic sign when 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.050
 that does not look to the right the right eye without if it looks for there the 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.030
 left however no pótam offered internal chirping very typical salary when 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.420
 be bilateral very typical of people with multiple sclerosis though 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.339
 he fears although he can also be seen in lupus 

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:22.839
 alteration of cranial nerves is also frequent, for example with 

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:23.920
 shovels and facial 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:30.099
 conagra gtg minal yes no for example cerebeloso es ist inésimas also 

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:32.099
 for example 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:35.979
 Intersex transports sexual disorders also puts city upsets 

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:40.659
 mental illnesses, even those that simulate a psychiatric disorder 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:45.239
 terpel treatment the most important thing to recognize what kind of spu was innovated in 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:46.729
 be present 

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:51.529
 in multiple sclerosis and always remember but days and without achieving 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:54.299
 in this central way never peripheral 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:55.379
 for example 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:59.329
 cele will be eminently cortical as an aphasia such as an apr 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:02.499
 accidentally do not occur in people who give multiple klose 

00:04:02.499 --> 00:04:07.399
 there is also no flaccid paralysis ecétera yes that c box is presented 

00:04:07.399 --> 00:04:09.259
 so in a young person 

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:13.600
 between 40 years with an outbreak of neurological disorder that lasts 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.159
 more than 24 hours remembering certain a picture of one hour two hours 

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:21.400
 we're going to think about something ischemic 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.120
 or in a hysterical equivalent that is drawn pear 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.130
 for 100 more than 24 hours and with episodes that 

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:31.969
 they differ between them for at least a month even if they are only 

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:34.509
 what they said to enter 

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:36.729
 well with this simply say that 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:40.789
 the diagnosis will consist of demonstrating that there are those lesions that are 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:42.159
 of month before 

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:45.599
 p plate that can be well demonstrated by clinical examination 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.970
 either by an MRI or by demonstrating 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:53.039
 and there zones that do not drive goods or are made 

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:56.469
 by a neurophysiological study that goes to the evoked potentials that already 

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:59.770
 possess by cooper the visual the moto-sensitive bear 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.080
 the auditory ecétera c3 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.900
 i the other he achieved another pole in the diagnosis would be to demonstrate 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.650
 the characteristics band orio with a slight and boss in the liquid 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.630
 cerebrospinal pearl other the other diagnostic pillar of these patients 

00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:17.490
 As for the treatment, I can not only treat 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:18.830
 the bud 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.830
 i that outbreak the one that dealing with a drug min 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.070
 cd what what in that immune response especially with corticoids 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.710
 in two and very high and then prevention 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:34.889
 of the two owners that predicted one and a fairly large amount for 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:37.750
 what they are developing now only two are investigating 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:39.730
 but several tone that are the ones that do not work 

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:42.529
 mainly mainly interferon beta 

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:46.459
 summarizing everything you need to know about multiple sclerosis we remember 

00:05:46.459 --> 00:05:49.869
 who believes that an auto immune picture in which they participate especially 

00:05:49.869 --> 00:05:52.680
 lymphocytes against myelin basic protein 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.309
 that autoimmune reaction happens as always depends on 

00:05:56.309 --> 00:06:01.349
 an individual predisposition that is for the h has saved him for that of r2 hyde 

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:04.439
 some infection that are being investigated as possible 

00:06:04.439 --> 00:06:08.520
 said that the way produced and that has some similarity to that marker 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.150
 h gives it a rebound and therefore why this reaction occurs 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.800
 immunological women from 20 to 40 years 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.139
 More frequently 

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:19.530
 as for the clinic are outbreaks of simeone relationship that exists between 

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:24.069
 variant of the process that are neurological box percent of form 

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:27.940
 Chronic in a continuous but most typical of the evolution in outbreaks between 

00:06:27.939 --> 00:06:31.590
 they mentioned here some of the main Totono motor disorders 

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:35.870
 sensory other cerebellar with ataxia alterations of the brainstem of 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:36.819
 cranial nerves 

00:06:36.819 --> 00:06:40.539
 and a variant for example they were clinging to hold and shot 

00:06:40.539 --> 00:06:41.910
 with Persian military 

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:45.669
 la meriti netiga failed the barrel until mop internal legia plan da mort 

00:06:45.669 --> 00:06:50.129
 reviewed before and is what mainly to retain about neurological clinic 

00:06:50.129 --> 00:06:54.419
 as for the diagnosis in the demonstration of the plates 

00:06:54.419 --> 00:06:57.379
 i the analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid therefore resonance 

00:06:57.379 --> 00:06:58.960
 magnetic with each line 

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.249
 evoked potentials 

00:07:00.249 --> 00:07:03.600
 and the demonstration league frob wounded of the bands olive tree conalep 

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:09.180
 circulating min antibodies do not get much use for now but 

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:12.920
 the best for the future yes they have it and as for the treatment of the outbreak 

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.399
 methylprednisolone acth is more 

00:07:15.399 --> 00:07:19.299
 the symptomatic treatment are poor intravenous methylprednisolone as 

00:07:19.299 --> 00:07:20.479
 bud document 

00:07:20.479 --> 00:07:21.290
 and later 

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:25.300
 to try to prevent the emergence of a new outbreak the main drugs 

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:27.000
 that we currently have 

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.480
 interferon beta both one to how one sees the cups on ago acetate 

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:34.790
 glatiramer and the fingolimod that a new home asad drug approved today 

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:37.400
 that by being first line in the maintenance 

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:40.680
 of patients with multiple sclerosis the rest of the treatments 

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:43.830
 as with the myths have thundered with monoclonal antibodies like nataly 

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:45.550
 smoke like him 

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:47.300
 talent sum 13 after another 

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:51.189
 all of this has a somewhat more secondary role and when it is not answered
