00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
for the first you know critical hit that

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.200 
for the first you know critical hit that
he<00:01:40.979> got<00:01:41.159> on<00:01:41.280> me<00:01:41.400> with<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.549> psychic<00:01:41.970> on<00:01:42.090> my

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
he got on me with a psychic on my

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.749 
he got on me with a psychic on my
tyrantrum<00:01:42.770> so<00:01:43.770> I'm<00:01:44.009> actually<00:01:44.189> going<00:01:44.610> to

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
tyrantrum so I'm actually going to

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.520 
tyrantrum so I'm actually going to
pretty<00:01:45.180> much<00:01:45.329> predict<00:01:45.659> him<00:01:45.810> until<00:01:46.110> you<00:01:46.170> go<00:01:46.320> for

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
pretty much predict him until you go for

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.410 
pretty much predict him until you go for
another<00:01:46.619> move<00:01:46.950> other<00:01:47.220> than<00:01:47.460> Aquajet<00:01:48.119> because

another move other than Aquajet because

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.490 
another move other than Aquajet because
obviously<00:01:48.630> he<00:01:48.869> could<00:01:48.990> have<00:01:49.079> killed<00:01:49.200> me<00:01:49.380> with

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500

something else to counter he's meowstic
and<00:02:38.370> right<00:02:38.640> after<00:02:39.000> so<00:02:39.330> that<00:02:39.570> is<00:02:40.200> exactly<00:02:40.500> what

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
and right after so that is exactly what

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.050 
and right after so that is exactly what
happens<00:02:41.010> I'm<00:02:41.130> gonna<00:02:41.310> bring<00:02:41.460> out<00:02:41.610> my<00:02:41.640> medic

he's gonna bring out his butt net right
now<00:03:24.530> which<00:03:25.530> is<00:03:25.560> obviously<00:03:26.160> going<00:03:26.400> to<00:03:26.489> be

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
now which is obviously going to be

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.580 
now which is obviously going to be
smegger<00:03:27.030> evolution<00:03:27.690> and<00:03:27.810> I<00:03:27.900> know<00:03:27.959> that<00:03:28.350> so

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
smegger evolution and I know that so

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:29.720 
smegger evolution and I know that so
that's<00:03:28.680> what<00:03:28.830> I'm<00:03:28.920> gonna<00:03:29.040> get<00:03:29.220> the<00:03:29.370> hell<00:03:29.489> out

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
that's what I'm gonna get the hell out

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.820 
that's what I'm gonna get the hell out
of<00:03:29.760> here<00:03:30.030> there<00:03:30.900> is<00:03:30.989> a<00:03:31.020> big<00:03:31.290> chance<00:03:31.530> of<00:03:31.709> him

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
of here there is a big chance of him

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.170 
of here there is a big chance of him
going<00:03:32.130> for<00:03:32.280> the<00:03:32.340> shadow<00:03:32.580> sneak<00:03:32.730> trying<00:03:33.090> to

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
going for the shadow sneak trying to

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.400 
going for the shadow sneak trying to
take<00:03:33.360> me<00:03:33.510> out<00:03:33.540> that's<00:03:33.870> why<00:03:34.050> I'm<00:03:34.140> going<00:03:34.380> to

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
take me out that's why I'm going to

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:35.810 
take me out that's why I'm going to
switch<00:03:34.620> into<00:03:34.860> my<00:03:34.980> supplements<00:03:35.430> get<00:03:35.700> that

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
switch into my supplements get that

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.540 
switch into my supplements get that
intimidate<00:03:36.420> going<00:03:36.780> on<00:03:36.930> reduce<00:03:37.709> attack<00:03:38.250> and

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
intimidate going on reduce attack and

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.729 
intimidate going on reduce attack and
pretty<00:03:39.150> much<00:03:39.330> allow<00:03:39.570> him<00:03:39.720> to<00:03:39.900> pretty<00:03:40.320> much<00:03:40.440> go

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
pretty much allow him to pretty much go

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.140 
pretty much allow him to pretty much go
for<00:03:40.920> the<00:03:40.980> mega<00:03:41.130> evolution<00:03:41.220> theory<00:03:41.760> which<00:03:42.000> is

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
for the mega evolution theory which is

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.720 
for the mega evolution theory which is
pretty<00:03:42.540> much<00:03:42.660> inevitable<00:03:43.160> he's<00:03:44.160> definitely

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
pretty much inevitable he's definitely

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:45.979 
pretty much inevitable he's definitely
going<00:03:44.850> to<00:03:44.970> go<00:03:45.090> for<00:03:45.239> this<00:03:45.300> shadow<00:03:45.570> sneak<00:03:45.720> that

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
going to go for this shadow sneak that

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.710 
going to go for this shadow sneak that
is<00:03:46.170> what<00:03:46.320> I<00:03:46.350> expected<00:03:47.010> him<00:03:47.790> to<00:03:47.850> do<00:03:48.180> and<00:03:48.450> that<00:03:48.570> is

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
is what I expected him to do and that is

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.390 
is what I expected him to do and that is
pretty<00:03:48.989> much<00:03:49.140> the<00:03:49.200> most<00:03:49.560> logical<00:03:49.769> move<00:03:50.190> that

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
pretty much the most logical move that

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.699 
pretty much the most logical move that
it<00:03:50.489> would<00:03:50.610> go<00:03:50.760> for<00:03:51.030> at<00:03:51.150> this<00:03:51.269> point<00:03:51.570> the<00:03:52.560> sir

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
it would go for at this point the sir

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.740 
it would go for at this point the sir
goes<00:03:52.950> for<00:03:53.190> it<00:03:53.280> and<00:03:53.310> it<00:03:53.820> actually<00:03:54.120> doesn't<00:03:54.540> do

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
goes for it and it actually doesn't do

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.120 
goes for it and it actually doesn't do
that<00:03:54.900> much<00:03:55.080> damage<00:03:55.410> and<00:03:55.680> I<00:03:55.709> was<00:03:55.830> kind<00:03:56.070> of

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
that much damage and I was kind of

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:57.560 
that much damage and I was kind of
surprised<00:03:56.519> because<00:03:56.670> there<00:03:56.940> in<00:03:57.090> the<00:03:57.180> fact<00:03:57.450> that

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
surprised because there in the fact that

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.500 
surprised because there in the fact that
you<00:03:57.870> know<00:03:58.040> make<00:03:59.040> up<00:03:59.190> a<00:03:59.280> net<00:03:59.430> has<00:03:59.610> a<00:03:59.640> pretty<00:04:00.180> high

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
you know make up a net has a pretty high

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.920 
you know make up a net has a pretty high
attack<00:04:00.930> stats<00:04:01.670> not<00:04:02.670> mention<00:04:03.360> like<00:04:03.510> the<00:04:03.660> shadow

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
attack stats not mention like the shadow

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.770 
attack stats not mention like the shadow
sneak<00:04:04.140> is<00:04:04.709> pretty<00:04:04.980> much<00:04:05.070> stat<00:04:05.430> andand<00:04:06.150> you

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
sneak is pretty much stat andand you

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.690 
sneak is pretty much stat andand you
know<00:04:06.870> that<00:04:07.140> I<00:04:07.260> guess<00:04:07.530> that<00:04:07.560> intimidate<00:04:08.459> and

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
know that I guess that intimidate and

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.490 
know that I guess that intimidate and
the<00:04:08.850> book<00:04:09.030> from<00:04:09.330> natural<00:04:09.810> Solomon's<00:04:10.290> like

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
the book from natural Solomon's like

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.410 
the book from natural Solomon's like
that's<00:04:10.709> that's<00:04:10.920> pretty<00:04:11.100> good<00:04:11.400> he<00:04:12.150> took<00:04:12.269> the

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
that's that's pretty good he took the

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.540 
that's that's pretty good he took the
shadow<00:04:12.630> sneak<00:04:12.780> like<00:04:13.200> a<00:04:13.260> monster<00:04:13.709> so<00:04:13.890> what<00:04:14.459> I'm

I mean mega Burnett gets pranksters
will-o'-wisp<00:04:21.060> goes<00:04:21.390> first<00:04:21.720> I<00:04:22.020> knew<00:04:22.500> it<00:04:22.620> was

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
will-o'-wisp goes first I knew it was

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:23.280 
will-o'-wisp goes first I knew it was
about

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.290 
about

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:24.780 
about
to<00:04:23.650> do<00:04:23.800> that<00:04:24.040> that's<00:04:24.280> why<00:04:24.430> I<00:04:24.460> took<00:04:24.580> the

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790 
to do that that's why I took the

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.100 
to do that that's why I took the
opportunity<00:04:24.970> to<00:04:25.330> go<00:04:25.450> for<00:04:25.630> the<00:04:25.690> dragon<00:04:26.020> that's

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
opportunity to go for the dragon that's

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:27.960 
opportunity to go for the dragon that's
pretty<00:04:26.380> much<00:04:26.500> becoming<00:04:26.830> faster<00:04:27.460> than

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
pretty much becoming faster than

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.080 
pretty much becoming faster than
anything<00:04:28.330> else<00:04:28.630> on<00:04:28.840> his<00:04:28.960> team<00:04:29.230> and<00:04:30.090> pretty

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
anything else on his team and pretty

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.960 
anything else on his team and pretty
much<00:04:31.180> be<00:04:31.450> a<00:04:31.480> threat<00:04:32.050> I<00:04:32.320> know<00:04:33.100> he<00:04:33.340> has<00:04:33.490> an<00:04:33.700> apple

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
much be a threat I know he has an apple

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:35.100 
much be a threat I know he has an apple
look<00:04:34.120> and<00:04:34.300> there<00:04:34.390> is<00:04:34.510> a<00:04:34.540> high<00:04:34.720> chance<00:04:34.750> he's

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
look and there is a high chance he's

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:36.990 
look and there is a high chance he's
gonna<00:04:35.200> go<00:04:35.410> out<00:04:35.440> into<00:04:35.860> it<00:04:36.010> because<00:04:36.340> he<00:04:36.520> will

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
gonna go out into it because he will

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.700 
gonna go out into it because he will
definitely<00:04:37.300> be<00:04:37.600> predicting<00:04:38.110> a<00:04:38.170> dragon<00:04:38.530> club

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
definitely be predicting a dragon club

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.560 
definitely be predicting a dragon club
but<00:04:38.920> it<00:04:39.370> doesn't<00:04:39.700> really<00:04:39.850> matter<00:04:40.120> because<00:04:40.300> in

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
but it doesn't really matter because in

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.870 
but it doesn't really matter because in
the<00:04:40.690> end<00:04:40.930> I<00:04:41.200> have<00:04:41.380> that<00:04:41.590> nice<00:04:42.070> fire<00:04:42.520> blast

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
the end I have that nice fire blast

Solomon's<00:05:30.880> Mac<00:05:31.090> speed<00:05:31.360> with<00:05:31.570> Adam<00:05:31.900> and<00:05:32.020> nature

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:32.350 
Solomon's Mac speed with Adam and nature

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:33.960 
Solomon's Mac speed with Adam and nature
or<00:05:32.560> Jolie<00:05:32.920> nature<00:05:33.340> it<00:05:33.430> doesn't<00:05:33.700> matter<00:05:33.850> which

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970 
or Jolie nature it doesn't matter which

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:36.150 
or Jolie nature it doesn't matter which
nature<00:05:34.330> it<00:05:34.450> is<00:05:34.480> after<00:05:35.260> one<00:05:35.500> dragon<00:05:35.800> dance<00:05:36.010> it

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.160 
nature it is after one dragon dance it

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.130 
nature it is after one dragon dance it
actually<00:05:36.490> I<00:05:36.670> guess<00:05:37.060> it<00:05:37.270> actually<00:05:37.630> reaches<00:05:37.960> out

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:38.140 
actually I guess it actually reaches out

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:39.720 
actually I guess it actually reaches out
to<00:05:38.170> four<00:05:38.680> hundred<00:05:38.830> speed<00:05:39.250> or<00:05:39.370> something<00:05:39.640> like

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:39.730 
to four hundred speed or something like

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:41.490 
to four hundred speed or something like
that<00:05:39.790> close<00:05:40.090> to<00:05:40.270> that<00:05:40.450> and<00:05:40.630> that<00:05:40.690> is<00:05:41.260> higher

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 
that close to that and that is higher

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.830 
that close to that and that is higher
than<00:05:41.830> the<00:05:42.100> max<00:05:42.400> speed<00:05:42.700> of<00:05:42.880> a<00:05:43.030> knowing<00:05:43.360> firm<00:05:43.540> so

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 
than the max speed of a knowing firm so

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.630 
than the max speed of a knowing firm so
you<00:05:44.050> don't<00:05:44.230> do<00:05:44.440> that<00:05:44.650> well<00:05:45.280> I<00:05:45.310> guess<00:05:45.400> you

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:45.640 
you don't do that well I guess you

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:49.140 
you don't do that well I guess you
