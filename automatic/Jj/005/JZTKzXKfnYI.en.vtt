00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 - All my name is Rami and welcome to 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.140
 another video this is a gameplay 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:12.540
 of gears of war and mind if you have 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:15.089
 I'm already level 43 and the gameplay that 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.680
 was up yesterday was level 7 is not that there 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.700
 uploaded from yesterday to today 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:23.010
 well 40 at levels almost is not that 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:26.400
 I've taken this duel gameplay for 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.560
 teams because then the other gameplay 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.260
 that I had were a bit boring so 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.810
 since in the previous gameplays that 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.000
 had then I did not move so let's say 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.920
 fast it was slower in the end I do not know 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.750
 chosen this gameplay so for you 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.970
 have more fun, not because I'm going to go 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.890
 faster I have caught the good trick 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.260
 see you there this escapes me gets 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.140
 down the hall that but look now 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.309
 here 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:55.190
 you give to the bigger and surprise surely 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:57.650
 the boy waited for him but good anyway 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.390
 let's talk about the subject I want 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.930
 tell you that it is exactly my 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:05.509
 reviews for mourning for teams 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:07.490
 this way the truth that duel by team 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:10.369
 is the typical vall mode that exists in all 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.560
 the games what happens there is enough 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:14.540
 difference in three hard principles of 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.340
 gears of war 3 with team turn 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.060
 from ghiso william in first let's 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.060
 talk about those differences 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.530
 if I have to say which one I liked the most 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.670
 that which way I liked more I think that 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:30.500
 I would say the gears of war 3 voucher 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:34.520
 massively because because there are respawn 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.920
 ok there is 15 response and what do you mean 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.960
 because it's basically played until 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.840
 until the response is over, 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:45.140
 they end up they do not regenerate anymore they kill you 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.060
 and you do not go out then 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.040
 On the one hand I liked it more in 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.290
 cristóbal 3 because basically that's why 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:55.250
 because you had to have more or less 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:58.670
 Be careful not to worry about not dying 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:01.160
 so as not to harm your team anymore 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.770
 that if they kill you then it takes them away and 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:06.020
 you take a respawn to your team and the 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.759
 it does not really fuck that 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.979
 then you had to be careful and 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:11.930
 besides other things also that I like 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.140
 of cristóbal 3 so duel by 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.760
 kiss of war 3 team is that if you 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.040
 was your last you could do class 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:23.000
 I could do classes that for those who do not 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:25.819
 know you can stay alone and kill 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.860
 more than 13 enemies the truth to me 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:30.170
 I used to do a lot of that in the clashes 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.599
 here in that obviously moment is not 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.989
 can do and I say at the moment because the 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:38.150
 April 2 I think that puts you in the 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.450
 execution mode with two new maps but 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.970
 good 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.000
 so basically I like more than 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.280
 hard for teams in stew which 3 is worth 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.530
 but I'm not saying that even guard call 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.900
 is wrong or good 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.540
 I do not know is that he has his points in favor and 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:58.019
 points against points against it 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:01.170
 which is all very a sac or very madness very 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:04.470
 fast and this to some people them 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:07.380
 You may like it but for me sincerely 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.299
 I do not like it or it is not so much 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.370
 strategy or as much tactics as they had 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:14.190
 seen war 3 and it 's that I remember that in 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.140
 stew parts for example because I know 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.049
 We are defending an area or 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.720
 We defended a boomer responds so that 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:24.390
 so that the other team would not take it and 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.880
 the truth is that here because given that 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.160
 that everything is very fast has given to the 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.200
 map and very big then let's say that 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.510
 forces players to move 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.599
 a lot to find that this is also 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.280
 another negative point because I sometimes in 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:41.160
 some games I have to move 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.960
 very much and even happens to a minute or 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.210
 two that I has come to pass what 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.740
 I'm going even I'm going to sack or I'm going 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:49.240
 running around the map but it's that I do not 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:52.210
 I find no one and if I find it 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:55.900
 Well, it kills my ally or something and I have 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:58.540
 to go back to running a lot for 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:01.270
 find another person another point 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.580
 negative that I see is that the issue of 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:06.070
 colors of the armours I do not think 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:08.620
 It should be at least enduro 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.520
 I even heard that I heard that 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.730
 everything by teams was not going to be 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:15.100
 they were only going to be against 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:19.000
 all but I do not know why I say it is 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:20.920
 a problem or a negative point and that is 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.720
 it is not you but sometimes 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.780
 example they set the skin that I now 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:28.570
 same I wear that it's white, it's white and 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:31.900
 red and in the case of the other team then 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:33.790
 it would be white and blue then for this 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.340
 imagine that the other team also 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:40.150
 carry this skin then it would be white 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.920
 and blue and more or less is that it would be 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.740
 completely equal to mine because 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.660
 because the white color predominates in front 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.630
 to the red color as you can see there are more 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.630
 white than red on my skin and sometimes I 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.250
 I have come to 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:56.670
 he had an enemy next to him and not even 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:58.390
 I shot I've come to take cases not 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:01.600
 surely 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:03.700
 I do not know if it will be used to something but 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.930
 if it's true I think that if there's a 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:10.510
 enemy with white armor it is more 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:13.480
 difficult I think I know if it's from our 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:15.940
 team or the rival team in the case of 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:18.280
 they would have put the locus because I do not know 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.230
 If this problem would exist, I think that 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:23.170
 not because because when doing it, it's cool 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:26.200
 they look like more like more because I do not know about 

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:30.280
 locus not the body of the good other 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:32.470
 negative point I would say maybe it's because 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:35.680
 the time it takes to finish the 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:37.750
 games in this case because the truth is 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.230
 I finished it in seven minutes but I 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:42.790
 walter entered I remember that 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:47.290
 we finished the game because both 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:49.870
 rounds in just 4 4 or 5 minutes but 

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:52.600
 I have to clarify that we played on maps 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:55.720
 well small as rem in down though 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:58.690
 well I also remember that visual 3 a 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:02.290
 game in equal because we take as 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:04.720
 about 43 forty-odd minutes in 

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:05.630
 finish the be about 20 minutes by 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:08.120
 each round 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:11.060
 and the truth that that game was one of 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:13.100
 the best ones and one that I liked 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:16.460
 much is given that kind of starting 

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:18.740
 because in both teams there was 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.870
 great players I think there were great 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:22.940
 Because players are not noticed 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:25.670
 I noticed that in both of the team 

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:27.740
 had to play in every action we did 

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:29.690
 Well, if we were very careful as 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:31.820
 example do not continue to go to assault a 

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:34.610
 area so we always make sure that 

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:37.430
 we went with good weapons or with an ally 

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:40.100
 or I do not know or we keep the position I do not know is 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:42.950
 that you could tell he knew how to play and that they were 

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:45.050
 great players and here in stew 

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:48.110
 walia men as I said at the beginning of 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:50.390
 everything more or less here as it does everything else 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:53.690
 fast because there will be no such 

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:56.120
 of games I think and I do not know so 

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:57.740
 well better is that point the subject of 

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.690
 point of time we will leave it worth 

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:02.900
 as neutral because in that it's worth 3 

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:05.120
 T-shirt is pretty sometimes and I do not know 

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:07.340
 the truth is that the only point in favor 

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:10.880
 I would see him and that is that I see that 

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:12.680
 a lot of people are going to be born though 

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:16.009
 it is also true of what 

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:18.380
 people are going to chase the gun and good 

00:07:16.009 --> 00:07:20.330
 finally people if you want to leave your 

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:21.740
 comment you can leave it this has been 

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:24.580
 everything he does for me and see 

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:24.580
 in another video
