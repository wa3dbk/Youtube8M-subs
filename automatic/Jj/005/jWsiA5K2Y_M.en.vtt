00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 
let's get started I was so excited to

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.029 
let's get started I was so excited to
find<00:00:22.939> these<00:00:23.240> squat<00:00:23.779> mason<00:00:24.349> jars<00:00:24.590> I<00:00:24.740> didn't

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:25.039 
find these squat mason jars I didn't

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:26.859 
find these squat mason jars I didn't
even<00:00:25.189> know<00:00:25.429> they<00:00:25.580> existed<00:00:26.179> they've<00:00:26.660> got<00:00:26.840> a

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:26.869 
even know they existed they've got a

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:29.050 
even know they existed they've got a
really<00:00:27.080> nice<00:00:27.349> wide<00:00:27.710> mouth<00:00:28.099> so<00:00:28.670> you<00:00:28.759> can<00:00:28.939> get

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.060 
really nice wide mouth so you can get

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:30.460 
really nice wide mouth so you can get
your<00:00:29.119> hands<00:00:29.390> in<00:00:29.599> there<00:00:29.689> to<00:00:29.839> get<00:00:29.990> what<00:00:30.140> you<00:00:30.230> need

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470 
your hands in there to get what you need

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:31.960 
your hands in there to get what you need
without<00:00:30.650> having<00:00:30.830> to<00:00:31.189> dump<00:00:31.400> everything<00:00:31.669> out

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:31.970 
without having to dump everything out

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.790 
without having to dump everything out
the<00:00:32.630> only<00:00:32.750> problem<00:00:33.200> is<00:00:33.320> that<00:00:33.380> they<00:00:33.620> have<00:00:33.650> a

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:33.800 
the only problem is that they have a

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.070 
the only problem is that they have a
concave<00:00:34.400> base<00:00:34.760> so<00:00:35.060> they<00:00:35.210> don't<00:00:35.420> stack<00:00:35.810> on<00:00:36.050> top

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:36.080 
concave base so they don't stack on top

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.890 
concave base so they don't stack on top
of<00:00:36.320> each<00:00:36.590> other<00:00:36.890> that's<00:00:37.490> easy<00:00:37.850> to<00:00:38.030> remedy<00:00:38.360> by

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:38.900 
of each other that's easy to remedy by

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.250 
of each other that's easy to remedy by
just<00:00:39.170> gluing<00:00:39.530> a<00:00:39.980> small<00:00:40.850> circle<00:00:41.450> of<00:00:41.600> foam<00:00:41.900> core

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
just gluing a small circle of foam core

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.070 
just gluing a small circle of foam core
just<00:00:42.500> measure<00:00:42.860> the<00:00:43.460> base<00:00:43.730> cut<00:00:44.630> out<00:00:44.780> a<00:00:44.810> circle

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:45.080 
just measure the base cut out a circle

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.290 
just measure the base cut out a circle
doesn't<00:00:45.950> matter<00:00:46.130> if<00:00:46.400> they're<00:00:46.700> foam<00:00:46.910> core<00:00:47.150> is<00:00:47.180> a

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
doesn't matter if they're foam core is a

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.120 
doesn't matter if they're foam core is a
little<00:00:47.510> rough<00:00:47.690> around<00:00:47.780> the<00:00:47.960> edges<00:00:48.130> because

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:49.130 
little rough around the edges because

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:50.890 
little rough around the edges because
you're<00:00:49.250> not<00:00:49.460> going<00:00:49.700> to<00:00:49.790> see<00:00:50.030> it<00:00:50.150> if<00:00:50.540> you're

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:50.900 
you're not going to see it if you're

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.900 
you're not going to see it if you're
going<00:00:51.050> to<00:00:51.140> stack<00:00:51.440> three<00:00:51.800> jars<00:00:52.070> together<00:00:52.580> you

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
going to stack three jars together you

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:54.820 
going to stack three jars together you
only<00:00:53.120> need<00:00:53.420> foam<00:00:53.660> core<00:00:53.930> on<00:00:53.960> two<00:00:54.410> of<00:00:54.530> the<00:00:54.620> jars

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:54.830 
only need foam core on two of the jars

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.680 
only need foam core on two of the jars
you<00:00:54.950> don't<00:00:55.220> need<00:00:55.370> it<00:00:55.520> on<00:00:55.610> the<00:00:55.700> bottom<00:00:56.120> so<00:00:56.540> the

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
you don't need it on the bottom so the

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.720 
you don't need it on the bottom so the
next<00:00:56.900> step<00:00:57.230> is<00:00:57.410> to<00:00:57.530> glue<00:00:57.680> some<00:00:58.070> pretty<00:00:58.280> ribbon

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
next step is to glue some pretty ribbon

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.940 
next step is to glue some pretty ribbon
around<00:00:58.910> the<00:00:59.330> edge<00:00:59.510> so<00:00:59.540> I'm<00:01:00.260> just<00:01:00.560> doing<00:01:00.860> a

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:00.950 
around the edge so I'm just doing a

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.899 
around the edge so I'm just doing a
little<00:01:01.100> bit<00:01:01.550> at<00:01:01.670> a<00:01:01.760> time<00:01:02.830> putting<00:01:03.830> it<00:01:04.010> a<00:01:04.220> little

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
little bit at a time putting it a little

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:08.349 
little bit at a time putting it a little
bit<00:01:05.119> above<00:01:05.420> Center<00:01:06.520> and<00:01:07.520> just<00:01:07.850> running<00:01:08.119> that

00:01:08.349 --> 00:01:08.359 
bit above Center and just running that

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:10.690 
bit above Center and just running that
around<00:01:08.689> adding<00:01:09.530> more<00:01:09.710> glue<00:01:09.920> and<00:01:10.310> going<00:01:10.520> all

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
around adding more glue and going all

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.149 
around adding more glue and going all
the<00:01:10.729> way<00:01:10.909> around<00:01:11.409> while<00:01:12.409> that<00:01:12.619> ribbon<00:01:12.920> is

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
the way around while that ribbon is

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:15.399 
the way around while that ribbon is

side and I'm going to place that in the

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.880 
side and I'm going to place that in the
center<00:02:21.920> of<00:02:22.720> one<00:02:23.720> of<00:02:23.840> these<00:02:23.990> sides<00:02:24.350> of<00:02:24.560> the<00:02:24.620> jars

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
center of one of these sides of the jars

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.860 
center of one of these sides of the jars
the<00:02:25.100> jars<00:02:25.370> actually<00:02:25.910> do<00:02:26.090> have<00:02:26.360> a<00:02:26.390> bit<00:02:26.720> of<00:02:26.810> a

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
the jars actually do have a bit of a

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.560 
the jars actually do have a bit of a
square<00:02:27.320> shape<00:02:27.520> so<00:02:28.520> I'm<00:02:28.760> finding<00:02:29.060> the<00:02:29.330> center

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
square shape so I'm finding the center

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.600 
square shape so I'm finding the center
of<00:02:29.840> one<00:02:30.050> side<00:02:30.380> which<00:02:30.680> also<00:02:30.860> happens<00:02:31.460> to<00:02:31.520> be

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
of one side which also happens to be

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.760 
of one side which also happens to be
right<00:02:31.910> over<00:02:32.240> the<00:02:32.600> intersection<00:02:33.050> of<00:02:33.470> the

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
right over the intersection of the

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.680 
right over the intersection of the
ribbon<00:02:34.130> where<00:02:34.280> it<00:02:34.370> began<00:02:34.640> and<00:02:34.700> ended<00:02:35.060> so

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
ribbon where it began and ended so

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.750 
ribbon where it began and ended so
that'll<00:02:35.930> reinforce<00:02:36.410> that<00:02:36.590> as<00:02:36.770> well<00:02:36.950> so<00:02:37.640> I'm

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
that'll reinforce that as well so I'm

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.340 
that'll reinforce that as well so I'm
just<00:02:37.880> putting<00:02:38.180> that<00:02:38.210> little<00:02:38.330> velcro<00:02:38.870> piece

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
just putting that little velcro piece

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.890 
just putting that little velcro piece
right<00:02:39.590> there<00:02:39.650> so<00:02:40.310> now<00:02:40.340> it's<00:02:40.790> so<00:02:41.030> easy<00:02:41.360> to<00:02:41.540> take

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
right there so now it's so easy to take

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.510 
right there so now it's so easy to take
