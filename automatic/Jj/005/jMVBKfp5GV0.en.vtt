00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
this because it's probably gonna be a

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.940

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
know how I'm gonna do this because there

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.630

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
are no circles in my graph so I gotta

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.600 
are no circles in my graph so I gotta
think<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.329> about<00:01:42.540> that<00:01:43.700> hmm<00:01:45.740> although<00:01:46.740> some

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
think that about that hmm although some

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.210 
think that about that hmm although some
of<00:01:47.640> this<00:01:47.880> Lego<00:01:48.720> stuff<00:01:48.930> isn't<00:01:49.409> circled<00:01:49.890> or

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
of this Lego stuff isn't circled or

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.679 
of this Lego stuff isn't circled or
isn't<00:01:51.119> all<00:01:51.960> blocks<00:01:52.470> that<00:01:53.100> i'm<00:01:53.280> using<00:01:53.310> so<00:01:53.909> it

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
isn't all blocks that i'm using so it

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.109 
isn't all blocks that i'm using so it
doesn't<00:01:55.079> really<00:01:55.200> matter<00:01:55.470> I<00:01:55.860> think<00:01:56.820> that's<00:01:57.000> all

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
doesn't really matter I think that's all
