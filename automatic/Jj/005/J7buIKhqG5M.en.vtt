pickup<00:00:29.490> of<00:00:29.640> dynamic<00:00:30.210> range<00:00:30.390> on<00:00:30.779> it<00:00:30.810> is<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.199> bit

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
pickup of dynamic range on it is a bit

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.060 
pickup of dynamic range on it is a bit

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.430 
and they drop the bass but in a bad way
they<00:02:39.489> drop<00:02:39.700> the<00:02:39.819> bass<00:02:40.000> in<00:02:40.209> a<00:02:40.269> bad<00:02:40.480> way<00:02:40.750> and

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
they drop the bass in a bad way and

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:47.449 
they drop the bass in a bad way and
that's<00:02:42.160> why<00:02:45.299> people<00:02:46.299> just<00:02:46.630> sound<00:02:46.870> different

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
that's why people just sound different

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.900 
that's why people just sound different
over<00:02:48.459> mics<00:02:48.700> and<00:02:49.470> it's<00:02:50.519> getting<00:02:51.519> a<00:02:51.609> microphone

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
over mics and it's getting a microphone

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.210 
over mics and it's getting a microphone
that<00:02:52.450> makes<00:02:52.780> you<00:02:52.930> sound<00:02:53.170> exactly<00:02:53.380> like<00:02:53.769> you<00:02:54.069> do

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
that makes you sound exactly like you do

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:55.530 
that makes you sound exactly like you do
if<00:02:54.489> you<00:02:54.609> were<00:02:54.700> in<00:02:54.790> the<00:02:54.880> same<00:02:55.060> room<00:02:55.120> with<00:02:55.480> the

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
if you were in the same room with the

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.150 
if you were in the same room with the
person<00:02:55.660> in<00:02:55.959> real<00:02:56.109> life

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
person in real life

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.849 
person in real life
those<00:02:57.519> are<00:02:57.700> pretty<00:02:57.910> expensive<00:02:58.319> this<00:02:59.319> headset

00:02:59.849 --> 00:02:59.859 
those are pretty expensive this headset

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:03.240 
those are pretty expensive this headset
was<00:03:00.250> I<00:03:01.120> think<00:03:01.750> three<00:03:01.930> hundred<00:03:02.230> three<00:03:03.220> hundred

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
was I think three hundred three hundred

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.330 
was I think three hundred three hundred
dollars<00:03:03.730> in<00:03:03.970> change<00:03:04.380> so<00:03:05.380> it's<00:03:05.799> up<00:03:05.980> there<00:03:06.190> on

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
dollars in change so it's up there on

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.210 
dollars in change so it's up there on
the<00:03:06.430> price<00:03:06.639> range<00:03:06.940> for<00:03:07.180> sure<00:03:07.680> it<00:03:08.680> is<00:03:08.889> actually

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
the price range for sure it is actually

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.789 
the price range for sure it is actually
a<00:03:09.250> 7.1<00:03:10.120> surround<00:03:11.049> sound<00:03:11.350> headset<00:03:12.660> so<00:03:13.799> that's

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
a 7.1 surround sound headset so that's

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:19.770 
a 7.1 surround sound headset so that's
kind<00:03:15.280> of<00:03:15.370> awesome<00:03:17.910> but<00:03:18.910> other<00:03:19.120> than<00:03:19.299> that<00:03:19.389> I

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
kind of awesome but other than that I

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.440 
kind of awesome but other than that I
I'm<00:03:20.109> really<00:03:20.380> honestly<00:03:21.130> as<00:03:21.549> far<00:03:21.880> as<00:03:22.000> the<00:03:22.150> sound

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
I'm really honestly as far as the sound

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.030 
I'm really honestly as far as the sound
on<00:03:22.720> headsets<00:03:23.139> I<00:03:24.690> I'm<00:03:25.690> not<00:03:26.019> really<00:03:26.319> picky<00:03:26.799> as

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
on headsets I I'm not really picky as

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.199 
on headsets I I'm not really picky as
far<00:03:27.579> as<00:03:27.670> sound<00:03:27.910> quality<00:03:28.450> goes<00:03:29.579> but<00:03:30.579> what<00:03:31.120> I'm

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
far as sound quality goes but what I'm

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.180 
far as sound quality goes but what I'm
looking<00:03:31.510> for<00:03:31.690> is<00:03:31.930> the<00:03:32.290> best<00:03:32.560> possible
