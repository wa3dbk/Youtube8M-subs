engine some Pistons are domed some

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.429 
engine some Pistons are domed some
Pistons<00:00:23.670> are<00:00:23.789> completely<00:00:24.210> flat<00:00:24.359> topped<00:00:24.810> on<00:00:25.380> a

944 to control the compression ratio the

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.740 
944 to control the compression ratio the
head<00:00:29.580> stays<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:30.029> same<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.420> there's<00:00:30.570> a<00:00:30.599> whole

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
head stays the same and there's a whole

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.299 
head stays the same and there's a whole
bunch<00:00:30.900> of<00:00:31.019> different<00:00:31.170> varieties<00:00:31.500> of<00:00:31.769> pistons

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
bunch of different varieties of pistons

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.090 
bunch of different varieties of pistons
this<00:00:33.059> is<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.239> standard<00:00:33.920> normally<00:00:34.920> aspirated

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
this is a standard normally aspirated

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.560 
this is a standard normally aspirated
piston<00:00:36.170> got<00:00:37.170> it's<00:00:37.579> it's<00:00:38.579> depression<00:00:39.000> it's

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
piston got it's it's depression it's

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.299 
piston got it's it's depression it's
about<00:00:39.690> that<00:00:39.840> big<00:00:39.899> but<00:00:40.379> 2<00:00:40.800> inches<00:00:41.010> in<00:00:41.160> diameter

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
about that big but 2 inches in diameter

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.660 
about that big but 2 inches in diameter
or<00:00:41.700> so<00:00:42.020> this<00:00:43.020> is<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.260> high<00:00:43.770> compression<00:00:44.129> piston

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
or so this is a high compression piston

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.779 
or so this is a high compression piston
from<00:00:45.539> 1988<00:00:46.079> this<00:00:46.500> raises<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:46.890> compression<00:00:47.550> I

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
from 1988 this raises the compression I

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.920 
from 1988 this raises the compression I
don't<00:00:48.600> remember<00:00:48.719> exactly<00:00:48.930> what<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:49.440> is<00:00:50.930> nine

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
don't remember exactly what it is nine

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.529 
don't remember exactly what it is nine
and<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.199> half<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.559> one<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:53.730> ten<00:00:53.969> point<00:00:54.239> two<00:00:54.390> to

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
and a half to one to ten point two to

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.540 
and a half to one to ten point two to
one<00:00:54.719> something<00:00:55.110> like<00:00:55.410> that<00:00:55.680> but<00:00:56.219> it's<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.430> much

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
one something like that but it's a much

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.340 
one something like that but it's a much
smaller<00:00:57.000> depression<00:00:57.960> of<00:00:58.050> much<00:00:58.170> smaller

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
smaller depression of much smaller

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.310 
smaller depression of much smaller
opening<00:00:58.980> there<00:00:59.160> and<00:01:00.030> then<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.180> turbo<00:01:00.899> piston

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
opening there and then a turbo piston

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.189 
opening there and then a turbo piston
this<00:01:01.800> one<00:01:01.949> I<00:01:02.039> painted<00:01:02.399> for<00:01:02.460> fun<00:01:02.789> it's<00:01:03.660> it's<00:01:04.049> no

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
this one I painted for fun it's it's no

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.250 
this one I painted for fun it's it's no
longer<00:01:04.350> good<00:01:05.630> it<00:01:06.630> has<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.810> great<00:01:07.080> big

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
longer good it has a great big

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.929 
longer good it has a great big
depression<00:01:07.590> here<00:01:08.040> because<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.340> turbos<00:01:08.700> run

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
depression here because the turbos run

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.000 
depression here because the turbos run
eight<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.360> one<00:01:09.510> compression<00:01:09.869> ratio<00:01:10.470> so<00:01:10.860> the

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
eight to one compression ratio so the

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.090 
eight to one compression ratio so the
bigger<00:01:11.220> bigger<00:01:11.760> pocket<00:01:12.409> allows<00:01:13.409> that<00:01:13.740> and

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
bigger bigger pocket allows that and

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.380 
bigger bigger pocket allows that and
actually<00:01:14.400> this<00:01:14.460> big<00:01:14.640> pocket<00:01:14.880> here

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
actually this big pocket here

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.690 
actually this big pocket here
there's<00:01:15.659> no<00:01:15.810> valve<00:01:16.229> reliefs<00:01:16.619> this<00:01:17.280> particular

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
there's no valve reliefs this particular

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.399 
there's no valve reliefs this particular
piston<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.150> can<00:01:18.270> see<00:01:18.390> some<00:01:18.570> pretty<00:01:18.720> big<00:01:19.020> marks

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
piston you can see some pretty big marks

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.100 
piston you can see some pretty big marks
on<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.280> corners<00:01:20.759> where<00:01:21.119> there<00:01:21.570> was<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:21.720> timing

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
on the corners where there was a timing

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.399 
on the corners where there was a timing
belt<00:01:22.140> failure<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.159> valves<00:01:23.520> did<00:01:23.729> hit<00:01:23.909> the

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
belt failure and the valves did hit the

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:28.130 
belt failure and the valves did hit the
Pistons<00:01:25.409> here<00:01:26.000> anyhow<00:01:27.000> I<00:01:27.240> thought<00:01:27.869> I'd<00:01:27.960> focus

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
Pistons here anyhow I thought I'd focus

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.550 
Pistons here anyhow I thought I'd focus
on<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.590> normal<00:01:29.280> na<00:01:29.610> piston<00:01:30.090> so<00:01:30.960> what<00:01:31.350> I<00:01:31.380> want

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
on the normal na piston so what I want

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.719 
on the normal na piston so what I want
to<00:01:31.619> do<00:01:31.710> is<00:01:31.829> I<00:01:31.890> want<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.040> accurately<00:01:32.490> measure

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
to do is I want to accurately measure

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.170 
to do is I want to accurately measure
the<00:01:33.030> volume<00:01:33.479> that<00:01:33.930> all<00:01:34.079> of<00:01:34.229> this<00:01:34.439> takes<00:01:34.890> up

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
the volume that all of this takes up

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.210 
the volume that all of this takes up
I've<00:01:36.180> got<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.360> few<00:01:36.780> things<00:01:36.960> here<00:01:37.259> one<00:01:37.680> is<00:01:37.829> just<00:01:38.040> a

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
I've got a few things here one is just a

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.730 
I've got a few things here one is just a
plate<00:01:38.820> of<00:01:38.850> plexiglass<00:01:39.570> I've<00:01:40.290> drilled<00:01:40.560> two

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
plate of plexiglass I've drilled two

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.310 
plate of plexiglass I've drilled two
holes<00:01:40.770> in<00:01:41.280> but<00:01:41.939> it's<00:01:42.119> it's<00:01:42.420> about<00:01:42.479> um<00:01:42.840> this<00:01:43.140> one

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
holes in but it's it's about um this one

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.230 
holes in but it's it's about um this one
is<00:01:43.350> three<00:01:43.619> eighths<00:01:43.770> of<00:01:43.860> an<00:01:43.979> inch<00:01:44.009> thick<00:01:44.310> it's

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
is three eighths of an inch thick it's

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.270 
is three eighths of an inch thick it's
so<00:01:46.170> it's<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:46.649> you<00:01:46.860> know<00:01:46.950> it's<00:01:47.070> not<00:01:47.130> too

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
so it's it you know it's not too

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.090 
so it's it you know it's not too
flexible<00:01:47.729> it<00:01:47.820> won't<00:01:47.939> Bend<00:01:48.329> on<00:01:48.509> me<00:01:48.950> and<00:01:49.950> then

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
flexible it won't Bend on me and then

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.620 
flexible it won't Bend on me and then
I've<00:01:50.250> got<00:01:50.430> a<00:01:50.460> syringe<00:01:50.880> here

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
I've got a syringe here

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.399 
I've got a syringe here
that's<00:01:52.079> calibrated<00:01:52.950> in<00:01:53.220> CCS<00:01:54.119> or<00:01:54.840> milliliters

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
that's calibrated in CCS or milliliters

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.819 
that's calibrated in CCS or milliliters
I<00:01:56.310> used<00:01:56.820> windshield<00:01:57.420> washer<00:01:57.659> fluid<00:01:57.829> because

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
I used windshield washer fluid because

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.200 
I used windshield washer fluid because
it's<00:01:58.950> blue<00:01:59.219> I<00:01:59.460> thought<00:01:59.700> it<00:01:59.850> would<00:01:59.939> show<00:02:00.090> up

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
it's blue I thought it would show up

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.569 
it's blue I thought it would show up
well<00:02:00.390> in<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.600> video<00:02:00.840> but<00:02:01.770> water<00:02:02.009> or<00:02:02.250> something

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
well in the video but water or something

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.370 
well in the video but water or something
like<00:02:02.670> that<00:02:02.729> is<00:02:03.000> fine<00:02:03.240> this<00:02:03.780> particular

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
like that is fine this particular

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.440 
like that is fine this particular
syringe<00:02:04.710> has<00:02:04.860> this<00:02:04.979> little<00:02:05.219> tube<00:02:06.090> that<00:02:06.270> comes

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
syringe has this little tube that comes

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.199 
syringe has this little tube that comes
off<00:02:06.659> a<00:02:06.689> twitch<00:02:07.079> which<00:02:07.619> is<00:02:07.740> helpful<00:02:08.069> but<00:02:08.879> I<00:02:08.940> made

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
off a twitch which is helpful but I made

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.000 
off a twitch which is helpful but I made
my<00:02:09.649> plate<00:02:10.649> with<00:02:11.340> two<00:02:11.580> sides<00:02:11.849> hole

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
my plate with two sides hole

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.759 
my plate with two sides hole
a<00:02:13.040> little<00:02:13.670> hole<00:02:13.849> for<00:02:14.150> the<00:02:14.540> tube<00:02:14.750> but<00:02:15.530> then<00:02:15.680> the

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
a little hole for the tube but then the

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:17.559 
a little hole for the tube but then the
big<00:02:15.950> hole<00:02:16.159> I<00:02:16.189> can<00:02:16.400> just<00:02:16.969> stick<00:02:17.150> the<00:02:17.269> end<00:02:17.390> of<00:02:17.480> a

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
big hole I can just stick the end of a

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:20.709 
big hole I can just stick the end of a
syringe<00:02:17.840> in<00:02:17.989> if<00:02:18.140> I<00:02:18.290> didn't<00:02:18.829> have<00:02:19.010> the<00:02:19.159> tube<00:02:19.719> so

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:20.719 
syringe in if I didn't have the tube so

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:22.479 
syringe in if I didn't have the tube so
what<00:02:20.870> we're<00:02:20.989> gonna<00:02:21.049> do<00:02:21.379> is<00:02:21.980> we're<00:02:22.129> gonna<00:02:22.189> put

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
what we're gonna do is we're gonna put

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:27.610 
what we're gonna do is we're gonna put
this<00:02:22.609> plate<00:02:22.939> on<00:02:23.500> the<00:02:24.819> piston<00:02:25.819> and<00:02:26.439> then<00:02:27.439> I'm

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
this plate on the piston and then I'm

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.270 
this plate on the piston and then I'm
going<00:02:27.980> to<00:02:28.510> put<00:02:29.510> you<00:02:30.469> know<00:02:30.560> the<00:02:30.650> water<00:02:30.920> in<00:02:31.159> it

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
going to put you know the water in it

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.360 
going to put you know the water in it
the<00:02:31.519> windshield<00:02:31.879> washer<00:02:32.090> fluid<00:02:32.120> in<00:02:32.510> it<00:02:32.629> and

the windshield washer fluid in it and

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.420 
the windshield washer fluid in it and
see<00:02:34.370> how<00:02:34.879> many<00:02:34.939> cc's<00:02:35.329> it<00:02:35.689> takes<00:02:36.310> because<00:02:37.310> this

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
see how many cc's it takes because this

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.270 
see how many cc's it takes because this
is<00:02:37.549> just<00:02:37.700> a<00:02:37.790> demo<00:02:38.180> I'm<00:02:38.389> just<00:02:38.540> gonna<00:02:38.629> do<00:02:38.810> it<00:02:38.840> dry

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
is just a demo I'm just gonna do it dry

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.319 
is just a demo I'm just gonna do it dry
if<00:02:40.280> you're<00:02:40.489> really<00:02:40.819> trying<00:02:40.969> to<00:02:41.090> get<00:02:41.180> accurate

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:41.329 
if you're really trying to get accurate

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:42.610 
if you're really trying to get accurate
numbers<00:02:41.780> you<00:02:41.870> can<00:02:41.959> take<00:02:42.079> a<00:02:42.109> little<00:02:42.260> of<00:02:42.319> grease

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
numbers you can take a little of grease

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.559 
numbers you can take a little of grease
a<00:02:42.859> little<00:02:43.219> bit<00:02:43.310> of<00:02:43.370> grease<00:02:43.579> on<00:02:43.909> the<00:02:44.060> top<00:02:44.269> of<00:02:44.450> the

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
a little bit of grease on the top of the

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:45.759 
a little bit of grease on the top of the
piston<00:02:44.750> and<00:02:45.049> that'll<00:02:45.230> make<00:02:45.349> sure<00:02:45.530> that<00:02:45.650> it

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
piston and that'll make sure that it

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:48.069 
piston and that'll make sure that it
makes<00:02:45.919> a<00:02:46.099> an<00:02:46.310> airtight<00:02:46.669> seal<00:02:46.970> but<00:02:47.810> for<00:02:47.989> this

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:48.079 
makes a an airtight seal but for this

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:50.500 
makes a an airtight seal but for this
demo<00:02:48.439> I<00:02:48.470> I<00:02:48.769> wasn't<00:02:49.069> going<00:02:49.310> to<00:02:49.370> bother<00:02:49.549> so<00:02:50.480> I

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
demo I I wasn't going to bother so I

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:51.629 
demo I I wasn't going to bother so I
have<00:02:50.689> this<00:02:50.810> filled<00:02:51.019> up<00:02:51.139> with<00:02:51.230> twenty

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:51.639 
have this filled up with twenty

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:54.970 
have this filled up with twenty
milliliters<00:02:52.639> of<00:02:52.879> fluid<00:02:53.299> and<00:02:53.900> as<00:02:54.650> I<00:02:54.769> start

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
milliliters of fluid and as I start

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.429 
milliliters of fluid and as I start
pushing<00:02:55.189> this<00:02:55.459> in<00:02:55.870> it's<00:02:56.870> going<00:02:57.019> to<00:02:57.200> start

00:02:57.429 --> 00:02:57.439 
pushing this in it's going to start

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:00.819 
pushing this in it's going to start
filling<00:02:57.739> up<00:02:58.010> the<00:02:58.310> chamber<00:02:59.090> area<00:02:59.829> hopefully

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:00.829 
filling up the chamber area hopefully

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:06.099 
filling up the chamber area hopefully
that<00:03:01.099> shows<00:03:01.280> up<00:03:01.489> in<00:03:01.609> the<00:03:01.730> video<00:03:05.079> I'm<00:03:06.079> just

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:06.109 
that shows up in the video I'm just

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:07.360 
that shows up in the video I'm just
pushing<00:03:06.379> you<00:03:06.560> to<00:03:06.650> nice<00:03:06.799> and<00:03:06.980> slowly<00:03:07.159> and

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
pushing you to nice and slowly and

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.069 
pushing you to nice and slowly and
gently<00:03:07.549> don't<00:03:08.480> want<00:03:08.599> to<00:03:08.689> go<00:03:08.750> too<00:03:08.870> fast

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:09.079 
gently don't want to go too fast

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:10.300 
gently don't want to go too fast
otherwise<00:03:09.290> it<00:03:09.560> will<00:03:09.620> try<00:03:09.769> to<00:03:09.799> come<00:03:10.040> out<00:03:10.159> the

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
otherwise it will try to come out the

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.520 
otherwise it will try to come out the
top<00:03:10.519> of<00:03:10.700> my<00:03:10.819> little<00:03:11.090> drilled<00:03:11.569> hole<00:03:11.750> you<00:03:12.409> can

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
top of my little drilled hole you can

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.110 
top of my little drilled hole you can
see<00:03:12.680> is<00:03:12.769> starting<00:03:12.889> to<00:03:13.129> fill<00:03:13.310> one<00:03:13.760> of<00:03:13.849> the<00:03:13.939> valve

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
see is starting to fill one of the valve

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:22.930 
see is starting to fill one of the valve
reliefs<00:03:14.480> there<00:03:21.129> and<00:03:22.129> it's<00:03:22.280> turning<00:03:22.699> to<00:03:22.729> fill

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
reliefs there and it's turning to fill

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.729 
reliefs there and it's turning to fill
the<00:03:23.060> other<00:03:23.209> valve<00:03:23.449> relief<00:03:26.319> and<00:03:27.319> we're<00:03:27.470> almost

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
the other valve relief and we're almost

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:31.210 
the other valve relief and we're almost
all<00:03:28.159> the<00:03:28.310> way<00:03:28.430> full<00:03:29.290> all<00:03:30.290> right<00:03:30.560> took<00:03:30.889> them

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
all the way full all right took them

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.929 
all the way full all right took them
there<00:03:31.930> so<00:03:32.930> I<00:03:33.169> can<00:03:34.069> look<00:03:34.159> at<00:03:34.250> my<00:03:34.400> syringe

00:03:34.929 --> 00:03:34.939 
there so I can look at my syringe

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:40.149 
there so I can look at my syringe
it<00:03:35.449> is<00:03:35.689> currently<00:03:36.049> now<00:03:36.290> at<00:03:36.560> eleven<00:03:37.989> CCS<00:03:38.989> so<00:03:39.560> we

00:03:40.149 --> 00:03:40.159 
it is currently now at eleven CCS so we

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:43.390 
it is currently now at eleven CCS so we
went<00:03:40.370> five<00:03:40.579> six<00:03:41.269> seven<00:03:41.689> eight<00:03:41.840> nine<00:03:42.009> so<00:03:43.009> the

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
went five six seven eight nine so the

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.069 
went five six seven eight nine so the
volume<00:03:43.790> of<00:03:44.000> this<00:03:44.750> piston<00:03:45.199> is<00:03:45.290> nine<00:03:45.590> nine<00:03:46.310> CCS

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:47.079 
volume of this piston is nine nine CCS

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:50.159 
volume of this piston is nine nine CCS

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:06.079 
this is 100 millimeters you can figure

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:09.159 
this is 100 millimeters you can figure
out<00:04:06.199> the<00:04:06.680> volume<00:04:07.669> there<00:04:08.090> so<00:04:08.599> it's<00:04:08.750> gonna<00:04:08.900> be

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:09.169 
out the volume there so it's gonna be

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:12.879 
out the volume there so it's gonna be
you<00:04:09.290> know<00:04:09.319> the<00:04:10.659> the<00:04:11.659> circumference<00:04:12.229> which<00:04:12.769> is

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:12.889 
you know the the circumference which is

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:15.849 
you know the the circumference which is
gonna<00:04:13.009> be<00:04:13.220> PI<00:04:13.459> D<00:04:13.519> or<00:04:14.060> you<00:04:14.180> know<00:04:14.299> 100<00:04:14.959> times<00:04:15.229> 3.14

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:15.859 
gonna be PI D or you know 100 times 3.14

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:18.870 
gonna be PI D or you know 100 times 3.14
and<00:04:16.579> then<00:04:17.180> times<00:04:17.389> 1<00:04:17.570> millimeter<00:04:18.019> tall<00:04:18.320> and

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
and then times 1 millimeter tall and

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.230 
and then times 1 millimeter tall and
then<00:04:19.880> you<00:04:20.659> also<00:04:20.840> need<00:04:21.079> to<00:04:21.109> calculate<00:04:21.680> the

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
then you also need to calculate the

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.620 
then you also need to calculate the
size<00:04:24.229> of<00:04:24.500> your<00:04:24.740> of<00:04:25.430> your<00:04:25.580> head<00:04:25.729> chamber<00:04:26.150> which

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
size of your of your head chamber which

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.920 
size of your of your head chamber which
I<00:04:26.960> can<00:04:27.349> move<00:04:27.530> this<00:04:27.770> over<00:04:27.919> a<00:04:28.130> little<00:04:28.280> bit<00:04:28.400> I<00:04:28.930> have

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
I can move this over a little bit I have

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.040 
I can move this over a little bit I have
a<00:04:29.960> head<00:04:30.199> sitting<00:04:30.560> here<00:04:31.690> you<00:04:32.690> know<00:04:32.720> the<00:04:32.900> head

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
a head sitting here you know the head

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.379 
a head sitting here you know the head
chamber<00:04:33.500> you<00:04:34.130> would<00:04:34.250> use<00:04:34.400> the<00:04:34.580> same<00:04:34.610> technique

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:35.389 
chamber you would use the same technique

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:38.320 
chamber you would use the same technique
you<00:04:35.840> use<00:04:36.020> the<00:04:36.169> same<00:04:36.349> plate<00:04:36.680> you<00:04:37.430> just<00:04:37.460> you<00:04:38.210> know

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
you use the same plate you just you know

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.469 
you use the same plate you just you know
clean<00:04:38.720> everything<00:04:39.139> up<00:04:39.340> set<00:04:40.340> it<00:04:40.370> on<00:04:40.580> top<00:04:40.849> of<00:04:41.120> the

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:41.479 
clean everything up set it on top of the

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:44.110 
clean everything up set it on top of the
heads<00:04:42.349> chamber<00:04:42.889> you'd<00:04:43.580> fill<00:04:43.819> it<00:04:43.910> up<00:04:43.970> with

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
heads chamber you'd fill it up with

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.129 
heads chamber you'd fill it up with
fluid<00:04:44.479> and<00:04:45.490> messy<00:04:46.490> see<00:04:46.880> how<00:04:47.000> much<00:04:47.150> it<00:04:47.300> took<00:04:47.509> now

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:48.139 
fluid and messy see how much it took now

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:50.110 
fluid and messy see how much it took now
this<00:04:48.410> would<00:04:48.800> take<00:04:48.979> more<00:04:49.310> than<00:04:49.550> the<00:04:49.699> syringe

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
this would take more than the syringe

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.670 
this would take more than the syringe
holds<00:04:50.569> so<00:04:51.349> my<00:04:51.919> choices<00:04:52.190> would<00:04:52.460> either<00:04:52.610> be<00:04:52.880> to

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
holds so my choices would either be to

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.839 
holds so my choices would either be to

00:04:55.839 --> 00:04:55.849 
you know do it in 20 millimeter

00:04:55.849 --> 00:04:58.120 
you know do it in 20 millimeter
increments<00:04:56.120> until<00:04:56.599> it's<00:04:57.169> completely<00:04:57.800> filled

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.909 
increments until it's completely filled
up<00:04:58.310> or<00:04:58.849> else<00:04:59.120> get<00:04:59.240> a<00:04:59.300> larger<00:04:59.599> syringe<00:04:59.810> and<00:05:00.289> do

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:00.919 
up or else get a larger syringe and do

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:03.520 
up or else get a larger syringe and do
that<00:05:01.630> then<00:05:02.630> you<00:05:02.750> do<00:05:02.870> that<00:05:03.020> and<00:05:03.080> then<00:05:03.259> once<00:05:03.440> you

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:03.530 
that then you do that and then once you

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.520 
that then you do that and then once you
know<00:05:03.590> all<00:05:03.650> your<00:05:03.919> volumes<00:05:04.389> you<00:05:05.389> can<00:05:05.599> easily

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
know all your volumes you can easily

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.290 
know all your volumes you can easily
calculate<00:05:06.889> your<00:05:07.340> your<00:05:07.639> true<00:05:07.880> static

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300 
calculate your your true static

calculate your your true static
compression<00:05:08.840> ratio<00:05:10.720> you<00:05:11.720> know<00:05:11.840> the<00:05:12.340> the<00:05:13.340> way

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
compression ratio you know the the way

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.510 
compression ratio you know the the way
it<00:05:13.520> goes<00:05:14.590> you've<00:05:15.590> got<00:05:15.770> the<00:05:15.889> displacement

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
it goes you've got the displacement

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.230 
it goes you've got the displacement
which<00:05:17.000> is<00:05:17.210> the<00:05:17.630> bore<00:05:17.930> times<00:05:18.770> the<00:05:19.250> stroke<00:05:19.940> right

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
which is the bore times the stroke right

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.170 
which is the bore times the stroke right
that's<00:05:20.449> the<00:05:20.659> piston<00:05:21.199> moving<00:05:21.380> up<00:05:21.590> and<00:05:21.740> down

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:22.180 
that's the piston moving up and down

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.700 
that's the piston moving up and down
when<00:05:23.180> the<00:05:23.330> piston<00:05:23.659> is<00:05:23.750> all<00:05:23.870> the<00:05:23.990> way<00:05:24.139> at<00:05:24.319> top

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 
when the piston is all the way at top

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.730 
when the piston is all the way at top
dead<00:05:24.949> center<00:05:25.419> whatever<00:05:26.419> space<00:05:26.840> is<00:05:27.110> left<00:05:27.409> is

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:27.740 
dead center whatever space is left is

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.830 
dead center whatever space is left is
you<00:05:28.190> know<00:05:28.310> the<00:05:29.500> is<00:05:30.500> it's<00:05:31.070> the<00:05:31.219> ratio<00:05:31.400> between

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 
you know the is it's the ratio between

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.409 
you know the is it's the ratio between
the<00:05:32.840> the<00:05:33.229> bore<00:05:33.440> x<00:05:33.620> stroke<00:05:33.710> plus<00:05:34.550> all<00:05:35.090> these

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:35.419 
the the bore x stroke plus all these

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:38.200 
the the bore x stroke plus all these
extra<00:05:35.750> volumes<00:05:36.139> to<00:05:37.070> just<00:05:37.550> all<00:05:37.699> those<00:05:37.849> extra

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.210 
extra volumes to just all those extra

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:43.719 
extra volumes to just all those extra
volumes<00:05:38.599> so<00:05:39.469> if<00:05:39.800> you<00:05:40.460> start<00:05:40.759> out<00:05:40.880> with<00:05:42.729> 600

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:43.729 
volumes so if you start out with 600

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:47.260 
volumes so if you start out with 600
cc's<00:05:44.180> and<00:05:44.570> it<00:05:45.199> compresses<00:05:45.469> down<00:05:45.889> to<00:05:46.250> 60<00:05:46.789> CCS

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:47.270 
cc's and it compresses down to 60 CCS

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:51.430 
cc's and it compresses down to 60 CCS
that's<00:05:48.080> a<00:05:48.169> 10<00:05:48.380> to<00:05:48.500> 1<00:05:48.530> compression<00:05:48.800> ratio<00:05:50.440> so

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440 
that's a 10 to 1 compression ratio so

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.490 
that's a 10 to 1 compression ratio so
that's<00:05:51.620> that's<00:05:51.889> how<00:05:52.069> they<00:05:52.190> do<00:05:52.250> that
