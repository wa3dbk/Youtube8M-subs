00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
four diamonds but then the last one is

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.380 
four diamonds but then the last one is
the<00:00:33.170> sixth<00:00:33.530> of<00:00:33.649> diamond<00:00:34.010> and<00:00:34.250> it<00:00:34.879> makes<00:00:35.120> just

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
actually see what this does and how this

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.990 
actually see what this does and how this
works<00:01:18.380> is<00:01:18.619> all<00:01:19.009> of<00:01:19.159> these<00:01:19.310> you<00:01:19.460> can<00:01:19.579> just<00:01:19.759> find

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
works is all of these you can just find

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.850 
works is all of these you can just find
in<00:01:20.210> the<00:01:20.299> mind<00:01:20.509> you<00:01:20.750> can<00:01:20.869> go<00:01:21.020> mining<00:01:21.350> and<00:01:21.680> find

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
in the mind you can go mining and find

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.249 
in the mind you can go mining and find
them<00:01:22.040> anywhere<00:01:22.220> and<00:01:22.670> they<00:01:23.360> all<00:01:23.600> just<00:01:23.930> craft

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
them anywhere and they all just craft

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:28.170 
them anywhere and they all just craft
tools<00:01:24.649> and<00:01:25.390> armor<00:01:26.390> the<00:01:26.720> same<00:01:26.930> way<00:01:27.110> as<00:01:27.259> always

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
tools and armor the same way as always

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.450 
tools and armor the same way as always
but<00:01:29.180> they're<00:01:29.960> no<00:01:30.200> better<00:01:30.469> when<00:01:30.829> you<00:01:30.920> craft<00:01:31.189> a

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
but they're no better when you craft a

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.490 
but they're no better when you craft a
pickaxe<00:01:32.000> a<00:01:32.299> green<00:01:32.659> pickaxe<00:01:33.049> and<00:01:33.200> a<00:01:33.320> red

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.920 
pickaxe a green pickaxe and a red
pickaxe<00:01:33.860> and<00:01:34.009> a<00:01:34.130> normal<00:01:34.520> pic<00:01:34.700> x<00:01:34.939> is<00:01:35.180> they're

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
pickaxe and a normal pic x is they're

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.139 
pickaxe and a normal pic x is they're
all<00:01:36.110> the<00:01:36.350> same<00:01:36.430> durability<00:01:37.430> they're<00:01:37.850> all<00:01:38.000> the

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:38.149 
all the same durability they're all the

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:40.480 
all the same durability they're all the
same<00:01:38.180> amount<00:01:39.170> how'd<00:01:39.680> that<00:01:39.799> break<00:01:40.070> anything

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
same amount how'd that break anything

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.030 
same amount how'd that break anything
they're<00:01:41.390> all<00:01:41.570> the<00:01:41.750> same<00:01:41.780> but<00:01:42.530> then<00:01:42.740> there's

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
they're all the same but then there's

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.330 
they're all the same but then there's
the<00:01:43.369> ultra<00:01:44.210> diamond<00:01:44.689> the<00:01:45.380> ultra<00:01:45.740> diamond<00:01:46.130> is

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
the ultra diamond the ultra diamond is

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.779 
the ultra diamond the ultra diamond is
double<00:01:47.299> what<00:01:47.329> the<00:01:47.810> normal<00:01:48.560> diamond<00:01:49.219> stuff<00:01:49.490> and

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:49.789 
double what the normal diamond stuff and

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:52.630 
double what the normal diamond stuff and
all<00:01:49.939> these<00:01:50.119> diamond<00:01:50.659> stuff<00:01:50.899> do<00:01:51.140> so<00:01:51.740> if<00:01:51.950> we<00:01:52.009> to

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
all these diamond stuff do so if we to

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.310 
all these diamond stuff do so if we to

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
them as you can see here mine is kind of

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.960 
them as you can see here mine is kind of
glitch<00:02:56.140> so<00:02:56.530> it<00:02:56.739> does<00:02:56.950> it<00:02:57.190> makes<00:02:57.459> this<00:02:57.640> weird

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
glitch so it does it makes this weird

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.510 
glitch so it does it makes this weird
fire<00:02:58.390> but<00:02:59.050> it<00:02:59.140> sets<00:02:59.380> them<00:02:59.620> on<00:02:59.800> fire<00:02:59.860> if<00:03:00.370> you're

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
fire but it sets them on fire if you're

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.280

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
in water you're kind of screwed but it

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.229 
in water you're kind of screwed but it
sets<00:03:02.500> them<00:03:02.650> on<00:03:02.739> fire<00:03:02.800> and<00:03:03.310> it's<00:03:03.459> incredibly

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.020 
sets them on fire and it's incredibly
good<00:03:04.540> so<00:03:05.080> if<00:03:05.410> you<00:03:05.709> actually<00:03:05.980> get<00:03:06.730> enough
