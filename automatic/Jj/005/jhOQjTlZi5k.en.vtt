00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.530
 you are ready to feel b beautiful 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.869
 today you will discover how with me 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:21.310
 simple to make this look 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.369
 mysterious perfect for a dance in 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.990
 mask 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.330
 after making a face trick 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:31.180
 intense we pass to the most part 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:33.550
 fun and mysterious thanks to this 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:36.430
 template you can against the already made 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.680
 like I did or create it with 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.680
 scissors or if you are 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.420
 very good to draw it freehand on 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:47.370
 the whole face 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.370
 first we wear the mask 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:57.539
 trying to cover if we can 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:01:01.929
 eyebrows and have more eye free 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:04.390
 so we look for the color we like about 

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:08.350
 more in this case we could use a 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:12.670
 purple or black I will apply a black 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:16.870
 let's take glitter of perinelli of bari 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:19.630
 dimensions and we begin to color everyone 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:22.030
 single bookeen and I take the first one 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:25.659
 brush 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:28.960
 I take the color I tap off 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:31.950
 the excesses crush the mask and the 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.950
 use as a stencil 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:47.469
 and after filling in all the spaces 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:51.280
 we remove the mask 

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:53.950
 here we are now going to define each 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:58.539
 single design and then we go to 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:03.789
 draw the mask around in one 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:07.000
 thin black magic from the tip 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:09.420
 hard enough and I'm going to draw everything 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.420
 the edge 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:39.380
 with a cotton swab soaked in 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.380
 I go to define all the edges 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:52.579
 to make your mask 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:56.889
 sparkling applied liner in 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:56.889
 glitter only on some details 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:14.450
 you have seen how simple to realize a 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:16.760
 intriguing and mysterious total look that 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.580
 will make you the protagonist of a party in 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:23.950
 mask because you remember they don't exist 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.950
 ugly women only lazy women 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.220
 no
