00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.780
 remove all the water 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:43.300
 we connect all the water 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.300
 we let it rest a bit 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:50.640
 and this our foundation that we put 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.040
 oil, we're going to put a minute 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.200
 slow fire to warm the 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.130
 oil and then we're going to put the rice 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.130

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:05.970

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.780
 like ham 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:22.740
 and with a spoonful they are moving it 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.740
 every two minutes so it does not burn 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:30.190
 well it is moving us until believing 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.190

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.810
 good while we're recording our 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.050
 rice that lasts a long time because it is already 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:43.340
 At a slow fire we will burn the 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:46.780
 I collect in a blender, we're going to put 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.780

 and we put the onion girl 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:03.450

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.450
 and use them 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.840
 this number and we are going to add all the 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.000
 room 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.050

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.050

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:22.569

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:43.530
 I know I'm going to add this one tooth 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.530
 of garlic to give a little flavor 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:53.790

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:56.269

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:13.769
 be all the expert we add 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:25.230
 and we cover it and leave it for 20 minutes 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.230
 to simmer 

00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:41.939
