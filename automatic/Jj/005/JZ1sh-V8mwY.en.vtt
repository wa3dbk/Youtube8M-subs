00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.070
 of course it was a big mistake 

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:17.619
 the contemplative is torn the Swabians 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:20.619
 but this weekend it is valuable for us 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.419
 Today she tells 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:30.419
 who stay teachers 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.560
 at nine o'clock in the morning it is busy 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.080
 Karas torn to the board 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.710
 in the native Gunners 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.120
 he is the founder of Lorenzen's own buildings the quarter mile from Elchingen lures them 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.120
 all 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.500
 the cars are all reduced to the essentials 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.610
 a steering wheel and of course the extra-dose card 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.180
 This tricked like Formula 1 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.840
 without a tire Behrmann where do you get on when you arrive 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.530
 is going on here 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.210
 that seals everything with the one goal Kommern and record companies 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.560
 Words the competition 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.560
 Ford's Volvo for if wagering that live 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.870
 Markus Mücke the Graubünden 32 biturbo gold 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.040
 his gem managed it from zero to a hundred in 3 com as two seconds 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.340
 with over 500 54 HP probably one of the fastest gold are all Germany 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.140
 Today he starts to sink the competition mentioned 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.740
 since this morning at 3 o'clock he is on the way when the car comes fresh 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:45.910
 features 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.910
 the last few had been voted on whether Otto drugs 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.850
 the maiden voyage 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.980
 A race for the maiden voyage, if that works well, but at least he has to 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.220
 The farmers can not test on the highway but this can be on the 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.510
 Racetrack do exactly the same thing as the inventor 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.530
 or threatens bad luck 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.480
 not completely satisfied 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.420
 That wants 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.540
 4 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.219
 illegal stuff in front of that 

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:13.219
 Obviously more and more people want that 

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:17.399
 thousand euro fine 

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:20.399
 four points in Flensburg 

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:23.149
 he may give against it 

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:26.149
 no matter if Maxim 

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:43.559
 who endangers other flies out 

00:02:45.929 --> 00:02:47.769
 Waldweiler 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:50.769
 there come 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:53.539
 No the whole day 

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:57.579
 Siege condition the airfield Tower over 400 participants want to compete 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:00.579
 for 25 euros a real bargain 

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:03.829
 and finally after 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:06.829
 said Markus Lück and his litogo so far 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:10.329
 Nervousness before the start if everything goes well 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:16.089
 the density jumps to green he gives gas 

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:17.579
 happy with it first gear 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:20.579
 second gear 

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:25.629
 one 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:28.469
 and in the stands is great 

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:31.469
 The circuit turns out to be approx 

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:37.129
 Slowly slowly Markus Lück lets the car roll out 

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:39.659
 you have to stop 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:42.579
 Shaking his head Explaining attempts 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:45.179
 Homburger citizens did not want or do not want 

00:03:45.179 --> 00:03:48.559
 Warner Bros and here still € 000 with amazement 

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:51.779
 the consumers and competitors Volvo ground 

00:03:51.779 --> 00:03:53.859
 twice as many people 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:57.409
 a real fighter is it would be him a second time 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:00.409
 and while luck again to the registration page 

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:03.219
 the second world record 

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:06.819
 not the german swiss but what dranhängen behind drives to the 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:10.429
 World record Hubert Weis Head of the gable knee seen 

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:13.759
 the man is getting a suitcase 

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:18.629
 200 Reinhard Giger over the tarmac at a few viewpoint Tigers as tall as 

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:20.370
 a ruler 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.139
 after all 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:23.330
 At least the shoes have remained whole 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.010
 So from many places to break 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.699
 like those here 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:29.699
 So now they have been charged in court 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.150
 even before 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:32.830
 So very quiet and Allofs 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.199
 So pretty good 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:37.199
 Of course, loyal but it said shortly 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.759
 and the next crazy guy is on the grid 

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:45.319
 With this squad, when to when should the acceleration record be broken 

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:49.240
 all load at almost 200 km / h 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.810
 but also succeeds the quarter mile creates the team in the hall times 15 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:55.309
 Chamber 8 seconds 

00:04:55.309 --> 00:04:57.439
 world Record 

00:04:57.439 --> 00:05:00.439
 Markus Lück also wants to know it again 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.139
 Ralph Kammer 8 seconds faster were only five others that day 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:09.139
 despite the damage to his gulf 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.960
 maybe not feared the special promotion of redevelopment 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:13.550
 had been 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:14.719
 for Olpe 

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:17.880
 before which KrustyBurger carries advertising folders on seals and 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.919
 I hope it does not break that much 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:21.470
 he takes it athletic 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.979
 and who's that long? 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:26.979
 back to Meerbusch in his workshop operational 

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:34.389
 whether wanted or not the Hollywood 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:37.389
 requires besides his um 

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:48.449
 they are in the end
