00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:14.320
 great 

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:19.930
 business idea for manufacturers 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:23.060
 sports simulator 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:26.110
 more people are trying to lead 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:29.420
 healthy lifestyle and rightly so 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:31.750
 many of them even pay a lot of money 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.309
 to a few hours a week 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:37.910
 Engage in beautiful and comfortable 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:41.480
 simulators with few 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.789
 what amount of useful one thinks 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:48.170
 mechanical energy they produce 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:50.859
 and then stupidly lost going into 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:54.829
 friction and heat 

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:56.079
 because each training is hundreds squeezed 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:00.670
 of you kilo jova 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:04.820
 not so little if you look 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.100
 for example an ordinary person working on 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.500
 simulator hands 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.299
 able to develop power up to 100 watts 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.710
 and feet 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:18.560
 over 200 watts and this is at an average pace 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:21.560
 workout and brief 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:26.750
 these indicators can be increased in 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:29.950
 several times I suggest adding to 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:33.289
 simulators generator and connect to it 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:37.180
 batteries for different capacities and 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:41.570
 which stress today produce 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:47.990
 a great many that everyone 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:50.830
 could take my energy and spend 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:54.250
 will fall with benefit 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.250
 think about it
