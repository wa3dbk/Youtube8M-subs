00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 hello everybody knows it below 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.460
 I hope you're good at me 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.509
 it's going nickel and today I'm you 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.849
 propose a small video for you 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.410
 show how to make and use the 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.300
 copies i then you will see there are 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.000
 really no simpler you need 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:19.199
 a page of chains of wood finally normal 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.060
 a stick and make it so that's going gonna 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.930
 consist of making a hook that will 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.210
 very useful 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.189
 finally it's a must-have thing to do 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.580
 the treasure chest then wanted to pose 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.689
 like those see here and it gives two 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.079
 hooks so you take it when we 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.690
 does not need 36 thousand men after 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.530
 you take a normal box so I 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.809
 think everyone knows how to make a 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.910
 safe and wanted to pose like this or 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.550
 put the cof on the right and tick it 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.520
 hook here so that's the trunk at 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:51.059
 pg then once you have your chest 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.079
 trapped you take 8/10 spencer moment 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.789
 I will not take myself but because I 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.620
 am a creative so I do not need 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:01.670
 you dig a hole three by three 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.820
 like these and you get off of two 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.769
 blocks 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.140
 So therefore this is to ask yourself 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.840
 dispensary like this one always needs 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.439
 that the holes are towards the water and at 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.770
 middle you put some red stone here 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.659
 like this so it must give that took 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.500
 once you did that you cover up 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.790
 with one of the blocks you use 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.490
 finally me it's sand so I 'm going 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.990
 put sand so you do not put it 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.000
 retained the red stone and after you put 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.890
 the trunk trap the south is after in 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.049
 the clinics you put tnt 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:41.329
 so I 'm not going to put a lot I 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.329
 will not have to be a one each deploys 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:50.240
 Ben to everyone because it's long to 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:52.250
 play with the lah and win already and a 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.920
 last here so once you have 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:58.030
 put your TNT to cover you until we 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.030
 see only the chest 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.430
 so here is the person who will want 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:08.470
 open the chest 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:11.180
 she'll be suspicious of anything and k metal and 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.980
 when he can not open the chest 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:17.390
 a look we see that your objects or 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.019
 karine is here and that's it and the person 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.390
 is dead 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:22.040
 so as I told you in my video 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.900
 previous it's really very very 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.580
 useful for servers because there is 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.050
 many clutches of people who you 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.360
 steal your coffers and that's really 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.739
 boring what when you have you are 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.580
 broken the ass to find diam's and 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:34.640
 everything is really boring 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.290
 So here is the solution to calm 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.260
 the smart guys who rob you of 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.390
 stuff in the coffers and so that's it 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.340
 that's all I had that to say so 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.860
 here it was a little tutorial rome 12 or 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.170
 in which you show how to create 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.709
 and use the cons protect it here 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.709
 more hazards
