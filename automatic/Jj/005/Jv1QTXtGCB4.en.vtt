00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 hello I had a few tips and 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.870
 tricks for you only volume in the 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.429
 approach you can and I hope you know 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.349
 Not all variants are yet 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.660
 different ones with incitement and one 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.160
 couple with his products i have too 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.859
 I've already tried everything myself 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.350
 and also tested and I think 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.199
 for me all works best and 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.330
 I hope one or the other wants too 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.480
 be helpful to you and then a lot 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.250
 fun with the video 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.610
 in the first variant namely the 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.020
 smooth valley as close and first I can 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.430
 my hair first because otherwise 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.250
 I have no chance at one 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.520
 length and then just the upper one 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.040
 Deck hair from my head and the pull 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.350
 I just go up like national small 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.980
 lure movement as if I were one 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.239
 but do not want to be so tight 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.699
 compete but only a small one 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.989
 bit and there I think more often 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.000
 times in the approach over it with that 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.640
 is strengthened and you see it that way 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.079
 Small waves cause so small curls 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.910
 a bit, but they will go later 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.580
 out again because I would get it out again 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.500
 and the volume at the beginning only 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.299
 remains and I find this variant 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.310
 actually quite good I do that often 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.430
 But I would not recommend it 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.670
 as open because it is still hot and 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.530
 that the hair damages but so off and on 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.540
 sometimes I find her quite good and me 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.229
 think the power is also a very nice one 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.030
 volume and what I want to say something in 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.110
 all variants are actually like that 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.329
 Can the each other a bit 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.840
 build up as you can do it more and more 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.909
 do 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.890
 I make the natural variations 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.810
 Of course it can make it even stronger 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.140
 if you want and I wonder that I am 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:43.740
 always looking to the left in the mirror 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.720
 because yes because I am in the camera 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.170
 I can not see why that's why I'm watching 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.170
 after all 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.170
 62 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.630
 and then we come to the second 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.090
 Variant and it is with the volume 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.860
 brother and sometimes I copy myself 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.180
 my hair at the beginning a bit 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.130
 if I have it a little bit stronger 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.510
 like now but sometimes I leave 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.160
 that too just a little bit of time too 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.290
 save and then I can get one more 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.540
 bit of natural result but it 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:13.670
 Of course it works very well too 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.050
 and then you can do that too if you form 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.360
 a little bit more of the volume of powder 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.150
 take and at the volume should brother 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.310
 who in any case take care of something 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.560
 you do not take too much and first up 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.920
 the palm job because that is very 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.350
 it is sticky and the hair then easy 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.360
 I do not think so nice if you 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.370
 that's just right in the beginning 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.010
 Just ran on the palm of your hand 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.630
 apply and then massage in and me 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.510
 find the result so very nice 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.580
 and then my hair came one more time 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:48.590
 bit through and then it is too 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:50.800
 already finished the third variant knows 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.240
 probably most of you and 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:56.030
 not just my hair upside down 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.350
 down and I reinforce it then 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.810
 Again, I just like that 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.030
 they would be down as well 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.610
 I was completely when I with one and 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.080
 Please come again and dry them 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.050
 also faster and then 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.959
 probably she just stuck and me 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:14.480
 I know you in all directions 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:17.720
 and fill it in all directions 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.900
 simply to increase the volume because 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:23.870
 all the more against your whirlwind and 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.810
 knows the volume of your volume 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.360
 later and I like this variant 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.989
 I really like it a lot 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.989
 often on 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.250
 king 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.010
 eat 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:54.620
 the fourth variant is very common 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.720
 alone but also if I am one of the 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.150
 three others divisible or before 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.350
 just took this volume 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.080
 still to reinforce 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:07.400
 I'm just very strict 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:09.140
 braid and very high up and take one 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.120
 he found relatively thin hair with me 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.430
 just not so funny later 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.740
 delle it, got then that one sees 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.930
 just had in my head and I let 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:19.850
 usually for ten to fifteen minutes 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.920
 inside and then I do my hair 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:24.980
 on them may be familiar with a short 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:27.200
 a little bit so that they do not get too wild 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.460
 confused and that was it then 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:32.180
 also already and I find the result 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:34.790
 really beautiful and blum then stops 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.580
 also relatively long always before 13 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.780
 other variants has therefore taken and 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.580
 I hope the video has you now 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:44.320
 fallen and you could do it all 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.320
 variants and then to the next
