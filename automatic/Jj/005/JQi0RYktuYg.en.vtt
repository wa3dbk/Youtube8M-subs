inside<00:01:54.380> the<00:01:54.590> mouth<00:01:54.979> of<00:01:55.159> the<00:01:55.250> shark<00:01:55.659> clearly<00:01:56.659> I

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
inside the mouth of the shark clearly I

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:58.029 
inside the mouth of the shark clearly I
think<00:01:56.780> it's<00:01:57.110> a<00:01:57.170> small<00:01:57.409> little<00:01:57.619> reference<00:01:57.920> the

00:01:58.029 --> 00:01:58.039 
think it's a small little reference the

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:59.289 
think it's a small little reference the
jaws<00:01:58.280> and<00:01:58.310> the<00:01:58.700> out<00:01:58.850> of<00:01:58.969> your<00:01:59.060> depth

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
achievement they did it once I can

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.800 
achievement they did it once I can
definitely<00:02:01.880> see<00:02:02.030> why<00:02:02.119> they<00:02:02.210> do<00:02:02.390> it<00:02:02.509> again<00:02:02.719> but
