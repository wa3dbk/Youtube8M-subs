I wanted to get rid of chambers so I

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.850 
I wanted to get rid of chambers so I
thought<00:01:08.400> this<00:01:08.520> was<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.700> good<00:01:08.880> week<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.090> do<00:01:09.270> so

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
thought this was a good week to do so

apparently<00:01:10.860> he<00:01:11.040> came<00:01:11.220> close<00:01:11.430> with<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.640> free

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
apparently he came close with a free

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.700 
apparently he came close with a free
kick<00:01:12.000> as<00:01:12.150> well<00:01:12.180> so<00:01:12.720> I'm<00:01:12.840> hoping<00:01:13.200> he<00:01:13.380> gets<00:01:13.409> me

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
kick as well so I'm hoping he gets me

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.010 
kick as well so I'm hoping he gets me
some<00:01:13.890> more<00:01:14.070> points<00:01:14.280> in<00:01:14.490> his<00:01:14.790> second<00:01:15.119> game

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
some more points in his second game

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.810

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:21.609 
quite a lot of those in more recent

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:23.849 
quite a lot of those in more recent
weeks<00:02:22.000> say<00:02:22.750> he's<00:02:22.900> definitely<00:02:23.290> in<00:02:23.380> good<00:02:23.410> form

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:23.859 
weeks say he's definitely in good form

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:26.759 
weeks say he's definitely in good form
at<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:23.980> minute<00:02:24.660> with<00:02:25.660> Everton<00:02:25.989> facing<00:02:26.440> bottom

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
at the minute with Everton facing bottom

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:28.050 
at the minute with Everton facing bottom
of<00:02:26.889> the<00:02:26.980> league<00:02:27.130> fulham<00:02:27.489> at<00:02:27.579> the<00:02:27.670> weekend

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
of the league fulham at the weekend

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.670 
of the league fulham at the weekend
you'd<00:02:28.690> expect<00:02:29.079> them<00:02:29.170> to<00:02:29.260> take<00:02:29.410> the<00:02:29.500> three

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
you'd expect them to take the three

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.740 
you'd expect them to take the three
points<00:02:29.709> and<00:02:30.190> probably<00:02:30.940> score<00:02:31.269> a<00:02:31.299> few<00:02:31.510> goals

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
points and probably score a few goals

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.870 
points and probably score a few goals
and<00:02:32.049> I<00:02:32.530> wouldn't<00:02:32.829> bet<00:02:32.920> against<00:02:33.250> Morales<00:02:33.670> being

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
and I wouldn't bet against Morales being

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.370 
and I wouldn't bet against Morales being
heavily<00:02:34.150> involved<00:02:34.540> in<00:02:34.720> the<00:02:34.810> majority<00:02:35.109> of

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
heavily involved in the majority of

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.830 
heavily involved in the majority of
Everton's<00:02:36.040> attacks<00:02:36.370> so<00:02:37.120> I<00:02:37.150> can<00:02:37.450> see<00:02:37.630> him

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
Everton's attacks so I can see him

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.500 
Everton's attacks so I can see him
scoring<00:02:38.109> well<00:02:38.350> again

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
scoring well again

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.690 
scoring well again
next<00:02:41.510> up<00:02:41.600> is<00:02:41.720> John<00:02:41.959> Terry<00:02:42.430> Chelsea<00:02:43.430> managed

next up is John Terry Chelsea managed
another<00:02:43.910> clean<00:02:44.209> sheet<00:02:44.240> and<00:02:44.690> that<00:02:44.840> impressive

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
another clean sheet and that impressive

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.500 
another clean sheet and that impressive
6<00:02:45.860> know<00:02:46.040> when<00:02:46.250> /<00:02:46.400> oft<00:02:46.700> on<00:02:46.940> last<00:02:47.120> weekend

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
6 know when / oft on last weekend

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.750 
6 know when / oft on last weekend
they're<00:02:48.500> up<00:02:48.650> against<00:02:49.010> crystal<00:02:49.280> palace<00:02:49.340> this

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
they're up against crystal palace this

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.910 
they're up against crystal palace this
weekend<00:02:50.180> and<00:02:50.390> so<00:02:51.020> it<00:02:51.140> could<00:02:51.350> be<00:02:51.380> a<00:02:51.530> game<00:02:51.740> where

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
weekend and so it could be a game where

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.530 
weekend and so it could be a game where
the<00:02:52.040> Chelsea<00:02:52.430> defenders<00:02:52.850> score<00:02:53.090> big<00:02:53.300> once

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
the Chelsea defenders score big once

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.050 
the Chelsea defenders score big once
again<00:02:54.160> police<00:02:55.160> are<00:02:55.370> quite<00:02:55.580> a<00:02:55.610> good<00:02:55.850> side

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
again police are quite a good side

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.360 
again police are quite a good side
defensively<00:02:56.660> at<00:02:56.840> home<00:02:57.020> so<00:02:57.770> I<00:02:57.800> can't<00:02:58.160> see

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
defensively at home so I can't see

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.580 
defensively at home so I can't see
Chelsea<00:02:58.700> scoring<00:02:59.030> too<00:02:59.209> many<00:02:59.319> which<00:03:00.319> means

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
Chelsea scoring too many which means

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.140 
Chelsea scoring too many which means
that<00:03:00.770> there<00:03:00.920> is<00:03:00.950> a<00:03:01.100> higher<00:03:01.430> chance<00:03:01.459> for<00:03:02.090> the

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
that there is a higher chance for the

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.270 
that there is a higher chance for the
defenders<00:03:02.630> to<00:03:02.750> take<00:03:02.900> the<00:03:02.989> bonus<00:03:03.290> points<00:03:03.620> if<00:03:03.739> ad

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
defenders to take the bonus points if ad

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.360 
defenders to take the bonus points if ad

there's<00:03:07.640> always<00:03:07.910> that<00:03:08.060> attacking<00:03:08.360> threat

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
there's always that attacking threat

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.900 
there's always that attacking threat
he's<00:03:09.560> managed<00:03:09.860> three<00:03:10.130> goals<00:03:10.340> so<00:03:10.520> far<00:03:10.550> this

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
he's managed three goals so far this

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.729 
he's managed three goals so far this
season<00:03:11.300> and<00:03:11.330> I<00:03:11.900> think<00:03:12.110> he's<00:03:12.230> got<00:03:12.350> one<00:03:12.500> or<00:03:12.590> two

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
season and I think he's got one or two

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:14.620 
season and I think he's got one or two
more<00:03:12.950> in<00:03:13.100> him<00:03:13.220> so<00:03:13.730> that's<00:03:13.940> why<00:03:14.090> I<00:03:14.120> can<00:03:14.300> see<00:03:14.450> him
