00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:09.780
 Hello everyone in today's video I will 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.630
 show the next makeup on your 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.639
 queries and so our today's makeup 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.250
 there will be time then chocolate shades 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.910
 so I wanted to call him mint 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.910
 cinnamon 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.790
 So as a gas on the subject I use 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.420
 pale pink almost white 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.669
 pencil 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.890
 He is on a gel basis, that is, he is very 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.379
 bold so he is fine to us for 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.270
 This is suitable for all eyelids and 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:43.110
 sure to shade with 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.780
 fingers and so the first shade i 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.239
 I take some chocolate so very dark 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.000
 brown tint and put it in the corner 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.350
 eyes diagonally and a little while 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.350
 feather inside 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.680
 further i take a very pale shade like 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.450
 reminiscent of mint and put it on 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:08.070
 the rest of the century 

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:08.070
 avoiding the inner corner of the eye 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.660
 since the shade seemed to me not very 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.540
 pigmented i take a shade 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:23.260
 a little brighter and put it on top 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.260
 previous 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.390
 in order to achieve a beautiful 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:34.360
 transition from one to the other I take 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:37.380
 purple shade and put it in transition 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.710
 surely sklo live borders 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.710
 tambov 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.150
 then to achieve beautiful shading 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:48.850
 outside corners 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:51.310
 I take two shades of brown a little 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:02:00.250
 departing red with this site changing and 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:02:06.250
 you also shades the crease of the century on the bottom 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:08.200
 eyelid apply a distinct shade then 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.310
 The outer corner is the same above 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.310
 hemp tilak 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.480
 then using light brown 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:21.530
 shade i will shade and put together 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:23.720
 outer corners of the upper and lower eyelids with 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.180
 using a clean fluffy tassel I'll 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.270
 finally do feathering outside 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.520
 boundaries as usual i always do it i 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:35.020
 I apply white matte shadows in the inner 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.020
 eye corners and profile 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.680
 then I want to add some highlights 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:47.159
 using radiant powder and put it under 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:50.569
 eyebrow and a little under the outer corner like 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:50.569

 staining the area at the eyelash growth line 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.370
 so the eyelashes will appear a little thicker 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:14.010
 and then apply a liquid eyeliner and draw 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.010
