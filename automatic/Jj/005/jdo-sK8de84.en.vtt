00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:46.820 
track so then it's more simple and not
as<00:03:46.080> complex

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
as complex

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.770 
as complex
I<00:03:46.860> just<00:03:47.790> basically<00:03:47.970> clicked<00:03:48.540> on<00:03:48.660> the

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
I just basically clicked on the

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.990 
I just basically clicked on the
microphone<00:03:49.140> line<00:03:49.560> in<00:03:49.830> because<00:03:50.070> I<00:03:50.130> have<00:03:50.160> my

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
microphone line in because I have my

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.400 
microphone line in because I have my
headphone<00:03:51.840> and<00:03:52.050> the<00:03:52.710> line<00:03:53.490> in<00:03:53.900> for<00:03:54.900> it<00:03:55.020> so<00:03:55.230> it's

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
headphone and the line in for it so it's

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:56.960 
headphone and the line in for it so it's
all<00:03:55.650> good<00:03:55.920> didn't<00:03:56.280> have<00:03:56.370> to<00:03:56.430> mess<00:03:56.790> with<00:03:56.880> the

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
all good didn't have to mess with the

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.700 
all good didn't have to mess with the
settings<00:03:57.390> there<00:03:57.600> so<00:03:58.260> if<00:03:58.320> you<00:03:58.380> just<00:03:58.530> leave<00:03:58.680> it

00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:58.710 
settings there so if you just leave it

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:01.070 
settings there so if you just leave it
on<00:03:58.860> these<00:03:59.610> two<00:03:59.940> settings<00:04:00.420> here<00:04:00.660> and<00:04:00.690> then<00:04:00.930> make

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
on these two settings here and then make

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.900 
on these two settings here and then make
sure<00:04:01.110> you<00:04:01.290> click<00:04:01.380> that<00:04:01.590> so<00:04:01.800> then<00:04:01.980> it's<00:04:02.550> more

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
sure you click that so then it's more

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.990 
sure you click that so then it's more
easier<00:04:03.360> so<00:04:03.660> it's<00:04:03.780> not<00:04:03.900> as<00:04:04.050> complex<00:04:04.760> you<00:04:05.760> should

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
easier so it's not as complex you should

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.090 
easier so it's not as complex you should
be<00:04:06.090> good<00:04:06.330> to<00:04:06.450> go<00:04:07.220> logo<00:04:08.220> here<00:04:08.490> this<00:04:08.730> is

basically when you do screenshots I have
it<00:05:04.140> on<00:05:04.290> normal<00:05:04.770> because<00:05:05.460> I<00:05:05.550> don't<00:05:05.700> need<00:05:05.820> high

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
it on normal because I don't need high

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.590 
it on normal because I don't need high
quality<00:05:05.970> because<00:05:06.630> my<00:05:06.720> laptops<00:05:07.140> as<00:05:07.290> good<00:05:07.500> as

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:08.600
