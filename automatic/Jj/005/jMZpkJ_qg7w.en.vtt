00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
that shows right there how weak the

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.420 
that shows right there how weak the
grenades<00:03:23.910> are<00:03:24.060> on<00:03:24.150> this<00:03:24.270> game<00:03:24.480> they<00:03:25.430> really

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
grenades are on this game they really

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.650 
grenades are on this game they really
aren't<00:03:26.790> that<00:03:26.940> strong<00:03:27.270> at<00:03:27.540> all<00:03:29.450> right<00:03:30.450> here

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
aren't that strong at all right here

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.920 
aren't that strong at all right here
there's<00:03:31.520> advanced<00:03:32.520> UAV<00:03:32.700> up<00:03:33.000> so<00:03:33.300> I<00:03:33.540> see<00:03:33.750> there's

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
there's advanced UAV up so I see there's

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.860 
there's advanced UAV up so I see there's
a<00:03:33.990> couple<00:03:34.170> over<00:03:34.440> here<00:03:34.940> this<00:03:35.940> guy<00:03:36.210> what<00:03:36.780> he's

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
a couple over here this guy what he's

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.350 
a couple over here this guy what he's
doing<00:03:37.200> gets<00:03:37.920> turned<00:03:38.220> on<00:03:38.400> though<00:03:39.200> and<00:03:40.670> here<00:03:41.670> get

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
doing gets turned on though and here get

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.660 
doing gets turned on though and here get
one<00:03:42.570> guy<00:03:42.780> and<00:03:43.709> then<00:03:43.890> I<00:03:43.920> think<00:03:44.310> there's<00:03:44.490> more

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
one guy and then I think there's more

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:45.949 
one guy and then I think there's more
over<00:03:44.820> there<00:03:45.030> so<00:03:45.240> that's<00:03:45.360> why<00:03:45.540> I'm<00:03:45.660> waiting

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
over there so that's why I'm waiting

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
right now and then actually it's kind of

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.050 
right now and then actually it's kind of
funny<00:03:48.720> way<00:03:48.870> to<00:03:48.900> do<00:03:49.110> here<00:03:49.350> I<00:03:49.560> with<00:03:50.459> my<00:03:50.580> teammate

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
funny way to do here I with my teammate

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.810 
funny way to do here I with my teammate
go<00:03:51.330> right<00:03:51.540> in<00:03:51.690> front<00:03:51.870> of<00:03:51.930> me<00:03:52.100> Batum<00:03:53.100> he's<00:03:53.550> my
