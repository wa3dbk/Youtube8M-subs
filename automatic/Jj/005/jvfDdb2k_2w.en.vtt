I<00:00:46.790> had<00:00:46.910> to<00:00:46.940> buy<00:00:47.149> more<00:00:47.390> jazz<00:00:47.690> three<00:00:47.960> picks<00:00:48.230> at

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:49.040

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.000 
I had to buy more jazz three picks at
the<00:00:49.100> red<00:00:49.340> nylon<00:00:49.579> the<00:00:50.149> black<00:00:50.420> more<00:00:51.140> red<00:00:51.440> even

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
the red nylon the black more red even

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.010 
the red nylon the black more red even
tried<00:00:52.219> the<00:00:52.370> XL<00:00:52.730> series<00:00:53.149> but<00:00:53.690> the<00:00:53.750> problem<00:00:53.989> I

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
tried the XL series but the problem I

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.540 
tried the XL series but the problem I
had<00:00:54.140> with<00:00:54.230> the<00:00:54.350> Jazz<00:00:54.559> three<00:00:54.829> picks<00:00:55.100> is<00:00:55.340> that

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
had with the Jazz three picks is that

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.340 
had with the Jazz three picks is that
there's<00:00:55.730> hardly<00:00:55.969> any<00:00:56.239> grip<00:00:56.629> on<00:00:56.870> these<00:00:57.079> things

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
there's hardly any grip on these things

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.830 
there's hardly any grip on these things
so<00:00:58.160> they<00:00:58.250> always<00:00:58.550> slip<00:00:58.879> but<00:00:59.480> I<00:00:59.510> couldn't<00:00:59.780> go

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
so they always slip but I couldn't go

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.360 
so they always slip but I couldn't go
back<00:00:59.960> to<00:01:00.020> using<00:01:00.230> regular<00:01:00.770> pick<00:01:01.010> because<00:01:01.280> I

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
back to using regular pick because I

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:02.860 
back to using regular pick because I
just<00:01:01.579> didn't<00:01:01.820> feel<00:01:02.000> right<00:01:02.090> so<00:01:02.480> then<00:01:02.600> I<00:01:02.629> found

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
just didn't feel right so then I found

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.600 
just didn't feel right so then I found
out<00:01:03.050> they<00:01:03.140> made<00:01:03.289> an<00:01:03.410> old<00:01:03.559> text<00:01:03.950> version<00:01:04.309> of<00:01:04.460> the

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610

jazz<00:01:04.879> throw<00:01:05.149> of<00:01:05.330> course<00:01:05.539> I<00:01:05.630> picked<00:01:05.810> that<00:01:05.990> up<00:01:06.050> it

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530

was<00:01:06.619> a<00:01:06.680> little<00:01:06.830> better<00:01:07.039> but<00:01:07.160> I<00:01:07.250> didn't<00:01:07.520> like

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640

the<00:01:07.789> feel<00:01:08.000> I<00:01:08.030> didn't<00:01:08.330> like<00:01:08.420> the<00:01:08.539> way<00:01:08.660> it<00:01:08.930> felt

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
the feel I didn't like the way it felt

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.139 
the feel I didn't like the way it felt
against<00:01:09.710> the<00:01:09.860> strings<00:01:10.220> and<00:01:10.700> I<00:01:10.820> ended<00:01:11.000> up

00:01:11.139 --> 00:01:11.149 
against the strings and I ended up

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:13.570 
against the strings and I ended up
settling<00:01:11.479> on<00:01:11.720> the<00:01:11.930> Eric<00:01:12.259> Johnson<00:01:12.590> Jazz<00:01:13.280> three

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580

00:01:16.059 --> 00:01:16.069 
pick I liked the way they felt like the

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:17.440 
pick I liked the way they felt like the
way<00:01:16.190> the<00:01:16.310> attack<00:01:16.580> was<00:01:16.789> I<00:01:16.819> like<00:01:17.060> this<00:01:17.240> nice

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
way the attack was I like this nice

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.059 
way the attack was I like this nice
sharp<00:01:17.750> point<00:01:17.959> but<00:01:18.410> of<00:01:18.500> course<00:01:18.709> the<00:01:18.860> problem

00:01:19.059 --> 00:01:19.069 
sharp point but of course the problem

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:21.100 
sharp point but of course the problem
was<00:01:19.369> they<00:01:19.700> still<00:01:19.970> slit<00:01:20.240> so<00:01:20.479> I<00:01:20.539> started<00:01:20.810> cutting

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
was they still slit so I started cutting

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.380 
was they still slit so I started cutting
my<00:01:21.319> picks<00:01:21.649> the<00:01:22.100> razor<00:01:22.310> blade<00:01:22.670> and<00:01:22.850> then<00:01:23.119> using

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
my picks the razor blade and then using

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:24.880 
my picks the razor blade and then using
a<00:01:23.450> lighter<00:01:23.690> to<00:01:23.899> burn<00:01:24.200> them<00:01:24.349> just<00:01:24.590> a<00:01:24.649> little<00:01:24.679> bit

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
a lighter to burn them just a little bit

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.800 
a lighter to burn them just a little bit
to<00:01:25.160> get<00:01:25.310> that<00:01:25.369> grip<00:01:25.819> and<00:01:26.060> I've<00:01:26.390> used<00:01:26.599> those

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
to get that grip and I've used those

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.570 
to get that grip and I've used those
picks<00:01:27.050> for<00:01:27.200> a<00:01:27.229> very<00:01:27.500> long<00:01:27.709> time<00:01:27.740> then<00:01:28.340> about<00:01:28.520> a
