00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.490
 we have gained space we are in other spaces like 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.350
 the workers have given for contraband carme ruscalleda to know now as 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:25.769
 a disorder 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.769
 from the kitchen you always knew that it was going to end here 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:32.539
 Well, no, the truth is that there has not been a story that often 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.780
 my dignity no city astronomy doubt gastronomy was almost an accident 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.880
 I was already working with my husband and my parents in an earth shop 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.510
 has special in a delicatessen shop 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.260
 It was a supermarket format but our 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.289
 of its main product we aspire elaborated meat 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.339
 and her takeaway he already denies the selection of cheeses that 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:58.609
 in a town that at that time was 2 thousand inhabitants we already had a 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:02.239
 offer of more than 50 cheeses - import sauces also from 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:03.100
 import 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.750
 the takeaway recoloque rate of fresh pasta every day a different 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.500
 The headquarters summit also cooked every day a different 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.390
 and there the idea came 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.420
 to create a dining space in this store, that is, what we only need 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.470
 we had another 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.160
 in mind create was a store with a dining room 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.380
 and that he urged cost later in life he put us in our hands the 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.140
 opportunity to buy some state be in front of the store the hostel where 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.900
 we are scared zampado 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.780
 where they were valid to acquire the same property 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.020
 that the works of making dining naturally cooking facilities 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.570
 to create that space of on of tables 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.540
 in the shop 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.250
 personally even the family and we saw that it was much more 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.750
 there is sure to bet on a property before work on the house and we 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:53.670
 we throw 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.170
 there the purchase of dung 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.509
 with the idea of ​​offering the same letter that we had thought of a store 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.810
 dishes that were protests that just cheeses that just reasons but case 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.340
 clear the house eurostar that the space 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.430
 it would be a sea 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.060
 the client needed the letter to be in accordance with the landscape 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.779
 I saw 

00:02:12.779 --> 00:02:14.850
 we did not plan to work 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.400
 no marine product sogorb has finished what we work in the 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.930
 store 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.959
 and here we were clearly opened a world of possibilities 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.350
 what else have we taken advantage of 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.320
 and ecuador one hundred 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.660
 the continent and a shrimp a hake an anglerfish 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.610
 and now that presence is much greater than him 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.690
 the meat space that was the world where we came from for centuries 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.370
 the work the kitchen falls on the women but on the other hand the gastronomy 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.399
 been eminently masculine why you think it has been like this 

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:47.799
 I believe that he sent to gastronomy or the professional kitchen towards been hands of 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:48.310
 man 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.960
 it is mainly by juno schedule 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.160
 tremendous that is still we are 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.900
 working with those endless schedules but mainly for the 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.469
 male strength that he deserved 

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:02.810
 in addition to taking into account that when we enter this house the kitchen that 

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:06.029
 there was nothing in the coffin that had worked first with wood with 

00:03:06.029 --> 00:03:06.659
 carbon 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:07.440
 with fire 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.780
 that means that there was with a sheet a palapa some drums 

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:14.630
 we tried ovens were huge backs that 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:19.810
 a woman villegas could not a few young pots of 50 liters by hand 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.699
 and today we have some commands instead, while we can choose 

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:27.420
 the temperature simply charge the energy that the energy 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:28.970
 day case there was electricity 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.970
 we only get to shoot shootings that are manufactured today 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.319
 internationally to that a measure 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:36.889
 to the size of a woman 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:40.080
 children or not being naturally knowingly saizar 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.020
 there is a living room 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.750
 and the kettles continue to make 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.510
 they will be reductions from 50 liters 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.789
 but they are already Basque before and crank 

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:53.509
 therefore be moved that force that limited us and the kitchen claims therefore 

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:56.300
 naturally ideas will work 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:57.700
 but no longer force 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.319
 and is open to the woman and beyond the physical the fact of being 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:02.989
 woman another more difficult position 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:07.089
 I do not think that one as difficult as a man is difficult for everything 

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:07.719
 the world 

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:10.719
 he must never face a clearly masculine world 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:15.899
 with that conviction that she will bring the same thing that they have 

00:04:15.899 --> 00:04:17.400
 more than 2000 qualities 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.299
 I have never felt unequal conditions 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:21.530
 and I think that is 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.819
 and I think a good attribute for a woman is terrible when a woman raises 

00:04:25.819 --> 00:04:26.599
 what a thousand 

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:30.479
 what will they think they recognize as a menhir they will do then you can not 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:31.370
 one more 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.180
 what do you do a profession clearly masculine but colón feminine vision 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.120
 we know to take in January instead of a better world cook better 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.540
 career 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.120
 I could not be because it is not that never and a very clear thing look 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.100
 are from ekin it's a look at the catering schools are full post 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.670
 girls who have freely chosen this profession is something that this profession 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:56.919
 claim vegas that are there of their own will and they will dedicate their 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:01.200
 life therefore we are going to allocate that balance of masculinity such a good one 

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:05.060
 parity has not cost us for the creative kitchen stop it 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.120
 another of the affairs of state 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.930
 being something more conventional 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:14.089
 start from this this approach to a take-away food store 

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:15.520
 therefore of the pot 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.099
 he counted a shrimp the plancha and a while to the plate and where it brushes the iron 

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:23.030
 and the dishes the cannons the tricantinos the cod with inah sauce 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.379
 and it was mainly about reasons 

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:29.800
 but I realize that obstruct you love you more than the client has 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.709
 excites the first visitors with the first suspects and what he wants with 

00:05:33.709 --> 00:05:34.280
 it 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.750
 a different game who are garments that make you disgusting couples that you have not tried 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:39.289
 again 

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:40.509
 but that you like 

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:45.430
 i by sexes and that point gas that there were clients what to expect and you put 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:49.500
 in them and alec you add an abundant stay every season in the same place 

00:05:49.499 --> 00:05:51.809
 therefore we have the same products 

00:05:51.809 --> 00:05:53.860
 but there is a study 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:58.689
 and a job to make it different and this leads you to do it because it has been created 

00:05:58.689 --> 00:06:01.689
 own style 

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:08.549
 there was not that guest at the table when I was little 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.139
 you have to add television that is now in total 102 dollars 

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:14.070
 therefore at the table they talked about for life 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:17.440
 although no food mainly to check how the product
