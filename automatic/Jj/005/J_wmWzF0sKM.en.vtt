enter into a corner it firms up just
like<00:01:02.330> a<00:01:02.390> racing<00:01:02.840> car

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.050 
as you can see you can drive around the

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.260 
as you can see you can drive around the
entire<00:01:19.380> circuit<00:01:20.010> without<00:01:20.159> taking<00:01:20.909> your<00:01:21.060> hands

now<00:01:39.439> let's<00:01:39.619> try<00:01:39.860> the<00:01:39.920> cars<00:01:40.250> attitude<00:01:41.000> in<00:01:41.180> the

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
now let's try the cars attitude in the

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:53.950 
now let's try the cars attitude in the
curves<00:01:44.380> notable<00:01:45.380> lateral<00:01:45.770> acceleration

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960
