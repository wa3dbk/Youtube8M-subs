00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.610
 the arbitration trio captained by Manuel 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:10.500
 díaz vega of the championship we leave 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.500
 for us the next game that 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.500
 is this 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.500
 yes 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:29.780
 raimundo saporta corner 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:31.460
 the amazing thing when considering these 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:34.599
 two teams of goal averaje scheme the 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.599
 rating the burden 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.090
 of the possibility 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.870
 they told us about commenting on the game 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.850
 assimilate a little 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:51.699
 time 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.699
 now with a clearer idea about 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.870
 and lack of attention to this lack raúl 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:04.030
 García de Ezazara must be explained 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:07.750
 effectively the goalkeeper or the 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:10.240
 referee understands that the goalkeeper kept 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.170
 the ball in his hands throws him to the ground and 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.860
 he picks it up again 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.600
 that's why when a captain invites you 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.240
 indirect free 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.880
 free indirect yellow hill besides 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.680
 for rock and we see the repeated action 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.860
 we have the play repeated once more 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:32.480
 is that it was previously seen as the 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.480
 caught with the marks 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.700
 with the players 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:42.130
 placing the barrier breaks and is not 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.130
 Alicante are disputed 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:51.350
 although Falcap is fine 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:54.220
 does not loose as if it were a play of 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.220
 volleyball 6 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.189
 but 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.830
 with the per word 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.890
 if not 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.890
 i 

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.670
 Y 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.900
 correct one on the part of the of 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.730
 popular 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.730
 he could not control morientes 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.290
 Perfect drawing never accepts the moment 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.790
 at the zero entry when almost 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.790
 causes the environment 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.470
 because it happens that too much 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.470
 land is too much possessions of things 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.230
 when the dog maron 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.020
 and 7% 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.400
 in your goal 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.790
 and to launch the movement of the three 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.790
 points 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:59.150
 you think it wise because to treat it sr 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.580
 around brito arceo let's see in 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.120
 how much ending in the referee of 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.120
 match
