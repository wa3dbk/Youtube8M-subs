start off with this map and you just go

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.429 
start off with this map and you just go
to<00:00:25.140> round<00:00:25.380> one<00:00:25.710> so<00:00:26.609> um<00:00:26.849> you're<00:00:27.599> basically<00:00:28.140> just

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
surprised when I first started playing

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.340
