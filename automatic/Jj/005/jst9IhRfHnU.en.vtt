 Boys, papuchas, these cream potatoes are going to love them. They are some potatoes with cream 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:44.320
 gratins super easy to make that they will not forget them anymore. With a milanga 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:55.370
 these cream potatoes are great. Ingredients: potatoes, cream, cream, garlic, cheese. 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:05.560
 The first thing you are going to do is cut the potatoes and wash them in slices of 1 cm. more or less, 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:15.990
 neither too thick nor too thin. Then you put butter in a baking dish 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:30.289
 and rub the garlic down the bottom of the fountain. You put the potatoes like in a merry-go-round. 

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:43.719
 Now you are going to mix the cream, the cream cheese. The cheese if you want what you can avoid 

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:54.069
 in these potatoes with cream au gratin or potatoes with cream, but I like it a lot. 

00:01:54.069 --> 00:02:19.129
 Now you throw over the potatoes to the cream the cream of milk and on top it puts a 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:29.950
 little cheese. You take it to medium oven until it is well 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:50.840
 crispy golden 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:03:01.670
 Say I want to eat it now. Then look how it is, it's soft, creamy, 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:09.770
 the cream potatoes are made. This bit I eat it. 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:31.709
 How delicious are these potatoes to the cream, but they liked it as much as I did.
