 there now I'm going to look 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:17.320
 now so I'm going to look at what 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.320
 are the graphics there we go that ball 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.660

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.110
 fabregas 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:34.190
 good good good an improved that the 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:34.190
 bazofia but good since there is 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:41.450

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.480
 hummels up 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.170
 it's not that it's anything else 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:56.930
 world and what 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:00.459
 I think the summary is that I have lost 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.459
 a coin game but good 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.069
 well there is no no bad thing 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.510
 there was something out there, but well 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.480
 they put everything very fast and good 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.490
 I still have bad luck with the envelopes 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.099
 despite the fact that a player has touched me 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:37.680
 improved equal to the 200,000 that I 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:37.680
 enough I will recover as 35 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:45.070
 25 well but good you have to try it there 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.330
 to try the ones that have more luck 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:48.330
 that I walk until later
