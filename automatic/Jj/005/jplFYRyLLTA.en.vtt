00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.340 

in<00:00:21.560> the<00:00:22.560> last<00:00:22.830> video<00:00:23.250> we<00:00:24.000> worked<00:00:24.390> with<00:00:24.840> the

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
in the last video we worked with the

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.840 
in the last video we worked with the
line<00:00:25.770> command<00:00:26.550> okay<00:00:27.480> so<00:00:27.540> when<00:00:28.020> we<00:00:28.140> use<00:00:28.350> a<00:00:28.380> line

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:28.850 
line command okay so when we use a line

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:35.570 
line command okay so when we use a line
when<00:00:29.850> we<00:00:29.880> click<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:32.210> click<00:00:33.210> again<00:00:34.400> we<00:00:35.400> can

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:35.580 
when we click and click again we can

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.780 
when we click and click again we can
create<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.880> chaining<00:00:36.480> effect<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.340> we<00:00:38.340> can<00:00:38.489> end

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
create a chaining effect and we can end

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.250 
create a chaining effect and we can end
it<00:00:39.000> by<00:00:39.239> hitting<00:00:39.480> Enter

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
it by hitting Enter

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.189 
it by hitting Enter
ok<00:00:40.890> so<00:00:40.950> we've<00:00:41.550> created<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:42.330> long<00:00:42.809> line<00:00:43.170> here

00:00:43.189 --> 00:00:43.199 
ok so we've created a long line here

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:45.229 
ok so we've created a long line here
that<00:00:43.770> twists<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.400> turns<00:00:44.520> in<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:44.790> few<00:00:44.970> different

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
that twists and turns in a few different

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.750 
that twists and turns in a few different
directions<00:00:45.750> so<00:00:45.989> it's<00:00:46.440> simple<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.920> do<00:00:47.190> at<00:00:47.520> these

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
directions so it's simple to do at these

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.670 
directions so it's simple to do at these
90-degree<00:00:48.270> angles<00:00:48.690> because<00:00:48.989> at<00:00:49.470> the<00:00:49.559> bottom

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
90-degree angles because at the bottom

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.229 
90-degree angles because at the bottom
of<00:00:49.949> the<00:00:50.040> screen<00:00:50.280> we<00:00:50.610> have<00:00:50.820> on<00:00:51.059> ortho<00:00:51.860> if<00:00:53.239> we

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
of the screen we have on ortho if we

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.900 
of the screen we have on ortho if we
just<00:00:54.450> happen<00:00:54.810> to<00:00:54.840> click<00:00:55.590> on<00:00:55.800> any<00:00:56.160> one<00:00:56.520> of<00:00:56.579> these

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
just happen to click on any one of these

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.740 
just happen to click on any one of these
line<00:00:57.239> segments<00:00:57.930> we'll<00:00:58.260> see<00:00:58.649> that<00:00:58.890> they're<00:00:59.070> all

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
line segments we'll see that they're all

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.630 
line segments we'll see that they're all
individual<00:01:00.750> ok<00:01:01.470> so<00:01:01.530> at<00:01:01.800> any<00:01:01.980> point<00:01:02.340> we<00:01:02.520> could

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
individual ok so at any point we could

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.969 
individual ok so at any point we could
click<00:01:02.850> on<00:01:03.030> one<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.570> hit<00:01:03.780> erase<00:01:04.199> or<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.710> Delete

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
click on one and hit erase or the Delete

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.850 
click on one and hit erase or the Delete
key<00:01:05.009> and<00:01:05.460> get<00:01:06.180> rid<00:01:06.660> of<00:01:06.690> one<00:01:06.960> of<00:01:06.990> those<00:01:07.229> okay<00:01:07.800> so

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
key and get rid of one of those okay so

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.530 
key and get rid of one of those okay so
if<00:01:08.070> we<00:01:08.190> wanted<00:01:08.399> to<00:01:08.520> create<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:08.820> shape<00:01:09.240> for

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
if we wanted to create a shape for

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.300 
if we wanted to create a shape for
example<00:01:09.600> with<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.530> line<00:01:10.710> command<00:01:11.009> we<00:01:11.190> would

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
example with the line command we would

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.170 
example with the line command we would
see<00:01:11.490> they're<00:01:11.670> all<00:01:12.200> individual<00:01:13.200> lines<00:01:14.090> so<00:01:15.090> I'll

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
see they're all individual lines so I'll

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.230 
see they're all individual lines so I'll
click<00:01:15.360> on<00:01:15.509> line<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:16.220> I<00:01:17.220> will<00:01:17.399> click<00:01:18.119> on<00:01:18.180> my

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
click on line and I will click on my

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.540 
click on line and I will click on my
starting<00:01:18.750> point<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.289> then<00:01:19.979> I<00:01:20.009> will<00:01:20.220> pull<00:01:20.430> the

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:20.550 
starting point and then I will pull the

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.900 
starting point and then I will pull the
mouse<00:01:20.700> up<00:01:20.940> and<00:01:21.420> maybe<00:01:21.690> I<00:01:21.840> will<00:01:21.930> make<00:01:22.170> this<00:01:22.470> a

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:22.910 
mouse up and maybe I will make this a

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:27.500 
mouse up and maybe I will make this a
10-foot<00:01:24.290> long<00:01:25.290> line<00:01:25.619> I<00:01:26.030> will<00:01:27.030> pull<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.330> mouse

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
10-foot long line I will pull the mouse

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:32.690 
10-foot long line I will pull the mouse
over<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.409> do<00:01:28.920> 10<00:01:29.430> feet<00:01:29.790> again<00:01:31.369> straight<00:01:32.369> down

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
over and do 10 feet again straight down

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:39.800 
over and do 10 feet again straight down
10<00:01:33.600> feet<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:35.119> then<00:01:36.119> over<00:01:37.369> 10<00:01:38.369> feet<00:01:39.240> so<00:01:39.659> I've

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
10 feet and then over 10 feet so I've

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.690 
10 feet and then over 10 feet so I've
created<00:01:40.049> a<00:01:41.270> box<00:01:42.270> that's<00:01:42.630> 10<00:01:43.080> by<00:01:43.350> 10<00:01:43.650> if<00:01:43.920> I<00:01:44.400> click

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
created a box that's 10 by 10 if I click

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:51.160 
created a box that's 10 by 10 if I click
on<00:01:44.880> this<00:01:45.119> each<00:01:45.869> line<00:01:46.740> is<00:01:47.100> an<00:01:47.400> individual<00:01:48.090> line

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.440 

well<00:01:52.170> what<00:01:52.920> if<00:01:53.159> I<00:01:53.369> wanted<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:53.880> do<00:01:54.030> that<00:01:54.240> a

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
well what if I wanted to do that a

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.880 
well what if I wanted to do that a
little<00:01:55.110> more<00:01:55.320> easily

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
little more easily

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.120 
little more easily
I<00:01:56.040> could<00:01:56.670> use<00:01:56.820> my<00:01:57.030> object<00:01:57.570> snap<00:01:58.460> use<00:01:59.460> line<00:01:59.820> and

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
I could use my object snap use line and

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:11.479 
I could use my object snap use line and
do<00:02:02.130> 10<00:02:03.680> feet<00:02:04.880> by<00:02:05.880> 10<00:02:05.909> feet<00:02:09.320> by<00:02:10.320> 10<00:02:10.350> feet<00:02:10.679> and

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
do 10 feet by 10 feet by 10 feet and

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.590 
do 10 feet by 10 feet by 10 feet and
then<00:02:12.420> at<00:02:12.570> this<00:02:12.720> point<00:02:13.079> I<00:02:13.350> actually<00:02:13.739> would<00:02:14.250> not

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
then at this point I actually would not

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.210 
then at this point I actually would not
have<00:02:15.600> to<00:02:15.900> type<00:02:16.110> in<00:02:16.320> the<00:02:16.350> measurement<00:02:16.950> I<00:02:17.040> would

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
have to type in the measurement I would

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.280 
have to type in the measurement I would
have<00:02:17.400> a<00:02:17.430> couple<00:02:17.670> of<00:02:17.910> other<00:02:18.060> options<00:02:18.329> with

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
have a couple of other options with

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.430 
have a couple of other options with
objects<00:02:19.920> snap<00:02:20.070> on<00:02:20.570> when<00:02:21.570> I<00:02:21.600> pull<00:02:22.049> the<00:02:22.230> mouse

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
objects snap on when I pull the mouse

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.440 
objects snap on when I pull the mouse
over<00:02:22.769> and<00:02:23.130> hover<00:02:23.549> a<00:02:23.700> little<00:02:23.970> bit

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
over and hover a little bit

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
over and hover a little bit
I<00:02:24.480> get<00:02:25.290> that<00:02:25.530> snapping<00:02:26.100> to<00:02:26.489> the<00:02:26.519> endpoint<00:02:27.470> so

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
I get that snapping to the endpoint so

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.220 
I get that snapping to the endpoint so
if<00:02:28.560> I<00:02:28.650> click<00:02:29.100> I<00:02:29.430> know<00:02:29.880> that<00:02:30.359> that<00:02:30.540> closed<00:02:30.930> up

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
if I click I know that that closed up

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.809 
if I click I know that that closed up
very<00:02:31.799> very<00:02:31.889> nicely<00:02:32.370> so<00:02:32.730> if<00:02:32.790> i<00:02:32.880> zoom<00:02:32.910> in<00:02:33.299> I<00:02:33.510> see

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
very very nicely so if i zoom in I see

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:36.199 
very very nicely so if i zoom in I see
that<00:02:34.030> that's<00:02:34.239> a<00:02:34.359> nice<00:02:34.689> 90-degree<00:02:35.200> angle<00:02:35.950> I

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
that that's a nice 90-degree angle I

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.239 
that that's a nice 90-degree angle I
could<00:02:37.209> accomplish<00:02:37.540> the<00:02:37.780> same<00:02:38.109> thing<00:02:38.469> by<00:02:39.219> doing

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:39.249 
could accomplish the same thing by doing

00:02:39.249 --> 00:02:46.069 
could accomplish the same thing by doing
my<00:02:39.819> line<00:02:40.090> again<00:02:40.450> and<00:02:40.889> doing<00:02:41.889> 10<00:02:42.760> feet<00:02:43.889> 10<00:02:44.889> feet

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 
my line again and doing 10 feet 10 feet

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:49.860 
my line again and doing 10 feet 10 feet
10<00:02:47.079> feet<00:02:47.319> and<00:02:47.879> then<00:02:48.879> here<00:02:49.269> if<00:02:49.389> we<00:02:49.510> take<00:02:49.629> a<00:02:49.689> look

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
10 feet and then here if we take a look

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.259 
10 feet and then here if we take a look
at<00:02:50.019> the<00:02:50.109> command<00:02:50.439> line<00:02:50.700> you'll<00:02:51.700> see<00:02:51.819> that<00:02:52.150> we

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
at the command line you'll see that we

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.720 
at the command line you'll see that we
can<00:02:52.420> actually<00:02:52.629> type<00:02:52.989> in<00:02:53.170> C<00:02:53.590> to<00:02:54.159> close<00:02:54.370> the

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
can actually type in C to close the

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.039 
can actually type in C to close the
object<00:02:55.239> when<00:02:55.959> you<00:02:56.170> do<00:02:56.379> a<00:02:56.709> C<00:02:57.189> for<00:02:57.519> close<00:02:57.879> it<00:02:58.450> will

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
object when you do a C for close it will

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:01.289 
object when you do a C for close it will
take<00:02:59.349> the<00:02:59.590> point<00:02:59.980> you're<00:03:00.159> at<00:03:00.310> right<00:03:00.579> now<00:03:00.639> and

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299 
take the point you're at right now and

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:03.869 
take the point you're at right now and
connect<00:03:02.049> it<00:03:02.200> with<00:03:02.230> a<00:03:02.379> line<00:03:02.680> to<00:03:03.129> the<00:03:03.249> point<00:03:03.669> you

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:03.879 
connect it with a line to the point you

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:07.470 
connect it with a line to the point you
started<00:03:04.689> with<00:03:04.900> okay<00:03:05.769> so<00:03:05.859> if<00:03:06.040> I<00:03:06.099> do<00:03:06.159> C<00:03:06.700> enter<00:03:07.209> I

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
started with okay so if I do C enter I

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.000 
started with okay so if I do C enter I
have<00:03:08.349> a<00:03:08.409> nice<00:03:08.799> closed<00:03:09.579> box<00:03:10.239> again<00:03:10.659> all<00:03:11.010> with

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
have a nice closed box again all with

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.649 
have a nice closed box again all with
individual<00:03:12.760> lines<00:03:13.650> if<00:03:14.790> I<00:03:15.790> wanted<00:03:16.150> these<00:03:16.329> to<00:03:16.359> be

00:03:16.649 --> 00:03:16.659 
individual lines if I wanted these to be

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:19.830 
individual lines if I wanted these to be
all<00:03:16.810> continuous<00:03:17.709> I<00:03:18.099> could<00:03:18.879> actually<00:03:19.120> start

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
all continuous I could actually start

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.250 
all continuous I could actually start
out<00:03:20.109> with<00:03:20.680> a<00:03:20.739> polyline<00:03:21.579> if<00:03:22.569> we<00:03:22.750> look<00:03:22.959> up<00:03:23.079> at<00:03:23.230> our

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
out with a polyline if we look up at our

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.039 
out with a polyline if we look up at our

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
to line we have polyline okay so I'll

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:32.009 
to line we have polyline okay so I'll
click<00:03:30.010> on<00:03:30.129> polyline<00:03:30.760> and<00:03:31.090> you'll<00:03:31.569> see<00:03:31.840> that

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
click on polyline and you'll see that

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:33.659 
click on polyline and you'll see that
down<00:03:32.199> the<00:03:32.349> command<00:03:32.620> line<00:03:32.889> it's<00:03:33.250> referred<00:03:33.639> to

down the command line it's referred to

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:37.890 
down the command line it's referred to

do a click where I want to begin I'll

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:46.999 
do a click where I want to begin I'll
pull<00:03:43.299> the<00:03:43.419> most<00:03:43.599> up<00:03:43.810> and<00:03:44.109> I'll<00:03:44.709> do<00:03:45.009> 10<00:03:45.879> feet

feet<00:03:53.790> enter<00:03:54.930> down<00:03:55.930> 10<00:03:56.829> feet<00:03:57.549> enter<00:03:58.449> and<00:03:58.780> now<00:03:59.560> I

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
feet enter down 10 feet enter and now I

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.369 
feet enter down 10 feet enter and now I
have<00:03:59.979> the<00:04:00.280> same<00:04:00.609> options<00:04:01.389> really<00:04:01.720> of<00:04:02.109> either

00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:02.379 
have the same options really of either

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:06.530 
have the same options really of either
typing<00:04:03.040> in<00:04:03.220> 10<00:04:03.519> feet<00:04:04.229> using<00:04:05.229> object<00:04:05.859> snaps<00:04:06.129> or

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
typing in 10 feet using object snaps or

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.559 
typing in 10 feet using object snaps or
c4<00:04:07.540> close<00:04:08.019> to<00:04:08.500> close<00:04:08.769> this<00:04:09.040> shape<00:04:09.370> so<00:04:10.359> right

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 
c4 close to close this shape so right

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:12.270 
c4 close to close this shape so right
now<00:04:10.750> I'll<00:04:10.870> just<00:04:11.019> use<00:04:11.199> object<00:04:11.620> snaps<00:04:11.680> to<00:04:12.069> click

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
now I'll just use object snaps to click

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.420 
now I'll just use object snaps to click
it<00:04:12.459> and<00:04:12.609> I'll<00:04:13.120> hit<00:04:13.269> enter<00:04:13.769> so<00:04:14.769> essentially

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
it and I'll hit enter so essentially

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.060 
it and I'll hit enter so essentially
these<00:04:15.549> all<00:04:15.790> look<00:04:16.389> exactly<00:04:16.659> the<00:04:17.440> same<00:04:17.709> at<00:04:17.919> this

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
these all look exactly the same at this

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.060 
these all look exactly the same at this
point<00:04:18.539> these<00:04:19.539> three<00:04:19.959> will<00:04:20.109> all<00:04:20.259> be<00:04:20.440> individual

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
point these three will all be individual

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.640 
point these three will all be individual
lines<00:04:21.310> this<00:04:21.820> one<00:04:22.060> will<00:04:22.180> be<00:04:22.300> a<00:04:22.330> polyline<00:04:22.930> so

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
lines this one will be a polyline so

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.379 
lines this one will be a polyline so
this<00:04:24.009> one<00:04:24.190> I<00:04:24.219> can<00:04:24.430> click<00:04:24.639> on<00:04:24.820> and<00:04:25.030> see<00:04:25.210> that

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:25.389 
this one I can click on and see that

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:29.010 
this one I can click on and see that
it's<00:04:25.599> a<00:04:25.900> singular<00:04:26.289> group<00:04:27.039> of<00:04:27.520> lines<00:04:27.849> here<00:04:28.020> this

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
it's a singular group of lines here this

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.899 
it's a singular group of lines here this
one<00:04:29.259> if<00:04:29.380> I<00:04:29.469> click<00:04:29.710> on<00:04:29.860> it<00:04:29.940> it's<00:04:30.940> all<00:04:31.380> one

00:04:32.899 --> 00:04:32.909 
one if I click on it it's all one

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:36.870 
one if I click on it it's all one
continuous<00:04:34.050> polyline<00:04:35.130> okay<00:04:36.130> so<00:04:36.669> that's

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
continuous polyline okay so that's

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.100 
continuous polyline okay so that's
polyline<00:04:37.750> and<00:04:38.280> then<00:04:39.280> you<00:04:39.430> click<00:04:39.880> to<00:04:40.210> create

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
polyline and then you click to create

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.000 
polyline and then you click to create
your<00:04:41.440> shape

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:49.570 

and<00:04:46.540> you<00:04:47.540> have<00:04:47.720> the<00:04:47.900> options<00:04:48.380> to<00:04:48.530> do<00:04:48.860> a<00:04:49.190> click

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
and you have the options to do a click

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.810 
and you have the options to do a click
or<00:04:49.820> a<00:04:49.880> see<00:04:50.180> for<00:04:50.420> clothes<00:04:51.340> just<00:04:52.340> like<00:04:52.550> we<00:04:52.670> did

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820 
or a see for clothes just like we did

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.050 
or a see for clothes just like we did
before<00:04:52.910> but<00:04:53.660> this<00:04:53.810> is<00:04:53.870> a<00:04:54.050> continuous<00:04:54.800> line

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
before but this is a continuous line

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.140 
before but this is a continuous line
versus<00:04:56.470> individual<00:04:57.470> lines<00:04:57.710> this<00:04:58.550> will<00:04:58.760> become

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
versus individual lines this will become

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.030 
versus individual lines this will become
much<00:04:59.390> more<00:04:59.630> important<00:05:00.200> later<00:05:00.410> when<00:05:00.830> we<00:05:00.920> get

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.040 
much more important later when we get

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.830 
much more important later when we get
into<00:05:01.100> doing<00:05:01.580> things<00:05:01.790> like<00:05:01.850> hatching<00:05:02.600> and

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
into doing things like hatching and

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.890 
into doing things like hatching and
gradients<00:05:03.670> things<00:05:04.670> like<00:05:04.850> fill<00:05:05.150> it<00:05:05.270> in<00:05:05.360> chamfer

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900 
gradients things like fill it in chamfer

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.560 
gradients things like fill it in chamfer
and<00:05:06.110> then<00:05:06.830> it<00:05:07.130> becomes<00:05:07.370> very<00:05:07.460> critical<00:05:07.970> when

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:08.570 
and then it becomes very critical when

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:11.650 
and then it becomes very critical when
you're<00:05:08.690> moving<00:05:08.810> from<00:05:08.990> 2d<00:05:09.680> to<00:05:09.710> 3d<00:05:10.090> so<00:05:11.090> play

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:11.660 
you're moving from 2d to 3d so play

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.990 
you're moving from 2d to 3d so play
around<00:05:11.840> and<00:05:12.410> you<00:05:13.340> know<00:05:13.460> feel<00:05:13.730> out<00:05:13.850> the

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
around and you know feel out the

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.330 
around and you know feel out the
difference<00:05:14.330> between<00:05:14.480> using<00:05:15.100> simple<00:05:16.100> lines

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
difference between using simple lines

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.810 
difference between using simple lines
segments<00:05:17.090> that's<00:05:17.690> still<00:05:18.020> chained<00:05:18.580> versus<00:05:19.610> a

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:19.820 
segments that's still chained versus a

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:24.150 
segments that's still chained versus a
polyline<00:05:20.510> that<00:05:20.870> will<00:05:21.140> be<00:05:21.380> one<00:05:22.360> continuous

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 
polyline that will be one continuous

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.300 
polyline that will be one continuous
unit<00:05:25.160> now<00:05:26.170> sometimes<00:05:27.170> you'll<00:05:27.470> be<00:05:27.590> drawing<00:05:27.920> and

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.310 
unit now sometimes you'll be drawing and

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:30.580 
unit now sometimes you'll be drawing and
you<00:05:28.910> start<00:05:29.810> out<00:05:29.900> with<00:05:29.960> a<00:05:30.110> line<00:05:30.350> but<00:05:30.470> you

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:30.590 
you start out with a line but you

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:31.750 
you start out with a line but you
realize<00:05:30.860> that<00:05:30.890> you<00:05:31.100> want<00:05:31.280> it<00:05:31.340> to<00:05:31.580> be<00:05:31.670> all

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:31.760 
realize that you want it to be all

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.230 
realize that you want it to be all
connected<00:05:32.360> or<00:05:32.480> something<00:05:32.900> we<00:05:33.440> can<00:05:33.620> actually

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.240 
connected or something we can actually

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.490 
connected or something we can actually
join<00:05:35.240> lines<00:05:35.780> together<00:05:36.760> ok<00:05:37.760> so<00:05:37.820> here<00:05:38.720> even

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.500 
join lines together ok so here even

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.970 
join lines together ok so here even
though<00:05:39.860> these<00:05:40.100> are<00:05:40.310> all<00:05:40.810> separate<00:05:41.950> what<00:05:42.950> we

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:42.980 
though these are all separate what we

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:47.860 
though these are all separate what we
can<00:05:43.340> do<00:05:43.670> is<00:05:44.380> a<00:05:45.380> modify<00:05:46.070> command<00:05:46.670> called<00:05:47.120> join

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:47.870 
can do is a modify command called join

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:51.520 
can do is a modify command called join
so<00:05:48.650> under<00:05:48.950> the<00:05:49.100> Home<00:05:49.400> tab<00:05:49.870> if<00:05:50.870> I<00:05:50.990> come<00:05:51.230> to<00:05:51.260> the

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:51.530 
so under the Home tab if I come to the

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:54.940 
so under the Home tab if I come to the
modify<00:05:51.980> panel<00:05:53.260> click<00:05:54.260> that<00:05:54.410> little<00:05:54.620> arrow

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:54.950 
modify panel click that little arrow

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:57.310 
modify panel click that little arrow
what<00:05:55.790> we<00:05:55.910> do<00:05:56.090> is<00:05:56.240> look<00:05:56.419> for<00:05:56.480> a<00:05:56.660> button<00:05:56.900> that

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:57.320 
what we do is look for a button that

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.560 
what we do is look for a button that
looks<00:05:57.680> like<00:05:57.860> this<00:05:58.340> where<00:05:58.730> it's<00:05:58.910> two<00:05:59.180> arrows

00:05:59.560 --> 00:05:59.570 
looks like this where it's two arrows

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:00.909 
looks like this where it's two arrows
that<00:05:59.660> are<00:05:59.720> kind<00:05:59.930> of<00:05:59.960> pointing<00:06:00.410> towards<00:06:00.770> each

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:00.919 
that are kind of pointing towards each

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:04.900 
that are kind of pointing towards each
other<00:06:01.120> this<00:06:02.120> is<00:06:02.390> called<00:06:02.840> join<00:06:03.669> so<00:06:04.669> I'm<00:06:04.760> going

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:04.910 
other this is called join so I'm going

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:07.330 
other this is called join so I'm going
to<00:06:05.000> pick<00:06:05.180> that<00:06:05.450> and<00:06:05.780> then<00:06:06.169> I<00:06:06.200> will<00:06:06.410> pick<00:06:06.620> all<00:06:06.860> of

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:07.340 
to pick that and then I will pick all of

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.070 
to pick that and then I will pick all of
my<00:06:07.490> individual<00:06:08.150> lines<00:06:08.419> they're<00:06:08.630> making<00:06:08.960> up

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:09.080 
my individual lines they're making up

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.840 
my individual lines they're making up
the<00:06:09.230> square<00:06:09.880> once<00:06:10.880> I<00:06:11.000> have<00:06:11.210> them<00:06:11.330> all<00:06:11.510> selected

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:12.850 
the square once I have them all selected

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:15.820 
the square once I have them all selected
you'll<00:06:13.850> see<00:06:14.090> down<00:06:14.210> here<00:06:14.480> at<00:06:14.540> say<00:06:14.750> it<00:06:14.900> says<00:06:15.290> join

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:15.830 
you'll see down here at say it says join

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.650 
you'll see down here at say it says join
select<00:06:16.280> objects<00:06:16.640> to<00:06:16.700> join<00:06:16.940> I<00:06:17.150> just<00:06:17.419> hit<00:06:17.540> the

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:17.660 
select objects to join I just hit the

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:21.190 
select objects to join I just hit the
enter<00:06:17.870> key<00:06:19.330> then<00:06:20.330> it<00:06:20.450> tells<00:06:20.600> me<00:06:20.750> that<00:06:20.780> for

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:21.200 
enter key then it tells me that for

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.370 
enter key then it tells me that for
objects<00:06:21.919> converted<00:06:22.460> to<00:06:22.640> one<00:06:22.910> polyline<00:06:23.750> so

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:24.380 
objects converted to one polyline so

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:26.980 
objects converted to one polyline so
where<00:06:24.830> there<00:06:25.010> was<00:06:25.100> once<00:06:25.370> for<00:06:25.880> there<00:06:26.570> is<00:06:26.780> now

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:26.990 
where there was once for there is now

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:32.280 
where there was once for there is now
one<00:06:27.730> okay<00:06:28.730> so<00:06:28.970> I<00:06:29.840> can<00:06:30.050> also<00:06:30.290> type<00:06:30.740> in<00:06:31.070> join<00:06:32.000> or

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:32.290 
one okay so I can also type in join or

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:37.180 
one okay so I can also type in join or
just<00:06:33.290> the<00:06:33.500> letter<00:06:33.740> J<00:06:34.190> is<00:06:34.400> the<00:06:34.430> shortcut<00:06:36.190> select

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:37.190 
just the letter J is the shortcut select

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:40.870 
just the letter J is the shortcut select
a<00:06:37.910> group<00:06:38.450> of<00:06:38.630> four<00:06:38.990> lines<00:06:39.290> here<00:06:39.770> hit<00:06:40.190> enter<00:06:40.610> and

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:40.880 
a group of four lines here hit enter and

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.270 
a group of four lines here hit enter and
it<00:06:41.600> will<00:06:41.630> join<00:06:42.050> them<00:06:42.260> all<00:06:42.410> together<00:06:42.740> into<00:06:43.250> a

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:43.280 
it will join them all together into a

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.840 
it will join them all together into a
singular<00:06:43.730> polyline<00:06:45.190> likewise<00:06:46.190> once

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:46.850 
singular polyline likewise once

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:48.790 
singular polyline likewise once
something's<00:06:47.240> actually<00:06:47.470> joined<00:06:48.470> together

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:48.800 
something's actually joined together

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.430 
something's actually joined together
into<00:06:49.400> a<00:06:49.550> polyline<00:06:50.150> whether<00:06:50.450> you<00:06:50.600> use<00:06:50.870> join<00:06:51.200> or

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:51.440 
into a polyline whether you use join or

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:52.990 
into a polyline whether you use join or
actually<00:06:51.740> drew<00:06:51.950> it<00:06:51.979> that<00:06:52.190> way<00:06:52.370> you<00:06:52.820> can

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:53.000 
actually drew it that way you can

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.920 
actually drew it that way you can
actually<00:06:53.510> separate<00:06:54.380> them<00:06:54.680> as<00:06:54.890> well<00:06:55.520> so<00:06:56.419> what

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:56.930 
actually separate them as well so what

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:57.710 
actually separate them as well so what
we<00:06:56.960> do<00:06:57.229> there

00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:57.720 
we do there

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.860 
we do there
is<00:06:57.960> something<00:06:58.410> called<00:06:58.880> explode<00:06:59.880> okay<00:07:00.720> it

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:00.870 
is something called explode okay it

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:02.390 
is something called explode okay it
sounds<00:07:00.960> a<00:07:01.110> little<00:07:01.170> violent<00:07:01.710> but<00:07:01.950> it<00:07:02.010> gets<00:07:02.220> the

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:02.400 
sounds a little violent but it gets the

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.910 
sounds a little violent but it gets the
job<00:07:02.430> done<00:07:02.670> so<00:07:03.210> if<00:07:04.020> I<00:07:04.110> have<00:07:04.350> something<00:07:04.890> like

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:04.920 
job done so if I have something like

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:07.970 
job done so if I have something like
this<00:07:05.100> where<00:07:05.910> it's<00:07:06.420> these<00:07:06.960> different<00:07:07.590> twists

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:07.980 
this where it's these different twists

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:10.190 
this where it's these different twists
and<00:07:08.130> turns<00:07:08.310> so<00:07:08.640> it's<00:07:08.790> it's<00:07:09.270> a<00:07:09.390> polyline<00:07:09.930> but

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:10.200 
and turns so it's it's a polyline but

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.650 
and turns so it's it's a polyline but
it's<00:07:10.290> really<00:07:10.590> four<00:07:10.830> lines<00:07:11.100> if<00:07:12.030> we<00:07:12.270> come<00:07:12.450> up<00:07:12.480> to

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:12.660 
it's really four lines if we come up to

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:15.890 
it's really four lines if we come up to
the<00:07:12.750> modify<00:07:13.140> tab<00:07:13.640> below<00:07:14.640> the<00:07:14.910> eraser<00:07:15.570> there's

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:15.900 
the modify tab below the eraser there's

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:18.080 
the modify tab below the eraser there's
a<00:07:15.960> button<00:07:16.260> called<00:07:16.590> explode<00:07:17.490> and<00:07:17.760> it<00:07:17.850> looks

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:18.090 
a button called explode and it looks

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:20.450 
a button called explode and it looks
like<00:07:18.180> a<00:07:18.330> cube<00:07:18.840> that's<00:07:19.170> bursting<00:07:19.920> apart<00:07:20.220> at<00:07:20.370> the

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:20.460 
like a cube that's bursting apart at the

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:21.080 
like a cube that's bursting apart at the
seams

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:21.090 
seams

apart<00:07:46.200> into<00:07:46.610> four<00:07:47.610> separate<00:07:48.030> line<00:07:48.240> segments

00:07:48.909 --> 00:07:48.919 
apart into four separate line segments

00:07:48.919 --> 00:07:53.450 
apart into four separate line segments
so<00:07:49.919> in<00:07:50.460> a<00:07:50.940> way<00:07:51.240> the<00:07:51.690> process<00:07:51.960> of<00:07:52.460> creating

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:53.460 
so in a way the process of creating

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:55.880 
so in a way the process of creating
something<00:07:53.760> with<00:07:54.090> lines<00:07:54.450> or<00:07:54.840> polylines<00:07:55.530> and

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:55.890 
something with lines or polylines and

00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:58.400 
something with lines or polylines and
then<00:07:56.240> joining<00:07:57.240> them<00:07:57.360> are<00:07:57.480> exploding<00:07:57.840> them<00:07:58.140> you

00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:58.410 
then joining them are exploding them you

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:00.800 
then joining them are exploding them you
know<00:07:58.500> it's<00:07:58.650> really<00:07:59.040> fairly<00:07:59.310> fluid<00:07:59.850> so<00:08:00.180> you

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:00.810 
know it's really fairly fluid so you

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:01.940 
know it's really fairly fluid so you
know<00:08:00.870> depending<00:08:01.290> what<00:08:01.350> you're<00:08:01.530> looking<00:08:01.800> for

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:04.240 
know depending what you're looking for
it's<00:08:02.070> fairly<00:08:02.340> simple<00:08:02.669> to<00:08:02.820> go<00:08:03.090> back<00:08:03.600> and<00:08:03.840> forth

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:04.250 
it's fairly simple to go back and forth

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:08.660 
it's fairly simple to go back and forth
to<00:08:05.250> get<00:08:05.460> what<00:08:05.970> you're<00:08:06.120> looking<00:08:06.419> for
