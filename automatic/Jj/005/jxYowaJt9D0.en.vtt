00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
one side make sure that we have it lined

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:35.100 
one side make sure that we have it lined
up<00:03:10.430> by<00:03:11.430> dropping<00:03:12.060> the<00:03:12.090> saw<00:03:12.360> down

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.260 

we<00:03:36.110> put<00:03:36.320> our<00:03:36.440> two<00:03:36.680> 36-inch<00:03:37.400> pieces<00:03:38.060> together

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.270 
we put our two 36-inch pieces together

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:41.320 
we put our two 36-inch pieces together
and<00:03:38.720> make<00:03:39.140> sure<00:03:39.170> that<00:03:39.380> they're<00:03:39.710> flush<00:03:40.330> see

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
and make sure that they're flush see

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.750 
and make sure that they're flush see
that<00:03:41.480> this<00:03:41.600> one<00:03:41.870> is<00:03:41.900> here<00:03:42.860> longer<00:03:43.550> than<00:03:43.580> the

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
that this one is here longer than the

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.730 
that this one is here longer than the
other<00:03:43.910> one<00:03:44.090> so<00:03:44.450> we're<00:03:44.570> going<00:03:44.630> to<00:03:44.750> go<00:03:44.960> go<00:03:45.500> ahead

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:45.740 
other one so we're going to go go ahead

00:03:45.740 --> 00:04:01.420 
other one so we're going to go go ahead
and<00:03:45.860> cut<00:03:46.010> that<00:03:57.370> now<00:03:58.370> we're<00:03:58.580> going<00:03:58.670> to<00:03:58.730> move<00:04:00.430> our

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
and cut that now we're going to move our

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:14.620 
and cut that now we're going to move our
angle<00:04:02.000> to<00:04:02.240> 45

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:19.370 

then<00:04:15.630> we<00:04:15.780> cut<00:04:15.990> all<00:04:16.200> of<00:04:16.230> our<00:04:16.470> pieces<00:04:18.380> we're

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
then we cut all of our pieces we're

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.140 
then we cut all of our pieces we're
actually<00:04:19.500> going<00:04:19.830> to<00:04:19.920> need<00:04:20.040> 550<00:04:20.700> because<00:04:21.000> we're

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
actually going to need 550 because we're

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:22.370 
actually going to need 550 because we're
going<00:04:21.270> to<00:04:21.330> need<00:04:21.480> a<00:04:21.540> breaks<00:04:21.840> to<00:04:22.050> go<00:04:22.170> in<00:04:22.290> the

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
going to need a breaks to go in the

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.590 
going to need a breaks to go in the
middle<00:04:22.710> I'll<00:04:23.100> talk<00:04:23.400> about<00:04:23.430> that<00:04:26.480> so<00:04:27.480> we're

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
middle I'll talk about that so we're

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:33.290 
middle I'll talk about that so we're
going<00:04:27.690> to<00:04:27.810> cut<00:04:31.430> that's<00:04:32.430> the<00:04:32.580> basic<00:04:32.880> shape<00:04:33.000> of

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
going to cut that's the basic shape of

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.080 
going to cut that's the basic shape of
our<00:04:33.390> frame<00:04:33.720> Morini<00:04:34.590> we're<00:04:34.980> going<00:04:35.100> to<00:04:35.160> cut<00:04:35.400> the

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
our frame Morini we're going to cut the

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.940 
our frame Morini we're going to cut the
mall<00:04:36.270> in<00:04:36.420> 45<00:04:36.870> degree<00:04:37.140> angles<00:04:37.530> because<00:04:37.680> that's

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
mall in 45 degree angles because that's

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:40.760 
mall in 45 degree angles because that's
the<00:04:38.130> strongest<00:04:38.490> angle<00:04:39.360> that<00:04:39.630> you<00:04:39.690> can<00:04:40.020> have<00:04:40.230> if

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
the strongest angle that you can have if

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.220 
the strongest angle that you can have if
you<00:04:41.040> if<00:04:41.730> you<00:04:41.940> just<00:04:41.970> glue<00:04:42.390> the<00:04:42.510> two<00:04:42.540> pieces<00:04:42.900> like

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230 
you if you just glue the two pieces like

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:47.260 
you if you just glue the two pieces like
that<00:04:43.260> you'll<00:04:43.920> break<00:04:44.070> easily<00:04:45.590> we<00:04:46.590> line<00:04:46.830> it<00:04:46.860> up

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
that you'll break easily we line it up

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.060 
that you'll break easily we line it up
so<00:04:48.270> that<00:04:48.300> the<00:04:48.480> salt<00:04:48.960> of<00:04:49.170> the<00:04:49.290> blade<00:04:49.590> of<00:04:49.620> the<00:04:49.770> saw

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
so that the salt of the blade of the saw

00:04:50.070 --> 00:05:00.679 
so that the salt of the blade of the saw
is<00:04:50.400> touching<00:04:50.970> the<00:04:51.090> very<00:04:51.330> corner<00:04:52.070> outer<00:04:53.070> corner

00:05:00.679 --> 00:05:00.689 

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:02.969 

very<00:05:01.689> important<00:05:02.259> you<00:05:02.560> want<00:05:02.710> to<00:05:02.800> make<00:05:02.919> sure

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:02.979 
very important you want to make sure

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:06.540 
very important you want to make sure
that<00:05:03.219> your<00:05:03.699> angles<00:05:04.629> are<00:05:04.870> both<00:05:05.139> going<00:05:05.500> and<00:05:05.800> not

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
that your angles are both going and not

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.279 
that your angles are both going and not
the<00:05:06.759> same<00:05:07.030> direction<00:05:07.210> but<00:05:07.659> in<00:05:07.780> opposite

the same direction but in opposite
directions

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:33.700 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:42.159 

it's<00:05:34.210> going<00:05:34.360> to<00:05:34.420> look<00:05:34.570> something<00:05:34.750> like<00:05:35.200> this

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:42.169 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:45.420 

our<00:05:42.529> middle<00:05:42.919> grace<00:05:43.189> I<00:05:43.550> cut<00:05:44.270> to<00:05:44.389> 24<00:05:44.900> inches

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:45.430 
our middle grace I cut to 24 inches

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.480 
our middle grace I cut to 24 inches
because<00:05:46.430> that<00:05:46.669> was<00:05:46.849> was<00:05:47.389> left<00:05:47.599> of<00:05:47.749> the<00:05:47.779> wood

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:48.490 
because that was was left of the wood

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:55.510 
because that was was left of the wood
but<00:05:52.599> the<00:05:53.599> width<00:05:53.870> of<00:05:54.050> the<00:05:54.199> planks<00:05:54.680> are<00:05:54.860> about

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 
but the width of the planks are about

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.219 
but the width of the planks are about
three-fourths<00:05:56.210> of<00:05:56.389> an<00:05:56.539> inch<00:05:56.719> and<00:05:57.020> together

00:05:59.529 --> 00:05:59.539 
total an inch and a half so we're going

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:02.610 
total an inch and a half so we're going
to<00:05:59.629> need<00:05:59.779> to<00:05:59.930> cut<00:06:00.169> off<00:06:00.349> an<00:06:00.680> inch<00:06:01.370> and<00:06:01.550> a<00:06:01.610> half<00:06:01.639> on

to need to cut off an inch and a half on

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:06.570 
to need to cut off an inch and a half on
the<00:06:03.620> middle<00:06:03.830> brace<00:06:04.159> so<00:06:04.580> that<00:06:04.729> it<00:06:04.849> fits<00:06:05.090> inside
