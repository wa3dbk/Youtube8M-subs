00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 that we can find at a fair 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.540
 vintage how can we choose a good 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.919
 piece or identify a great opportunity 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.630
 from the hand of an authentic expert 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.590
 We visit one of the most fairs 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.590
 important of Spain 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.740
 an authentic bomber jacket of the 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:20.500
 50s a wedding dress the 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.750
 designer pedro rodrÃ­guez a costume of the 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.939
 queen victoria eugenia and is a hat 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.529
 of skin anticrisis price is only one 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:28.960
 small sample in the infinity of 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:31.510
 treasures that can be found diving 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.220
 in the past they are unique pieces that the 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.800
 young people now drive him crazy that 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:38.640
 the time they are distinguished for wearing that and 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:42.730
 dress that that not everyone can 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.260
 discover in stalls in street markets there are 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.780
 a kind of confusion between the 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.960
 vintage and the retro and the challenges are 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.149
 current pieces that have inspiration 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.300
 from the past but they are not necessarily 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:58.059
 neither manufactured nor ccoo nor designed in 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.039
 that time you also have to know that what 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:02.530
 vintage does not have to be necessarily 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:05.590
 second hand there are many pieces that 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.750
 they are excellent from factories or stocks as 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.460
 better from other merchants 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.890
 seasons that now have a lot 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.300
 value and that in the end maybe 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.690
 is unused, I just found 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.700
 this jewel of the 80s 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.370
 They come from an Italian factory in stock 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.930
 and they are unused and cost less than 50 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.930
 euros so I think I'll take them 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.230
 but if you're not a stylist too 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.060
 there are companies that help you get 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:33.240
 the biggest match to a piece of another 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.220
 era and create the most appropriate looks 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.530
 we are people envelopes of 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.480
 shoppings is we pray to people on how 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.870
 mix them from the vintage with the current 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:44.460
 then for example the cowboys that is 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.830
 a very current trend and that also 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.030
 Now come the cigarette bell we can 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.370
 combine with a sequined jacket 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.220
 from the 40s and you get a styling 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.870
 totally current and then the dresses 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.270

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.980

 Well, like the typical 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:26.610
