welcome to other planet manufacturing
and<00:00:05.819> we<00:00:06.150> are<00:00:06.299> now<00:00:06.480> in<00:00:06.629> the<00:00:06.750> board<00:00:07.080> Department

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:08.030

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:11.020 
and we are now in the board Department
you<00:00:09.030> can<00:00:09.179> see<00:00:09.330> here<00:00:09.540> we<00:00:09.660> have<00:00:09.809> several

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:11.030 
you can see here we have several

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.070 
you can see here we have several
prototype<00:00:12.030> boards<00:00:12.360> being<00:00:12.540> pressed<00:00:12.840> up

currently both of which are different

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.980 
currently both of which are different
and<00:00:15.690> are<00:00:16.320> in<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:16.710> process<00:00:16.800> of<00:00:17.810> research<00:00:18.810> and

what's going to have the concave and any
W<00:00:48.989> shape<00:00:49.289> or<00:00:49.820> pleasure<00:00:50.820> them<00:00:51.180> if<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:51.780> will

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
W shape or pleasure them if you will

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.060 
W shape or pleasure them if you will
incorporate<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:53.340> into<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:53.820> then

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
incorporate it into it and then

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.920 
incorporate it into it and then
secondarily<00:00:56.210> it<00:00:57.210> has<00:00:57.329> what<00:00:57.480> we<00:00:57.510> call<00:00:57.629> the

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
secondarily it has what we call the

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.549 
secondarily it has what we call the
stringer<00:00:58.469> which<00:00:59.160> is<00:00:59.309> going<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.489> have<00:00:59.730> the

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
stringer which is going to have the

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.100 
stringer which is going to have the
reinforcement<00:01:01.559> for<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.129> platform<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:03.110> also

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
reinforcement for the platform and also

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.420 
reinforcement for the platform and also
in<00:01:04.439> this<00:01:04.769> particular<00:01:04.979> case<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.729> half<00:01:06.090> inch<00:01:06.479> drop

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
in this particular case a half inch drop

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.870 
in this particular case a half inch drop
which<00:01:08.430> will<00:01:08.970> give<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.600> center<00:01:10.380> of<00:01:10.409> gravity<00:01:10.880> or

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
which will give the center of gravity or

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.760 
which will give the center of gravity or
which<00:01:12.390> will<00:01:12.570> give<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:12.990> lowest<00:01:13.320> semper

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
which will give it the lowest semper

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.160 
which will give it the lowest semper
center<00:01:14.220> of<00:01:14.310> gravity<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:14.880> gives<00:01:15.869> us<00:01:16.020> the

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
center of gravity and gives us the

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.460 
center of gravity and gives us the
ability<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.590> change<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:18.000> rake<00:01:18.360> on<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:19.170> truck

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
ability to change the rake on the truck

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.670 
ability to change the rake on the truck
we<00:01:20.460> could<00:01:20.580> either<00:01:20.700> press<00:01:21.119> it<00:01:21.299> in<00:01:21.420> or<00:01:21.720> in<00:01:22.320> this

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
we could either press it in or in this

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.700 
we could either press it in or in this
scenario<00:01:22.950> we're<00:01:23.729> actually<00:01:23.909> going<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.710> machine

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
scenario we're actually going to machine

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.670 
scenario we're actually going to machine
this<00:01:26.310> surface<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.420> different<00:01:28.020> angle<00:01:28.409> other

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
this surface to a different angle other

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.240 
this surface to a different angle other
than<00:01:29.250> what<00:01:29.820> it<00:01:29.909> was<00:01:30.030> originally<00:01:30.150> pressed<00:01:30.780> to

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
than what it was originally pressed to

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.060 
than what it was originally pressed to
so<00:01:32.250> by<00:01:33.150> doing<00:01:33.210> this<00:01:33.630> two-piece<00:01:34.110> system<00:01:34.560> we've

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
so by doing this two-piece system we've

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.210 
so by doing this two-piece system we've
actually<00:01:35.250> allowed<00:01:35.670> ourselves<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:36.390> build<00:01:37.380> two

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
actually allowed ourselves to build two

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.499 
actually allowed ourselves to build two
separate<00:01:38.820> components<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.920> then<00:01:41.360> put<00:01:42.360> them

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
separate components and then put them

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.230 
separate components and then put them
together<00:01:42.780> in<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.530> configuration<00:01:44.340> that's<00:01:45.060> going

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
together in a configuration that's going

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.719 
together in a configuration that's going
to<00:01:45.329> allow<00:01:45.450> us<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:45.990> do<00:01:46.290> all<00:01:46.860> sorts<00:01:47.610> of<00:01:47.670> different

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
to allow us to do all sorts of different

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.270 
to allow us to do all sorts of different
things<00:01:48.149> we<00:01:48.689> could<00:01:48.810> have<00:01:49.009> different<00:01:50.009> drop

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
things we could have different drop

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.550 
things we could have different drop
decks<00:01:50.640> different<00:01:51.390> heights<00:01:51.630> different<00:01:51.930> angles

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
decks different heights different angles

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.609 
decks different heights different angles
and<00:01:52.649> then<00:01:52.920> have<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.250> completely<00:01:53.939> unique

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
and then have a completely unique

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:56.719 
and then have a completely unique
platform<00:01:55.619> that's<00:01:56.189> going<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.430> be<00:01:56.520> more

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
platform that's going to be more

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.929 
platform that's going to be more
specific<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:57.329> certain<00:01:57.479> riders<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:58.790> we<00:01:59.790> use<00:01:59.909> a

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
specific to certain riders and we use a

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.520 
specific to certain riders and we use a
lot<00:02:00.060> less<00:02:00.210> wood<00:02:00.659> because<00:02:01.049> we<00:02:01.170> only<00:02:01.290> have<00:02:01.439> to

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
lot less wood because we only have to

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.469 
lot less wood because we only have to
reinforce<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:02.280> city<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.850> parts<00:02:03.270> of<00:02:03.360> the

titebond team has just introduced the
new

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
new

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000 
new
product<00:02:14.560> fusion<00:02:15.560> of<00:02:15.950> two<00:02:16.450> dissimilar

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
product fusion of two dissimilar

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.850 
product fusion of two dissimilar
components<00:02:20.320> and<00:02:21.320> the<00:02:22.100> best<00:02:22.310> part<00:02:22.520> is<00:02:22.760> it's

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860
