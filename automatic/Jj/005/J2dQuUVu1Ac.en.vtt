firstly it locks up nutrients within the

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.000 
firstly it locks up nutrients within the
field<00:02:53.540> so<00:02:54.080> they<00:02:54.200> can't<00:02:54.500> be<00:02:54.560> washed<00:02:54.800> away

rainfall<00:02:56.780> the<00:02:57.590> second<00:02:57.950> benefit<00:02:58.370> is<00:02:58.520> that<00:02:59.000> it

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
rainfall the second benefit is that it

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.780 
rainfall the second benefit is that it
stops<00:02:59.540> soil<00:02:59.810> erosion<00:03:00.110> down<00:03:00.590> the<00:03:00.770> slope<00:03:01.010> so<00:03:01.640> if

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
stops soil erosion down the slope so if

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.970 
stops soil erosion down the slope so if
you<00:03:01.910> can<00:03:02.120> leave<00:03:02.300> stubble<00:03:02.870> or<00:03:03.200> plant<00:03:03.590> a<00:03:03.740> catch

digging<00:04:11.450> this<00:04:11.600> in<00:04:11.780> March<00:04:12.050> 2011<00:04:12.920> when<00:04:13.910> there

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
digging this in March 2011 when there

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.420 
digging this in March 2011 when there
was<00:04:14.150> no<00:04:14.330> water<00:04:14.600> flow<00:04:14.959> through<00:04:15.230> this<00:04:15.470> ditch<00:04:15.709> 12

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
was no water flow through this ditch 12

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.780 
was no water flow through this ditch 12
months<00:04:16.730> ago<00:04:16.970> we<00:04:17.630> excavated<00:04:18.230> over<00:04:18.500> 150<00:04:19.340> tons<00:04:19.580> of

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:19.790 
months ago we excavated over 150 tons of

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.690 
months ago we excavated over 150 tons of
soil<00:04:20.060> from<00:04:20.359> these<00:04:20.570> two<00:04:20.840> areas<00:04:21.049> of<00:04:21.230> the<00:04:21.440> farm<00:04:21.700> we

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
soil from these two areas of the farm we

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.550 
soil from these two areas of the farm we
instated<00:04:23.150> the<00:04:23.419> reed<00:04:23.600> beds<00:04:23.870> and<00:04:24.080> as<00:04:24.290> you<00:04:24.410> can

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
instated the reed beds and as you can

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.430 
instated the reed beds and as you can
see<00:04:24.800> the<00:04:25.010> reeds<00:04:25.250> have<00:04:25.460> still<00:04:26.030> to<00:04:26.750> get<00:04:26.930> to<00:04:27.169> full

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
see the reeds have still to get to full

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.710 
see the reeds have still to get to full
size<00:04:27.710> and<00:04:27.919> maturity<00:04:28.310> in<00:04:28.730> time<00:04:29.090> the<00:04:29.360> reeds<00:04:29.540> will

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
size and maturity in time the reeds will

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.690 
size and maturity in time the reeds will
develop<00:04:30.080> to<00:04:30.230> cover<00:04:30.440> this<00:04:30.560> whole<00:04:30.800> area<00:04:30.830> they'll

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700 
develop to cover this whole area they'll

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.330 
develop to cover this whole area they'll
then<00:04:31.910> provide<00:04:32.240> habitat<00:04:32.810> for<00:04:32.840> birds<00:04:33.650> like<00:04:34.010> Reed

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
then provide habitat for birds like Reed

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.670 
then provide habitat for birds like Reed
buntings<00:04:34.880> and<00:04:35.180> also<00:04:35.810> great<00:04:36.050> insect<00:04:36.500> habitat

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
buntings and also great insect habitat

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.130 
buntings and also great insect habitat
so<00:04:37.370> as<00:04:37.580> the<00:04:37.730> water<00:04:37.940> passes<00:04:38.090> through<00:04:38.540> the<00:04:38.870> reed

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:39.140 
so as the water passes through the reed

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:40.990 
so as the water passes through the reed
beds<00:04:39.410> it's<00:04:39.710> being<00:04:39.980> cleaned<00:04:40.370> the<00:04:40.640> reeds<00:04:40.850> are

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
beds it's being cleaned the reeds are

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.180 
beds it's being cleaned the reeds are
taking<00:04:41.419> any<00:04:41.660> fertilizer<00:04:42.410> and<00:04:42.620> nutrients<00:04:43.040> out

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
taking any fertilizer and nutrients out

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.640 
taking any fertilizer and nutrients out
of<00:04:43.370> the<00:04:43.460> water<00:04:43.690> the<00:04:44.690> water<00:04:44.810> then<00:04:45.110> returns<00:04:45.530> to

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
of the water the water then returns to

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.100 
of the water the water then returns to
the<00:04:45.740> existing<00:04:46.280> ditch<00:04:46.490> and<00:04:46.790> heads<00:04:47.600> off<00:04:47.780> down<00:04:48.080> to

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
the existing ditch and heads off down to

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.050 
the existing ditch and heads off down to
the<00:04:48.320> local<00:04:48.500> brook<00:04:48.830> the<00:04:49.370> theory<00:04:49.789> says<00:04:50.030> that

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
the local brook the theory says that

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.450 
the local brook the theory says that
this<00:04:50.780> water<00:04:51.020> should<00:04:51.560> have<00:04:51.710> a<00:04:51.740> higher<00:04:51.979> quality

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
this water should have a higher quality

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.839 
this water should have a higher quality
but<00:04:52.940> it's<00:04:53.090> very<00:04:53.180> important<00:04:53.750> for<00:04:53.930> us<00:04:53.990> as<00:04:54.320> land

00:04:54.839 --> 00:04:54.849 
but it's very important for us as land

00:04:54.849 --> 00:05:01.980 
but it's very important for us as land
managers<00:04:55.240> to<00:04:55.689> monitor<00:04:55.809> that<00:05:00.419> step<00:05:01.419> 5

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
managers to monitor that step 5

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.969 
managers to monitor that step 5
is<00:05:02.050> tracking<00:05:02.740> water<00:05:03.069> use<00:05:03.399> or<00:05:03.909> monitoring<00:05:04.979> this

is tracking water use or monitoring this

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:07.589 
is tracking water use or monitoring this
is<00:05:06.159> a<00:05:06.189> very<00:05:06.429> important<00:05:06.909> management<00:05:07.179> tool

00:05:07.589 --> 00:05:07.599 
is a very important management tool

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:09.749 
is a very important management tool
primarily<00:05:08.529> to<00:05:08.740> work<00:05:08.889> out<00:05:09.129> if<00:05:09.399> you're<00:05:09.550> losing

00:05:09.749 --> 00:05:09.759 
primarily to work out if you're losing

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:12.989 
primarily to work out if you're losing
water<00:05:10.149> from<00:05:10.419> your<00:05:10.539> system<00:05:11.399> which<00:05:12.399> can<00:05:12.699> indeed

00:05:12.989 --> 00:05:12.999 
water from your system which can indeed

00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:15.329 
water from your system which can indeed
cost<00:05:13.330> you<00:05:13.479> a<00:05:13.509> lot<00:05:13.689> of<00:05:13.749> money<00:05:14.050> over<00:05:15.009> a<00:05:15.159> very

00:05:15.329 --> 00:05:15.339 
cost you a lot of money over a very

00:05:15.339 --> 00:05:17.790 
cost you a lot of money over a very
short<00:05:15.459> period<00:05:15.759> of<00:05:16.059> time<00:05:16.469> whenever<00:05:17.469> we're

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
short period of time whenever we're

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.249 
short period of time whenever we're
doing<00:05:18.490> more<00:05:18.819> water<00:05:19.029> repairs<00:05:19.539> on<00:05:19.689> the<00:05:19.779> farm<00:05:20.020> day

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:20.259 
doing more water repairs on the farm day

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:22.260 
doing more water repairs on the farm day
we'll<00:05:20.679> try<00:05:20.919> and<00:05:21.009> put<00:05:21.189> meters<00:05:21.580> in<00:05:21.729> so<00:05:22.029> we<00:05:22.119> can

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
we'll try and put meters in so we can

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.389 
we'll try and put meters in so we can
accurately<00:05:22.419> monitor<00:05:23.020> any<00:05:23.499> lost<00:05:24.009> between

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:24.399 
accurately monitor any lost between

00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:26.519 
accurately monitor any lost between
sections<00:05:24.879> within<00:05:25.149> the<00:05:25.240> farm<00:05:25.599> supply<00:05:26.020> the

00:05:26.519 --> 00:05:26.529 
sections within the farm supply the

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:27.959 
sections within the farm supply the
other<00:05:26.649> area<00:05:26.979> of<00:05:27.009> monitoring<00:05:27.490> which<00:05:27.669> we<00:05:27.819> do<00:05:27.939> a

00:05:27.959 --> 00:05:27.969 
other area of monitoring which we do a

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:31.469 
other area of monitoring which we do a
lot<00:05:28.179> of<00:05:28.800> it's<00:05:29.800> the<00:05:29.979> quality<00:05:30.369> of<00:05:30.490> water<00:05:30.669> so<00:05:31.360> we

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:31.479 
lot of it's the quality of water so we

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:33.989 
lot of it's the quality of water so we
have<00:05:31.509> nitrate<00:05:32.110> and<00:05:32.349> phosphate<00:05:32.499> kits<00:05:33.099> that<00:05:33.339> we

00:05:33.989 --> 00:05:33.999 
have nitrate and phosphate kits that we

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:36.570 
have nitrate and phosphate kits that we
can<00:05:34.179> analyze<00:05:34.330> water<00:05:34.899> as<00:05:35.559> it<00:05:35.800> leaves<00:05:36.009> the<00:05:36.219> farm

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
can analyze water as it leaves the farm

weather circumstances from this we can

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:19.350 
weather circumstances from this we can
use<00:06:17.709> that<00:06:17.860> information<00:06:18.039> in<00:06:18.699> subsequent<00:06:19.119> years
