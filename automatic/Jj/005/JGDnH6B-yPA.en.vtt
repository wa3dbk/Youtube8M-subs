for<00:01:15.580> the<00:01:15.640> older<00:01:15.850> dogs<00:01:16.060> because<00:01:16.330> they<00:01:16.360> probably

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
for the older dogs because they probably

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:17.969

it's<00:01:29.350> where<00:01:29.500> the<00:01:29.590> dog<00:01:29.770> worksheet<00:01:30.280> so<00:01:30.490> that's

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:31.120 
it's where the dog worksheet so that's

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.520 
it's where the dog worksheet so that's
just<00:01:31.240> an<00:01:31.450> exercise<00:01:31.659> that<00:01:31.840> we<00:01:32.080> do<00:01:32.200> with<00:01:32.350> young

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
just an exercise that we do with young

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:53.050 
just an exercise that we do with young
dogs<00:01:32.770> really

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.670 

people<00:01:54.060> say<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.299> us<00:01:54.539> on<00:01:54.689> a<00:01:54.720> regular<00:01:54.869> basis<00:01:55.530> the

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
people say to us on a regular basis the

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.620 
people say to us on a regular basis the
least<00:01:55.920> dogs<00:01:56.130> work<00:01:56.369> in<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.640> fields<00:01:57.030> well<00:01:57.270> this

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
least dogs work in the fields well this

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:58.940 
least dogs work in the fields well this
is<00:01:57.720> a<00:01:57.750> little<00:01:57.899> panic<00:01:58.289> so<00:01:58.409> it's<00:01:58.560> not<00:01:58.649> really<00:01:58.710> a

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
is a little panic so it's not really a

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.940 
is a little panic so it's not really a
good<00:01:59.070> example<00:01:59.640> I<00:01:59.789> dog<00:02:00.780> basically<00:02:01.439> do<00:02:01.679> all<00:02:01.710> that

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
good example I dog basically do all that

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.620 
good example I dog basically do all that
I<00:02:02.039> don't<00:02:02.220> run<00:02:02.369> any<00:02:02.580> copies<00:02:02.939> copies<00:02:03.360> of<00:02:03.479> the

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
I don't run any copies copies of the

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.210 
I don't run any copies copies of the
place<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:03.899> I<00:02:04.200> think<00:02:04.380> they're<00:02:04.470> good<00:02:04.619> dogs<00:02:04.799> I

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
place and I think they're good dogs I

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.399 
place and I think they're good dogs I
just<00:02:05.939> run<00:02:06.149> kelpies<00:02:06.509> because<00:02:06.659> I<00:02:06.750> like<00:02:06.960> them<00:02:07.229> I

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
just run kelpies because I like them I

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.800 
just run kelpies because I like them I
find<00:02:08.399> they<00:02:08.489> have<00:02:08.550> good<00:02:08.729> benefits<00:02:08.910> I<00:02:09.420> use<00:02:09.569> most

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
find they have good benefits I use most

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.330 
find they have good benefits I use most
of<00:02:09.989> mine<00:02:10.140> in<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.380> yards<00:02:10.769> but<00:02:10.950> they'll<00:02:11.099> gather

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
of mine in the yards but they'll gather

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.780 
of mine in the yards but they'll gather

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
big fields no problem at all certainly

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:15.920 
big fields no problem at all certainly
certainly<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.330> better<00:02:15.450> ones<00:02:15.660> and<00:02:15.840> they'll

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
certainly the better ones and they'll

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.390 
certainly the better ones and they'll
also<00:02:16.080> work<00:02:16.410> two<00:02:16.650> or<00:02:16.680> three<00:02:16.950> sheep<00:02:17.190> they<00:02:17.340> do

sheep trials as they call it so three
sheet<00:02:22.620> need<00:02:22.920> a<00:02:22.950> bit<00:02:23.130> handling<00:02:23.549> and<00:02:23.730> it's

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
sheet need a bit handling and it's

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.309 
sheet need a bit handling and it's
obvious<00:02:24.150> to<00:02:24.180> it<00:02:24.360> quite<00:02:24.569> comfortably<00:02:24.989> sort<00:02:25.260> of

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
obvious to it quite comfortably sort of

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.410 
obvious to it quite comfortably sort of
things<00:02:25.500> so<00:02:25.709> the<00:02:26.459> answer<00:02:26.819> to<00:02:26.850> that<00:02:26.970> is<00:02:27.090> the

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
things so the answer to that is the

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.490 
things so the answer to that is the
other<00:02:27.540> they<00:02:27.630> let<00:02:27.780> you<00:02:27.900> know<00:02:27.989> that<00:02:28.140> ain't<00:02:28.319> just

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
other they let you know that ain't just

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
work in the yard because that's what a

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.900 
work in the yard because that's what a
lot<00:02:29.880> of<00:02:29.940> people<00:02:30.000> think<00:02:31.880> they're<00:02:32.880> just

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
lot of people think they're just

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:43.440 
lot of people think they're just
basically<00:02:33.450> all<00:02:33.690> round<00:02:33.959> dogs<00:02:34.260> full<00:02:34.560> stop
