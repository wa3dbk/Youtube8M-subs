into<00:00:28.260> two<00:00:28.500> separate<00:00:28.859> bowls<00:00:29.039> then<00:00:29.580> we<00:00:29.670> want<00:00:29.849> to

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
into two separate bowls then we want to

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.220 
into two separate bowls then we want to
beat<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.150> yolks<00:00:30.330> with<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.660> whisk<00:00:30.869> until

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
beat the yolks with the whisk until

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:39.380 
beat the yolks with the whisk until
they're<00:00:31.320> light<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:31.740> color<00:00:31.949> in<00:00:32.160> texture<00:00:38.390> now

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
they're light and color in texture now

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.250 
they're light and color in texture now
when<00:00:39.510> they<00:00:39.600> start<00:00:39.809> getting<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:40.079> that<00:00:40.200> stage

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
when they start getting to that stage

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.319 
when they start getting to that stage
what<00:00:40.829> we<00:00:40.920> call<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.219> ribbon<00:00:41.520> stage<00:00:41.820> which<00:00:42.180> all

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
what we call the ribbon stage which all

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.340 
what we call the ribbon stage which all
that<00:00:42.480> means<00:00:42.629> is<00:00:42.750> that<00:00:42.780> when<00:00:42.989> you<00:00:43.020> think<00:00:43.110> the

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
that means is that when you think the

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.020 
that means is that when you think the
yolks<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.710> lift<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.100> whisk<00:00:44.250> up<00:00:44.520> they<00:00:44.910> all

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
yolks and lift the whisk up they all

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.330 
yolks and lift the whisk up they all
fall<00:00:45.239> down<00:00:45.270> in<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.570> ribbon<00:00:49.010> and<00:00:50.010> that<00:00:50.160> means

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
fall down in a ribbon and that means

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.889 
fall down in a ribbon and that means
we're<00:00:50.460> ready<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.730> add<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.940> sugar<00:00:51.090> so<00:00:51.780> we're

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
we're ready to add the sugar so we're

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:59.200 
we're ready to add the sugar so we're
gonna<00:00:51.989> slowly<00:00:52.350> add<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.710> 1/3<00:00:53.160> cup<00:00:53.370> of<00:00:53.399> sugar

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.639 

and<00:01:00.210> after<00:01:00.359> whisking<00:01:00.840> for<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:01.079> while<00:01:01.289> yolks

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
and after whisking for a while yolks

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.910 
and after whisking for a while yolks
will<00:01:01.859> look<00:01:01.980> like<00:01:02.129> this<00:01:03.710> when<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.799> sugar

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
will look like this when the sugar

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.320 
will look like this when the sugar
crystals<00:01:05.400> have<00:01:05.519> dissolved<00:01:05.820> that<00:01:06.060> means<00:01:06.210> it's

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
crystals have dissolved that means it's

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.940 
crystals have dissolved that means it's
time<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.630> add<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.750> liquid<00:01:06.990> so<00:01:07.619> that's<00:01:07.770> 2<00:01:07.920> cups

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
time to add the liquid so that's 2 cups

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:14.450 
time to add the liquid so that's 2 cups
of<00:01:08.250> whole<00:01:08.400> milk<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:12.830> the<00:01:13.830> 1<00:01:14.010> cup<00:01:14.189> of<00:01:14.220> heavy

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
of whole milk and the 1 cup of heavy

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:23.570 
of whole milk and the 1 cup of heavy
cream<00:01:21.470> now<00:01:22.470> we're<00:01:22.619> gonna<00:01:22.710> add<00:01:22.830> 1<00:01:23.040> teaspoon<00:01:23.070> of

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
cream now we're gonna add 1 teaspoon of

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.429 
cream now we're gonna add 1 teaspoon of
freshly<00:01:23.790> grated<00:01:24.090> nutmeg<00:01:24.270> now<00:01:24.930> fresh<00:01:25.170> agreed

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
freshly grated nutmeg now fresh agreed

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.960 
freshly grated nutmeg now fresh agreed
it<00:01:25.560> really<00:01:25.799> makes<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:26.040> difference<00:01:26.070> here<00:01:26.610> on<00:01:26.790> one

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
it really makes a difference here on one

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.460 
it really makes a difference here on one
of<00:01:27.000> these<00:01:27.119> micro-planes<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:27.840> takes<00:01:27.990> about<00:01:28.080> 20

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
of these micro-planes it takes about 20

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:35.210 
of these micro-planes it takes about 20
grades<00:01:33.259> and<00:01:34.259> then<00:01:34.380> we<00:01:34.470> add<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.710> three<00:01:34.920> ounces

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
grades and then we add the three ounces

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:41.600 
grades and then we add the three ounces
of<00:01:35.280> good<00:01:35.490> old<00:01:35.640> Kentucky<00:01:36.090> Bourbon<00:01:40.340> now<00:01:41.340> we<00:01:41.430> want

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.830 
little bit of fat still on it the egg
weights<00:01:50.700> wouldn't<00:01:50.939> actually<00:01:51.030> foam<00:01:51.390> up<00:01:51.570> on<00:01:51.720> us

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
weights wouldn't actually foam up on us

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.240 
weights wouldn't actually foam up on us
so<00:01:52.229> we're<00:01:52.320> gonna<00:01:52.409> whip<00:01:52.619> these<00:01:52.799> up<00:01:52.829> until<00:01:53.070> they

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
so we're gonna whip these up until they

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.649 
so we're gonna whip these up until they
form<00:01:53.490> soft<00:01:53.729> peaks<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.299> I'll<00:01:54.390> show<00:01:54.479> you<00:01:54.570> what

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
form soft peaks and I'll show you what

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:00.370 
form soft peaks and I'll show you what
that<00:01:54.689> looks<00:01:54.960> like

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.749 

well<00:02:01.380> we<00:02:01.469> mean<00:02:01.649> by<00:02:01.770> soft<00:02:02.009> peaks<00:02:02.340> is<00:02:02.520> that<00:02:02.670> when

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
well we mean by soft peaks is that when

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.670 
well we mean by soft peaks is that when
the<00:02:02.850> whisk<00:02:03.000> is<00:02:03.149> lifted<00:02:03.540> straight<00:02:03.810> up<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.439> foam

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
the whisk is lifted straight up the foam

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.380 
the whisk is lifted straight up the foam
kind<00:02:04.829> of<00:02:04.950> falls<00:02:05.130> over<00:02:05.490> then<00:02:05.939> this<00:02:06.180> is<00:02:06.329> the

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
kind of falls over then this is the

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.550 
kind of falls over then this is the
point<00:02:06.540> where<00:02:06.750> we<00:02:06.840> want<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:07.049> add<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.259> remaining

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
point where we want to add the remaining

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.400 
point where we want to add the remaining
1<00:02:07.829> tablespoon<00:02:08.310> of<00:02:08.340> sugar<00:02:12.110> then<00:02:13.110> we<00:02:13.200> want<00:02:13.349> to

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
1 tablespoon of sugar then we want to

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:21.280 
1 tablespoon of sugar then we want to
beat<00:02:13.530> this<00:02:13.650> until<00:02:13.950> it<00:02:14.010> forms<00:02:14.280> stiff<00:02:14.430> peaks

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.869 

that<00:02:22.290> looks<00:02:22.440> like<00:02:22.590> stiff<00:02:22.800> peaks<00:02:23.069> to<00:02:23.220> me<00:02:23.340> then

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879 
that looks like stiff peaks to me then

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:25.309 
that looks like stiff peaks to me then
we<00:02:23.970> want<00:02:24.150> to<00:02:24.209> take<00:02:24.330> this<00:02:24.450> foam<00:02:24.750> and<00:02:25.020> gently

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
we want to take this foam and gently

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.380 
we want to take this foam and gently
fold<00:02:25.349> it<00:02:25.709> into<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:25.980> eggnog<00:02:26.190> mixture<00:02:26.730> you<00:02:27.270> like

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
fold it into the eggnog mixture you like

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.270 
fold it into the eggnog mixture you like
the<00:02:27.480> green<00:02:27.599> special<00:02:27.989> the<00:02:28.709> reason<00:02:28.980> we<00:02:29.040> want<00:02:29.220> to

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
the green special the reason we want to

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.740 
the green special the reason we want to
gently<00:02:29.580> fold<00:02:29.910> is<00:02:30.120> because<00:02:30.360> we<00:02:30.450> don't<00:02:30.569> want<00:02:30.690> to

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
gently fold is because we don't want to

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.000 
gently fold is because we don't want to
lose<00:02:30.900> all<00:02:31.050> those<00:02:31.230> air<00:02:31.440> bubbles<00:02:31.470> we<00:02:31.830> just

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
lose all those air bubbles we just

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.320 
lose all those air bubbles we just
created<00:02:32.280> and<00:02:32.580> when<00:02:32.760> we<00:02:32.849> finally<00:02:33.030> have<00:02:33.300> a

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
created and when we finally have a

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.119 
created and when we finally have a
homogeneous<00:02:33.840> mixture<00:02:33.989> we're<00:02:34.440> done<00:02:34.560> and<00:02:34.980> then

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129 
homogeneous mixture we're done and then

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:40.580 
homogeneous mixture we're done and then
we<00:02:35.220> just<00:02:35.370> pour<00:02:35.519> it<00:02:35.610> into<00:02:35.700> a<00:02:35.819> nice<00:02:35.970> glass<00:02:39.590> maybe

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
we just pour it into a nice glass maybe

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
we just pour it into a nice glass maybe
going<00:02:40.830> to<00:02:40.890> shoot<00:02:41.040> with<00:02:41.129> a<00:02:41.190> little<00:02:41.400> extra

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610

and talk about some of the major white

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.270 
and talk about some of the major white
grape<00:02:58.019> varietals<00:02:58.650> and<00:02:58.830> where<00:02:58.950> they<00:02:59.069> come<00:02:59.250> from

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
grape varietals and where they come from

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.040 
grape varietals and where they come from
something<00:02:59.970> very<00:03:00.150> important<00:03:00.510> to<00:03:00.569> understand

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
something very important to understand

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.600 
something very important to understand
is<00:03:01.170> that<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:01.409> coloring<00:03:01.739> grapes<00:03:02.099> is<00:03:02.370> found

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
is that the coloring grapes is found

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.290 
is that the coloring grapes is found
only<00:03:02.879> in<00:03:03.060> the<00:03:03.150> skin<00:03:03.599> did<00:03:04.050> you

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
only in the skin did you

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.150 
only in the skin did you
is<00:03:04.390> always<00:03:04.660> clear<00:03:05.110> so<00:03:05.260> while<00:03:05.470> red<00:03:05.740> grapes<00:03:05.950> can

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
is always clear so while red grapes can

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.460 
is always clear so while red grapes can
produce<00:03:06.310> red<00:03:06.730> rosy<00:03:07.240> and<00:03:07.510> white<00:03:07.690> wines<00:03:07.960> white

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
produce red rosy and white wines white

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:09.990 
produce red rosy and white wines white
grapes<00:03:08.740> can<00:03:08.950> only<00:03:09.070> produce<00:03:09.280> white<00:03:09.640> wines

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
grapes can only produce white wines

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.510 
grapes can only produce white wines
make<00:03:10.270> sense
