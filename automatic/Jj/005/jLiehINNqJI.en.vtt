00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.050
 Now we have a few hours left 

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:17.750
 time to spring 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:19.610
 nation price starts either 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.349
 us on the tribune and cake 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.279
 that brings what works or we against 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:24.830
 just a little bit by the stalls 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:25.730
 watch what is new and market like and 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.430
 maybe we'll take something nice too 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.720
 with home and hope that the 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.720
 relaxed and exciting 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.420
 Of course you have the most important question 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:43.070
 ever made the dressage stadium 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.109
 yes I have seen 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.430
 but just no bus tour because of that 

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:48.430
 I personally liked it very much 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.690
 ann-christin now on eight students 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:59.550
 So basically this evening 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.680
 I'm also mainly interested in that 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.690
 I have always been off the pitch 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.299
 interesting as the pros their horses 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:10.740
 we can prepare a print them 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:12.840
 at home working on sonja you see 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.119
 The same one has me in the square 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.210
 Do you want to go and want to go too? 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.170
 ride with ride here 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.880
 I have been here once before 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.080
 is often only hopefully once riding 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.080
 with the brother of ann-christin 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.720
 but if I ride sometime 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.979
 Of course it's a big dream 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.210
 but of course I always have to 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:33.789
 everything has to be right for the right horse 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.619
 You have to go there too 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:36.759
 have a good phase and have big ones 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.159
 to be able to ride animals 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:42.130
 but that is a very long way off yet 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:44.080
 long yes i think every one of us is dreaming 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.179
 to be allowed to ride him even if only 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.909
 For example, such an opening ceremony 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:50.590
 because pages is totally big event and 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:53.380
 Everything is broadcast on TV 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:56.200
 and it's just an honor to ride here 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:59.140
 to be allowed and it would be just nice cool 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.380
 maybe jump here too 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.380
 to be allowed 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:49.420
 we had a super thrill here 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.100
 the chio aachen and the many 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.480
 get impressions 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.630
 and with that we would be home now 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.630
 drive
