00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
bait effectively in a later series we'll

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.390 
bait effectively in a later series we'll
be<00:01:03.750> talking<00:01:03.900> about<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.619> techniques<00:01:05.070> of<00:01:05.220> how

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
be talking about the techniques of how

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.760 
be talking about the techniques of how
to<00:01:05.460> pin<00:01:05.820> on<00:01:06.000> different<00:01:06.570> types<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:06.960> bait<00:01:07.200> for

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
to pin on different types of bait for

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.710 
to pin on different types of bait for
this<00:01:07.920> for<00:01:08.490> this<00:01:08.520> let's<00:01:08.970> just<00:01:09.150> assume<00:01:09.420> that<00:01:09.600> we

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
this for this let's just assume that we

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.500 
this for this let's just assume that we

fishing that fate net to where swims

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.000 
fishing that fate net to where swims
naturally<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.990> best<00:01:46.200> way<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.409> do<00:01:46.620> that<00:01:46.770> is<00:01:46.830> to
