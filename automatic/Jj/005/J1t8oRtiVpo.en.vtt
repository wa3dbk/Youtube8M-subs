00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.580
 series that was born on the first 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.900
 playstation and this fight has experienced a 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.910
 first important turn during his 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.710
 arrival on playstation 2 with the addition 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.349
 quite advanced scenario and the 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.820
 creating a mythology this 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:28.800
 continuous evolution in ace combat 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.970
 assault horizon that has greatly 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.970
 inspired by the competition 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.980
 clearly inspired from the call of 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.429
 duty of the same confession of the studio project and 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.230
 6 

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:43.649
 this last episode puts forward the putting 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.000
 on stage a spectacular side that takes 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.100
 the shape of a system named close range 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.420
 salt 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.920
 the latter allows to get closer to a 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.510
 target as soon as a green circle appears 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.339
 around her pressing the 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.719
 slice buttons 

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:56.369
 we start to spin the train of his 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.989
 enemy and just keep it in 

00:00:56.369 --> 00:01:00.119
 his viewfinder to destroy him small to 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.579
 small either with machine guns or 

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:04.409
 using missiles if successful 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.060
 the planes go to pieces and the 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.090
 debris invade the screen which 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.080
 participate in this grandiose side of the game 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.000
 of course it is still possible 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.259
 to attack opponents from afar but 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.520
 planes will most often have to be 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:16.170
 destroyed in close combat 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.299
 which could annoy the fans of the 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.250
 first hour 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.899
 moreover the very arcade side of the title has 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.810
 tendency to take pleasure out of play 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:26.190
 especially in the driving 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.600
 despite all the rest remains nervous and 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.459
 some passages quickly rise 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.539
 the adrenaline 

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:32.729
 which is a little less the case when 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:33.929
 helicopter phases since these machines 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.119
 introduce a whole new style of 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:37.020
 gameplay 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.759
 the helicopter is moving very close to the 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.960
 So it's better to hide 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.150
 to avoid enemy shots 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.979
 very playable in internal view these phases 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.690
 remains problematic in cockpit view and 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:49.500
 outdoors because of slowdown 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.400
 action and lack of visibility 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.890
 fortunately ace bout assault horizon 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.390
 is catching up at its own pace and the 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.950
 fluidity of the game always places us at 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:02.280
 heart of the action the game tablecloth accuses 15
