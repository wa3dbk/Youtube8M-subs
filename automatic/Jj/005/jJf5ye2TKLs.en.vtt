00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:48.050 
few minor issues you see the alignment
here<00:02:37.890> see<00:02:38.890> the<00:02:39.070> alignment<00:02:44.970> here

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.520 

it<00:02:49.060> looks<00:02:49.300> like<00:02:49.510> I'm<00:02:49.840> off<00:02:50.820> two<00:02:51.820> points<00:02:52.530> but

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
it looks like I'm off two points but

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.580 
it looks like I'm off two points but
when<00:02:53.740> I<00:02:53.770> measure<00:02:54.190> it<00:02:54.510> it's<00:02:55.510> dead<00:02:55.930> on<00:02:56.110> both

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590
