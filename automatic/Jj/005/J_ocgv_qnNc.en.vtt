00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 great you went to my channel on not 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.710
 quite aware of who I give a little 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.559
 I will explain this in the eleventh year and 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.679
 soul not faith play tanks i played in 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.900
 tank played played played watched vidos 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.400
 on tanks and at some point I 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.140
 I realized that I do not agree with the fact that 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.890
 promote some popular 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.630
 water-makers 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.900
 I wanted to somehow influence the situation 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.090
 but the options to make the video itself, I do not 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.890
 considered so as this computer 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.550
 the moment the tension coped with the game on 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.430
 minimum wages 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.500
 not to mention the pier video recording but 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.200
 passed a couple of years more powerful appeared 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.360
 comp and around the fall of the 13th year I 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.340
 calenders went trembling where afterwards 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.910
 I was offered to make a video for the channel 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.399
 the project made 96 vidos for them 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.100
 Basically, here is the link to this playlist. 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.570
 you can see what I started on 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.899
 I got fans on this channel 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.030
 who liked what I do and me 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.469
 increasingly began to offer to raise their 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.660
 own channel which i have in 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.969
 principle was already created and was on it 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.210
 few fan species but serious 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.330
 they called it was difficult the next 14 years I 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.590
 seriously engaged in the development of its channel 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.840
 main directions to the tank 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.500
 Subjects have become vidos on German super 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.210
 heavy Chinese cars and light tanks 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.310
 I try to emphasize in my vidos 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.610
 on rush tactics promoting active 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.920
 the game also highlight the training part and 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.250
 I try to tell in detail about small ones 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.189
 tricks and nuances for less skill 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.740
 players or novices to see my 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.930
 any video of them at least some sort of 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.450
 part of the information the viewer remembered and 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.310
 helped him in battle 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.890
