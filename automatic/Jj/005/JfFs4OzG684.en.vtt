here we go guys I'm pretty much going to
show<00:01:05.280> you<00:01:05.369> how<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.519> do<00:01:05.700> this<00:01:05.850> obviously<00:01:06.240> I've

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
show you how to do this obviously I've

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.570 
show you how to do this obviously I've
got<00:01:06.689> a<00:01:06.720> mine<00:01:06.930> down<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:07.170> am<00:01:07.380> on<00:01:07.530> creative<00:01:07.920> so<00:01:08.460> it's

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
got a mine down I am on creative so it's

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.640 
got a mine down I am on creative so it's
perfectly<00:01:08.939> fine<00:01:09.150> mine<00:01:09.960> down<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.439> bottom

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
perfectly fine mine down to the bottom

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.469 
perfectly fine mine down to the bottom
of<00:01:10.710> bedrock<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.460> can<00:01:11.610> do<00:01:11.729> this<00:01:11.939> or<00:01:12.119> obviously

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
of bedrock you can do this or obviously

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.260 
of bedrock you can do this or obviously
you<00:01:12.720> can<00:01:12.930> do<00:01:13.110> it<00:01:13.229> on<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.369> land<00:01:14.610> or<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:14.939> can<00:01:15.150> do

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
you can do it on the land or you can do

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.760 
you can do it on the land or you can do
but<00:01:15.450> I<00:01:15.509> think<00:01:15.689> bedrock<00:01:16.380> would<00:01:16.500> be<00:01:16.590> best

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
but I think bedrock would be best

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.350 
but I think bedrock would be best
because<00:01:16.920> obviously<00:01:17.159> it<00:01:17.820> could<00:01:18.000> be<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.119> cave

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
because obviously it could be a cave

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.789 
because obviously it could be a cave
system<00:01:18.600> at<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:18.960> end<00:01:19.049> of<00:01:19.170> this<00:01:19.229> that<00:01:19.500> I<00:01:19.530> want<00:01:19.740> to

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
system at the end of this that I want to

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.710 
system at the end of this that I want to
use<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.220> stuff<00:01:20.880> like<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.150> so<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.509> reason

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
use and stuff like that so the reason

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.249 
use and stuff like that so the reason
why<00:01:21.810> I'm<00:01:21.900> doing<00:01:21.930> it<00:01:22.200> through<00:01:22.409> bedrock<00:01:24.200> okay<00:01:25.200> so

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
why I'm doing it through bedrock okay so

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.990 
why I'm doing it through bedrock okay so
if<00:01:25.500> it<00:01:25.619> bedrock<00:01:26.040> so<00:01:26.430> what<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:26.729> want<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:26.909> do

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
if it bedrock so what you want to do

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.109 
if it bedrock so what you want to do
from<00:01:27.180> here<00:01:27.330> guys<00:01:27.540> is<00:01:27.840> you<00:01:28.049> want<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.259> build<00:01:28.619> and

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
glitch so as you can see here you can

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.260 
glitch so as you can see here you can
see<00:01:55.470> around<00:01:55.680> there's<00:01:56.369> lots<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:56.969> lots<00:01:57.060> of

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.609 
see around there's lots and lots of
stuff<00:01:57.450> there's<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.689> few<00:01:57.869> diamonds<00:01:58.079> over<00:01:58.469> there

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
stuff there's a few diamonds over there

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.280 
stuff there's a few diamonds over there
I'm<00:01:59.250> just<00:01:59.460> pointing<00:01:59.579> you<00:01:59.820> to<00:02:00.000> now<00:02:00.290> subsidies

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
I'm just pointing you to now subsidies

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.810 
I'm just pointing you to now subsidies
glitch<00:02:01.560> does<00:02:01.860> work<00:02:02.070> it's<00:02:02.340> a<00:02:02.430> very<00:02:02.610> simple

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
glitch does work it's a very simple

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.700 
glitch does work it's a very simple
glitch<00:02:03.210> doesn't<00:02:03.600> get<00:02:03.810> you<00:02:03.869> killed<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:04.409> I

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
glitch doesn't get you killed and I

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.399 
glitch doesn't get you killed and I
think<00:02:05.070> that<00:02:05.880> is<00:02:06.060> a<00:02:06.180> Bandhan<00:02:06.869> mine<00:02:07.079> shaft

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
think that is a Bandhan mine shaft

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.660 
think that is a Bandhan mine shaft
system<00:02:08.090> there<00:02:09.090> and<00:02:09.390> I<00:02:09.989> do<00:02:10.140> believe<00:02:10.679> that<00:02:11.370> could

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
system there and I do believe that could

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.320 
system there and I do believe that could
be<00:02:11.879> some<00:02:12.300> mob<00:02:12.569> spawners

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
be some mob spawners

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.450 
be some mob spawners
I<00:02:13.360> do<00:02:14.230> believe<00:02:14.500> that<00:02:14.530> is<00:02:14.800> a<00:02:14.830> mob<00:02:15.040> spawn<00:02:15.280> over

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
I do believe that is a mob spawn over

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.250 
I do believe that is a mob spawn over
there<00:02:15.700> so<00:02:16.180> you<00:02:16.270> have<00:02:16.360> very<00:02:16.540> simple<00:02:16.810> guys<00:02:17.110> you

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
there so you have very simple guys you

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.620 
there so you have very simple guys you
can<00:02:17.380> obviously<00:02:17.590> see<00:02:17.830> if<00:02:18.700> you<00:02:18.970> got<00:02:19.120> into<00:02:19.390> a<00:02:19.420> new

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
can obviously see if you got into a new

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.030 
can obviously see if you got into a new
world<00:02:19.810> and<00:02:20.140> obviously<00:02:20.200> you're<00:02:20.590> going<00:02:20.770> through

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
world and obviously you're going through

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.710 
world and obviously you're going through
it<00:02:21.160> a<00:02:21.190> little<00:02:21.340> bit<00:02:21.520> more<00:02:21.730> as<00:02:21.880> you<00:02:22.390> want<00:02:22.570> to<00:02:22.630> know

it a little bit more as you want to know

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.780 
it a little bit more as you want to know
if<00:02:22.900> it's<00:02:23.020> a<00:02:23.140> good<00:02:23.320> seed<00:02:23.590> or<00:02:23.740> not<00:02:23.920> and<00:02:24.550> obviously

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
if it's a good seed or not and obviously

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.970 
if it's a good seed or not and obviously

you gather a few items and then do the

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:30.870 
you gather a few items and then do the
x-ray<00:02:30.010> glitch<00:02:30.250> but<00:02:30.430> it's<00:02:30.520> simple<00:02:30.730> as<00:02:30.790> this

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
x-ray glitch but it's simple as this
