00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
this is about to be the Kapiti game so I

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.530 
this is about to be the Kapiti game so I
think<00:01:04.460> that's<00:01:04.640> why<00:01:04.850> they<00:01:05.000> turned<00:01:05.059> off<00:01:05.479> the

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
think that's why they turned off the

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.539 
think that's why they turned off the
chat<00:01:06.110> thing<00:01:06.320> or<00:01:06.500> they<00:01:06.890> won't<00:01:07.130> let<00:01:07.250> it<00:01:07.430> go

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 
chat thing or they won't let it go

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:10.560 
chat thing or they won't let it go
through<00:01:07.880> so<00:01:08.689> that's<00:01:08.990> my<00:01:09.260> theory<00:01:09.530> on<00:01:09.680> it<00:01:09.890> and

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
through so that's my theory on it and

it's going to take forever to upload the
daily<00:01:36.890> video<00:01:37.130> that's<00:01:37.610> what<00:01:37.729> i'm<00:01:37.790> doing<00:01:37.939> this

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
daily video that's what i'm doing this

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.910 
daily video that's what i'm doing this
live<00:01:38.210> set<00:01:38.479> you<00:01:38.720> get<00:01:38.869> this<00:01:39.020> immediately<00:01:39.560> and

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
live set you get this immediately and

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.160 
live set you get this immediately and
it's<00:01:40.040> not<00:01:40.220> like<00:01:40.400> a<00:01:40.430> major<00:01:40.670> video<00:01:41.030> video<00:01:41.420> so<00:01:42.140> i

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
it's not like a major video video so i

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.200 
it's not like a major video video so i
guess<00:01:42.590> it's<00:01:42.799> fine<00:01:42.950> if<00:01:43.100> it's<00:01:43.220> live<00:01:43.399> so<00:01:43.939> just

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
guess it's fine if it's live so just

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.190 
guess it's fine if it's live so just
want<00:01:44.390> to<00:01:44.450> let<00:01:44.570> you<00:01:44.689> guys<00:01:44.780> know<00:01:44.990> because

want to let you guys know because

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.109 
want to let you guys know because

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
apparently it's gonna be a panic and

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:49.270 
apparently it's gonna be a panic and
stuff<00:01:47.329> like<00:01:47.930> I<00:01:48.170> tried<00:01:48.409> reloading<00:01:48.710> page<00:01:49.070> and

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
stuff like I tried reloading page and

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.109 
stuff like I tried reloading page and
everything<00:01:49.640> and<00:01:50.170> yeah<00:01:51.170> so<00:01:51.740> don't<00:01:52.220> panic<00:01:52.880> just

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
everything and yeah so don't panic just

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.020 
everything and yeah so don't panic just
know<00:01:53.570> that<00:01:53.810> something<00:01:54.280> went<00:01:55.280> wrong<00:01:55.549> with<00:01:55.790> in

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
know that something went wrong with in

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.050 
know that something went wrong with in
AJ<00:01:56.509> and<00:01:56.719> people<00:01:57.229> were<00:01:57.380> able<00:01:57.590> to<00:01:57.920> swear<00:01:58.250> so

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
AJ and people were able to swear so

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.840 
AJ and people were able to swear so
that's<00:01:59.299> why<00:01:59.479> I'm<00:01:59.659> guessing<00:02:00.110> a<00:02:00.229> to<00:02:00.290> turn<00:02:00.560> it<00:02:00.680> off

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
that's why I'm guessing a to turn it off

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.550 
that's why I'm guessing a to turn it off
like<00:02:01.850> you<00:02:01.880> and<00:02:02.090> reloading<00:02:02.509> it<00:02:02.780> won't<00:02:02.990> help<00:02:03.350> you

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
that start up again before this this has

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.370 
that start up again before this this has
happened<00:02:56.330> earlier<00:02:56.690> this<00:02:56.720> has<00:02:56.960> happened<00:02:57.290> like

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
happened earlier this has happened like

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.530 
happened earlier this has happened like
less<00:02:57.740> than<00:02:57.920> a<00:02:58.040> year<00:02:58.310> ago<00:02:58.430> where<00:02:59.060> people<00:02:59.450> were

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
less than a year ago where people were

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.180 
less than a year ago where people were
able<00:02:59.750> to<00:03:00.020> say<00:03:00.140> to<00:03:00.200> the<00:03:00.350> f-word<00:03:00.740> and<00:03:00.920> sore<00:03:01.160> and

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
not Bend right there and then basically

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.020 
not Bend right there and then basically
they're<00:03:03.920> able<00:03:04.040> to<00:03:04.250> do<00:03:04.430> that<00:03:04.580> for<00:03:04.730> a<00:03:04.790> few<00:03:04.880> days

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
like a day I'm get guessing and then AJ

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.060 
like a day I'm get guessing and then AJ
found<00:03:08.180> out<00:03:08.330> and<00:03:08.510> so<00:03:08.690> then<00:03:08.870> after<00:03:09.200> they<00:03:09.710> fixed

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
found out and so then after they fixed

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.790 
found out and so then after they fixed
it<00:03:10.130> then<00:03:10.640> they<00:03:11.020> suspended<00:03:12.020> everyone<00:03:12.560> who's
