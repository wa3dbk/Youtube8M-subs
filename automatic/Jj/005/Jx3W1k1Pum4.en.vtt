gameplay<00:02:43.150> engine<00:02:43.870> you<00:02:44.530> know<00:02:44.710> area<00:02:45.310> as<00:02:45.910> far<00:02:46.210> as

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
gameplay engine you know area as far as

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.060

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
connecting the guys to the feel that I

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.190 
connecting the guys to the feel that I
just<00:02:48.490> don't<00:02:48.910> really<00:02:49.090> feel<00:02:49.240> like<00:02:49.450> that<00:02:49.780> made<00:02:49.990> me

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
just don't really feel like that made me

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.260 
just don't really feel like that made me
address<00:02:50.560> and<00:02:50.770> tell<00:02:50.950> the<00:02:51.070> next<00:02:51.340> gen<00:02:51.550> you<00:02:52.150> know

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270
