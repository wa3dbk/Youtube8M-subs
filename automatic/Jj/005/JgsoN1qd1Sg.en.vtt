00:00:03.359 --> 00:00:07.479
 and we have to take advantage of the mistakes 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.130
 that I committed profanity we have taken advantage of 

00:00:07.479 --> 00:00:11.350
 the pains 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.840
 we were forceful in every play and that 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:15.730
 allows us three more units in which 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.710
 allows us the book where we are a 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.450
 very important victory a little bit 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.650
 with which we are losing and down and 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:23.170
 good as if a difference 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.430
 important we remain in your home court 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.800
 visited the points and well I think it 's 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.060
 a blunt victory could have 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.949
 been much more extensive but good is very 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.140
 important that you follow nois and follow 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:34.269
 climbing is remarkable the truth that is 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.100
 He ran quite a visitor to us 

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:37.749
 going very well he has for the 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.699
 attitude not the delivery that we leave in 

00:00:37.749 --> 00:00:41.979
 each party did a great game 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:43.389
 against a rival we handle the ball 

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:45.760
 we took advantage of the option of goal that were 

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:47.859
 important and the truth that is read by 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.410
 this victory not yes yes I think that 

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:52.420
 we started pretty well 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.270
 they did not come four times they made us 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:59.020
 four goals mistakes our backs without 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:01.330
 nothing that if working and what to take out 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.010
 forward we know we have equipment to 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.560
 do it you have to keep working for 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.940
 Unlike me that my first time 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.100
 second time although they did have some 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:12.220
 cons but we were not doing well 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:15.550
 paraditos but good they were 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:18.100
 they had a lot of much solvency in 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.630
 the defensive part and what we a 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.640
 final stretch now end of the 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.759
 results results 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.680
 I can not conceive that an archer of 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:28.330
 the hierarchy of more in four parties 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.970
 do not aggravate the four minus four 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.500
 matches then I do not know if it's been 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.810
 constant I do not want to believe that he has never 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.490
 won and bad proposed to soccer of 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.229
 all ways send results hopefully 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.619
 that the technician who comes does it better 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:40.619
 soon 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.880
 and very important because we need the 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:51.100
 points that are below the table 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.869
 we want more and good we are going to work 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.040
 every day to continue like this until the 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.350
 going through a good time 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.030
 in this phase of the canterazo I follow a 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.100
 very cool moment for the team 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.990
 personally and good happy about that 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.210
 what do you tell me about the performance when 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.130
 they saw more complicated match 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.869
 moments when it's gone now 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.720
 to find the tie but now only 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.530
 we could call goals and I think there 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.970
 won a match 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.180
 the difference is just from the party the 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.250
 pri to the vice just or not but we won 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.569
 They are three points as important as 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.880
 of the happy party figure 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.739
 thank you very much and this motivates me to continue 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.959
 improving every day to continue working more 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.550
 also with goals is important and always 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.709
 by a forward he follows very 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.980
 he was looking for it and today he 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.980
 medium
