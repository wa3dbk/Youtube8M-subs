00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:06.120
 how about friends in this 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:09.540
 opportunity we are with a video of how 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.390
 have root access at the factory 12 m away 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.820
 601 

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:15.950
 first of all I would like to apologize 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:19.780
 maybe because of the video quality that is not 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:22.080
 very good but I do not have a camera 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:24.580
 video that I have a good resolution 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.620
 more although the video was made more filmed 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.260
 at night 

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.730
 good without further ado let's go 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.240
 what we need to have access 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.830
 root illiterate in 1601 first that 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:39.000
 we do not need the program 'no and ruth 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:41.920
 what is this 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.649
 it issues drivers 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.739
 these two files are installed in the 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:49.930
 pc I'm going to leave the download link 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.809
 in description of the video once 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:56.399
 having these two install them virus 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:56.399
 it is installed like any other program 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.650
 once installed from root we should 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:04.140
 open it and we have to have a connection 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.610
 to the internet so that the program can 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.490
 download all the add-ons that 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.890
 need 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.990
 once all the 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.920
 complements we proceed to use what 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.920
 what is coming is the cable 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:23.030
 on the tablet 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:26.120
 let's go in what solutions 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:29.390
 development you probably do not 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:31.880
 have active so they will have to 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:36.010
 activate it 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.840
 we go into what is adjustments 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.660
 we go to the last part that starts 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.310
 information option of the tablet and 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:46.530
 we press repeatedly in what 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.530
 says compilation number 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.430
 squeeze until I tell you that you 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.120
 you are already developers once you know 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.930
 the message 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:02:01.180
 we go into development options 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.180
 and we mark usb debugging 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.700
 for a dialog should 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:09.300
 to accept 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:14.030
 we went to the main menu and 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.030
 we proceed to connect the usb cable 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.989
 in our favour 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.700
 Once connected we hope not 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.110
 know there will not be a dialog box 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.660
 with the questions and we in case 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.920
 we allow which is not yet seen 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:44.350
 we mark a tab that says allow 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.350
 always and we accept 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:54.499
 we wait a few moments 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:54.499
 kevin rudd we recognize the cable 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.710
 how can you see what I'm getting to know 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:23.530
 in my case as it is already surrounded by going to 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:26.050
 exit root option 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.420
 in your case it will not happen to 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:31.819
 this tab this window but it's going to 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:34.849
 stay in the previous one and a part 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:38.659
 lower right in green as they go 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:40.760
 to point out that you folder in this 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:43.310
 button and wait for the team to 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:46.599
 restart I'm going to proceed to be the king 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:50.860
 rod so they see cross tracking is 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:53.520
 completely real 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.520
 we wait 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:02.470
 he fablet is going to restart once 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.470
 is in reboot 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.030
 this king is not going to take his time like this 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.140
 that they have to have a lot of patience 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.800
 as you can see it is already beginning 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.800
 turn on 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:22.500
 but I repeat it's going to take 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.500
 so a lot of patience let's wait 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:48.099
 good in this case of ruth points us 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.830
 your 60 complete 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:59.370
 does not mean that the procedure of 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:02.510
 root has already been completed 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.510
 let's go to the fable 

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:10.370
 as you can see 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.370
 is finishing lighting 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.530
 we wait 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:28.560
 and now let's move on to review and this 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:28.560
 is to create it from the club 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:47.560
 in a the checkbook application rut 

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:49.720
 we leave on the verify button 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:53.310
 and it indicates us 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.310
 I've been roque 

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:57.880
 why our device is already 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.880
 rooted 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.190
 until the superuser application 

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:08.060
 you can see is in Chinese 

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:14.760
 but it's very easy to use when 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.760
 you make a root application 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:21.099
 because you need root access forgiveness 

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:24.080
 this application is super user is going 

00:06:21.099 --> 00:06:26.659
 to ask that you grant permission 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:28.400
 press first on a box to 

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:31.490
 I'm not going to ask you there, it's going to 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:33.530
 mark with a check and then press 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:35.979
 in the option of the right side always 

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:39.849
 who want to give permission to the application 

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:42.550
 always right side option 

00:06:39.849 --> 00:06:44.950
 good friends this has been all 

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:47.049
 in this ruth herrera video manufactured 

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:50.540
 in 1601 

00:06:47.049 --> 00:06:52.400
 later I will be 

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:55.310
 we will not be uploading videos of how 

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:57.350
 change the virtual keys and how 

00:06:55.310 --> 00:07:01.400
 change also the design of the icons 

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:03.260
 of the tablet s m-601 to give it a 

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:06.360
 appearance similar to what it comes to be 

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:07.949
 black android 

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:09.510
 I hope the video was of his 

00:07:07.949 --> 00:07:13.460
 liking 

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:13.460
 until next time thanks
