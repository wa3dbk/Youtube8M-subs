 Thanks to slap together an enemy fortress per pack reconnaissance prepared utilizing a low deuthae 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.940

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:10.040
 o There are some irritating parts when I'm very tired. 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:14.270
 So this is the next passive Oracle. 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:19.580

 It's also a hero.
