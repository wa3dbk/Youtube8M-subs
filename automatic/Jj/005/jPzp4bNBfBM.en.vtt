00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
the refrigerator and the next time you

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.520 
the refrigerator and the next time you
do<00:01:59.430> one<00:01:59.729> jar<00:02:00.000> two<00:02:00.390> jars<00:02:00.630> you<00:02:00.930> just<00:02:01.049> use<00:02:01.290> that

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
do one jar two jars you just use that

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.600 
do one jar two jars you just use that
instead<00:02:02.250> of<00:02:02.520> making<00:02:02.759> another<00:02:03.000> batch<00:02:03.299> wow

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610

instead of making another batch wow
that's<00:02:05.610> a<00:02:05.729> really<00:02:05.909> clever<00:02:06.240> idea<00:02:06.420> this<00:02:06.990> is<00:02:07.049> it

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
that's a really clever idea this is it

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.240 
that's a really clever idea this is it
