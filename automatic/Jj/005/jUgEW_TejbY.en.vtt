00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:12.090
 Here you do not see in the forest it is about 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:16.020
 one staged a staged photo 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.000
 i have my model richie a bit 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.720
 moved there is an armchair 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.580
 old armchair an old lamp and me 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.859
 also want to show how interesting you are 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.529
 Taking photos makes the scene easy 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.349
 staged this scene could be for now 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.930
 many things stand for example for isolation 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.480
 for depression he sits here very much 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.460
 lost in thought in the forest 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.480
 You can talk about his life for that 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.620
 many different topics for example 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.690
 use 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.140
 it's also a bit older everything 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.879
 So 50s 60s look like this 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.100
 you stage a picture and of course 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.230
 is this picture with flashes 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.379
 I lit here as main 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.719
 not a system of lightning 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.170
 forma has and the main beam 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.550
 right on her and in the lamp 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.860
 of course I have a flash 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.290
 hides the lamp to the quasi 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.270
 light up and last but not least 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.369
 I'm a third behind the tree 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.170
 lightning now positions me for the 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.030
 will not use the first photos but 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.920
 later take to him 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.350
 maybe a nice hair and 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.540
 edges to give light here that this 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.369
 area is lit up nicely 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.479
 if that will be necessary I have to 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.720
 the exclamation when I work now 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.950
 first with these two flashes of in 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.329
 the lamp and the main light and will 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.689
 open iris I've photographed 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.770
 you blind 28 and become very much me 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.259
 photograph that means I have to be very 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.210
 far away and my perspective will also be 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.280
 I want to be very low 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.530
 from the forest floor with in the foreground 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.030
 have on it and I want to blur 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.040
 It's supposed to work its light cinema 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.670
 Give a look and achieve that just by 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.049
 tele with open end 28 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.430
 what else is there to say that 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.909
 I'll get ambient light around one to two 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.750
 dazzling under approved that will 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.590
 I now equal on photographs 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.149
 find out 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.549
 the white balance is on at the moment 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:08.039
 cloudy and I have to say 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.700
 I make it simple let's go yes I have 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.940
 me here now a very low position 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.310
 select 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.380
 I'm lying on the forest floor, so to speak 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.150
 a rubber mat under me with me 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.190
 do not get wet the bottom of the topic 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.380
 and it is very concerned at the moment and 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.410
 I would like to be based on this position 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.930
 a lot of the foliage with more in the 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.530
 picture take a nice deep around the picture 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.300
 to give 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.890
 I will now have different pictures 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.960
 make with different cutouts 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.690
 once a large section around 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:39.780
 as much as possible because to show that acts 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:44.100
 then lost a bit the model sits his 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:46.320
 lost in the forest but also a few 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.240
 close to that exactly with this 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.070
 can work to depth of field 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.620
 At the moment, only the two flashes are in 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.760
 operation in the lamp and the main 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.750
 light and I will also go into the 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.760
 switch to portrait format 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.810
 I can have a very nice one 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.700
 select section 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.670
 in the background you can see a bit 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.840
 from the forest but only a bit me 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.160
 I'll lighten that up a bit now 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.570
 the ambient light I use with the 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.850
 shutter time I'm working now 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.550
 worth a hundredth of a second 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.980
 go to 1 80 m and thus have one 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.810
 longer closing time and also something 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.550
 more ambient light on it I will 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.730
 but lower a bit 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:24.739
 a 60 and get more and more of that 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:28.890
 the ambient light on the picture 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:31.770
 more precise the position is good smells 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:34.070
 the direction of lightning is the head 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:36.360
 good and just look like that 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:38.340
 would you worry about the thought 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.170
 the sense of life you can do your sweater 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:44.040
 still a bit in the abdomen 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.980
 a few very many fold exactly and that 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:53.670
 put your hands on your knees 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:54.930
 very nice, yes that's a very nice one 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.810
 I'll just go now 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.880
 take a two photos without flash 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.769
 so that he loads the difference this 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.930
 photo for example world without flash light 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:06.320
 one recognizes him but also with 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:09.300
 suddenly he is much nicer 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:11.700
 illuminated so he is this time one 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:14.700
 choose as large a section as possible 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.290
 you also see a bit like the set 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.000
 it is built for you 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:22.229
 maybe very interesting if you like that 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.979
 if you like my photos like that 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:25.140
 look 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:25.450
 I have only two places in the moment 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.970
 1 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:30.010
 and these two places too 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.320
 low power I think I have 12 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.270
 30 o'clock set both at 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.130
 the lamp as well as the main light 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.990
 because the forest is very dark 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.490
 I do not have that much lightning power though 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.060
 I'm missing the light from a bit 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.350
 behind 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.570
 I would now have a third flash 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:47.170
 to accept and that stands behind the tree 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:49.600
 who also has only 1 32 performance and will 

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:51.180
 the model and the chair from the back 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.320
 so-called edges give light 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:57.310
 it flashes on , I go now 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:05:01.600
 get close to the picture with it 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:04.150
 see what happens there now you can see 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.740
 it very clear the shoulder and the 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.870
 Armchairs are from behind with one 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.940
 Provide light and bright room and lift 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.710
 This makes it very nice from the background 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.690
 and that's what you do 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.460
 so-called green light edges 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.170
 light culture light sanctifies anyway 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:20.650
 that's just called that serves 

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:23.560
 because the model of the dark 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.970
 background lift and the model still 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.160
 to miss an accent 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:31.570
 As I said, I say a lot 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:33.700
 it simply serves to ease the loneliness of 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.410
 demonstrating people in the chair and 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:38.020
 if I approach it then I have 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:40.360
 He had a very close to him 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:45.490
 beautiful depth of field and his look 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:47.620
 looks very intense, so pay attention 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:49.720
 that you as said on the 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:52.180
 ambient light pay attention it is very much now 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.320
 Sometimes I have gaps in the clouds 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.000
 clouds then the sun comes back 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.590
 through that he is a bit on 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.300
 display looks if we really in the 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:59.620
 underexposure since everything is correct 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.970
 exposed is because you have to a time 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:02.680
 little on the time 8 maxi 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:05.500
 shutter speed I am now doing eg 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.760
 125 and have relatively little 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.770
 ambient light that I must now again 

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:13.510
 reduce because clouds are raised 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:15.520
 I go to 180 now that must be 

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:16.870
 vary a bit now I see 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:19.960
 again a bit of background the 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:21.970
 trees and foliage and there you have to 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:24.040
 just make sure that you always 

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:26.409
 have a look at the closing time 

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:29.990
 and just keep reposting expensive 

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:31.729
 he has seen from the pictures 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:32.389
 hec that's not that complicated 

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:33.949
 is 

00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:36.560
 to take interesting pictures by 

00:06:33.949 --> 00:06:37.879
 the setup just has to be staged 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.939
 I think about it a bit 

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:42.050
 the clothes over the location 

00:06:39.939 --> 00:06:44.719
 maybe also about the accessories 

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:45.919
 about the props but if you like 

00:06:44.719 --> 00:06:48.680
 on the flea market there you can find 

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:50.120
 a lot of old armchairs old lamps and 

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.250
 if you are interested in such a time 

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:54.590
 then just build it for her 

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:56.120
 Have you seen it? 

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:59.259
 three flashes for a really 

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.259
 interesting exciting picture
