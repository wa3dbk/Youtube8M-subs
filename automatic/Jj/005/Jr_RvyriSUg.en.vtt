00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 hi friends if you do not want to 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.350
 your console kai something happened 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.630
 like that for her you will have a little bit 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.880
 overdo the problem of overheating this 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.509
 The eternal topic of the discussions of the owners 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:20.130
 any consoles whether it is x-box be it ps3 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:22.949
 and ps4 ps 5 6 7 8 9 10 and so on 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.199
 often new consoles fall into either 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.750
 the hands of children whose age is not 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.859
 enough brains to realize that behind the console 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.890
 need to follow 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.930
 either to baker pitécanthropes who 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.600
 used to sell your coffin 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.350
 mom's vacuum cleaner right there all a little 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.660
 more difficult 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.270
 it's summer now and the issue of overheating 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.190
 becomes a rib various overseas 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.980
 craftsmen very originally decides this 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.910
 problem but you do not be afraid with my 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:55.440
 recommendations will be simpler name 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:57.449
 idiotic console breathe the same 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.699
 the air that you have in the room so 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.370
 if you don't want her through 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.159
 year and a half died from the fact that clogged 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.250
 In a moment, with dust, we take a rag's teeth. 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.990
 vacuum cleaners we clean our room like 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.720
 and to you comes chick 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.360
 which you washed the whole month but 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.820
 my young asshole should not worry 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.250
 otter his room every day is not necessary 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.490
 just so that the dust was not in two layers 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.500
 it will be quite enough cooler you can 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.479
 clean so it's not a problem but 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.640
 you understand it is necessary to disassemble 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.570
 console I don't think anyone wants 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.939
 it can be made of the name 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.180
 understand that the freer she is 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:42.210
 the better the distance from the cooler to the wall 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:45.210
 or any other surface should be 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.610
 from 20 to 30 centimeters maximum 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:51.299
 check it is very simple to take a ruler 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:54.450
 do not put your hand if not blowing 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:57.390
 heat means it is worth what to close and 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.189
 it costs the more heated than 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.210
 the more it heats the more 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.299
 cooler works 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:06.210
 it means it makes noise louder and therefore 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.810
 there is a deterioration of thermal paste and other things 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.370
 other things 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.670
 and the bottom heats up the most 

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:14.490
 Consequently 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:17.069
 it is better to put it upright good 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.989
 sony made a great stand for this 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:22.140
 thereby completely solving this problem 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:25.160
 but I don’t really like when it’s worth 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.840
 vertically so I propose to do 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.270
 You can do a small stand 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.390
 absolutely nothing here is necessary 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:36.239
 include the inventor even from 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:39.090
 Four traffic jams personally I have it on 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:41.400
 two hard drives under the string clogged them 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.819
 porn paid kidding 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:47.190
 I have everything online in general, this is what 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:49.080
 very necessary between the bottom curling 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.860
 not much room for air and this 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.780
 very very important but personally i wouldn't 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.660
 advised to play for 15 hours in a row 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.540
 obviously a man who plays 15 hours 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:03.540
 successively poker self crap about 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.130
 prefix speak but still in hot 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.739
 days especially when you play 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:10.709
 hungry games like guitar battle and and 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:14.040
 so on I would recommend after hours 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:18.390
 all well there 8 put on standby 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:20.760
 20-30 minutes on or off at all but 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.950
 it's only if you play long 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:26.489
 a very long time if less 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:28.620
 absolutely not worth it all i want 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.180
 say that my advice is strictly 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.640
 recommendatory 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.250
 I do not impose them on anyone unless you 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.859
 follow them i don't think your 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.380
 console will break after a month she 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:43.470
 will break in a year I used to keep 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.790
 technique is much longer than this period of years 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.299
 so five six 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:50.670
 my example playstation 2 14 years old so 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:53.100
 I think that I am a man whose opinion 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.660
 something is usually curling 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.970
 It breaks the least of anyone's 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.720
 most of all for her is experiencing this law 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.760
 meanness 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.819
 so I would not advise her to cherish 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:05.910
 Approx but some councils still 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:08.569
 listen worth all thanks to the new 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.569
 meeting
