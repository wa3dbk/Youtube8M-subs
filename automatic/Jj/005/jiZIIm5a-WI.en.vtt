okay<00:01:40.429> so<00:01:41.429> I<00:01:41.460> foot<00:01:41.700> locked<00:01:41.909> up<00:01:42.119> it<00:01:42.899> was<00:01:43.049> pretty

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
okay so I foot locked up it was pretty

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.550 
okay so I foot locked up it was pretty
easy<00:01:44.240> except<00:01:45.240> now<00:01:45.450> my<00:01:45.630> hands<00:01:46.020> are<00:01:46.109> completely

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
easy except now my hands are completely

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.580 
easy except now my hands are completely
numb<00:01:47.840> doesn't<00:01:48.840> matter<00:01:49.020> what<00:01:49.140> kind<00:01:49.259> of<00:01:49.350> gloves

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
numb doesn't matter what kind of gloves

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.959 
numb doesn't matter what kind of gloves
you<00:01:49.710> have<00:01:49.859> on<00:01:50.039> just<00:01:50.369> doesn't<00:01:50.609> work<00:01:50.700> in<00:01:50.850> this

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:50.969 
you have on just doesn't work in this

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:56.889 
you have on just doesn't work in this
weather<00:01:51.149> ah<00:01:52.520> wasn't<00:01:53.520> that<00:01:53.700> hard<00:01:53.969> really<00:01:55.310> I

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
weather ah wasn't that hard really I

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:00.080 
weather ah wasn't that hard really I
think<00:01:57.899> a<00:01:58.020> longer<00:01:58.560> secret<00:01:59.340> weapon<00:01:59.789> would<00:01:59.939> be

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
think a longer secret weapon would be

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.870 
think a longer secret weapon would be
better<00:02:00.829> in<00:02:01.829> this<00:02:02.069> when<00:02:02.520> you're<00:02:02.640> doing<00:02:02.849> a

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
better in this when you're doing a

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.639 
better in this when you're doing a
double<00:02:03.179> rope<00:02:03.359> like<00:02:03.599> this<00:02:03.810> for<00:02:04.020> sure<00:02:04.200> it<00:02:04.530> would

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
double rope like this for sure it would

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.630 
double rope like this for sure it would
be<00:02:04.770> better<00:02:05.420> because<00:02:06.420> then<00:02:06.659> you<00:02:06.810> could<00:02:06.959> tie

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
be better because then you could tie

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.830 
be better because then you could tie
maybe<00:02:08.640> add<00:02:08.819> estelle<00:02:09.179> or<00:02:09.390> something<00:02:09.720> that

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
maybe add estelle or something that

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.930 
maybe add estelle or something that
would<00:02:09.929> slide<00:02:10.200> leisure<00:02:10.709> than<00:02:11.069> sway<00:02:11.370> vish<00:02:11.610> this

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
would slide leisure than sway vish this

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.530 
would slide leisure than sway vish this
worked<00:02:12.209> it<00:02:12.420> wasn't<00:02:12.660> that<00:02:12.720> difficult

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
worked it wasn't that difficult

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.030 
worked it wasn't that difficult
obviously<00:02:15.540> he<00:02:15.599> can't<00:02:15.750> do<00:02:15.900> it<00:02:16.019> fast<00:02:16.290> I<00:02:16.620> was<00:02:16.890> just

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
obviously he can't do it fast I was just

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.670 
obviously he can't do it fast I was just
doing<00:02:17.190> so<00:02:17.480> nice<00:02:18.480> solid<00:02:18.959> locks<00:02:19.170> didn't<00:02:19.530> miss<00:02:19.650> a

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
doing so nice solid locks didn't miss a

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.199 
doing so nice solid locks didn't miss a
lock<00:02:19.950> and<00:02:20.360> you<00:02:21.360> know<00:02:21.450> only<00:02:21.510> took<00:02:21.750> me<00:02:21.959> no<00:02:22.530> no<00:02:23.209> not

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
lock and you know only took me no no not
