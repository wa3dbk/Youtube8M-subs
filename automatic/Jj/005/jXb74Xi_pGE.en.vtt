demented<00:05:48.260> he's<00:05:48.770> more<00:05:49.039> twisted<00:05:49.820> when<00:05:50.419> Voss<00:05:50.630> is

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:50.660 
demented he's more twisted when Voss is

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:52.240 
demented he's more twisted when Voss is
just<00:05:50.990> like<00:05:51.110> a<00:05:51.139> loose<00:05:51.410> cannon<00:05:51.770> he<00:05:51.889> just<00:05:52.070> wants
