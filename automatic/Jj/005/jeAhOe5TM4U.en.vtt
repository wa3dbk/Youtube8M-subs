understand<00:00:42.460> how<00:00:42.550> that<00:00:42.700> works

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:43.239 
understand how that works

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:45.330 
understand how that works
so<00:00:43.660> if<00:00:43.780> you<00:00:43.870> look<00:00:44.020> right<00:00:44.050> here<00:00:44.290> from<00:00:45.190> this

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:45.340 
so if you look right here from this

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.900 
so if you look right here from this
point<00:00:45.670> down<00:00:46.140> everything<00:00:47.140> is<00:00:47.350> on<00:00:48.250> the<00:00:48.370> unsprung

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.160 
the suspension move the deck you'll see

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.860 
the suspension move the deck you'll see
will<00:01:00.340> wiggle<00:01:00.640> back<00:01:00.820> and<00:01:00.879> forth<00:01:01.120> but<00:01:01.510> not<00:01:01.690> up

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
will wiggle back and forth but not up

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.869 
will wiggle back and forth but not up
and<00:01:01.989> down<00:01:02.079> proving<00:01:02.890> that<00:01:03.039> it<00:01:03.129> does<00:01:03.280> not<00:01:03.429> scalp

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:03.879 
and down proving that it does not scalp

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:12.890 
and down proving that it does not scalp
but<00:01:04.180> follows<00:01:04.540> the<00:01:04.690> ground<00:01:04.900> contour

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.130 

the<00:01:13.900> is<00:01:14.200> 3,100<00:01:15.040> decks<00:01:15.280> are<00:01:15.550> 61<00:01:16.240> and<00:01:16.510> 72<00:01:16.960> inch

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
the is 3,100 decks are 61 and 72 inch

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.040 
the is 3,100 decks are 61 and 72 inch
and<00:01:17.320> they're<00:01:17.409> both<00:01:17.560> ICD<00:01:18.400> decks<00:01:18.670> and<00:01:18.970> the<00:01:19.479> ICD

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.050 
and they're both ICD decks and the ICD

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:21.840 
and they're both ICD decks and the ICD
what<00:01:20.440> we've<00:01:20.590> done<00:01:20.770> is<00:01:20.979> we<00:01:21.100> put<00:01:21.130> a<00:01:21.310> sloped<00:01:21.610> nose

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
what we've done is we put a sloped nose

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.580 
what we've done is we put a sloped nose
on<00:01:22.090> them<00:01:22.270> change<00:01:22.570> the<00:01:22.750> baffling<00:01:23.170> underneath

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
on them change the baffling underneath

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.680 
on them change the baffling underneath
so<00:01:23.860> you've<00:01:24.010> got<00:01:24.220> better<00:01:24.460> airflow<00:01:24.760> better<00:01:25.420> lift

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
so you've got better airflow better lift

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.380 
so you've got better airflow better lift
and<00:01:25.990> better<00:01:26.260> discharge<00:01:26.830> also<00:01:27.580> with<00:01:27.970> our<00:01:28.000> decks

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
and better discharge also with our decks

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.540 
and better discharge also with our decks
we<00:01:28.630> don't<00:01:28.810> use<00:01:29.050> seven<00:01:29.440> gauge<00:01:29.650> metal<00:01:29.920> the

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
we don't use seven gauge metal the

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.219 
we don't use seven gauge metal the
reason<00:01:30.910> we<00:01:31.000> don't<00:01:31.180> is<00:01:31.450> what<00:01:31.720> seven<00:01:32.050> gauge

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
reason we don't is what seven gauge

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:33.990 
reason we don't is what seven gauge
metal<00:01:32.590> does<00:01:32.770> is<00:01:33.040> it<00:01:33.190> puts<00:01:33.369> thickness<00:01:33.850> and

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
metal does is it puts thickness and

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.940 
metal does is it puts thickness and
weight<00:01:34.150> where<00:01:34.420> you<00:01:34.509> don't<00:01:34.720> need<00:01:34.900> it<00:01:34.960> when<00:01:35.920> you

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
weight where you don't need it when you

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.600 
weight where you don't need it when you
go<00:01:36.220> to<00:01:36.280> the<00:01:36.990> ten<00:01:37.990> gauge<00:01:38.229> that<00:01:38.530> we<00:01:38.710> use<00:01:38.979> and<00:01:39.250> then

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
go to the ten gauge that we use and then

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.880 
go to the ten gauge that we use and then
use<00:01:39.759> double<00:01:40.180> ten<00:01:40.390> gauge<00:01:40.660> in<00:01:40.960> any<00:01:41.440> point<00:01:41.710> that

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
use double ten gauge in any point that

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.219 
use double ten gauge in any point that
needs<00:01:42.100> reinforcing<00:01:42.880> for<00:01:43.539> either<00:01:43.750> thickness

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
needs reinforcing for either thickness

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.529 
needs reinforcing for either thickness
of<00:01:44.410> for<00:01:44.590> abrasion<00:01:45.130> or<00:01:45.250> strength<00:01:45.610> you<00:01:46.119> actually

00:01:46.529 --> 00:01:46.539 
of for abrasion or strength you actually

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:47.880 
of for abrasion or strength you actually
end<00:01:46.690> up<00:01:46.780> with<00:01:46.840> a<00:01:46.990> stronger<00:01:47.440> deck<00:01:47.649> and<00:01:47.830> you

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
end up with a stronger deck and you

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.200 
end up with a stronger deck and you
don't<00:01:48.039> have<00:01:48.130> that<00:01:48.399> extra<00:01:48.640> weight<00:01:48.850> where<00:01:49.119> you

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
don't have that extra weight where you

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.660 
don't have that extra weight where you
don't<00:01:49.420> need<00:01:49.660> it<00:01:49.720> also<00:01:50.680> on<00:01:50.950> our<00:01:50.979> decks<00:01:51.310> we've

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
don't need it also on our decks we've

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.029 
don't need it also on our decks we've
got<00:01:52.000> the<00:01:52.360> Hercules<00:01:52.930> spindles<00:01:53.350> on<00:01:53.470> the<00:01:53.590> 3100

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
the blades underneath the deck and we

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.240 
the blades underneath the deck and we
all<00:02:10.330> know<00:02:10.479> that<00:02:10.660> does<00:02:10.869> happen<00:02:11.140> also<00:02:11.890> on<00:02:12.220> our

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
all know that does happen also on our

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.789 
all know that does happen also on our
decks<00:02:12.610> we've<00:02:12.880> got<00:02:13.150> the<00:02:13.330> larger<00:02:13.750> idler<00:02:14.470> pulleys

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:14.799 
decks we've got the larger idler pulleys

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:16.229 
decks we've got the larger idler pulleys
and<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.100> reason<00:02:15.340> we<00:02:15.430> use<00:02:15.459> larger<00:02:16.000> idler

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
and the reason we use larger idler

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:17.850 
and the reason we use larger idler
pulleys<00:02:16.600> is<00:02:16.780> so<00:02:16.959> that<00:02:17.170> when<00:02:17.320> your<00:02:17.440> belt<00:02:17.650> is

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
pulleys is so that when your belt is

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.890 
pulleys is so that when your belt is
making<00:02:18.220> the<00:02:18.340> bends<00:02:18.730> it's<00:02:19.150> a<00:02:19.299> gentler<00:02:19.690> bend

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
making the bends it's a gentler bend

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.680 
making the bends it's a gentler bend
giving<00:02:20.230> you<00:02:20.320> longer<00:02:20.560> belt<00:02:20.890> light<00:02:21.120> on<00:02:22.120> top<00:02:22.450> of

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
giving you longer belt light on top of

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.570 
giving you longer belt light on top of
those<00:02:22.870> idler<00:02:23.260> pulleys<00:02:23.590> we've<00:02:23.950> got<00:02:24.160> a<00:02:24.190> debris

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
those idler pulleys we've got a debris

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.759 
those idler pulleys we've got a debris
shield<00:02:24.880> that<00:02:25.180> protects<00:02:25.630> the<00:02:25.930> bearing<00:02:26.440> from

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
shield that protects the bearing from

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:29.039 
shield that protects the bearing from
debris<00:02:27.459> dust<00:02:27.910> and<00:02:28.180> more<00:02:28.630> importantly

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.049 
debris dust and more importantly

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:30.870 
debris dust and more importantly
moisture<00:02:29.560> that<00:02:30.130> keeps<00:02:30.370> it<00:02:30.549> out<00:02:30.670> of<00:02:30.790> the

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
moisture that keeps it out of the

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.970 
moisture that keeps it out of the
bearing<00:02:31.180> and<00:02:31.329> also<00:02:31.660> that<00:02:32.320> bearing<00:02:32.739> turns

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
bearing and also that bearing turns

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.310 
bearing and also that bearing turns
slower<00:02:33.340> because<00:02:33.640> it<00:02:34.000> is<00:02:34.150> on<00:02:34.420> a<00:02:34.450> larger<00:02:34.930> idler

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
slower because it is on a larger idler

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.560 
slower because it is on a larger idler

back<00:05:30.070> here<00:05:30.099> you've<00:05:30.520> got<00:05:30.669> your<00:05:30.699> gas<00:05:31.030> cap<00:05:31.090> you

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 
back here you've got your gas cap you

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.080 
back here you've got your gas cap you
can<00:05:32.229> see<00:05:32.349> it's<00:05:32.500> a<00:05:32.560> large<00:05:32.800> gas<00:05:33.070> cap<00:05:33.400> gives<00:05:33.940> you<00:05:34.060> a

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.090 
can see it's a large gas cap gives you a

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:35.730 
can see it's a large gas cap gives you a
large<00:05:34.360> filler<00:05:34.690> neck<00:05:34.930> so<00:05:35.289> that<00:05:35.320> it's<00:05:35.560> much

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:35.740 
large filler neck so that it's much

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.469 
large filler neck so that it's much
easier<00:05:36.099> to<00:05:36.159> fill<00:05:36.400> it<00:05:36.520> without<00:05:36.729> spill

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:37.479 
easier to fill it without spill

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:39.330 
easier to fill it without spill
and<00:05:37.720> also<00:05:37.870> you<00:05:38.080> can<00:05:38.320> see<00:05:38.500> the<00:05:38.620> tether<00:05:38.860> on<00:05:39.130> this

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:39.340

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.300 
use top draw gas tanks this is important

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.090 
use top draw gas tanks this is important
for<00:05:58.389> two<00:05:58.570> reasons<00:05:58.600> first<00:05:59.470> reason<00:05:59.590> is<00:06:00.040> that

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:00.100 
for two reasons first reason is that

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.400 
for two reasons first reason is that
most<00:06:00.729> of<00:06:00.850> the<00:06:00.910> competition<00:06:01.210> uses<00:06:01.900> bottom<00:06:02.229> draw

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:02.410 
most of the competition uses bottom draw

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:04.230 
most of the competition uses bottom draw
tanks<00:06:02.889> and<00:06:03.040> with<00:06:03.130> the<00:06:03.190> bottom<00:06:03.370> draw<00:06:03.669> tank<00:06:04.000> what

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:04.240 
tanks and with the bottom draw tank what

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.000 
tanks and with the bottom draw tank what
happens<00:06:04.660> is<00:06:04.840> almost<00:06:05.199> all<00:06:05.470> of<00:06:05.590> your<00:06:05.710> filling

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:06.010 
happens is almost all of your filling

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:07.830 
happens is almost all of your filling
gets<00:06:06.130> done<00:06:06.400> with<00:06:06.550> gas<00:06:06.760> cans<00:06:07.120> you<00:06:07.449> end<00:06:07.570> up<00:06:07.690> with

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:07.840 
gets done with gas cans you end up with

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.900 
gets done with gas cans you end up with
debris<00:06:08.110> in<00:06:08.320> the<00:06:08.440> tanks<00:06:08.830> it<00:06:09.250> has<00:06:09.460> a<00:06:09.490> central

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:09.910 
debris in the tanks it has a central

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:12.750 
debris in the tanks it has a central
site<00:06:10.210> to<00:06:10.389> go<00:06:10.570> to<00:06:10.600> so<00:06:11.500> it<00:06:11.919> ends<00:06:12.280> up<00:06:12.370> getting<00:06:12.550> to

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:12.760 
site to go to so it ends up getting to

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.070 
site to go to so it ends up getting to
your<00:06:12.850> filter<00:06:13.150> then<00:06:13.600> on<00:06:13.810> into<00:06:14.050> your

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080 
your filter then on into your

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.260 
your filter then on into your
carburation<00:06:14.590> system<00:06:15.190> and<00:06:15.340> that<00:06:15.940> gives<00:06:16.180> you

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:16.270 
carburation system and that gives you

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:18.240 
carburation system and that gives you

00:06:24.779 --> 00:06:24.789 
keeps moving back and forth and that

00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:26.340 
keeps moving back and forth and that
helps<00:06:25.120> so<00:06:25.270> that<00:06:25.300> the<00:06:25.570> debris<00:06:25.810> doesn't<00:06:26.139> get

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:26.350 
helps so that the debris doesn't get

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:28.590 
helps so that the debris doesn't get
into<00:06:26.560> the<00:06:26.680> system<00:06:26.889> and<00:06:27.220> it<00:06:27.760> cost<00:06:28.210> you<00:06:28.389> less<00:06:28.539> of

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:28.600 
into the system and it cost you less of

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.300 
into the system and it cost you less of
maintenance<00:06:29.080> down<00:06:29.260> the<00:06:29.410> road<00:06:29.590> probably<00:06:30.130> the

00:06:32.189 --> 00:06:32.199 
most important factor is with a top draw

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:34.290 
most important factor is with a top draw
