00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.649
 the first generation of legs in syria was unquestionably large 

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:04.440
 good luck 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.960
 but it criticized the car a lot 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.840
 there came the criticism of 5 or people who cannot inspire it but pay attention 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.249
 the kiwi class was just about to come 

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:17.409
 Wessels couldn't make that but complaints were certain 

00:00:17.409 --> 00:00:19.409
 ap tripoli 

00:00:19.409 --> 00:00:21.769
 he was way too expensive 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:24.599
 and very good but very uncomfortable 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:27.900
 talking about second generation dementia today we can look beautiful 

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:29.039
 what is resolved 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.960
 4 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.930
 washing man 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.530
 8 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.450
 year 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.470
 we are going to start with the money 18 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.890
 cindy behind himself 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.400
 being at the forefront of life it's about the idea 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.550
 it doesn't matter much but the space has also increased 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.980
 happily surprised for a series also says something about going for it 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.450
 also were just really good 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.580
 I am in the further follow but that gives an 83 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.580
 that is something different than in generation 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.010
 than the hour is the new edition it is certainly not in Amsterdam for appropriate 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:08.740
 look wise 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.190
 there is also criticism 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.850
 so that he really impressed the silent photos but the back 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.110
 volkswagen polo 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.550
 that material used it was also complained about before and wrongly 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.860
 if I cover the roof is rock hard plastic it is now even more pronounced 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.190
 about a solution 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.870
 the elephant 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.810
 because used years seems like work 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.979
 the north sea is very special but for the finish that i am not very good 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.210
 there experience you just notice that there is not much bigger here than the previous week 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.270
 because that space in the back seat of course ball behind the wheel you see 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.680
 those with many cases the operation went well lots of room in the 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:48.720
 cockpit 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.030
 that has just become a lot more mature with the experience actually in the 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.030
 space that playground definitely plays a role in 

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:13.449
 the 

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:17.519
 both engines will submit a complaint in the course of the weekend and win 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:21.229
 the sixth round of 70 years and this does not include gas 

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:25.999
 breda 6 0 o jan everyone thinks they are running don't think the edese is dnb 

00:02:25.999 --> 00:02:27.159
 wants to acknowledge 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:30.579
 it is a mug all by itself, but it is further developed by bbl 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:33.419
 insisted modified turbos changed of course had to in addition 

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:34.889
 be placed longitudinally 

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:37.579
 And that says there are adjustments 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:38.899
 but nonetheless 

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:43.169
 very good draw is a bit the the foreigners is also very broad 

00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:44.579
 accelerator pedal response 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:48.169
 it is not a real sports car, it is not a concern and more important is that we 

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:51.729
 fifteen hundred then was a maximum couple counting fifteen to play there 

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:55.119
 then you sit lower just says 

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:59.829
 60 61 proposition and then twelve hundred illegal distilleries public 160 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:02.829
 50,000 touring gives wax 

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:06.869
 effects of road boxtel 15 6 

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:09.869
 there are so many left 

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:14.849
 Yes 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:19.169
 and if you want to read and drive board follow the news about it 

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:21.799
 natural bmw further strengthened during the winter break 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:24.049
 why is it interesting? 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:27.269
 This one day and unions stated that it was not fair that there was a miracle 

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:29.839
 and loosely runs very well 

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:33.069
 but what falls is that very comfortable is actually and everyone equally clear 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:35.139
 for the one series 

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:36.809
 same line 

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:40.629
 the victory 15, which is also a predecessor for translators, but certainly not 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:43.739
 minister who enjoys more dynamic absolutely not and that also applies to one 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.049
 series it is the balance in the car that is very good the focus is perhaps 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:49.209
 to sharpen again 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:51.359
 but that promise this car 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:55.150
 very beautiful very stable is sdu mussel field kilometers per hour he scores 

00:03:55.149 --> 00:03:55.789
 good 

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:58.789
 it reminds a bit of the 3 series that you have to think about and who doesn't 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:09.209
 unfortunately money passed away the woman was for the whole car as such a lot 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.279
 become more mature and play along and win the 3 series crawled 

00:04:12.279 --> 00:04:14.809
 I think have fun during it 

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:17.840
 these insights consider even more than in the previous version 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.879
 it is that space within the balance of the chassis 

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:25.340
 the size of the car I was robbed once what pushed it up 

00:04:25.339 --> 00:04:28.339
 there is also room for the future to keep up with the others in syria 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.300
 to 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:43.650
 to go
