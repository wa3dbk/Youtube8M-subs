Alabama<00:02:24.140> we<00:02:24.680> have<00:02:24.709> sauger<00:02:25.100> in<00:02:25.400> canada<00:02:25.880> swell

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
Alabama we have sauger in canada swell

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.630 
Alabama we have sauger in canada swell
clay<00:02:26.390> especially<00:02:26.930> in<00:02:27.019> Ontario<00:02:27.470> Quebec<00:02:27.640> but

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
clay especially in Ontario Quebec but

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.670 
clay especially in Ontario Quebec but
this<00:02:29.329> would<00:02:29.510> be<00:02:29.660> considered<00:02:30.109> a<00:02:30.200> big<00:02:30.380> sagar

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
this would be considered a big sagar

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.979 
this would be considered a big sagar
okay<00:02:31.160> so<00:02:31.400> I<00:02:31.670> think<00:02:31.940> our<00:02:32.299> Canadian<00:02:32.690> record

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
okay so I think our Canadian record

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:34.569 
okay so I think our Canadian record
sagres<00:02:33.380> around<00:02:33.650> seven<00:02:34.010> pounds

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:34.579 
sagres around seven pounds

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:37.930 
sagres around seven pounds
go<00:02:34.820> where<00:02:35.359> walleye<00:02:35.900> is<00:02:36.470> 22<00:02:37.040> pounds<00:02:37.459> so<00:02:37.790> they

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
go where walleye is 22 pounds so they

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:38.970 
go where walleye is 22 pounds so they
get<00:02:38.180> really<00:02:38.480> big

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
get really big

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.550 
get really big
that<00:02:39.980> fish<00:02:40.310> I'm<00:02:40.609> guessing<00:02:41.180> is<00:02:41.269> about<00:02:41.600> 14<00:02:42.109> 15

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
that fish I'm guessing is about 14 15

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.740 
that fish I'm guessing is about 14 15
inches<00:02:42.650> mm-hmm<00:02:43.340> and<00:02:43.579> what<00:02:43.880> I'm<00:02:43.970> gonna<00:02:44.090> do<00:02:44.329> the

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
inches mm-hmm and what I'm gonna do the

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.630 
inches mm-hmm and what I'm gonna do the
tape<00:02:44.959> measures<00:02:45.320> right<00:02:45.500> beside<00:02:45.829> you<00:02:46.040> take<00:02:46.549> a

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
tape measures right beside you take a

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.729 
tape measures right beside you take a
measurement<00:02:46.940> because<00:02:47.540> the<00:02:47.690> first<00:02:48.380> fish<00:02:48.590> is

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
measurement because the first fish is

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.560 
measurement because the first fish is
always<00:02:48.920> a<00:02:49.040> little<00:02:49.310> bit<00:02:49.459> hard<00:02:49.730> until<00:02:50.239> you<00:02:50.450> get

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
always a little bit hard until you get

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.180 
always a little bit hard until you get
used<00:02:50.750> to<00:02:50.930> seeing<00:02:51.140> fish<00:02:51.440> of<00:02:51.590> the<00:02:51.680> same<00:02:51.890> size

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
used to seeing fish of the same size

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.280 
used to seeing fish of the same size
right<00:02:52.519> because<00:02:53.299> we<00:02:53.420> don't<00:02:53.450> want<00:02:53.690> to<00:02:53.780> keep<00:02:53.930> a

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
right because we don't want to keep a

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.770 
right because we don't want to keep a
lot<00:02:55.160> of<00:02:55.310> you<00:02:55.880> know<00:02:55.970> bigger<00:02:56.180> fish<00:02:56.450> because<00:02:56.660> we

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
lot of you know bigger fish because we

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:57.970 
lot of you know bigger fish because we
don't<00:02:57.019> have<00:02:57.049> a<00:02:57.170> shore<00:02:57.350> lunch<00:02:57.470> tonight<00:02:57.829> with

yesterday<00:03:04.100> we<00:03:04.190> were<00:03:04.310> pre<00:03:04.519> fishing<00:03:04.910> right<00:03:05.120> and

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
yesterday we were pre fishing right and

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.360 
yesterday we were pre fishing right and
we<00:03:05.720> got<00:03:05.870> a<00:03:05.900> couple<00:03:06.140> to<00:03:06.350> around<00:03:06.620> five<00:03:06.859> pounds

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
we got a couple to around five pounds

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.539 
we got a couple to around five pounds
well<00:03:07.940> so<00:03:08.120> they<00:03:08.239> would<00:03:08.390> have<00:03:08.510> been<00:03:08.630> up<00:03:08.780> in<00:03:08.959> 20<00:03:09.890> 23

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549 
well so they would have been up in 20 23

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:13.449 
well so they would have been up in 20 23
24<00:03:11.090> inch<00:03:11.269> range<00:03:11.540> right<00:03:11.870> but<00:03:12.650> I<00:03:12.950> think<00:03:13.160> they're

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
24 inch range right but I think they're

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.460 
24 inch range right but I think they're
so<00:03:13.640> like<00:03:13.940> colored<00:03:14.299> like<00:03:14.480> this<00:03:14.720> because<00:03:15.260> of<00:03:15.290> the

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
so like colored like this because of the

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.890 
so like colored like this because of the
color<00:03:15.680> the<00:03:15.769> Detroit<00:03:16.250> River<00:03:16.660> so<00:03:17.660> a<00:03:17.690> lot<00:03:17.870> of

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
times you get them near weeds and a

time of the year the walleye tend to

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:54.690 
time of the year the walleye tend to
move<00:03:53.200> around<00:03:53.320> a<00:03:53.620> lot<00:03:53.770> more<00:03:54.010> because<00:03:54.310> it<00:03:54.550> is

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
move around a lot more because it is

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.670 
move around a lot more because it is
June<00:03:55.030> and<00:03:55.180> this<00:03:55.390> year<00:03:55.690> things<00:03:56.350> were<00:03:56.620> very

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
June and this year things were very

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.010 
June and this year things were very
early<00:03:57.190> so<00:03:57.970> the<00:03:58.090> fish<00:03:58.240> came<00:03:58.480> in<00:03:58.600> and<00:03:58.750> spawning

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.020 
early so the fish came in and spawning

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:00.360 
early so the fish came in and spawning
there<00:03:59.260> pretty<00:03:59.410> well<00:03:59.530> in<00:03:59.770> the<00:03:59.860> summer<00:04:00.070> pattern

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
there pretty well in the summer pattern

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.730 
there pretty well in the summer pattern
even<00:04:00.820> though<00:04:00.910> we're<00:04:01.060> not<00:04:01.090> June<00:04:01.420> 21st<00:04:01.990> yet<00:04:02.230> so

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:02.740 
even though we're not June 21st yet so

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.620 
even though we're not June 21st yet so
the<00:04:02.890> fish<00:04:03.070> are<00:04:03.280> suspended<00:04:04.030> off<00:04:04.150> the<00:04:04.180> bottom

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
the fish are suspended off the bottom

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.000 
the fish are suspended off the bottom
and<00:04:04.720> moving<00:04:05.020> around<00:04:05.170> a<00:04:05.290> lot<00:04:05.410> one<00:04:05.650> of<00:04:05.680> the<00:04:05.800> best

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
and moving around a lot one of the best

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.800 
and moving around a lot one of the best
ways<00:04:06.220> to<00:04:06.250> get<00:04:06.550> them<00:04:06.730> instead<00:04:07.030> of<00:04:07.090> just<00:04:07.210> jigging

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
ways to get them instead of just jigging

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.510 
ways to get them instead of just jigging
when<00:04:08.050> you're<00:04:08.200> fishing<00:04:08.380> slow<00:04:08.770> and<00:04:08.950> covering<00:04:09.460> a

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
very small area is to actually troll

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.230 
very small area is to actually troll
with<00:04:11.980> the<00:04:12.160> electric<00:04:12.580> and<00:04:12.730> with<00:04:12.820> the<00:04:12.940> current

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:13.240 
with the electric and with the current

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.310 
with the electric and with the current
that's<00:04:13.330> what<00:04:13.480> we<00:04:13.540> were<00:04:13.630> doing<00:04:13.660> today<00:04:13.930> and

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320 
that's what we were doing today and

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.979 
that's what we were doing today and
using<00:04:15.130> harnesses<00:04:15.820> to<00:04:15.850> track<00:04:16.270> the<00:04:16.480> fish<00:04:16.690> to

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
using harnesses to track the fish to

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:18.930 
using harnesses to track the fish to
come<00:04:17.140> in<00:04:17.320> too<00:04:17.470> close<00:04:17.650> and<00:04:18.040> then<00:04:18.430> to<00:04:18.580> take<00:04:18.730> what

here<00:04:20.830> the<00:04:21.280> ones<00:04:21.430> all<00:04:21.760> of<00:04:21.910> these<00:04:22.030> actually<00:04:22.450> are

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
here the ones all of these actually are

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:23.280 
here the ones all of these actually are
Lucky<00:04:22.780> Strike

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.290 
Lucky Strike

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:25.590 
Lucky Strike
worm<00:04:23.500> harnesses<00:04:24.040> the<00:04:24.520> ones<00:04:24.730> on<00:04:24.910> my<00:04:25.060> left<00:04:25.360> are

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
worm harnesses the ones on my left are

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.750 
worm harnesses the ones on my left are
on<00:04:25.660> a<00:04:25.720> fluorocarbon<00:04:26.440> leader<00:04:26.590> and<00:04:26.950> these<00:04:27.580> are

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
on a fluorocarbon leader and these are

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.130 
on a fluorocarbon leader and these are
some<00:04:27.910> of<00:04:27.940> the<00:04:28.030> larger<00:04:28.450> blades<00:04:28.690> that<00:04:28.900> we<00:04:29.020> were

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140 
some of the larger blades that we were

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.110 
some of the larger blades that we were
using<00:04:29.500> today<00:04:29.650> with<00:04:30.280> different<00:04:30.610> colored<00:04:30.910> beads

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
using today with different colored beads

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.600 
using today with different colored beads
the<00:04:31.600> ones<00:04:31.840> on<00:04:32.050> my<00:04:32.200> right<00:04:32.500> are<00:04:32.920> actually<00:04:33.160> on<00:04:33.580> a

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
the ones on my right are actually on a

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.460 
the ones on my right are actually on a
stranded<00:04:34.390> wire<00:04:34.660> leader<00:04:35.020> I<00:04:35.140> don't<00:04:35.290> know<00:04:35.350> if<00:04:35.410> you

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
stranded wire leader I don't know if you

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:36.870 
stranded wire leader I don't know if you
can<00:04:35.560> see<00:04:35.740> the<00:04:35.830> reflection<00:04:36.310> from<00:04:36.340> the<00:04:36.610> Sun

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
can see the reflection from the Sun

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.030 
can see the reflection from the Sun
there<00:04:37.120> these<00:04:37.780> have<00:04:38.020> three<00:04:38.200> hooks<00:04:38.530> and<00:04:38.860> they've

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040 
there these have three hooks and they've

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.010 
there these have three hooks and they've
been<00:04:39.190> crimped<00:04:39.550> on<00:04:39.670> these<00:04:40.210> have<00:04:40.420> single<00:04:40.840> hooks

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
been crimped on these have single hooks

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.930 
been crimped on these have single hooks
so<00:04:41.590> there's<00:04:41.770> all<00:04:41.890> kinds<00:04:42.190> of<00:04:42.250> worm<00:04:42.400> harnesses

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
so there's all kinds of worm harnesses

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.910 
so there's all kinds of worm harnesses
what<00:04:43.420> seems<00:04:43.690> to<00:04:43.780> be<00:04:43.870> really<00:04:44.230> important<00:04:44.680> is<00:04:44.800> the

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:44.920 
what seems to be really important is the

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.460 
what seems to be really important is the
size<00:04:45.190> of<00:04:45.400> the<00:04:45.490> blade<00:04:45.700> and<00:04:45.970> the<00:04:46.300> color<00:04:46.540> so<00:04:47.200> these

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
size of the blade and the color so these

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.650 
size of the blade and the color so these
that<00:04:47.710> are<00:04:48.070> metal<00:04:48.340> strand<00:04:48.700> are<00:04:48.910> good<00:04:49.150> to<00:04:49.300> use<00:04:49.480> if

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
that are metal strand are good to use if

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.240 
that are metal strand are good to use if
you're<00:04:49.780> fishing<00:04:50.140> in<00:04:50.260> an<00:04:50.380> area<00:04:50.740> we've<00:04:50.980> got<00:04:51.100> a

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
you're fishing in an area we've got a

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.280 
you're fishing in an area we've got a
good<00:04:51.460> chance<00:04:51.670> of<00:04:51.880> hooking<00:04:52.000> up<00:04:52.270> Pike<00:04:52.540> or<00:04:52.780> maybe

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.290 
good chance of hooking up Pike or maybe

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.860 
good chance of hooking up Pike or maybe
even<00:04:53.380> muskie<00:04:54.010> in<00:04:54.100> some<00:04:54.310> of<00:04:54.430> our<00:04:54.550> lakes<00:04:54.820> so<00:04:55.570> the

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
even muskie in some of our lakes so the

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.680 
even muskie in some of our lakes so the
other<00:04:56.430> blades<00:04:57.430> that<00:04:57.580> were<00:04:57.700> working<00:04:57.880> well<00:04:58.210> this

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:58.690 
other blades that were working well this

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.090 
other blades that were working well this
is<00:04:58.870> almost<00:04:59.080> a<00:04:59.200> number<00:04:59.440> four<00:04:59.710> blade<00:04:59.920> it's<00:05:00.040> a

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100 
is almost a number four blade it's a

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.710 
is almost a number four blade it's a
pretty<00:05:00.280> large<00:05:00.460> blade<00:05:00.850> so<00:05:01.390> this<00:05:01.540> particular

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
pretty large blade so this particular

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.200 
pretty large blade so this particular
one<00:05:02.050> is<00:05:02.410> by<00:05:02.620> newer<00:05:03.220> Jensen<00:05:03.730> and<00:05:03.910> they<00:05:04.060> also

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.210 
one is by newer Jensen and they also

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:06.180 
one is by newer Jensen and they also
work<00:05:04.510> very<00:05:04.540> well<00:05:04.990> so<00:05:05.440> if<00:05:05.500> you<00:05:05.620> match<00:05:05.800> the<00:05:06.040> right

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
work very well so if you match the right

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.880 
work very well so if you match the right
blades<00:05:06.490> and<00:05:06.790> just<00:05:07.150> use<00:05:07.420> worms<00:05:07.930> worms<00:05:08.590> in<00:05:08.830> the

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:08.890 
blades and just use worms worms in the

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:10.500 
blades and just use worms worms in the
summer<00:05:09.100> time<00:05:09.340> work<00:05:09.550> especially<00:05:09.790> well<00:05:10.300> for

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 
summer time work especially well for

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.690 
summer time work especially well for
walleye<00:05:10.870> even<00:05:11.620> though<00:05:11.740> they're<00:05:11.890> feeding<00:05:12.130> on<00:05:12.400> a

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:12.700 
walleye even though they're feeding on a

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.760 
walleye even though they're feeding on a
variety<00:05:12.910> of<00:05:13.210> gobies<00:05:14.080> and<00:05:14.110> I'm<00:05:14.380> sure<00:05:14.530> they're

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
variety of gobies and I'm sure they're

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.770 
variety of gobies and I'm sure they're
bait<00:05:14.920> fish<00:05:15.190> and<00:05:15.430> even<00:05:15.580> lamprey<00:05:16.150> and<00:05:16.390> you'll

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.780 
bait fish and even lamprey and you'll

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:29.559 
bait fish and even lamprey and you'll
probably<00:05:16.870> find<00:05:17.200> those<00:05:17.410> fish<00:05:17.560> and<00:05:17.770> ketchup

00:05:29.559 --> 00:05:29.569 

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:35.839 

all<00:05:30.569> right<00:05:30.960> clay<00:05:32.840> yeah<00:05:33.840> let's<00:05:34.020> go<00:05:34.199> boarded<00:05:34.849> now

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:35.849 
all right clay yeah let's go boarded now

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:37.879 
all right clay yeah let's go boarded now
I<00:05:35.879> think<00:05:36.300> it's<00:05:36.419> gonna<00:05:36.539> be<00:05:36.719> a<00:05:36.749> walleye

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:37.889 
I think it's gonna be a walleye

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:39.969 
I think it's gonna be a walleye
Pat<00:05:38.430> or<00:05:38.699> barb<00:05:38.909> can<00:05:39.060> I<00:05:39.120> just<00:05:39.300> have<00:05:39.419> the<00:05:39.449> net

be assured inner fish we got this little

00:05:47.819 --> 00:05:49.909 
be assured inner fish we got this little
bull<00:05:48.090> in<00:05:48.180> the<00:05:48.270> background<00:05:48.719> this<00:05:48.840> one<00:05:49.020> fishing

00:05:59.059 --> 00:05:59.069 
you got to watch those boats yesterday

00:05:59.069 --> 00:06:01.610 
you got to watch those boats yesterday
when<00:05:59.219> we<00:05:59.310> were<00:05:59.400> up<00:05:59.520> here<00:05:59.699> pre-fishing<00:06:00.620> they

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:01.620 
when we were up here pre-fishing they

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:07.700 
when we were up here pre-fishing they
weren't<00:06:01.889> moving<00:06:03.499> this<00:06:04.499> is<00:06:04.650> a<00:06:04.680> wall<00:06:04.919> I<00:06:06.710> guess

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:07.710 
weren't moving this is a wall I guess

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:11.200 
weren't moving this is a wall I guess
what<00:06:07.949> clay<00:06:08.219> it's<00:06:09.089> a<00:06:09.180> good<00:06:09.360> eater<00:06:09.539> a<00:06:10.069> Farfalla

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:11.210 
what clay it's a good eater a Farfalla

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.309 
what clay it's a good eater a Farfalla
he's<00:06:12.210> probably<00:06:12.360> the<00:06:12.539> size<00:06:12.779> of<00:06:12.960> some<00:06:13.110> of<00:06:13.229> those

00:06:13.309 --> 00:06:13.319 
he's probably the size of some of those

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:15.499 
he's probably the size of some of those
sagres<00:06:13.770> that<00:06:13.979> you<00:06:14.069> get<00:06:14.249> back<00:06:14.460> home<00:06:14.729> if<00:06:15.300> there
