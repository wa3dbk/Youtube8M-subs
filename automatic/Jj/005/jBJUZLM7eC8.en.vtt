00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:05.790
 good kids very good everyone here 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.590
 we are a new video you are going to see the 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.830
 starting probably the fastest that 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:12.690
 I've never been blank 2 since I 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.640
 is to start and start killing already as 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.990
 You have been starting the game for 

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.699
 start the lost game is started 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.669
 but it's going into the game and start 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.589
 to kill we are losing 15 points 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:24.269
 kill already once killed 2 

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:25.919
 she does not die more times you are going to see that 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.470
 the game is not the video is very short 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:30.899
 and in less than two and a half minutes I 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.070
 I make a 38 euros now it is a non stop 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:34.469
 kill and as you see is using the 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.800
 car that is trying to get me out 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.820
 the heads and I just swelled the 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.640
 I really did not expect anything at all 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.829
 to be able to get this out in such a short time and 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.809
 good above all you have to have in 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.699
 account once you enter clubs although 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.379
 the car is where I am right now 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:51.510
 the pairs behind this car you have 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.649
 controlled practically almost all the 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.660
 map obviously beware of 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.129
 explosions with the people above and if 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.030
 you have more or less controlled all of that 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.010
 well 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.410
 you have to throw the game you have the 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.330
 gusts and you have everything so I wanted 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.430
 bring this game that is so super 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.590
 quick I loved the truth is that I 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.509
 really liked it because I got here in 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.460
 the car a moment for now then already 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:14.229
 I get in your answer in the house is that 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.320
 they kept coming they kept coming 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:18.610
 and the truth is that I took the helicopter 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.710
 there as you see and clouds to day of 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.550
 burgers there will be a line simply 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.590
 more than a few more I took out the dogs 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.530
 I understand nathan for the rock as 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.540
 this was no longer winning and it was over 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.890
 right away so nothing kids 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.770
 faces I take them simply with the 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.770
 fast charger because I carry the weapons 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:51.090
 fast at most of the point 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.750
 red nothing this afternoon I do the same 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.170
 little of 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:02:00.170
 in the evening and if you do not have another 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.670
 video as always nothing will be nothing 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.759
 different to our days trying 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.960
 yesterday to make a stream but as you know xbox 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:10.119
 he fell he was not going 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.590
 No one was going so I just 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.060
 I hope that next time I can 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.530
 streaming is not improved by that 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.450
 I only had six and yesterday a video that 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.020
 I had not prepared the second I wanted 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.580
 I'm waiting for streaming the two 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.709
 months that we were there an hour and a half 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.959
 just trying to do this same 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:28.870
 there was no way so nothing kids 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:30.160
 this is what the game has been and you see 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.459
 there the last two that in some double 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.810
 and a 38 one to finish in less than 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.950
 two and a half minutes they follow kids or 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.110
 I hope you liked it is me 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.970
 like favorites and see you next 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.560
 video by the way I love that they have 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.200
 since split tables as I said 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.400
 since it can take you games like 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.720
 extraction to what many formats said 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.720
 new 37 goodbye
