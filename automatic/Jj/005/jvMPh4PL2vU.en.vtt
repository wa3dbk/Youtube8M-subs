00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
the nose on this whole much shorter so

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.830 
the nose on this whole much shorter so

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
there's your breath as its circulating

there's your breath as its circulating

in the in the helmet if you don't have

the buyers rope and I think warms your

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.290 
the buyers rope and I think warms your
warms<00:02:18.530> the<00:02:18.710> inner<00:02:18.830> compartment<00:02:19.550> a<00:02:19.760> lot

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
warms the inner compartment a lot

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.680 
warms the inner compartment a lot
quicker<00:02:21.310> some<00:02:23.170> things<00:02:24.170> to<00:02:24.410> point<00:02:24.770> out<00:02:24.980> this

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
quicker some things to point out this

quicker some things to point out this
release<00:02:26.690> levers<00:02:27.140> is<00:02:27.320> sort<00:02:27.560> of<00:02:27.650> a<00:02:27.770> single<00:02:28.220> it

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
release levers is sort of a single it

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.680 
release levers is sort of a single it
comes<00:02:28.610> up<00:02:28.790> really<00:02:29.060> easy<00:02:29.390> that<00:02:30.140> the<00:02:31.690> connectors

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
comes up really easy that the connectors

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:38.850 
comes up really easy that the connectors
here<00:02:32.870> are<00:02:33.050> all<00:02:33.230> metal<00:02:33.800> and<00:02:34.720> I<00:02:36.460> when<00:02:37.460> I<00:02:37.490> took<00:02:37.610> a

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
here are all metal and I when I took a

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.050 
here are all metal and I when I took a
motorcycle<00:02:39.860> training<00:02:40.040> class<00:02:40.340> they<00:02:40.610> really

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
motorcycle training class they really

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.540 
motorcycle training class they really
could<00:02:41.870> not<00:02:41.900> the<00:02:42.500> instructor<00:02:42.950> could<00:02:43.130> not<00:02:43.280> stand

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
could not the instructor could not stand

could not the instructor could not stand
modular<00:02:44.150> helmets<00:02:44.720> and<00:02:44.900> I<00:02:44.990> don't<00:02:45.650> know<00:02:45.860> why<00:02:46.700> and

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
modular helmets and I don't know why and

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.830 
modular helmets and I don't know why and
he<00:02:47.860> really<00:02:48.860> spent<00:02:49.250> some<00:02:49.430> time<00:02:49.840> railing

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
he really spent some time railing

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.540 
he really spent some time railing
against<00:02:51.260> him<00:02:51.380> so<00:02:51.560> I<00:02:51.590> don't<00:02:51.860> know<00:02:51.980> if<00:02:52.160> he<00:02:52.370> had

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
against him so I don't know if he had

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.850 
against him so I don't know if he had
somebody<00:02:53.270> close<00:02:53.810> to<00:02:53.840> him<00:02:54.080> that<00:02:54.290> had<00:02:54.680> been

somebody close to him that had been

somebody close to him that had been
injured<00:02:55.190> or<00:02:55.490> what<00:02:56.390> but<00:02:56.810> seems<00:02:57.470> to<00:02:57.590> be<00:02:57.709> a

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.740 
injured or what but seems to be a

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.930 
injured or what but seems to be a
paranoia<00:02:58.900> with<00:02:59.900> them<00:03:00.140> and<00:03:00.380> I'm<00:03:01.010> in<00:03:01.400> papers

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
paranoia with them and I'm in papers

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.000 
paranoia with them and I'm in papers
I've<00:03:02.150> never<00:03:02.630> read<00:03:02.870> of<00:03:02.989> an<00:03:03.080> accident<00:03:03.500> were<00:03:03.709> a

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
I've never read of an accident were a

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.840 
I've never read of an accident were a
modular<00:03:04.940> helmet<00:03:05.150> contributed<00:03:06.140> to<00:03:06.380> to<00:03:07.370> the

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
modular helmet contributed to to the

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.910 
modular helmet contributed to to the
injury<00:03:08.180> so<00:03:08.510> I<00:03:08.540> I<00:03:08.750> don't<00:03:09.140> know<00:03:09.230> but<00:03:09.470> it<00:03:09.590> was<00:03:09.709> this

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
injury so I I don't know but it was this

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.340 
injury so I I don't know but it was this
one<00:03:10.070> is<00:03:10.250> a<00:03:10.280> simple<00:03:10.700> release<00:03:11.480> now<00:03:11.720> the<00:03:11.780> Nolan

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
one is a simple release now the Nolan

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:17.080 
one is a simple release now the Nolan
it's<00:03:13.040> not<00:03:13.310> it's<00:03:13.640> you<00:03:14.000> have<00:03:14.239> to<00:03:14.420> take<00:03:15.340> this<00:03:16.340> pull

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
it's not it's you have to take this pull

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.110 
it's not it's you have to take this pull
it<00:03:17.239> so<00:03:18.110> there's<00:03:18.410> more<00:03:18.650> of<00:03:18.769> a<00:03:18.860> process<00:03:19.250> to

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
it so there's more of a process to

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.670 
it so there's more of a process to
getting<00:03:20.360> it<00:03:20.570> open<00:03:20.720> so<00:03:20.989> this<00:03:21.920> if<00:03:22.250> you<00:03:22.850> impact

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
getting it open so this if you impact

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.720 
getting it open so this if you impact
hopefully<00:03:24.680> you<00:03:24.799> never<00:03:24.920> have<00:03:25.220> to<00:03:25.370> test<00:03:25.610> that

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
hopefully you never have to test that

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.420 
hopefully you never have to test that
but<00:03:26.090> if<00:03:26.180> you<00:03:26.299> do<00:03:26.480> this<00:03:27.320> is<00:03:27.620> this<00:03:27.920> is<00:03:28.130> much<00:03:28.400> more

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
but if you do this is this is much more

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.449 
but if you do this is this is much more
you<00:03:28.880> can<00:03:29.120> even<00:03:29.239> hear<00:03:29.510> when<00:03:29.810> it<00:03:30.100> when<00:03:31.100> it<00:03:31.130> locks

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
you can even hear when it when it locks

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.570 
you can even hear when it when it locks
where<00:03:31.940> this<00:03:32.060> is<00:03:32.299> just<00:03:32.510> a<00:03:32.690> this<00:03:33.370> is<00:03:34.370> much<00:03:34.549> more

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
where this is just a this is much more

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.020 
where this is just a this is much more
simple<00:03:35.239> mechanism<00:03:35.900> so<00:03:36.200> but<00:03:36.920> I'm<00:03:37.100> feeling<00:03:37.549> okay

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
simple mechanism so but I'm feeling okay

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.560 
simple mechanism so but I'm feeling okay
with<00:03:38.239> this<00:03:39.190> the<00:03:40.190> shield<00:03:40.489> I<00:03:40.730> don't<00:03:41.390> know<00:03:41.510> you

with this the shield I don't know you

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.690 
with this the shield I don't know you
can<00:03:41.930> see<00:03:42.290> it<00:03:42.470> if<00:03:42.620> it's<00:03:42.769> dark<00:03:43.040> enough<00:03:43.190> but<00:03:43.519> this

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
can see it if it's dark enough but this

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.610 
can see it if it's dark enough but this
comes<00:03:43.940> down<00:03:44.150> with<00:03:44.209> just<00:03:44.630> the<00:03:44.780> press<00:03:45.290> of<00:03:45.440> this
