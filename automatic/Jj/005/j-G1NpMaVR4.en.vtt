00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:19.770
 friends have recently downloaded anywhere 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.350
 did not go new magazines did not buy that 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.920
 do of course play call of 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.490
 duty 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.109
 and here some already complain all the same 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.019
 tracking where is cold 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.930
 here she is funny how fast I am 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.809
 tired of all the guns in GOST 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:41.340
 any kind of spineless will 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:44.430
 dude and I decided to go through the regime and me 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.079
 eyes immediately caught the Ganges, I remembered 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.420
 I loved the regime did not like me 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:52.079
 how to play after black ops and I 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:56.370
 special and did not play hi dude then another 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:59.910
 one well see the world for already 4 fluff 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:03.420
 open and so I decided that my first 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:07.890
 the game in the ganges before that year is clearly not 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.510
 Only defmatch was played in it, and 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.400
 actually did not try everything anymore 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:15.450
 no regime at least some new 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:18.450
 there is and no I went to try new 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:22.830
 Sechin Destry where you can raise 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:27.390
 togaf raise their teammates so still 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:32.100
 one I have seen the race dropped out and fell 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:35.310
 that this card is in my opinion one of the most 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:38.540
 terrible in a game so completely 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:42.799
 senseless rift two houses while 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:46.229
 remember again in the fourth part was 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:49.680
 it looks like a map somewhere in Ukraine there with 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:52.530
 Lenin is also two buildings opposite each other 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:56.460
 friend there is a transition which 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.350
 go where he should not have gone to where where 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.530
 who am I unfortunately can not here 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.710
 watch him repeat from his face 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.509
 how I lost but you saw me 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.479
 lost it and it was certainly 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.080
 fun enough so around here 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.420
 dude we're on radar but 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:17.170
 day and very clearly did not find the euro 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:19.240
 Yen already ran away in general so the card was 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:23.440
 somehow funny and loved her many not 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:25.440
 loved so much on promotion because there 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:30.360
 you just had to run in a circle or 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:34.570
 become a sniper back and be regarded 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.670
 stood from house to house well i'm running 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:40.210
 circle came to this sniper 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:47.200
 behind the back and cut I liked it 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:49.420
 The map is somewhat similar, but we have no 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:55.030
 for some reason does not bring pleasure 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:59.500
 right because ooh ooh and for fluff I 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:02.560
 with her even climbed on the upper terrace so 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:06.100
 these are big houses there they have lots of floors 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:09.400
 it all somehow turns out great 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:12.270
 and but again my one of the main 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:15.300
 Claims guest completely unreasonable 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:17.530
 huge card so we need some 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:21.040
 easy frag because of this gun 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:24.040
 penalty he doesnâ€™t have much distance 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.050
 cut about what to me from very far out 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:29.400
 any other gun with a short range 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:33.850
 they'll kill us and some lucky 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:37.180
 such a but this torment is necessary well 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:42.390
 get into what is desirable in the emphasis just 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:46.269
 kill so lucky lucky 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.050
 already sniper we do not know how some 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:50.670
 on account 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:55.180
 you play once fell 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:58.390
 someone should be here now where you ran 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.640
 empty material itself but nonetheless 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:03.100
 where did he not go too somehow 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.110
 arrogantly he ran there but we are here 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:08.290
 try to circle one patch 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:10.450
 to make it clear where we are from 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.209
 Who is coming 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.620
 I still do not rush to Tomsk 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:17.769
 all cut down though 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:21.489
 goes just gorgeous and so and for now not 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:24.790
 I understand 11 guns now in my hands I'm all 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:27.190
 still in the first place 01 I was killed by another 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:30.790
 one beat me in the back his other in the back 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:32.320
 beat and we are at the very end of this 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:35.380
 the cards were right there 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:39.040
 here for some reason here in this parking 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:41.560
 something somehow nobody in my opinion is all 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.900
 a move occurs in that building 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:46.990
 I wonder what the last gun is here 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.370
 I hope no on style mv3 remember there 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.490
 joe allen was 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:55.030
 go and try to hit though politics 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:58.300
 Khanty killed me from him hitting the visor 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:03.100
 by chance I passed by the houses 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:06.310
 interesting point so dude saw 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:08.860
 that year also climbed to resemble 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:11.620
 this penny between two buildings that 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:14.410
 can oh I found a bunch of hardware could not 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:16.330
 to find . you were there he remembered somewhere 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:19.060
 it seems up climbed something like always 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:23.320
 will finish on the map our husbands went well 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:25.990
 and you're dead, and I had 15 gun 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:28.210
 what is interesting the last 20 of them so here 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:33.070
 here he again runs with a huge 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:37.539
 a machine gun and as I understand the last here 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:42.100
 the gun is not a gun is a knife and that 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:44.680
 guns 18 that run me up to someone and 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:51.340
 Charging here that's found guaranteed 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:54.639
 the back is fine how it happens with 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:57.580
 the sea than suddenly took and ran google 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:06:01.840
 turned around what happened 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:04.740
 okay attempt number 2 in the afternoon here even there 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:08.200
 speed big try it 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:11.169
 finish off again did not be done here 

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:14.620
 and there is no need to look for someone 

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:16.630
 still but agree it is not jeff lynne there 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:21.390
 In general, the full random was here all 

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:24.690
 depends on me on stealth mike 

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:27.630
 and speed is where the main thread is to crouch 

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:32.630
 lean out quickly and tidy up 

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:36.210
 anyone else we have the opportunity 

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:38.520
 13 as I understand only the gun at the second 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:41.550
 who follow me so we eat on the lights there 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:45.230
 someone is shot between corpses see 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:47.610
 and this victory victory was given to us 

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:51.870
 easy enough 

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:55.200
 share is a class that you do not drink either 

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:57.900
 just so lucky with me 

00:06:55.200 --> 00:07:00.420
 now life and what are your friends 

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:02.690
 tell because the next 

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:05.730
 release will be again about because 

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:08.460
 those who do not like can skip 

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:11.840
 because after one will again kolda 

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.840
 as always 

00:07:22.849 --> 00:07:25.149
 there's 

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:28.849
 buy
