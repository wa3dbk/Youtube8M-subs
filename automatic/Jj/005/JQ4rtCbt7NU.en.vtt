00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
it's super fun

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.460 
it's super fun
so<00:01:44.729> with<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.000> solar<00:01:45.299> energy<00:01:45.540> does<00:01:45.930> a<00:01:45.960> Sun<00:01:46.259> have

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
so with the solar energy does a Sun have

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.230 
so with the solar energy does a Sun have
to<00:01:46.590> be<00:01:46.710> hitting<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:47.040> directly<00:01:47.549> or<00:01:47.700> how<00:01:48.060> does

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
to be hitting it directly or how does

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.880 
to be hitting it directly or how does
that<00:01:48.270> work<00:01:48.479> no<00:01:48.960> it<00:01:48.990> doesn't<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.649> you<00:01:49.680> gets

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
that work no it doesn't and you gets

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.219 
that work no it doesn't and you gets
powered<00:01:50.189> on<00:01:50.340> cloudy<00:01:50.790> days<00:01:50.939> as<00:01:51.270> well<00:01:51.450> so<00:01:52.049> it's

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
powered on cloudy days as well so it's

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.600 
powered on cloudy days as well so it's
really<00:01:52.439> nice<00:01:52.649> you<00:01:52.680> don't<00:01:52.950> necessarily<00:01:53.460> have

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
really nice you don't necessarily have

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.429 
really nice you don't necessarily have
to<00:01:53.640> have<00:01:53.759> bright<00:01:54.090> California<00:01:54.720> sunshine<00:01:55.170> to

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
your day is overcharging how many

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.389 
your day is overcharging how many
milliamp<00:02:07.789> sardis<00:02:08.239> the<00:02:09.080> smaller<00:02:09.349> one<00:02:09.560> is<00:02:09.590> 1600

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
milliamp sardis the smaller one is 1600

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.070 
milliamp sardis the smaller one is 1600
milliamps<00:02:11.030> so<00:02:11.120> that's<00:02:11.360> gonna<00:02:11.510> last<00:02:11.750> you<00:02:11.959> about

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
milliamps so that's gonna last you about

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.199 
milliamps so that's gonna last you about
8<00:02:12.440> to<00:02:12.620> 10<00:02:12.770> hours<00:02:12.950> depending<00:02:13.430> on<00:02:13.520> how<00:02:13.580> much<00:02:13.849> how

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
8 to 10 hours depending on how much how

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:15.930 
8 to 10 hours depending on how much how
much<00:02:14.360> you<00:02:14.720> know<00:02:14.840> how<00:02:15.019> much<00:02:15.170> volume<00:02:15.530> you're

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
much you know how much volume you're

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.280 
much you know how much volume you're
packing<00:02:16.940> there<00:02:17.120> and<00:02:17.300> then<00:02:17.690> the<00:02:17.810> bigger<00:02:17.989> one<00:02:18.170> is

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
packing there and then the bigger one is

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.280 
packing there and then the bigger one is
6600<00:02:19.220> milliamps<00:02:19.760> so<00:02:19.790> a<00:02:19.940> ton<00:02:20.420> of<00:02:20.690> a<00:02:20.810> time<00:02:21.110> on

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
6600 milliamps so a ton of a time on

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.930 
6600 milliamps so a ton of a time on
this<00:02:21.440> yeah<00:02:21.620> they're<00:02:22.040> both<00:02:22.160> Bluetooth<00:02:22.670> enabled

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
this yeah they're both Bluetooth enabled

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.759 
this yeah they're both Bluetooth enabled
but<00:02:23.269> they<00:02:23.360> also<00:02:23.480> have<00:02:23.690> auxilary<00:02:24.050> in<00:02:24.349> so<00:02:24.650> if<00:02:24.709> you

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
but they also have auxilary in so if you

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:26.080 
but they also have auxilary in so if you
don't<00:02:24.950> have<00:02:25.069> a<00:02:25.099> bluetooth<00:02:25.489> enabled<00:02:25.700> device

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
don't have a bluetooth enabled device

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.520 
don't have a bluetooth enabled device
you<00:02:26.269> can<00:02:26.390> use<00:02:26.540> that<00:02:26.690> and<00:02:26.900> they<00:02:26.959> also<00:02:27.080> have<00:02:27.260> NFC

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
you can use that and they also have NFC

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.620 
you can use that and they also have NFC
pairing<00:02:28.040> so<00:02:28.220> if<00:02:28.310> your<00:02:28.400> vice<00:02:28.580> is<00:02:28.610> NFC<00:02:29.150> pairing

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
pairing so if your vice is NFC pairing

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.479 
pairing so if your vice is NFC pairing
you<00:02:29.780> can<00:02:29.930> easily<00:02:30.200> just<00:02:30.380> put<00:02:30.890> your<00:02:30.980> device<00:02:31.220> over

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
you can easily just put your device over

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.400 
you can easily just put your device over
it<00:02:31.790> and<00:02:32.030> it<00:02:32.180> will<00:02:32.269> pair<00:02:32.569> automatically<00:02:33.230> or

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
it and it will pair automatically or

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.500 
it and it will pair automatically or
it's<00:02:33.590> one<00:02:33.830> touch<00:02:34.069> easy<00:02:34.099> and<00:02:34.670> bluetooth

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
it's one touch easy and bluetooth

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.309 
it's one touch easy and bluetooth
pairing<00:02:35.750> it's<00:02:36.140> also<00:02:36.319> bluetooth<00:02:36.800> 4.0<00:02:37.310> which<00:02:37.819> is

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
pairing it's also bluetooth 4.0 which is

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:40.930 
pairing it's also bluetooth 4.0 which is
automatically<00:02:39.319> pairs<00:02:39.680> this<00:02:40.310> with<00:02:40.670> your

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
automatically pairs this with your

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.850 
automatically pairs this with your
device<00:02:41.239> so<00:02:41.480> that<00:02:41.510> the<00:02:41.690> volume<00:02:42.019> controls<00:02:42.500> syncs

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
device so that the volume controls syncs

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.920 
device so that the volume controls syncs
up<00:02:43.040> between<00:02:43.340> the<00:02:43.519> two<00:02:43.549> all<00:02:44.360> right<00:02:44.480> very<00:02:44.690> nice

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
up between the two all right very nice

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.330 
up between the two all right very nice
