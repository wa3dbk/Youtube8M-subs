00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
think it is critical for us to

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.709 
think it is critical for us to
understand<00:00:42.930> that<00:00:44.000> Guantanamo<00:00:45.000> is<00:00:45.180> not

necessary to keep America safe it is

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:56.770 
necessary to keep America safe it is
expensive<00:00:50.309> it<00:00:51.030> is<00:00:52.399> inefficient<00:00:53.719> it<00:00:55.399> hurts<00:00:56.399> us

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
expensive it is inefficient it hurts us

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.270 
expensive it is inefficient it hurts us
in<00:00:57.780> terms<00:00:57.960> of<00:00:58.109> our<00:00:58.230> international<00:00:58.559> standing

in terms of our international standing

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.029 
in terms of our international standing
it<00:00:59.640> lessens<00:01:00.149> cooperation<00:01:01.109> with<00:01:01.620> our<00:01:01.649> allies

a hard case to make because you know I

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.289 
a hard case to make because you know I
think<00:02:46.860> for<00:02:47.130> a<00:02:47.160> lot<00:02:47.310> of<00:02:47.370> Americans<00:02:47.850> the<00:02:48.000> notion

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
is out of sight out of mind and it's

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.820 
is out of sight out of mind and it's
easy<00:02:51.239> to<00:02:51.420> demagogue<00:02:51.810> the<00:02:52.019> issue<00:02:52.140> that's<00:02:52.650> what

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
easy to demagogue the issue that's what

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.550 
easy to demagogue the issue that's what
happened<00:02:53.160> the<00:02:53.819> first<00:02:54.000> time<00:02:54.150> this<00:02:54.450> came<00:02:54.660> up<00:02:54.690> i'm

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
happened the first time this came up i'm

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.440 
happened the first time this came up i'm
going<00:02:55.620> to<00:02:55.980> go<00:02:56.069> back<00:02:56.100> at<00:02:56.430> it<00:02:56.459> because<00:02:57.150> i<00:02:57.390> think

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
going to go back at it because i think

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.490 
going to go back at it because i think
it's<00:02:57.660> important<00:02:58.700> for<00:02:59.700> street<00:03:00.000> so<00:03:00.989> i<00:03:01.019> don't<00:03:01.380> i

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
it's important for street so i don't i

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.880 
it's important for street so i don't i
don't<00:03:01.680> want<00:03:01.920> these<00:03:02.010> individuals<00:03:02.549> to<00:03:02.700> die

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
don't want these individuals to die

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.910 
don't want these individuals to die
obviously<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:05.370> pentagon<00:03:05.820> is<00:03:06.600> is<00:03:07.410> trying<00:03:07.829> to

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
obviously the pentagon is is trying to

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.720 
obviously the pentagon is is trying to
manage<00:03:08.220> the<00:03:08.340> situation<00:03:08.549> as<00:03:08.970> best<00:03:09.150> as<00:03:09.359> they<00:03:09.390> can

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
manage the situation as best as they can

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.750 
manage the situation as best as they can
but<00:03:11.730> i<00:03:12.030> think<00:03:12.420> all<00:03:13.350> of<00:03:13.410> us<00:03:13.799> should<00:03:13.890> reflect<00:03:14.370> on

but i think all of us should reflect on

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.770 
but i think all of us should reflect on
why<00:03:15.480> exactly<00:03:15.840> are<00:03:16.049> we<00:03:16.170> doing<00:03:16.380> this<00:03:17.600> why<00:03:18.600> are<00:03:18.630> we

over<00:04:31.220> a<00:04:31.340> decade<00:04:31.760> out<00:04:32.410> we<00:04:33.410> should<00:04:33.590> be<00:04:33.740> wiser<00:04:34.330> we

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
over a decade out we should be wiser we

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.430 
over a decade out we should be wiser we

should have more experience in how we
prosecute<00:04:39.730> terrorists<00:04:40.730> and<00:04:41.919> this<00:04:42.919> is<00:04:43.250> a

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 
prosecute terrorists and this is a

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:50.710 
prosecute terrorists and this is a
lingering<00:04:47.020> problem<00:04:48.460> that<00:04:49.460> is<00:04:50.270> not<00:04:50.540> going<00:04:50.660> to

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 
lingering problem that is not going to

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:51.880 
lingering problem that is not going to
get<00:04:50.900> better<00:04:51.020> it's<00:04:51.440> going<00:04:51.650> to<00:04:51.710> get<00:04:51.830> worse

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:51.890 
get better it's going to get worse

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:55.270 
get better it's going to get worse
that's<00:04:52.820> going<00:04:52.940> to<00:04:53.000> fester<00:04:53.590> and<00:04:54.590> so<00:04:54.950> I'm<00:04:55.070> going

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
that's going to fester and so I'm going
