 it will probably be very useful for you 

00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:12.700
 in this application which is called 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:15.250
 people this application allows you to 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.439

 information from your various accounts 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:22.240
 for example from facebook 

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:24.580
 from twitter well from other social networks 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.900
 in order to connect your account 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:32.259
 just choose for example facebook 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:39.790
 I hire to connect further I enter the address 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:43.360
 email and password I click to enter 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:45.659
 and see that I have a floor here 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.430
 the information already has my avatar 

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:49.659
 click ok 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.089
 here the situation is we are with you 

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:54.820
 connect to facebook and facebook 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:57.369
 notifies us that microsoft wants 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.350
 get access to some of our data 

00:00:57.369 --> 00:01:01.390
 account on facebook, respectively, we 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.949
 just with this whole thing agree for 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.070
 order to provide the program 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:08.470
 access to this information in this way 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.270
 connecting all your social networks you 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.000
 can get quick access to 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.430
 information about the people that you are with 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.290
 communicate in them for example here you can 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.660
 select for example the option all contacts and 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.340
 information will be displayed in all 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.290
 contacts that you have in 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.120
 social networks well in my case I 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.040
 just connected facebook 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.190
 accordingly i can choose some 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.380
 contact in contact with contact on skype 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.690
 send messages in skype or do 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.790
 video call and so on, that is, you 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.590
 can receive from one program 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.330
 access to all your contacts who 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.760
 are for example on twitter on facebook 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.340
 and so on to tell the truth i don't 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.140
 I tried to connect Russian networks here 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.620
 such as vkontakte not sure what it is 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:54.520
 It turns out but you can see the parameters 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:56.979
 what we have here is apparently no 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.110
 here you can add only twitter 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:02.049
 google a linked in 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.210
 and some other social networks blindly 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:06.340
 vkontakte can't be added here but 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.960
 nevertheless and even from facebook 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.560
 twitter you can import here 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.660
 contacts and get to your friends 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.560
 faster access using this 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.849
 programs 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.220
 the next program that we are with you 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:20.650
 consider this program skydrive 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.090
 I already told him about this application 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.370
 new allows you to sync 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.620
 information which is in some 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.830
 your folders on a computer with a remote 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:32.110
 server company microsoft now I'm 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.450
 I close the application and go to the worker 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.330
 table and let's run the program 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.550
 the explorer in explorer has a whole folder 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.430
 which is called skydrive more precisely 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.680
 no folder is a section in the navigation area 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:48.610
 in this folder we have a daddy 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.560
 documents and image daddy type 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.510
 our feet will be synchronized with 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.280
 remote service we can 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.090
 for example in these folders to copy 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.590
 some files that we will have 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.420
 synchronize with remote service 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.540
 and we will have the same access to them 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.319
 from any device that connects 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.370
 to skydrive 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:11.560
 the same can be done here 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.989
 to a large extent this is nothing but 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.400
 display of the same folders that we 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:17.500
 just seen with you in the program 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.140
 the conductor here is displayed 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.150
 information about those folders there and 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.950
 what will happen to us 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.690
 sync like any other 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.930
 another application that has 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:31.780
 metro interface there are options 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:34.269
 which relate only to this 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.340
 there is an opportunity for us here 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:39.010
 get offline access to all 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.630
 files but is disabled by default and on 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.180
 in fact it is right if its 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.609
 enable it means it will 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.389
 lost the very idea of ​​this service 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:48.819
 skydrive 

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:50.680
 there are also additional 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:51.940
 parameters that are in the parameters 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.510
 computer let's click on this 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:57.489
 Ssylochku we'll talk later about 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.200
 computer settings but for now 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:00.519
 see what settings have 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.680
 skydrive programs 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:05.319
 by default you see what is available to us 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.209
 7 gigabytes per remote service when 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:09.310
 you can instead buy 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:12.160
 here you can see those files 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:14.650
 which you have already loaded 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.780
 on the service but by and large a window like 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.300
 you saw split and we just 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.100
 displays information from the program 

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:23.590
 skydrive 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:25.780
 let's go back to full screen again 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:28.780
 well, here we have information 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:31.120
 on film the film is that folder which 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.830
 we were in the image folder in this 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.750
 folder 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.820
 usually photos are downloaded when you 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.040
 connect some device with 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.630
 which can take pictures 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:44.140
 whether to record video there camcorder 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.880
 phone smartphone on tablet camera 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:48.030
 and so on here we can 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.350
 configure download only skydrive 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:53.440
 photos or video and in what capacity 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:55.150
 download them next section is me 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.310
 synchronization of parameters here we are with you 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.650
 we can choose which parameters 100 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:02.080
 sync and which are not well by 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.540
 The default is almost all 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:08.110
 the information is synchronized as I have already 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:09.850
 we said skydrive is not only 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.250
 service for storing your files 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:13.960
 but also the service that allows you 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:16.120
 save your operating room settings 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:19.180
 system that is your personal 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.460
 settings and just here we are with you 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:24.940
 we can set up business here we can 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:26.830
 you sync for example tiles on 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.740
 initial screen yes that is like them 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:31.690
 location like we have on this one 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:34.480
 computer will also be like 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:35.919
 on a laptop or on your tablet and of 

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:38.380
 so on here are many different 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:40.750
 parameters that you can enable 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:42.310
 or disable and accordingly all these 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.590
 operating system settings and 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:46.210
 programs that are installed by default 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:48.610
 in the operating system they will 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:50.860
 synchronize and will also 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:52.600
 boot to that device on which 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:53.890
 with whom you also work on which 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.940
 an operating system is also installed 

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:57.160
 windows 8 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.970
 there is still some section of the limit 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.160
 connect 

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:02.620
 I think that this section is not particularly relevant 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:05.620
 because it is intended for those u 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:07.840
 whom I understand limited internet 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:09.700
 limited either by traffic ie by 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:12.190
 the amount of data transferred or 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:14.550
 speed this parameter is basically possible 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:14.550
 ignore
