00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
dan won't help cuz this is the stand leg

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.730 
dan won't help cuz this is the stand leg
which<00:02:17.460> doesn't<00:02:18.360> even<00:02:18.569> help<00:02:19.110> it<00:02:19.290> at<00:02:19.380> all<00:02:19.500> it's

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
which doesn't even help it at all it's

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.990 
which doesn't even help it at all it's
just<00:02:19.860> a<00:02:20.250> floppy<00:02:20.550> leg<00:02:21.050> so<00:02:22.370> if<00:02:23.370> you<00:02:23.520> want<00:02:23.760> this

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
just a floppy leg so if you want this

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.140 
just a floppy leg so if you want this
figure<00:02:24.510> to<00:02:25.170> fix<00:02:25.410> standing<00:02:26.370> problems<00:02:26.819> that'll

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
figure to fix standing problems that'll

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.270 
figure to fix standing problems that'll
it'll<00:02:27.450> probably<00:02:27.810> work<00:02:27.990> because<00:02:28.650> these<00:02:28.980> legs

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
it'll probably work because these legs

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.940 
it'll probably work because these legs
are<00:02:29.430> not<00:02:30.180> really<00:02:30.450> floppy<00:02:30.690> there<00:02:31.140> you<00:02:31.830> can

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
are not really floppy there you can

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.940 
are not really floppy there you can
