front view in this case it's something

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.060 
front view in this case it's something
I'm<00:00:18.360> trying<00:00:18.509> to<00:00:18.660> practice<00:00:18.930> that<00:00:19.590> wealth

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
I'm trying to practice that wealth

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.460 
I'm trying to practice that wealth
drawing<00:00:20.460> faces<00:00:20.699> in<00:00:21.060> general<00:00:21.510> as<00:00:21.690> it's<00:00:22.260> just

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
drawing faces in general as it's just

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.080 
drawing faces in general as it's just
something<00:00:22.859> I<00:00:23.039> would<00:00:23.250> like<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.520> get<00:00:23.670> better<00:00:23.850> and

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
something I would like to get better and

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.880 
something I would like to get better and
it's<00:00:24.270> something<00:00:24.630> that<00:00:24.720> I<00:00:24.750> struggle<00:00:25.109> with<00:00:25.140> so<00:00:25.859> I

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
it's something that I struggle with so I

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.470 
it's something that I struggle with so I
did<00:00:26.100> actually<00:00:26.220> have<00:00:26.490> reference<00:00:26.970> loaded<00:00:27.359> up

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
did actually have reference loaded up

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.000 
did actually have reference loaded up
for<00:00:27.510> thee<00:00:27.779> for<00:00:28.170> each<00:00:28.260> one<00:00:28.470> of<00:00:28.560> these<00:00:28.680> three

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
for thee for each one of these three

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.179 
for thee for each one of these three
images<00:00:29.220> that<00:00:29.519> I<00:00:29.550> draw<00:00:29.789> but<00:00:30.539> I<00:00:31.189> wasn't

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
images that I draw but I wasn't

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.640 
images that I draw but I wasn't
following<00:00:32.610> them<00:00:32.910> exactly<00:00:33.269> I<00:00:33.750> was<00:00:34.350> sort<00:00:34.590> of

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:34.650 
following them exactly I was sort of

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.530 
following them exactly I was sort of
using<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.070> Andrew<00:00:35.309> Loomis<00:00:35.550> drawing<00:00:36.330> a<00:00:36.390> head

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
things like this which you'll actually

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.549 
things like this which you'll actually
see<00:00:55.739> me<00:00:55.920> do<00:00:56.120> before<00:00:57.120> I<00:00:57.360> draw<00:00:57.570> each<00:00:57.719> face<00:00:58.020> I<00:00:58.260> draw

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
see me do before I draw each face I draw

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.619 
see me do before I draw each face I draw
it<00:00:58.710> as<00:00:58.800> like<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:58.949> template<00:00:59.699> or<00:00:59.940> maybe<00:01:00.149> you<00:01:00.510> know

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
it as like a template or maybe you know

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.080 
it as like a template or maybe you know
construction<00:01:01.320> lines<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:02.190> do<00:01:02.340> that<00:01:02.520> on<00:01:02.670> on

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
construction lines and to do that on on

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.119 
construction lines and to do that on on
a<00:01:03.270> layer<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:03.809> then<00:01:03.960> I<00:01:04.199> actually<00:01:04.350> do<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.920> main

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
a layer and then I actually do the main

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.910 
a layer and then I actually do the main
face<00:01:05.750> drowning<00:01:06.750> their<00:01:06.930> features<00:01:07.440> and<00:01:07.680> sort<00:01:07.890> of

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
face drowning their features and sort of

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.190 
face drowning their features and sort of
going<00:01:08.190> over<00:01:08.520> it<00:01:08.640> on<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.330> layer<00:01:09.600> above<00:01:09.900> so<00:01:10.080> that<00:01:10.110> I

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
going over it on a layer above so that I

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.929 
going over it on a layer above so that I
can<00:01:10.350> just<00:01:10.500> hide<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.860> layer<00:01:11.040> below<00:01:11.280> just<00:01:11.670> makes

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
can just hide the layer below just makes

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.160 
can just hide the layer below just makes
things<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:12.240> lot<00:01:12.360> easier<00:01:12.420> if<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:12.840> working

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
things a lot easier if you working

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.650 
things a lot easier if you working
digitally<00:01:13.350> like<00:01:13.799> that

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:19.660 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.000 

are<00:01:20.660> you<00:01:20.750> also<00:01:20.930> noticed<00:01:21.410> I<00:01:21.500> started<00:01:21.530> with<00:01:21.980> a

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.010 
are you also noticed I started with a

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.880 
are you also noticed I started with a
white<00:01:22.250> background<00:01:22.610> I<00:01:23.230> was<00:01:24.230> just<00:01:24.470> gonna<00:01:24.560> sketch

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
white background I was just gonna sketch

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.830 
white background I was just gonna sketch
just<00:01:25.130> literally<00:01:25.490> with<00:01:25.580> a<00:01:25.700> black<00:01:25.940> pencil<00:01:26.390> tool

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
just literally with a black pencil tool

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.140 
just literally with a black pencil tool
which<00:01:27.500> you<00:01:27.530> can<00:01:27.860> see<00:01:28.070> how<00:01:28.160> to<00:01:28.220> make<00:01:28.670> that<00:01:28.880> brush

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
which you can see how to make that brush

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.660 
which you can see how to make that brush
in<00:01:29.530> one<00:01:30.530> of<00:01:30.620> my<00:01:30.680> other<00:01:30.800> videos<00:01:31.130> so<00:01:31.160> I'll<00:01:31.460> put<00:01:31.640> a

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
in one of my other videos so I'll put a

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.790 
in one of my other videos so I'll put a
link<00:01:31.850> on<00:01:32.030> screen<00:01:32.180> for<00:01:32.450> that<00:01:32.510> now<00:01:32.770> but<00:01:33.770> I

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
link on screen for that now but I

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.560 
link on screen for that now but I
started<00:01:34.130> with<00:01:34.220> a<00:01:34.250> white<00:01:34.400> background<00:01:34.970> and<00:01:35.270> I

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
started with a white background and I

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.120 
started with a white background and I
decided<00:01:35.930> I'd<00:01:36.140> try<00:01:36.290> and<00:01:36.410> go<00:01:36.620> a<00:01:36.650> little<00:01:36.710> bit<00:01:36.980> more

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
decided I'd try and go a little bit more

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.000 
decided I'd try and go a little bit more
detailed<00:01:37.730> with<00:01:38.360> this<00:01:38.570> and<00:01:38.870> I'd<00:01:39.170> put<00:01:39.650> a<00:01:39.680> gray

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.010 
detailed with this and I'd put a gray

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.550 
detailed with this and I'd put a gray
stop<00:01:40.400> mid<00:01:40.670> turn<00:01:40.940> background<00:01:41.420> on<00:01:41.600> and<00:01:41.810> that

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
stop mid turn background on and that

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.930 
stop mid turn background on and that
meant<00:01:42.740> that<00:01:42.800> I<00:01:42.890> could<00:01:43.160> as<00:01:43.340> well<00:01:43.460> as<00:01:43.520> adding

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
meant that I could as well as adding

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.220 
meant that I could as well as adding
shared<00:01:44.240> into<00:01:44.540> it<00:01:44.660> I<00:01:44.720> could<00:01:44.840> actually<00:01:44.960> add

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:45.230 
shared into it I could actually add

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.890 
shared into it I could actually add
highlights<00:01:45.770> just<00:01:46.520> using<00:01:46.910> a<00:01:47.000> white<00:01:47.210> and<00:01:47.420> it

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
highlights just using a white and it

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.020 
highlights just using a white and it
just<00:01:48.140> it<00:01:48.650> means<00:01:49.280> I<00:01:49.490> can<00:01:49.640> add<00:01:49.730> a<00:01:49.760> bit<00:01:50.000> more

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
just it means I can add a bit more

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.060 
just it means I can add a bit more
detail<00:01:50.630> to<00:01:50.660> it<00:01:50.960> like<00:01:51.110> that<00:01:51.260> so<00:01:51.530> I<00:01:51.590> decided<00:01:51.710> to

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
detail to it like that so I decided to

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.450 
detail to it like that so I decided to
give<00:01:52.190> it<00:01:52.310> a<00:01:52.370> go

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.149 

I<00:01:56.600> will<00:01:57.600> point<00:01:57.810> out<00:01:57.960> straight<00:01:58.770> away<00:01:58.799> that<00:01:59.070> the

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
I will point out straight away that the

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.880 
I will point out straight away that the
first<00:01:59.400> base<00:01:59.760> that<00:01:59.790> I<00:02:00.060> did<00:02:00.590> didn't<00:02:01.590> look<00:02:01.680> all

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
first base that I did didn't look all

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.200 
first base that I did didn't look all
that<00:02:02.040> great<00:02:02.310> there<00:02:02.460> was<00:02:02.520> something<00:02:02.970> slightly

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
that great there was something slightly

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.880 
that great there was something slightly
off<00:02:03.540> about<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:04.020> I<00:02:04.170> couldn't<00:02:04.350> figure<00:02:04.560> out<00:02:04.710> what

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
off about it I couldn't figure out what

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.560 
off about it I couldn't figure out what
it<00:02:04.920> was<00:02:05.100> not<00:02:05.340> sure<00:02:05.460> if<00:02:05.520> it<00:02:05.610> was<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.729> jawline<00:02:06.330> or

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
it was not sure if it was the jawline or

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.620 
it was not sure if it was the jawline or
if<00:02:06.659> I'd<00:02:06.780> stretched<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.350> face<00:02:07.530> out<00:02:07.770> too<00:02:08.009> much

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
if I'd stretched the face out too much

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.969 
if I'd stretched the face out too much
so<00:02:09.630> the<00:02:09.750> first<00:02:09.929> one<00:02:10.110> I<00:02:10.140> wasn't<00:02:10.380> really<00:02:10.709> happy

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
so the first one I wasn't really happy

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.870 
so the first one I wasn't really happy
with<00:02:11.100> but<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.459> other<00:02:11.640> two<00:02:11.790> I<00:02:11.819> was<00:02:12.500> although

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
with but the other two I was although

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.710 
with but the other two I was although
that<00:02:14.880> being<00:02:15.000> said<00:02:15.209> they<00:02:15.330> didn't<00:02:15.569> actually

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
that being said they didn't actually

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.559 
that being said they didn't actually
look<00:02:16.050> that<00:02:16.319> much<00:02:16.560> like<00:02:17.239> sort<00:02:18.239> of<00:02:18.300> like<00:02:18.420> the

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
look that much like sort of like the

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.020 
look that much like sort of like the
reference<00:02:18.989> image<00:02:19.290> but<00:02:19.980> I<00:02:20.010> wasn't<00:02:20.280> too

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
reference image but I wasn't too

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.510 
reference image but I wasn't too
bothered<00:02:21.270> about<00:02:21.480> that<00:02:21.680> as<00:02:22.680> I<00:02:22.739> say<00:02:23.010> I<00:02:23.040> started

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
bothered about that as I say I started

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.920 
bothered about that as I say I started
with<00:02:23.700> that<00:02:23.819> you<00:02:23.940> know<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.209> template<00:02:24.630> using

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
with that you know the template using

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.770 
with that you know the template using
the<00:02:25.080> Andrew<00:02:25.410> Loomis<00:02:25.590> method<00:02:26.190> and<00:02:26.510> then<00:02:27.510> I<00:02:27.540> sort

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
the Andrew Loomis method and then I sort

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.780 
the Andrew Loomis method and then I sort
of<00:02:27.840> just<00:02:27.900> adjusted<00:02:28.590> it<00:02:28.709> slightly<00:02:29.190> too<00:02:29.640> much

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
of just adjusted it slightly too much

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.040 
of just adjusted it slightly too much
the<00:02:29.970> reference<00:02:30.300> a<00:02:30.420> little<00:02:30.630> bit<00:02:30.720> more<00:02:30.870> so<00:02:30.989> it

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
the reference a little bit more so it

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.479 
the reference a little bit more so it
does<00:02:31.200> resemble<00:02:31.500> them<00:02:31.920> but<00:02:32.130> doesn't<00:02:32.430> look

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
does resemble them but doesn't look

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.490 
does resemble them but doesn't look
exactly<00:02:32.820> like<00:02:33.060> them<00:02:33.360> something<00:02:34.050> I<00:02:34.290> find

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
exactly like them something I find

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.870 
exactly like them something I find
really<00:02:34.890> difficult<00:02:35.040> to<00:02:35.459> draw<00:02:35.610> is<00:02:35.670> what<00:02:35.820> I'm

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
really difficult to draw is what I'm

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.120 
really difficult to draw is what I'm
doing<00:02:36.120> here<00:02:36.330> it's<00:02:36.600> the<00:02:36.840> actual<00:02:37.170> drawing<00:02:37.830> the

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
doing here it's the actual drawing the

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.860 
doing here it's the actual drawing the
teeth<00:02:38.400> which<00:02:39.300> I<00:02:41.000> don't<00:02:42.000> know<00:02:42.120> why<00:02:42.300> but<00:02:42.630> it's

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
teeth which I don't know why but it's

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.020 
teeth which I don't know why but it's
just<00:02:43.170> I<00:02:43.260> find<00:02:43.709> it<00:02:43.950> very<00:02:44.220> difficult<00:02:44.459> to<00:02:44.760> draw

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
just I find it very difficult to draw

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.110 
just I find it very difficult to draw
teeth<00:02:45.330> without<00:02:46.140> making<00:02:46.590> them<00:02:46.739> look

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
teeth without making them look

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.470 
teeth without making them look
ridiculously<00:02:48.120> goofy<00:02:48.769> so<00:02:49.769> but<00:02:50.670> coincidentally

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
ridiculously goofy so but coincidentally

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.570 
ridiculously goofy so but coincidentally
I<00:02:51.930> think<00:02:52.170> all<00:02:52.350> three<00:02:52.560> of<00:02:52.680> these<00:02:52.860> images<00:02:53.370> that<00:02:53.550> I

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
I think all three of these images that I

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.880 
I think all three of these images that I
draw<00:02:53.790> end<00:02:54.060> up<00:02:54.600> showing<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:55.019> teeth<00:02:55.230> so<00:02:55.590> maybe

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
draw end up showing the teeth so maybe

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.590 
draw end up showing the teeth so maybe
not<00:02:56.069> the<00:02:56.190> best<00:02:56.400> choice<00:02:56.489> of<00:02:56.880> images<00:02:57.180> for<00:02:57.330> me<00:02:57.420> to

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
not the best choice of images for me to

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.170 
not the best choice of images for me to
choose<00:02:57.810> but<00:02:58.220> it's<00:02:59.220> all<00:02:59.370> practice<00:02:59.819> so<00:02:59.970> it's<00:03:00.090> all

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
choose but it's all practice so it's all

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.910 
choose but it's all practice so it's all
good<00:03:00.390> and<00:03:00.630> I<00:03:00.690> think<00:03:01.350> they<00:03:01.440> turned<00:03:01.500> out<00:03:01.769> all

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
good and I think they turned out all

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.630 
good and I think they turned out all
right<00:03:01.950> as<00:03:02.190> well

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.809 

as<00:03:06.480> far<00:03:06.750> as<00:03:06.780> pain<00:03:07.740> in<00:03:07.920> hair<00:03:08.100> I'll<00:03:08.280> draw<00:03:08.490> in<00:03:08.670> her

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
as far as pain in hair I'll draw in her

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:13.340 
as far as pain in hair I'll draw in her
I<00:03:09.090> do<00:03:09.630> find<00:03:10.140> it<00:03:10.319> hard<00:03:10.560> to<00:03:10.709> saw<00:03:11.370> sketch<00:03:12.350> and

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
I do find it hard to saw sketch and

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.070 
I do find it hard to saw sketch and
shared<00:03:14.040> like<00:03:14.670> the<00:03:15.360> method<00:03:15.720> that<00:03:15.780> I'm<00:03:15.900> using

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
shared like the method that I'm using

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.330 
shared like the method that I'm using
for<00:03:16.319> shared<00:03:16.500> in<00:03:16.650> here<00:03:16.800> is<00:03:16.920> like<00:03:16.950> cross

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
for shared in here is like cross

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.550 
for shared in here is like cross
hatching<00:03:17.819> though<00:03:18.330> if<00:03:18.450> you<00:03:18.569> do<00:03:18.720> that<00:03:18.930> on<00:03:19.170> hair

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
hatching though if you do that on hair

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.070 
hatching though if you do that on hair
against<00:03:20.010> strands<00:03:20.340> of<00:03:20.640> hair<00:03:20.819> it<00:03:21.420> doesn't<00:03:21.840> seem

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
against strands of hair it doesn't seem

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.770 
against strands of hair it doesn't seem
to<00:03:22.290> look<00:03:22.470> right<00:03:22.709> so<00:03:22.770> I<00:03:23.490> just<00:03:24.090> used<00:03:24.300> that<00:03:24.480> I<00:03:24.630> just

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
to look right so I just used that I just

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.780 
to look right so I just used that I just
met<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.170> the<00:03:25.740> pencil<00:03:26.070> brush<00:03:26.220> slightly<00:03:26.370> bigger

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
met the the pencil brush slightly bigger

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.760 
met the the pencil brush slightly bigger
to<00:03:27.030> block<00:03:27.270> in<00:03:27.480> a<00:03:27.600> bit<00:03:27.720> of<00:03:27.750> a<00:03:27.840> darker<00:03:28.230> tone<00:03:28.410> first

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.770 
to block in a bit of a darker tone first

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:30.920 
to block in a bit of a darker tone first
and<00:03:29.070> then<00:03:29.160> I<00:03:29.190> just<00:03:29.430> tried<00:03:29.640> out<00:03:29.670> in<00:03:29.820> some<00:03:30.150> single

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
and then I just tried out in some single

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.479 
and then I just tried out in some single
strokes<00:03:31.260> to<00:03:31.590> give<00:03:31.739> the<00:03:31.830> impression<00:03:32.010> of<00:03:32.280> hair

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
strokes to give the impression of hair

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.670 
strokes to give the impression of hair
on<00:03:33.420> this<00:03:33.690> second<00:03:34.140> image<00:03:34.230> that<00:03:34.470> I'm<00:03:34.530> drawing

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
on this second image that I'm drawing

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.800 
on this second image that I'm drawing
here<00:03:34.770> it<00:03:35.580> doesn't<00:03:36.000> work<00:03:36.120> all<00:03:36.270> that<00:03:36.450> great<00:03:36.780> but

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
here it doesn't work all that great but

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.960 
here it doesn't work all that great but
it's<00:03:37.709> acceptable<00:03:38.190> it<00:03:38.400> could<00:03:38.580> have<00:03:38.700> been<00:03:38.790> worse

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
it's acceptable it could have been worse

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.580 
it's acceptable it could have been worse
I<00:03:39.300> think<00:03:39.330> the<00:03:39.570> third<00:03:39.750> one<00:03:39.780> looks<00:03:40.140> a<00:03:40.260> little<00:03:40.380> bit

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
I think the third one looks a little bit

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:41.990 
I think the third one looks a little bit
better<00:03:40.709> so<00:03:41.250> you<00:03:41.340> can<00:03:41.370> see<00:03:41.550> me<00:03:41.670> drawing<00:03:41.850> the

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
better so you can see me drawing the

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.140 
better so you can see me drawing the
template<00:03:42.450> now<00:03:42.630> for<00:03:42.930> the<00:03:43.020> third<00:03:43.260> face<00:03:44.150> pretty

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
template now for the third face pretty

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.330 
template now for the third face pretty
much<00:03:45.330> very<00:03:45.959> similar<00:03:46.050> to<00:03:46.500> the<00:03:46.620> same<00:03:46.860> as<00:03:47.100> what

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
much very similar to the same as what

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.220 
much very similar to the same as what
I've<00:03:47.430> drawn<00:03:47.670> for<00:03:47.700> for<00:03:48.450> the<00:03:48.510> other<00:03:48.630> two<00:03:48.810> faces

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
I've drawn for for the other two faces

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.810 
I've drawn for for the other two faces
as<00:03:49.350> well<00:03:49.530> I<00:03:51.019> think<00:03:52.019> that<00:03:52.320> the<00:03:53.010> first<00:03:53.310> face<00:03:53.790> that

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
as well I think that the first face that

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.470 
as well I think that the first face that
I<00:03:54.150> drew<00:03:54.360> took<00:03:54.870> about<00:03:55.200> an<00:03:55.440> hour<00:03:55.560> and<00:03:56.060> the<00:03:57.060> second

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
I drew took about an hour and the second

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.110 
I drew took about an hour and the second
one<00:03:58.250> maybe<00:03:59.250> an<00:03:59.400> hour<00:03:59.519> and<00:03:59.610> a<00:03:59.670> half<00:03:59.820> to<00:03:59.970> two

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
one maybe an hour and a half to two

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.880 
one maybe an hour and a half to two
hours<00:04:00.180> and<00:04:00.570> this<00:04:00.660> third<00:04:00.900> one<00:04:01.140> maybe<00:04:01.620> a<00:04:01.739> little

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
hours and this third one maybe a little

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.160 
hours and this third one maybe a little
bit<00:04:02.070> of<00:04:02.160> a<00:04:02.250> through<00:04:02.510> three<00:04:03.510> I<00:04:03.540> was<00:04:03.720> over<00:04:03.959> two

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
bit of a through three I was over two

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.690 
bit of a through three I was over two
hours<00:04:04.320> sorry<00:04:04.739> so<00:04:05.870> it<00:04:06.870> does<00:04:07.500> kind<00:04:07.800> of<00:04:07.890> show<00:04:08.100> seen

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
hours sorry so it does kind of show seen

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.190 
hours sorry so it does kind of show seen
as<00:04:08.820> I<00:04:08.880> spent<00:04:09.120> half<00:04:09.330> the<00:04:09.510> time<00:04:09.720> in<00:04:09.870> the<00:04:09.959> first

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
as I spent half the time in the first

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.630 
as I spent half the time in the first
one<00:04:10.440> that<00:04:10.590> one<00:04:10.739> didn't<00:04:11.010> turn<00:04:11.130> out<00:04:11.370> right<00:04:11.579> I

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
one that one didn't turn out right I

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.030 
one that one didn't turn out right I
should<00:04:11.910> have<00:04:11.940> probably<00:04:12.480> stuck<00:04:13.290> to<00:04:13.500> it<00:04:13.709> maybe

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
should have probably stuck to it maybe

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.400 
should have probably stuck to it maybe
adjusted<00:04:15.000> it<00:04:15.090> more<00:04:15.269> fixed<00:04:15.660> it<00:04:15.780> up<00:04:15.810> a<00:04:15.959> bit

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
adjusted it more fixed it up a bit

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.710 
adjusted it more fixed it up a bit
a<00:04:16.440> little<00:04:16.799> bit<00:04:16.890> too<00:04:17.040> late<00:04:17.250> now<00:04:17.430> but<00:04:17.729> I'm<00:04:18.299> happy

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
a little bit too late now but I'm happy

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.479 
a little bit too late now but I'm happy
with<00:04:18.840> this<00:04:19.260> last<00:04:19.470> one<00:04:19.709> was<00:04:19.829> my<00:04:19.979> favorite<00:04:20.400> this

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
with this last one was my favorite this

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.580 
with this last one was my favorite this
one<00:04:20.549> turned<00:04:20.880> out<00:04:21.060> the<00:04:21.180> best<00:04:21.329> and<00:04:21.600> even<00:04:22.229> looked

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
one turned out the best and even looked

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.380 
one turned out the best and even looked
the<00:04:23.160> most<00:04:23.310> like<00:04:23.490> the<00:04:23.640> reference<00:04:24.120> that<00:04:24.270> was

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
the most like the reference that was

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.900 
the most like the reference that was
following<00:04:24.750> one<00:04:25.500> thing<00:04:25.770> that<00:04:25.950> I<00:04:25.979> find<00:04:26.280> really

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
following one thing that I find really

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.880 
following one thing that I find really
helps<00:04:27.330> or<00:04:27.510> bring<00:04:27.780> a<00:04:27.870> face<00:04:28.080> to<00:04:28.320> life<00:04:28.470> and<00:04:28.800> make

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890 
helps or bring a face to life and make

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:30.440 
helps or bring a face to life and make
it<00:04:29.040> look<00:04:29.160> more<00:04:29.580> realistic<00:04:29.970> and<00:04:30.240> just

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
it look more realistic and just

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.219 
it look more realistic and just
generally<00:04:30.870> adds<00:04:31.110> a<00:04:31.260> lot<00:04:31.470> of<00:04:31.530> detail<00:04:32.070> is<00:04:32.840> on<00:04:33.840> the

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:34.229 
generally adds a lot of detail is on the

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:35.600 
generally adds a lot of detail is on the
eyes<00:04:34.350> which<00:04:34.680> I'm<00:04:34.800> working<00:04:35.040> on<00:04:35.100> as<00:04:35.250> you<00:04:35.340> can<00:04:35.490> see

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
eyes which I'm working on as you can see

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.900 
eyes which I'm working on as you can see
here<00:04:35.850> adding<00:04:36.390> a<00:04:36.570> white<00:04:36.870> highlight<00:04:37.229> to<00:04:37.710> them

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 
here adding a white highlight to them

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.430 
here adding a white highlight to them
really<00:04:38.910> just<00:04:39.030> improves<00:04:39.450> the<00:04:39.600> overall<00:04:39.630> look<00:04:40.110> in

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
really just improves the overall look in

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.650 
really just improves the overall look in
my<00:04:40.590> opinion<00:04:41.010> and<00:04:41.190> it's<00:04:41.940> one<00:04:42.120> of<00:04:42.240> them<00:04:42.360> things

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
my opinion and it's one of them things

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.280 
my opinion and it's one of them things
where<00:04:42.870> less<00:04:43.830> is<00:04:44.040> more<00:04:44.310> so<00:04:45.120> you<00:04:45.840> don't<00:04:45.870> want<00:04:46.200> to

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290 
where less is more so you don't want to

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.050 
where less is more so you don't want to
overdo<00:04:46.530> it<00:04:46.650> and<00:04:46.830> do<00:04:46.919> a<00:04:46.950> huge<00:04:47.280> highlight<00:04:47.790> I<00:04:47.820> mean

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
overdo it and do a huge highlight I mean

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.760 
overdo it and do a huge highlight I mean
on<00:04:48.180> this<00:04:48.300> face<00:04:48.539> here<00:04:48.750> they<00:04:49.169> are<00:04:49.320> pretty<00:04:49.620> big

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
on this face here they are pretty big

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.850 
on this face here they are pretty big
highlights<00:04:50.539> but<00:04:51.539> so<00:04:52.200> I<00:04:52.229> wouldn't<00:04:52.470> go<00:04:52.560> any<00:04:52.740> more

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
highlights but so I wouldn't go any more

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.219 
highlights but so I wouldn't go any more
than<00:04:53.039> that<00:04:53.190> but<00:04:53.580> it<00:04:53.970> really<00:04:54.390> does<00:04:54.690> improve<00:04:54.810> the

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:55.229 
than that but it really does improve the

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:58.250 
than that but it really does improve the
overall<00:04:55.260> image<00:04:56.160> I<00:04:56.669> don't<00:04:57.660> think<00:04:57.870> I<00:04:57.900> show<00:04:58.050> it<00:04:58.169> in

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.260 
overall image I don't think I show it in

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:59.990 
overall image I don't think I show it in
the<00:04:58.350> video<00:04:58.590> but<00:04:58.650> if<00:04:58.890> I<00:04:59.010> was<00:04:59.160> to<00:04:59.310> hide<00:04:59.520> the<00:04:59.820> layer

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
the video but if I was to hide the layer

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.909 
the video but if I was to hide the layer
that<00:05:00.240> stopped<00:05:00.479> them<00:05:00.630> on<00:05:00.780> the<00:05:01.110> highlights<00:05:01.530> on<00:05:01.710> a

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 
that stopped them on the highlights on a

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:05.330 
that stopped them on the highlights on a
straightaway<00:05:02.910> it<00:05:03.810> looks<00:05:04.140> so<00:05:04.440> different<00:05:04.650> so

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
straightaway it looks so different so

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.960 
straightaway it looks so different so
always<00:05:05.970> remember<00:05:06.210> to<00:05:06.450> do<00:05:06.630> the<00:05:06.750> highlights<00:05:07.110> and

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970 
always remember to do the highlights and

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.310 
always remember to do the highlights and
yeah<00:05:08.970> that's<00:05:09.210> pretty<00:05:09.270> much<00:05:09.510> it<00:05:09.600> really<00:05:09.990> so

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 
yeah that's pretty much it really so

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.710 
yeah that's pretty much it really so
here<00:05:10.530> I<00:05:10.620> am<00:05:10.740> just<00:05:11.250> you<00:05:12.150> know<00:05:12.240> drawing<00:05:12.479> it<00:05:12.630> from

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
here I am just you know drawing it from

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.900 
here I am just you know drawing it from
the<00:05:12.900> front<00:05:13.080> view<00:05:13.229> I<00:05:13.590> think<00:05:14.340> if<00:05:14.430> I<00:05:14.520> was<00:05:14.640> going<00:05:14.700> to

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
the front view I think if I was going to

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:19.260 
the front view I think if I was going to
do<00:05:15.080> side<00:05:16.080> view<00:05:16.289> our<00:05:16.440> 3/4<00:05:17.220> view<00:05:18.169> definitely

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
do side view our 3/4 view definitely

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:20.760 
do side view our 3/4 view definitely
would<00:05:19.479> definitely<00:05:19.840> struggle<00:05:20.169> a<00:05:20.259> lot<00:05:20.500> more<00:05:20.680> of

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
would definitely struggle a lot more of

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.140 
would definitely struggle a lot more of
a<00:05:20.860> three-quarter<00:05:21.490> view<00:05:21.610> it'd<00:05:21.759> probably<00:05:21.849> take

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
a three-quarter view it'd probably take

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.240 
a three-quarter view it'd probably take
me<00:05:22.270> a<00:05:22.330> lot<00:05:22.479> longer<00:05:22.539> for<00:05:23.169> me<00:05:23.590> the<00:05:23.770> main<00:05:23.889> problem

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250 
me a lot longer for me the main problem

I have is ice it's not that I can't draw

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.330 
I have is ice it's not that I can't draw
a<00:05:27.400> single<00:05:27.819> eye<00:05:27.970> but<00:05:28.750> it's<00:05:29.050> from<00:05:29.979> the<00:05:30.099> front

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.340 
a single eye but it's from the front

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:31.969 
a single eye but it's from the front
view<00:05:30.490> I<00:05:30.580> normally<00:05:30.940> struggle<00:05:31.240> to<00:05:31.360> get<00:05:31.479> the<00:05:31.599> eyes

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:31.979 
view I normally struggle to get the eyes

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:34.740 
view I normally struggle to get the eyes
almost<00:05:32.979> identical<00:05:33.699> too<00:05:33.910> much<00:05:34.120> you<00:05:34.630> know<00:05:34.720> I

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 
almost identical too much you know I

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.360 
almost identical too much you know I
mean<00:05:34.960> I<00:05:34.990> normally<00:05:35.470> sort<00:05:35.710> of<00:05:35.800> make<00:05:35.949> one<00:05:36.130> a<00:05:36.160> bit

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
mean I normally sort of make one a bit

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.100 
mean I normally sort of make one a bit
bigger<00:05:36.759> one<00:05:37.599> in<00:05:37.720> a<00:05:37.780> slightly<00:05:38.020> different

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.110 
bigger one in a slightly different

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.710 
bigger one in a slightly different
position<00:05:38.550> something<00:05:39.550> like<00:05:39.729> that<00:05:40.000> which

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:40.720 
position something like that which

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.260 
position something like that which
always<00:05:41.139> spoils<00:05:41.440> it<00:05:41.740> well<00:05:42.370> a<00:05:42.400> lot<00:05:42.699> really<00:05:42.970> and

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:43.270 
always spoils it well a lot really and

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:45.719 
always spoils it well a lot really and
but<00:05:44.199> that's<00:05:44.319> sort<00:05:44.710> of<00:05:44.770> why<00:05:44.949> it's<00:05:45.130> important<00:05:45.610> to

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:45.729 
but that's sort of why it's important to

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:48.600 
but that's sort of why it's important to
use<00:05:45.910> construction<00:05:46.389> lines<00:05:46.810> oh<00:05:47.110> why<00:05:47.979> I<00:05:48.009> find<00:05:48.430> it

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610 
use construction lines oh why I find it

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:50.100 
use construction lines oh why I find it
important<00:05:49.060> to<00:05:49.120> use<00:05:49.240> construction<00:05:49.599> lines<00:05:49.900> some

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
important to use construction lines some

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:51.600 
important to use construction lines some
people<00:05:50.380> prefer<00:05:50.530> to<00:05:50.680> work<00:05:50.949> without<00:05:51.310> them<00:05:51.460> so

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610 
people prefer to work without them so

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.550 
people prefer to work without them so
that's<00:05:51.699> fair<00:05:51.970> enough<00:05:52.000> and<00:05:52.419> I<00:05:53.050> will<00:05:53.199> put<00:05:53.440> an
