00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.799
 hello are the head angels lady me 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.820
 I find Mantua here in the Bernina shop 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:17.560
 of wrong 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.480
 today let's see how to use the foot 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.860
 double transport is called double 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.019
 transport because you need it for 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.359
 transport the fabric better, especially 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:27.310
 when you have so many layers put together 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:29.710
 you know that the machine is great 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.720
 to sew it carries the underside 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.600
 if you have multiple layers to help you 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.430
 also carry the upper side 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.460
 reserves this leg is made in this 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.460
 way 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.199
 I'm going to put on my infilo foot 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:08.649
 the hook in the needle clamp screw e 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:12.100
 then insert the pin into the pin e 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:14.350
 I tighten the double bernina foot the 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.750
 transport as I said before you need 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.659
 precisely to carry more layers of 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:23.080
 fabric this foot homogeneously 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:25.690
 it is also given with a series of guides 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.840
 which then you can go to put on 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:31.330
 directly into these holes where it is 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.550
 You can pass this guide by 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.190
 then allow yourself to go straight 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.659
 compared to some stitching maybe done 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.600
 previously 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:43.000
 plus you also have several shoes 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.319
 that can help you make other types 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.759
 of works as some feet do 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:50.649
 normal bernina 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:53.830
 at the moment we are going to see the use 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:56.679
 of double transport for between betting or 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:59.380
 however keep more layers of together 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:02.020
 fabric together I in this case have 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.690
 put a small piece of cloth two beautiful ones 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.379
 stuffing pet and another piece 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:10.090
 of fabric just to let you see that 

00:02:07.379 --> 00:02:12.129
 thanks to this bernina dotto foot 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.770
 transport it is possible to sew e 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:17.140
 carry all at the same time 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.730
 we use these layers 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.610
 very simple straight stitch 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:24.459
 the particularity which is that of 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:27.040
 also carry the upper fabric 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:29.890
 so in this way the fabric does not pull 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.230
 never only on one side and I arrive at 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.390
 end of my seam without having 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.190
 those horrible bending defects that 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:40.300
 usually you have 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:43.209
 this is very suitable for making for 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:46.090
 refine patch work jobs when 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.980
 you go to sew just inside the 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.440
 previously made seam then 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.569
 stitch in the beach and now I'll do it 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.599
 see my project of what i am 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:54.599
 speaking 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.530
 here is how you see me here before 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:08.099
 realized my patch work then when 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:11.310
 I went to bring my whole patch 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:13.439
 work on the padding the quilted 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.120
 following the line I had made in 

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:17.549
 previously the seam made in 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.500
 previously thus keeping separate 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:23.629
 lightly to see the fabric 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:26.819
 well the seam with my needle I go to 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:29.489
 aim right over the seam 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:31.950
 previous in this way the double 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:34.440
 transportation helps me carry the 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:39.599
 fabric above and below evenly and not 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:42.480
 to create those ugly ripples 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:51.569
 that can be obtained at the end of a 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:52.049
 seam like that and also for today it is 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:53.940
 all 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:56.250
 emanuela tonions of rag angels 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.989
 wrong the world of sewing and bernina 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.970
 sewing machines greet you and you 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:01.970
 wait until next leg hello
