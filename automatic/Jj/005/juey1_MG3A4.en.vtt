really<00:01:29.250> need<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.430> focus<00:01:29.579> on<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:30.240> can<00:01:30.360> also<00:01:30.479> use

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
really need to focus on you can also use

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.469 
really need to focus on you can also use
the<00:01:31.460> viewpoints<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.700> make<00:01:32.850> sure<00:01:33.030> that<00:01:33.150> the

character from different angles you

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.330 
character from different angles you
should<00:01:40.710> be<00:01:40.890> able<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.189> see<00:01:41.490> that<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.909> character

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
should be able to see that the character

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.830 
should be able to see that the character
like<00:01:44.340> you<00:01:44.520> shouldn't<00:01:44.759> be<00:01:44.850> able<00:01:44.939> to<00:01:45.060> see<00:01:45.270> the

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
like you shouldn't be able to see the

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.450 
like you shouldn't be able to see the
lower<00:01:46.020> leg<00:01:46.290> behind<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.860> other<00:01:47.009> lower<00:01:47.220> leg<00:01:47.430> and

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
you can see I just fixed that I also

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.940 
you can see I just fixed that I also
previously<00:01:51.119> recorded<00:01:51.600> me<00:01:52.049> making<00:01:52.829> these

to the ground it's a very simple pose I

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.000 
to the ground it's a very simple pose I
have<00:02:20.900> three<00:02:21.900> different<00:02:22.019> versions<00:02:22.470> of<00:02:22.560> it<00:02:22.709> but

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
have three different versions of it but

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.710 
have three different versions of it but
the<00:02:23.220> version<00:02:24.120> that<00:02:24.239> I'm<00:02:24.330> showing<00:02:24.480> you<00:02:24.629> right

a considerable amount of time working on

a considerable amount of time working on
the<00:02:58.380> hands<00:02:58.860> that's<00:02:59.130> not<00:02:59.670> as<00:02:59.880> important<00:03:00.480> but

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
the hands that's not as important but

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.440 
the hands that's not as important but
it's<00:03:00.780> still<00:03:00.930> important<00:03:01.730> as<00:03:02.730> you<00:03:02.880> can<00:03:03.000> see<00:03:03.209> the

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
it's still important as you can see the

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.640 
it's still important as you can see the
arms<00:03:03.930> are<00:03:04.049> parallel<00:03:04.170> to<00:03:04.410> each<00:03:04.560> other<00:03:04.799> and<00:03:06.650> the

arms are parallel to each other and the

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:08.839 
arms are parallel to each other and the
character<00:03:07.980> looks<00:03:08.160> like<00:03:08.220> it's<00:03:08.400> sitting<00:03:08.579> in<00:03:08.760> a

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
character looks like it's sitting in a

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:14.199 
character looks like it's sitting in a
chair<00:03:09.150> with<00:03:09.989> its<00:03:10.140> arms<00:03:10.470> out<00:03:10.650> in<00:03:10.769> front<00:03:10.799> and<00:03:12.799> I

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
chair with its arms out in front and I

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.789 
chair with its arms out in front and I
set<00:03:15.209> the<00:03:15.390> strength<00:03:15.630> of<00:03:15.720> this<00:03:15.780> active<00:03:16.140> pose<00:03:16.349> to

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
set the strength of this active pose to

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:23.990 
set the strength of this active pose to
three<00:03:17.750> test<00:03:18.750> it<00:03:18.870> out<00:03:18.989> I<00:03:22.819> prefer<00:03:23.819> the

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
three test it out I prefer the

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.580 
three test it out I prefer the
character's<00:03:24.569> chest<00:03:25.079> to<00:03:25.170> be<00:03:25.260> a<00:03:25.290> little<00:03:25.500> bit

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
character's chest to be a little bit

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.319 
character's chest to be a little bit
more<00:03:25.739> upright<00:03:26.040> in<00:03:26.609> this<00:03:26.790> position<00:03:29.269> so<00:03:30.269> I

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
more upright in this position so I

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:38.490 
more upright in this position so I
increase<00:03:30.930> the<00:03:31.109> strength<00:03:31.380> to<00:03:31.650> four

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.570 

and<00:03:38.680> that's<00:03:38.830> a<00:03:38.950> little<00:03:39.010> bit<00:03:39.220> more<00:03:39.340> to<00:03:39.490> my

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
and that's a little bit more to my

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.540 
and that's a little bit more to my
liking<00:03:40.090> again<00:03:40.510> I<00:03:40.870> previously<00:03:41.830> captured<00:03:42.130> me

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.550 
liking again I previously captured me

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:44.100 
liking again I previously captured me
making<00:03:42.910> this<00:03:43.000> animation<00:03:43.360> and<00:03:43.750> I'm<00:03:43.870> just

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
making this animation and I'm just

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.830 
making this animation and I'm just
recording<00:03:44.680> my<00:03:44.770> voice<00:03:44.890> over<00:03:45.340> it<00:03:45.490> I<00:03:45.840> thought

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
recording my voice over it I thought

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.740 
recording my voice over it I thought
it'd<00:03:46.930> be<00:03:46.960> a<00:03:47.380> little<00:03:47.980> bit<00:03:48.160> more<00:03:48.460> time-saving<00:03:49.270> to

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
it'd be a little bit more time-saving to

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.480 
it'd be a little bit more time-saving to
do<00:03:49.870> it<00:03:49.960> this<00:03:50.050> way<00:03:50.230> for<00:03:50.800> the<00:03:50.860> viewer<00:03:51.070> and<00:03:53.310> as<00:03:54.310> you

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:54.490 
do it this way for the viewer and as you

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.070 
do it this way for the viewer and as you
can<00:03:54.580> see<00:03:54.640> this<00:03:55.090> is<00:03:55.240> what<00:03:55.390> the<00:03:55.420> sit<00:03:55.660> post<00:03:55.870> looks

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 
can see this is what the sit post looks

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.520 
can see this is what the sit post looks
like<00:03:56.290> the<00:03:56.830> feet<00:03:57.400> are<00:03:58.240> flats<00:03:58.510> the<00:03:58.660> ground<00:03:58.930> the

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
like the feet are flats the ground the

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.250 
like the feet are flats the ground the
lower<00:03:59.860> legs<00:04:00.100> are<00:04:00.190> vertical<00:04:00.720> the<00:04:01.720> thighs<00:04:02.050> are

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
lower legs are vertical the thighs are

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:03.540 
lower legs are vertical the thighs are
horizontal<00:04:02.860> and<00:04:02.980> I<00:04:03.040> think<00:04:03.220> that<00:04:03.310> you<00:04:03.370> need<00:04:03.520> to

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 
horizontal and I think that you need to

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.000 
horizontal and I think that you need to
focus<00:04:03.760> on<00:04:04.030> is<00:04:04.210> that<00:04:04.240> the<00:04:04.660> hips<00:04:04.990> get<00:04:05.230> behind<00:04:05.530> the

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
focus on is that the hips get behind the

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.330 
focus on is that the hips get behind the
feet<00:04:06.280> and<00:04:06.810> now<00:04:07.810> I'm<00:04:07.990> making<00:04:08.110> the<00:04:08.470> arch<00:04:08.830> pose

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
feet and now I'm making the arch pose

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.590 
feet and now I'm making the arch pose
which<00:04:10.060> is<00:04:10.240> just<00:04:10.980> the<00:04:11.980> standard<00:04:12.600> jumping

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
which is just the standard jumping

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.030 
which is just the standard jumping

the active pose over I'm now using it to
make<00:04:31.120> this<00:04:31.480> new<00:04:31.690> pose<00:04:32.340> with<00:04:33.340> the<00:04:33.490> arms<00:04:34.000> I'm

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
make this new pose with the arms I'm

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.280 
make this new pose with the arms I'm
making<00:04:34.420> sure<00:04:34.570> that<00:04:34.720> they're<00:04:34.870> in<00:04:34.960> a<00:04:35.050> straight

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.290 
making sure that they're in a straight

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.410 
making sure that they're in a straight
line<00:04:35.320> to<00:04:35.680> the<00:04:35.800> torso<00:04:36.070> the<00:04:36.520> highest<00:04:37.240> part<00:04:37.390> of

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:37.420 
line to the torso the highest part of

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.620 
line to the torso the highest part of
the<00:04:37.510> torso<00:04:37.660> then<00:04:37.960> I<00:04:38.050> just<00:04:38.200> rotated<00:04:39.390> the<00:04:40.390> parts

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
the torso then I just rotated the parts

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.400 
the torso then I just rotated the parts
of<00:04:40.720> the<00:04:40.780> back<00:04:41.100> backwards<00:04:42.100> and<00:04:43.110> every<00:04:44.110> time<00:04:44.290> I'm

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
of the back backwards and every time I'm

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.260 
of the back backwards and every time I'm
loop<00:04:44.919> move<00:04:45.610> to<00:04:45.760> a<00:04:45.790> different<00:04:45.940> part<00:04:46.180> of<00:04:46.210> the

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
loop move to a different part of the

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.860 
loop move to a different part of the
spine<00:04:46.510> I<00:04:46.919> locked<00:04:47.919> it<00:04:48.300> as<00:04:49.300> you<00:04:49.510> can<00:04:49.600> see<00:04:49.750> the

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
spine I locked it as you can see the

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.890 
spine I locked it as you can see the
spine<00:04:50.110> turned<00:04:50.500> gray<00:04:51.630> again<00:04:52.630> I'm<00:04:52.780> using

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
spine turned gray again I'm using

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.010 
spine turned gray again I'm using
different<00:04:53.860> viewpoints<00:04:54.550> to<00:04:55.090> make<00:04:55.780> sure<00:04:55.900> that

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
different viewpoints to make sure that

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:03.350 
different viewpoints to make sure that
the<00:04:56.140> character's<00:04:56.500> legs<00:04:56.710> are<00:04:57.780> parallel<00:04:58.780> and

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.450 

also<00:05:04.360> my<00:05:04.720> character<00:05:05.110> is<00:05:05.169> really<00:05:05.500> flexible<00:05:05.710> so

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
also my character is really flexible so

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.240 
also my character is really flexible so
I<00:05:06.490> was<00:05:06.760> able<00:05:06.880> to<00:05:07.030> arch<00:05:07.300> its<00:05:07.510> back<00:05:07.690> really<00:05:07.960> far

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
I was able to arch its back really far

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.430 
I was able to arch its back really far
it's<00:05:09.250> going<00:05:09.430> to<00:05:09.490> flip<00:05:09.669> over<00:05:09.790> pretty<00:05:10.060> easily<00:05:10.440> if

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 
it's going to flip over pretty easily if

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.830 
it's going to flip over pretty easily if
your<00:05:11.680> character<00:05:12.130> isn't<00:05:13.090> as<00:05:13.300> flexible<00:05:13.690> it's

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
your character isn't as flexible it's

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.510 
your character isn't as flexible it's
going<00:05:13.990> to<00:05:14.050> be<00:05:14.140> more<00:05:14.770> difficult<00:05:14.980> for<00:05:15.280> you<00:05:15.370> to

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
going to be more difficult for you to

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.940 
going to be more difficult for you to
make<00:05:15.910> tumbling<00:05:16.600> scenes<00:05:16.810> if<00:05:17.470> your<00:05:17.650> character

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:17.950 
make tumbling scenes if your character

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:21.810 
make tumbling scenes if your character
is<00:05:17.980> really<00:05:18.250> flexible<00:05:18.630> you<00:05:19.630> don't<00:05:19.930> need<00:05:20.110> to<00:05:20.820> use

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:21.820 
is really flexible you don't need to use

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.250 
is really flexible you don't need to use
the<00:05:21.970> full<00:05:22.120> extent<00:05:22.360> of<00:05:22.390> its<00:05:22.540> flexibility<00:05:23.080> the

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:23.260 
the full extent of its flexibility the

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:24.990 
the full extent of its flexibility the
arch<00:05:23.440> that<00:05:23.650> I<00:05:23.710> have<00:05:24.010> right<00:05:24.250> now<00:05:24.280> is<00:05:24.790> pretty

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
arch that I have right now is pretty

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.550 
arch that I have right now is pretty
good<00:05:25.270> also<00:05:27.600> the<00:05:28.600> angle<00:05:28.990> that<00:05:29.050> they<00:05:29.200> can't<00:05:29.410> let

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 
good also the angle that they can't let

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.120 
good also the angle that they can't let
the<00:05:29.710> thigh<00:05:29.919> is<00:05:29.980> coming<00:05:30.400> off<00:05:30.550> the<00:05:31.410> hip<00:05:32.410> is

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.130 
the thigh is coming off the hip is

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:36.150 
the thigh is coming off the hip is
pretty<00:05:33.370> good<00:05:33.930> not<00:05:34.930> too<00:05:35.110> severe<00:05:35.500> and<00:05:35.710> I<00:05:35.890> set

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.160 
pretty good not too severe and I set

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.170 
pretty good not too severe and I set
this<00:05:36.370> strength<00:05:37.030> to<00:05:37.360> nine<00:05:37.930> and<00:05:38.669> as<00:05:39.669> you<00:05:39.820> see<00:05:40.000> the

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
this strength to nine and as you see the

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.150 
this strength to nine and as you see the
character<00:05:40.630> flips<00:05:40.870> over<00:05:41.020> to<00:05:41.169> its<00:05:41.500> chest<00:05:41.890> and

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:42.160 
character flips over to its chest and

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:48.420 
character flips over to its chest and
that's<00:05:43.150> really<00:05:43.810> what<00:05:43.930> I<00:05:43.960> want

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:48.430 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:51.420 

and<00:05:49.500> I'm<00:05:50.500> gonna<00:05:50.710> fill<00:05:50.949> with<00:05:50.979> this<00:05:51.220> for<00:05:51.400> a

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.430 
and I'm gonna fill with this for a

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.710 
and I'm gonna fill with this for a
little<00:05:51.610> bit<00:05:51.699> I<00:05:54.150> put<00:05:55.150> a<00:05:55.240> little<00:05:55.360> space<00:05:55.690> in

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:55.720 
little bit I put a little space in

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:56.909 
little bit I put a little space in
between<00:05:55.990> it<00:05:56.259> to<00:05:56.320> see<00:05:56.440> if<00:05:56.530> I<00:05:56.590> can<00:05:56.710> get<00:05:56.830> the

00:05:56.909 --> 00:05:56.919 
between it to see if I can get the

00:05:56.919 --> 00:05:58.290 
between it to see if I can get the
character<00:05:57.250> to<00:05:57.370> travel<00:05:57.669> a<00:05:57.729> little<00:05:57.940> bit<00:05:58.030> more

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.300 
character to travel a little bit more

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.659 
character to travel a little bit more
what's<00:05:58.750> the<00:05:58.870> first<00:05:59.110> back<00:05:59.350> handspring<00:05:59.830> it's

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:00.669 
what's the first back handspring it's

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:01.920 
what's the first back handspring it's
going<00:06:00.910> to<00:06:01.000> be<00:06:01.060> a<00:06:01.090> little<00:06:01.360> bit<00:06:01.479> higher<00:06:01.660> than

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:01.930 
going to be a little bit higher than

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.469 
going to be a little bit higher than
everything<00:06:02.110> else<00:06:03.030> but<00:06:04.030> you<00:06:04.210> want<00:06:04.389> the

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:04.479 
everything else but you want the

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:07.200 
everything else but you want the
character<00:06:04.840> to<00:06:04.870> travel<00:06:05.530> at<00:06:05.740> least<00:06:05.979> one<00:06:06.910> of<00:06:07.030> the

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:07.210 
character to travel at least one of the

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:09.680 
character to travel at least one of the
larger<00:06:07.810> boxes<00:06:08.199> away<00:06:08.440> from<00:06:08.830> its<00:06:08.949> feet<00:06:09.190> and

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:09.690 
larger boxes away from its feet and

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:12.659 
larger boxes away from its feet and
again<00:06:10.690> note<00:06:11.199> that<00:06:11.229> the<00:06:11.500> hips<00:06:11.710> are<00:06:11.860> behind<00:06:12.550> the

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:12.669 
again note that the hips are behind the

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:15.330 
again note that the hips are behind the
feet<00:06:12.880> and<00:06:13.120> the<00:06:14.020> character<00:06:14.380> travels<00:06:14.740> backwards

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:15.340 
feet and the character travels backwards

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:19.409 
feet and the character travels backwards
and<00:06:16.650> it's<00:06:17.650> almost<00:06:18.100> flipped<00:06:18.910> over<00:06:19.060> to<00:06:19.270> its

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:19.419 
and it's almost flipped over to its

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:23.279 
and it's almost flipped over to its
chest<00:06:19.919> when<00:06:21.360> it's<00:06:22.360> hands<00:06:22.600> are<00:06:22.750> contacting<00:06:23.199> the

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:23.289 
chest when it's hands are contacting the

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:25.680 
chest when it's hands are contacting the
ground<00:06:23.580> we<00:06:24.580> want<00:06:24.760> the<00:06:24.940> shoulder<00:06:25.270> we<00:06:25.389> want<00:06:25.539> the

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:25.690 
ground we want the shoulder we want the

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:29.550 
ground we want the shoulder we want the
hands<00:06:25.930> to<00:06:26.229> be<00:06:26.320> in<00:06:26.470> front<00:06:26.770> of<00:06:26.979> the<00:06:28.560> shoulders

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:29.560 
hands to be in front of the shoulders

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:32.540 
hands to be in front of the shoulders
when<00:06:30.280> we<00:06:30.370> get<00:06:30.520> to<00:06:30.610> this<00:06:30.699> position<00:06:31.150> and<00:06:31.389> I

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:32.550 
when we get to this position and I

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:34.469 
when we get to this position and I
lowered<00:06:33.550> the<00:06:33.580> strength<00:06:33.940> there<00:06:34.120> just<00:06:34.389> a<00:06:34.449> little

00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:34.479 
lowered the strength there just a little

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:38.520 
lowered the strength there just a little
bit<00:06:34.750> to<00:06:34.840> see<00:06:34.960> how<00:06:34.990> that<00:06:35.229> was<00:06:36.990> the<00:06:37.990> hands<00:06:38.350> are<00:06:38.500> in

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:38.530 
bit to see how that was the hands are in

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:41.909 
bit to see how that was the hands are in
front<00:06:38.860> of<00:06:39.010> the<00:06:39.130> shoulders<00:06:39.550> and<00:06:40.740> that's<00:06:41.740> what

00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:41.919 
front of the shoulders and that's what

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:45.140 
front of the shoulders and that's what
we<00:06:42.010> need<00:06:42.160> to<00:06:42.310> continue<00:06:42.490> tumbling<00:06:43.740> check<00:06:44.740> out

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:45.150 
we need to continue tumbling check out
