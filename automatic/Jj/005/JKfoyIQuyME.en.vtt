00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
a lot of whole sense and it feels like a

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.459 
a lot of whole sense and it feels like a
lot<00:00:54.090> of<00:00:54.180> filler<00:00:54.390> if<00:00:55.020> you<00:00:55.170> wanna<00:00:55.350> know<00:00:55.440> more

I<00:00:58.680> don't<00:00:59.070> even<00:00:59.129> really<00:00:59.579> remember<00:00:59.730> the<00:01:00.180> story

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
I don't even really remember the story

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.029 
I don't even really remember the story
but<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.629> do<00:01:00.719> remember<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.320> voice<00:01:01.440> acting<00:01:01.980> and

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
but I do remember the voice acting and

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.799 
but I do remember the voice acting and
while<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.399> cast<00:01:02.640> of<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.000> movies<00:01:03.329> does<00:01:03.570> the

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
while the cast of the movies does the

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.230 
while the cast of the movies does the
voice<00:01:03.960> acting<00:01:04.470> I<00:01:04.680> felt<00:01:05.280> like<00:01:05.489> they<00:01:06.030> just

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
voice acting I felt like they just

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.570 
voice acting I felt like they just
didn't<00:01:06.479> give<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:06.659> shit<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:07.220> really<00:01:08.220> it's<00:01:08.340> kind

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
didn't give a shit and really it's kind

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.280 
didn't give a shit and really it's kind
of<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:08.820> guess<00:01:09.090> they<00:01:09.420> played<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.810> game<00:01:09.990> first

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
of I guess they played the game first

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.620 
of I guess they played the game first
done<00:01:10.979> yep<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.369> then<00:01:11.549> did<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.880> voice<00:01:12.030> acting

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
done yep and then did the voice acting

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.260 
done yep and then did the voice acting
and<00:01:12.810> that's<00:01:13.740> why<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:13.979> get<00:01:14.220> that<00:01:14.280> dull<00:01:14.700> sense

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
and that's why you get that dull sense

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.320 
and that's why you get that dull sense
of<00:01:16.009> shit<00:01:17.009> voice<00:01:17.280> acting<00:01:17.729> that<00:01:17.909> you<00:01:18.000> get<00:01:18.180> from

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
of shit voice acting that you get from

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:28.350 
of shit voice acting that you get from
the<00:01:18.450> game<00:01:18.600> on<00:01:18.840> Hellboy<00:01:20.540> that's<00:01:21.540> basically<00:01:21.960> it

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.510 

okay<00:01:29.360> so<00:01:29.420> the<00:01:29.720> graphics<00:01:30.170> of<00:01:30.320> Hellboy<00:01:30.710> the<00:01:31.369> one

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520

thing<00:01:31.700> I<00:01:31.759> did<00:01:31.970> actually<00:01:32.149> liked<00:01:32.420> about<00:01:32.570> this

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
thing I did actually liked about this

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.569 
thing I did actually liked about this
game<00:01:33.049> is<00:01:33.229> that<00:01:33.259> it<00:01:33.500> kind<00:01:33.770> of<00:01:33.890> does<00:01:34.100> stay<00:01:34.310> true

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:34.579 
game is that it kind of does stay true

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:37.060 
game is that it kind of does stay true
to<00:01:34.610> the<00:01:34.939> whole<00:01:35.119> Hellboy<00:01:35.899> design<00:01:36.439> I've<00:01:36.740> read

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
to the whole Hellboy design I've read

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.010 
to the whole Hellboy design I've read
the<00:01:37.189> comics<00:01:37.640> and<00:01:37.820> I<00:01:37.909> enjoyed<00:01:38.210> them<00:01:38.390> so<00:01:38.420> when

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
the comics and I enjoyed them so when

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.300 
the comics and I enjoyed them so when
I'm<00:01:39.110> playing<00:01:39.290> the<00:01:39.439> game<00:01:39.530> a<00:01:39.710> lot<00:01:40.009> of<00:01:40.159> the

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
I'm playing the game a lot of the

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.760 
I'm playing the game a lot of the
monsters<00:01:40.850> will<00:01:41.060> look<00:01:41.780> a<00:01:41.930> lot<00:01:42.079> like<00:01:42.200> the<00:01:42.350> comics

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
monsters will look a lot like the comics

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.399 
monsters will look a lot like the comics
Hellboy<00:01:43.399> looks<00:01:43.670> like<00:01:43.850> Hellboy<00:01:44.420> and<00:01:44.659> even<00:01:45.289> the

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
Hellboy looks like Hellboy and even the

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:46.870 
Hellboy looks like Hellboy and even the
effects<00:01:45.710> are<00:01:45.890> pretty<00:01:46.070> good<00:01:46.250> especially<00:01:46.549> when

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
effects are pretty good especially when

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.429 
effects are pretty good especially when
you're<00:01:47.030> smashing<00:01:47.509> in<00:01:47.600> locks<00:01:47.840> I<00:01:48.049> think<00:01:48.289> that

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439 
you're smashing in locks I think that

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:50.499 
you're smashing in locks I think that
looks<00:01:48.649> pretty<00:01:48.890> cool<00:01:49.070> or<00:01:49.310> ripping<00:01:49.939> at<00:01:50.060> enemy<00:01:50.420> in

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
looks pretty cool or ripping at enemy in

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:53.050 
looks pretty cool or ripping at enemy in
half<00:01:50.720> but<00:01:51.409> um<00:01:51.590> you<00:01:52.189> know<00:01:52.280> the<00:01:52.580> graphics

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
half but um you know the graphics

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.630 
half but um you know the graphics
especially<00:01:53.810> the<00:01:54.289> design<00:01:54.560> the<00:01:54.740> enemy<00:01:55.130> there

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
especially the design the enemy there

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.550 
especially the design the enemy there
are<00:01:55.759> a<00:01:56.060> lot<00:01:56.509> of<00:01:56.539> the<00:01:56.810> enemies<00:01:56.960> you<00:01:57.229> fight<00:01:57.409> it

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
are a lot of the enemies you fight it

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.710 
are a lot of the enemies you fight it
look<00:01:57.740> the<00:01:57.920> same<00:01:57.950> I<00:01:58.490> mean<00:01:59.000> they<00:01:59.119> are<00:01:59.330> the<00:01:59.509> same

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
look the same I mean they are the same

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.570 
look the same I mean they are the same
fight<00:02:00.350> over<00:02:00.380> and<00:02:00.709> over<00:02:00.979> again<00:02:01.039> but<00:02:01.310> we'll<00:02:01.459> get

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
fight over and over again but we'll get

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.219 
fight over and over again but we'll get
more<00:02:01.640> on<00:02:01.940> that<00:02:02.119> it's<00:02:02.360> a<00:02:02.539> game<00:02:02.690> play<00:02:02.959> but

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
more on that it's a game play but

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.800 
more on that it's a game play but
overall<00:02:03.950> the<00:02:04.250> the<00:02:04.610> actual<00:02:05.000> graphical<00:02:05.600> power

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
overall the the actual graphical power

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.919 
overall the the actual graphical power
isn't<00:02:06.140> bad<00:02:06.470> at<00:02:06.649> all<00:02:06.970> yeah<00:02:07.970> I<00:02:08.000> actually<00:02:08.509> say<00:02:08.810> the

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
isn't bad at all yeah I actually say the

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.509 
isn't bad at all yeah I actually say the
graphics<00:02:09.289> are<00:02:09.410> probably<00:02:09.649> the<00:02:09.860> the<00:02:10.190> biggest

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:10.519 
graphics are probably the the biggest

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:11.680 
graphics are probably the the biggest
highlight<00:02:10.850> of<00:02:11.000> the<00:02:11.060> game<00:02:11.090> even<00:02:11.630> though

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
highlight of the game even though

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.050 
highlight of the game even though
they're<00:02:11.810> not<00:02:11.840> superbly<00:02:12.590> greater<00:02:13.010> you<00:02:13.940> know

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
they're not superbly greater you know

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.130

it's<00:03:10.139> kind<00:03:10.319> of<00:03:10.379> cool<00:03:10.590> at<00:03:10.680> first<00:03:10.950> until<00:03:11.609> like

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
it's kind of cool at first until like

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.580

throw<00:03:54.359> them<00:03:54.540> in<00:03:54.629> the<00:03:54.750> air<00:03:54.959> and<00:03:55.109> smash<00:03:55.379> them<00:03:55.620> to

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
throw them in the air and smash them to

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.949 
throw them in the air and smash them to
get<00:03:55.859> health<00:03:56.069> or<00:03:56.340> just<00:03:56.480> repeatedly<00:03:57.480> punch<00:03:57.780> them

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
get health or just repeatedly punch them

00:03:57.959 --> 00:03:59.930 
get health or just repeatedly punch them
in<00:03:57.989> the<00:03:58.109> face<00:03:58.349> and<00:03:58.409> that's<00:03:59.069> all<00:03:59.310> great<00:03:59.549> and<00:03:59.669> all

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
in the face and that's all great and all

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.229 
in the face and that's all great and all
but<00:04:00.209> really<00:04:00.919> it<00:04:01.919> gets<00:04:02.129> boring<00:04:02.370> after<00:04:02.699> the<00:04:02.970> like

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
but really it gets boring after the like

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:04.729 
but really it gets boring after the like
the<00:04:03.359> tenth<00:04:03.629> enemy<00:04:03.989> you<00:04:04.079> pick<00:04:04.260> up<00:04:04.440> and<00:04:04.620> I

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
the tenth enemy you pick up and I

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.949 
the tenth enemy you pick up and I
guarantee<00:04:05.190> you're<00:04:05.430> going<00:04:05.579> to<00:04:05.669> fight<00:04:05.879> over<00:04:05.959> 100

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
guarantee you're going to fight over 100

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.500 
guarantee you're going to fight over 100
enemies<00:04:07.319> in<00:04:07.500> one<00:04:07.650> stage<00:04:07.979> and<00:04:08.340> most<00:04:08.819> likely<00:04:09.090> all

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
enemies in one stage and most likely all

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:10.939 
enemies in one stage and most likely all
the<00:04:09.690> same<00:04:09.870> enemy<00:04:10.199> so<00:04:10.409> the<00:04:10.530> gameplay<00:04:10.919> really

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:10.949 
the same enemy so the gameplay really

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:13.909 
the same enemy so the gameplay really
suffers<00:04:11.729> from<00:04:11.909> being<00:04:12.510> repetitive<00:04:12.959> yeah<00:04:13.709> and

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:13.919 
suffers from being repetitive yeah and

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:15.680 
suffers from being repetitive yeah and
without<00:04:14.069> enough<00:04:14.489> variation<00:04:14.819> to<00:04:15.180> the<00:04:15.329> levels

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
without enough variation to the levels

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:16.789 
without enough variation to the levels
like<00:04:15.870> if<00:04:15.989> they<00:04:16.079> could<00:04:16.139> have<00:04:16.320> mix<00:04:16.470> it<00:04:16.560> up<00:04:16.680> with

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
like if they could have mix it up with

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.500 
like if they could have mix it up with
some<00:04:16.859> more<00:04:17.130> in-depth<00:04:17.489> puzzles<00:04:17.970> and<00:04:18.150> then<00:04:18.329> some

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
some more in-depth puzzles and then some

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.509 
some more in-depth puzzles and then some
maybe<00:04:18.659> platforming<00:04:19.380> and<00:04:19.470> then<00:04:19.560> some<00:04:19.799> fighting

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
maybe platforming and then some fighting

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.460 
maybe platforming and then some fighting
you<00:04:20.609> know<00:04:20.729> the<00:04:21.090> small<00:04:21.720> combo<00:04:22.019> list<00:04:22.289> probably

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
you know the small combo list probably

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:23.899 
you know the small combo list probably
wouldn't<00:04:22.740> be<00:04:22.800> a<00:04:22.830> problem<00:04:23.099> but<00:04:23.250> as<00:04:23.460> it<00:04:23.639> stands

00:04:23.899 --> 00:04:23.909 
wouldn't be a problem but as it stands

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:33.740 
wouldn't be a problem but as it stands
it's<00:04:24.210> just<00:04:24.449> way<00:04:24.870> way<00:04:25.199> too<00:04:25.620> damn<00:04:25.949> repetitive

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.720 

overall<00:04:34.750> I<00:04:34.780> think<00:04:35.110> I<00:04:35.560> would<00:04:35.860> have<00:04:35.980> enjoyed<00:04:36.160> how

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:36.730 
overall I think I would have enjoyed how

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:38.850 
overall I think I would have enjoyed how
blame<00:04:37.060> or<00:04:37.270> if<00:04:37.510> I<00:04:37.750> didn't<00:04:38.080> run<00:04:38.200> into<00:04:38.380> one<00:04:38.650> of<00:04:38.680> the

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
blame or if I didn't run into one of the

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.350 
blame or if I didn't run into one of the
biggest<00:04:39.040> glitches<00:04:39.580> I've<00:04:39.730> ever<00:04:39.940> seen<00:04:40.180> in<00:04:40.330> my

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
biggest glitches I've ever seen in my

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.780 
biggest glitches I've ever seen in my
life<00:04:40.470> basically<00:04:41.470> I<00:04:41.830> got<00:04:42.040> to<00:04:42.220> the<00:04:42.310> second<00:04:42.670> level

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:42.790 
life basically I got to the second level

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.690 
life basically I got to the second level
I<00:04:43.120> get<00:04:43.390> up<00:04:43.510> to<00:04:43.660> this<00:04:43.780> boss<00:04:44.050> and<00:04:44.490> the<00:04:45.490> whole

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:45.700 
I get up to this boss and the whole

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.220 
I get up to this boss and the whole
point<00:04:45.880> of<00:04:46.090> this<00:04:46.210> part<00:04:46.600> is<00:04:46.780> you're<00:04:46.960> supposed<00:04:47.050> to

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:47.230 
point of this part is you're supposed to

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:48.810 
point of this part is you're supposed to
break<00:04:47.500> the<00:04:47.650> pillar<00:04:47.860> so<00:04:48.160> it<00:04:48.400> keeps<00:04:48.550> collapsing

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
break the pillar so it keeps collapsing

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.150 
break the pillar so it keeps collapsing
so<00:04:49.420> the<00:04:49.840> the<00:04:50.230> tower<00:04:50.440> you're<00:04:50.680> in<00:04:50.830> keeps

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 
so the the tower you're in keeps

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.680 
so the the tower you're in keeps
collapsing<00:04:51.340> eventually<00:04:52.120> killing<00:04:52.330> the<00:04:52.510> boss

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:52.690 
collapsing eventually killing the boss

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.110 
collapsing eventually killing the boss
but<00:04:53.380> instead<00:04:53.710> this<00:04:53.980> boss<00:04:54.280> likes<00:04:54.580> to<00:04:54.730> be<00:04:54.850> funny

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
but instead this boss likes to be funny

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.940 
but instead this boss likes to be funny
and<00:04:55.420> gets<00:04:55.720> stuck<00:04:55.960> behind<00:04:56.170> a<00:04:56.440> pillar<00:04:56.650> and

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.950 
and gets stuck behind a pillar and

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:57.990 
and gets stuck behind a pillar and
that's<00:04:57.610> it

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
that's it

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.400 
that's it
you<00:04:58.150> can't<00:04:58.360> get<00:04:58.540> close<00:04:58.780> to<00:04:58.930> the<00:04:59.020> boss<00:04:59.230> you

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
you can't get close to the boss you

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:00.840 
you can't get close to the boss you
can't<00:04:59.650> break<00:04:59.830> down<00:04:59.860> the<00:05:00.190> pillar<00:05:00.400> you<00:05:00.490> can't

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850 
can't break down the pillar you can't

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.090 
can't break down the pillar you can't
finish<00:05:01.060> the<00:05:01.360> boss<00:05:01.540> and<00:05:01.810> you're<00:05:02.650> basically

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:03.100 
finish the boss and you're basically

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.220 
finish the boss and you're basically
stuck<00:05:03.370> there<00:05:03.880> I<00:05:04.150> reset<00:05:04.690> the<00:05:04.810> game<00:05:04.930> two<00:05:05.110> or

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:05.230 
stuck there I reset the game two or

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:07.350 
stuck there I reset the game two or
three<00:05:05.410> times<00:05:05.590> and<00:05:06.010> same<00:05:06.490> result<00:05:06.850> I<00:05:07.000> don't<00:05:07.120> know

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
three times and same result I don't know

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.180 
three times and same result I don't know
if<00:05:07.480> this<00:05:07.690> is<00:05:07.720> my<00:05:07.990> game<00:05:08.290> it<00:05:08.740> probably<00:05:09.040> is

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190 
if this is my game it probably is

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.610 
if this is my game it probably is
because<00:05:09.430> I<00:05:09.520> know<00:05:09.580> people<00:05:09.700> that<00:05:10.060> beat<00:05:10.270> it<00:05:10.450> but<00:05:11.230> I

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
because I know people that beat it but I

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.680 
because I know people that beat it but I
just<00:05:12.160> I<00:05:12.400> can't<00:05:12.820> forgive<00:05:13.090> that<00:05:13.150> and<00:05:13.540> that's

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
just I can't forgive that and that's

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:16.080 
just I can't forgive that and that's
another<00:05:13.960> point<00:05:14.290> down<00:05:14.500> for<00:05:14.740> this<00:05:14.890> game<00:05:15.090> the

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
another point down for this game the

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:17.850 
another point down for this game the
rest<00:05:16.330> of<00:05:16.480> the<00:05:16.540> game<00:05:16.720> I<00:05:16.930> wasn't<00:05:17.440> having<00:05:17.560> much

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:17.860 
rest of the game I wasn't having much

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.470 
rest of the game I wasn't having much
fun<00:05:17.890> basically<00:05:18.250> because<00:05:18.730> the<00:05:18.850> atmosphere

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:19.480 
fun basically because the atmosphere

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.450 
fun basically because the atmosphere
isn't<00:05:19.900> doing<00:05:20.350> anything<00:05:20.740> for<00:05:20.980> me<00:05:21.040> really

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:21.460 
isn't doing anything for me really

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.030 
isn't doing anything for me really
enemies<00:05:21.970> as<00:05:22.420> I<00:05:22.450> said<00:05:22.780> all<00:05:22.900> the<00:05:23.140> same<00:05:23.410> you're

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:24.040 
enemies as I said all the same you're

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.700 
enemies as I said all the same you're
just<00:05:24.190> really<00:05:24.460> not<00:05:24.640> having<00:05:25.560> there's<00:05:26.560> just

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
just really not having there's just

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:27.930 
just really not having there's just
nothing<00:05:27.010> special<00:05:27.250> about<00:05:27.490> this<00:05:27.640> game<00:05:27.820> it

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:27.940 
nothing special about this game it

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:29.910 
nothing special about this game it
doesn't<00:05:28.090> really<00:05:28.240> try<00:05:28.510> to<00:05:28.540> do<00:05:28.750> anything<00:05:29.110> I<00:05:29.530> mean

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:29.920 
doesn't really try to do anything I mean

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.800 
doesn't really try to do anything I mean
even<00:05:30.340> if<00:05:30.460> it<00:05:30.580> took<00:05:30.730> notes<00:05:30.970> from<00:05:31.180> devil<00:05:31.480> may<00:05:31.600> cry

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.810 
even if it took notes from devil may cry

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:34.740 
even if it took notes from devil may cry
or<00:05:32.200> Onimusha<00:05:32.680> with<00:05:33.010> the<00:05:33.130> bosses<00:05:33.670> it<00:05:34.180> just<00:05:34.570> it

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 
or Onimusha with the bosses it just it

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.900 
or Onimusha with the bosses it just it
would<00:05:34.900> have<00:05:35.020> been<00:05:35.140> better<00:05:35.320> but<00:05:35.590> as<00:05:35.890> it<00:05:36.610> stands

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:36.910 
would have been better but as it stands

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:40.200 
would have been better but as it stands
it's<00:05:37.240> like<00:05:38.080> the<00:05:38.350> most<00:05:38.500> average<00:05:39.040> I<00:05:39.370> say<00:05:40.090> it's

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.210 
it's like the most average I say it's

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:42.780 
it's like the most average I say it's
even<00:05:40.330> below<00:05:40.750> average<00:05:40.990> game<00:05:41.470> I've<00:05:41.650> ever<00:05:41.790> liked

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:42.790 
even below average game I've ever liked

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:44.940 
even below average game I've ever liked
this<00:05:42.940> would<00:05:43.090> be<00:05:43.180> the<00:05:43.300> definition<00:05:43.750> of<00:05:43.960> a<00:05:44.500> game

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:44.950 
this would be the definition of a game

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:47.070 
this would be the definition of a game
that<00:05:45.160> really<00:05:45.460> needed<00:05:45.670> a<00:05:45.850> lot<00:05:46.030> more<00:05:46.060> work<00:05:46.450> well

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.080 
that really needed a lot more work well

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.900 
that really needed a lot more work well
yeah<00:05:47.470> and<00:05:47.710> you're<00:05:48.010> right<00:05:48.190> it<00:05:48.310> doesn't<00:05:48.850> a<00:05:48.880> lot

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:48.910 
yeah and you're right it doesn't a lot

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:50.370 
yeah and you're right it doesn't a lot
more<00:05:49.210> work<00:05:49.360> from<00:05:49.540> you<00:05:49.930> know<00:05:50.050> it<00:05:50.170> could<00:05:50.290> have

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:50.380 
more work from you know it could have

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:51.690 
more work from you know it could have
had<00:05:50.470> more<00:05:50.710> combos<00:05:51.130> could<00:05:51.340> I<00:05:51.370> had<00:05:51.520> more

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:51.700 
had more combos could I had more

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.480 
had more combos could I had more
variation<00:05:52.330> could<00:05:53.170> have<00:05:53.320> had<00:05:53.470> just<00:05:53.800> it<00:05:54.340> could

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:54.490 
variation could have had just it could

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:56.970 
variation could have had just it could
have<00:05:54.610> even<00:05:54.670> been<00:05:54.790> longer<00:05:55.180> it's<00:05:55.900> just<00:05:56.260> it's

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:56.980 
have even been longer it's just it's

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:59.340 
have even been longer it's just it's
just<00:05:57.100> something<00:05:57.550> that<00:05:57.580> had<00:05:57.790> potential<00:05:58.210> and<00:05:58.720> it

00:05:59.340 --> 00:05:59.350 
just something that had potential and it

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:00.900 
just something that had potential and it
just<00:05:59.590> was<00:05:59.770> completely<00:05:59.950> thrown<00:06:00.370> out<00:06:00.760> the

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:00.910 
just was completely thrown out the

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:01.290 
just was completely thrown out the
window

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:01.300 
window

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.900

now even with all that said I've played
the<00:06:04.060> game<00:06:04.090> twice<00:06:04.600> the<00:06:05.290> first<00:06:05.470> time<00:06:05.680> I

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:05.710 
the game twice the first time I

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:08.340 
the game twice the first time I
absolutely<00:06:06.100> hated<00:06:06.700> it<00:06:06.970> the<00:06:07.420> second<00:06:07.840> time<00:06:08.020> I

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:08.350 
absolutely hated it the second time I

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:10.020 
absolutely hated it the second time I
actually<00:06:08.770> knowing<00:06:09.070> some<00:06:09.340> of<00:06:09.370> its<00:06:09.550> faults<00:06:09.850> I

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:10.030 
actually knowing some of its faults I

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:11.160 
actually knowing some of its faults I
was<00:06:10.180> actually<00:06:10.270> able<00:06:10.450> to<00:06:10.600> accept<00:06:10.810> a<00:06:10.930> little

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:11.170 
was actually able to accept a little

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:12.390 
was actually able to accept a little
more<00:06:11.260> and<00:06:11.350> actually<00:06:11.560> have<00:06:11.650> more<00:06:11.830> fun<00:06:12.100> with<00:06:12.130> it
