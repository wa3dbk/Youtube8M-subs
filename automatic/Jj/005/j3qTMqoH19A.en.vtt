00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
video is really the tomatillo which is

video is really the tomatillo which is
you<00:00:25.590> know<00:00:25.680> a<00:00:25.710> staple<00:00:26.460> in<00:00:26.550> Mexican<00:00:27.090> cuisine<00:00:27.210> and

you know a staple in Mexican cuisine and

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.599 
you know a staple in Mexican cuisine and
really<00:00:28.230> an<00:00:28.289> interesting<00:00:28.710> vegetable<00:00:29.130> I've<00:00:29.490> had

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
really an interesting vegetable I've had

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.220 
really an interesting vegetable I've had
some<00:00:29.760> people<00:00:29.880> come<00:00:30.000> by<00:00:30.300> here<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.810> summer<00:00:31.050> and

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
some people come by here the summer and

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.940 
some people come by here the summer and
ask<00:00:31.410> me<00:00:31.740> what<00:00:31.920> this<00:00:32.099> plant<00:00:32.369> was<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:33.829> many<00:00:34.829> of

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
ask me what this plant was and many of

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.200 
ask me what this plant was and many of
these<00:00:35.040> folks<00:00:35.250> didn't<00:00:35.550> even<00:00:35.640> know<00:00:35.880> what<00:00:36.090> this

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
these folks didn't even know what this

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.119 
these folks didn't even know what this
was<00:00:36.510> but<00:00:37.110> if<00:00:37.410> you've<00:00:37.620> heard<00:00:37.829> of<00:00:37.920> something

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
was but if you've heard of something

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.180 
was but if you've heard of something
like<00:00:38.340> salsa<00:00:38.850> verde<00:00:39.239> green<00:00:39.600> salsa<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.530> lot<00:00:41.040> of

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
like salsa verde green salsa a lot of

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.940 
like salsa verde green salsa a lot of
times<00:00:41.430> Mexican<00:00:42.420> cooking<00:00:42.780> Mexican<00:00:43.590> cuisine

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
times Mexican cooking Mexican cuisine

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.250 
times Mexican cooking Mexican cuisine
will<00:00:44.160> use<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.670> tomatillo<00:00:45.149> in<00:00:45.390> it<00:00:45.539> so<00:00:45.989> this<00:00:46.200> is

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
will use the tomatillo in it so this is

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.720 
will use the tomatillo in it so this is
the<00:00:46.379> tomatillo<00:00:46.890> plant<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.430> why<00:00:47.520> do<00:00:47.579> I<00:00:47.700> say

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
the tomatillo plant and why do I say

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.310 
the tomatillo plant and why do I say
this<00:00:47.969> is<00:00:48.120> sort<00:00:48.239> of<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.450> video<00:00:48.570> about<00:00:48.840> two<00:00:49.050> things

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
this is sort of a video about two things

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.779 
this is sort of a video about two things
so<00:00:49.469> we'll<00:00:49.620> talk<00:00:49.800> about<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.190> tomatillo<00:00:50.700> and

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
so we'll talk about the tomatillo and

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.790 
so we'll talk about the tomatillo and
how<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.059> grow<00:00:51.360> it<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.690> why<00:00:52.050> it's<00:00:52.230> so<00:00:52.350> wonderful

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
how to grow it and why it's so wonderful

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.610 
how to grow it and why it's so wonderful
but<00:00:53.219> also<00:00:53.399> notice<00:00:53.910> this<00:00:54.750> is<00:00:54.930> in<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.110> container

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
but also notice this is in a container

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.220 
but also notice this is in a container
so<00:00:55.949> we're<00:00:56.489> growing<00:00:56.760> this<00:00:57.090> wonderful<00:00:57.719> plant<00:00:58.020> in

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
so we're growing this wonderful plant in

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.069 
so we're growing this wonderful plant in
a<00:00:58.320> container<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:59.160> we'll<00:01:00.090> get<00:01:00.270> all<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.750> fruit

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
a container and we'll get all the fruit

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.770 
a container and we'll get all the fruit
on<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:01.829> is<00:01:01.890> just<00:01:02.070> laden<00:01:03.059> with<00:01:03.510> small

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
on it it is just laden with small

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.899 
on it it is just laden with small
tomatillos<00:01:04.409> they're<00:01:04.799> probably<00:01:05.129> not<00:01:05.519> going<00:01:05.760> to

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
tomatillos they're probably not going to

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.969 
tomatillos they're probably not going to
get<00:01:06.030> as<00:01:06.210> big<00:01:06.600> as<00:01:06.930> you<00:01:07.439> would<00:01:07.560> get<00:01:07.710> if<00:01:07.830> they<00:01:07.950> were

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
get as big as you would get if they were

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.410 
get as big as you would get if they were
in<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.220> regular<00:01:08.549> garden<00:01:08.820> but<00:01:08.939> there's<00:01:09.119> so

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
in the regular garden but there's so

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.630 
in the regular garden but there's so
many<00:01:09.659> of<00:01:09.990> them<00:01:10.020> so<00:01:10.710> let's<00:01:10.920> talk<00:01:11.100> first<00:01:11.400> about

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
many of them so let's talk first about

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.240 
many of them so let's talk first about
how<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:11.970> grow<00:01:12.240> this<00:01:12.479> number<00:01:13.049> one<00:01:13.260> tomatillos

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
how to grow this number one tomatillos

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.219 
how to grow this number one tomatillos
are<00:01:14.430> notorious<00:01:15.000> for<00:01:15.240> not<00:01:15.270> being<00:01:15.869> self

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
are notorious for not being self

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.840 
are notorious for not being self
pollinating<00:01:16.890> in<00:01:17.040> other<00:01:17.220> words<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.610> need<00:01:17.790> to

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
pollinating in other words you need to

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.899 
pollinating in other words you need to
so<00:01:18.780> my<00:01:18.960> other<00:01:19.250> tomatillos<00:01:20.250> are<00:01:20.280> just<00:01:20.670> around

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
so my other tomatillos are just around

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.390 
so my other tomatillos are just around
the<00:01:21.060> corner<00:01:21.119> I<00:01:21.780> have<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.619> whole<00:01:22.890> bunch<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.250> them

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
the corner I have a whole bunch of them

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.460 
the corner I have a whole bunch of them
actually<00:01:23.670> in<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.180> garden<00:01:24.540> so<00:01:24.900> this<00:01:25.020> is<00:01:25.200> close

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
actually in the garden so this is close

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.590 
actually in the garden so this is close
enough<00:01:25.680> that<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.070> pollination<00:01:26.640> obviously<00:01:27.509> is

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
enough that the pollination obviously is

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.910 
enough that the pollination obviously is
occurring<00:01:28.080> they've<00:01:28.409> actually<00:01:28.560> done<00:01:28.860> studies

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
occurring they've actually done studies

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.399 
occurring they've actually done studies
on<00:01:29.640> this<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.060> discovered<00:01:30.780> that<00:01:30.869> if<00:01:30.990> you<00:01:31.020> plant

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
on this and discovered that if you plant

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.770 
on this and discovered that if you plant
one<00:01:31.770> alone<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:32.759> it<00:01:32.880> doesn't<00:01:33.270> have<00:01:33.360> any<00:01:33.509> others

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
one alone and it doesn't have any others

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.080 
one alone and it doesn't have any others
near<00:01:33.990> it<00:01:34.079> it<00:01:34.200> rarely<00:01:34.799> will<00:01:35.220> set<00:01:35.520> very<00:01:35.850> much

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
near it it rarely will set very much

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.020 
near it it rarely will set very much
fruit<00:01:36.420> so<00:01:36.659> if<00:01:37.049> you<00:01:37.229> only<00:01:37.530> plant<00:01:37.979> one<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.610> you

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
fruit so if you only plant one and you

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.480 
fruit so if you only plant one and you
don't<00:01:39.360> get<00:01:39.540> any<00:01:39.750> fruit<00:01:40.110> that's<00:01:40.470> probably<00:01:41.189> one

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
don't get any fruit that's probably one

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.520 
don't get any fruit that's probably one
of<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.670> reasons

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.600 

there<00:01:45.530> are<00:01:45.680> different<00:01:46.100> varieties<00:01:46.520> of

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
there are different varieties of

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.880 
there are different varieties of
tomatillos<00:01:47.300> so<00:01:47.479> they<00:01:47.630> can<00:01:47.780> be<00:01:47.900> green<00:01:48.229> yellow

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
tomatillos so they can be green yellow

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.730 
tomatillos so they can be green yellow
red<00:01:49.250> even<00:01:49.729> purple<00:01:50.360> this<00:01:50.690> particular<00:01:51.290> one<00:01:51.530> as

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
red even purple this particular one as

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
red even purple this particular one as
it<00:01:52.220> ripens<00:01:52.760> is<00:01:52.970> mostly<00:01:53.660> of<00:01:53.840> the<00:01:53.870> green<00:01:54.380> variety

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:57.760 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.400 

the<00:01:58.760> nice<00:01:59.000> thing<00:01:59.270> about<00:01:59.300> tomatillos<00:02:00.050> for<00:02:00.320> the

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.410 
the nice thing about tomatillos for the

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.530 
the nice thing about tomatillos for the
beginning<00:02:00.800> gardener<00:02:01.430> is<00:02:01.610> that<00:02:01.880> they<00:02:02.030> rarely

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
beginning gardener is that they rarely

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.930 
beginning gardener is that they rarely
suffer<00:02:02.840> too<00:02:03.200> many<00:02:03.380> diseases<00:02:03.830> you<00:02:04.520> don't<00:02:04.759> want

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
suffer too many diseases you don't want

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.100 
suffer too many diseases you don't want
to<00:02:05.000> have<00:02:05.090> it<00:02:05.210> too<00:02:05.330> close<00:02:05.570> to<00:02:05.750> the<00:02:05.869> ground

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
to have it too close to the ground

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.029 
to have it too close to the ground
because<00:02:06.440> slugs<00:02:07.070> you<00:02:07.310> like<00:02:07.640> to<00:02:07.790> eat<00:02:07.940> the<00:02:08.090> leaves

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
because slugs you like to eat the leaves

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.290 
because slugs you like to eat the leaves
they<00:02:10.039> can<00:02:10.190> also<00:02:10.340> get<00:02:10.610> some<00:02:10.670> of<00:02:10.880> the<00:02:11.030> blights

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
they can also get some of the blights

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.940 
they can also get some of the blights
that<00:02:11.510> affect<00:02:11.810> Tomatoes<00:02:12.230> by<00:02:12.410> the<00:02:12.470> way<00:02:12.650> this<00:02:12.830> is

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
that affect Tomatoes by the way this is

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.130 
that affect Tomatoes by the way this is
a<00:02:12.980> cousin<00:02:13.490> of<00:02:13.580> tomatoes<00:02:14.000> it's<00:02:14.209> not<00:02:14.600> a<00:02:14.630> tomato

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
a cousin of tomatoes it's not a tomato

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.400 
a cousin of tomatoes it's not a tomato
plant<00:02:15.350> it's<00:02:15.620> a<00:02:15.709> different<00:02:16.160> plant<00:02:17.410> you'll

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
plant it's a different plant you'll

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:19.990 
plant it's a different plant you'll
definitely<00:02:18.830> want<00:02:19.040> to<00:02:19.100> give<00:02:19.280> this<00:02:19.459> even

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
definitely want to give this even

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.380 
definitely want to give this even
watering<00:02:21.130> notice<00:02:22.130> the<00:02:22.280> plant<00:02:22.520> grows<00:02:22.820> wider

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
watering notice the plant grows wider

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.199 
watering notice the plant grows wider
than<00:02:23.989> it<00:02:24.140> does<00:02:24.350> tall<00:02:24.800> so<00:02:25.190> unlike<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:25.820> tomato

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
than it does tall so unlike the tomato

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.810 
than it does tall so unlike the tomato
which<00:02:26.720> gets<00:02:26.959> very<00:02:27.230> tall<00:02:27.590> and<00:02:27.620> very<00:02:27.830> heavy<00:02:28.280> this

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
which gets very tall and very heavy this

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.720 
which gets very tall and very heavy this
plant<00:02:29.120> doesn't<00:02:29.330> need<00:02:29.570> quite<00:02:29.930> as<00:02:30.110> much<00:02:30.290> support

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
plant doesn't need quite as much support

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.100 
plant doesn't need quite as much support
you'll<00:02:31.730> definitely<00:02:32.209> want<00:02:32.390> to<00:02:32.450> choose<00:02:32.630> a<00:02:32.690> large

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
you'll definitely want to choose a large

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.510 
you'll definitely want to choose a large
enough<00:02:33.410> container<00:02:33.830> we<00:02:34.010> have<00:02:34.100> a<00:02:34.130> container

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
enough container we have a container

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.030 
enough container we have a container
here<00:02:34.850> which<00:02:34.970> is<00:02:35.120> 15<00:02:35.630> inches<00:02:35.989> across<00:02:36.260> I<00:02:36.650> would

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
here which is 15 inches across I would

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.520 
here which is 15 inches across I would
say<00:02:37.220> that<00:02:37.400> anything<00:02:37.640> 15<00:02:38.360> inches<00:02:38.720> or<00:02:38.930> larger

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
say that anything 15 inches or larger

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.140 
say that anything 15 inches or larger
it's<00:02:39.739> probably<00:02:40.280> a<00:02:40.310> good<00:02:40.580> idea

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
it's probably a good idea

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.970 
it's probably a good idea
I've<00:02:41.209> grown<00:02:41.660> things<00:02:42.050> like<00:02:42.260> cucumbers<00:02:42.830> and

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
I've grown things like cucumbers and

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.979 
I've grown things like cucumbers and
smaller<00:02:43.340> containers<00:02:43.970> but<00:02:44.300> this<00:02:44.480> plant<00:02:44.780> gets

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
smaller containers but this plant gets

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:48.100 
smaller containers but this plant gets
fairly<00:02:45.320> wide<00:02:45.769> and<00:02:46.130> also<00:02:46.910> it's<00:02:47.090> using<00:02:47.540> so<00:02:47.930> much

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
fairly wide and also it's using so much

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.410 
fairly wide and also it's using so much
water<00:02:48.170> that<00:02:49.130> if<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:49.370> container<00:02:49.760> is<00:02:49.850> too<00:02:50.120> small

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
water that if the container is too small

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.699 
water that if the container is too small
you're<00:02:50.600> going<00:02:50.630> to<00:02:50.780> have<00:02:50.900> to<00:02:51.049> water<00:02:51.260> it<00:02:51.410> every

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
you're going to have to water it every

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.080 
you're going to have to water it every
few<00:02:51.980> hours<00:02:52.040> instead<00:02:53.000> of<00:02:53.060> just<00:02:53.360> once<00:02:53.570> a<00:02:53.690> day<00:02:55.090> how

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
few hours instead of just once a day how

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.340 
few hours instead of just once a day how
do<00:02:56.150> you<00:02:56.269> know<00:02:56.360> when<00:02:56.480> these<00:02:56.600> bad<00:02:56.780> boys<00:02:56.959> are<00:02:57.170> ripe

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
do you know when these bad boys are ripe

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.160 
do you know when these bad boys are ripe
well<00:02:57.680> the<00:02:58.160> outer<00:02:58.400> husk<00:02:58.940> which<00:02:59.299> is<00:02:59.450> not<00:02:59.720> edible

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
well the outer husk which is not edible

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.800 
well the outer husk which is not edible
will<00:03:00.680> actually<00:03:01.220> begin<00:03:01.519> to<00:03:01.549> turn<00:03:01.910> yellow<00:03:02.450> and

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
will actually begin to turn yellow and

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.810 
will actually begin to turn yellow and
eventually<00:03:03.320> brown<00:03:03.620> that's<00:03:04.280> when<00:03:04.700> the

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
eventually brown that's when the

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:10.390 
eventually brown that's when the
tomatillo<00:03:05.269> is<00:03:05.510> right

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.199 

so<00:03:10.909> if<00:03:11.000> you<00:03:11.120> open<00:03:11.360> up<00:03:11.659> the<00:03:11.870> calyx<00:03:12.790> you<00:03:13.790> will<00:03:13.940> see

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
so if you open up the calyx you will see

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:19.730 
so if you open up the calyx you will see
inside<00:03:15.099> there<00:03:16.099> is<00:03:16.400> the<00:03:16.430> fruit

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:19.740 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.580 

so<00:03:20.250> that<00:03:20.550> is<00:03:20.790> the<00:03:20.940> edible<00:03:21.210> part<00:03:21.540> now<00:03:21.690> as<00:03:22.260> I<00:03:22.380> said

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
so that is the edible part now as I said

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.170 
so that is the edible part now as I said
these<00:03:22.770> are<00:03:22.950> a<00:03:22.980> little<00:03:23.190> bit<00:03:23.370> smaller<00:03:23.790> than<00:03:23.940> I

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
these are a little bit smaller than I

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.820 
these are a little bit smaller than I
would<00:03:24.360> like<00:03:24.390> but<00:03:24.810> one<00:03:25.260> of<00:03:25.350> the<00:03:25.410> reasons<00:03:25.770> for

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
would like but one of the reasons for

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.020 
would like but one of the reasons for
that<00:03:26.160> is<00:03:26.370> they<00:03:26.550> are<00:03:26.580> container<00:03:27.120> grown<00:03:29.030> quick

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
that is they are container grown quick

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.520 
that is they are container grown quick
story<00:03:30.300> I<00:03:30.360> was<00:03:30.510> in<00:03:30.600> Peru<00:03:30.750> several<00:03:31.200> years<00:03:31.410> ago

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
story I was in Peru several years ago

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.830 
story I was in Peru several years ago
and<00:03:31.860> they<00:03:32.250> actually<00:03:32.430> took<00:03:32.910> the<00:03:33.090> calyx<00:03:33.600> and

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
and they actually took the calyx and

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.910 
and they actually took the calyx and
they<00:03:35.060> twisted<00:03:36.060> it<00:03:36.240> and<00:03:36.480> they<00:03:37.320> dipped<00:03:37.710> the

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
they twisted it and they dipped the

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.850 
they twisted it and they dipped the
tomatillo<00:03:38.550> in<00:03:39.090> a<00:03:39.240> caramel<00:03:39.900> and<00:03:40.110> serve<00:03:40.440> that<00:03:40.470> as

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
tomatillo in a caramel and serve that as

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.860 
tomatillo in a caramel and serve that as
a<00:03:40.890> dessert<00:03:41.400> it's<00:03:41.820> like<00:03:41.910> a<00:03:41.940> little<00:03:42.240> candied

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
a dessert it's like a little candied

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.780 
a dessert it's like a little candied
tomatillo<00:03:43.410> except<00:03:44.040> instead<00:03:44.310> of<00:03:44.400> using<00:03:44.580> an

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
tomatillo except instead of using an

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
tomatillo except instead of using an
apple<00:03:45.240> they<00:03:45.570> use<00:03:45.720> this

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.630 

so<00:03:49.440> the<00:03:49.980> taste<00:03:50.310> I<00:03:51.110> find<00:03:52.110> the<00:03:52.230> taste<00:03:52.490> to<00:03:53.490> be<00:03:53.520> a

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
so the taste I find the taste to be a

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.830 
so the taste I find the taste to be a
little<00:03:54.030> bit<00:03:54.150> like<00:03:54.300> a<00:03:54.330> tomato<00:03:55.040> but<00:03:56.040> it<00:03:56.190> also<00:03:56.430> has

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
little bit like a tomato but it also has
