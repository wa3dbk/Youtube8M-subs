00:01:30.431 --> 00:01:31.431

All you're did, rolling on the floor, this is not meaning of fly. You're just rolling on the floor.

00:01:44.007 --> 00:01:45.609
Bioenergy is a bullshit.

- For God's sake!
- Bioenerji in everywhere already. Like your watch.

00:01:47.972 --> 00:01:53.848
But your watch can't heal your hand.

00:02:38.844 --> 00:02:40.393

Look, Mr. Selim. I chance my operator
to Vodafone. Why is that?

00:03:14.776 --> 00:03:19.102
Because Vodafone says ''Fold and Earn campaing. 
What is that mean?''

00:03:19.103 --> 00:03:23.190
 When you install 10 TL, you earn 50 TL. 
When you install second 10 TL, you earn 100 TL.

00:03:23.191 --> 00:03:31.896
In third install, 150 TL, in fourth install you earn
200 TL. And with all of that you can earn to 500 TL.

00:03:31.897 --> 00:03:36.762
And this money you earn, you can 
spent on your recipe. To all operators.
