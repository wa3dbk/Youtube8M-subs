00:00:53.130 --> 00:01:28.950 

you

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:41.400 

so<00:01:29.960> that's

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.410 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.460 

and<00:01:42.670> this<00:01:43.670> here<00:01:43.940> is<00:01:43.970> this<00:01:44.360> this<00:01:44.780> cord<00:01:45.080> here<00:01:45.110> is

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
and this here is this this cord here is

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.910 
and this here is this this cord here is
G<00:01:46.370> and<00:01:46.550> since<00:01:46.730> we're<00:01:46.850> in<00:01:46.880> drop<00:01:47.210> D<00:01:47.470> this<00:01:48.470> the

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
G and since we're in drop D this the

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.469 
G and since we're in drop D this the
normal<00:01:49.280> of<00:01:49.370> the<00:01:49.460> G<00:01:49.640> note<00:01:49.790> would<00:01:49.970> be<00:01:50.120> here

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
normal of the G note would be here

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:53.950 
normal of the G note would be here
obviously<00:01:51.670> but<00:01:52.670> it's<00:01:52.850> moved<00:01:53.150> up<00:01:53.450> two<00:01:53.660> spaces

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
obviously but it's moved up two spaces

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.640 
obviously but it's moved up two spaces
because<00:01:54.470> it's<00:01:54.650> dropped<00:01:54.920> down<00:01:55.070> a<00:01:55.369> whole<00:01:55.610> step

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
because it's dropped down a whole step

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.650 
because it's dropped down a whole step
so<00:01:57.650> that<00:01:58.580> that's<00:01:58.910> what's<00:01:59.119> happening<00:01:59.479> there

00:01:59.650 --> 00:01:59.660 
so that that's what's happening there

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:05.730 
so that that's what's happening there
and<00:01:59.869> when<00:02:00.080> you<00:02:00.170> go<00:02:00.350> when<00:02:01.010> I<00:02:01.070> when<00:02:01.520> he's<00:02:01.640> going
