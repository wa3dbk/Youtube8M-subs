just pretty much land on it and you just

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.600 
just pretty much land on it and you just
kind<00:00:36.600> of<00:00:36.630> want<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.840> keep<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.649> side<00:00:37.920> next<00:00:38.489> to

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
kind of want to keep to the side next to

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.580 
kind of want to keep to the side next to
the<00:00:38.760> wall<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.270> if<00:00:39.870> you<00:00:39.989> do<00:00:40.079> that<00:00:40.260> you<00:00:40.410> won't

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
the wall and if you do that you won't

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.280 
the wall and if you do that you won't
fall<00:00:40.800> through<00:00:40.829> or<00:00:41.100> anything<00:00:41.430> like<00:00:41.460> that<00:00:41.610> and

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.290 
fall through or anything like that and

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.869 
fall through or anything like that and
you<00:00:43.290> actually<00:00:43.469> can<00:00:43.829> go<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.010> little<00:00:44.219> bit<00:00:44.399> off<00:00:44.579> of

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
you actually can go a little bit off of

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.010 
you actually can go a little bit off of
the<00:00:45.379> the<00:00:46.379> wooden<00:00:46.739> board<00:00:47.550> because<00:00:47.850> I<00:00:48.059> well<00:00:48.719> show

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
the the wooden board because I well show

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.420 
the the wooden board because I well show
that<00:00:49.230> later<00:00:49.469> in<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.680> video<00:00:49.770> I<00:00:49.950> think<00:00:50.190> it's<00:00:50.280> one

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
that later in the video I think it's one

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.860 
that later in the video I think it's one
of<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.550> what<00:00:50.700> last<00:00:51.180> clips<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.690> I'll<00:00:51.750> also

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
of the what last clips and I'll also

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.330 
of the what last clips and I'll also
show<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.170> third<00:00:52.410> person<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:52.949> what<00:00:53.070> it<00:00:53.160> looks

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
show a third person of what it looks

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.819 
show a third person of what it looks
like<00:00:53.840> there's<00:00:54.840> not<00:00:54.989> really<00:00:55.170> much<00:00:55.379> you<00:00:55.559> can<00:00:55.710> do

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
like there's not really much you can do

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.290 
like there's not really much you can do
down<00:00:55.980> here<00:00:56.010> it's<00:00:56.520> just<00:00:56.760> kind<00:00:56.940> of<00:00:57.000> one<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.210> those

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
down here it's just kind of one of those

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.880 
down here it's just kind of one of those
spots<00:00:57.539> that's<00:00:57.780> pretty<00:00:57.989> cool<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.379> be<00:00:58.410> in<00:00:58.649> and

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
spots that's pretty cool to be in and

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.740 
spots that's pretty cool to be in and
it's<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.219> pretty<00:00:59.399> good<00:00:59.579> hiding<00:00:59.940> spot<00:01:00.149> overall

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
it's a pretty good hiding spot overall

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.740 
it's a pretty good hiding spot overall
