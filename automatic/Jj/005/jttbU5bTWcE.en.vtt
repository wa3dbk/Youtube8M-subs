00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:07.490
 Hi, I'm going to talk about the public hearing 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:10.360
 is beginning those who do not know or do not know 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:13.330
 have heard of disc 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:16.860
 that is getting this time for 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:20.890
 start I must say it's a technique 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:25.869
 very old and I do not speak to you 50 years ago 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:29.040
 years 100 years but even more is the 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:33.430
 Indian it seems to me that it is as we say 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:36.370
 they kept their oral health first I 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.620
 he called attention because he said that one 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.360
 of the benefits is the bleached 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.550
 dental 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:46.850
 I said this 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:49.219
 interesting is interesting because it's going 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.410
 doing in a very progressive way and 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:54.170
 it's not like when you're going to make yourself 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.899
 bleached to the dental office and sales 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.960
 with this optical white smile that is 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:01.250
 it seems that you flesh for a light you're 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.629
 Theirs good at first you 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.030
 put a light for now so that you 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:08.390
 you bring one and you're afraid that maybe 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:12.049
 in a den or places with neon light 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:14.060
 your teeth also shine like it did in 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:16.970
 french I remember that chapter of peoples 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.979
 in short, what he does and then he goes 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.490
 doing in a progressive way like 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:24.110
 one of the benefits and apart also 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.780
 Detoxify what good that does already your 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.670
 body 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:31.420
 but in my name we call attention because 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:35.020
 As you well know, the mouth is one of the 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:37.020
 the dirtiest places the being has 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.049
 human 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:44.850
 so then think about all the 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:48.390
 bacteria toxins that live in your mouth 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:53.340
 and I in the use mode be 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:55.440
 preferably an organic oil per 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.270
 those who cook us serve us not what 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.070
 go to try the kitchen do not 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.909
 it's going to be useless 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:06.960
 this I used the coconut because I saw that it was 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:09.160
 one that is used quite apart was very 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:13.100
 easy to find 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:17.010
 with this spoon he took the least 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:20.159
 two tablespoons of this size 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:23.010
 I put it in my mouth in the morning 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:27.330
 first time you have to rinse without taking 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:30.300
 water as well as wake up you put the 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:34.380
 do this oil rinse 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:36.240
 and keeps it in the mouth between 15 and 20 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:40.710
 minutes is very important when 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:44.460
 they are going to release what they are going to throw 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:46.110
 do in the sink because at the end of 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.870
 beads is an oil and it's going to go 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.420
 drying as it goes down the 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.950
 drainage and if there is a possibility that 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:57.709
 they are 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:03:01.050
 tape then the best thing is to use the 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:04.530
 disputed to do it in the pot of 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.959
 trash like that already 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:11.370
 they can ascend and there's no problem 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:12.990
 you plug some pipe like 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.600
 mouthwash 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:17.100
 I also have it all over my mouth and 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.280
 then a toothbrush like 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.860
 any way but remember very very 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.500
 important also to brush 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.120
 simple because this will help them 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.130
 dry to remove a little oil that 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:33.060
 it can be accepted that at first it was 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:34.830
 very difficult to say that the first 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.600
 feeling you have is that you get 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.030
 some solid things and then it goes 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.360
 melting in the sensation of the sedyt 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.360
 they 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.160
 and of course you can not swallow it 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.000
 professions of swallowing all toxins 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.640
 mentioned 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.770
 the tablespoons of oil start what 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.870
 maximum that can reach sometimes will be 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:58.470
 the nine minutes and soraya ejecting 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:01.380
 a lot and always remembering to get off 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:03.390
 really do rinse because if you do not 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.100
 move you know how not officiate hold 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:09.300
 more but it's no use having him there 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:11.550
 sustained but that the joke of all 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:17.150
 this is moving it by your teeth 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:19.680
 simple language and everything he remembers 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:23.790
 there's a lot I started doing all the 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:27.390
 days but then I got some pains 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:31.080
 of head and looking for a little more pain 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:32.910
 of head could be one of the effects 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.919
 secondary because by doing certain 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.840
 pressures that in the jaw is of 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:39.090
 where I felt my headache was coming 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.919
 so I was here if all this 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.110
 I finished until then I decided better 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:45.720
 do it a maximum of three times to the 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.950
 week always leaving a day of 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.740
 medium 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:51.930
 I already have more of the month doing this 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:56.600
 practice if they are whiter because I 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.600
 I took the picture of before and after 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.120
 He hopes to show you the photos but 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:05.360
 evidence what I am telling you is 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:07.940
 true if it bleached my teeth improved 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.880
 also something else that maybe should 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:14.310
 give them shame to say but I tell them to improve 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:16.110
 my morning breath 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.570
 it's another thing it's one thing that you give 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:21.390
 account immediately very important that 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:25.960
 when you go to do the rinse with 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:30.009
 the oil must have been of 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:31.630
 fasting of 34 hours or so by 

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:33.160
 that is, I recommend that you 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.969
 do in the morning and I do it three 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:38.059
 times a week 

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:40.039
 and I say it for my problem of the 

00:05:38.059 --> 00:05:42.569
 headaches but if you have 

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:44.999
 a problem of that 

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:46.710
 and forward can all 

00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:48.659
 days I say it is much more than better 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:50.279
 I do not see any problem when I 

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:52.949
 did every day apart from the pain of 

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:56.159
 head did not see other problems I do not know if 

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:58.589
 it's me or I've seen that this world is 

00:05:56.159 --> 00:06:03.029
 with coconut oil at this time 

00:05:58.589 --> 00:06:06.270
 good another taste if you already have a gallon a 

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:10.469
 coconut oil tank for hair 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:14.249
 skin whatever else it also serves 

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:17.669
 for the mouth and not for making you chicken 

00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:19.319
 pudding you're going to avoid going to the dentist from 

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:21.199
 some cleaning when you have some 

00:06:19.319 --> 00:06:24.209
 problem do you have some discipline 

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:27.270
 it takes time the time is doing 

00:06:24.209 --> 00:06:29.639
 for a long time 15 minutes at 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:32.099
 better for some people during the 

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:34.789
 mornings can mean a lot but 

00:06:32.099 --> 00:06:37.709
 while they are doing well you could be 

00:06:34.789 --> 00:06:40.369
 making the bed changing you bathe 

00:06:37.709 --> 00:06:42.539
 I think that if it's what you can 

00:06:40.369 --> 00:06:44.169
 find the time to do while 

00:06:42.539 --> 00:06:47.259
 do something else 

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:49.210
 if they will succeed or they know it they tell me that 

00:06:47.259 --> 00:06:53.680
 such your thoughts thoughts comments 

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:55.200
 suggestions whatever we are we are in another 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:59.470
 video and 

00:06:55.200 --> 00:07:03.870
 but the before and after pictures 

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:03.870
 we should not get another video bay
