00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
hopefully a simple way to take the

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.070 
hopefully a simple way to take the
airbags<00:00:06.089> off<00:00:06.299> of<00:00:06.450> these<00:00:06.540> cars

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
airbags off of these cars

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.080 
airbags off of these cars
this<00:00:07.500> is<00:00:07.620> front<00:00:07.859> steering<00:00:08.130> wheels<00:00:08.370> from<00:00:08.610> a<00:00:08.700> 98

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
this is front steering wheels from a 98

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.780 
this is front steering wheels from a 98
Passat<00:00:09.480> no<00:00:10.290> multifunction<00:00:11.280> controls<00:00:11.639> or

Passat no multifunction controls or
anything<00:00:11.969> like<00:00:12.240> that<00:00:12.269> just<00:00:12.630> a<00:00:12.809> basic<00:00:13.259> steering

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
anything like that just a basic steering

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.870 
anything like that just a basic steering
wheel<00:00:13.769> with<00:00:13.889> the<00:00:13.980> airbag<00:00:16.730> essentially<00:00:17.730> what

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
wheel with the airbag essentially what

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.120 
wheel with the airbag essentially what
you're<00:00:18.060> trying<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.390> do<00:00:18.630> is<00:00:18.869> there's<00:00:19.830> these

you're trying to do is there's these
little<00:00:20.400> spikes<00:00:20.730> on<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.840> airbag<00:00:22.680> they're<00:00:23.010> kind

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
little spikes on the airbag they're kind

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.220 
little spikes on the airbag they're kind
of<00:00:23.310> retaining<00:00:23.880> spikes<00:00:24.240> see<00:00:24.570> if<00:00:24.660> I<00:00:24.810> can<00:00:24.930> get<00:00:25.050> you

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
of retaining spikes see if I can get you

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.830 
of retaining spikes see if I can get you
a<00:00:25.260> decent<00:00:26.160> shot<00:00:26.310> of<00:00:26.490> it<00:00:26.580> there<00:00:26.760> right<00:00:27.029> so<00:00:27.720> what

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
a decent shot of it there right so what

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:28.849 
a decent shot of it there right so what
you're<00:00:27.960> trying<00:00:28.050> to<00:00:28.199> do<00:00:28.289> is<00:00:28.439> just<00:00:28.470> kind<00:00:28.800> of

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
you're trying to do is just kind of

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.030 
you're trying to do is just kind of
clear<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.099> spring<00:00:29.460> off<00:00:29.789> of<00:00:29.970> that<00:00:30.060> spike<00:00:31.040> it

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
clear a spring off of that spike it

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.889 
clear a spring off of that spike it
doesn't<00:00:32.610> take<00:00:32.700> a<00:00:32.730> lot<00:00:32.880> of<00:00:32.940> leverage<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.270> do<00:00:33.570> but

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
doesn't take a lot of leverage to do but

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.240 
doesn't take a lot of leverage to do but
down<00:00:34.079> in<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.410> middle<00:00:34.800> of<00:00:34.950> this<00:00:35.390> guess<00:00:36.390> horn

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
down in the middle of this guess horn

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.799 
down in the middle of this guess horn
retention<00:00:38.250> spring<00:00:38.910> or<00:00:39.090> something<00:00:39.660> whatever

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
retention spring or something whatever

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.420 
retention spring or something whatever
it's<00:00:40.079> called<00:00:40.170> it's<00:00:40.440> got<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.620> name<00:00:40.800> I'm<00:00:40.980> sure<00:00:41.010> and

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
it's called it's got a name I'm sure and

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.880 
it's called it's got a name I'm sure and
the<00:00:41.520> Germans<00:00:41.850> do<00:00:42.000> that<00:00:42.469> there's<00:00:43.469> this<00:00:43.649> little

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
the Germans do that there's this little

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.250 
the Germans do that there's this little
bar<00:00:44.190> that's<00:00:44.940> spring-loaded<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:45.960> you're<00:00:46.110> just

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
bar that's spring-loaded and you're just

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.160 
bar that's spring-loaded and you're just
trying<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.620> slide<00:00:47.280> it<00:00:47.489> out<00:00:47.610> of<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.820> way<00:00:48.170> so

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
trying to slide it out of the way so

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.439 
trying to slide it out of the way so
that<00:00:49.200> it'll<00:00:49.559> clear<00:00:49.890> those<00:00:50.039> spikes<00:00:53.000> so<00:00:54.000> let's

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
that it'll clear those spikes so let's

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.450 
that it'll clear those spikes so let's
give<00:00:54.660> you<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.840> quick<00:00:55.170> demonstration<00:00:55.469> through

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
give you a quick demonstration through

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.779 
give you a quick demonstration through
the<00:00:56.579> airbag<00:00:56.879> on<00:00:57.090> there<00:00:57.329> clipped<00:00:58.109> in<00:00:58.260> place<00:00:58.789> and

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
the airbag on there clipped in place and

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.420 
the airbag on there clipped in place and
there's<00:01:00.270> two<00:01:00.629> guides<00:01:00.960> in<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.980> back<00:01:02.190> of<00:01:02.340> these

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
there's two guides in the back of these

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.039 
there's two guides in the back of these
things<00:01:02.730> there's<00:01:03.149> one<00:01:03.359> that<00:01:03.510> goes<00:01:03.660> this<00:01:03.840> way

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
things there's one that goes this way

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.750 
things there's one that goes this way
and<00:01:04.080> then<00:01:04.439> one<00:01:04.619> that<00:01:04.769> goes<00:01:04.920> this<00:01:05.100> way<00:01:05.309> follow

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
and then one that goes this way follow

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.870 
and then one that goes this way follow
this<00:01:06.210> one<00:01:06.530> so<00:01:07.530> imagine<00:01:08.040> this<00:01:08.159> sorry<00:01:08.670> it's<00:01:08.820> not

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
this one so imagine this sorry it's not

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.730 
this one so imagine this sorry it's not
on<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.119> car<00:01:09.270> obviously<00:01:09.750> but<00:01:10.200> this<00:01:10.290> is<00:01:10.470> where

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
on the car obviously but this is where

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.080 
on the car obviously but this is where
the<00:01:10.830> steering<00:01:11.130> column<00:01:11.250> would<00:01:11.490> be<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:11.790> if<00:01:11.909> this

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
the steering column would be and if this

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.910 
the steering column would be and if this
was<00:01:12.330> facing<00:01:12.869> up<00:01:12.990> like<00:01:13.380> they<00:01:13.560> tell<00:01:13.710> you<00:01:13.830> to

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
was facing up like they tell you to

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.160 
was facing up like they tell you to
rotate<00:01:14.100> it<00:01:14.400> 90<00:01:14.670> degrees<00:01:14.760> so<00:01:15.150> this<00:01:15.509> is<00:01:15.720> upwards

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
rotate it 90 degrees so this is upwards

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.230 
rotate it 90 degrees so this is upwards
you<00:01:16.650> want<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:16.950> put<00:01:17.189> it<00:01:17.280> so<00:01:17.430> this<00:01:17.580> handle<00:01:18.000> is

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
you want to put it so this handle is

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.270 
you want to put it so this handle is
facing<00:01:18.869> your<00:01:18.960> steering<00:01:19.290> column<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:20.100> want<00:01:20.189> to

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
facing your steering column you want to

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.830 
facing your steering column you want to
make<00:01:20.430> sure<00:01:20.640> that<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:20.970> keep<00:01:21.210> putting<00:01:21.540> it<00:01:21.720> in

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
make sure that you keep putting it in

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.149 
make sure that you keep putting it in
that<00:01:22.020> way<00:01:22.200> you'll<00:01:22.380> feel<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:22.770> just<00:01:22.799> kind<00:01:23.100> of

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
that way you'll feel it just kind of

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.859 
that way you'll feel it just kind of
jiggle<00:01:23.400> it<00:01:23.490> around<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.970> I'll<00:01:24.060> get<00:01:24.270> in<00:01:24.479> between

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
jiggle it around and I'll get in between

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.810 
jiggle it around and I'll get in between
those<00:01:25.049> two<00:01:25.290> channels<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:26.220> when<00:01:26.490> you<00:01:26.580> get<00:01:26.700> it

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
those two channels and when you get it

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.819 
those two channels and when you get it
all<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.060> way<00:01:27.150> in<00:01:27.390> all<00:01:28.049> you're<00:01:28.229> going<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.380> do<00:01:28.590> is

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
all the way in all you're going to do is

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.370 
all the way in all you're going to do is
just<00:01:29.070> take<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.430> handle<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:29.939> then<00:01:30.180> lift<00:01:30.509> up<00:01:31.140> on

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
just take the handle and then lift up on

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.539 
just take the handle and then lift up on
it<00:01:32.360> of<00:01:33.360> course<00:01:33.630> I<00:01:33.780> did<00:01:33.930> this<00:01:34.130> there<00:01:35.130> we<00:01:35.250> go

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
it of course I did this there we go

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.149 
it of course I did this there we go
you'll<00:01:36.329> see<00:01:36.659> you'll<00:01:36.750> feel<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.110> kind<00:01:37.259> of<00:01:37.380> spring

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
you'll see you'll feel it kind of spring

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.950 
you'll see you'll feel it kind of spring
free<00:01:38.400> there<00:01:38.579> this<00:01:38.970> spring<00:01:39.210> will<00:01:39.360> help<00:01:39.720> push<00:01:39.930> it

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
free there this spring will help push it

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.420 
free there this spring will help push it
out<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.500> we'll<00:01:40.590> try<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.770> do<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.009> on<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.310> other

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
out and we'll try to do it on the other

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.260 
out and we'll try to do it on the other
side<00:01:41.549> too<00:01:41.909> here<00:01:43.250> again<00:01:44.250> imagine<00:01:44.670> this<00:01:45.030> is

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
side too here again imagine this is

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.120 
side too here again imagine this is
facing<00:01:45.570> upward<00:01:46.200> on<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.350> car<00:01:46.680> so<00:01:47.009> you're

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
facing upward on the car so you're

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.560 
facing upward on the car so you're
putting<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.399> handle<00:01:47.759> towards<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.180> steering

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
putting the handle towards the steering

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.590 
putting the handle towards the steering
column<00:01:48.750> slide<00:01:49.740> it<00:01:49.920> in<00:01:50.040> there<00:01:51.409> let's<00:01:52.409> see

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
column slide it in there let's see

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.830 
column slide it in there let's see
there<00:01:54.290> we<00:01:54.409> go<00:01:54.740> of<00:01:55.520> course<00:01:55.759> that's<00:01:56.000> really<00:01:56.479> safe

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
there we go of course that's really safe

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.960 
there we go of course that's really safe
with<00:01:57.110> the<00:01:57.290> live<00:01:57.500> air<00:01:57.680> bag<00:01:57.890> too<00:01:58.159> sorry<00:01:58.880> about

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
with the live air bag too sorry about

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.840 
with the live air bag too sorry about
that<00:01:59.060> but<00:01:59.990> that's<00:02:00.259> the<00:02:00.860> that's<00:02:01.189> the<00:02:01.430> gist<00:02:01.700> of

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
that but that's the that's the gist of

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.230 
that but that's the that's the gist of
it<00:02:01.970> I<00:02:02.150> found<00:02:02.900> that<00:02:03.700> this<00:02:04.700> size<00:02:04.940> screwdriver

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
it I found that this size screwdriver

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.529 
it I found that this size screwdriver
works<00:02:05.720> best<00:02:06.280> anything<00:02:07.280> longer<00:02:07.759> than<00:02:08.060> this<00:02:08.239> and

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
works best anything longer than this and

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.280 
works best anything longer than this and
I<00:02:09.259> ended<00:02:09.590> up<00:02:10.270> damaging<00:02:11.270> my<00:02:11.420> gauge<00:02:11.600> cluster<00:02:12.020> if

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
I ended up damaging my gauge cluster if

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.010 
I ended up damaging my gauge cluster if
the<00:02:12.560> handle<00:02:12.860> got<00:02:13.040> gets<00:02:13.630> caught<00:02:14.630> up<00:02:14.750> on<00:02:14.870> the

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
the handle got gets caught up on the

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.630 
the handle got gets caught up on the
glass<00:02:15.230> and<00:02:15.440> you<00:02:15.470> can't<00:02:15.709> get<00:02:15.830> the<00:02:15.980> proper<00:02:16.310> angle

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
glass and you can't get the proper angle

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.880 
glass and you can't get the proper angle
you<00:02:16.790> need<00:02:16.910> back<00:02:17.120> here<00:02:17.360> you<00:02:18.110> can<00:02:18.290> see<00:02:18.530> when<00:02:18.770> you

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
you need back here you can see when you

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.490 
you need back here you can see when you
put<00:02:19.100> it<00:02:19.190> in<00:02:19.340> if<00:02:20.030> it's<00:02:20.720> all<00:02:20.870> the<00:02:21.020> way<00:02:21.110> in<00:02:21.290> there

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
put it in if it's all the way in there

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.010 
put it in if it's all the way in there
still<00:02:21.800> clearance<00:02:22.250> in<00:02:22.459> there<00:02:22.640> right<00:02:23.540> they're

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
still clearance in there right they're

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.570 
still clearance in there right they're
still<00:02:24.350> in<00:02:24.470> what<00:02:24.680> half<00:02:24.980> an<00:02:25.130> inch<00:02:25.280> of<00:02:25.430> clearance

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
still in what half an inch of clearance

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.190 
still in what half an inch of clearance
so<00:02:25.819> that's<00:02:25.970> all<00:02:26.120> you<00:02:26.269> really<00:02:26.450> need<00:02:26.750> anything

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
so that's all you really need anything

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.080 
so that's all you really need anything
longer<00:02:27.440> and<00:02:27.830> again<00:02:28.069> your<00:02:28.370> gauge<00:02:28.580> cluster<00:02:29.000> will

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
longer and again your gauge cluster will

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.970 
longer and again your gauge cluster will
get<00:02:29.209> in<00:02:29.300> the<00:02:29.390> way<00:02:29.540> and<00:02:29.750> you<00:02:30.110> can't<00:02:30.440> you<00:02:30.800> won't

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
get in the way and you can't you won't

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.729 
get in the way and you can't you won't
be<00:02:31.100> able<00:02:31.190> to<00:02:31.280> get<00:02:31.400> it<00:02:31.519> in<00:02:31.610> there<00:02:31.760> right<00:02:32.739> you

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
be able to get it in there right you

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:35.890 
be able to get it in there right you
probably<00:02:34.220> won't<00:02:34.489> be<00:02:34.670> able<00:02:34.790> to<00:02:34.910> see<00:02:35.330> it<00:02:35.420> on<00:02:35.630> here

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
probably won't be able to see it on here

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.729 
probably won't be able to see it on here
but<00:02:36.170> uh<00:02:36.319> maybe<00:02:37.690> probably<00:02:38.690> not<00:02:38.840> but<00:02:39.470> that

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
but uh maybe probably not but that

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.590 
but uh maybe probably not but that
little<00:02:39.890> bar<00:02:40.220> doesn't<00:02:40.700> take<00:02:40.880> a<00:02:40.910> lot<00:02:41.150> to<00:02:41.360> slide

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
little bar doesn't take a lot to slide

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.270 
little bar doesn't take a lot to slide
it<00:02:41.750> out<00:02:41.810> of<00:02:41.930> the<00:02:42.019> way<00:02:42.140> and<00:02:42.410> once<00:02:42.560> you<00:02:42.709> do<00:02:42.950> slide

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
it out of the way and once you do slide

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.860 
it out of the way and once you do slide
it<00:02:43.400> out<00:02:43.459> of<00:02:43.519> the<00:02:43.640> way<00:02:43.790> again<00:02:44.180> the<00:02:44.360> spring<00:02:44.600> here

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
it out of the way again the spring here

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.949 
it out of the way again the spring here
is<00:02:44.959> going<00:02:45.200> to<00:02:45.260> help<00:02:45.380> pop<00:02:45.590> it<00:02:45.769> up<00:02:45.890> I<00:02:46.600> know<00:02:47.600> it<00:02:47.810> can

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
is going to help pop it up I know it can

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.770 
is going to help pop it up I know it can
be<00:02:47.989> a<00:02:48.110> pain<00:02:48.470> when<00:02:48.769> it's<00:02:48.920> on<00:02:49.069> the<00:02:49.100> car<00:02:49.780> but

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
be a pain when it's on the car but

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.009 
be a pain when it's on the car but
hopefully<00:02:51.230> this<00:02:51.410> helps<00:02:51.680> out<00:02:51.830> a<00:02:51.860> little<00:02:52.069> bit

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
hopefully this helps out a little bit

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.110 
hopefully this helps out a little bit
yeah<00:02:54.049> so<00:02:54.410> that's<00:02:54.650> it<00:02:54.830> again<00:02:55.160> tiny<00:02:55.940> little

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
yeah so that's it again tiny little

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.720 
yeah so that's it again tiny little
screw<00:02:56.390> driver<00:02:56.660> and<00:02:57.290> there's<00:02:57.950> guides<00:02:58.340> in<00:02:58.549> here

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
screw driver and there's guides in here

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.430 
screw driver and there's guides in here
this<00:02:58.880> is<00:02:58.940> where<00:02:59.120> your<00:02:59.239> con<00:02:59.390> Center<00:02:59.810> column

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
this is where your con Center column

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.530 
this is where your con Center column
would<00:03:00.530> be<00:03:00.709> and<00:03:00.920> that<00:03:00.950> would<00:03:01.340> be<00:03:01.489> facing<00:03:01.760> up<00:03:02.120> 90

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
would be and that would be facing up 90

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.080 
would be and that would be facing up 90
degrees<00:03:02.630> to<00:03:03.200> expose<00:03:03.860> those<00:03:04.070> holes<00:03:04.340> and<00:03:04.880> again

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
degrees to expose those holes and again

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.819 
degrees to expose those holes and again
it<00:03:05.299> just<00:03:05.329> goes<00:03:05.600> in<00:03:05.840> at<00:03:05.959> a<00:03:05.989> slight<00:03:06.200> angle<00:03:06.500> like

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:06.829 
it just goes in at a slight angle like

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:08.979 
it just goes in at a slight angle like
that<00:03:06.910> gets<00:03:07.910> you<00:03:08.030> an<00:03:08.090> idea<00:03:08.390> and<00:03:08.630> that's<00:03:08.780> about

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
that gets you an idea and that's about

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.080 
that gets you an idea and that's about
as<00:03:09.200> far<00:03:09.230> in<00:03:09.590> it's<00:03:10.310> about<00:03:10.400> as<00:03:10.579> far<00:03:10.609> in<00:03:10.940> as<00:03:11.060> it's

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
as far in it's about as far in as it's

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.440 
as far in it's about as far in as it's
going<00:03:11.359> to<00:03:11.420> go<00:03:11.600> right<00:03:11.989> there<00:03:12.200> alright<00:03:13.450> that's

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450

lift up on it and then I'll move that

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.210 
lift up on it and then I'll move that
spring<00:03:17.660> out<00:03:17.750> of<00:03:17.870> the<00:03:17.930> way<00:03:18.019> alright<00:03:18.739> hope<00:03:19.040> this
