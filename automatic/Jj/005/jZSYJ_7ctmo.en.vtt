00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:07.319
 hi my name is javier ponce and in this 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:10.650
 video let's see how to use a sheet 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.780
 excel to solve the calculation of a 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.960
 expansion tank for a system of 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.450
 Water 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.610
 with this simple excel sheet we will apply 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:22.119
 the boyle mariot law described in the 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:26.650
 Chapter 9 of the standard une 100 cent 55 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:28.980
 and tech way you give this sheet to 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.289
 perform these simple calculations 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.470
 we must enter some data that are 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.660
 the squares that are in yellow like 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.570
 are the volume of the thermos temperature 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.940
 maximum accumulator maximum pressure of 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:46.150
 the pressure network installation and pressure 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.220
 minimum that the accumulator will suffer 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:51.700
 we will obtain the results in the 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:55.510
 red boxes 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:57.580
 For example let's enter the volume of 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.890
 an accumulator expressed in liters 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.690
 we have a 500 liter battery 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.570
 whenever there is a little corner of color 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:07.360
 red we will see an example comment 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.790
 here says intro volume in liters 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.700
 accumulated in the water accumulator 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.600
 hot if we have an accumulator of 500 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.259
 liters 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.640
 at a maximum temperature of 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:21.890
 preparation of hot water 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.830
 accumulator or for example conditions 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:28.950
 normal let's say they are 65 degrees 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.470
 Maximum pressure of the installation pressure 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.660
 Triggering of the safety valve is 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.700
 an accumulator for example may have 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.580
 a trigger pressure of the valve 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.090
 Safety around 5 bar we select 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:44.880
 5 bar and minimum network pressure , let's say 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.710
 that the minimum pressure to which it is 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.290
 subjected the accumulator the pressure of the 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.910
 cold water be 2.2 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.400
 and those conditions we have a 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:57.300
 coefficient of expansion of 1 76 per 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.950
 one hundred coefficient dilation is 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.780
 exponentially proportional to the 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.020
 maximum accumulator temperature 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:08.820
 we have a dilated volume of 881 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.060
 liters and with a performance of the glass of 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.150
 2.62 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.880
 we need an expansion vessel of 23 to 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.500
 1 liters up there for example 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.660
 a 25 liter expansion vessel 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.440
 if we increase the temperature of the 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:27.050
 accumulator will logically increase the 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.300
 vessel capacity select 70 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.160
 degrees will increase the coefficient of 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.020
 dilation that is not linear is 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.390
 exponential with the temperature of the 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.780
 Accumulator now are 2 as to 0 3% 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.270
 we need 26 liters 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.760
 The greater the difference between the 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:45.670
 minimum and maximum pressures less 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.069
 volume of accumulated less volume 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.450
 you will need the expansion vessel for 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:52.270
 example an installation that pressure 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:56.060
 minimum network is a bar the volume of the 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:58.340
 glass are 16 9 liters 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.080
 if we go back to the previous situation and what 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.890
 what we do is bring the pressures 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:06.349
 maximum and minimum we have a valve 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.989
 of safety maximum pressure of the 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:14.090
 installation of 4 bar the glass 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:14.930
 expansion goes from 26 to 6 liters to 38 9 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.370
 liters 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.140
 the more it differentiates the more 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.569
 There is a travel inside the glass 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:23.690
 expansion in the pneumatic chamber as 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:25.880
 less volume we need the more 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:29.239
 the expansion vessel is nearby 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:31.130
 lose more space we said in the part 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:33.530
 pneumatic performance is higher and for 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:36.420
 both the capacity that the glass needs 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:39.060
 of expansion because it increases 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.580
 Well with this simple sheet we can 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.560
 solve the calculations of the volumes 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.480
 Expansion vessel expansion 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.209
 in hot water circuits 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.580
 sanitary this table only serves to 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:52.980
 water between 30 and 120 degrees and it's not 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:55.020
 valid the calculation for the glass of 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:58.920
 expansion in solar energy that has 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:01.080
 other criteria described in h 4 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:04.340
 thank you very much for your attention and 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.340
 until the next video
