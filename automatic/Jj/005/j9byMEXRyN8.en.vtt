00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
relief Chapman and you know they kind of

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.749 
relief Chapman and you know they kind of
want<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.799> see<00:01:49.920> what<00:01:50.040> he<00:01:50.130> can<00:01:50.250> do<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.399> little<00:01:50.610> bit

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
want to see what he can do a little bit

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:51.950 
want to see what he can do a little bit
both<00:01:50.909> spots<00:01:51.180> but<00:01:51.299> I<00:01:51.390> think<00:01:51.540> it's<00:01:51.630> really<00:01:51.840> gonna

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
both spots but I think it's really gonna

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.780 
both spots but I think it's really gonna
be<00:01:52.020> more<00:01:52.200> about<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.799> other<00:01:52.950> guys<00:01:53.189> development

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
be more about the other guys development

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.310 
be more about the other guys development
if<00:01:53.970> they<00:01:54.149> can<00:01:54.329> combine<00:01:54.600> that<00:01:54.869> other<00:01:55.049> guy<00:01:55.259> is

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
if they can combine that other guy is

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.800 
if they can combine that other guy is
going<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.649> be<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.829> third<00:01:56.420> lineman<00:01:57.420> there<00:01:57.570> who

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
going to be the third lineman there who

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.000 
going to be the third lineman there who
you<00:01:58.140> know<00:01:58.350> whether<00:01:58.560> it's<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.799> nose<00:01:58.950> tackle<00:01:59.369> or

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.010 
you know whether it's a nose tackle or

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.830 
you know whether it's a nose tackle or
and<00:02:00.130> then<00:02:00.610> they<00:02:00.730> can<00:02:00.850> adjust<00:02:01.150> move<00:02:01.390> jessie<00:02:01.540> run

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
and then they can adjust move jessie run

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.660 
and then they can adjust move jessie run
a<00:02:01.870> little<00:02:02.050> bit<00:02:02.260> with<00:02:02.890> the<00:02:03.010> understanding<00:02:03.280> that

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670

running back from connector already he's

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.960 
running back from connector already he's
a<00:03:02.650> guy<00:03:02.800> can<00:03:03.040> really<00:03:03.220> start<00:03:03.459> moving<00:03:03.760> up<00:03:03.850> by

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
a guy can really start moving up by

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.070 
a guy can really start moving up by
thinking<00:03:04.239> the<00:03:04.330> depth<00:03:04.540> chart<00:03:04.570> but<00:03:04.870> the<00:03:04.959> guy

of<00:05:21.559> those<00:05:21.619> guys<00:05:21.679> at<00:05:22.099> every<00:05:22.309> single<00:05:22.429> time<00:05:22.669> I<00:05:22.699> see

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:22.789

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:26.389 
kind of a different dimension I think if

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:27.879 
kind of a different dimension I think if
they<00:05:26.479> use<00:05:26.659> them<00:05:26.809> in<00:05:26.869> each<00:05:27.019> bag<00:05:27.229> but<00:05:27.409> yeah

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:27.889 
they use them in each bag but yeah

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:30.039 
they use them in each bag but yeah
Brandon<00:05:28.249> Lewis<00:05:28.339> it's<00:05:28.669> it's<00:05:28.969> it<00:05:29.809> looks<00:05:29.839> like

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:30.049 
Brandon Lewis it's it's it looks like

00:05:30.049 --> 00:05:31.659 
Brandon Lewis it's it's it looks like
it's<00:05:30.169> in<00:05:30.319> the<00:05:30.379> mix<00:05:30.559> more<00:05:30.709> at<00:05:30.919> least<00:05:31.399> that's<00:05:31.609> the

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:31.669 
it's in the mix more at least that's the

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:33.819 
it's in the mix more at least that's the
way<00:05:31.729> it<00:05:31.849> appear<00:05:32.059> to<00:05:32.149> be<00:05:32.269> so<00:05:32.559> that's<00:05:33.559> you<00:05:33.799> know
