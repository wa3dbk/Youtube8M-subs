00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.390
 stéphane ratel 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.909
 she showed a beautiful 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.430
 regularity she must confirm the number 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.290
 Ten silhouettes brand has presented 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.000
 by henri alex pantall the police come 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.110
 to impose on the pronouns of nantes 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.850
 this time the wolf is higher 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.890
 but its current form allows it to 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.780
 some hopes and number 8 6 to you 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.119
 ruby she seems barred to me for 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.920
 first places but its regularity 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:48.880
 experience also allow it 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:51.800
 some hopes 5 3 as 4 6 11 10 and 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.590
 concerning the price of wood for both 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.480
 years my favorite will be the 204 and other 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.880
 party I had the opportunity to speak 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.310
 the last time with penny 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.560
 it is a horse who love much 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.540
 very practical horse is brave and 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.130
 mature 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.720
 the horse has two wins in three 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.550
 races he was also meeting three 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.140
 in as many outings had he been 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.490
 disqualified from first place at 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.320
 his penultimate exit and this for 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.000
 have embarrassed a competitor as to horse 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.430
 in my opinion who here has the means to 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.260
 win this event so the 204 and 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.030
 other party he has a good mind he is 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.770
 hard to effort and I think him capable of 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.830
 play the leading roles in this price of 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:30.290
 wood for 4 years on 204 and nozer party to 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:33.350
 dax in meeting ii I targeted for you 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.910
 the second is that the 104 fail I 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.470
 know that didier guillemin she likes 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.670
 the horse has two second places 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.080
 in as many public outings and to my 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.130
 notice it should not be long before 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.900
 to impose itself in any case it would be a 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:45.290
 deserved victory his main rival 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.180
 will probably be the 203 after math that 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.890
 is a novel that depends on training 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.380
 of jean-claude rouget and as such he 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.720
 deserves trust 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.519
 from the outset 204 2 without 3 in the fourth 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.260
 I was able to talk michel cheno 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:59.360

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.910

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.590
 80th spanghero the horse just made 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.630
 his return on this racecourse of dax 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.519
 he has made good progress since and after 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.020
 Michel Chesneau the horse is ready to 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:10.940
 provide a basis 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.800
 a very good value that means he 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.720
 would be disappointed not to finish among the 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.960
 first three for couples and riot 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.030

 art that is close to his race and the 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.270
 305 pink memory case that must be redeemed 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.730
 which had started well 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:31.730

 the horse is certainly he is 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.940
 better when the left but it is in 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.740
 form and in its category after 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.440
 laurent the mazière the horse must 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.970
 take an accessit 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.220

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.720

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.130
