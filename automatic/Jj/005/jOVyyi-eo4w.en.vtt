what<00:00:12.900> I'm<00:00:12.990> talking<00:00:13.170> about<00:00:13.380> with<00:00:13.710> a<00:00:13.740> heating

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
what I'm talking about with a heating

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.210 
what I'm talking about with a heating
curve<00:00:14.690> in<00:00:15.690> your<00:00:15.929> reading<00:00:16.260> material<00:00:16.770> there<00:00:17.010> is

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
curve in your reading material there is

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.230 
curve in your reading material there is
a<00:00:17.490> typical<00:00:18.300> heating<00:00:18.630> curve<00:00:18.869> for<00:00:19.470> a<00:00:19.500> substance

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:20.240 
a typical heating curve for a substance

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.359 
a typical heating curve for a substance
and<00:00:21.240> what<00:00:21.420> this<00:00:21.600> shows<00:00:21.900> us<00:00:21.930> is<00:00:22.320> what<00:00:22.920> happens

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
and what this shows us is what happens

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.080 
and what this shows us is what happens
as<00:00:23.580> we<00:00:23.640> add<00:00:24.180> energy<00:00:24.689> to<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.619> substance<00:00:26.220> so<00:00:26.820> at

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
as we add energy to a substance so at

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.240 
as we add energy to a substance so at
low<00:00:27.510> temperatures<00:00:28.230> with<00:00:28.500> low<00:00:28.740> amounts<00:00:29.160> of

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
low temperatures with low amounts of

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.759 
low temperatures with low amounts of
energy<00:00:29.400> we're<00:00:29.880> going<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.269> have<00:00:30.449> our<00:00:31.109> substance

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
energy we're going to have our substance

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.520 
energy we're going to have our substance
in<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.070> form<00:00:32.279> of<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.460> solid<00:00:32.899> then<00:00:33.899> we<00:00:33.930> are<00:00:34.290> going

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
in the form of a solid then we are going

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.100 
in the form of a solid then we are going
to<00:00:34.680> add<00:00:34.890> heat<00:00:35.640> energy<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.540> solid<00:00:36.930> and

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
to add heat energy to the solid and

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.720 
to add heat energy to the solid and
while<00:00:37.590> we<00:00:37.739> do<00:00:37.890> that<00:00:38.100> it's<00:00:38.340> going<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.640> increase

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
while we do that it's going to increase

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.440 
while we do that it's going to increase
in<00:00:39.570> temperature<00:00:40.379> so<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:40.739> will<00:00:40.890> warm<00:00:41.160> up<00:00:41.450> it'll

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
in temperature so it will warm up it'll

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.810 
in temperature so it will warm up it'll
increase<00:00:42.840> in<00:00:42.989> temperature<00:00:43.410> until<00:00:43.950> it<00:00:44.010> gets<00:00:44.460> to

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
increase in temperature until it gets to

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.229 
increase in temperature until it gets to
that<00:00:45.090> substances<00:00:46.079> melting<00:00:46.829> point<00:00:47.160> at<00:00:47.489> that

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
that substances melting point at that

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.590 
that substances melting point at that
time<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:49.500> energy<00:00:49.980> will<00:00:50.190> no<00:00:50.460> longer<00:00:50.789> be<00:00:51.210> used

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
time the energy will no longer be used

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.920 
time the energy will no longer be used
to<00:00:52.140> increase<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.770> temperature<00:00:53.430> instead<00:00:54.360> that

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
to increase the temperature instead that

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.139 
to increase the temperature instead that
energy<00:00:55.469> that<00:00:55.649> we're<00:00:55.800> still<00:00:56.070> adding<00:00:56.399> is<00:00:56.910> going

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
energy that we're still adding is going

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.770 
energy that we're still adding is going
to<00:00:57.239> be<00:00:57.329> used<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.960> pull<00:00:58.739> apart<00:00:59.210> those<00:01:00.210> bonds

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
to be used to pull apart those bonds

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.439 
to be used to pull apart those bonds
holding<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.559> solid<00:01:02.010> together<00:01:02.550> so<00:01:03.090> it's<00:01:03.210> going

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
holding the solid together so it's going

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.660 
holding the solid together so it's going
to<00:01:03.719> pull<00:01:04.229> them<00:01:04.350> apart<00:01:04.470> just<00:01:04.979> a<00:01:05.100> little<00:01:05.339> bit<00:01:05.489> so

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
to pull them apart just a little bit so

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.640 
to pull them apart just a little bit so
that<00:01:05.700> they<00:01:05.970> can<00:01:06.180> now<00:01:06.390> move<00:01:06.720> around<00:01:07.170> each<00:01:07.409> other

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
that they can now move around each other

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.600 
that they can now move around each other
as<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.890> liquid<00:01:08.640> so<00:01:09.090> that<00:01:09.240> energy<00:01:10.130> will<00:01:11.130> allow

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
as a liquid so that energy will allow

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.719 
as a liquid so that energy will allow
them<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.080> become<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.380> liquid<00:01:13.710> so<00:01:14.280> that<00:01:14.400> they<00:01:14.549> can

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
them to become a liquid so that they can

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.050 
them to become a liquid so that they can
move<00:01:14.909> more<00:01:15.090> freely<00:01:15.710> then<00:01:16.710> at<00:01:17.040> once<00:01:17.460> all<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.939> it

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
move more freely then at once all of it

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.539 
move more freely then at once all of it
is<00:01:18.240> turned<00:01:18.990> into<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.320> liquid<00:01:19.770> which<00:01:19.950> once<00:01:20.400> all

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
is turned into a liquid which once all

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.330 
is turned into a liquid which once all
of<00:01:20.640> it<00:01:20.729> has<00:01:20.880> melted<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.479> liquid<00:01:22.439> is<00:01:22.619> then<00:01:22.950> free

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
of it has melted the liquid is then free

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.880 
of it has melted the liquid is then free
to<00:01:23.369> increase<00:01:24.330> in<00:01:24.570> temperature<00:01:25.200> as<00:01:25.350> we<00:01:25.710> add

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
to increase in temperature as we add

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.399 
to increase in temperature as we add
more<00:01:25.920> heat<00:01:26.549> so<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:27.299> temperature<00:01:27.750> will<00:01:27.780> go<00:01:27.960> up

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
more heat so the temperature will go up

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.090 
more heat so the temperature will go up
until<00:01:29.130> we<00:01:29.310> reach<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.880> boiling<00:01:30.509> point<00:01:30.950> so<00:01:31.950> when

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
until we reach the boiling point so when

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.760 
until we reach the boiling point so when
we<00:01:32.189> reach<00:01:32.400> this<00:01:32.610> boiling<00:01:33.060> point<00:01:33.470> we<00:01:34.470> are<00:01:34.500> going

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
we reach this boiling point we are going

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.399 
we reach this boiling point we are going
to<00:01:35.220> again<00:01:35.700> instead<00:01:36.270> of<00:01:36.329> this<00:01:36.780> energy<00:01:37.229> that's

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
to again instead of this energy that's

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.620 
to again instead of this energy that's
still<00:01:37.650> being<00:01:37.799> added<00:01:38.479> increasing<00:01:39.479> our

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
still being added increasing our

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.480 
still being added increasing our
temperature<00:01:40.290> it's<00:01:40.860> going<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.130> go<00:01:41.220> straight

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
temperature it's going to go straight

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.249 
temperature it's going to go straight
across<00:01:41.610> here<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.240> temperature<00:01:42.659> won't<00:01:42.810> change

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
across here the temperature won't change

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.710 
across here the temperature won't change
until<00:01:44.070> all<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.520> liquid<00:01:44.700> has<00:01:45.030> turned<00:01:45.329> into<00:01:45.570> a

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
until all the liquid has turned into a

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.030 
until all the liquid has turned into a
gas<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.549> they<00:01:47.549> have<00:01:47.850> broken<00:01:48.270> free

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
gas and they have broken free

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.910 
gas and they have broken free
one<00:01:49.220> another<00:01:49.520> and<00:01:49.870> can<00:01:50.870> then<00:01:51.080> move<00:01:51.290> around<00:01:51.590> as

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
one another and can then move around as

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.910 
one another and can then move around as
gas<00:01:52.790> particles<00:01:53.570> which<00:01:53.900> go<00:01:54.170> off<00:01:54.410> in<00:01:54.710> all

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
gas particles which go off in all

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.350 
gas particles which go off in all
directions<00:01:54.950> and<00:01:55.550> fill<00:01:55.760> up<00:01:55.880> all<00:01:56.090> available

space<00:01:57.040> so<00:01:58.040> when<00:01:58.190> we<00:01:58.280> talk<00:01:58.550> about<00:01:58.600> melting

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
space so when we talk about melting

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.290

point and boiling point we're talking

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.020 
point and boiling point we're talking
about<00:02:02.390> the<00:02:02.660> temperatures<00:02:03.410> at<00:02:03.680> which<00:02:04.220> this

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
about the temperatures at which this

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.730 
about the temperatures at which this

that<00:02:57.320> would<00:02:58.070> be<00:02:58.280> freezing<00:02:58.970> we<00:02:59.420> know<00:02:59.570> if<00:02:59.660> we<00:02:59.780> had

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
that would be freezing we know if we had

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.930 
liquid water and we turned it to a solid
we<00:03:02.600> would<00:03:02.810> have<00:03:03.050> frozen<00:03:03.350> it<00:03:03.709> from<00:03:04.280> liquid

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
we would have frozen it from liquid

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.440 
we would have frozen it from liquid
water<00:03:05.120> into<00:03:05.630> ice<00:03:06.370> so<00:03:07.370> as<00:03:07.610> you<00:03:07.790> go<00:03:07.940> through<00:03:08.239> here

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
water into ice so as you go through here

water into ice so as you go through here
and<00:03:08.480> answer<00:03:08.810> these<00:03:08.930> questions<00:03:09.380> pay<00:03:09.620> attention

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
and answer these questions pay attention

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.430 
and answer these questions pay attention
to<00:03:10.130> that<00:03:10.310> graph<00:03:10.549> in<00:03:10.730> this<00:03:10.880> one<00:03:11.090> and<00:03:11.299> then<00:03:11.440> one

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
to that graph in this one and then one

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.560 
to that graph in this one and then one
thing<00:03:12.560> I<00:03:12.650> do<00:03:12.709> want<00:03:12.980> to<00:03:13.010> point<00:03:13.280> out<00:03:13.430> it<00:03:14.209> does

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
thing I do want to point out it does

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.440 
thing I do want to point out it does
show<00:03:14.959> here<00:03:15.500> it<00:03:16.280> talks<00:03:16.430> about<00:03:16.610> potential<00:03:17.299> and

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
show here it talks about potential and

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.370 
show here it talks about potential and
kinetic<00:03:17.810> energy<00:03:18.580> when<00:03:19.580> we<00:03:19.610> warm<00:03:20.209> up<00:03:20.420> particles

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
kinetic energy when we warm up particles

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.820 
kinetic energy when we warm up particles
as<00:03:21.620> we<00:03:22.160> warm<00:03:22.400> them<00:03:22.610> up<00:03:22.790> they<00:03:23.209> will<00:03:23.420> move<00:03:23.830> more

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
as we warm them up they will move more

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.190 
as we warm them up they will move more
alright<00:03:25.310> and<00:03:25.519> kinetic<00:03:26.269> energy<00:03:26.720> is<00:03:26.900> the<00:03:27.170> energy

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
alright and kinetic energy is the energy

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.070 
alright and kinetic energy is the energy
of<00:03:27.650> motion<00:03:27.860> the<00:03:28.670> energy

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
of motion the energy

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.890 
of motion the energy
movement<00:03:29.590> so<00:03:30.490> the<00:03:30.670> more<00:03:31.030> those<00:03:31.330> particles

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
movement so the more those particles

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.650 
movement so the more those particles
move<00:03:32.170> the<00:03:32.440> more<00:03:32.560> kinetic<00:03:33.340> energy<00:03:34.090> they<00:03:34.330> have

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
move the more kinetic energy they have

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.850 
move the more kinetic energy they have
and<00:03:34.960> as<00:03:35.820> temperature<00:03:36.960> increases<00:03:37.960> they<00:03:38.590> will

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
and as temperature increases they will

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.380 
and as temperature increases they will
move<00:03:39.160> more<00:03:40.060> so<00:03:40.780> when<00:03:41.470> I<00:03:41.500> warm<00:03:41.920> up<00:03:42.040> a<00:03:42.190> solid<00:03:42.730> the

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
move more so when I warm up a solid the

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.090 
move more so when I warm up a solid the
particles<00:03:43.810> of<00:03:43.900> a<00:03:43.990> solid<00:03:44.350> aren't<00:03:44.620> necessarily

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
particles of a solid aren't necessarily

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.730 
particles of a solid aren't necessarily
moving<00:03:45.670> around<00:03:46.090> but<00:03:46.510> they<00:03:46.630> do<00:03:46.690> vibrate

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:47.740 
moving around but they do vibrate

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.130 
moving around but they do vibrate
to<00:03:48.520> a<00:03:48.550> greater<00:03:48.880> degree<00:03:49.150> as<00:03:49.480> I<00:03:49.660> warm<00:03:49.930> them<00:03:50.110> up

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
to a greater degree as I warm them up

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.380 
to a greater degree as I warm them up
your<00:03:50.920> liquid<00:03:51.430> will<00:03:51.610> start<00:03:51.640> to<00:03:52.000> move<00:03:52.150> around

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
your liquid will start to move around

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.080 
your liquid will start to move around
more<00:03:52.870> as<00:03:53.080> it's<00:03:53.410> heated<00:03:53.620> up<00:03:53.920> and<00:03:54.100> your<00:03:54.430> gas<00:03:54.730> will

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
more as it's heated up and your gas will

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.570 
more as it's heated up and your gas will
bounce<00:03:55.330> around<00:03:55.570> quite<00:03:56.080> a<00:03:56.110> bit<00:03:56.230> more<00:03:56.530> when<00:03:57.370> it

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 
bounce around quite a bit more when it

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.090 
bounce around quite a bit more when it
is<00:03:57.760> heated<00:03:58.150> so<00:03:58.660> as<00:03:58.960> the<00:03:59.590> temperature

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
is heated so as the temperature

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.220 
is heated so as the temperature
increases<00:04:00.220> our<00:04:00.940> kinetic<00:04:01.360> energy<00:04:01.900> increases

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
increases our kinetic energy increases

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.070 
increases our kinetic energy increases

the<00:04:06.940> average<00:04:07.240> kinetic<00:04:07.510> energy<00:04:07.780> of<00:04:08.080> the

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
the average kinetic energy of the

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.810 
the average kinetic energy of the
particles<00:04:09.520> in<00:04:09.640> that<00:04:09.820> substance<00:04:10.290> and<00:04:11.820> here

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:12.820 
particles in that substance and here

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.480 
particles in that substance and here
we're<00:04:13.360> going<00:04:13.390> to<00:04:13.690> be<00:04:13.990> breaking<00:04:14.290> our<00:04:14.920> solid

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:15.490 
we're going to be breaking our solid

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.270 
we're going to be breaking our solid
apart<00:04:15.820> to<00:04:15.970> a<00:04:16.000> liquid<00:04:16.420> or<00:04:16.830> breaking<00:04:17.830> our<00:04:17.950> liquid

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
apart to a liquid or breaking our liquid

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.330 
apart to a liquid or breaking our liquid
apart<00:04:18.609> to<00:04:19.000> a<00:04:19.030> gas<00:04:19.530> so<00:04:20.530> that<00:04:20.709> it'll<00:04:20.950> have<00:04:21.190> the

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
apart to a gas so that it'll have the

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.230 
apart to a gas so that it'll have the
ability<00:04:22.060> to<00:04:22.090> then<00:04:22.720> get<00:04:23.020> faster<00:04:23.680> again<00:04:24.010> so<00:04:25.000> that

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
ability to then get faster again so that

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.300 
ability to then get faster again so that
has<00:04:25.450> to<00:04:25.660> do<00:04:25.840> with<00:04:26.050> kinetic<00:04:26.800> and<00:04:26.980> potential

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
has to do with kinetic and potential

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.420 
has to do with kinetic and potential
energy<00:04:27.850> and<00:04:28.090> then<00:04:28.840> this<00:04:29.110> word

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
energy and then this word

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.470 
energy and then this word
crystallization<00:04:30.430> think<00:04:31.060> about<00:04:31.300> what's

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:31.480 
crystallization think about what's

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.620 
crystallization think about what's
happening<00:04:32.080> when<00:04:32.320> a<00:04:32.500> crystal<00:04:33.220> forms<00:04:33.970> and<00:04:34.240> that

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
happening when a crystal forms and that

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.420 
happening when a crystal forms and that
should<00:04:34.930> help<00:04:35.110> you<00:04:35.290> to<00:04:35.320> answer<00:04:35.590> that<00:04:35.950> question

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
should help you to answer that question

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.240 
should help you to answer that question
so<00:04:37.060> if<00:04:37.360> you<00:04:37.570> do<00:04:37.840> get<00:04:38.050> stuck<00:04:38.380> on<00:04:38.530> this<00:04:38.740> at<00:04:38.890> all<00:04:38.980> or

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
so if you do get stuck on this at all or

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.010 
so if you do get stuck on this at all or
do<00:04:39.580> you<00:04:39.640> have<00:04:39.820> any<00:04:40.030> more<00:04:40.240> questions<00:04:40.780> please

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
do you have any more questions please

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.890 
do you have any more questions please
come<00:04:41.620> ask
