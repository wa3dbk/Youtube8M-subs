so now let's kind of hook it up so first

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.540 
so now let's kind of hook it up so first
first<00:00:39.720> thing<00:00:40.020> I'll<00:00:40.170> show<00:00:40.380> you<00:00:43.220> you<00:00:44.220> hear<00:00:44.400> this

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
first thing I'll show you you hear this

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.150 
first thing I'll show you you hear this
a<00:00:44.610> lot<00:00:45.200> so<00:00:46.200> what<00:00:46.320> I<00:00:46.350> did<00:00:46.470> was<00:00:46.860> D<00:00:47.760> e-flat<00:00:49.160> and

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
a lot so what I did was D e-flat and

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:59.750 
a lot so what I did was D e-flat and
then<00:00:50.340> C<00:00:50.610> e<00:00:50.640> together<00:00:51.210> in<00:00:51.360> my<00:00:51.449> left<00:00:51.660> hand<00:00:58.519> in<00:00:59.519> my

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
then C e together in my left hand in my

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:13.249 
then C e together in my left hand in my
right<00:01:00.750> hand<00:01:02.720> B<00:01:03.720> flat<00:01:04.050> E<00:01:06.320> flat<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:08.160> a<00:01:08.850> flat<00:01:12.259> so

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:13.259 
right hand B flat E flat and a flat so

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:15.980 
right hand B flat E flat and a flat so
that's<00:01:13.470> one<00:01:13.830> possibility<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:15.240> take<00:01:15.509> this<00:01:15.690> same

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
that's one possibility it take this same

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.980 
that's one possibility it take this same
chords<00:01:16.440> to<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.710> next<00:01:17.070> level<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.869> instead<00:01:18.869> of

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
chords to the next level and instead of

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.249 
chords to the next level and instead of
doing<00:01:19.320> that<00:01:19.640> then<00:01:20.640> little<00:01:21.270> walk-up<00:01:21.780> we<00:01:21.930> can<00:01:22.110> do

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
doing that then little walk-up we can do

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.240 
doing that then little walk-up we can do
a<00:01:22.289> C<00:01:22.649> free<00:01:23.160> B<00:01:23.820> flat<00:01:24.649> then<00:01:25.649> to<00:01:25.860> do<00:01:25.979> something

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
a C free B flat then to do something

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.359 
a C free B flat then to do something
like<00:01:26.369> this<00:01:26.610> so<00:01:26.880> see<00:01:27.210> me<00:01:27.630> find<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.050> left<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.500> my

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
like this so see me find the left and my

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.520 
like this so see me find the left and my
right<00:01:29.399> I<00:01:29.729> have<00:01:29.880> E<00:01:30.800> flat<00:01:31.800> I<00:01:32.610> have<00:01:33.179> an<00:01:33.390> A<00:01:33.539> flat<00:01:33.780> C

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
right I have E flat I have an A flat C

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.399 
right I have E flat I have an A flat C
and<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.770> fun<00:01:35.600> that's<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.750> possibility

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
and a fun that's a possibility

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.679 
and a fun that's a possibility
so<00:01:37.680> more<00:01:37.860> from<00:01:38.009> here<00:01:40.729> we<00:01:41.729> can<00:01:41.850> also<00:01:42.090> use<00:01:42.509> the

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
so more from here we can also use the

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.420 
so more from here we can also use the
same<00:01:42.960> tracks<00:01:43.290> home<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:44.070> just<00:01:44.250> play<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.460> D

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
same tracks home and just play a D

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.950 
same tracks home and just play a D
sometimes<00:01:47.430> I'll<00:01:47.790> do<00:01:47.939> this<00:01:49.340> so<00:01:50.340> same<00:01:50.970> st.<00:01:51.750> I

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
sometimes I'll do this so same st. I

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.170 
sometimes I'll do this so same st. I
don't<00:01:52.310> see<00:01:53.310> e<00:01:54.439> D<00:01:55.439> flat<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:56.490> sometimes<00:01:57.000> I'll

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
don't see e D flat and sometimes I'll

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.789 
don't see e D flat and sometimes I'll
come<00:01:57.420> under<00:01:57.720> it<00:01:57.840> I<00:01:57.990> play<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.820> D<00:02:00.770> G<00:02:01.770> flat<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.490> a

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
come under it I play a D G flat and a

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:07.399 
come under it I play a D G flat and a
pilot<00:02:04.829> I'll<00:02:05.040> just<00:02:05.430> invert<00:02:05.820> play<00:02:06.630> here<00:02:06.960> so

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
pilot I'll just invert play here so

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:14.680 
pilot I'll just invert play here so
that's<00:02:08.250> a<00:02:08.369> possibility<00:02:08.790> on<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.209> 7th<00:02:09.600> so

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.320 

so<00:02:15.690> we<00:02:15.810> have<00:02:15.990> that<00:02:16.370> we<00:02:17.370> can<00:02:17.520> also<00:02:17.700> do<00:02:18.030> something

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
so we have that we can also do something

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.580 
so we have that we can also do something
like<00:02:18.510> this<00:02:18.840> you<00:02:19.590> just<00:02:20.190> do<00:02:20.810> use<00:02:21.810> that<00:02:22.050> C<00:02:22.350> as<00:02:22.560> a

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
like this you just do use that C as a

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.050 
like this you just do use that C as a
minor<00:02:24.470> you<00:02:25.470> know<00:02:25.530> whenever<00:02:26.250> a<00:02:26.430> minor<00:02:26.670> stuff

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
minor you know whenever a minor stuff

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.960 
minor you know whenever a minor stuff
you<00:02:27.240> normally<00:02:27.750> do<00:02:28.050> over<00:02:28.320> C<00:02:28.560> you<00:02:29.220> can<00:02:29.430> do<00:02:29.550> that<00:02:29.730> I

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
you normally do over C you can do that I

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.910 
you normally do over C you can do that I
will<00:02:30.630> play<00:02:30.840> my<00:02:31.050> core<00:02:31.320> like<00:02:31.560> this<00:02:31.800> C<00:02:32.610> E<00:02:32.880> flat<00:02:33.390> G<00:02:34.050> B

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
will play my core like this C E flat G B

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:43.880 
will play my core like this C E flat G B
flat<00:02:36.290> I'm<00:02:37.290> gonna<00:02:37.440> do<00:02:37.530> it<00:02:37.650> if<00:02:38.300> B<00:02:39.300> flat<00:02:39.660> C<00:02:40.560> E<00:02:41.210> F<00:02:42.890> how

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
flat I'm gonna do it if B flat C E F how

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:50.960 
flat I'm gonna do it if B flat C E F how
does<00:02:44.070> sound<00:02:44.250> like<00:02:44.370> that<00:02:49.430> that<00:02:50.430> would<00:02:50.640> be<00:02:50.700> my

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.340 
flat stuff so I'll do it a flat G B flat
E<00:03:30.510> flat<00:03:32.060> and<00:03:33.060> I'll<00:03:33.150> drop<00:03:33.330> it<00:03:33.510> to<00:03:33.600> a<00:03:33.630> B<00:03:33.840> flat<00:03:33.990> for

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
E flat and I'll drop it to a B flat for

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.290 
E flat and I'll drop it to a B flat for
what's<00:03:35.070> an<00:03:35.190> F<00:03:35.400> B<00:03:35.730> flat<00:03:35.760> F<00:03:37.700> right<00:03:38.700> or<00:03:39.030> I'll<00:03:39.180> do

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
what's an F B flat F right or I'll do

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:47.510 
what's an F B flat F right or I'll do
something<00:03:39.540> like<00:03:39.630> this

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:47.520 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:04:02.000 

F<00:03:48.520> B<00:03:49.210> flat<00:03:50.520> D<00:03:51.520> flat<00:03:51.550> D<00:03:54.990> b-flat<00:03:55.990> yeah<00:03:58.260> B<00:03:59.260> flat<00:04:00.660> D

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
F B flat D flat D b-flat yeah B flat D

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:07.020 
F B flat D flat D b-flat yeah B flat D
and<00:04:03.010> so<00:04:03.190> you<00:04:03.250> can<00:04:03.520> hear<00:04:04.740> it's<00:04:05.740> all<00:04:05.950> I'm<00:04:06.760> playing

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
and so you can hear it's all I'm playing

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:23.850 
and so you can hear it's all I'm playing
something<00:04:07.360> like<00:04:07.450> this<00:04:22.380> so<00:04:23.380> again<00:04:23.680> it<00:04:23.830> just

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
something like this so again it just

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.530 
something like this so again it just
depends<00:04:24.580> on<00:04:24.730> the<00:04:25.530> on<00:04:26.530> the<00:04:27.180> situation<00:04:28.180> where

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.540 
depends on the on the situation where

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.740 
depends on the on the situation where
you're<00:04:28.690> trying<00:04:28.810> to<00:04:29.050> go<00:04:29.820> that<00:04:30.820> time<00:04:30.880> I<00:04:31.300> just<00:04:31.330> use

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
you're trying to go that time I just use

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.050 
you're trying to go that time I just use
that<00:04:31.960> C<00:04:32.290> to<00:04:32.560> pass<00:04:32.800> me<00:04:33.010> to<00:04:33.130> the<00:04:33.250> F<00:04:33.430> because<00:04:33.820> I<00:04:33.910> was

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
that C to pass me to the F because I was

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.790 
that C to pass me to the F because I was
going<00:04:34.270> to<00:04:34.600> the<00:04:34.780> B<00:04:34.960> flat<00:04:35.430> all<00:04:36.430> right<00:04:37.800> anything

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
going to the B flat all right anything

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.600 
going to the B flat all right anything
else<00:04:39.130> I<00:04:39.220> would<00:04:39.400> do<00:04:39.490> something<00:04:39.790> like<00:04:39.850> this<00:04:39.940> I

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
else I would do something like this I

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.730 
else I would do something like this I
would<00:04:42.610> do<00:04:42.910> this<00:04:43.090> so<00:04:43.450> sometimes<00:04:43.840> I'll<00:04:44.170> walk

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
would do this so sometimes I'll walk

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.100 
would do this so sometimes I'll walk
this

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:56.960 

all<00:04:49.110> right<00:04:49.380> so<00:04:51.530> C<00:04:52.530> E<00:04:53.160> flat<00:04:53.490> G<00:04:55.640> eighth<00:04:56.640> one

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
all right so C E flat G eighth one

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:01.310 
all right so C E flat G eighth one
alright<00:04:57.540> so

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:06.710 

so<00:05:02.320> that's<00:05:02.620> a<00:05:02.860> that's<00:05:03.220> a<00:05:03.820> good<00:05:04.030> one<00:05:04.300> to<00:05:04.540> have

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 
so that's a that's a good one to have

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.630 
so that's a that's a good one to have
very<00:05:07.720> similar<00:05:08.260> to<00:05:08.560> this<00:05:08.830> one<00:05:08.890> that<00:05:09.340> we<00:05:09.610> just

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:09.640 
very similar to this one that we just

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:17.250 
very similar to this one that we just
did<00:05:09.970> okay<00:05:13.140> so<00:05:14.140> you<00:05:14.200> have<00:05:14.560> that<00:05:15.930> for<00:05:16.930> the<00:05:17.020> most

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:17.260 
did okay so you have that for the most

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.610 
did okay so you have that for the most
part<00:05:17.620> that's<00:05:17.920> it<00:05:18.390> there<00:05:19.390> are<00:05:19.660> very<00:05:20.080> few<00:05:20.560> times

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
part that's it there are very few times

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.040 
part that's it there are very few times
when<00:05:21.280> I'm<00:05:21.430> playing<00:05:21.670> in<00:05:21.910> the<00:05:22.000> key<00:05:22.240> of<00:05:22.480> D<00:05:23.020> flat

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.050 
when I'm playing in the key of D flat

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.480 
when I'm playing in the key of D flat
that<00:05:23.770> I'll<00:05:23.890> play<00:05:24.280> a<00:05:24.310> C<00:05:25.170> C<00:05:26.170> minor<00:05:26.440> I<00:05:26.770> mean<00:05:27.010> a<00:05:27.190> C

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
that I'll play a C C minor I mean a C

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.660 
that I'll play a C C minor I mean a C
major<00:05:27.760> chord<00:05:28.440> but<00:05:29.440> again<00:05:30.070> anything's

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:30.670 
major chord but again anything's

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:34.130 
major chord but again anything's
possible<00:05:30.760> so<00:05:31.660> so<00:05:32.410> I<00:05:32.470> wouldn't<00:05:32.830> close<00:05:33.160> I

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:34.140 
possible so so I wouldn't close I

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:38.760 
possible so so I wouldn't close I
wouldn't<00:05:35.140> closed<00:05:35.380> the<00:05:35.590> door<00:05:35.830> on<00:05:36.100> that<00:05:36.160> but<00:05:37.770> the

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:38.770 
wouldn't closed the door on that but the

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:42.450 
wouldn't closed the door on that but the
ones<00:05:38.980> I<00:05:39.100> showed<00:05:39.340> you<00:05:39.610> who<00:05:39.850> are<00:05:41.220> primarily<00:05:42.220> the

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.460 
ones I showed you who are primarily the

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:47.010 
ones I showed you who are primarily the
ones<00:05:42.640> that<00:05:42.880> I'll<00:05:43.030> play<00:05:45.450> in<00:05:46.450> this<00:05:46.660> sort<00:05:46.960> of

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:47.020 
ones that I'll play in this sort of

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:50.010 
ones that I'll play in this sort of
application<00:05:47.520> all<00:05:48.520> right<00:05:48.760> so<00:05:49.600> that's<00:05:49.870> the

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:50.020 
application all right so that's the

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.790 
application all right so that's the
seven<00:05:50.530> and<00:05:50.800> now<00:05:51.700> we're<00:05:52.000> ready<00:05:52.270> to<00:05:52.990> apply<00:05:53.170> all

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:53.800 
seven and now we're ready to apply all

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:59.490 
seven and now we're ready to apply all
of<00:05:54.400> these<00:05:54.610> different<00:05:55.410> chords<00:05:57.030> to<00:05:58.030> songs<00:05:58.500> but

00:05:59.490 --> 00:05:59.500 
of these different chords to songs but

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.470 
of these different chords to songs but
before<00:06:00.010> we<00:06:00.130> get<00:06:00.250> to<00:06:00.400> songs<00:06:00.640> we're<00:06:01.000> going<00:06:01.180> to<00:06:01.300> do

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:01.480 
before we get to songs we're going to do

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:05.790 
before we get to songs we're going to do
chord<00:06:01.930> progressions<00:06:03.150> so<00:06:04.150> we<00:06:04.330> know<00:06:04.630> what<00:06:05.350> leads

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:05.800 
chord progressions so we know what leads

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:10.590 
chord progressions so we know what leads
to<00:06:05.980> what<00:06:06.150> you<00:06:07.150> know<00:06:07.330> if<00:06:08.110> I'm<00:06:08.530> in<00:06:09.370> a<00:06:09.400> DM<00:06:09.970> if<00:06:10.210> I'm

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:10.600 
to what you know if I'm in a DM if I'm

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:15.960 
to what you know if I'm in a DM if I'm
in<00:06:10.780> D<00:06:11.020> flat<00:06:11.430> I<00:06:12.430> want<00:06:13.420> to<00:06:13.510> get<00:06:13.720> to<00:06:14.080> a<00:06:14.440> six<00:06:15.100> what

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:15.970 
in D flat I want to get to a six what

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:20.370 
in D flat I want to get to a six what
can<00:06:16.120> I<00:06:16.210> do<00:06:16.270> to<00:06:16.570> get<00:06:16.750> me<00:06:16.930> to<00:06:17.080> the<00:06:17.230> six<00:06:17.530> I<00:06:19.290> can<00:06:20.290> do

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:20.380 
can I do to get me to the six I can do

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.190 
can I do to get me to the six I can do
something<00:06:20.740> like<00:06:20.860> that<00:06:21.100> so<00:06:21.940> we'll<00:06:22.750> talk<00:06:22.990> about

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:23.200 
something like that so we'll talk about

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.790 
something like that so we'll talk about
all<00:06:23.680> that<00:06:24.130> information<00:06:25.120> but<00:06:25.750> before<00:06:26.200> you<00:06:26.410> jump

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:26.800 
all that information but before you jump

all that information but before you jump
to<00:06:26.920> the<00:06:27.160> section<00:06:27.580> in<00:06:27.670> which<00:06:27.790> we<00:06:27.940> talk<00:06:28.120> about

to the section in which we talk about

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.410 
to the section in which we talk about
core<00:06:28.780> progressions<00:06:29.740> make<00:06:30.370> sure<00:06:30.610> you<00:06:30.910> have<00:06:31.180> I

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:31.420 
core progressions make sure you have I

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:32.790 
core progressions make sure you have I
mean<00:06:31.630> you<00:06:31.720> don't<00:06:31.810> have<00:06:31.930> to<00:06:32.080> have<00:06:32.260> all<00:06:32.530> the

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:32.800 
mean you don't have to have all the

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.550 
mean you don't have to have all the
cores<00:06:33.040> we<00:06:33.220> talked<00:06:33.460> about<00:06:33.610> but<00:06:34.450> have<00:06:34.720> at<00:06:35.290> least

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:35.560 
cores we talked about but have at least

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.730 
cores we talked about but have at least
the<00:06:36.040> the<00:06:36.070> basic<00:06:36.730> ones<00:06:36.970> mastered<00:06:37.600> so<00:06:38.560> that

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:38.740 
the the basic ones mastered so that
