be able to center the screen to do this

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.560 
be able to center the screen to do this
and<00:01:13.530> even<00:01:14.460> if<00:01:14.549> you<00:01:14.640> run<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.909> perfect<00:01:15.299> route<00:01:15.420> in

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
and even if you run the perfect route in

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.300 
and even if you run the perfect route in
the<00:01:15.659> Call<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:15.840> Duty<00:01:16.080> campaign<00:01:16.500> that's<00:01:17.100> what

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
the Call of Duty campaign that's what

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.289 
the Call of Duty campaign that's what
I've<00:01:17.430> learned<00:01:17.640> so<00:01:17.850> far

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
I've learned so far

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.390 
I've learned so far
you<00:01:18.840> can<00:01:19.020> still<00:01:19.259> die<00:01:19.470> because<00:01:20.070> they're

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
you can still die because they're

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.410 
you can still die because they're
essentially<00:01:21.210> is<00:01:21.360> no<00:01:21.600> perfect<00:01:22.290> route

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
essentially is no perfect route

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.460 
essentially is no perfect route
sometimes<00:01:24.420> with<00:01:24.600> veteran<00:01:24.900> mode<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.439> have

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
sometimes with veteran mode you have

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.020 
sometimes with veteran mode you have
you'll<00:01:25.860> be<00:01:25.920> able<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.100> take<00:01:26.220> six<00:01:26.460> seven<00:01:26.790> shots

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
you'll be able to take six seven shots

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.030 
you'll be able to take six seven shots
and<00:01:27.540> other<00:01:27.750> times<00:01:28.049> you'll<00:01:28.439> be<00:01:28.530> down<00:01:28.680> in<00:01:28.860> two

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040

double<00:05:44.590> trouble<00:05:44.949> I<00:05:45.099> go<00:05:45.460> for<00:05:45.759> the<00:05:45.970> full<00:05:46.150> auto

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 
double trouble I go for the full auto

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.450 
double trouble I go for the full auto
CZs<00:05:48.160> and<00:05:48.430> that's<00:05:48.819> where<00:05:49.090> we<00:05:49.210> go<00:05:49.360> to<00:05:50.340> then<00:05:51.340> you

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:51.460 
CZs and that's where we go to then you

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:52.860 
CZs and that's where we go to then you
got<00:05:51.610> to<00:05:51.699> defend<00:05:51.819> yourself<00:05:52.330> here<00:05:52.479> I<00:05:52.539> like<00:05:52.780> to

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:52.870 
got to defend yourself here I like to

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.330 
got to defend yourself here I like to
come<00:05:53.020> over<00:05:53.050> here<00:05:53.380> in<00:05:53.620> this<00:05:53.800> sections<00:05:54.190> where<00:05:54.280> I

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:54.340 
come over here in this sections where I

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:55.969 
come over here in this sections where I
found<00:05:54.580> that<00:05:54.759> is<00:05:54.849> the<00:05:54.940> most<00:05:55.150> easiest<00:05:55.539> to<00:05:55.750> hold

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:55.979 
found that is the most easiest to hold

00:05:55.979 --> 00:05:58.260 
found that is the most easiest to hold
mainly<00:05:56.979> because<00:05:57.099> there's<00:05:57.430> a<00:05:57.550> quick<00:05:57.819> area<00:05:58.150> that

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:58.270 
mainly because there's a quick area that

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:02.309 
mainly because there's a quick area that
we<00:05:58.330> can<00:05:58.479> go<00:05:58.569> into<00:05:58.960> and<00:05:59.639> then<00:06:00.639> I<00:06:00.669> ran<00:06:00.940> back<00:06:01.319> that

00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:02.319 
we can go into and then I ran back that

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:03.689 
we can go into and then I ran back that
running<00:06:02.590> back<00:06:02.620> sometimes<00:06:03.220> works<00:06:03.460> sometimes

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:03.699 
running back sometimes works sometimes

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:05.879 
running back sometimes works sometimes
doesn't<00:06:04.300> it<00:06:04.330> worked<00:06:04.659> in<00:06:04.810> this<00:06:04.960> case<00:06:05.199> I<00:06:05.500> never

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:05.889 
doesn't it worked in this case I never

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:07.529 
doesn't it worked in this case I never
really<00:06:06.220> worked<00:06:06.400> out<00:06:06.550> a<00:06:06.610> solid<00:06:06.880> strategy<00:06:07.240> for
