 It seems to have been separated but it is the same 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:21.680
 It's now in one set of cases without separation. 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:25.580
 So you can use it as a set, and you can split a lot of these bands .

 Even if I put the iPad tone too hard, it is a little bit the same size. 

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:45.440
