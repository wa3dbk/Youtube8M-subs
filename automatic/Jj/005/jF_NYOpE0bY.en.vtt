small circular petals and five large
circular<00:02:13.110> pillows<00:02:13.760> I'm<00:02:14.760> using<00:02:15.209> two<00:02:15.480> different

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
circular pillows I'm using two different

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.810 
circular pillows I'm using two different
colors<00:02:15.870> right<00:02:16.410> there<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:17.100> white<00:02:17.340> one<00:02:17.610> is

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
colors right there the white one is

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.330 
colors right there the white one is
actually<00:02:18.320> translucent<00:02:19.320> so<00:02:19.590> after<00:02:19.920> I<00:02:19.950> bake<00:02:20.310> it

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
actually translucent so after I bake it

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.810 
actually translucent so after I bake it
it<00:02:20.730> will<00:02:20.910> show<00:02:20.940> up<00:02:21.329> kind<00:02:21.930> of<00:02:22.049> like<00:02:22.200> clear<00:02:22.820> be

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
it will show up kind of like clear be

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:24.979 
it will show up kind of like clear be
sure<00:02:24.060> to<00:02:24.299> play<00:02:24.480> around<00:02:24.720> with<00:02:24.930> different

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
sure to play around with different

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.250 
sure to play around with different
colors<00:02:25.530> to<00:02:25.829> see<00:02:26.040> different<00:02:26.459> results<00:02:27.260> flatten

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
colors to see different results flatten

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.740 
colors to see different results flatten
all<00:02:28.440> of<00:02:28.620> them<00:02:28.769> like<00:02:28.980> a<00:02:29.010> pancake<00:02:29.340> dish

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
all of them like a pancake dish

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.320 
all of them like a pancake dish

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
on a sigh if the petal just got to it

the<00:03:01.840> same<00:03:02.080> to<00:03:02.230> the<00:03:02.350> rest<00:03:02.560> of<00:03:02.710> the<00:03:02.800> two<00:03:03.010> small

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
the same to the rest of the two small

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.540 
the same to the rest of the two small
petals<00:03:04.260> making<00:03:05.260> the<00:03:05.380> roses<00:03:05.830> seems<00:03:06.070> kind<00:03:06.430> of

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
petals making the roses seems kind of

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.940 
petals making the roses seems kind of
hard<00:03:06.760> but<00:03:06.970> is<00:03:07.120> actually<00:03:07.300> easy<00:03:07.959> it's<00:03:08.560> just<00:03:08.800> a

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
hard but is actually easy it's just a

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.210 
hard but is actually easy it's just a
very<00:03:09.220> small<00:03:09.670> delicate<00:03:10.300> work<00:03:10.510> I'm<00:03:11.010> using<00:03:12.010> a

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
very small delicate work I'm using a

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.370 
very small delicate work I'm using a
pointy<00:03:12.580> metal<00:03:12.730> bar<00:03:13.090> tools<00:03:13.450> if<00:03:13.810> you<00:03:14.020> don't<00:03:14.200> have

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
pointy metal bar tools if you don't have

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.490 
pointy metal bar tools if you don't have
this<00:03:14.560> you<00:03:14.800> can<00:03:14.830> use<00:03:15.220> to<00:03:15.520> pick<00:03:16.500> you're

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
this you can use to pick you're

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.050 
this you can use to pick you're
essentially<00:03:17.830> using<00:03:18.280> the<00:03:18.310> same<00:03:18.610> technique<00:03:19.030> to

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
essentially using the same technique to

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.500 
essentially using the same technique to
attach<00:03:19.630> the<00:03:19.900> big<00:03:20.110> petals<00:03:20.760> but<00:03:21.760> as<00:03:21.940> for<00:03:22.209> the<00:03:22.300> big

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
attach the big petals but as for the big

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.840 
attach the big petals but as for the big
petals<00:03:22.930> just<00:03:23.260> give<00:03:23.530> it<00:03:23.650> a<00:03:23.740> small<00:03:24.100> little<00:03:24.430> pinch

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
petals just give it a small little pinch

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.940 
petals just give it a small little pinch
on<00:03:25.180> the<00:03:25.570> petals<00:03:25.959> to<00:03:26.200> give<00:03:26.380> it<00:03:26.530> a<00:03:26.680> more

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
on the petals to give it a more

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.390 
on the petals to give it a more
realistic<00:03:27.490> look<00:03:28.920> just<00:03:29.920> keep<00:03:30.130> on<00:03:30.250> adding

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
realistic look just keep on adding

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.580 
realistic look just keep on adding
petals<00:03:31.000> as<00:03:31.150> much<00:03:31.600> as<00:03:31.810> you<00:03:31.990> like

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.250 

so<00:03:36.370> as<00:03:36.849> you<00:03:36.970> can<00:03:37.090> see<00:03:37.300> the<00:03:37.540> more<00:03:37.750> petals<00:03:38.140> you

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
so as you can see the more petals you

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.410 
so as you can see the more petals you
put<00:03:38.470> on<00:03:38.620> the<00:03:38.890> more<00:03:39.130> prettier<00:03:39.730> and<00:03:40.120> more

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
put on the more prettier and more

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.880 
put on the more prettier and more
realistic<00:03:40.840> you<00:03:41.170> look<00:03:43.080> the<00:03:44.080> more<00:03:44.290> petals<00:03:44.739> you

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
realistic you look the more petals you

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.710 
realistic you look the more petals you
add<00:03:45.069> on<00:03:45.280> the<00:03:45.550> thicker<00:03:45.760> the<00:03:45.880> base<00:03:46.180> is<00:03:46.420> going<00:03:46.630> to

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
add on the thicker the base is going to

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.809 
add on the thicker the base is going to
be<00:03:46.780> but<00:03:47.380> don't<00:03:47.620> worry<00:03:47.800> about<00:03:47.950> that<00:03:48.250> now<00:03:48.489> we're

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:48.819 
be but don't worry about that now we're

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:54.960 
be but don't worry about that now we're
take<00:03:49.060> care<00:03:49.239> of<00:03:49.330> that<00:03:49.450> later

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.990 

take<00:03:55.960> a<00:03:55.990> pointy<00:03:56.410> object<00:03:57.070> um<00:03:57.190> I<00:03:57.700> guess

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
take a pointy object um I guess

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.730 
take a pointy object um I guess
toothpick<00:03:58.510> will<00:03:58.660> work<00:03:58.840> as<00:03:59.020> well<00:03:59.230> but<00:03:59.530> it's

00:03:59.730 --> 00:03:59.740 
toothpick will work as well but it's

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:02.310 
toothpick will work as well but it's
best<00:04:00.010> to<00:04:00.190> use<00:04:00.310> like<00:04:00.700> a<00:04:00.730> metal<00:04:01.150> bar<00:04:01.360> to<00:04:01.930> stick<00:04:02.200> it

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
best to use like a metal bar to stick it

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.700 
best to use like a metal bar to stick it
to<00:04:02.350> the<00:04:02.500> center<00:04:02.950> to<00:04:03.130> hold<00:04:03.340> it<00:04:03.520> in<00:04:03.670> place

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:04.710 
to the center to hold it in place

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:07.590 
to the center to hold it in place
Sita<00:04:05.710> does<00:04:05.890> plug<00:04:06.280> is<00:04:06.520> hollow<00:04:06.850> in<00:04:07.120> the<00:04:07.150> center

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
Sita does plug is hollow in the center

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.630 
Sita does plug is hollow in the center
so<00:04:07.840> be<00:04:08.050> sure<00:04:08.080> when<00:04:08.830> you<00:04:08.950> use<00:04:08.980> the<00:04:09.310> pointy

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
so be sure when you use the pointy

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.880 
so be sure when you use the pointy
objects<00:04:10.210> to<00:04:10.420> line<00:04:10.660> the<00:04:10.900> rows<00:04:11.110> to<00:04:11.470> the<00:04:11.500> center

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
objects to line the rows to the center

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.030 
objects to line the rows to the center
of<00:04:12.070> the<00:04:12.340> dust<00:04:12.580> plug<00:04:13.350> as<00:04:14.350> you<00:04:14.500> can<00:04:14.680> see<00:04:14.830> right
