it would be would it be interesting to

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.600 
it would be would it be interesting to

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
go back and see what it was like then

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.250 
go back and see what it was like then
compared<00:03:55.060> to<00:03:55.150> what<00:03:55.270> it's<00:03:55.420> like<00:03:55.600> now<00:03:55.870> I'm<00:03:55.990> sure

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260
