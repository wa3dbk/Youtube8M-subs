00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
although you would think that probably a

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.000 
although you would think that probably a
little<00:00:36.690> bit<00:00:36.870> more<00:00:37.020> impactful<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:37.590> basketball

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
little bit more impactful and basketball

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.310 
little bit more impactful and basketball
because<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.399> time<00:00:38.610> on<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.059> court<00:00:39.270> does<00:00:40.170> that

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
because the time on the court does that

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.590 
because the time on the court does that
play<00:00:40.559> into<00:00:40.590> this<00:00:41.040> you<00:00:41.879> know<00:00:42.000> what<00:00:42.180> would<00:00:42.360> I

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
play into this you know what would I

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.260 
play into this you know what would I
think<00:00:43.020> what<00:00:43.559> does<00:00:43.770> happen<00:00:44.040> between<00:00:44.309> all<00:00:44.940> three

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270

problems<00:01:09.390> I'm<00:01:09.510> having<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:10.049> so<00:01:10.650> we<00:01:11.070> started

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
problems I'm having and so we started

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.840 
problems I'm having and so we started
talking<00:01:11.880> about<00:01:12.290> cap<00:01:13.290> influences<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.549> how

decisions<00:01:17.009> I<00:01:17.159> think<00:01:17.729> analytically<00:01:18.210> all<00:01:18.810> three

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
decisions I think analytically all three

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.719 
decisions I think analytically all three
of<00:01:19.350> them<00:01:19.560> are<00:01:19.710> beginning<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.310> look<00:01:20.460> at<00:01:20.610> each

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
of them are beginning to look at each

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.640 
of them are beginning to look at each
other<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.180> each<00:01:21.750> each<00:01:22.200> of<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.530> other

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
other and each each of the other

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.649 
other and each each of the other
organizations<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.939> beginning<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.479> talk

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
organizations and beginning to talk

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.170 
organizations and beginning to talk
about<00:01:24.840> sharing<00:01:25.290> best<00:01:25.500> practices<00:01:26.000> look<00:01:27.000> when<00:01:27.150> i

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
about sharing best practices look when i
