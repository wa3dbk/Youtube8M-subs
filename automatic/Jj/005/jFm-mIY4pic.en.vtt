commentaries and as you can see i'm

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:18.980 
commentaries and as you can see i'm
getting<00:00:18.000> my<00:00:18.119> Stargate<00:00:18.570> and<00:00:18.690> then<00:00:18.810> in<00:00:18.900> my

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
getting my Stargate and then in my

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.179 
getting my Stargate and then in my
Citadel<00:00:19.260> you<00:00:19.650> have<00:00:19.740> to<00:00:19.800> get<00:00:19.920> those<00:00:20.039> at<00:00:20.160> the

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
Citadel you have to get those at the

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.560 
Citadel you have to get those at the
same<00:00:20.279> time<00:00:20.550> if<00:00:20.699> you<00:00:20.789> want<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:20.970> do<00:00:21.029> a<00:00:21.060> proper<00:00:21.270> sir

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
same time if you want to do a proper sir

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.870 
same time if you want to do a proper sir
dt<00:00:21.779> build<00:00:22.109> and<00:00:22.500> that's<00:00:22.980> what<00:00:23.100> I<00:00:23.160> mean<00:00:23.310> that's

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
dt build and that's what I mean that's

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.420 
dt build and that's what I mean that's
what<00:00:24.000> I'm<00:00:24.060> aiming<00:00:24.180> for<00:00:24.449> right<00:00:24.600> now<00:00:24.630> and<00:00:25.430> again

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
what I'm aiming for right now and again

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.769 
what I'm aiming for right now and again
the<00:00:26.550> Stargate<00:00:26.910> is<00:00:27.060> going<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:27.269> be<00:00:27.359> coming<00:00:27.599> up

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
the Stargate is going to be coming up

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.450 
the Stargate is going to be coming up
soon<00:00:27.840> although<00:00:28.380> I<00:00:28.710> know<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.250> timing

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
soon although I know the timing

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.229 
soon although I know the timing
basically<00:00:30.560> formulas<00:00:31.759> basically<00:00:32.759> one<00:00:32.969> middle

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
basically formulas basically one middle

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.990 
basically formulas basically one middle
nine<00:00:34.020> euless<00:00:34.380> era<00:00:34.620> when<00:00:35.100> or<00:00:35.340> they<00:00:35.880> are

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
nine euless era when or they are

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.729 
nine euless era when or they are
morphing<00:00:36.420> when<00:00:36.600> my<00:00:36.750> one<00:00:37.020> core<00:00:37.230> sorry<00:00:37.530> kisses

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
morphing when my one core sorry kisses

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.180 
morphing when my one core sorry kisses
base<00:00:38.090> so<00:00:39.090> that's<00:00:39.989> 43<00:00:40.320> hashmi<00:00:40.590> list<00:00:40.829> by<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.040> way

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
base so that's 43 hashmi list by the way

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.630 
base so that's 43 hashmi list by the way
and<00:00:41.460> so<00:00:42.649> I'm<00:00:43.649> getting<00:00:43.920> pylons<00:00:44.309> near<00:00:44.550> my

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
and so I'm getting pylons near my

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.069 
and so I'm getting pylons near my
mineral<00:00:44.820> lines<00:00:45.120> getting<00:00:45.510> prepared<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:45.989> make

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
mineral lines getting prepared to make

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.910 
mineral lines getting prepared to make
cannons<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:47.930> yeah<00:00:48.930> so<00:00:49.200> I'm<00:00:49.530> pretty<00:00:49.710> much

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
cannons and yeah so I'm pretty much

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.950 
cannons and yeah so I'm pretty much
getting<00:00:50.399> ready<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.730> make<00:00:50.820> ends<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.480> I'm

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
getting ready to make ends and I'm

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.869 
getting ready to make ends and I'm
pretty<00:00:52.710> safe<00:00:52.980> from<00:00:53.160> everything<00:00:53.309> right<00:00:53.760> now

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
pretty safe from everything right now

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.939 
pretty safe from everything right now
there's<00:00:54.210> nothing<00:00:54.329> really<00:00:54.660> that<00:00:54.780> can<00:00:55.050> kill<00:00:55.770> me

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
there's nothing really that can kill me

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.459 
there's nothing really that can kill me
like<00:00:56.100> really<00:00:56.250> badly<00:00:56.550> I<00:00:56.969> guess<00:00:57.449> 3<00:00:57.899> hatch<00:00:58.020> hydras

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
like really badly I guess 3 hatch hydras

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.599 
like really badly I guess 3 hatch hydras
could<00:00:59.160> break<00:00:59.460> me<00:00:59.699> although<00:01:00.320> I<00:01:01.320> really<00:01:02.309> helped

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
could break me although I really helped

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.130 
could break me although I really helped
highly<00:01:02.940> doubt<00:01:03.090> he's<00:01:03.239> doing<00:01:03.480> that<00:01:03.510> considering

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
highly doubt he's doing that considering

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.490 
highly doubt he's doing that considering
i've<00:01:04.260> seen<00:01:04.439> zerglings<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.159> I've<00:01:05.970> seen<00:01:06.500> him

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
i've seen zerglings and I've seen him

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.929 
i've seen zerglings and I've seen him
having<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:07.979> sunken<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.520> if<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:08.790> have<00:01:08.909> a

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
having the sunken and if you have a

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.700 
having the sunken and if you have a
sunken<00:01:09.330> you're<00:01:09.720> probably<00:01:10.200> not<00:01:10.409> going<00:01:10.530> for

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
sunken you're probably not going for

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.399 
sunken you're probably not going for
hydrolysed<00:01:11.189> considering<00:01:12.140> well<00:01:13.140> why<00:01:13.260> would

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
hydrolysed considering well why would

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.390 
hydrolysed considering well why would
you<00:01:13.530> need<00:01:13.590> or<00:01:13.740> some<00:01:13.860> can<00:01:14.010> we<00:01:14.040> have<00:01:14.159> higher

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
you need or some can we have higher

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.980 
you need or some can we have higher
risks<00:01:14.790> like<00:01:15.119> hydras<00:01:15.420> are<00:01:15.630> so<00:01:15.720> much<00:01:15.840> better

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
risks like hydras are so much better

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.890 
risks like hydras are so much better
than<00:01:16.140> investing<00:01:16.920> money<00:01:17.070> in<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.310> sunken<00:01:17.460> and

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
than investing money in the sunken and

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.149 
than investing money in the sunken and
now<00:01:18.900> again<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.439> got<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.650> read<00:01:19.799> this<00:01:19.950> stuff

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
now again you got to read this stuff

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.649 
now again you got to read this stuff
like<00:01:20.369> when<00:01:20.490> you're<00:01:20.610> playing<00:01:20.759> starcraft<00:01:21.270> like

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
like when you're playing starcraft like

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.109 
like when you're playing starcraft like
not<00:01:21.990> even<00:01:22.080> for<00:01:22.320> PVC<00:01:22.830> just<00:01:23.310> any<00:01:23.520> race<00:01:23.729> overall

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
not even for PVC just any race overall

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.460 
not even for PVC just any race overall
you<00:01:24.330> got<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.570> read<00:01:24.780> what<00:01:24.960> your<00:01:25.080> opponent's

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
you got to read what your opponent's

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.609 
you got to read what your opponent's
doing<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:26.600> you<00:01:27.600> got<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.840> get<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.049> game<00:01:28.200> timing

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
doing and you got to get the game timing

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.100 
doing and you got to get the game timing
like<00:01:29.009> proper<00:01:29.400> like<00:01:29.640> I<00:01:29.790> know<00:01:29.850> Mutis<00:01:30.630> argan

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
like proper like I know Mutis argan

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.600 
like proper like I know Mutis argan
three<00:01:31.350> he<00:01:31.619> has<00:01:31.680> three<00:01:31.950> actuate<00:01:32.340> so<00:01:32.520> the

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
three he has three actuate so the

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.340 
three he has three actuate so the
earliest<00:01:32.970> he<00:01:33.180> could<00:01:33.270> add<00:01:33.390> mutalisks<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:34.049> when

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
earliest he could add mutalisks is when

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.620 
earliest he could add mutalisks is when
my<00:01:34.530> coarser<00:01:35.100> reaches<00:01:35.400> his<00:01:35.549> base<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:36.000> that'll

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
my coarser reaches his base and that'll

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.170 
my coarser reaches his base and that'll
give<00:01:36.750> me<00:01:36.780> enough<00:01:36.869> time<00:01:37.079> to<00:01:37.259> make<00:01:37.470> cannons<00:01:37.860> and

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
give me enough time to make cannons and

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.370 
give me enough time to make cannons and
like<00:01:39.180> I<00:01:39.390> know<00:01:39.450> he's<00:01:39.689> not<00:01:39.810> going<00:01:39.869> hydralisk

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
like I know he's not going hydralisk

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.789 
like I know he's not going hydralisk
because<00:01:40.590> he<00:01:40.710> got<00:01:40.829> a<00:01:40.890> sunken<00:01:41.250> up<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:42.500> like<00:01:43.500> it

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
because he got a sunken up and like it

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.950 
because he got a sunken up and like it
it<00:01:44.100> all<00:01:44.280> works<00:01:44.700> out<00:01:44.880> like<00:01:45.149> pretty<00:01:45.390> much<00:01:45.479> if<00:01:45.810> you

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
it all works out like pretty much if you

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.840 
it all works out like pretty much if you
know<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.259> timing<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.740> now<00:01:47.250> I'm<00:01:47.340> scouting<00:01:47.579> I

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
know the timing and now I'm scouting I

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.520 
know the timing and now I'm scouting I
see<00:01:48.030> he<00:01:48.180> has<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.420> evolution<00:01:48.840> chamber<00:01:48.960> so<00:01:49.380> the

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
see he has to evolution chamber so the

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.460 
see he has to evolution chamber so the
one<00:01:49.740> thing<00:01:49.770> that<00:01:49.950> could<00:01:50.189> probably<00:01:50.369> mean<00:01:50.670> is

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
one thing that could probably mean is

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.539 
one thing that could probably mean is
he's<00:01:52.470> trying<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:52.770> set<00:01:52.890> up<00:01:52.979> for<00:01:53.159> a<00:01:53.189> late<00:01:53.369> game

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
he's trying to set up for a late game

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:54.980 
he's trying to set up for a late game
pretty<00:01:53.850> much<00:01:53.909> like<00:01:54.299> he<00:01:54.479> wants<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:54.750> get<00:01:54.840> early

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
pretty much like he wants to get early

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.959 
pretty much like he wants to get early
care<00:01:55.439> place<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:55.890> early<00:01:56.130> melee<00:01:56.340> weapons<00:01:56.729> so<00:01:56.880> he

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
care place and early melee weapons so he

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.240 
care place and early melee weapons so he
can<00:01:57.090> set<00:01:57.240> up<00:01:57.329> for<00:01:57.479> all<00:01:57.570> trailing<00:01:57.869> later<00:01:58.350> on<00:01:58.560> so

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
can set up for all trailing later on so

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.530 
can set up for all trailing later on so
now<00:01:59.430> I<00:01:59.460> know<00:01:59.579> he's<00:01:59.790> aiming<00:01:59.909> for<00:02:00.180> a<00:02:00.210> late<00:02:00.360> game

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
now I know he's aiming for a late game

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.940 
now I know he's aiming for a late game
although<00:02:00.869> now<00:02:01.079> I<00:02:01.110> also<00:02:01.320> know<00:02:01.619> he's<00:02:01.829> probably

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
although now I also know he's probably

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.340 
although now I also know he's probably
going<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.280> go<00:02:02.369> for<00:02:02.579> a<00:02:02.610> Hydra<00:02:02.909> sorry<00:02:03.420> zergling<00:02:03.899> /

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.130 
going to go for a Hydra sorry zergling /

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
lurker combo or a zergling / hydro combo

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.139 
lurker combo or a zergling / hydro combo
considering<00:02:07.680> he's<00:02:08.340> not<00:02:08.640> going<00:02:08.879> from<00:02:09.030> your

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
considering he's not going from your

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.120 
considering he's not going from your
risks<00:02:09.479> and

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
that when you have a quite like he's

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.510 
that when you have a quite like he's
invested<00:02:54.620> nothing<00:02:54.920> skirt<00:02:55.100> just<00:02:55.220> might<00:02:55.430> as

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
invested nothing skirt just might as

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.920 
invested nothing skirt just might as
well<00:02:55.640> spend<00:02:55.850> some<00:02:56.030> money<00:02:56.150> in<00:02:56.300> euless<00:02:56.630> to<00:02:56.780> kill

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
well spend some money in euless to kill

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.450 
well spend some money in euless to kill
the<00:02:57.020> coursers<00:02:57.410> because<00:02:58.100> they<00:02:58.220> can<00:02:58.340> actually

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:58.460 
the coursers because they can actually

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.000 
the coursers because they can actually
do<00:02:58.700> damage<00:02:58.970> later<00:02:59.090> on<00:02:59.300> but<00:02:59.830> he's<00:03:00.830> only

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
do damage later on but he's only

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.410 
do damage later on but he's only
investing<00:03:01.430> in<00:03:01.520> Scrooge's<00:03:01.880> so<00:03:02.060> I<00:03:02.090> know<00:03:02.210> he's

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
investing in Scrooge's so I know he's

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
investing in Scrooge's so I know he's
probably<00:03:02.600> gonna<00:03:02.780> provide<00:03:02.990> two<00:03:03.140> lists

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
probably gonna provide two lists

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.380 
probably gonna provide two lists
although<00:03:03.950> now<00:03:04.640> if<00:03:04.850> you<00:03:04.940> also<00:03:05.180> think<00:03:05.270> about

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
although now if you also think about

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.620 
although now if you also think about
this<00:03:06.400> basically<00:03:07.400> I'm<00:03:07.580> thinking<00:03:07.970> all<00:03:08.120> this<00:03:08.270> and

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
this basically I'm thinking all this and

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.290 
this basically I'm thinking all this and
at<00:03:08.900> a<00:03:09.020> higher<00:03:09.200> stock<00:03:09.650> a<00:03:09.770> flow<00:03:10.060> basically<00:03:11.060> if<00:03:11.180> I

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
at a higher stock a flow basically if I

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.080 
at a higher stock a flow basically if I
think<00:03:11.630> this<00:03:11.840> your<00:03:12.770> opponent<00:03:13.190> can<00:03:13.370> anticipate

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
think this your opponent can anticipate

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.540 
think this your opponent can anticipate
that<00:03:14.600> like<00:03:15.350> he<00:03:15.650> could<00:03:15.770> anticipate<00:03:16.070> that<00:03:16.400> I'm

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
that like he could anticipate that I'm

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.300 
that like he could anticipate that I'm
thinking<00:03:16.730> what<00:03:17.630> I'm<00:03:17.750> thinking<00:03:17.780> and<00:03:18.350> then

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
thinking what I'm thinking and then

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:20.830 
thinking what I'm thinking and then
he'll<00:03:19.520> probably<00:03:19.550> just<00:03:20.000> counter<00:03:20.540> it<00:03:20.630> by<00:03:20.690> doing

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
he'll probably just counter it by doing

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.710 
he'll probably just counter it by doing
what<00:03:21.230> I<00:03:21.260> think<00:03:21.350> he<00:03:21.650> won't<00:03:21.740> do<00:03:21.980> and<00:03:22.720> honestly

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
what I think he won't do and honestly

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.440 
what I think he won't do and honestly
that<00:03:24.230> me<00:03:24.950> saying<00:03:25.250> that<00:03:25.370> and<00:03:25.760> then<00:03:25.880> saying<00:03:26.270> it's

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
that me saying that and then saying it's

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.180 
that me saying that and then saying it's
to<00:03:26.840> sing<00:03:27.050> it<00:03:27.170> to<00:03:27.200> myself<00:03:27.380> in<00:03:27.620> my<00:03:27.710> head<00:03:27.890> it<00:03:28.040> made

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
to sing it to myself in my head it made

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.340 
to sing it to myself in my head it made
me<00:03:28.370> think<00:03:28.910> about<00:03:29.120> it<00:03:29.450> so<00:03:29.810> it's<00:03:29.930> really<00:03:30.080> hard<00:03:30.290> to

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
me think about it so it's really hard to

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.460 
me think about it so it's really hard to
understand<00:03:30.740> in<00:03:31.010> other<00:03:31.160> words<00:03:32.110> basically<00:03:33.110> what

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
understand in other words basically what

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.770 
understand in other words basically what
I<00:03:33.500> mean<00:03:33.710> is<00:03:33.860> you<00:03:34.010> can<00:03:34.160> like<00:03:34.520> if<00:03:35.360> you're<00:03:35.540> like

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
I mean is you can like if you're like

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.120 
I mean is you can like if you're like
I'll<00:03:36.080> give<00:03:36.260> an<00:03:36.350> example<00:03:36.410> by<00:03:36.860> the<00:03:36.920> way<00:03:37.010> he's

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
I'll give an example by the way he's

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.960 
I'll give an example by the way he's
trying<00:03:37.220> to<00:03:37.310> harass<00:03:37.460> me<00:03:37.610> with<00:03:37.730> me<00:03:37.820> do<00:03:37.910> this

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
trying to harass me with me do this

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:39.580 
trying to harass me with me do this
right<00:03:38.150> now<00:03:38.180> and<00:03:38.300> so<00:03:38.780> he<00:03:38.900> basically<00:03:39.020> did<00:03:39.440> do

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
right now and so he basically did do

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:40.870 
right now and so he basically did do
what<00:03:39.800> I<00:03:39.980> thought<00:03:40.400> he<00:03:40.550> wouldn't<00:03:40.760> do

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
what I thought he wouldn't do

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.820 
what I thought he wouldn't do
considering<00:03:41.510> he<00:03:41.630> had<00:03:41.720> square<00:03:41.959> jizz<00:03:42.110> I'll<00:03:42.680> give

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
considering he had square jizz I'll give

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.000 
considering he had square jizz I'll give
an<00:03:42.920> example<00:03:42.950> basically<00:03:43.700> if<00:03:43.910> someone<00:03:44.270> has

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
an example basically if someone has

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.100 
an example basically if someone has
three<00:03:46.010> hatcheries<00:03:46.459> and<00:03:46.660> then<00:03:47.660> he<00:03:47.870> gets<00:03:48.050> a

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
three hatcheries and then he gets a

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.310 
three hatcheries and then he gets a
really<00:03:48.410> early<00:03:48.500> hard<00:03:48.800> Williston<00:03:49.190> and<00:03:50.170> he<00:03:51.170> goes

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320 
really early hard Williston and he goes

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.530 
really early hard Williston and he goes
to<00:03:51.350> hydralisk<00:03:51.860> and<00:03:52.130> then<00:03:52.730> I'm<00:03:53.000> just<00:03:53.270> like<00:03:53.390> oh

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
to hydralisk and then I'm just like oh

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:54.820 
to hydralisk and then I'm just like oh
 i'm<00:03:53.810> gonna<00:03:53.959> he's<00:03:54.110> going<00:03:54.290> for<00:03:54.380> hydralisk

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 
 i'm gonna he's going for hydralisk

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:58.420 
 i'm gonna he's going for hydralisk
so<00:03:55.130> I'm<00:03:55.220> gonna<00:03:55.310> make<00:03:55.459> 500<00:03:56.000> cannons<00:03:56.300> and<00:03:57.160> then<00:03:58.160> I

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
so I'm gonna make 500 cannons and then I

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.460 
so I'm gonna make 500 cannons and then I
basically<00:03:58.820> get<00:03:59.360> 500<00:03:59.750> cannons<00:04:00.050> although<00:04:00.320> he

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
basically get 500 cannons although he

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.170 
basically get 500 cannons although he
anticipates<00:04:01.070> that<00:04:01.190> I'm<00:04:01.370> going<00:04:01.550> to<00:04:01.670> get<00:04:01.760> 500

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
anticipates that I'm going to get 500

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.560 
anticipates that I'm going to get 500
cannons<00:04:02.510> so<00:04:03.380> he<00:04:03.740> basically<00:04:04.120> only<00:04:05.120> makes<00:04:05.390> like

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:05.570 
cannons so he basically only makes like

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:09.040 
cannons so he basically only makes like
to<00:04:05.720> I<00:04:05.750> risks<00:04:06.260> and<00:04:06.640> then<00:04:07.640> I<00:04:07.910> have<00:04:08.480> invested<00:04:08.780> so

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.050 
to I risks and then I have invested so

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:10.630 
to I risks and then I have invested so
much<00:04:09.080> money<00:04:09.200> in<00:04:09.500> cannons<00:04:09.830> that's<00:04:10.220> pretty<00:04:10.400> much

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
much money in cannons that's pretty much

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.250 
much money in cannons that's pretty much
anticipating<00:04:11.480> which<00:04:11.600> your<00:04:11.750> opponent<00:04:11.780> is

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
anticipating which your opponent is

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.210 
anticipating which your opponent is
going<00:04:12.530> to<00:04:12.620> think<00:04:12.830> and<00:04:13.070> react<00:04:13.640> to<00:04:14.230> so<00:04:15.230> hopefully

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
going to think and react to so hopefully

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.289 
going to think and react to so hopefully
with<00:04:16.340> that<00:04:16.459> example<00:04:16.700> you<00:04:16.910> guys<00:04:17.030> kind<00:04:17.180> of

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
with that example you guys kind of

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.719 
with that example you guys kind of
understand<00:04:17.660> it<00:04:17.810> if<00:04:17.959> not<00:04:18.229> then<00:04:18.560> well<00:04:19.400> screw<00:04:19.580> you

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:19.729 
understand it if not then well screw you

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:20.860 
understand it if not then well screw you
because<00:04:19.970> I'm<00:04:20.180> not<00:04:20.299> going<00:04:20.419> to<00:04:20.479> bother<00:04:20.570> trying

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
because I'm not going to bother trying

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:21.970 
because I'm not going to bother trying
to<00:04:20.900> explain<00:04:20.960> it<00:04:21.290> because<00:04:21.350> it's<00:04:21.590> to<00:04:21.739> her

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:21.980 
to explain it because it's to her

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.220 
to explain it because it's to her
it's<00:04:22.820> not<00:04:22.910> even<00:04:23.120> that<00:04:23.240> big<00:04:23.330> a<00:04:23.450> deal<00:04:23.600> well<00:04:23.990> it

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:24.230 
it's not even that big a deal well it

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.440 
it's not even that big a deal well it
kind<00:04:24.410> of<00:04:24.440> is<00:04:24.560> but<00:04:24.620> not<00:04:24.950> really<00:04:25.160> um<00:04:26.060> anyways

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
kind of is but not really um anyways

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.240 
kind of is but not really um anyways
yeah<00:04:26.630> so<00:04:26.840> he<00:04:26.990> had<00:04:27.110> like<00:04:27.350> three<00:04:27.560> formulas<00:04:28.070> his

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
yeah so he had like three formulas his

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.110 
yeah so he had like three formulas his
thing<00:04:28.730> like<00:04:29.180> his<00:04:29.420> fake<00:04:30.410> like<00:04:31.160> I<00:04:31.460> don't<00:04:31.970> know

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
thing like his fake like I don't know

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.510 
thing like his fake like I don't know
what<00:04:32.240> you<00:04:32.300> call<00:04:32.330> it<00:04:32.480> he<00:04:33.200> tried<00:04:33.440> to<00:04:33.470> make<00:04:33.890> me<00:04:33.950> get

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
what you call it he tried to make me get

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.160 
what you call it he tried to make me get
fooled<00:04:34.790> into<00:04:35.000> thinking<00:04:35.120> he<00:04:35.630> won't<00:04:35.750> do<00:04:35.930> what<00:04:36.050> he

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:36.170 
fooled into thinking he won't do what he

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:39.160 
fooled into thinking he won't do what he
did<00:04:36.380> but<00:04:37.160> like<00:04:37.700> it<00:04:37.910> failed<00:04:38.210> because<00:04:38.360> I<00:04:38.870> had<00:04:39.020> in

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:39.170 
did but like it failed because I had in

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:40.750 
did but like it failed because I had in
my<00:04:39.260> arcano<00:04:39.620> and<00:04:39.920> I<00:04:40.070> had<00:04:40.190> my<00:04:40.340> drug<00:04:40.520> goons

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
my arcano and I had my drug goons

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.240 
my arcano and I had my drug goons
headquarters<00:04:41.300> out<00:04:41.480> so<00:04:41.720> his<00:04:42.320> muralists<00:04:42.980> were

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
headquarters out so his muralists were

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.360 
headquarters out so his muralists were
like<00:04:43.580> they<00:04:44.030> didn't<00:04:44.210> do<00:04:44.270> any<00:04:44.420> damage<00:04:44.600> and<00:04:45.370> like

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
like they didn't do any damage and like

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:47.980 
like they didn't do any damage and like
I<00:04:46.550> technically<00:04:47.150> wasn't<00:04:47.330> going<00:04:47.630> to<00:04:47.690> get<00:04:47.780> kenz

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
I technically wasn't going to get kenz

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.420 
I technically wasn't going to get kenz
at<00:04:48.200> my<00:04:48.260> main<00:04:48.440> until<00:04:48.770> I<00:04:48.860> actually<00:04:48.980> saw<00:04:49.310> those

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
at my main until I actually saw those

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:50.950 
at my main until I actually saw those

take out this expansion right now and

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:37.570 
take out this expansion right now and
while<00:05:36.200> again<00:05:36.590> another<00:05:36.980> key<00:05:37.220> thing<00:05:37.250> I'm<00:05:37.550> doing

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580

while again another key thing I'm doing
right<00:05:37.820> here<00:05:37.880> I'm<00:05:38.360> expanding<00:05:38.840> while<00:05:39.170> putting

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.440 
right here I'm expanding while putting

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.950 
right here I'm expanding while putting
pressure<00:05:39.710> so<00:05:40.160> like<00:05:40.820> I<00:05:41.090> can't<00:05:41.570> stress<00:05:41.930> how

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 
pressure so like I can't stress how

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.560 
pressure so like I can't stress how
important<00:05:42.620> enough<00:05:42.950> that<00:05:43.130> is<00:05:43.430> like<00:05:43.730> you<00:05:44.330> can't

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:44.570 
important enough that is like you can't

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:47.110 
important enough that is like you can't
just<00:05:44.780> expand<00:05:45.500> a<00:05:45.800> hoping<00:05:46.400> your<00:05:46.610> opponent<00:05:47.030> won't

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 
just expand a hoping your opponent won't

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.840 
just expand a hoping your opponent won't
see<00:05:47.360> it<00:05:47.480> that<00:05:47.690> is<00:05:48.320> pretty<00:05:48.650> newbie<00:05:49.040> and<00:05:49.250> if<00:05:49.700> you

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:49.850 
see it that is pretty newbie and if you

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:51.250 
see it that is pretty newbie and if you
expand<00:05:50.180> just<00:05:50.390> hoping<00:05:50.720> your<00:05:50.870> opponent<00:05:51.200> won't

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:51.260 
expand just hoping your opponent won't

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260 
expand just hoping your opponent won't
see<00:05:51.470> it<00:05:51.560> then<00:05:51.860> well<00:05:52.670> I<00:05:52.700> guess<00:05:52.910> you<00:05:53.030> could<00:05:53.060> get

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:53.270 
see it then well I guess you could get

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:54.460 
see it then well I guess you could get
away<00:05:53.360> with<00:05:53.450> your<00:05:53.690> point<00:05:53.900> not<00:05:54.080> seeing<00:05:54.320> it

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:54.470 
away with your point not seeing it

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.920 
away with your point not seeing it
although<00:05:54.770> like<00:05:55.430> and<00:05:55.760> yet<00:05:56.000> anyone<00:05:56.540> that's<00:05:56.690> like

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:56.930 
although like and yet anyone that's like

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.140 
although like and yet anyone that's like
c-<00:05:57.830> or<00:05:57.980> higher<00:05:58.160> and<00:05:58.250> I<00:05:58.430> see<00:05:58.580> cup<00:05:58.760> is<00:05:58.940> gonna

00:05:59.140 --> 00:05:59.150 
c- or higher and I see cup is gonna

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:00.790 
c- or higher and I see cup is gonna
definitely<00:05:59.420> scalp<00:05:59.840> expansions<00:06:00.440> and<00:06:00.650> they're

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:00.800 
definitely scalp expansions and they're

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.240 
definitely scalp expansions and they're
going<00:06:00.890> to<00:06:00.950> definitely<00:06:01.130> see<00:06:01.490> that<00:06:01.520> um<00:06:02.650> like<00:06:03.650> you
