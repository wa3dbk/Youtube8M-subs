00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.100
 What do you mean 'I shouldn't take Sint Maarten too seriously'? 

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:07.580
 When you stand in front of the doors of these people, the person who opens that door is everything that matters. 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.500
 Your audience and your goal is to deliver them the evening of their lives. 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.400
 You don't want to disappoint them, do you? 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.000
 Do you sometimes want to risk the chance of getting an apple? -Never! 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.360
 That's the spirit. Time to ring the bell. 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.160
 Hey? 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.620
 Hey baby, you know I love you. 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.320
 But today is November 11. 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.780
 Bitch. 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.460

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.660
 What kind of balzakkerij is this? Do you see that we are busy? 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.000
 Stop the music! 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.520
 I hope you are proud of yourself, because you have just ruined the total show! 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.880
 And that while we were only at the first number! 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.800
 It's all right, take some candy. -No. 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.880
 I have disappointed you and myself. 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.140
 But to be honest, I knew this was coming. 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.540
 I was kidding myself. 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.040
 Year after year I tried to surpass myself. 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.680
 Knowing that I couldn't keep up with this. 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.520
 Perhaps the time has come to make room for others. 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.560
 The new generation, the young ones, the future. 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.080
 And once again the rugged Rock-and-Roll lifestyle claims precious lives. 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.920
 They knew the risks when they started this. 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.000
 Do you still want to do the next house? 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.540
 No, it probably only costs us a few baskets to catch those pigeons. 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:11.880
