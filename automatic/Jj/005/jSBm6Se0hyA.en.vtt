 Y 

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:19.700
 Our multifunctional machine 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.230
 empanadas gm was developed using 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.580
 the same technology implemented in 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.980
 Our other equipment models for 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.660
 the food industry has a 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.550
 Robust chassis with coating 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.619
 nickel and chrome which makes it 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.570
 resistant to corrosion generated by 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.510
 a high humidity environment typical of 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.680
 a food factory or restaurant 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.740
 complying with the technical standards of 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:42.500
 invima and the de fedea de usa for the 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:45.020
 food processing cycle 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.120
 work of the m2 starts when it 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.980
 introduce the dough of the empanada in the 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.020
 left chamber to be pre formed 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.449
 to the desired thickness and then be 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.070
 transported by sliding to the 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:56.660
 filling and closing chamber for 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.359
 complete the production cycle of the 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.920
 empanada or arepa the system 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:03.230
 drive consists of a subtle 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.879
 stainless joystick which 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.220
 requires less than one newton of force 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.630
 to be activated by eliminating itself by 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.550
 complete health problems 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.950
 occupational related to 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.450
 manufacture of these foods such 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.270
 like carpal tunnel syndrome 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.830
 radiculopathy shoulder problems and 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.600
 back among others 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.880
 giving its operators a use 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.640
 for your health and constant performance 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.159
 in the preparation of the food of the 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.900
 same way the same will allow 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:31.909
 increase the productivity of your company

 making the most of your time 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.409
 workers and substantively improving 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.119
 the quality of their products what is 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.100
 translates into a notable reduction in 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:43.490
 production and utilization costs 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.860
 of the inputs with the gm duo can 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.960
 make up to 550 units per hour with 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.450
 two operators although it can also be 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.890
 operated by one all of our 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.590
 equipment have the best technology 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.319
 available worldwide we use 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.729

 Americans to elaborate our 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:03.259
 machines as well as the best steels 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.149
 stainless steel available in the market and 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:06.350
 rigorous quality controls the 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:08.720
