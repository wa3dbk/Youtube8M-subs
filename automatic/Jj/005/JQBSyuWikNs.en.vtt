00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280

version<00:02:33.640> of<00:02:33.730> them<00:02:33.850> as<00:02:33.940> well<00:02:34.120> I<00:02:34.300> may<00:02:34.720> be<00:02:34.750> wrong

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
version of them as well I may be wrong

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.440 
version of them as well I may be wrong
so<00:02:36.100> it<00:02:36.400> is<00:02:36.520> quite<00:02:36.760> like<00:02:36.910> Scotland<00:02:37.120> we<00:02:37.330> do
