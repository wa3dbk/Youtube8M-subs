00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.979 
question at hand now you may be like
dude<00:00:32.130> what<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.640> f<00:00:32.790> are<00:00:33.120> you<00:00:33.180> saying<00:00:33.600> there's

dude what the f are you saying there's

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.380 
dude what the f are you saying there's
no<00:00:34.140> way<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.559> campaign<00:00:35.040> is<00:00:35.280> gonna<00:00:35.489> be<00:00:35.700> anything

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
no way the campaign is gonna be anything

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.780 
no way the campaign is gonna be anything
like<00:00:36.870> related<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.680> zombies<00:00:38.129> there's<00:00:38.370> no<00:00:38.520> way

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
like related to zombies there's no way

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.810 
like related to zombies there's no way
no<00:00:39.090> way<00:00:39.350> well<00:00:40.350> i<00:00:40.710> think<00:00:40.920> that<00:00:41.309> there<00:00:41.460> could<00:00:41.790> be

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
no way well i think that there could be

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.500 
no way well i think that there could be
this<00:00:42.090> possibility<00:00:42.960> because<00:00:43.530> you<00:00:44.250> know<00:00:44.370> in<00:00:44.640> XO

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
this possibility because you know in XO

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.150 
this possibility because you know in XO
zones<00:00:45.750> we<00:00:45.989> got<00:00:46.170> EXO<00:00:46.590> zombies<00:00:46.620> after

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
zones we got EXO zombies after

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.830 
zones we got EXO zombies after
completing<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.850> campaign<00:00:48.300> now<00:00:48.510> and

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
completing the campaign now and

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.860 
completing the campaign now and
generally<00:00:49.649> like<00:00:49.969> when<00:00:50.969> we<00:00:51.090> complete<00:00:51.390> campaign

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
generally like when we complete campaign

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.540 
generally like when we complete campaign
the<00:00:51.989> world<00:00:52.170> of<00:00:52.289> war<00:00:52.410> we<00:00:52.590> got<00:00:52.739> nazi<00:00:53.129> zombies<00:00:53.430> we

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
the world of war we got nazi zombies we

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.750 
the world of war we got nazi zombies we
got<00:00:53.699> not<00:00:54.110> completed<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.199> in<00:00:55.350> black<00:00:55.800> ops<00:00:56.070> we<00:00:56.489> got

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
got not completed it in black ops we got

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.180 
got not completed it in black ops we got
five<00:00:57.660> so<00:00:58.260> i<00:00:58.289> definitely<00:00:58.680> think<00:00:58.949> there's<00:00:59.129> gonna

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
five so i definitely think there's gonna

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.160 
five so i definitely think there's gonna
be<00:00:59.399> something<00:00:59.760> to<00:01:00.270> do<00:01:00.390> with<00:01:00.510> zombies<00:01:00.899> at<00:01:01.050> the

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
be something to do with zombies at the

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.889 
be something to do with zombies at the
end<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.649> this<00:01:01.890> campaign<00:01:02.520> but<00:01:03.239> i<00:01:03.480> think<00:01:03.600> there's

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
end of this campaign but i think there's

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.200 
end of this campaign but i think there's
more<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.350> it<00:01:04.379> one<00:01:05.309> such<00:01:05.610> theory<00:01:05.909> that<00:01:06.150> I

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
more to it one such theory that I

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.780 
more to it one such theory that I
thought<00:01:06.600> of<00:01:06.659> is<00:01:07.080> perhaps<00:01:07.380> perhaps<00:01:08.159> at<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.490> end

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
thought of is perhaps perhaps at the end

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.660 
thought of is perhaps perhaps at the end
of<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.450> black<00:01:09.720> ops<00:01:09.990> 3<00:01:10.490> storyline<00:01:11.490> the

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
of the black ops 3 storyline the

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.359 
of the black ops 3 storyline the
campaign<00:01:12.270> is<00:01:12.510> similar<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:12.960> EXO<00:01:13.320> zombies<00:01:13.369> we

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
campaign is similar to EXO zombies we

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.850 
campaign is similar to EXO zombies we
find<00:01:14.640> out<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:14.850> there<00:01:15.720> is<00:01:15.930> some<00:01:16.200> sort<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.650> like

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
find out that there is some sort of like

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.490 
find out that there is some sort of like
supernatural<00:01:17.400> element<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.750> that<00:01:18.780> could<00:01:19.320> only

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
supernatural element and that could only

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.920 
supernatural element and that could only
real<00:01:20.130> are<00:01:20.369> that<00:01:20.700> could<00:01:20.909> lead<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.420> zombies

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
real are that could lead to zombies

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.679 
real are that could lead to zombies
excuse<00:01:22.470> me<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:23.580> supernatural<00:01:24.090> element

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
excuse me that supernatural element

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.570 
excuse me that supernatural element
could<00:01:24.869> be<00:01:25.020> like<00:01:25.200> you<00:01:25.710> know<00:01:25.740> something<00:01:26.250> with

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
could be like you know something with

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.940 
could be like you know something with
shadows<00:01:27.119> of<00:01:27.299> evil<00:01:27.420> perhaps<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.380> don't<00:01:28.530> think<00:01:28.740> so

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
shadows of evil perhaps I don't think so

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.060 
shadows of evil perhaps I don't think so
maybe<00:01:29.729> we<00:01:30.000> maybe<00:01:30.960> it's<00:01:31.170> either<00:01:31.320> in<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.740> future

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
maybe we maybe it's either in the future

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.800 
maybe we maybe it's either in the future
which<00:01:32.700> I<00:01:32.820> don't<00:01:32.880> think<00:01:33.090> so<00:01:33.360> unless<00:01:33.540> we're

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
which I don't think so unless we're

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.749 
which I don't think so unless we're
getting<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.079> third<00:01:34.290> map<00:01:34.500> like<00:01:34.829> you<00:01:35.130> know<00:01:35.250> it's

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
getting a third map like you know it's

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.780 
getting a third map like you know it's
and<00:01:35.970> we're<00:01:36.090> not<00:01:36.180> gonna<00:01:36.270> go<00:01:36.450> stay<00:01:36.930> in<00:01:37.009> 2065<00:01:38.009> so

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
and we're not gonna go stay in 2065 so

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.950 
and we're not gonna go stay in 2065 so
perhaps<00:01:39.270> we<00:01:40.079> have<00:01:40.320> like<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.530> flashback<00:01:41.040> to

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
perhaps we have like a flashback to

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.660 
perhaps we have like a flashback to
shadows<00:01:42.960> of<00:01:43.140> evil<00:01:43.259> you<00:01:43.770> know<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:43.950> flashback

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
shadows of evil you know a flashback

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.999 
shadows of evil you know a flashback
back<00:01:44.970> in<00:01:45.149> time<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.689> explore<00:01:46.170> this<00:01:46.380> map<00:01:46.710> or

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
back in time to explore this map or

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.039 
back in time to explore this map or
something<00:01:47.280> along<00:01:47.640> those<00:01:48.000> lines<00:01:48.149> now<00:01:48.869> whether

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
something along those lines now whether

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.960 
something along those lines now whether
it's<00:01:49.320> something<00:01:49.530> that<00:01:49.860> straightforward<00:01:50.280> and

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
it's something that straightforward and

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.179 
it's something that straightforward and
that<00:01:51.210> concrete<00:01:51.750> relationship<00:01:52.710> I<00:01:52.829> don't<00:01:53.070> know

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
that concrete relationship I don't know

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.490 
that concrete relationship I don't know
I<00:01:53.369> think<00:01:53.700> it<00:01:53.790> might<00:01:54.030> be<00:01:54.060> more<00:01:54.659> subtle<00:01:55.079> you<00:01:55.380> know

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
I think it might be more subtle you know

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.950 
I think it might be more subtle you know
subtle<00:01:56.130> easter<00:01:56.579> eggs<00:01:56.759> relating<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:57.840> the

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.560 
zombies storyline perhaps hit an audio

we're going to be experiencing and

maybe even

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.000 
maybe even
their<00:02:09.060> map<00:02:09.210> who<00:02:09.420> knows<00:02:09.660> but<00:02:10.410> you<00:02:10.890> know<00:02:10.980> I

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.010 
their map who knows but you know I

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:13.250 
their map who knows but you know I
definitely<00:02:11.490> think<00:02:11.820> that<00:02:11.940> this<00:02:12.360> campaign<00:02:13.230> is

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
definitely think that this campaign is

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.140 
definitely think that this campaign is
going<00:02:13.560> to<00:02:13.650> have<00:02:13.800> some<00:02:14.040> secrets<00:02:14.220> that<00:02:14.910> we're

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
going to have some secrets that we're

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.270 
going to have some secrets that we're
going<00:02:15.330> to<00:02:15.390> need<00:02:15.540> to<00:02:15.720> find<00:02:16.020> or<00:02:16.560> just<00:02:17.010> we're

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
going to need to find or just we're

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.680 
going to need to find or just we're
gonna<00:02:17.400> have<00:02:17.550> to<00:02:17.670> beat<00:02:17.850> the<00:02:17.970> campaign<00:02:18.180> to

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
gonna have to beat the campaign to

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.300 
gonna have to beat the campaign to
unlock<00:02:19.050> some<00:02:19.320> secrets<00:02:19.740> I<00:02:19.920> think<00:02:20.160> that's

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
unlock some secrets I think that's

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.670 
unlock some secrets I think that's
definitely<00:02:20.820> a<00:02:21.180> possibility<00:02:21.360> and<00:02:22.020> I'm<00:02:22.140> yawn
