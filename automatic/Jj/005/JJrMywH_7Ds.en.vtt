00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:49.080 
that all the races yeah that makes it

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.220 
that all the races yeah that makes it
really<00:00:49.530> difficult<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:50.520> yeah<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.630> climbs<00:00:51.930> are

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
really difficult and yeah the climbs are

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.319 
really difficult and yeah the climbs are
actually<00:00:52.860> not<00:00:53.100> so<00:00:53.340> bad<00:00:53.579> in<00:00:53.790> the<00:00:53.910> end<00:00:54.059> and

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
actually not so bad in the end and

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.450 
actually not so bad in the end and
they're<00:00:54.660> not<00:00:54.840> so<00:00:55.050> hard<00:00:55.290> but<00:00:56.040> when<00:00:56.190> you<00:00:56.280> make

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
they're not so hard but when you make

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.560 
they're not so hard but when you make
the<00:00:56.610> climbs<00:00:56.910> after<00:00:57.420> 250<00:00:58.140> case<00:00:58.379> then<00:00:59.270> you<00:01:00.270> start

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
the climbs after 250 case then you start

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.600 
the climbs after 250 case then you start
on<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.809> completely<00:01:01.320> different<00:01:01.469> level<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.340> then

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.610 
on a completely different level and then

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.109 
on a completely different level and then
then<00:01:02.879> it's<00:01:03.420> going<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.719> be<00:01:03.840> hurt<00:01:04.050> it's<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.680> long

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
then it's going to be hurt it's a long

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:07.670 
then it's going to be hurt it's a long
longest<00:01:06.119> race<00:01:06.360> or<00:01:06.660> one<00:01:06.840> of<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.050> longest<00:01:07.380> races

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
one of the nicest races in the season

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.210 
one of the nicest races in the season
and<00:01:37.070> yeah<00:01:38.070> we<00:01:38.280> saw<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.520> PACU<00:01:38.909> already<00:01:39.210> so<00:01:40.220> it

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
and yeah we saw the PACU already so it

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.020
