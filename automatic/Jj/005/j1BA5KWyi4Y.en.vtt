the<00:04:28.220> reason<00:04:28.970> why<00:04:29.090> you<00:04:29.150> want<00:04:29.389> to<00:04:29.479> do<00:04:29.570> this

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
the reason why you want to do this

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.260 
the reason why you want to do this
slowly<00:04:30.110> in<00:04:30.320> parts<00:04:30.770> is<00:04:30.889> because<00:04:31.370> if<00:04:31.610> you<00:04:32.000> add<00:04:32.150> it

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
slowly in parts is because if you add it

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.270 
slowly in parts is because if you add it
in<00:04:32.389> all<00:04:32.659> your<00:04:32.870> flour<00:04:33.110> together<00:04:33.530> at<00:04:33.740> once<00:04:33.979> and

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
in all your flour together at once and

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.820 
in all your flour together at once and
just<00:04:34.759> beat<00:04:35.060> that<00:04:35.090> it's<00:04:35.900> gonna<00:04:36.050> puff<00:04:36.380> up<00:04:36.590> and<00:04:36.740> go

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
just beat that it's gonna puff up and go

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.350 
just beat that it's gonna puff up and go
all<00:04:37.009> over<00:04:37.220> the<00:04:37.310> place<00:04:37.520> and<00:04:37.820> create<00:04:38.210> an

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
all over the place and create an

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.990 
all over the place and create an
unnecessary<00:04:39.349> mess<00:04:39.590> so<00:04:40.159> you<00:04:40.220> just<00:04:40.610> do<00:04:40.789> that

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
unnecessary mess so you just do that

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.749 
unnecessary mess so you just do that
start<00:04:41.449> slow<00:04:41.780> and<00:04:41.810> slowly<00:04:42.380> walk<00:04:42.770> on<00:04:42.979> high<00:04:43.190> until

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:43.759 
start slow and slowly walk on high until

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:46.749 
start slow and slowly walk on high until
everything<00:04:44.300> is<00:04:44.389> nice<00:04:44.659> and<00:04:44.690> combined<00:04:45.380> and<00:04:45.759> once

00:04:46.749 --> 00:04:46.759 
everything is nice and combined and once

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:47.830 
everything is nice and combined and once
you're<00:04:46.909> done<00:04:47.030> with<00:04:47.180> that<00:04:47.240> you<00:04:47.630> should<00:04:47.659> have

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
you're done with that you should have

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.409

sugar<00:05:46.550> you<00:05:47.150> may<00:05:47.300> know<00:05:47.449> this<00:05:47.630> as<00:05:47.690> powdered<00:05:48.290> or

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:48.440 
sugar you may know this as powdered or

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.159 
sugar you may know this as powdered or
confectioner<00:05:49.070> sugar<00:05:49.180> now<00:05:50.180> don't<00:05:50.570> skip<00:05:50.960> this

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:51.169 
confectioner sugar now don't skip this

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:53.500 
confectioner sugar now don't skip this
step<00:05:51.410> of<00:05:51.650> sifting<00:05:52.130> your<00:05:52.310> icing<00:05:52.760> sugar<00:05:52.940> because

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:53.510 
step of sifting your icing sugar because

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:55.840 
step of sifting your icing sugar because
icing<00:05:54.199> sugar<00:05:54.350> has<00:05:54.650> a<00:05:54.680> real<00:05:55.010> tendency<00:05:55.460> to

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:55.850 
icing sugar has a real tendency to

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:58.300 
icing sugar has a real tendency to
always<00:05:55.880> comp<00:05:56.479> up<00:05:56.690> so<00:05:57.290> by<00:05:57.560> sifting<00:05:57.860> it<00:05:58.160> you're

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:58.310 
always comp up so by sifting it you're

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:00.100 
always comp up so by sifting it you're
going<00:05:58.430> to<00:05:58.520> prevent<00:05:58.940> your<00:05:59.180> frosting<00:05:59.479> later<00:05:59.900> on

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:00.110 
going to prevent your frosting later on

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:03.120 
going to prevent your frosting later on
from<00:06:00.470> having<00:06:00.740> chunks<00:06:01.130> of<00:06:01.250> icing<00:06:02.090> sugar<00:06:02.120> inside

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:03.130 
from having chunks of icing sugar inside

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:06.010 
from having chunks of icing sugar inside
so<00:06:04.130> on<00:06:04.310> to<00:06:04.430> do<00:06:04.550> that<00:06:04.580> you<00:06:04.910> just<00:06:05.090> add<00:06:05.240> in<00:06:05.600> half<00:06:05.900> a

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:06.020 
so on to do that you just add in half a

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.590 
so on to do that you just add in half a
cup<00:06:06.050> of<00:06:06.350> softened<00:06:07.010> unsalted<00:06:07.220> butter<00:06:07.729> you

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:08.600 
cup of softened unsalted butter you

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:09.879 
cup of softened unsalted butter you
really<00:06:08.840> want<00:06:09.020> to<00:06:09.080> make<00:06:09.229> sure<00:06:09.260> that<00:06:09.680> your

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:09.889 
really want to make sure that your

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:11.439 
really want to make sure that your
butter<00:06:10.040> is<00:06:10.250> soft<00:06:10.490> enough<00:06:10.729> because<00:06:11.120> I'll<00:06:11.300> make

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:11.449 
butter is soft enough because I'll make

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:14.020 
butter is soft enough because I'll make
this<00:06:11.570> process<00:06:12.020> so<00:06:12.260> much<00:06:12.500> easier<00:06:13.100> so<00:06:13.790> just

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:14.030 
this process so much easier so just

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:16.390 
this process so much easier so just
start<00:06:14.270> beating<00:06:14.750> it<00:06:14.840> on<00:06:15.020> slow<00:06:15.470> until<00:06:15.979> you<00:06:16.040> see

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:16.400 
start beating it on slow until you see

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.760 
start beating it on slow until you see
your<00:06:16.580> butter<00:06:16.880> and<00:06:17.150> sugar<00:06:17.450> mixture<00:06:17.900> kind<00:06:18.590> of

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:18.770 
your butter and sugar mixture kind of

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:20.710 
your butter and sugar mixture kind of
coming<00:06:19.190> together<00:06:19.340> before<00:06:20.000> switching<00:06:20.419> it<00:06:20.540> and

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:20.720 
coming together before switching it and

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.900 
coming together before switching it and
beating<00:06:21.169> it<00:06:21.260> on<00:06:21.440> high<00:06:21.710> for<00:06:22.340> about<00:06:22.550> three<00:06:22.790> to

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:22.910 
beating it on high for about three to

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:25.000 
beating it on high for about three to
five<00:06:23.120> minutes<00:06:23.510> until<00:06:23.720> everything<00:06:24.050> is<00:06:24.620> nice

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:25.010
