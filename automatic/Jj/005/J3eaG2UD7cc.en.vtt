00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:32.350 
all over again okay so honestly this is

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.230 
all over again okay so honestly this is
probably<00:05:32.380> one<00:05:32.740> of<00:05:32.770> my<00:05:32.950> favorites<00:05:33.340> I<00:05:33.820> think

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.240 
probably one of my favorites I think

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.180 
probably one of my favorites I think
it's<00:05:34.360> got<00:05:34.510> a<00:05:34.540> lot<00:05:34.780> of<00:05:34.810> uses<00:05:35.230> again<00:05:35.590> for<00:05:35.950> if

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.190 
it's got a lot of uses again for if

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:37.590 
it's got a lot of uses again for if
you're<00:05:36.610> printing<00:05:36.850> you<00:05:37.150> want<00:05:37.300> to<00:05:37.360> put<00:05:37.510> this

you're printing you want to put this

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.960 
you're printing you want to put this
onto<00:05:37.930> the<00:05:38.050> refrigerator<00:05:38.830> you<00:05:39.460> can<00:05:39.640> use<00:05:39.730> it<00:05:39.850> for

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:39.970 
onto the refrigerator you can use it for

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:41.760 
onto the refrigerator you can use it for
clients<00:05:40.480> you<00:05:40.720> could<00:05:40.870> set<00:05:41.110> it<00:05:41.140> as<00:05:41.320> a<00:05:41.350> desktop

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:41.770 
clients you could set it as a desktop

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:43.320 
clients you could set it as a desktop
background<00:05:42.370> if<00:05:42.490> you<00:05:42.520> printed<00:05:42.910> it<00:05:43.030> out<00:05:43.120> as<00:05:43.300> a

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:43.330 
background if you printed it out as a

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.750 
background if you printed it out as a
JPEG<00:05:43.780> the<00:05:44.200> sky<00:05:44.440> really<00:05:44.680> is<00:05:44.830> is<00:05:45.220> the<00:05:45.250> limit<00:05:45.670> with

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:48.390 
something like this okay you could even

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.370 
something like this okay you could even
you<00:05:49.390> know<00:05:49.450> and<00:05:49.630> I<00:05:49.690> kind<00:05:49.900> of<00:05:49.930> just<00:05:50.110> thought<00:05:50.200> of

I<00:06:17.380> I<00:06:17.470> honestly<00:06:18.250> just<00:06:18.460> thought<00:06:18.610> of<00:06:18.730> that<00:06:18.760> as

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:19.000 
I I honestly just thought of that as

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.180 
I I honestly just thought of that as
those<00:06:19.150> closing<00:06:19.570> this<00:06:19.690> up<00:06:19.870> so<00:06:20.020> I'll<00:06:20.320> stop<00:06:20.650> now<00:06:20.680> I

hope you guys enjoyed this week lots of
fun<00:06:22.960> I<00:06:22.990> think<00:06:23.140> it's<00:06:23.350> cool<00:06:23.560> to<00:06:23.590> see<00:06:23.920> some<00:06:24.220> of<00:06:24.400> the

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:24.850 
fun I think it's cool to see some of the

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:26.640 
fun I think it's cool to see some of the
creative<00:06:25.390> ideas<00:06:25.480> in<00:06:25.930> Lightroom<00:06:26.320> where<00:06:26.500> we

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:26.650 
creative ideas in Lightroom where we

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:29.280 
creative ideas in Lightroom where we
think<00:06:26.860> of<00:06:26.950> it<00:06:27.040> as<00:06:27.160> just<00:06:27.190> photography<00:06:27.820> but<00:06:28.420> you

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:29.290 
think of it as just photography but you

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:30.840 
think of it as just photography but you
can<00:06:29.500> do<00:06:29.680> some<00:06:29.890> pretty<00:06:30.070> creative<00:06:30.400> things<00:06:30.700> that

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:30.850 
can do some pretty creative things that

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:32.430 
can do some pretty creative things that
I<00:06:30.970> think<00:06:31.210> people<00:06:31.480> wouldn't<00:06:31.930> think<00:06:32.140> came<00:06:32.410> out

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:32.440 
I think people wouldn't think came out

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.830 
I think people wouldn't think came out
of<00:06:32.800> Lightroom<00:06:33.010> and<00:06:33.390> honestly<00:06:34.390> I<00:06:34.510> think<00:06:34.540> it's

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:34.840 
of Lightroom and honestly I think it's

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.840 
of Lightroom and honestly I think it's
easier<00:06:35.260> than<00:06:35.920> doing<00:06:36.040> it<00:06:36.220> in<00:06:36.310> Photoshop<00:06:36.730> cuz

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:36.850 
easier than doing it in Photoshop cuz

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:38.310 
easier than doing it in Photoshop cuz
you<00:06:36.910> don't<00:06:36.970> have<00:06:37.120> to<00:06:37.240> mess<00:06:37.420> with<00:06:37.450> layers<00:06:37.930> and

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:38.320 
you don't have to mess with layers and

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.570 
you don't have to mess with layers and
masks<00:06:38.800> and<00:06:38.890> all<00:06:39.010> those<00:06:39.190> different<00:06:39.340> things

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:39.580 
masks and all those different things

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:41.610 
masks and all those different things
