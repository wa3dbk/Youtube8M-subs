00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:15.840
 O 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.990
 Hello dear , my name is outside 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.400
 so milder and today I want you 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.470
 welcome to a whole 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.490
 special unboxing video of this 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.180
 small game 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.770
 the bks friedek costs about 25 euros 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.810
 only mixture to have lived 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.600
 i wondered is this deck 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.160
 really worth 25 euros together with you 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.150
 I want to share it with you in this video today 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.650
 find out you 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.730
 we will look at every detail 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.920
 and you can then enter it yourself 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.510
 Judgment about it make a hero to this 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.829
 As always you can find game in the video 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:49.120
 Description Let's take a look today 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:52.059
 the box 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.370
 you see these cards are in a rather 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:57.010
 kept vintage moderate design 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:59.469
 If I tell you the current modern 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.840
 offers show company keep in mind you 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:04.000
 also very clear what I mean here 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.770
 the side we have the modern 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.190
 lettering as they are sold today 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:11.470
 and forth suggesting the on 1902 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.470
 is rather due to that older 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.240
 design from this time we take that 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:21.369
 all around and look at the bag designs 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:23.350
 you see that the square street rather 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.659
 it's just plain you see 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.580
 twice the lettering quality was 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:29.740
 probably justify the 25 euros 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.840
 should be what it costs and on the other 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.390
 side of you on the right you can see it all 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.310
 normal offers with the diamondback 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.159
 design that's what it's called 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.140
 Borderless is in this game we will 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:42.909
 have a bit of magic and a rand 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.390
 flashes mostly but also better 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:46.600
 looks 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:49.470
 well then we open the whole time and 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.470
 Let's take a closer look 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.890
 and that the slide counts from now only 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.560
 still the lax out that you know 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.159
 sure and now we'll take a look 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.159
 first time 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:13.250
 yes, we can put it away first 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:15.980
 and so put, we put first 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.540
 look at these cards a lot 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.870
 I find it very positive that you are here 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:23.270
 even blue blue cards just have that 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.680
 Of course they are not even promotional 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.450
 cards i believe this is easy on 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.160
 magic thought that maybe 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.230
 change cards from the back 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.290
 So as I said here we have a spade 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.120
 what's in a blue back 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.130
 Let's look at the next blue card 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.940
 what 's left a blank card 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.680
 cool 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.830
 you can probably do that too 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.660
 do some nice tricks these are the ones 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.910
 special cards at son and covers 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.040
 for 25 euros are not already 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.739
 bad yes but usually if you 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.870
 would buy a steamed deck 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.610
 you already have some money for it 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.430
 spend on this special printed 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:02.209
 cards we look at the rest 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:05.000
 now comes the game the joker that is 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:07.340
 the standard as design where the little one 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.560
 Clown on stage dances here rather the 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.140
 bee normally lighter here in here 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.299
 so a burgundy but that are 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.989
 Usually I also card out 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:16.989
 take out the deck 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.820
 Let us now approach the game 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.320
 the 52 really full-sized cards for 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.200
 ok the picasa you see here 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.180
 that the best card of course and that 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.329
 is really nothing special of 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:37.060
 frontdesign a normal whole 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:37.060
 normal indexing with small index 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:44.269
 Let's look at the picture cards now 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:46.970
 yes that's more like I said one 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:48.670
 a little darker in the motto here 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.380
 kept a little golden so in the 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.030
 golden tones are there when we are 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.590
 Keep looking and the lady sees exactly 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.030
 so I'm curious comparison 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.360
 how the red cards look 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:02.329
 Here you see the lady the king so 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.440
 The design of the king is nothing 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:05.359
 it has changed only here 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.160
 only in the colors was played 

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:09.320
 okay but I think it's really complete 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.720
 succeeded really looks very pretty 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.980
 Now that's calling the red cards , too 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.449
 not important red I hope you see 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.180
 that here too it is more so and so 

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:18.590
 boats on the maps on it is 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.220
 it is not a bright red 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.020
 So let's take a look at the red ones 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:28.850
 please here 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:31.520
 cross me too cards pay the 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:34.070
 kreuzgarten see again straight from the heart 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.139
 again the same so the same the 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:38.510
 same color spectrum as changes in 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:39.830
 no picture card something because it just 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.810
 Also classic is held 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.669
 So somebody here somehow like that 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.530
 he had expected peaceful play 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:47.690
 every picture card is somehow different 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.190
 he has patterns or other color in 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:51.740
 this way wrong here but it is synonymous 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.540
 not so here it comes so to 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:58.010
 These old casino times are over 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:05:00.710
 imitate where you had beautiful decks 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:04.130
 but they were simple and all that 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:06.500
 represents this game as I said 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:07.910
 I also believe it is for flashing 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.850
 super I mean it so far that map 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:13.250
 stratec and it even if the game is not 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:15.919
 it is very solid 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.960
 nice and I think yes it has 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:19.699
 So the explosive power of the cards is 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.020
 not as stiff as you, maybe 

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:23.300
 you know it from other games you know 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.070
 freshly opened perhaps it falls it 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.380
 difficult for example at the beginning with a 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:29.540
 to make a whole new game with jumps 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.160
 In this game I have to say that it 

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.510
 very easy because the cards are not 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.560
 as stiff as you are 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:36.169
 maybe in the beginning before 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.729
 So as I said at the beginning you can 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:41.030
 make a great spring here 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:43.580
 you can see the super fans so look 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:45.260
 you are wonderful at the subjects 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.580
 yes also made for this purpose for 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:50.409
 just meat 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:52.699
 and fans fall so great too 

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:54.800
 So it's always good, too 

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:58.219
 if you have for example the next swing makes 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:00.379
 and the cards stay in one in one 

00:05:58.219 --> 00:06:02.810
 stack up that well whatever 

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:04.699
 beneficial for fresh so my conclusion 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.930
 I like this game 

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:08.360
 personally very very good 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:09.800
 it can actually be done with it 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.990
 work before it's important 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:14.330
 broken especially cool I think 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.860
 also these special cards you 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.110
 Of course, you can also use it for tricks 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:21.440
 and that monument can stain blue so 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:23.690
 really everything together with a really great game 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:26.569
 where you can meat and magic with 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:28.610
 and I think 25 euros is clear 

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:30.680
 a bit much but also especially for 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:33.050
 people who are special games 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:36.500
 this is definitely a good thing 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:37.789
 So have fun with it pretty and shows 

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:39.860
 me maybe a few comments 

00:06:37.789 --> 00:06:41.060
 if we also like the game if 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:41.690
 you brought it to me I would 

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:44.469
 to be happy about 

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:44.469
 See you
