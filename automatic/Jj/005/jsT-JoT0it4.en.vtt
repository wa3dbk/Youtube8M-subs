at I got the door panel out both the
door<00:00:05.850> panels<00:00:06.180> are<00:00:06.240> all<00:00:06.390> this<00:00:06.629> one's<00:00:06.839> cut<00:00:07.080> apart

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:08.300 
door panels are all this one's cut apart

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.080 
door panels are all this one's cut apart
and<00:00:09.300> kind<00:00:09.570> of<00:00:09.630> get<00:00:09.750> an<00:00:09.780> idea<00:00:09.929> for<00:00:10.320> some<00:00:10.440> fitment

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:11.090 
and kind of get an idea for some fitment

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.110 
and kind of get an idea for some fitment
and<00:00:12.559> then<00:00:13.559> I'll<00:00:13.650> start<00:00:13.920> building<00:00:14.910> that<00:00:14.940> I

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
and then I'll start building that I

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.540 
and then I'll start building that I
don't<00:00:15.540> have<00:00:15.750> all<00:00:16.109> of<00:00:16.170> my<00:00:16.590> speakers<00:00:17.070> yet<00:00:17.279> I

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
don't have all of my speakers yet I

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.150 
don't have all of my speakers yet I
still<00:00:18.510> need<00:00:18.900> my<00:00:18.930> 5-inch<00:00:19.890> speakers<00:00:21.170> so<00:00:22.170> I'm

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
still need my 5-inch speakers so I'm

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.650 
still need my 5-inch speakers so I'm
going<00:00:23.310> to<00:00:23.369> wait<00:00:23.490> probably<00:00:23.760> till<00:00:24.240> I<00:00:24.300> get<00:00:24.480> those

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
going to wait probably till I get those

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.370 
going to wait probably till I get those
unless<00:00:24.930> I<00:00:25.140> just<00:00:25.320> want<00:00:25.470> to<00:00:25.529> kind<00:00:25.740> of<00:00:25.830> guess<00:00:26.010> on<00:00:26.220> a

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380 
unless I just want to kind of guess on a

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.689 
unless I just want to kind of guess on a
total<00:00:28.380> diameter<00:00:28.590> but<00:00:29.099> I<00:00:29.189> want<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:29.400> be<00:00:29.490> able<00:00:29.550> to

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
total diameter but I want to be able to

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.359 
total diameter but I want to be able to
test<00:00:29.910> fit<00:00:30.119> them<00:00:30.240> before<00:00:30.570> I<00:00:30.679> get<00:00:31.679> too<00:00:31.830> far<00:00:32.070> so

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
test fit them before I get too far so

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.200 
test fit them before I get too far so
I'm<00:00:32.460> kind<00:00:32.669> of<00:00:32.700> holding<00:00:32.969> off<00:00:33.149> on<00:00:33.180> that<00:00:35.210> some

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
I'm kind of holding off on that some

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.260 
I'm kind of holding off on that some
other<00:00:36.270> stuff<00:00:36.719> I've<00:00:36.960> been<00:00:37.110> working<00:00:37.500> on<00:00:38.420> is<00:00:40.219> the

up there fiberglass the inside of the

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.510 
up there fiberglass the inside of the
ports<00:00:50.360> just<00:00:51.360> just<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.379> layer<00:00:52.649> of<00:00:52.680> resin<00:00:53.039> just

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
ports just just a layer of resin just

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.139 
ports just just a layer of resin just
for<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:54.420> air<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.629> flow<00:00:54.930> on<00:00:55.670> door<00:00:56.670> panels<00:00:56.910> are

for the air to flow on door panels are

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.560 
for the air to flow on door panels are
off<00:00:58.039> you<00:00:59.039> can<00:00:59.219> kind<00:00:59.399> of<00:00:59.520> see<00:00:59.699> behind<00:01:00.059> that<00:01:00.270> rail

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
off you can kind of see behind that rail

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.369 
off you can kind of see behind that rail
there<00:01:00.870> that<00:01:01.289> I<00:01:01.320> formed<00:01:02.510> in<00:01:03.510> between<00:01:03.899> that<00:01:04.049> rail

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
there that I formed in between that rail

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.190 
there that I formed in between that rail
and<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:05.369> outside<00:01:05.790> door<00:01:06.030> door<00:01:06.689> skin<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:09.200> you

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
and the outside door door skin and you

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.370 
and the outside door door skin and you
see<00:01:10.439> how<00:01:10.590> much<00:01:11.070> open<00:01:11.520> space<00:01:11.850> i<00:01:12.780> have<00:01:12.990> there<00:01:15.380> now

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
see how much open space i have there now

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.600 
see how much open space i have there now
if<00:01:16.470> you<00:01:16.560> look<00:01:16.680> at<00:01:16.830> this<00:01:16.979> one<00:01:17.189> there's<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.460> lot

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
if you look at this one there's a lot

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.920 
if you look at this one there's a lot
less<00:01:17.880> open<00:01:18.390> space<00:01:18.890> what<00:01:19.890> I'm<00:01:19.979> doing<00:01:20.009> is

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
less open space what I'm doing is

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.460 
less open space what I'm doing is
cutting<00:01:21.930> sections<00:01:22.830> of<00:01:23.189> this<00:01:23.930> 26<00:01:24.930> gauge<00:01:25.140> sheet

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
cutting sections of this 26 gauge sheet

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.190 
cutting sections of this 26 gauge sheet
out<00:01:26.060> covering<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.240> holes<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:27.900> then<00:01:28.020> just

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
out covering the holes and then just

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.870 
out covering the holes and then just
putting<00:01:28.710> some<00:01:28.740> more<00:01:29.040> mat<00:01:29.220> over<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.640> top<00:01:29.850> just

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
putting some more mat over the top just

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.960 
putting some more mat over the top just
so<00:01:30.530> less<00:01:31.530> air<00:01:31.799> is<00:01:32.009> actually<00:01:32.340> getting<00:01:32.549> inside

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
so less air is actually getting inside

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.319 
so less air is actually getting inside
the<00:01:33.090> door<00:01:33.240> pocket<00:01:34.549> doors<00:01:35.549> are<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.180> loudest

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
the door pocket doors are the loudest

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.870 
the door pocket doors are the loudest
part<00:01:36.780> of<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:36.960> car<00:01:37.170> outside<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.829> car<00:01:38.040> so<00:01:38.850> I

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
part of the car outside the car so I

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.760 
part of the car outside the car so I
want<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.150> try<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.450> take<00:01:40.049> care<00:01:40.229> of<00:01:40.290> that<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:40.619> get

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
want to try to take care of that and get

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.130 
want to try to take care of that and get
those<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:40.950> little<00:01:41.189> quieter<00:01:43.640> other<00:01:44.640> than<00:01:44.850> that

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
those a little quieter other than that

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.660 
those a little quieter other than that
car<00:01:46.140> should<00:01:46.290> be<00:01:46.320> pretty<00:01:46.590> much<00:01:46.829> rattle<00:01:47.189> free<00:01:47.490> a

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
car should be pretty much rattle free a

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.609 
car should be pretty much rattle free a
noise-free<00:01:48.030> outside<00:01:48.750> so<00:01:49.079> hopefully<00:01:49.439> this

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
noise-free outside so hopefully this

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.890 
noise-free outside so hopefully this
will<00:01:49.799> this<00:01:50.729> will<00:01:51.200> help<00:01:52.200> that<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.500> lot

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900 
will this will help that a lot

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.040 
will this will help that a lot
hopefully<00:01:54.910> I'll<00:01:55.910> still<00:01:56.120> have<00:01:56.360> a<00:01:56.600> couple<00:01:56.780> of

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 
hopefully I'll still have a couple of

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.680 
hopefully I'll still have a couple of
small<00:01:57.380> holes<00:01:57.770> but<00:01:58.760> not<00:01:58.940> a<00:01:58.970> lot<00:01:59.060> of<00:01:59.300> air<00:01:59.450> will<00:01:59.570> be

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
small holes but not a lot of air will be

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.300 
small holes but not a lot of air will be
able<00:01:59.780> to<00:01:59.960> escape<00:02:00.110> into<00:02:00.380> that<00:02:00.620> door<00:02:00.800> pocket<00:02:01.220> to

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
able to escape into that door pocket to

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.280 
able to escape into that door pocket to
be<00:02:01.430> able<00:02:01.520> to<00:02:01.670> make<00:02:01.700> that<00:02:01.820> flex<00:02:02.300> so<00:02:03.140> hopefully

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
be able to make that flex so hopefully

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.440 
be able to make that flex so hopefully
I'll<00:02:03.530> get<00:02:03.620> rid<00:02:03.740> all<00:02:03.890> that<00:02:04.150> but<00:02:05.150> that's<00:02:05.390> what

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
I'll get rid all that but that's what

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.170 
I'll get rid all that but that's what
I'm<00:02:05.600> working<00:02:05.750> on<00:02:05.930> right<00:02:05.990> now
