00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.780
 ah 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.850
 and that's how they are, I hope they are very 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.190
 well and then one of the two I'm going to 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.440
 teach how to shoot penalties in style 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.659
 panenka had already made a video tutorial 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.360
 in which he explained and showed them how 

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:03.299
 throw the penalties properly so 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.979
 fail as little as possible and well 

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:06.840
 this video also explained how to pull 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.330
 criminal panenka style but there is a 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.399
 good to receive a couple of comments 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.100
 of some subscribers asking me to 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:16.409
 will explain more thoroughly how to throw these 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.960
 criminal and well, here I bring you the 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.179
 video tutorial that they are asking me already 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.710
 they know that if they want a video tutorial 

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:24.720
 special gender saves in the 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.280
 comments and well I'll try to 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.960
 do it first of all as obviously 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.539
 we have to have a criminal situation 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.700
 and the truth is that it is relatively 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:35.759
 easy the only thing we have to do is 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.880
 with the l button one on the playstation and 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.230
 the slight one in the xbox and with the button 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.290
 obviously shot 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:47.200
 in the power indicator we have to 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.500
 to try to hit him always or at least 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.240
 as close as possible to the green zone 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.450
 so that our shot is the safest 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.370
 possible and with the joystick download everything and 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.310
 download everything down even though it's a 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:04.810
 absurd to download everything down to 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:07.030
 that our our grief has then the 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.770
 greater chance of it being hit already 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.770
 that if we put a lot of strength as you see 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:14.500
 the trigger indicator is enlarged and 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.960
 maybe the ball goes over the top 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.210
 but good 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.280
 Another thing that I want to mention is 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:23.980
 that at the time of doing this always 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.140
 As I told you, let's try to pull 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.030
 point and tighten at the precise moment 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.580
 the firing button in the green zone 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.620
 see how in these examples this already 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.690
 I'm pressing the trigger button to 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:38.440
 purpose in the yellow zone in the area 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:41.110
 orange and look like ronaldo Christian 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.000
 this time before pulling about 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.620
 small steps 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.799
 here they will be able to observe it again 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.840
 it does not have the green zone and typical 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:52.290
 ronaldo takes a few small steps before 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.150
 throw if you are an experienced player 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:59.019
 You will know immediately that you are trying 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:02.019
 throwing at the panenka that's why 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:05.069
 you should always try to select a 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:08.349
 player who has a high degree of 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:09.940
 penalties with a high level of penalties and 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:12.190
 obviously when throwing 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.680
 you can point to the green area and 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.109
 hit the green zone and in fact 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.579
 any player can do it but if 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:20.230
 they realize the bar that goes 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:23.170
 left to right in the bar 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:26.980
 power goes very slowly in a match already 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.810
 in fifa as good if 90 minutes is and 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.840
 if it is the 80th minute or if they are already times 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.910
 Additional features 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.370
 this bar that goes to the right is going to go 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.110
 faster then if we select a 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.319
 a player who has more level of 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:41.870
 criminal is more likely to have a 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:45.110
 the green zone because we will have more 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.670
 chance to hit it what it does 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.250
 we have a player who has almost no 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.620
 this feature and as I told them the 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.879
 ball or rather the bar that goes to 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.599
 divert to the right will go faster 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:59.690
 depending on the minute we are in 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:02.630
 about to collect the penalty then 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:06.769
 well that would be all as I told them the e1 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:10.180
 on playstation and lv on the xbox and with the 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:13.220
 button shot circle or depending 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.769
 what button you have set up you see 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.979
 in the xbox and then as simple as 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:22.340
 I told them skating to the green zone 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:23.900
 when we are firing and so good 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:28.840
 that would be all I hope there was 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.840
 liked see you in the next regards
