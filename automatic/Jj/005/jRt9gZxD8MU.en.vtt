00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
that so one of the themes of the film is

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.969 
that so one of the themes of the film is
this<00:01:14.060> idea<00:01:14.240> of<00:01:14.540> changing<00:01:15.320> perception

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
this idea of changing perception

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:18.609 
this idea of changing perception
