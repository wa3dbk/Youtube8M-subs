00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
that looks like the real deal doesn't

that looks like the real deal doesn't
Mike<00:00:15.560> look<00:00:16.560> at<00:00:16.680> that<00:00:16.830> corrugated<00:00:17.730> texture<00:00:18.570> on

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:18.780 
Mike look at that corrugated texture on

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:28.320 
Mike look at that corrugated texture on
the<00:00:19.020> control<00:00:19.980> surfaces

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:28.330 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:33.010 

off<00:00:29.330> we<00:00:29.720> go<00:00:29.930> into<00:00:30.320> the<00:00:31.160> beautiful<00:00:31.660> blue<00:00:32.660> sky

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
off we go into the beautiful blue sky

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.440 
off we go into the beautiful blue sky
and<00:00:33.440> we<00:00:34.220> are<00:00:34.370> turning<00:00:34.520> around<00:00:34.730> coming<00:00:35.270> back

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
look like the real deal pilots this is a

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.890 
look like the real deal pilots this is a
very<00:00:56.269> fun<00:00:56.600> flying<00:00:56.900> plane<00:00:57.230> and<00:00:58.269> of<00:00:59.269> course<00:00:59.660> it's

00:00:59.890 --> 00:00:59.900 
very fun flying plane and of course it's

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.479 
very fun flying plane and of course it's
a<00:01:00.050> scale<00:01:00.860> plane<00:01:01.250> it<00:01:01.579> is<00:01:02.239> capable<00:01:02.690> of

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
a scale plane it is capable of

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:06.550 
a scale plane it is capable of
aerobatics<00:01:04.750> although<00:01:05.750> it's<00:01:05.869> not<00:01:06.020> really<00:01:06.290> what

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
aerobatics although it's not really what

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.820 
aerobatics although it's not really what
you<00:01:06.680> do<00:01:06.830> with<00:01:07.009> these<00:01:07.220> but<00:01:08.410> do<00:01:09.410> what<00:01:09.560> you<00:01:09.590> want

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
you do with these but do what you want

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.480 
you do with these but do what you want
you<00:01:09.920> can<00:01:10.040> hover<00:01:10.250> it<00:01:10.479> a<00:01:11.479> little<00:01:12.110> bit<00:01:12.369> but<00:01:13.369> it's

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
you can hover it a little bit but it's

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.850 
you can hover it a little bit but it's
fun<00:01:13.670> to<00:01:13.759> practice<00:01:13.970> spins<00:01:14.570> and<00:01:14.990> recoveries<00:01:15.590> and

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
fun to practice spins and recoveries and

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.550 
fun to practice spins and recoveries and
things<00:01:16.580> like<00:01:16.789> that<00:01:19.570> it'll<00:01:20.570> fly<00:01:20.869> invert<00:01:21.259> it<00:01:21.440> of

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
things like that it'll fly invert it of

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.590 
things like that it'll fly invert it of
course<00:01:21.710> you<00:01:21.860> need<00:01:22.039> some<00:01:22.070> down<00:01:22.460> pressure<00:01:22.850> to

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
course you need some down pressure to

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.020 
course you need some down pressure to
keep<00:01:23.780> it<00:01:23.960> there<00:01:24.229> not<00:01:24.770> a<00:01:24.800> whole<00:01:25.070> lot<00:01:25.100> this

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
keep it there not a whole lot this

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.330 
keep it there not a whole lot this
reminds<00:01:26.450> me<00:01:26.570> of<00:01:26.690> a<00:01:26.840> biplane<00:01:27.080> when<00:01:27.800> it's<00:01:27.950> upside

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
reminds me of a biplane when it's upside

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.980 
reminds me of a biplane when it's upside
down<00:01:28.369> it<00:01:28.729> really<00:01:28.940> doesn't<00:01:29.360> take<00:01:29.509> much<00:01:29.539> down

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
down it really doesn't take much down

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:37.380 
down it really doesn't take much down
pressure<00:01:30.289> at<00:01:30.470> all<00:01:30.560> to<00:01:30.710> keep<00:01:30.920> it<00:01:31.039> there

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.440 

yeah<00:01:38.390> like<00:01:38.630> I<00:01:38.780> said<00:01:38.810> guys<00:01:39.290> this<00:01:39.350> is<00:01:39.740> a<00:01:40.450> first

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
yeah like I said guys this is a first

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:42.850 
yeah like I said guys this is a first
day<00:01:41.659> for<00:01:41.869> this<00:01:41.930> plane<00:01:42.200> for<00:01:42.409> me

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
day for this plane for me

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.490 
day for this plane for me
Mike's<00:01:43.250> got<00:01:43.520> one<00:01:43.759> this<00:01:44.479> is<00:01:44.689> my<00:01:44.810> second<00:01:45.229> battery

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
Mike's got one this is my second battery

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.170 
Mike's got one this is my second battery
through<00:01:45.770> it<00:01:45.920> and<00:01:46.579> I'm<00:01:46.880> starting<00:01:47.149> to

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
through it and I'm starting to

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:54.490 
through it and I'm starting to
understand<00:01:47.570> what<00:01:47.720> it<00:01:47.780> takes<00:01:53.110> takes<00:01:54.110> a<00:01:54.259> light

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
understand what it takes takes a light

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:35.690 
understand what it takes takes a light
touch
