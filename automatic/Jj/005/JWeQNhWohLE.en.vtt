interesting because it has an air lock

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.259 
interesting because it has an air lock
on<00:00:46.420> the<00:00:46.600> north<00:00:46.899> end<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:48.370> the<00:00:48.789> reason<00:00:49.059> why<00:00:49.149> we

00:00:49.259 --> 00:00:49.269 
on the north end and the reason why we

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:51.299 
on the north end and the reason why we
can<00:00:49.390> do<00:00:49.629> that<00:00:49.839> is<00:00:50.170> that<00:00:50.379> we<00:00:50.440> have<00:00:50.679> a<00:00:50.710> round<00:00:51.100> tank

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:51.309 
can do that is that we have a round tank

link up to the stairs this one was done
with<00:01:40.300> 6x6<00:01:41.300> construction<00:01:42.250> let's<00:01:43.250> start<00:01:43.520> with<00:01:43.640> a

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
with 6x6 construction let's start with a

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.120 
with 6x6 construction let's start with a
small<00:01:44.150> plant<00:01:44.600> at<00:01:44.720> the<00:01:44.840> bottom<00:01:45.170> here<00:01:45.470> following

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
small plant at the bottom here following

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.680 
small plant at the bottom here following
the<00:01:46.250> tank<00:01:46.810> and<00:01:47.810> as<00:01:47.930> we<00:01:48.110> follow<00:01:48.320> up<00:01:49.420> we've<00:01:50.420> got

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
the tank and as we follow up we've got

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.889 
the tank and as we follow up we've got
like<00:01:50.869> a<00:01:51.050> bar<00:01:51.560> here<00:01:52.009> that'll<00:01:52.430> support

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 
like a bar here that'll support

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:55.749 
like a bar here that'll support
hydroponic<00:01:53.899> tubs<00:01:54.200> which<00:01:54.890> they'll<00:01:55.220> go<00:01:55.369> all<00:01:55.610> the

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
hydroponic tubs which they'll go all the

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:57.160 
hydroponic tubs which they'll go all the
way<00:01:55.790> across<00:01:55.880> here<00:01:56.390> here's<00:01:56.720> one<00:01:56.930> of<00:01:57.050> them

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
way across here here's one of them

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.600 
way across here here's one of them
existing<00:01:57.710> and<00:01:58.660> we<00:01:59.660> have<00:01:59.840> a<00:02:00.040> large<00:02:01.040> 12-foot

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
existing and we have a large 12-foot

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:07.270 
existing and we have a large 12-foot
tank<00:02:01.910> in<00:02:02.750> diameter<00:02:05.530> and<00:02:06.530> as<00:02:06.770> I<00:02:06.920> swing<00:02:07.160> around

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
tank in diameter and as I swing around

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:17.910 
tank in diameter and as I swing around
you'll<00:02:07.910> see<00:02:07.970> the<00:02:08.330> six<00:02:09.200> by<00:02:09.380> sixes

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.910 

these<00:02:18.520> are<00:02:18.849> 34<00:02:19.660> inches<00:02:20.170> away<00:02:20.349> from<00:02:20.530> the<00:02:20.740> wall

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
these are 34 inches away from the wall

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.059 
these are 34 inches away from the wall
and<00:02:21.840> therefore<00:02:22.840> course<00:02:23.290> is<00:02:23.440> high<00:02:23.590> which<00:02:23.890> will

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
and therefore course is high which will

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:29.000 
and therefore course is high which will
make<00:02:24.190> it<00:02:24.510> 24<00:02:25.510> and<00:02:26.400> because<00:02:27.400> the<00:02:27.580> rough<00:02:27.849> timbers

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
make it 24 and because the rough timbers

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.640 
make it 24 and because the rough timbers
and<00:02:30.010> I'll<00:02:30.130> interlock<00:02:30.610> the<00:02:30.819> corners<00:02:31.270> with

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
and I'll interlock the corners with

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.010 
and I'll interlock the corners with
traditional<00:02:32.650> screws<00:02:32.950> and<00:02:33.280> then<00:02:33.430> 10<00:02:33.730> inch

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
traditional screws and then 10 inch

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:46.940 
traditional screws and then 10 inch
timber<00:02:35.020> screws<00:02:35.580> together

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.990 

there's<00:02:47.950> the<00:02:48.099> tank<00:02:48.340> in<00:02:48.459> all<00:02:48.550> its<00:02:48.790> glory

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
there's the tank in all its glory

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.900 
there's the tank in all its glory
you<00:02:52.000> can<00:02:52.150> look<00:02:52.420> as<00:02:53.050> the<00:02:53.290> reflectix<00:02:53.800> are<00:02:54.010> all

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
you can look as the reflectix are all

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.680 
you can look as the reflectix are all
fastened<00:02:56.280> and<00:02:57.280> we<00:02:57.730> actually<00:02:57.880> have<00:02:58.209> double

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
and I always like to do like to match

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.290 
and I always like to do like to match
things<00:03:14.580> so<00:03:14.940> you<00:03:15.510> have<00:03:15.570> opposing<00:03:16.730> angles<00:03:17.730> flow

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
things so you have opposing angles flow

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.360 
things so you have opposing angles flow
into<00:03:18.600> the<00:03:18.690> tank<00:03:18.990> and<00:03:19.230> flow<00:03:19.500> around<00:03:20.040> the<00:03:20.190> wall

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
into the tank and flow around the wall

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.130 
into the tank and flow around the wall
and<00:03:20.940> as<00:03:21.930> I<00:03:22.050> swing<00:03:22.380> the<00:03:22.470> camera<00:03:22.740> up<00:03:23.690> you<00:03:24.690> can<00:03:24.930> see
