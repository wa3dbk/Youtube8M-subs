he's<00:01:46.020> interested<00:01:46.439> in<00:01:46.710> this<00:01:46.860> technology<00:01:47.610> it

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
he's interested in this technology it

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.410 
he's interested in this technology it
must<00:01:48.360> have<00:01:48.509> value<00:01:49.430> are<00:01:50.430> you<00:01:50.759> saying<00:01:51.090> there's

must have value are you saying there's

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.350 
must have value are you saying there's
profit<00:01:51.750> in<00:01:52.049> this<00:01:52.229> think<00:01:53.009> about<00:01:53.280> it<00:01:53.520> it<00:01:53.759> may<00:01:54.299> be
