they've actually created something

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:11.719 
they've actually created something
completely<00:01:08.369> original<00:01:10.009> I'm<00:01:11.009> basing

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
completely original I'm basing

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.849 
completely original I'm basing
themselves<00:01:12.600> in<00:01:13.020> that<00:01:13.049> concept<00:01:13.560> of<00:01:13.649> flappy

themselves in that concept of flappy
birds<00:01:14.159> it's<00:01:14.520> amazing<00:01:14.869> at<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.049> same<00:01:16.079> time<00:01:16.560> I'm

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
birds it's amazing at the same time I'm

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.660 
birds it's amazing at the same time I'm
so<00:01:17.399> frustrated<00:01:17.789> by<00:01:19.219> some<00:01:20.219> of<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.460> choices

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
so frustrated by some of the choices

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.230 
so frustrated by some of the choices
that<00:01:21.000> they've<00:01:21.539> made<00:01:22.250> like<00:01:23.250> you<00:01:24.030> have

that they've made like you have
something<00:01:24.770> wish<00:01:25.770> with<00:01:26.640> way<00:01:27.000> more<00:01:27.030> complexity

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
something wish with way more complexity

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.520 
something wish with way more complexity
than<00:01:28.649> the<00:01:29.159> original<00:01:29.640> flappy<00:01:29.909> bird<00:01:30.179> but<00:01:31.079> then

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
of how hard this game is and it gets to

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
put it feel kind of feels like it's hard

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.450 
put it feel kind of feels like it's hard
for<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.850> sake<00:02:00.149> of<00:02:00.179> being<00:02:01.020> hard<00:02:01.409> first<00:02:02.280> of<00:02:02.399> all

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
for the sake of being hard first of all

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.580 
for the sake of being hard first of all
it's<00:02:02.609> harder<00:02:03.090> because<00:02:03.299> you're<00:02:03.990> not<00:02:04.200> moving<00:02:04.499> in

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
it's harder because you're not moving in

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.390 
lines upside down actually it does it's
it<00:02:11.760> doesn't<00:02:12.150> feel<00:02:12.330> that<00:02:12.540> natural<00:02:13.200> so<00:02:14.159> that's

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
it doesn't feel that natural so that's

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.580 
it doesn't feel that natural so that's
hard<00:02:14.670> but<00:02:15.090> it's<00:02:15.209> okay<00:02:15.450> you<00:02:15.510> know<00:02:15.750> this

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
hard but it's okay you know this

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.610 
hard but it's okay you know this
games<00:02:16.739> are<00:02:16.980> supposed<00:02:17.580> to<00:02:17.940> be<00:02:18.090> hard<00:02:18.410> but<00:02:19.410> at<00:02:19.560> the

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
games are supposed to be hard but at the

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.309 
games are supposed to be hard but at the
same<00:02:19.769> time<00:02:20.040> then<00:02:20.340> you<00:02:20.370> have<00:02:20.700> a<00:02:21.170> not<00:02:22.170> only

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
same time then you have a not only

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.190 
same time then you have a not only
flappy<00:02:22.769> bird<00:02:22.980> moving<00:02:23.340> but<00:02:23.700> the<00:02:24.090> lines<00:02:24.959> are

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
flappy bird moving but the lines are

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.259 
flappy bird moving but the lines are
also<00:02:25.560> moving<00:02:26.010> towards<00:02:26.610> you<00:02:26.790> and<00:02:26.940> not<00:02:27.150> only

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
also moving towards you and not only

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.059 
also moving towards you and not only
that<00:02:27.420> but<00:02:27.629> the<00:02:27.959> lines<00:02:28.170> are<00:02:28.319> moving<00:02:28.680> up<00:02:28.830> and

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
that but the lines are moving up and

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.680 
that but the lines are moving up and
down<00:02:29.190> so<00:02:29.489> you<00:02:29.610> actually<00:02:29.760> have<00:02:30.120> to<00:02:30.269> predict

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
down so you actually have to predict

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.440 
down so you actually have to predict
where<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:32.129> gap<00:02:32.370> between<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:32.970> lines<00:02:33.150> will<00:02:33.420> be

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
where the gap between the lines will be

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.740 
where the gap between the lines will be
once<00:02:34.260> you<00:02:34.440> get<00:02:34.650> past<00:02:35.400> them<00:02:36.120> so<00:02:36.299> you<00:02:36.390> have<00:02:36.540> to<00:02:36.629> be

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
once you get past them so you have to be

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.839 
once you get past them so you have to be
like<00:02:36.959> looking<00:02:37.379> at<00:02:37.530> all<00:02:37.769> these<00:02:38.220> things<00:02:38.549> at<00:02:38.730> the

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
like looking at all these things at the

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:41.509 
like looking at all these things at the
same<00:02:39.180> time<00:02:39.629> and<00:02:40.049> I<00:02:40.830> just<00:02:41.040> feel<00:02:41.220> they<00:02:41.370> would

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
same time and I just feel they would

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.729 
same time and I just feel they would
have<00:02:41.610> been<00:02:41.730> very<00:02:42.060> easy<00:02:42.209> for<00:02:42.690> them<00:02:43.349> to<00:02:43.410> actually

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
have been very easy for them to actually

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.750 
have been very easy for them to actually
you<00:02:44.519> know<00:02:44.610> create<00:02:45.060> like<00:02:45.870> the<00:02:46.110> sense<00:02:46.410> like<00:02:46.760> the

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
you know create like the sense like the

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.240 
you know create like the sense like the
thing<00:02:47.910> about<00:02:48.120> their<00:02:48.870> games<00:02:49.500> there's<00:02:49.980> nothing

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
thing about their games there's nothing

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.360 
thing about their games there's nothing
wrong<00:02:50.400> with<00:02:50.459> games<00:02:50.819> me<00:02:51.030> hard<00:02:51.269> right<00:02:52.370> but

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
wrong with games me hard right but

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.339 
wrong with games me hard right but
there's<00:02:53.549> also<00:02:53.760> you<00:02:54.420> have<00:02:54.599> to<00:02:54.630> keep<00:02:54.900> a<00:02:54.959> balance

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
there's also you have to keep a balance

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:58.400 
there's also you have to keep a balance
between<00:02:56.090> challenge<00:02:57.090> and<00:02:57.420> reward<00:02:57.959> you<00:02:58.170> want<00:02:58.349> a

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
between challenge and reward you want a

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.610 
between challenge and reward you want a
game<00:02:58.650> to<00:02:58.829> feel<00:02:59.040> rewarding<00:02:59.880> and<00:03:00.780> not<00:03:00.989> just<00:03:01.319> you

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
game to feel rewarding and not just you

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.500 
game to feel rewarding and not just you
know<00:03:01.769> make<00:03:02.430> it<00:03:02.579> hard<00:03:02.849> for<00:03:02.910> the<00:03:03.120> sake<00:03:03.269> of<00:03:03.299> being

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
know make it hard for the sake of being

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.819 
know make it hard for the sake of being
hard<00:03:03.840> because<00:03:03.989> what<00:03:04.470> what<00:03:04.980> does<00:03:05.160> that<00:03:05.340> even<00:03:05.720> do

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:06.829 
hard because what what does that even do

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:09.470 
hard because what what does that even do
for<00:03:07.829> you<00:03:07.950> for<00:03:08.250> the<00:03:08.310> player<00:03:08.760> you<00:03:09.030> know<00:03:09.150> just

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
for you for the player you know just

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.240 
for you for the player you know just
hard<00:03:09.900> for<00:03:10.049> the<00:03:10.170> sake<00:03:10.290> of<00:03:10.319> being<00:03:10.530> hard<00:03:10.769> okay<00:03:11.010> you

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
hard for the sake of being hard okay you

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.900 
hard for the sake of being hard okay you
want<00:03:11.430> to<00:03:11.579> reward<00:03:12.980> you<00:03:13.980> want<00:03:14.160> to<00:03:14.250> challenge<00:03:14.519> and

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
want to reward you want to challenge and

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.150 
want to reward you want to challenge and
reward<00:03:15.360> challenge<00:03:15.959> and<00:03:16.170> reward<00:03:16.560> challenge

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
reward challenge and reward challenge

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.000 
reward challenge and reward challenge
and<00:03:17.370> reward<00:03:17.760> so<00:03:18.030> that's<00:03:18.269> a<00:03:18.510> why<00:03:19.200> most<00:03:19.620> games

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
and reward so that's a why most games

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.270 
and reward so that's a why most games
around<00:03:20.850> the<00:03:20.970> world<00:03:21.209> will<00:03:21.600> start<00:03:22.049> to<00:03:22.380> start<00:03:23.069> off

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
around the world will start to start off

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.460 
around the world will start to start off
a<00:03:23.430> little<00:03:23.609> bit<00:03:23.760> easier<00:03:24.239> and<00:03:24.420> then<00:03:24.569> and<00:03:24.900> get<00:03:24.989> get

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
a little bit easier and then and get get

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.370 
a little bit easier and then and get get
harder<00:03:25.920> as<00:03:26.069> the<00:03:26.130> game<00:03:26.670> progresses<00:03:27.120> and<00:03:27.450> I<00:03:28.170> feel

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
harder as the game progresses and I feel

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.520 
harder as the game progresses and I feel
like<00:03:28.500> they<00:03:29.069> could<00:03:29.130> have<00:03:29.370> done<00:03:29.579> this<00:03:29.609> very

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
like they could have done this very

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.289 
like they could have done this very
easily<00:03:31.530> with<00:03:31.950> this<00:03:32.370> design<00:03:32.670> first<00:03:33.000> of<00:03:33.150> all

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
easily with this design first of all

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.509 
easily with this design first of all
maybe<00:03:33.930> at<00:03:34.530> the<00:03:34.680> beginning<00:03:34.769> of<00:03:35.069> the<00:03:35.220> game<00:03:35.340> may

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
maybe at the beginning of the game may

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.490 
maybe at the beginning of the game may
be<00:03:35.579> the<00:03:35.760> first<00:03:35.940> levels<00:03:36.389> may<00:03:36.569> be<00:03:36.630> from<00:03:36.959> 1<00:03:37.170> to<00:03:37.290> 10

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
be the first levels may be from 1 to 10

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.559 
be the first levels may be from 1 to 10
uh<00:03:38.870> flappy<00:03:39.870> bird<00:03:40.079> doesn't<00:03:40.319> move<00:03:40.530> the<00:03:41.389> only<00:03:42.389> the

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
uh flappy bird doesn't move the only the

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:45.890 
uh flappy bird doesn't move the only the
bars<00:03:42.959> move<00:03:43.410> towards<00:03:44.250> you<00:03:44.489> and<00:03:44.700> then<00:03:44.760> from<00:03:45.510> 11

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
bars move towards you and then from 11

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.039 
bars move towards you and then from 11
to<00:03:45.989> 20<00:03:46.319> maybe<00:03:46.940> the<00:03:47.940> more<00:03:48.150> the<00:03:48.450> bars<00:03:48.660> start

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
to 20 maybe the more the bars start

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:52.250 
to 20 maybe the more the bars start
moving<00:03:49.349> up<00:03:49.500> and<00:03:49.650> down<00:03:49.769> as<00:03:50.220> as<00:03:50.819> they<00:03:51.419> do<00:03:51.480> as<00:03:51.870> they

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
moving up and down as as they do as they

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.500 
moving up and down as as they do as they
come<00:03:52.530> towards<00:03:52.919> you<00:03:53.130> and<00:03:53.340> maybe<00:03:53.790> from<00:03:55.700> 30<00:03:56.700> to<00:03:56.819> 40

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
come towards you and maybe from 30 to 40

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.830 
come towards you and maybe from 30 to 40
a<00:03:57.870> flappy<00:03:58.470> bird<00:03:58.709> starts<00:03:59.130> moving<00:03:59.549> and<00:03:59.840> maybe

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
a flappy bird starts moving and maybe

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.460 
a flappy bird starts moving and maybe
but<00:04:01.530> maybe<00:04:01.769> the<00:04:02.340> the<00:04:02.700> the<00:04:03.389> bar<00:04:03.569> start<00:04:03.959> stop

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
but maybe the the the bar start stop

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:05.809 
but maybe the the the bar start stop
moving<00:04:04.769> up<00:04:04.889> and<00:04:05.010> down<00:04:05.130> but<00:04:05.519> then<00:04:05.700> you

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
moving up and down but then you

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:07.400 
moving up and down but then you
incorporate<00:04:06.299> that<00:04:06.480> I<00:04:06.690> just<00:04:06.959> feel<00:04:07.109> like<00:04:07.200> they

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
incorporate that I just feel like they

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.150 
incorporate that I just feel like they
created<00:04:07.859> such<00:04:08.099> a<00:04:09.079> they<00:04:10.079> have<00:04:10.290> had<00:04:10.799> such<00:04:11.130> a

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
created such a they have had such a

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.280 
created such a they have had such a
great<00:04:11.430> idea<00:04:11.519> such<00:04:12.060> a<00:04:12.090> great<00:04:12.359> implementation
