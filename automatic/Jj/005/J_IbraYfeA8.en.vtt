00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
earlier so if you look at the three

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.460 
earlier so if you look at the three
games<00:02:33.600> in<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:33.900> round<00:02:34.190> 10<00:02:35.190> 10<00:02:35.490> and<00:02:35.700> 25<00:02:36.450> 45<00:02:37.050> look
