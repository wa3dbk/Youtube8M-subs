00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.100 

I<00:00:00.359> have<00:00:00.930> a<00:00:00.960> question<00:00:01.469> for<00:00:01.680> all<00:00:01.829> the<00:00:02.040> actors<00:00:03.110> how

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
I have a question for all the actors how

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.240 
I have a question for all the actors how
does<00:00:04.259> it<00:00:04.350> feel<00:00:04.529> to<00:00:04.740> be<00:00:04.859> an<00:00:04.950> actor<00:00:07.250> you're

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
does it feel to be an actor you're

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.360 
does it feel to be an actor you're
hungry<00:00:08.730> all<00:00:08.940> the<00:00:08.970> time

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:10.370 
hungry all the time

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.799 
hungry all the time
so<00:00:11.370> I<00:00:11.400> think<00:00:11.670> you<00:00:11.759> might<00:00:12.000> choose<00:00:12.210> places<00:00:12.660> for

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
so I think you might choose places for

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.079 
so I think you might choose places for
free<00:00:12.990> food<00:00:13.230> you<00:00:13.410> go

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:14.089 
free food you go

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:16.430
