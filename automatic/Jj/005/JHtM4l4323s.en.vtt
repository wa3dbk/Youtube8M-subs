00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 
types of campfires game to craft you

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:45.549 
types of campfires game to craft you
need<00:00:43.729> cobblestone<00:00:44.300> on<00:00:44.510> the<00:00:44.629> bottom<00:00:44.989> and<00:00:45.170> both

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
you'll see the difference in just a

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.829 
you'll see the difference in just a
second<00:00:48.789> first<00:00:49.789> one<00:00:49.969> is<00:00:50.059> crafted<00:00:50.510> with<00:00:50.539> coal

second first one is crafted with coal

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:53.319 
second first one is crafted with coal
like<00:00:51.800> that<00:00:51.979> this<00:00:52.219> is<00:00:52.399> a<00:00:52.429> campfire<00:00:52.969> with<00:00:53.239> a

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329 
like that this is a campfire with a

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:55.479 
like that this is a campfire with a
burning<00:00:53.569> GUI<00:00:53.960> and<00:00:54.379> the<00:00:54.889> same<00:00:55.069> the<00:00:55.219> other<00:00:55.249> ones

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
burning GUI and the same the other ones

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:57.039 
burning GUI and the same the other ones
just<00:00:55.519> hit<00:00:55.760> the<00:00:55.850> same<00:00:56.030> thing<00:00:56.210> and<00:00:56.389> we'll<00:00:56.839> see

00:00:57.039 --> 00:00:57.049 
just hit the same thing and we'll see

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:59.709 
just hit the same thing and we'll see
though<00:00:57.249> anyway<00:00:58.249> so<00:00:58.309> the<00:00:58.609> next<00:00:58.789> one<00:00:58.909> same

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
though anyway so the next one same

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:03.430

crafting but with a flint and steel and
this<00:01:03.589> is<00:01:03.769> always<00:01:04.220> active<00:01:04.690> alright<00:01:05.690> so<00:01:05.930> there's

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
this is always active alright so there's

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.500 
this is always active alright so there's
two<00:01:06.380> different<00:01:06.619> things<00:01:06.950> here<00:01:07.390> let's<00:01:08.390> see

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
two different things here let's see

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.020 
two different things here let's see
which<00:01:08.630> one<00:01:08.810> we<00:01:08.930> have<00:01:09.140> always<00:01:09.500> active<00:01:10.130> and<00:01:10.400> here

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
which one we have always active and here

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.880 
which one we have always active and here
let<00:01:11.210> me<00:01:11.330> let<00:01:11.840> me<00:01:11.930> turn<00:01:12.080> on<00:01:12.140> my<00:01:12.290> particles<00:01:12.740> let's

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
let me let me turn on my particles let's

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.370 
let me let me turn on my particles let's
make<00:01:13.040> sure<00:01:13.160> they're<00:01:13.310> all<00:01:13.340> the<00:01:13.550> way<00:01:13.610> on<00:01:13.790> and

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
make sure they're all the way on and

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.670 
make sure they're all the way on and
this<00:01:15.380> this<00:01:15.890> doesn't<00:01:16.340> really<00:01:16.610> do<00:01:16.850> much<00:01:17.320> if<00:01:18.320> it

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
this this doesn't really do much if it

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.620 
this this doesn't really do much if it
isn't<00:01:19.040> active<00:01:19.400> which<00:01:20.090> it'll<00:01:20.330> always<00:01:20.480> be

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
isn't active which it'll always be

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.380 
isn't active which it'll always be
because<00:01:20.930> of<00:01:21.170> this<00:01:21.320> being<00:01:21.950> active<00:01:22.430> basically

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
because of this being active basically

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.450 
because of this being active basically
this<00:01:23.570> is<00:01:23.630> all<00:01:23.990> that<00:01:24.230> it's<00:01:24.350> going<00:01:24.530> to<00:01:24.590> do<00:01:24.770> but

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
this is all that it's going to do but

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.210 
this is all that it's going to do but
this<00:01:25.700> could<00:01:26.090> be<00:01:26.270> used<00:01:26.570> for<00:01:26.870> so<00:01:27.380> much<00:01:27.890> like

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
this could be used for so much like

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.790 
this could be used for so much like
design<00:01:28.850> wise<00:01:29.180> it's<00:01:29.600> gonna<00:01:29.720> look<00:01:29.900> awesome<00:01:30.080> just

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:30.800 
design wise it's gonna look awesome just

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.640 
design wise it's gonna look awesome just
just<00:01:31.190> keeping<00:01:31.490> it<00:01:31.610> real<00:01:32.230> now<00:01:33.230> this<00:01:33.410> one's

basically for looks guys this next one
though<00:01:36.560> is<00:01:36.830> a<00:01:36.860> little<00:01:37.190> bit<00:01:37.280> different<00:01:37.670> as<00:01:37.820> you

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
though is a little bit different as you

can<00:01:38.120> see<00:01:38.330> this<00:01:38.510> one's<00:01:38.750> not<00:01:38.870> on<00:01:38.930> fire<00:01:39.490> but<00:01:40.490> you

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
can see this one's not on fire but you

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.690 
can see this one's not on fire but you
can<00:01:40.940> light<00:01:41.240> them<00:01:41.510> with<00:01:41.960> flint<00:01:42.290> and<00:01:42.350> steel<00:01:42.700> and

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
can light them with flint and steel and

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.550 
can light them with flint and steel and
as<00:01:43.820> you<00:01:44.000> can<00:01:44.150> see<00:01:44.180> this<00:01:44.540> has<00:01:44.600> actually<00:01:44.990> a<00:01:45.200> GUI

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
as you can see this has actually a GUI

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.800 
as you can see this has actually a GUI
in<00:01:45.890> here<00:01:46.130> the<00:01:46.850> fire<00:01:47.060> will<00:01:47.390> burn<00:01:47.450> out

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
in here the fire will burn out

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.270 
in here the fire will burn out
eventually<00:01:48.200> over<00:01:48.560> time<00:01:48.590> you<00:01:48.950> just<00:01:49.100> have<00:01:49.190> to

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
eventually over time you just have to

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.590 
eventually over time you just have to
keep<00:01:49.430> lighting<00:01:49.700> it<00:01:49.910> with<00:01:50.060> your<00:01:50.270> flint<00:01:50.570> and

keep lighting it with your flint and
steel<00:01:51.100> this<00:01:52.100> actually<00:01:52.460> has<00:01:53.060> a<00:01:53.330> smelting<00:01:53.840> GUI

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
steel this actually has a smelting GUI

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.870 
steel this actually has a smelting GUI
in<00:01:54.350> here<00:01:54.560> you<00:01:54.680> can't<00:01:54.920> smell<00:01:55.159> blocks<00:01:55.550> but<00:01:55.760> you

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
in here you can't smell blocks but you

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
can catch on fire from these things but

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.690 
can catch on fire from these things but
I<00:03:33.290> am<00:03:33.410> and<00:03:33.620> creative<00:03:34.010> mode<00:03:34.130> let's<00:03:34.310> switch<00:03:34.519> and

I am and creative mode let's switch and

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:35.890 
I am and creative mode let's switch and
see<00:03:34.819> if<00:03:34.910> we<00:03:35.000> can<00:03:35.150> actually<00:03:35.269> catch<00:03:35.540> on<00:03:35.690> fire

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
see if we can actually catch on fire

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:44.710
