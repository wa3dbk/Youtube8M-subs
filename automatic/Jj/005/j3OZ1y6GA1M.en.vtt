00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.330 
the game there are multiple color
schemes<00:01:30.210> some<00:01:30.930> obviously<00:01:31.799> being<00:01:32.009> better<00:01:32.250> than

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
schemes some obviously being better than

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.660 
schemes some obviously being better than
others<00:01:32.729> as<00:01:32.939> you<00:01:33.420> wouldn't<00:01:33.750> really<00:01:33.990> expect<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.860> a

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
others as you wouldn't really expect a a

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.300 
others as you wouldn't really expect a a
camouflage<00:01:36.479> pattern<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.170> be<00:01:37.409> on<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.590> spacesuit

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
camouflage pattern to be on a spacesuit

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.870 
camouflage pattern to be on a spacesuit
so<00:01:38.970> that's<00:01:39.119> why<00:01:39.979> personally<00:01:40.979> I<00:01:41.220> think<00:01:41.490> this

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
so that's why personally I think this

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.649 
so that's why personally I think this
all-white<00:01:42.979> layout<00:01:43.979> color<00:01:44.310> scheme<00:01:44.670> is<00:01:44.909> deadly

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
all-white layout color scheme is deadly

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.499 
all-white layout color scheme is deadly
the<00:01:45.780> best<00:01:45.960> is<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.259> most<00:01:46.439> traditional

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
the best is the most traditional

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:49.580 
the best is the most traditional
spacesuit<00:01:48.509> design<00:01:48.540> I<00:01:48.960> think<00:01:49.290> it<00:01:49.380> looks

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
spacesuit design I think it looks

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.960 
spacesuit design I think it looks
awesome<00:01:49.799> they'll<00:01:50.189> definitely<00:01:50.430> make<00:01:50.850> you

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.679 
stand out not sure if that's always a
good<00:01:52.619> thing<00:01:52.649> but<00:01:53.240> unfortunately<00:01:54.240> if<00:01:54.390> you

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
good thing but unfortunately if you

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.800 
good thing but unfortunately if you

stepping<00:02:36.409> up<00:02:36.560> with<00:02:37.400> their<00:02:37.609> uniqueness<00:02:38.030> factor

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
stepping up with their uniqueness factor
