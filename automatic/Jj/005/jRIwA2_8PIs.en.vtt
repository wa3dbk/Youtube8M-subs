the<00:00:05.640> main<00:00:05.910> thing<00:00:06.180> is<00:00:06.330> check<00:00:06.660> the<00:00:06.839> pH<00:00:07.080> of<00:00:07.379> that

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
the main thing is check the pH of that

you<00:00:19.529> know<00:00:19.650> six<00:00:19.980> five<00:00:20.279> in<00:00:21.240> this<00:00:21.449> part<00:00:21.689> of<00:00:21.720> the

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
you know six five in this part of the

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.570 
you know six five in this part of the
state<00:00:22.050> you<00:00:22.320> get<00:00:22.439> into<00:00:22.740> western<00:00:23.100> Kansas

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
state you get into western Kansas

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.460 
state you get into western Kansas
there'll<00:00:23.760> be<00:00:23.789> seven<00:00:24.119> five<00:00:24.449> eight<00:00:24.720> even<00:00:25.199> higher

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
there'll be seven five eight even higher

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.500 
there'll be seven five eight even higher
than<00:00:25.769> that<00:00:25.949> that's<00:00:26.580> one<00:00:26.939> of<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.119> reasons<00:00:27.390> so

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
than that that's one of the reasons so

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.839 
than that that's one of the reasons so
difficult<00:00:27.930> to<00:00:28.109> grow<00:00:28.289> them<00:00:28.470> out<00:00:28.619> there<00:00:28.890> even<00:00:29.580> in

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
difficult to grow them out there even in

the eastern part of the state normally

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.330 
the eastern part of the state normally
you<00:00:31.890> need<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.279> drop<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.880> pH<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.980> if<00:00:34.980> we're<00:00:35.219> at

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
you need to drop the pH and if we're at

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.220 
you need to drop the pH and if we're at
six<00:00:35.640> five<00:00:35.910> we<00:00:36.120> need<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.390> get<00:00:36.540> it<00:00:36.660> down<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:36.840> five

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
six five we need to get it down to five

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.410 
six five we need to get it down to five
we<00:00:37.469> need<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:37.800> use<00:00:38.040> sulfur<00:00:38.579> in<00:00:38.730> order<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.270> get

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
we need to use sulfur in order to get

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.420 
we need to use sulfur in order to get
that<00:00:39.570> pH<00:00:39.899> down<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.379> where<00:00:40.530> it<00:00:40.620> needs<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:40.920> be<00:00:41.040> and

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
that pH down to where it needs to be and

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.959 
that pH down to where it needs to be and
that<00:00:42.329> takes<00:00:42.690> time<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.350> so<00:00:44.040> with<00:00:44.280> blueberries

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
that takes time and so with blueberries

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.060 
that takes time and so with blueberries
it's<00:00:45.329> always<00:00:45.780> better<00:00:45.989> if<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.350> start<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.770> year

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
it's always better if you start a year

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.369 
it's always better if you start a year
ahead<00:00:47.219> of<00:00:47.520> time<00:00:47.730> if<00:00:48.000> you<00:00:48.629> can<00:00:48.750> get<00:00:48.930> all<00:00:49.200> your

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
ahead of time if you can get all your

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.959 
ahead of time if you can get all your
preparation<00:00:49.950> done<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.309> year<00:00:50.399> before<00:00:50.610> you're

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
preparation done the year before you're

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.319 
preparation done the year before you're
going<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.210> have<00:00:51.360> much<00:00:51.690> more<00:00:51.920> success<00:00:52.920> than<00:00:53.329> if

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
going to have much more success than if

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.229 
going to have much more success than if
you<00:00:54.629> try<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.350> plant<00:00:55.770> them<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.550> same<00:00:56.850> year<00:00:57.090> you

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
you try to plant them the same year you

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.389 
you try to plant them the same year you
do<00:00:57.420> your<00:00:57.629> prep<00:00:57.930> this<00:00:58.530> is<00:00:58.739> what<00:00:59.039> we<00:00:59.160> call<00:00:59.370> a

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
needs to be tilled in so that it

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
other things you need to do as far as

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.999 
other things you need to do as far as
preparation<00:01:18.479> is<00:01:18.869> concerned<00:01:19.049> as<00:01:19.470> good<00:01:19.710> weed

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
preparation is concerned as good weed

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.030 
preparation is concerned as good weed
control<00:01:20.189> if<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:21.090> have<00:01:21.299> any<00:01:21.860> perennial<00:01:22.860> weeds

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
control if you have any perennial weeds

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.670 
control if you have any perennial weeds
such<00:01:23.369> as<00:01:23.520> buying<00:01:23.790> weed<00:01:24.090> or<00:01:24.240> Bermuda<00:01:24.720> that<00:01:24.930> may

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
such as buying weed or Bermuda that may

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.200 
such as buying weed or Bermuda that may
take<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:25.979> full<00:01:26.340> year<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.610> get<00:01:26.850> under<00:01:27.060> control

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
take a full year to get under control

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.569 
take a full year to get under control
and<00:01:27.810> so<00:01:28.049> it's<00:01:28.259> important<00:01:28.799> you<00:01:28.829> do<00:01:29.070> that<00:01:29.310> and

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
and so it's important you do that and

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.580 
and so it's important you do that and
then<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.390> third<00:01:30.600> thing<00:01:30.630> is<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:31.079> organic

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
then the third thing is that organic

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.760 
then the third thing is that organic
matter<00:01:32.299> blueberries<00:01:33.299> like<00:01:33.570> lots<00:01:34.320> of<00:01:34.470> organic

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
matter blueberries like lots of organic

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.830 
matter blueberries like lots of organic
matter<00:01:35.100> again<00:01:35.640> do<00:01:35.909> that<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.270> year<00:01:36.450> before<00:01:36.479> you

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
matter again do that the year before you

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.420 
matter again do that the year before you
can<00:01:37.079> build<00:01:37.290> that<00:01:37.500> up<00:01:37.560> so<00:01:37.920> when<00:01:38.100> you're<00:01:38.250> ready

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
can build that up so when you're ready

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.330 
can build that up so when you're ready
to<00:01:38.490> plant<00:01:38.820> that<00:01:39.030> second<00:01:39.509> year<00:01:40.130> everything<00:01:41.130> is

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
to plant that second year everything is

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.700 
to plant that second year everything is
perfect<00:01:41.880> for<00:01:42.030> those<00:01:42.180> plants<00:01:42.540> make<00:01:43.350> sure<00:01:43.560> you

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
perfect for those plants make sure you

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.950 
perfect for those plants make sure you
start<00:01:44.009> with<00:01:44.100> good<00:01:44.520> clean<00:01:44.850> material<00:01:45.090> buy<00:01:45.899> it

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
start with good clean material buy it

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.499 
start with good clean material buy it
