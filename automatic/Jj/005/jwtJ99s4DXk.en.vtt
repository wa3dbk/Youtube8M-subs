00:04:48.839 --> 00:04:48.849 
just like one of my best friends said

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:51.960 
just like one of my best friends said
like<00:04:49.389> on<00:04:49.599> online<00:04:50.020> said<00:04:50.319> my<00:04:51.159> craft<00:04:51.490> could<00:04:51.729> never

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
like on online said my craft could never

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.869 
like on online said my craft could never
be<00:04:52.210> a<00:04:52.389> MLG<00:04:52.659> the<00:04:53.259> only<00:04:53.500> way<00:04:53.620> it<00:04:53.860> can<00:04:53.949> be<00:04:54.069> MLG<00:04:54.669> as

00:04:54.869 --> 00:04:54.879 
be a MLG the only way it can be MLG as

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:56.520 
be a MLG the only way it can be MLG as
if<00:04:55.030> its<00:04:55.210> flex<00:04:55.449> hunger<00:04:55.810> games<00:04:56.020> or<00:04:56.289> spleef

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
if its flex hunger games or spleef

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:57.390 
if its flex hunger games or spleef
that's<00:04:56.740> that's<00:04:56.919> different<00:04:57.250> and<00:04:57.280> because

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
that's that's different and because

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.249 
that's that's different and because
you're<00:04:57.639> going<00:04:57.789> instead<00:04:58.030> other<00:04:58.599> net<00:04:58.810> building

00:04:59.249 --> 00:04:59.259 
you're going instead other net building

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:01.290 
you're going instead other net building
can<00:04:59.440> never<00:04:59.650> be<00:04:59.860> MLG<00:05:00.220> so<00:05:00.430> if<00:05:00.880> someone<00:05:01.150> says

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
can never be MLG so if someone says

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.430 
can never be MLG so if someone says
something<00:05:01.330> about<00:05:01.569> your<00:05:01.750> build<00:05:01.900> that's<00:05:02.229> their

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 
something about your build that's their

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.230 
something about your build that's their
opinion<00:05:02.530> there's<00:05:03.130> 100<00:05:03.490> other<00:05:03.669> people<00:05:03.699> can

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
opinion there's 100 other people can

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.640 
opinion there's 100 other people can
