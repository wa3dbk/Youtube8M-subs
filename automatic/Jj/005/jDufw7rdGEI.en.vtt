00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:58.429
 the only way that has come out is worth 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:00.370
 you come here with franklin another one from 

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:03.800

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:06.020
 $ 200,000 at least since for 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.880

 you give it to confirm and when you are 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.360
 loading the animation you give to 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.730
 upset such pause and we 're going to go to 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.710
 departure and this time we will choose 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:21.890
 repeat mission and very important the 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:25.040

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:31.790
 cinematic we will appear with franklin in 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:34.010
 the map and we can enjoy everything 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.870
 the map for our enjoyment since 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.630
 we will be totally alone there will not be 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.640
 no one on the map will not have pedestrians 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.070
 There will be no cars, we can drive around 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.440
 the streets freely and do what 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.110
 we want and it's a curious clicks 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.490
 I wanted to share with all of you 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.250
 now I'm going to leave you here a little 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.440
 clip that I go with him with the car apart 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.630
 as you are seeing on the map it does not appear 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.780
 no icon or anything appears to me to say 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.670
 we have the totally virgin map for 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.010
 we indicate for us and he prepares 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.680
 to do what you want and how are you 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.660
 watching there is absolutely no one now 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.390
 well that I did I put on the trick of the 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.100
 limousine or you have the videos in the 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.050
 description the last video that is the 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.300
 first video of tricks that I went up grand 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.770
 theft auto 'there are several tricks and 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.900
 one of them is how to get the 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.120
 limousine not because since we're here I 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.360
 say 12 I like the limousine and give me 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.430
 a 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.100
 small walk for the saints to 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.650
 bring this little clip to the video 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.720
 so I said good here what happens 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.630
 all the time that I was giving him a 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.330
 turn quietly 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:41.020
 I did not see absolutely anyone the only thing 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:44.260
 I saw it was an army helicopter but 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:46.060
 let's go the only thing I could see in the 10-15 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.920
 minutes that I was looking through the map 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.350
 see if he found something and did not see 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.180
 absolutely nothing and after all 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:55.300
 this solitude I said good let's see what 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.390
 happens if we activate the trick of the level of 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.740
 police search to see if it appeared 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.720
 obviously if it appeared it appears the 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.580
 police but I put the level of 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.710
 maximum search as you are seeing in 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.120
 five stars and then your level puts you 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.540
 search is the maximum and only me 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.860
 there were three cars and a helicopter 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.110
 but hey, he just did not want 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.580
 leave to leave to finish the video 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.140
 that keeps putting the trick of the 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.750
 Police then obviously appeared born 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.190
 mill, nothing has been everything, I hope 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.660
 that you liked, we'll see you in the 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.660
 next video and until next time
