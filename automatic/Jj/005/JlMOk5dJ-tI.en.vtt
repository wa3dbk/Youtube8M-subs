00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:07.410
 no year passes by now without one 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.210
 expect new need for speed 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.550
 we from ravels are called as the new part 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.259
 was solid action but no 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.269
 Quantum leaps, at least playfully 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.070
 technically, on the other hand, it is very well 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.770
 after all, it is a small jump in it 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.140
 like the first exchange for speed 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.180
 the db title of the newly founded ea 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.350
 developer studios close games power 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.350
 we betray now 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.190
 just like in need for speed hot pursuit 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.110
 we can move freely in ravels 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.180
 and accepting challenges of 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.550
 passable state high street view 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.360
 county and offers varied and 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.890
 worthy environments for rapid 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.530
 chase at the beginning we look for each other 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.150
 a side of basket or razor we 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.129
 later change again at any time 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.690
 The campaigns can run up 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:55.640
 both sides are about the same as us 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.860
 get a bunch of things to do 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.500
 tasks get applied for it 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:06.440
 level ascents and new license cars in the 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:08.240
 shop and so on getting ahead 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.460
 But we have points with which we 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.619
 first, as a raser the chic carts 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.710
 from the shop and secondly 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:17.690
 These then also to lust and mood 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.460
 to upgrade with upgrades for 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:23.420
 speed and acceleration about 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:26.090
 and with weapons upgrades about bmps or 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.280
 Shock waves are important weapons before 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.860
 after all, it is all for police work 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.430
 it is often the task on this page 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:36.000
 destroy the cart of the carabiner 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.980
 Yes 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.140
 a little bit underground 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:42.450
 Also in Ravel things like the paint 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.850
 and the rims we can at will 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.080
 dye 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.910
 but we will be careful of the 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.280
 law enforcement caught that is 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:52.410
 a guy in the police car ensures that 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.180
 our car breaks what's over 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.860
 a damaged bar is displayed 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.200
 Although we may right back to the 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.690
 asphalt the points collected so far 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.640
 but then we are fresh therefore we have 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.770
 in vence with many points behind us 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.080
 first through a gas station drive the 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.959
 repaired cars automatically and stood 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.900
 necessarily to the next hide or to 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:19.170
 police could the operational center otherwise 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:21.120
 so what happens to your theme multiplayer 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.580
 levels is designed in that way 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.900
 ideally always some real opponents 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.610
 traveling in the county 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.860
 These are on the card with one 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.780
 Green circle marked around them 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.320
 computer-controlled fibers differ 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.060
 to be able to 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.340
 accordingly, the game is too 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.870
 no time really passable who one 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.400
 Pause or play the game 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.830
 should want to finish before hiding 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.630
 drive the new all drive technology 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.340
 should make sure that always one 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.780
 handful of friends without a lobby 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.880
 knickknack in the world on the way 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.459
 we want to run against the one 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.810
 let's just catch them and 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:54.150
 ask by pressing a button 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.590
 it is also already going on the advantage 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.299
 Real opponents often offer more 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.250
 challenges as the typical need 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:02.420
 for speed rubber band 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.420
 There are also more points at the end 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.670
 on the pc comes the battlefield engine 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.770
 frostbite three very well 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.170
 leaves over the asphalt 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.690
 raindrops over the roof because it's so 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.550
 nice it even mostly in the sun and the 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.170
 all lenz many effects would be self 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.000
 to make a michael bay proud 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.590
 but the thing on the 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.160
 pc limited electronic arts the 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:29.530
 frame rate at 30 are constant 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.630
 but significantly more would have been possible 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.760
 also be a disadvantage steering wheels 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.380
 not supported as input devices 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.959
 on the nextgen consoles here 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.489
 representative because the xbox version 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:41.530
 is a similar picture from how on 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:43.840
 the pc only the treppchen education seems 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.319
 For this a little more restless play too 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.510
 to care 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:48.910
 but on the whole the game is the same 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.470
 pretty as on the pc what you get from the 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.610
 for the core engine version 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.769
 can not say 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.720
 they look partially badly pixelated 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:58.540
 that there was earlier times prettier 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.880
 So who has the choice should go to pc or 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.380
 next version access sound page 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.440
 however, all versions offer the same thing 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:09.450
 picture a good engine noise popping 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.450
 just like the licensed soundtrack 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.560
 Need for speed series offers what you get from 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.720
 need for speed today 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.760
 exciting raser versus koop action with 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.320
 a nice open world with 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.600
 simulation has nothing to do with more 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.920
 Absolutely nothing on the hat to steer yourself 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.780
 to recognize the bolides and the 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.760
 artificial intelligence is much too 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.590
 rubber band like compared to hot 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.190
 pursuit makes it a small step 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.780
 forward 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.360
 This is partly due to the good 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:43.800
 multiplayer integration and tuning 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.800
 and personalization options 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.970
 here
