go to sleep if you space it out you will

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.440 
go to sleep if you space it out you will
learn<00:02:46.290> and<00:02:46.530> retain<00:02:46.709> much<00:02:47.310> more<00:02:47.610> later<00:02:47.910> than<00:02:48.269> if

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
learn and retain much more later than if

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.569 
learn and retain much more later than if
you<00:02:48.570> do<00:02:48.720> mass<00:02:48.989> practice<00:02:49.650> we<00:02:50.040> return<00:02:50.370> to<00:02:50.400> the

you do mass practice we return to the

the best ways to learn is actually by

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.059 
the best ways to learn is actually by
testing<00:03:51.420> yourself<00:03:51.510> testing<00:03:52.080> it<00:03:52.230> re<00:03:52.560> exposes

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:54.410 
testing yourself testing it re exposes
you<00:03:53.190> to<00:03:53.220> the<00:03:53.430> information<00:03:53.790> in<00:03:54.090> a<00:03:54.150> way<00:03:54.180> it's

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
you to the information in a way it's

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.210 
you to the information in a way it's
even<00:03:54.750> better<00:03:54.900> if<00:03:55.110> you<00:03:55.200> do<00:03:55.319> it<00:03:55.349> with<00:03:55.530> feedback

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
even better if you do it with feedback

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.680 
even better if you do it with feedback
even<00:03:56.370> testing<00:03:56.670> without<00:03:56.730> feedback<00:03:57.120> seems<00:03:57.510> to

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
even testing without feedback seems to

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.510 
even testing without feedback seems to
work<00:03:57.810> pretty<00:03:57.990> well<00:03:58.140> and<00:03:58.500> then<00:03:58.560> you're<00:03:59.340> also

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520 
work pretty well and then you're also

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.400 
work pretty well and then you're also
getting<00:03:59.820> practice<00:04:00.480> in<00:04:00.750> what<00:04:01.080> you're<00:04:01.230> going<00:04:01.350> to

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
getting practice in what you're going to

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.380 
getting practice in what you're going to
have<00:04:01.590> to<00:04:01.710> do<00:04:01.800> on<00:04:01.920> the<00:04:02.010> test<00:04:02.040> which<00:04:02.430> is<00:04:02.490> retrieve

have to do on the test which is retrieve

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.900 
have to do on the test which is retrieve
the<00:04:03.600> information<00:04:03.870> most<00:04:04.800> of<00:04:05.040> us<00:04:05.160> can't<00:04:05.490> really

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
the information most of us can't really

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.180 
the information most of us can't really
focus<00:04:06.120> attention<00:04:06.720> more<00:04:07.230> than<00:04:07.260> 10<00:04:07.770> or<00:04:07.800> 12

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
focus attention more than 10 or 12

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.490 
focus attention more than 10 or 12
minutes<00:04:08.610> our<00:04:09.180> brains<00:04:09.390> are<00:04:09.630> novelty<00:04:10.110> seekers

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
minutes our brains are novelty seekers

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.310 
minutes our brains are novelty seekers
and<00:04:10.800> so<00:04:11.340> we<00:04:12.270> have<00:04:12.420> to<00:04:12.570> do<00:04:12.690> something<00:04:12.930> to<00:04:13.200> keep

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
and so we have to do something to keep

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.009

them<00:04:13.590> fresh<00:04:14.070> take<00:04:14.670> breaks<00:04:15.090> you<00:04:15.540> work<00:04:15.780> out<00:04:15.990> a
