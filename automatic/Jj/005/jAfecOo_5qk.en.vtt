00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:12.540
 hello everyone with you again dmitry kovalev 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.950
 and welcome you to the second video 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.420
 tutorials on using boot 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.100
 flash drives in which I will teach with two 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.050
 ways to deceive the parent 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.369
 control in windows 7 the first way is 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.270
 simple time translation in bios 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.250
 motherboard 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.600
 This method works only when 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.699
 you have user access in 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.810
 any particular time if 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.250
 parental control completely 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.810
 blocks access to the user then 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.830
 here the second way will help us 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.969
 so user using 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.170
 bootable flash drive 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.090
 Now we move on to the first method. 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.890
 so-called parental walk 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.629
 control for this open access to 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.809
 to our user 7 to 8 am at 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.809
 Monday 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.190
 check the time limit 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.870
 installed but know when we have 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.699
 user access we can translate 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.120
 date and time in bios and unimpeded 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.129
 to come in 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.690
 I decided to complicate our task a little 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.850
 put quite bios which now 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.590
 I will teach you to shoot it because 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.210
 almost always when the parent is put 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.040
 control parents also put a password on 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.760
 bios so that their children do not translate time 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.500
 sat endlessly at the computer and so 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.990
 to remove the bios password we need 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.380
 simple and Phillips screwdriver 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.259
 the screwdriver does not remove the case cover 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.970
 simple take out the battery also to 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.080
 knock down settings can be closed with a screwdriver 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.460
 two of these sweaters 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.960
 but I think that the first method is where 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:31.200
 safer so just you don't 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:32.850
 the battery the battery can and with whom everything 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.650
 for five minutes after which we repeat everything 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.780
 actions in reverse order and go in 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.759
 bios here go to the standart tab 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.439
 By Moscow time, he named him the date and time for that 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.049
 which corresponds to monday seven 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.149
 o'clock in the morning the only precaution 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.380
 which should respect this 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.149
 do not translate date forward or backward 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.290
 more than a week so how can 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.250
 having problems with some 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.409
 programs 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.670
 Internet services such as their own 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.439
 experience I can say that when you try 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.210
 run any google services with 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.979
 wrong date set he will write 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.469
 100 certificate or not yet released 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.329
 either already expired so after 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:06.030
 we transferred time saving settings 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:09.950
 go windows click on our 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.950
 username and log in 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.760
 with the translation time sorted out and 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.770
 Now let's talk about how to get 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.370
 user access if login is denied 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.860
 any time 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.600
 or we don't know which one exactly how I already 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.640
 said here will help us studied flash drive 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.830
 windows 7 creation lesson you can 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.420
 find on my channel after switching to 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.390
 boot flash drive run the program 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:39.230
 to work with users and choose 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:43.060
 drive where windows is 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:47.380
 and choose the user we need 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:50.000
 remove the checkboxes and set the login time 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:53.800
 as you can see we can only enter 7 to 8 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.030
 hours on monday let's fix this 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.290
 I advise you to remove these ticks every time 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.489
 when you finish working with 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.040
 user so as not to aggravate 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:03.640
 situation with your parents after 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:07.970
 as we ticked off press ok and 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:10.610
 keep everything ready now go 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.440
 back windows after running windows 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.200
 as usual we enter the password opened throws 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.880
 on this note we will complete our video lesson 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.750
 by cheating and hacking parental control 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.670
 windows 7 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.410
 and remember it was recorded in order to 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.850
 spent days playing it to 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.019
 you had more time which you 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.239
 can spend on something useful 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:27.980
 dmitry yakovlev didn't work for you 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.900
 forget to subscribe to my channel so 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.110
