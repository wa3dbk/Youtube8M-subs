 surely you have not been born but you have not 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.380
 Worry about this, ask for a solution. I'm going to 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:42.410
 teach that it's a churro and it's more I'm going 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:45.610

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.610
 easy easy easy 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.760
 what we need is two cups of 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.309
 flour that is approximately 250 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.200
 grams 60 grams of butter that 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:00.940
 approximately are 4 tablespoons 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.809
 to sugar 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.809
 cinnamon 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.439
 salt and vanilla 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.670
 we will also occupy a liter of oil 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.770
 to fry our churros and also 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.840
 a confectionery syringe or in your 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.880
 defect one sleeve the only thing 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.190
 we need are this kind of nozzles 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.990
 and if not with a bag of those that 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.790
 we use for sandwiches you 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:31.100
 we can make a cut to the shore 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:34.470
 We will boil a cup and a half of 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.750
 water and we will add the butter 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.370
 is going to melt and combine and goes to 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.280
 be more or less as a broth 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:43.880
 chicken in my case we are going to place the two 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.880
 Cups of Flour 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.810
 we will add a little salt to the mixture 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:58.409
 we add the water with butter 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.409
 we did at the beginning and we revolve 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.030
 to finish we will add only 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.030
 a teaspoon of vanilla 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:13.230
 It's time to fry watch how I do it 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.230
 in the video so you can imitate it 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.210
 once it is ready we are going to 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.540
 sprinkle it with a mixture of cinnamon 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.540
 and sugar 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.750
 now I recommend a drink for 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.540
 accompany them what we need is 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.240
 one liter of milk and one or two tablets 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.680
 of chocolate depending on the 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.810
 chocolatosa what do you want it to be 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.850
 drink and basically we're going to 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.280
 let the milk warm and free 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.640
 the chocolate and ready 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.640
