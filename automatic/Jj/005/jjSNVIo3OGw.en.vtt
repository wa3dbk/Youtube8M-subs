00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
to loop your cube with this stuff three

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.370 
to loop your cube with this stuff three
and<00:00:07.440> one<00:00:07.470> professional<00:00:08.220> silicon<00:00:08.639> lubricant

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:09.380 
and one professional silicon lubricant

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.140 
and one professional silicon lubricant
made<00:00:10.380> by<00:00:10.500> the<00:00:10.559> same<00:00:10.679> people<00:00:10.830> as<00:00:11.219> wd-40<00:00:11.969> it's

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
made by the same people as wd-40 it's

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.120 
made by the same people as wd-40 it's
not<00:00:12.240> wd-40<00:00:12.990> though<00:00:13.110> so<00:00:13.469> don't<00:00:13.799> get<00:00:13.950> confused

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
not wd-40 though so don't get confused

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.150 
not wd-40 though so don't get confused
as<00:00:14.549> such<00:00:15.139> I've<00:00:16.139> tried<00:00:16.289> some<00:00:16.500> other<00:00:16.650> lubes<00:00:16.920> I've

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
as such I've tried some other lubes I've

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.679 
as such I've tried some other lubes I've
tried<00:00:17.490> mineral<00:00:18.240> oil<00:00:18.500> jiggle<00:00:19.500> ooh<00:00:20.480> wd-40<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:21.510> I

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
tried mineral oil jiggle ooh wd-40 and I

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.140 
tried mineral oil jiggle ooh wd-40 and I
think<00:00:21.869> another<00:00:22.050> light<00:00:22.380> oil<00:00:22.410> in<00:00:22.830> there<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.250> if

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
think another light oil in there and if

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.880 
think another light oil in there and if
I<00:00:24.269> none<00:00:24.510> of<00:00:24.630> them<00:00:24.750> really<00:00:25.140> worked<00:00:25.500> as<00:00:25.680> well<00:00:25.830> as

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
I none of them really worked as well as

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.609 
I none of them really worked as well as
this<00:00:26.430> stuff<00:00:26.670> so<00:00:27.480> this<00:00:27.810> is<00:00:27.960> what<00:00:28.109> i<00:00:28.140> use<00:00:28.199> almost

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
this stuff so this is what i use almost

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.109 
this stuff so this is what i use almost
exclusively<00:00:29.250> i<00:00:29.310> haven't<00:00:29.609> tried<00:00:29.760> any<00:00:29.970> other

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
exclusively i haven't tried any other

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.479 
exclusively i haven't tried any other
silicon<00:00:30.599> lubricant<00:00:31.109> so<00:00:31.320> so<00:00:31.619> if<00:00:31.769> you<00:00:31.859> have<00:00:31.949> crc

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
silicon lubricant so so if you have crc

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.610 
silicon lubricant so so if you have crc
or<00:00:32.730> some<00:00:33.719> other<00:00:33.840> stuff<00:00:34.110> it<00:00:34.290> should<00:00:34.410> work<00:00:34.530> just

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
or some other stuff it should work just

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.869 
or some other stuff it should work just
as<00:00:34.920> well<00:00:35.480> i<00:00:36.680> really<00:00:37.680> never<00:00:37.980> had<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.250> cube<00:00:38.579> ever

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
as well i really never had a cube ever

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.750 
as well i really never had a cube ever
that<00:00:39.809> didn't<00:00:40.200> respond<00:00:40.590> well<00:00:40.860> after<00:00:41.309> lubing<00:00:41.640> it

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
that didn't respond well after lubing it

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.369 
that didn't respond well after lubing it
with<00:00:41.910> this<00:00:42.030> stuff<00:00:43.040> it's<00:00:44.040> almost<00:00:44.250> always

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:45.379 
with this stuff it's almost always

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:48.770 
with this stuff it's almost always
noticeably<00:00:46.670> smoother<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:47.879> takes<00:00:48.360> much<00:00:48.570> less

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
noticeably smoother and takes much less

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.680 
noticeably smoother and takes much less
much<00:00:49.469> less<00:00:49.500> effort<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.280> make<00:00:50.399> turns<00:00:50.700> there's

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
much less effort to make turns there's

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.689 
much less effort to make turns there's
only<00:00:51.870> like<00:00:51.960> one<00:00:52.110> cube<00:00:52.739> I<00:00:52.949> had<00:00:53.190> that<00:00:53.430> really

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
only like one cube I had that really

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.060 
only like one cube I had that really
didn't<00:00:54.170> respond<00:00:55.170> well<00:00:55.379> that<00:00:55.530> didn't<00:00:55.739> respond

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
didn't respond well that didn't respond

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.099 
didn't respond well that didn't respond
to<00:00:56.129> like<00:00:56.340> any<00:00:56.550> lube<00:00:56.820> it<00:00:57.030> was<00:00:57.300> just<00:00:57.629> crap<00:00:57.930> is

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
to like any lube it was just crap is

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.290 
to like any lube it was just crap is
Type<00:00:58.379> B<00:00:58.410> so<00:00:59.030> yeah<00:01:00.030> as<00:01:00.989> for<00:01:01.320> as<00:01:01.530> far<00:01:02.430> as<00:01:02.670> actual

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
Type B so yeah as for as far as actual

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.359 
Type B so yeah as for as far as actual
lubricating<00:01:03.899> method<00:01:04.199> goes<00:01:04.409> I'll<00:01:04.860> get<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.339> that

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
lubricating method goes I'll get to that

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.120 
lubricating method goes I'll get to that
in<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.700> sec<00:01:06.060> one<00:01:07.049> of<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.200> most<00:01:07.350> common<00:01:07.770> ways<00:01:07.920> to

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
in a sec one of the most common ways to

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.830 
in a sec one of the most common ways to
do<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.400> is<00:01:09.890> put<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:10.979> little<00:01:11.159> strong<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.880> then

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
do it is put the little strong and then

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.179 
do it is put the little strong and then
pop<00:01:13.439> out<00:01:13.619> an<00:01:13.770> edge<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.250> cube<00:01:16.159> spray<00:01:17.159> a

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
pop out an edge of the cube spray a

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.730 
pop out an edge of the cube spray a
little<00:01:17.340> lube<00:01:18.119> on<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.810> edges<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.229> around<00:01:19.619> the

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
little lube on the edges and around the

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.859 
little lube on the edges and around the
parts<00:01:20.009> you<00:01:20.100> just<00:01:20.310> popped<00:01:20.490> out<00:01:20.729> put<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.750> edge

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
parts you just popped out put the edge

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.359 
parts you just popped out put the edge
back<00:01:22.110> in<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.500> do<00:01:22.560> that<00:01:22.710> for<00:01:22.860> another<00:01:23.070> maybe

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
back in and do that for another maybe

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.870 
back in and do that for another maybe
three<00:01:23.909> or<00:01:23.939> six<00:01:24.600> edges<00:01:25.049> or<00:01:25.500> three<00:01:26.280> or<00:01:26.400> five<00:01:26.580> so

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
three or six edges or three or five so

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.130 
three or six edges or three or five so
you<00:01:26.939> have<00:01:27.090> either<00:01:27.210> four<00:01:27.509> or<00:01:27.570> six<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.049> then

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
you have either four or six and then

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.469 
you have either four or six and then
work<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.369> stuff<00:01:29.579> in<00:01:29.790> but<00:01:29.970> that's<00:01:30.119> not<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.390> way

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
work the stuff in but that's not the way

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.109 
work the stuff in but that's not the way
I<00:01:30.509> do<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:30.930> I<00:01:31.100> fully<00:01:32.100> disassembled<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.790> queue

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
I do it I fully disassembled the queue

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.870 
I do it I fully disassembled the queue
so<00:01:33.720> I'm<00:01:34.680> going<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:34.890> go<00:01:35.009> ahead<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.250> do<00:01:35.460> that<00:01:35.490> and

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
so I'm going to go ahead and do that and

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.429 
so I'm going to go ahead and do that and
I'm<00:01:36.119> going<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.329> cut<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.780> we'll<00:01:36.900> be<00:01:36.990> back<00:01:37.170> when

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
I'm going to cut and we'll be back when

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.140 
I'm going to cut and we'll be back when
I<00:01:37.470> have<00:01:37.650> my<00:01:37.829> cube<00:01:38.070> fully<00:01:38.340> disassembled<00:01:38.970> and

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
I have my cube fully disassembled and

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.140 
I have my cube fully disassembled and
lined<00:01:39.360> up<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:39.659> ready<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:39.930> move<00:01:40.939> now<00:01:41.939> as<00:01:42.090> you

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
lined up and ready to move now as you

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.850 
lined up and ready to move now as you
can<00:01:42.270> see<00:01:42.329> I<00:01:42.420> have<00:01:42.600> my<00:01:42.720> cube<00:01:43.049> disassembled<00:01:43.710> then

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
can see I have my cube disassembled then

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.190 
can see I have my cube disassembled then
lined<00:01:44.070> up<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.399> ready<00:01:44.460> for<00:01:44.820> lube<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.990> core<00:01:46.170> I

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
lined up and ready for lube the core I

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.990 
lined up and ready for lube the core I
don't<00:01:46.560> move<00:01:46.770> so<00:01:47.100> I'm<00:01:47.460> just<00:01:47.610> going<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:47.790> put<00:01:47.880> that

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
don't move so I'm just going to put that

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.630 
don't move so I'm just going to put that
aside<00:01:48.240> while<00:01:48.570> I<00:01:48.600> do<00:01:48.720> this<00:01:49.220> as<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.399> can<00:01:50.490> see

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.550 
aside while I do this as you can see
they're<00:01:50.850> all<00:01:50.939> lined<00:01:51.270> up<00:01:51.479> nicely<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.170> I<00:01:52.380> don't

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
they're all lined up nicely and I don't

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.170 
they're all lined up nicely and I don't
just<00:01:52.710> do<00:01:52.829> that<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:53.040> be<00:01:53.159> neat<00:01:53.520> there's<00:01:53.820> actually

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
just do that to be neat there's actually

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.359 
just do that to be neat there's actually
a<00:01:54.210> purpose<00:01:54.750> in<00:01:54.899> that<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:55.320> if<00:01:56.189> you'll<00:01:56.340> notice

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
a purpose in that and if you'll notice

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.819 
a purpose in that and if you'll notice
the<00:01:56.700> way<00:01:56.820> they're<00:01:57.030> lined<00:01:57.240> up<00:01:57.450> I<00:01:57.659> have<00:01:58.229> for<00:01:58.740> the

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
the way they're lined up I have for the

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.190 
the way they're lined up I have for the
edge<00:01:58.920> pieces<00:01:59.219> I<00:01:59.460> above<00:01:59.700> all<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.540> stickered

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
edge pieces I above all the stickered

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.039 
edge pieces I above all the stickered
faces<00:02:01.619> down<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.219> pointing<00:02:02.729> that<00:02:02.850> way<00:02:03.060> for<00:02:04.020> the

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
faces down and pointing that way for the

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.109 
faces down and pointing that way for the
corner<00:02:04.380> pieces<00:02:04.590> I<00:02:04.979> have<00:02:05.640> all<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:05.850> sticker

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
corner pieces I have all the sticker

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.600 
corner pieces I have all the sticker
faces<00:02:06.540> pointing<00:02:06.840> down<00:02:07.110> and<00:02:07.439> mostly<00:02:08.129> forward

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
faces pointing down and mostly forward

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.219 
faces pointing down and mostly forward
and<00:02:09.060> that's<00:02:09.239> how<00:02:09.360> I<00:02:09.390> can<00:02:09.599> spray<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.959> lube<00:02:10.110> on

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
and that's how I can spray the lube on

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.600 
and that's how I can spray the lube on
one<00:02:10.470> side<00:02:10.709> and<00:02:10.950> not<00:02:11.009> have<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.340> worry<00:02:11.370> about

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
one side and not have to worry about

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.790 
one side and not have to worry about
spraying<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.360> lube<00:02:12.510> all

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
spraying the lube all

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.280 
spraying the lube all
the<00:02:12.980> sticker<00:02:13.220> pieces<00:02:13.930> so<00:02:14.930> I'm<00:02:14.990> going<00:02:15.140> to<00:02:15.170> go

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
the sticker pieces so I'm going to go

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.280 
the sticker pieces so I'm going to go
ahead<00:02:15.320> and<00:02:15.530> do<00:02:15.740> that<00:02:15.770> I<00:02:16.130> usually<00:02:16.430> I<00:02:16.850> try<00:02:17.690> not<00:02:18.230> to

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
ahead and do that I usually I try not to

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.620 
ahead and do that I usually I try not to
press<00:02:18.620> it<00:02:18.770> down<00:02:18.800> full<00:02:19.430> strength<00:02:19.790> and<00:02:20.060> I<00:02:20.420> don't

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
press it down full strength and I don't

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.990 
press it down full strength and I don't
use<00:02:20.870> this<00:02:21.020> draw<00:02:21.260> either<00:02:21.500> i<00:02:21.650> find<00:02:22.010> i<00:02:22.130> get<00:02:22.310> better

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
use this draw either i find i get better

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.630 
use this draw either i find i get better
atomization<00:02:23.540> of<00:02:24.050> the<00:02:24.470> spray<00:02:24.980> so<00:02:25.160> it's<00:02:25.280> a<00:02:25.340> nicer

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
atomization of the spray so it's a nicer

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.910 
atomization of the spray so it's a nicer
missed<00:02:26.030> without<00:02:26.450> this<00:02:26.630> draw<00:02:26.840> so<00:02:27.530> basically<00:02:27.830> I

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
missed without this draw so basically I

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.380 
missed without this draw so basically I
come<00:02:28.220> in<00:02:28.370> and<00:02:28.900> I<00:02:29.900> spray<00:02:30.260> as<00:02:30.470> such<00:02:31.270> might<00:02:32.270> have

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
come in and I spray as such might have

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.230 
come in and I spray as such might have
to<00:02:32.540> move<00:02:32.660> around<00:02:32.810> here<00:02:33.550> so<00:02:34.550> I'll<00:02:34.670> come<00:02:34.940> in<00:02:35.060> and

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
to move around here so I'll come in and

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:40.720 
to move around here so I'll come in and
kind<00:02:35.630> of<00:02:35.780> spray<00:02:36.050> these<00:02:36.320> faces<00:02:39.430> come<00:02:40.430> in<00:02:40.550> from

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
kind of spray these faces come in from

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.160 
kind of spray these faces come in from
the<00:02:40.850> other<00:02:40.910> side<00:02:41.030> get<00:02:41.630> the<00:02:41.750> other<00:02:41.900> faces<00:02:44.170> once

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
the other side get the other faces once

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.630 
the other side get the other faces once
from<00:02:45.410> the<00:02:45.440> top<00:02:45.590> and<00:02:48.010> then<00:02:49.010> move<00:02:49.220> on<00:02:49.370> to<00:02:49.490> the

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
from the top and then move on to the

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:50.950 
from the top and then move on to the
edge<00:02:49.760> pieces<00:02:50.030> I'm<00:02:50.300> going<00:02:50.510> to<00:02:50.570> spray<00:02:50.720> it<00:02:50.840> in

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:50.960 
edge pieces I'm going to spray it in

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.220 
edge pieces I'm going to spray it in
that<00:02:51.170> direction<00:02:51.740> instead<00:02:52.100> of<00:02:52.700> in<00:02:52.820> this<00:02:53.360> manner

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
that direction instead of in this manner

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.250 
that direction instead of in this manner
so<00:02:54.920> that<00:02:54.950> it<00:02:55.730> doesn't<00:02:56.000> get<00:02:56.450> the<00:02:56.630> front<00:02:57.020> edges

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
so that it doesn't get the front edges

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:03.559 
so that it doesn't get the front edges
where<00:02:57.590> the<00:02:57.710> stickers<00:02:58.040> are<00:02:58.570> I'll<00:02:59.570> come<00:02:59.750> in<00:02:59.870> here

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:08.500 

this<00:03:04.140> is<00:03:04.230> difficult<00:03:04.499> so<00:03:05.129> close<00:03:05.370> to<00:03:05.519> the<00:03:05.609> floor

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.679 

maybe<00:03:09.510> get<00:03:09.719> a<00:03:09.749> little<00:03:09.810> on<00:03:10.109> top<00:03:10.379> as<00:03:10.650> well<00:03:10.829> and

00:03:11.679 --> 00:03:11.689 
maybe get a little on top as well and

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:13.940 
maybe get a little on top as well and
I'll<00:03:12.689> turn<00:03:12.930> them<00:03:13.049> around<00:03:13.200> and<00:03:13.530> do<00:03:13.590> it<00:03:13.709> for<00:03:13.859> the

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
I'll turn them around and do it for the

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:20.839 
I'll turn them around and do it for the
other<00:03:14.099> side<00:03:18.650> and<00:03:19.650> there<00:03:19.769> you<00:03:19.859> go<00:03:19.920> that's<00:03:20.700> all

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:20.849 
other side and there you go that's all

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:22.309 
other side and there you go that's all
you<00:03:20.939> need<00:03:21.060> to<00:03:21.150> do<00:03:21.269> now<00:03:21.689> you<00:03:21.750> need<00:03:21.959> to<00:03:21.989> let<00:03:22.170> it

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
you need to do now you need to let it

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:23.750 
you need to do now you need to let it
dry<00:03:22.349> and<00:03:22.739> the<00:03:22.829> drawing<00:03:23.099> part<00:03:23.340> is<00:03:23.579> very

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
dry and the drawing part is very

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.009 
dry and the drawing part is very
important<00:03:25.670> the<00:03:26.670> mistake<00:03:27.030> I<00:03:27.239> head<00:03:27.599> and<00:03:27.810> a<00:03:27.870> lot

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
important the mistake I head and a lot

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:29.990 
important the mistake I head and a lot
of<00:03:28.049> other<00:03:28.260> people<00:03:28.469> had<00:03:28.889> when<00:03:29.099> using<00:03:29.639> this<00:03:29.730> lube

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
of other people had when using this lube

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.789 
of other people had when using this lube
is<00:03:30.180> that<00:03:30.359> they<00:03:30.870> sprayed<00:03:31.169> it<00:03:31.319> in<00:03:31.439> and<00:03:31.739> then

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
is that they sprayed it in and then

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:34.670 
is that they sprayed it in and then
expected<00:03:32.609> the<00:03:33.510> liquid<00:03:34.049> to<00:03:34.079> do<00:03:34.260> the<00:03:34.379> work<00:03:34.530> and

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
expected the liquid to do the work and

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:35.959 
expected the liquid to do the work and
it's<00:03:34.799> not<00:03:34.980> the<00:03:35.129> liquid<00:03:35.430> that<00:03:35.519> does<00:03:35.700> it<00:03:35.849> work

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:35.969 
it's not the liquid that does it work

00:03:35.969 --> 00:03:37.940 
it's not the liquid that does it work
don't<00:03:36.689> make<00:03:36.900> that<00:03:37.079> mistake<00:03:37.230> it's<00:03:37.620> not<00:03:37.769> the

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
don't make that mistake it's not the

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.619 
don't make that mistake it's not the
liquid<00:03:38.250> you<00:03:38.669> want<00:03:38.849> to<00:03:38.939> let<00:03:39.060> it<00:03:39.090> dry<00:03:39.180> because

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:39.629 
liquid you want to let it dry because

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:43.099 
liquid you want to let it dry because
it's<00:03:39.930> the<00:03:40.319> thin<00:03:40.590> film<00:03:40.620> of<00:03:41.159> I<00:03:42.150> guess<00:03:42.389> silicon<00:03:42.930> of

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109 
it's the thin film of I guess silicon of

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:44.270 
it's the thin film of I guess silicon of
these<00:03:43.230> behind<00:03:43.620> that's<00:03:43.949> going<00:03:44.099> to<00:03:44.159> make

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
these behind that's going to make

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.699 
these behind that's going to make
everything<00:03:44.669> smooth<00:03:45.180> so<00:03:46.019> I'm<00:03:46.349> actually<00:03:46.500> going

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
everything smooth so I'm actually going

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.530 
everything smooth so I'm actually going
to<00:03:46.859> head<00:03:47.040> to<00:03:47.069> bed<00:03:47.189> and<00:03:47.609> let<00:03:48.180> this<00:03:48.299> dry

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
to head to bed and let this dry

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.089 
to head to bed and let this dry
overnight<00:03:48.840> that's<00:03:49.199> a<00:03:49.290> way<00:03:49.439> I<00:03:49.469> usually<00:03:49.739> do<00:03:50.010> it

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:50.099 
overnight that's a way I usually do it

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:51.979 
overnight that's a way I usually do it
when<00:03:50.219> i<00:03:50.280> move<00:03:50.459> my<00:03:50.489> cubes<00:03:50.879> and<00:03:51.239> then<00:03:51.269> i'll<00:03:51.870> be

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
when i move my cubes and then i'll be

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:53.500 
when i move my cubes and then i'll be
back<00:03:52.139> in<00:03:52.349> the<00:03:52.409> morning<00:03:52.439> for<00:03:52.919> the<00:03:53.040> next<00:03:53.219> part

back in the morning for the next part
where<00:03:54.510> I<00:03:54.540> put<00:03:54.750> the<00:03:54.900> cube<00:03:55.079> back<00:03:55.230> together<00:03:55.560> so

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:55.889 
where I put the cube back together so

where I put the cube back together so
I'll<00:03:55.980> see<00:03:56.159> you<00:03:56.219> then<00:03:57.530> alright<00:03:58.530> I'm<00:03:58.650> back<00:03:58.709> it's

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
have to leave it for that long a few

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.800 
have to leave it for that long a few
hours<00:04:04.769> usually<00:04:05.159> does<00:04:05.519> but<00:04:05.549> I<00:04:06.060> was<00:04:06.449> comfortably

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
asleep so all the liquid is mostly

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.379 
asleep so all the liquid is mostly
evaporated<00:04:11.430> there's<00:04:11.609> still<00:04:11.790> a<00:04:11.819> few<00:04:12.090> drops

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:12.389 
evaporated there's still a few drops

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:15.129 
evaporated there's still a few drops
left<00:04:12.509> so<00:04:12.810> I'm<00:04:12.930> going<00:04:13.229> to<00:04:13.259> do<00:04:13.409> is<00:04:13.620> a<00:04:13.650> wipe<00:04:14.579> off

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:15.139 
left so I'm going to do is a wipe off

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:18.020 
left so I'm going to do is a wipe off
just<00:04:16.139> give<00:04:16.289> it<00:04:16.440> each<00:04:16.650> QB<00:04:17.099> a<00:04:17.130> little<00:04:17.430> wipe<00:04:17.820> off

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
just give it each QB a little wipe off

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.460 
just give it each QB a little wipe off
to<00:04:18.239> get<00:04:18.359> rid<00:04:18.509> of<00:04:18.599> that<00:04:18.659> because<00:04:18.959> i<00:04:19.079> like<00:04:19.259> it<00:04:19.380> to

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
to get rid of that because i like it to

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.050 
to get rid of that because i like it to
be<00:04:19.560> perfectly<00:04:19.979> dry<00:04:20.250> could<00:04:20.459> probably<00:04:20.609> just<00:04:20.849> put

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
be perfectly dry could probably just put

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.879 
be perfectly dry could probably just put
it<00:04:21.150> back<00:04:21.329> with<00:04:21.630> some<00:04:22.049> liquid<00:04:22.380> in<00:04:22.409> there<00:04:22.650> but

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 
it back with some liquid in there but

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:26.360 
it back with some liquid in there but
doesn't<00:04:23.699> really<00:04:23.820> matter<00:04:24.060> i<00:04:25.009> also<00:04:26.009> didn't

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
doesn't really matter i also didn't

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.089 
doesn't really matter i also didn't
really<00:04:26.550> explain<00:04:26.909> before<00:04:27.449> why<00:04:27.659> I<00:04:27.690> don't<00:04:28.169> just

00:04:29.089 --> 00:04:29.099 
really explain before why I don't just

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:31.850 
really explain before why I don't just
pop<00:04:29.370> corners<00:04:29.789> and<00:04:29.909> spray<00:04:30.180> it<00:04:30.210> in<00:04:30.419> and<00:04:30.630> I<00:04:31.620> did

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
pop corners and spray it in and I did

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.710 
pop corners and spray it in and I did
that<00:04:31.979> a<00:04:32.009> few<00:04:32.130> times<00:04:32.340> that<00:04:32.699> I<00:04:32.820> found<00:04:33.120> unless

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
that a few times that I found unless

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.830 
that a few times that I found unless
you're<00:04:33.900> using<00:04:34.169> something<00:04:34.560> to<00:04:35.539> make<00:04:36.539> it<00:04:36.690> dry

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
you're using something to make it dry

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.570 
you're using something to make it dry
faster<00:04:37.289> like<00:04:37.470> a<00:04:37.500> hair<00:04:37.770> dryer<00:04:38.039> it<00:04:38.280> usually

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
faster like a hair dryer it usually

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.879 
faster like a hair dryer it usually
takes<00:04:38.849> a<00:04:38.970> lot<00:04:39.360> longer<00:04:39.630> to<00:04:39.840> dry<00:04:40.169> like<00:04:40.620> if<00:04:40.800> you

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:40.889 
takes a lot longer to dry like if you

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:42.649 
takes a lot longer to dry like if you
just<00:04:41.099> let<00:04:41.250> it<00:04:41.280> air<00:04:41.580> dry<00:04:41.610> at<00:04:42.030> room<00:04:42.060> temperature

00:04:42.649 --> 00:04:42.659 
just let it air dry at room temperature

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:45.740 
just let it air dry at room temperature
UV<00:04:43.020> I<00:04:43.169> found<00:04:43.740> mine<00:04:43.949> took<00:04:44.190> like<00:04:44.430> two<00:04:45.389> or<00:04:45.539> three

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
UV I found mine took like two or three

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.040 
UV I found mine took like two or three
days<00:04:45.780> to<00:04:46.349> dry<00:04:46.560> to<00:04:46.620> the<00:04:46.830> level<00:04:47.219> where<00:04:47.400> if<00:04:48.050> the

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
days to dry to the level where if the

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.930 
days to dry to the level where if the
same<00:04:49.320> level<00:04:49.530> as<00:04:49.830> if<00:04:50.159> I<00:04:50.280> did<00:04:50.490> it<00:04:50.610> this<00:04:50.729> way

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
same level as if I did it this way

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.060 
same level as if I did it this way
instead<00:04:51.090> so<00:04:51.630> that's<00:04:52.139> why<00:04:52.320> I<00:04:52.349> don't<00:04:52.650> just<00:04:52.860> pop

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
instead so that's why I don't just pop

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.089 
instead so that's why I don't just pop
the<00:04:53.219> corners<00:04:53.520> I<00:04:53.639> just<00:04:53.820> do<00:04:53.909> this<00:04:54.090> instead<00:04:54.509> it's

00:04:55.089 --> 00:04:55.099 
the corners I just do this instead it's

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:59.120 
the corners I just do this instead it's
not<00:04:56.099> like<00:04:56.250> I'm<00:04:56.430> in<00:04:56.550> any<00:04:56.759> rush<00:04:57.030> so<00:04:57.740> yeah<00:04:58.740> all<00:04:59.070> i

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
not like I'm in any rush so yeah all i

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:00.709 
not like I'm in any rush so yeah all i
have<00:04:59.310> to<00:04:59.370> do<00:04:59.520> is<00:04:59.550> wipe<00:04:59.849> this<00:05:00.030> put<00:05:00.479> it<00:05:00.570> back

00:05:00.709 --> 00:05:00.719 
have to do is wipe this put it back

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:03.020 
have to do is wipe this put it back
together<00:05:00.930> and<00:05:01.289> I'm<00:05:01.530> we're<00:05:01.680> good<00:05:01.830> to<00:05:01.919> go<00:05:01.979> so<00:05:02.969> I'm

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
together and I'm we're good to go so I'm

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.670 
together and I'm we're good to go so I'm
going<00:05:03.090> to<00:05:03.240> do<00:05:03.389> that

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:11.010 

and<00:05:06.270> probably<00:05:07.270> cut<00:05:08.910> is<00:05:09.910> there<00:05:10.150> keep<00:05:10.690> his<00:05:10.840> back

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
and probably cut is there keep his back

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.939 
and probably cut is there keep his back
together<00:05:11.490> no<00:05:12.490> particular<00:05:12.970> order<00:05:13.000> though<00:05:13.389> and

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:13.949 
together no particular order though and

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:18.360 
together no particular order though and
nice<00:05:14.949> and<00:05:15.160> smooth<00:05:16.110> could<00:05:17.110> still<00:05:17.350> feel<00:05:17.560> it<00:05:17.770> just

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 
nice and smooth could still feel it just

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.230 
nice and smooth could still feel it just
a<00:05:18.580> tad<00:05:19.180> wet<00:05:20.070> but<00:05:21.070> that'll<00:05:21.610> go<00:05:21.759> away<00:05:21.789> in<00:05:22.120> a<00:05:22.210> few

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 
a tad wet but that'll go away in a few

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.340 
a tad wet but that'll go away in a few
days<00:05:23.910> so<00:05:24.910> it<00:05:25.630> doesn't<00:05:25.870> really<00:05:25.960> matter<00:05:26.139> it's

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:26.350 
days so it doesn't really matter it's

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:27.960 
days so it doesn't really matter it's
still<00:05:26.410> really<00:05:26.710> smooth<00:05:27.070> and<00:05:27.280> I<00:05:27.430> like<00:05:27.610> it<00:05:27.789> so
