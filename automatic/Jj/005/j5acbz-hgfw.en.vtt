the radio when you press the button it

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.350 
the radio when you press the button it
decays<00:01:42.320> every<00:01:42.799> radio<00:01:43.009> that's<00:01:43.490> on<00:01:43.789> the<00:01:43.970> air<00:01:44.090> and

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
decays every radio that's on the air and

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.370 
decays every radio that's on the air and
allows<00:01:45.200> you<00:01:45.530> to<00:01:45.710> then<00:01:46.329> transmit<00:01:47.329> an<00:01:47.539> emergency

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
allows you to then transmit an emergency

00:01:48.380 --> 00:02:00.770 
allows you to then transmit an emergency
