gonna<00:00:25.199> take<00:00:25.830> a<00:00:25.859> couple<00:00:26.130> days<00:00:26.220> off<00:00:26.580> from

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
gonna take a couple days off from

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.150 
gonna take a couple days off from
painting<00:00:27.269> I'm<00:00:27.900> just<00:00:28.109> real<00:00:28.320> tedious<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:28.920> ask

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
painting I'm just real tedious to ask

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.910 
painting I'm just real tedious to ask
but<00:00:29.720> anyhow<00:00:31.399> you<00:00:32.399> can<00:00:32.430> see<00:00:32.730> all<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:33.710> looks<00:00:34.710> and

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
but anyhow you can see all the looks and

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.729 
but anyhow you can see all the looks and
crannies<00:00:35.070> there<00:00:35.670> I<00:00:36.450> think<00:00:37.320> it<00:00:37.410> turned<00:00:37.620> out

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
crannies there I think it turned out

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.780 
crannies there I think it turned out
pretty<00:00:37.920> nice<00:00:39.980> I'm<00:00:40.980> gonna<00:00:41.160> go<00:00:41.309> ahead<00:00:41.430> and

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
pretty nice I'm gonna go ahead and

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:50.110 
pretty nice I'm gonna go ahead and
extend<00:00:42.149> this<00:00:42.390> out

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.270 

and<00:00:51.120> you<00:00:51.420> can<00:00:51.570> see<00:00:51.949> there's<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:53.070> few<00:00:53.370> spots

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
and you can see there's a few spots

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.470 
and you can see there's a few spots
where<00:00:56.280> there's<00:00:56.520> some<00:00:56.670> interaction<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.360> can

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
where there's some interaction you can

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.240 
where there's some interaction you can
see<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.750> silver<00:00:58.020> there<00:00:58.410> but<00:00:58.649> I'm<00:00:58.890> going<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.129> go

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
see the silver there but I'm going to go

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.830 
see the silver there but I'm going to go
ahead<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.550> leave<00:00:59.670> that<00:00:59.730> stuff<00:01:00.300> just<00:01:00.329> like

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
ahead and leave that stuff just like

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:01.760 
ahead and leave that stuff just like
that

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
that

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.660 
that
same<00:01:02.309> thing<00:01:02.520> you<00:01:02.640> can<00:01:02.820> see<00:01:03.000> some<00:01:03.799> there<00:01:04.799> that<00:01:05.640> I

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
same thing you can see some there that I

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.899 
same thing you can see some there that I
think<00:01:06.180> it<00:01:06.390> actually<00:01:06.689> gives<00:01:06.869> it<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.080> pretty<00:01:07.290> nice

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
think it actually gives it a pretty nice

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:11.719 
think it actually gives it a pretty nice
weather<00:01:08.909> kind<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:09.570> realistic<00:01:10.340> look<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.640> if

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
weather kind of realistic look to it if

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:12.920 
weather kind of realistic look to it if
you<00:01:11.820> look<00:01:11.939> at<00:01:12.090> some<00:01:12.270> of<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.420> pictures<00:01:12.630> on<00:01:12.900> the

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
you look at some of the pictures on the

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.200 
you look at some of the pictures on the
internet<00:01:13.020> of<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.590> gear<00:01:13.830> this<00:01:14.729> gear<00:01:14.790> gets

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
internet of the gear this gear gets

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.810 
internet of the gear this gear gets
pretty<00:01:15.630> grimy<00:01:16.310> unless<00:01:17.310> it's<00:01:17.520> on<00:01:17.610> the

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
pretty grimy unless it's on the

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.170 
pretty grimy unless it's on the
thunderbirds<00:01:18.299> so<00:01:18.860> anyways<00:01:19.860> so<00:01:20.790> that<00:01:20.970> looks

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
thunderbirds so anyways so that looks

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.910 
thunderbirds so anyways so that looks
really<00:01:21.270> good

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
really good

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.120 
really good
now<00:01:23.310> we'll<00:01:23.460> go<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.820> main<00:01:24.119> gear<00:01:24.860> not<00:01:25.860> as

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
now we'll go to the main gear not as

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.870 
now we'll go to the main gear not as
happy<00:01:26.460> with<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.030> main<00:01:27.930> gear<00:01:28.549> but<00:01:29.549> I<00:01:29.579> think

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
happy with the main gear but I think

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.969 
happy with the main gear but I think
that's<00:01:30.060> probably<00:01:30.750> mostly<00:01:31.350> my<00:01:31.409> fault<00:01:33.979> overall

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
that's probably mostly my fault overall

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.830 
that's probably mostly my fault overall
it<00:01:35.549> looks<00:01:35.579> pretty<00:01:36.390> good<00:01:37.939> you<00:01:38.939> can<00:01:39.000> see<00:01:39.119> again

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
it looks pretty good you can see again

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.109 
it looks pretty good you can see again
where<00:01:40.049> there's<00:01:40.259> some<00:01:40.470> interaction<00:01:41.189> where<00:01:42.000> the

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
where there's some interaction where the

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.120 
where there's some interaction where the
paint's<00:01:42.450> worn<00:01:42.659> off<00:01:42.869> that<00:01:43.680> doesn't<00:01:44.009> really

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
paint's worn off that doesn't really

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.700 
paint's worn off that doesn't really
bother<00:01:44.369> me<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:44.670> whole<00:01:44.909> lot<00:01:45.119> of<00:01:45.149> kind<00:01:45.720> of<00:01:45.810> Sam<00:01:46.560> -

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
bother me a whole lot of kind of Sam -

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.230 
bother me a whole lot of kind of Sam -
did<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.920> little<00:01:47.100> bit<00:01:47.250> smooth<00:01:47.520> I<00:01:47.700> might<00:01:47.850> hit<00:01:48.060> that

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
did a little bit smooth I might hit that

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.450 
did a little bit smooth I might hit that
with<00:01:48.450> an<00:01:48.570> airbrush<00:01:48.869> later<00:01:49.290> where<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.009> paint

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
with an airbrush later where the paint

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.660 
with an airbrush later where the paint
will<00:01:50.610> be<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:50.729> little<00:01:50.850> bit<00:01:51.030> thinner<00:01:51.290> but<00:01:52.290> I<00:01:53.189> think

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
will be a little bit thinner but I think

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.600 
will be a little bit thinner but I think
I<00:01:53.880> laid<00:01:54.420> it<00:01:54.600> on<00:01:54.720> kind<00:01:55.049> of<00:01:55.170> thick<00:01:55.470> on<00:01:56.369> the

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
I laid it on kind of thick on the

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.730 
I laid it on kind of thick on the
underside<00:01:57.360> here<00:01:57.390> I'm<00:01:58.079> not<00:01:58.259> sure<00:01:58.439> if<00:01:58.560> I'm<00:01:58.649> going

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
underside here I'm not sure if I'm going

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.050 
underside here I'm not sure if I'm going
to<00:01:58.829> be<00:01:58.920> able<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.130> show<00:01:59.310> it<00:01:59.340> or<00:01:59.549> not<00:01:59.670> I've<00:01:59.850> tried

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
to be able to show it or not I've tried

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.740 
to be able to show it or not I've tried
the<00:02:00.210> sand<00:02:00.479> most<00:02:01.350> of<00:02:01.530> it<00:02:01.680> off<00:02:01.829> but<00:02:02.750> looked

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
the sand most of it off but looked

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.950 
the sand most of it off but looked
almost<00:02:03.960> like<00:02:04.140> fingerprints<00:02:05.149> but<00:02:06.149> I<00:02:06.450> barely

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
almost like fingerprints but I barely

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.749 
almost like fingerprints but I barely
barely<00:02:07.590> touches<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.190> only<00:02:08.429> time<00:02:08.580> I<00:02:08.610> really

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
barely touches the only time I really

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.609 
barely touches the only time I really
touch<00:02:09.179> this<00:02:09.390> there<00:02:09.750> you<00:02:09.899> can<00:02:10.050> see<00:02:10.229> kind<00:02:10.410> of<00:02:10.530> a

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
touch this there you can see kind of a

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.270 
touch this there you can see kind of a
little<00:02:10.770> bit<00:02:11.060> there

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
little bit there

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.150 
little bit there
the<00:02:13.760> only<00:02:13.850> time<00:02:14.090> I<00:02:14.120> really<00:02:14.240> touch<00:02:14.720> this<00:02:14.960> was

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
the only time I really touch this was

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.520 
the only time I really touch this was
assembling<00:02:16.160> it<00:02:16.340> so<00:02:16.610> I<00:02:16.850> think<00:02:17.420> I<00:02:17.510> don't<00:02:17.570> didn't

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
assembling it so I think I don't didn't

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.970 
assembling it so I think I don't didn't
let<00:02:18.680> it<00:02:19.810> dry<00:02:20.810> long<00:02:21.110> enough<00:02:21.440> I'm<00:02:21.590> gonna<00:02:21.770> put

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
let it dry long enough I'm gonna put

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.590 
let it dry long enough I'm gonna put
this<00:02:22.100> out<00:02:22.250> in<00:02:22.400> the<00:02:22.490> Sun<00:02:22.730> and<00:02:22.910> just<00:02:23.000> let<00:02:23.210> it<00:02:23.330> bake

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
this out in the Sun and just let it bake

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.290 
this out in the Sun and just let it bake
today<00:02:23.990> so<00:02:24.050> that<00:02:24.380> the<00:02:24.530> paint<00:02:25.030> becomes<00:02:26.030> less

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
today so that the paint becomes less

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.820 
today so that the paint becomes less
rubbery<00:02:26.690> but<00:02:26.870> I<00:02:27.080> think<00:02:27.440> what's<00:02:27.620> actually

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
rubbery but I think what's actually

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.260 
rubbery but I think what's actually
happening<00:02:28.580> I<00:02:28.730> don't<00:02:28.790> think<00:02:29.240> it's<00:02:29.360> necessarily

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
happening I don't think it's necessarily

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.500 
happening I don't think it's necessarily
fingerprints<00:02:32.380> but<00:02:33.380> I<00:02:33.410> think<00:02:34.130> the<00:02:34.910> paint<00:02:35.240> is

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
fingerprints but I think the paint is

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.470 
fingerprints but I think the paint is
actually<00:02:36.280> kind<00:02:37.280> of<00:02:37.340> compressing<00:02:38.000> on<00:02:38.120> itself

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
actually kind of compressing on itself

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.870 
actually kind of compressing on itself
when<00:02:38.780> I<00:02:38.810> like<00:02:39.530> fold<00:02:39.860> the<00:02:40.010> gear<00:02:40.220> in<00:02:40.400> and<00:02:40.580> out<00:02:40.700> and

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
when I like fold the gear in and out and

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.180 
when I like fold the gear in and out and
stuff<00:02:41.180> because<00:02:42.050> it's<00:02:42.230> still<00:02:42.410> kind<00:02:42.650> of<00:02:42.770> elastic

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
stuff because it's still kind of elastic

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.790 
stuff because it's still kind of elastic
so<00:02:43.850> what<00:02:44.150> we're<00:02:44.270> going<00:02:44.390> to<00:02:44.420> try<00:02:44.540> to<00:02:44.660> do<00:02:44.870> is<00:02:45.050> just

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
so what we're going to try to do is just

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.610 
so what we're going to try to do is just
bake<00:02:46.160> it<00:02:46.190> and<00:02:46.489> make<00:02:46.640> it<00:02:47.020> I'd<00:02:48.020> rather<00:02:48.230> have<00:02:48.500> it

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
bake it and make it I'd rather have it

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:55.930 
bake it and make it I'd rather have it
be<00:02:48.650> flaky<00:02:49.310> than<00:02:49.520> elastic<00:02:50.510> I<00:02:54.640> didn't<00:02:55.640> at<00:02:55.820> the

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
be flaky than elastic I didn't at the

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.280 
be flaky than elastic I didn't at the
bar<00:02:56.150> Boyd's<00:02:56.450> I<00:02:58.420> can<00:02:59.420> paint<00:02:59.600> those<00:02:59.810> at<00:03:00.020> another

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
bar Boyd's I can paint those at another

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.460 
bar Boyd's I can paint those at another
time<00:03:00.560> if<00:03:00.770> I<00:03:00.890> need<00:03:00.920> to<00:03:01.310> but<00:03:02.170> right<00:03:03.170> now<00:03:03.350> I<00:03:03.380> think

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
time if I need to but right now I think

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.290 
time if I need to but right now I think
it<00:03:03.800> looks<00:03:04.640> fine<00:03:06.520> you<00:03:07.520> can<00:03:07.700> see<00:03:07.820> where<00:03:07.970> I<00:03:08.000> masked

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
it looks fine you can see where I masked

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.620 
it looks fine you can see where I masked
that<00:03:08.510> off<00:03:08.720> I<00:03:08.930> think<00:03:08.989> that<00:03:09.230> looks<00:03:09.410> pretty<00:03:09.470> cool

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
that off I think that looks pretty cool

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.940 
that off I think that looks pretty cool
looks<00:03:11.630> like<00:03:11.810> the<00:03:11.959> real<00:03:12.110> hydraulics<00:03:12.800> so<00:03:13.810> anyway

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
looks like the real hydraulics so anyway

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.250 
looks like the real hydraulics so anyway
but<00:03:16.150> overall<00:03:17.150> it<00:03:17.330> turned<00:03:17.510> out<00:03:17.630> pretty<00:03:17.750> awesome

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
but overall it turned out pretty awesome

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.780 
but overall it turned out pretty awesome
I<00:03:18.410> just<00:03:18.440> I<00:03:18.950> guess<00:03:19.280> I'm<00:03:19.430> just<00:03:19.610> picky<00:03:19.940> but<00:03:21.790> see

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
I just I guess I'm just picky but see

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.720 
I just I guess I'm just picky but see
here<00:03:23.150> again<00:03:23.900> there's<00:03:24.200> some<00:03:24.410> of<00:03:24.530> those

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
here again there's some of those

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.449 
here again there's some of those
interactions<00:03:26.739> the<00:03:27.739> same<00:03:27.980> thing<00:03:28.220> on<00:03:28.370> the

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
interactions the same thing on the

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:38.340 
interactions the same thing on the
inside<00:03:28.910> there<00:03:30.340> but<00:03:31.340> overall<00:03:32.060> pretty<00:03:35.470> good<00:03:36.470> so

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
inside there but overall pretty good so

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
inside there but overall pretty good so
I'm<00:03:39.350> pretty<00:03:39.680> much<00:03:39.920> done<00:03:40.880> with<00:03:40.940> the<00:03:41.570> gear<00:03:42.370> for

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
I'm pretty much done with the gear for

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.009 
I'm pretty much done with the gear for
right<00:03:43.549> now<00:03:43.579> like<00:03:44.060> I<00:03:44.090> said<00:03:44.360> I'll<00:03:44.480> touch<00:03:44.690> up<00:03:44.900> a

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
right now like I said I'll touch up a

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:48.520 
right now like I said I'll touch up a
little<00:03:45.200> later<00:03:45.440> with<00:03:45.739> a<00:03:46.090> airbrush<00:03:47.260> maybe<00:03:48.260> I<00:03:48.380> can

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
little later with a airbrush maybe I can

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:49.960 
little later with a airbrush maybe I can
put<00:03:48.680> the<00:03:48.769> paint<00:03:48.980> on<00:03:49.160> thin<00:03:49.459> enough<00:03:49.730> that<00:03:49.940> that

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
put the paint on thin enough that that

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:56.770 
put the paint on thin enough that that
won't<00:03:50.709> occur<00:03:51.709> there<00:03:52.250> but<00:03:54.459> anyway<00:03:55.690> we'll<00:03:56.690> get

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
won't occur there but anyway we'll get

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.400 
won't occur there but anyway we'll get
the<00:03:57.340> final<00:03:58.340> details<00:03:58.579> later

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
the final details later

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.819 
the final details later
when<00:04:00.920> I<00:04:00.950> do<00:04:01.070> weather<00:04:01.430> the<00:04:01.670> gear<00:04:02.620> most<00:04:03.620> of<00:04:03.739> this

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:03.829 
when I do weather the gear most of this

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:08.850 
when I do weather the gear most of this
stuff<00:04:04.130> will<00:04:04.310> be<00:04:04.480> not<00:04:05.480> important<00:04:05.959> anyway<00:04:06.230> so

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:14.020 

there<00:04:09.860> you<00:04:09.980> go<00:04:11.019> gear<00:04:12.019> is<00:04:12.049> done<00:04:12.440> and<00:04:13.370> we<00:04:14.000> can

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
there you go gear is done and we can

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.739 
there you go gear is done and we can
move<00:04:14.329> on<00:04:14.570> to<00:04:14.840> something<00:04:15.290> else
