her out because she's lighter to carry
around<00:01:28.790> even<00:01:29.790> in<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:29.970> car<00:01:30.180> seat<00:01:30.450> she<00:01:30.659> feels<00:01:30.930> a

around even in the car seat she feels a
ton<00:01:31.350> lighter<00:01:31.530> than<00:01:31.829> he<00:01:32.009> does<00:01:32.189> but<00:01:32.700> I<00:01:32.729> still

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
ton lighter than he does but I still

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.399

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
piece of advice it's something that I

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.870 
piece of advice it's something that I
think<00:01:39.299> is<00:01:39.420> really<00:01:39.659> important<00:01:40.189> so<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.670> next

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
think is really important so the next

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.270 
think is really important so the next
thing<00:01:42.150> is<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.750> ease<00:01:43.049> your<00:01:43.380> way<00:01:43.560> out<00:01:43.860> of<00:01:44.130> your

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
thing is to ease your way out of your

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.120 
thing is to ease your way out of your
comfort<00:01:44.549> zone<00:01:45.030> or<00:01:45.509> you<00:01:45.570> know<00:01:46.079> into<00:01:46.439> public<00:01:46.890> and

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.010 
comfort zone or you know into public and
this<00:01:47.880> is<00:01:48.000> something<00:01:48.180> that<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:48.600> didn't

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020
