00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
justice to it but that is bright as

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
what we can have I guess those are two

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.140 
what we can have I guess those are two
different<00:01:10.890> questions<00:01:11.189> I<00:01:11.520> think<00:01:11.729> well<00:01:11.850> this<00:01:11.939> is

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
different questions I think well this is

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.899 
different questions I think well this is
the<00:01:12.180> Hollywood<00:01:12.869> smile<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.580> this<00:01:14.580> is<00:01:14.760> the

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
the Hollywood smile and this is the

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.820 
the Hollywood smile and this is the
danger<00:01:15.450> that<00:01:15.479> we<00:01:15.720> have<00:01:15.960> when<00:01:16.200> we're<00:01:16.320> using<00:01:16.590> a

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
danger that we have when we're using a

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.289 
danger that we have when we're using a

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
products there's a lot of limitations we

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.340

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
can achieve this type of white when

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.870 
can achieve this type of white when
we're<00:01:22.470> using<00:01:22.680> these<00:01:22.890> products<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.729> that's

that is that a reasonable that's a
personal<00:01:29.100> decision<00:01:29.189> okay<00:01:29.759> but<00:01:30.090> we<00:01:30.210> need<00:01:30.240> to

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
personal decision okay but we need to

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:31.880 
personal decision okay but we need to
understand<00:01:30.960> that<00:01:31.110> we<00:01:31.200> can't<00:01:31.439> achieve<00:01:31.530> these

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
understand that we can't achieve these

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:32.899 
understand that we can't achieve these
with<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.130> lot<00:01:32.369> of<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.549> over-the-counter

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
whitening products and by using these

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.030 
whitening products and by using these
products<00:01:36.240> beyond<00:01:36.659> their<00:01:36.990> limitations<00:01:37.680> we're

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
products beyond their limitations we're

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.039 
products beyond their limitations we're
actually<00:01:38.189> damaging<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.150> enamel<00:01:39.659> yeah<00:01:39.869> let's

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
actually damaging the enamel yeah let's

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.179 
actually damaging the enamel yeah let's
talk<00:01:40.140> about<00:01:40.290> that<00:01:40.439> let's<00:01:40.590> talk<00:01:40.799> about<00:01:40.950> some<00:01:41.159> of

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
what the limitations are for these

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.210 
what the limitations are for these
over-the-counter<00:01:43.049> products<00:01:43.680> I<00:01:43.770> know<00:01:43.829> one<00:01:44.100> of

over-the-counter products I know one of
your<00:01:44.340> concerns<00:01:44.700> is<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.090> abrasiveness<00:01:45.630> of

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
your concerns is the abrasiveness of

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.450 
your concerns is the abrasiveness of
some<00:01:46.259> of<00:01:46.350> these<00:01:46.439> products<00:01:46.920> yeah<00:01:47.220> what's

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
some of these products yeah what's

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.620 
some of these products yeah what's
happening<00:01:47.820> is<00:01:47.909> when<00:01:48.030> we're<00:01:48.149> using<00:01:48.360> these

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
happening is when we're using these

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.270 
happening is when we're using these
products<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.259> enamel<00:01:49.770> is<00:01:49.829> actually<00:01:50.159> becoming

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
products the enamel is actually becoming

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.609 
products the enamel is actually becoming
more<00:01:50.729> pores<00:01:51.119> it's<00:01:51.450> becoming<00:01:51.810> more<00:01:52.079> brittle

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
more pores it's becoming more brittle

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.200 
more pores it's becoming more brittle
and<00:01:52.770> what<00:01:53.340> we're<00:01:53.460> showing<00:01:53.670> over<00:01:53.970> there<00:01:54.090> in

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
and what we're showing over there in

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.030 
and what we're showing over there in
that<00:01:54.299> picture<00:01:54.570> where<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:54.990> enamel<00:01:55.439> actually

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
that picture where the enamel actually

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.459 
that picture where the enamel actually
starts<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:56.490> break<00:01:56.729> down<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:57.329> even<00:01:58.079> becomes

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
starts to break down and even becomes

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.190 
starts to break down and even becomes
more<00:01:58.770> susceptible<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.700> staining<00:02:00.299> which<00:02:01.020> is

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
more susceptible to staining which is

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.870 
more susceptible to staining which is
the<00:02:01.320> exact<00:02:01.619> opposite<00:02:02.189> that<00:02:02.369> we're<00:02:02.490> looking<00:02:02.640> so

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
the exact opposite that we're looking so

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.639 
the exact opposite that we're looking so
you're<00:02:03.030> opening<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.420> door<00:02:03.659> then<00:02:03.930> in<00:02:04.229> essence

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
you're opening the door then in essence

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.679 
you're opening the door then in essence
to<00:02:05.130> allow<00:02:05.460> me<00:02:05.610> more<00:02:05.759> staining<00:02:06.210> in<00:02:06.299> when<00:02:06.600> you

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
to allow me more staining in when you

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.719 
to allow me more staining in when you
strip<00:02:07.560> back<00:02:07.710> that<00:02:07.890> enamel<00:02:08.310> or<00:02:08.399> hurt<00:02:08.580> the

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
strip back that enamel or hurt the

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.420 
strip back that enamel or hurt the
enamel<00:02:09.119> yeah<00:02:09.840> we're<00:02:10.590> not<00:02:10.739> achieving<00:02:11.220> what<00:02:11.340> the

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
enamel yeah we're not achieving what the

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.910 
enamel yeah we're not achieving what the
ultimate<00:02:11.550> result<00:02:12.090> is<00:02:12.270> is<00:02:12.480> that<00:02:12.660> healthy<00:02:13.349> white

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
ultimate result is is that healthy white

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.280 
ultimate result is is that healthy white
smile<00:02:14.310> what<00:02:15.270> we<00:02:15.390> did<00:02:15.540> do<00:02:15.720> we<00:02:15.810> need<00:02:15.930> to<00:02:16.080> go<00:02:16.230> to

use for my patients to actually stop the
descent<00:02:48.209> of<00:02:48.300> the<00:02:48.510> sensitivity<00:02:48.989> that<00:02:49.260> they're

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
descent of the sensitivity that they're

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.770 
descent of the sensitivity that they're
having<00:02:49.590> will<00:02:50.220> actually<00:02:50.640> use<00:02:50.819> a<00:02:51.180> little<00:02:51.510> gel

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780

and<00:02:53.430> we<00:02:53.489> can<00:02:53.610> actually<00:02:54.080> desensitize<00:02:55.080> the

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
and we can actually desensitize the

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.080 
and we can actually desensitize the
teeth<00:02:55.440> it's<00:02:55.590> a<00:02:55.680> really<00:02:55.890> nice<00:02:56.400> procedure<00:02:56.880> that
