the<00:01:05.790> car<00:01:06.049> so<00:01:07.049> exciting<00:01:07.470> off<00:01:07.530> this<00:01:07.650> is<00:01:07.799> a

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
the car so exciting off this is a

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.980 
the car so exciting off this is a
scuttle<00:01:08.250> as<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.430> said<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:09.299> top<00:01:09.479> panels<00:01:09.840> and

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
scuttle as I said the the top panels and

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.670 
scuttle as I said the the top panels and
mg<00:01:10.320> I<00:01:10.470> think<00:01:10.920> it's<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.159> TA<00:01:11.369> or<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.610> TF<00:01:12.500> the<00:01:13.500> top

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
mg I think it's a TA or a TF the top

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.530 
mg I think it's a TA or a TF the top
panel<00:01:13.860> with<00:01:14.220> with<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.640> flares<00:01:15.030> for<00:01:15.390> the

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
panel with with the flares for the

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.969 
panel with with the flares for the
passenger<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.380> driver<00:01:16.590> side<00:01:17.000> and<00:01:18.000> then<00:01:18.270> the

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
passenger and driver side and then the

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.350 
passenger and driver side and then the
the<00:01:19.979> frame<00:01:20.189> of<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.430> whole<00:01:20.580> car<00:01:20.790> is<00:01:20.970> act<00:01:21.210> I've

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
the frame of the whole car is act I've

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.999 
the frame of the whole car is act I've
got<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.509> couple<00:01:21.960> of<00:01:22.140> oak<00:01:22.259> components<00:01:22.830> but<00:01:22.950> the

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
got a couple of oak components but the

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.910 
got a couple of oak components but the
majority<00:01:23.340> I<00:01:24.000> think<00:01:24.150> it's<00:01:24.390> two<00:01:24.630> or<00:01:25.320> three<00:01:25.680> oak

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
majority I think it's two or three oak

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.499 
majority I think it's two or three oak
components<00:01:26.400> for<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.880> majority<00:01:27.330> of<00:01:27.360> its

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
components for the the majority of its

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.730 
components for the the majority of its
hash<00:01:27.659> with<00:01:28.259> some<00:01:28.290> marine<00:01:29.220> ply<00:01:30.200> the<00:01:31.200> bulkhead

hash with some marine ply the bulkhead

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.980 
hash with some marine ply the bulkhead
is<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.759> all<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.030> aluminium<00:01:33.150> work<00:01:33.630> including

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
is and all the aluminium work including

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.859 
is and all the aluminium work including
the<00:01:34.049> bodies<00:01:34.320> all<00:01:34.500> 1.5<00:01:35.250> mil<00:01:35.579> an<00:01:35.820> iminium<00:01:36.270> apart

from<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.229> door<00:01:37.470> skins<00:01:37.890> which<00:01:38.070> i<00:01:38.220> think<00:01:38.280> are

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
from the door skins which i think are

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.889 
from the door skins which i think are
two<00:01:39.180> millimeter<00:01:39.950> they're<00:01:40.950> slightly<00:01:41.250> thicker

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899 
two millimeter they're slightly thicker

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:46.130 
two millimeter they're slightly thicker
because<00:01:42.950> the<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.340> door<00:01:44.610> skin<00:01:44.880> is<00:01:45.030> actually<00:01:45.210> is

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
because the the door skin is actually is

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.990 
because the the door skin is actually is
actually<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.890> shoot<00:01:47.100> clear<00:01:47.549> thought<00:01:47.820> this

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
actually the shoot clear thought this

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.010 
actually the shoot clear thought this
needs<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.270> be<00:01:48.360> more<00:01:48.540> rigid

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
needs to be more rigid

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.050 
needs to be more rigid
these<00:01:49.740> these<00:01:50.159> I've<00:01:50.340> still<00:01:50.520> got<00:01:50.640> detailed

let<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.689> caches<00:01:58.049> in<00:01:58.229> again<00:01:58.829> there's<00:01:59.040> going<00:01:59.130> to

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
let the caches in again there's going to

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.649 
let the caches in again there's going to
be<00:01:59.280> a<00:01:59.340> trim<00:01:59.610> panel<00:01:59.640> in<00:01:59.939> here<00:02:00.090> so<00:02:00.240> this<00:02:00.329> is<00:02:00.479> this

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
be a trim panel in here so this is this

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:01.399 
be a trim panel in here so this is this
slightly<00:02:00.960> ugly

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
slightly ugly

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.620 
slightly ugly
work<00:02:01.710> is<00:02:01.920> going<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.189> be<00:02:02.250> covered<00:02:02.549> up

battery box okay and this is my scrap
engine<00:02:20.160> this<00:02:20.280> is<00:02:20.430> just<00:02:20.670> it's<00:02:21.330> just<00:02:21.480> here<00:02:21.630> to

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
engine this is just it's just here to

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.260 
engine this is just it's just here to
work<00:02:21.840> out<00:02:22.050> all<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.410> all<00:02:22.830> the<00:02:23.310> dimensions

work out all the all the dimensions
around<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.569> bulkhead<00:02:24.900> all<00:02:24.989> the<00:02:25.080> clearances

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
around the bulkhead all the clearances

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.990 
around the bulkhead all the clearances
the<00:02:27.690> steering<00:02:28.680> box<00:02:28.860> in<00:02:29.069> there<00:02:29.250> with<00:02:29.430> I've<00:02:29.850> got

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
the steering box in there with I've got

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000 
the steering box in there with I've got
a<00:02:30.030> temporary<00:02:30.930> wait<00:02:31.200> until<00:02:31.530> I<00:02:31.590> get<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:31.830> proper

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
a temporary wait until I get the proper

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.680 
a temporary wait until I get the proper
one<00:02:32.250> machined<00:02:32.640> up<00:02:32.819> and<00:02:32.970> anything<00:02:33.180> if<00:02:33.540> it's

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
one machined up and anything if it's

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.729 
one machined up and anything if it's
clear<00:02:34.850> these<00:02:35.850> panels<00:02:36.390> I<00:02:36.600> believe<00:02:37.170> these<00:02:37.680> two

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
clear these panels I believe these two

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.650 
clear these panels I believe these two
front<00:02:38.250> panels<00:02:38.400> here<00:02:38.730> that<00:02:39.090> ulster<00:02:39.420> panels

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
front panels here that ulster panels

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.140 
front panels here that ulster panels
just<00:02:39.840> zoom<00:02:40.080> back<00:02:40.260> a<00:02:40.319> bit<00:02:40.530> so<00:02:40.560> you<00:02:40.680> can<00:02:40.800> actually

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
just zoom back a bit so you can actually

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.120 
just zoom back a bit so you can actually
see<00:02:42.150> the<00:02:43.110> whole<00:02:43.140> sort<00:02:43.590> of<00:02:43.620> front<00:02:43.830> end<00:02:43.920> of<00:02:44.069> the

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
see the whole sort of front end of the

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.940 
see the whole sort of front end of the
car<00:02:44.959> so<00:02:45.959> there<00:02:46.170> I<00:02:46.319> think<00:02:46.590> they're

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
car so there I think they're

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.040 
car so there I think they're
remanufactured<00:02:47.790> Austin<00:02:48.480> seven<00:02:48.750> holes<00:02:48.870> two

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
remanufactured Austin seven holes two

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.900 
remanufactured Austin seven holes two
panels<00:02:49.350> then<00:02:50.010> I've<00:02:50.130> got<00:02:50.250> a<00:02:50.280> normal<00:02:50.519> box<00:02:50.970> saloon

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
panels then I've got a normal box saloon

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.580 
panels then I've got a normal box saloon
I've<00:02:53.910> got<00:02:54.090> a<00:02:54.120> box<00:02:54.390> saloon<00:02:54.690> radiator<00:02:55.140> grille

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.870 

and<00:02:58.590> then<00:02:58.739> you<00:02:58.830> can<00:02:58.950> see<00:02:59.160> I've<00:02:59.280> actually<00:02:59.430> I

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
and then you can see I've actually I

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.400 
and then you can see I've actually I
think<00:03:00.180> you<00:03:00.239> can<00:03:00.390> see<00:03:00.600> down<00:03:00.810> that<00:03:00.959> little<00:03:01.110> gap

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
think you can see down that little gap

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.970 
think you can see down that little gap
have<00:03:01.620> adapted<00:03:02.220> the<00:03:03.230> how<00:03:04.230> adapted<00:03:04.799> those

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
have adapted the how adapted those

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.259 
have adapted the how adapted those
panels<00:03:05.280> to<00:03:05.489> fit<00:03:05.670> this<00:03:05.790> car

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
panels to fit this car

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.900 
panels to fit this car
they've<00:03:06.600> just<00:03:07.220> cut<00:03:08.220> them<00:03:08.370> short<00:03:08.700> and<00:03:08.819> then

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
they've just cut them short and then

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.050 
they've just cut them short and then
bend<00:03:09.120> them<00:03:09.269> back<00:03:09.299> and<00:03:09.660> bolted<00:03:10.019> them<00:03:10.170> in<00:03:11.060> I've

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
bend them back and bolted them in I've

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.830 
bend them back and bolted them in I've
got<00:03:12.120> a<00:03:12.269> tubular<00:03:12.810> exhaust<00:03:14.269> manifold<00:03:15.269> here<00:03:15.510> I'm

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
got a tubular exhaust manifold here I'm

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.319 
got a tubular exhaust manifold here I'm
actually<00:03:16.079> I'm<00:03:16.620> going<00:03:16.769> to<00:03:16.860> read<00:03:17.130> and<00:03:17.970> with<00:03:18.299> a

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
actually I'm going to read and with a

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:19.729 
actually I'm going to read and with a
tree<00:03:18.540> cut<00:03:18.750> that<00:03:18.870> I'll<00:03:18.989> do<00:03:19.110> a<00:03:19.140> video<00:03:19.320> about<00:03:19.560> that

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
tree cut that I'll do a video about that

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.710 
tree cut that I'll do a video about that

going there's another job of what's do I
don't<00:03:46.140> think<00:03:46.170> up<00:03:46.320> all<00:03:46.410> the<00:03:46.500> making<00:03:46.709> video<00:03:46.859> it's

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
don't think up all the making video it's

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.229 
don't think up all the making video it's
just<00:03:47.310> a<00:03:47.340> bit<00:03:47.459> of<00:03:47.549> budging<00:03:47.880> and<00:03:48.000> got<00:03:48.120> to

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
just a bit of budging and got to

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:51.310 
just a bit of budging and got to
actually<00:03:48.359> close<00:03:49.049> that<00:03:49.079> gap<00:03:49.410> up<00:03:49.590> a<00:03:49.709> bit

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320 
actually close that gap up a bit

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.110 
actually close that gap up a bit
there's<00:03:52.320> the<00:03:52.530> interior<00:03:53.070> so<00:03:53.700> there's<00:03:53.910> the

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
there's the interior so there's the

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.539 
there's the interior so there's the
inside<00:03:55.049> of<00:03:55.200> the<00:03:55.290> bulkhead<00:03:55.709> still<00:03:56.310> a<00:03:56.340> lot<00:03:56.459> of

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
inside of the bulkhead still a lot of

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:58.400 
inside of the bulkhead still a lot of
work<00:03:56.670> to<00:03:56.790> do<00:03:56.880> that<00:03:57.030> of<00:03:57.359> the<00:03:57.840> transmission

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
work to do that of the transmission

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:59.930 
work to do that of the transmission
cover<00:03:58.590> a<00:03:58.680> lot<00:03:58.829> to<00:03:58.920> make<00:03:59.100> I<00:03:59.310> don't<00:03:59.670> think<00:03:59.850> it's

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
cover a lot to make I don't think it's

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.250 
cover a lot to make I don't think it's
particularly<00:04:00.329> interesting<00:04:00.510> about<00:04:01.019> how

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
particularly interesting about how

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.530 
particularly interesting about how
that's<00:04:01.500> done<00:04:01.680> so<00:04:02.010> I'm<00:04:02.970> not<00:04:03.209> going<00:04:03.359> to<00:04:03.450> bother

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
that's done so I'm not going to bother

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:04.849 
that's done so I'm not going to bother
go<00:04:03.720> into<00:04:03.870> much<00:04:04.019> more<00:04:04.049> detail<00:04:04.230> than<00:04:04.620> that<00:04:04.650> so<00:04:04.829> I

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
go into much more detail than that so I

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:07.270 
go into much more detail than that so I
just<00:04:04.980> got<00:04:05.100> to<00:04:05.190> make<00:04:05.250> another<00:04:05.489> million<00:04:05.700> cover

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
just got to make another million cover

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.180 
just got to make another million cover

box<00:04:29.180> in<00:04:29.419> there<00:04:29.570> I<00:04:29.600> was<00:04:29.840> until<00:04:30.050> Club<00:04:30.440> box

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
box in there I was until Club box

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.110 
box in there I was until Club box
because<00:04:31.009> I<00:04:31.039> didn't<00:04:31.250> want<00:04:31.400> the<00:04:31.490> extra

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
because I didn't want the extra

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.969 
because I didn't want the extra
complication<00:04:32.690> of<00:04:32.750> hinges<00:04:33.110> and<00:04:33.259> box<00:04:33.770> and

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:33.979 
complication of hinges and box and

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:35.680 
complication of hinges and box and
everything<00:04:34.280> but<00:04:35.000> I<00:04:35.090> think<00:04:35.120> it's<00:04:35.479> going<00:04:35.630> to

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
everything but I think it's going to

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.810 
everything but I think it's going to
look<00:04:35.780> a<00:04:35.900> bit<00:04:36.050> odd<00:04:36.229> was<00:04:36.710> just<00:04:36.979> a<00:04:37.160> big<00:04:37.340> sheet<00:04:37.789> of

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
look a bit odd was just a big sheet of

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.200 
look a bit odd was just a big sheet of
expensive<00:04:38.479> aluminium<00:04:38.930> this<00:04:39.770> is<00:04:39.919> actually<00:04:40.310> the

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
expensive aluminium this is actually the

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.719 
expensive aluminium this is actually the
the<00:04:42.199> aluminium<00:04:42.410> of<00:04:42.770> useless<00:04:43.160> -<00:04:43.340> borders<00:04:43.639> are

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:43.729 
the aluminium of useless - borders are

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:46.240 
the aluminium of useless - borders are
for<00:04:43.940> Lance<00:04:44.690> your<00:04:44.930> Augusta<00:04:45.380> so<00:04:45.530> it's<00:04:45.650> like<00:04:45.740> a<00:04:45.770> 70

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
for Lance your Augusta so it's like a 70

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.760 
for Lance your Augusta so it's like a 70
or<00:04:46.310> 80<00:04:46.550> year<00:04:46.820> old<00:04:46.970> bit<00:04:47.090> of<00:04:47.210> aluminium<00:04:47.330> I<00:04:47.840> don't

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
or 80 year old bit of aluminium I don't

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:49.870 
or 80 year old bit of aluminium I don't
know<00:04:48.949> if<00:04:49.070> that's<00:04:49.220> actually<00:04:49.370> gonna<00:04:49.669> actually

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
know if that's actually gonna actually

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.879 
know if that's actually gonna actually
look<00:04:50.180> like<00:04:50.240> an<00:04:50.539> old<00:04:50.660> bit<00:04:50.750> of<00:04:50.840> aluminium<00:04:51.500> I'm

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:51.889 
look like an old bit of aluminium I'm

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:53.080 
look like an old bit of aluminium I'm
going<00:04:52.009> to<00:04:52.070> clean<00:04:52.220> it<00:04:52.310> up<00:04:52.370> with<00:04:52.430> wet<00:04:52.699> and<00:04:52.910> dry

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
going to clean it up with wet and dry

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.029 
going to clean it up with wet and dry
and<00:04:53.150> give<00:04:53.389> it<00:04:53.479> a<00:04:53.539> solid<00:04:53.660> dull<00:04:53.990> polish<00:04:54.500> and

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:55.039 
and give it a solid dull polish and

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:56.800 
and give it a solid dull polish and
hopefully<00:04:55.610> the<00:04:55.729> edge<00:04:55.910> of<00:04:56.090> it<00:04:56.180> will<00:04:56.330> come

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
hopefully the edge of it will come

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.360 
hopefully the edge of it will come
through<00:04:57.020> there'll<00:04:57.229> be<00:04:57.259> some<00:04:57.530> sort<00:04:57.680> marks<00:04:58.190> and

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
through there'll be some sort marks and

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.100 
through there'll be some sort marks and
stuff<00:04:58.490> that<00:04:58.639> will<00:04:58.910> show<00:04:59.090> that<00:04:59.750> make<00:04:59.900> it<00:05:00.020> look

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110 
stuff that will show that make it look

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:01.719 
stuff that will show that make it look
like<00:05:00.169> an<00:05:00.289> old<00:05:00.380> bit<00:05:00.500> of<00:05:00.590> aluminium<00:05:00.680> my<00:05:01.400> aim<00:05:01.520> is

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:01.729 
like an old bit of aluminium my aim is

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:03.670 
like an old bit of aluminium my aim is
that<00:05:01.759> the<00:05:02.000> car<00:05:02.210> looks<00:05:02.449> genuinely<00:05:03.169> old<00:05:03.410> and

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
that the car looks genuinely old and

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.360 
that the car looks genuinely old and
doesn't<00:05:03.800> like<00:05:04.070> a<00:05:04.099> brand<00:05:04.460> new<00:05:04.639> special

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
doesn't like a brand new special

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.469 
doesn't like a brand new special
there's<00:05:07.370> my<00:05:07.610> spare<00:05:07.910> wheels<00:05:08.090> yet<00:05:08.270> to<00:05:08.389> be

there's my spare wheels yet to be

blasted and aged block I've got the tire
for<00:05:10.580> it<00:05:10.669> back<00:05:10.789> and<00:05:10.880> put<00:05:10.970> it<00:05:11.060> on<00:05:11.150> the<00:05:11.780> fill<00:05:11.960> is<00:05:12.050> a

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
for it back and put it on the fill is a

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.879 
for it back and put it on the fill is a
bit<00:05:12.229> rough<00:05:12.380> because<00:05:12.560> I<00:05:12.590> haven't<00:05:12.740> actually

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:12.889 
bit rough because I haven't actually

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:15.999 
bit rough because I haven't actually
been<00:05:13.490> building<00:05:13.940> up<00:05:14.090> to<00:05:14.539> get<00:05:15.320> curves<00:05:15.620> correct<00:05:15.919> I

00:05:15.999 --> 00:05:16.009 
been building up to get curves correct I

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:18.790 
been building up to get curves correct I
mean<00:05:16.160> my<00:05:16.280> panel<00:05:16.639> work<00:05:16.789> is<00:05:17.000> not<00:05:17.229> the<00:05:18.229> best<00:05:18.470> ever

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
mean my panel work is not the best ever

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.409 
I'm hoping to get everything done in two
months<00:05:28.490> but<00:05:28.699> it's<00:05:28.880> an<00:05:28.940> overly<00:05:29.270> ambitious

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:29.419 
months but it's an overly ambitious

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:32.320 
months but it's an overly ambitious
target<00:05:30.260> which<00:05:30.409> I'm<00:05:30.620> probably<00:05:31.030> not<00:05:32.030> going<00:05:32.240> to

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:32.330 
target which I'm probably not going to

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:33.670 
target which I'm probably not going to
meet<00:05:32.449> in<00:05:32.690> any<00:05:32.810> shape<00:05:33.020> or<00:05:33.139> form<00:05:33.199> but<00:05:33.440> I'm<00:05:33.530> going

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.680
