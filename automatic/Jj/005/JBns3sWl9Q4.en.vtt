00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
anything that looked like a cupcake and

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.540 
anything that looked like a cupcake and
so<00:01:38.320> I<00:01:38.380> asked<00:01:38.650> the<00:01:38.740> girls<00:01:38.860> if<00:01:39.070> they<00:01:39.100> ever<00:01:39.310> had

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:39.550 
so I asked the girls if they ever had

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.030 
so I asked the girls if they ever had
one<00:01:39.790> and<00:01:40.090> they<00:01:41.050> didn't<00:01:41.650> really<00:01:41.800> know<00:01:41.890> what

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
one and they didn't really know what

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.860 
one and they didn't really know what
they<00:01:42.190> were<00:01:42.250> so<00:01:42.700> I<00:01:42.760> decided<00:01:43.090> I<00:01:43.210> would<00:01:43.270> make<00:01:43.630> some

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:43.870 
they were so I decided I would make some

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.570 
they were so I decided I would make some
for<00:01:44.110> them<00:01:44.290> it's<00:01:44.650> funny<00:01:44.920> because<00:01:45.100> they<00:01:45.430> don't

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
for them it's funny because they don't

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.490 
for them it's funny because they don't
really<00:01:45.730> know<00:01:45.850> what<00:01:46.120> frosting<00:01:46.660> is<00:01:46.840> and<00:01:47.350> they

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
really know what frosting is and they

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.990 
really know what frosting is and they
were<00:01:47.590> a<00:01:47.620> little<00:01:47.710> skeptical<00:01:48.310> at<00:01:48.400> first<00:01:48.670> trying

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
were a little skeptical at first trying

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.030 
were a little skeptical at first trying
them<00:01:49.300> I<00:01:49.540> think<00:01:49.750> once<00:01:49.930> they<00:01:50.140> had<00:01:50.380> them<00:01:50.620> for<00:01:50.979> the

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
them I think once they had them for the

00:01:51.040 --> 00:02:01.040 
them I think once they had them for the
first<00:01:51.190> time<00:01:51.340> they<00:01:51.700> absolutely<00:01:52.090> loved<00:01:52.600> them

someone<00:04:36.050> calls<00:04:36.229> me<00:04:36.410> Sarah<00:04:36.590> in<00:04:36.740> the<00:04:36.770> sack<00:04:36.979> with

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
someone calls me Sarah in the sack with
