cooking with convection heat you might

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.200 
cooking with convection heat you might
want<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.310> turn<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.640> temperature<00:00:38.790> down<00:00:39.030> a

heat down a little bit rule of thumb is

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.110 
heat down a little bit rule of thumb is
about<00:00:46.440> 50<00:00:46.920> degrees<00:00:47.010> or<00:00:47.579> you<00:00:47.640> can<00:00:47.760> adjust<00:00:47.850> your

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
about 50 degrees or you can adjust your

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.689 
about 50 degrees or you can adjust your
heat<00:00:48.300> times<00:00:48.449> as<00:00:48.660> well<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:49.679> broiler<00:00:49.949> on<00:00:50.399> this
