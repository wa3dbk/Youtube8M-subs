00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 hello together again in the film factory 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.270
 I have a movie by Steven Spielberg 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.010
 brought in lincoln and left is yes 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.260
 one of the big favorites in the oscar 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.509
 but also at the barren moment 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.880
 bafta what is buster are the British 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.820
 film awards and steven spielberg brings 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.710
 just the biopic about abraham lincoln 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.480
 out and he just does not take it 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.820
 complete life but a certain 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.650
 period of time because that's what it's about 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.660
 certain law namely that slaves 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.220
 law to pass just that the 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.679
 slaves no longer have to be slaves 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.960
 but ordinary citizens gave it 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.790
 really stressful at that time in America 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.469
 danny day-lewis we know that very much 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.780
 wants to be blood or gangs of new 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.610
 york is known for being his 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.930
 role not only plays but one with 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.360
 the figure becomes and you realize that too 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.770
 at abraham lincoln you can do that 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.390
 now first in a scene watch 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.910
 that I really do not have any 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.539
 tell nonsense and the first action of 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:01:00.030
 war is the same thing as the same thing 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:01.980
 they are the same as each other 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.500
 is a rule mathematical thinking it 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:11.299
 true because it works has 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:15.150
 it will always be in his book 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:17.040
 says the song that is self-evident there 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.930
 So it is already in this 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.270
 2000 year old book about the 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.700
 it's a self 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.130
 evident fact that all things are the 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.909
 the same are the same to each other 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.500
 the same you are already seeing the 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.329
 picture the whole is already as 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.670
 two and a half hour history lesson 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.799
 Created for this works great 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.299
 of course you need the actor to do that 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.890
 fill with life and danny the whole 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.200
 lewis I can only say hat again 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.299
 From when I have a really great performance 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.979
 and for me definitely one of the 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.630
 serve absolute oscar candidates 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.340
 actually would have to win 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.470
 he would not have that only a few years ago 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.790
 sally field is already done 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.219
 that you have not seen for a long time 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.840
 as a wife of abraham lincoln and joseph 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.210
 gordon levitt is currently somehow 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.880
 never to watch the third movie plays the 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.680
 Son but the best role for me for 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.259
 tommy lee jones from the later added 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.819
 that stevens for 30 years so 30 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.979
 for years in time or tension 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.140
 Film has already been fighting for it 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.270
 that the slaves 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.760
 no longer need to be slaves and he 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.980
 has the magical scene in my mind 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.520
 whole movies towards the end where you really are 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.050
 it must be an emotion that solves 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.750
 that's really emotions 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.660
 excellently done and good for everyone 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.370
 Actors are quite outstanding 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.720
 Actors are not everything 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.450
 in such a movie the script must 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.160
 The camera is the right equipment and 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.690
 afterwards steven spielberg is similar 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.110
 only if we have since yesterday and he knows 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.980
 what he does the camera is relative 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.450
 conservative so it is not now 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.280
 Something crazy happens 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.540
 or im cut that one now 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.850
 is surprised on the artistic 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.760
 but it is really real 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.980
 pulled through a red thread equal 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.080
 Remember the goal is for the movie 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.880
 very reassuring the only thing you can 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.860
 say it is just to calm down 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.390
 if the whole movie is relatively quiet 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.340
 This is two and a half hours is very 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.110
 very dialogue-intensive and then it just has to 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.120
 always take care that at some places 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.190
 I get too much information because I 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.690
 I did not live at the time 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.610
 I'm not a history student and must 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.320
 just be very focused because if 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.910
 i can also record all the facts and 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.820
 then put it in the right order 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:22.579
 but that's going to happen somehow 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:25.280
 These are moments when I say good 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:26.840
 the cut and then cut you know 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.310
 yes I am a friend of film 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.840
 just make it shorter if they are 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.269
 200 hours go and that's why I am 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.310
 also in this film of conviction 20 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:36.920
 minutes shorter and it would be the movie 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.840
 Find more people who should be really good 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.970
 of course, the whole look at first 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.280
 times friends of biopics so if one 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.840
 biography or parts of a true one 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.220
 story comes to the screen 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.500
 that's just a history lesson I have 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.780
 already said at the beginning and would be there 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.799
 Have fun watching it because 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.489
 It is really very good here 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:54.860
 become 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:56.060
 also friends of acting cinema are allowed 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.579
 the whole thing does not escape 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.680
 like to leave day-lewis pavers 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:02.660
 really to the very top on who is that 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.489
 whole should not look are just 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.829
 People who do not like biopics 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:09.049
 a big surprise and that too 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:11.209
 the slow narrative is also relative 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:13.489
 conservatively staged camera is indeed 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:16.609
 it has become great but it is just 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:18.769
 a few walls 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.959
 put and it tempo is there 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.100
 not who in the problem has with easy 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.960
 this movie left 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.210
 I let myself lie down personally 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.590
 out of ten points for this movie 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.390
 I think for a long time maybe nine 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.160
 but I have just with longer 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:32.990
 but a few problems and something 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.850
 sluggish staging nevertheless is 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.170
 this movie is very important and me 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:37.760
 It can also be understood that the in 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:39.710
 America is not just over 100 million 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.390
 has recorded dollar but at the 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.280
 oscars is also among the favorites because 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.750
 is simply historically one of the 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.920
 most important moments of the 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.870
 American history 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.970
 that has become very good, too 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:52.250
 just with small smears but eight 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.330
 Ten points is a very good one 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.980
 result as I think 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.600
 can you liked it in the review set 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:58.550
 I still like to thumb up 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.680
 do you like such films generally like that 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.120
 which biopics do you know what do you have 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.160
 already seen what would you like 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.660
 have filmed but writes in the 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.950
 I am always very happy about comments 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.840
 otherwise I'll have you here 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.910
 one possibility you other others 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.520
 to look at the review from the last days 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:17.290
 that was definitely the case for today 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.290
 the film critic from the film factory
