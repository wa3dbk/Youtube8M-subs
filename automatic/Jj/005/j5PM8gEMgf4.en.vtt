00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
the first two practices start out a

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.310 
the first two practices start out a
little<00:01:34.880> started<00:01:35.300> out<00:01:35.390> a<00:01:35.420> little<00:01:35.510> bit<00:01:35.750> slow<00:01:36.080> but

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.360 
the third practice I figured up a little
bit<00:01:38.060> and<00:01:38.270> you<00:01:38.840> not<00:01:38.990> think<00:01:39.230> from<00:01:39.920> my<00:01:40.040> fourth

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:40.370 
bit and you not think from my fourth
