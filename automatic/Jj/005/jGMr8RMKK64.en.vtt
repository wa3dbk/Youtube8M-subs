00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:18.330
 hello everybody I know I have here one 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:22.320
 boxing will also serve as saw haste 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.240
 for this pen here O will give to 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.059
 focus on shooting with the galaxy 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.070
 note of 2 and also easier to make 

00:00:27.059 --> 00:00:32.009
 these footage is more item 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.329
 the galaxy note 10.1 but the route it 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:39.629
 works on galaxy note at 7,000 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:43.670
 It works on galaxy note in 1900 in the then 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:46.530
 and nine thousand and 95 in 900 and anything 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.659
 does not work on the galaxy note two do not know 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.800
 if it works in lot 8 so we can work 

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:58.039
 at night 8 but not working on t2 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:58.039
 her code that you can see 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:09.450
 I think it gives the s 200 hebe is the tst of eu 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:14.610
 I already opened this pen I received it for 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:16.409
 do you see it right then an agreement was that 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.950
 I did serve to help the store do 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.570
 the sale of this product stranded not 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.369
 be part of the agreement and see which store 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.200
 nor what the value then no use 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:34.100
 wondering where none 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:36.509
 sought and here are the usual papers 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.310
 explaining how I use it but who already 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.009
 used this thinking in more or less how it is 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:48.490
 that works so you do not have to stay 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:51.560
 seeing these papers are here are pen 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:54.950
 show what else there is 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.680
 it comes with these pointers let it open 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:04.610
 that the tips have two types of 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:08.840
 different tip you have the chance you have 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:10.790
 the white tips black pieces here 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:18.880
 in fact it is made of white only 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:18.880
 envelopes enveloped by a black plastic 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.740
 some people ask me who knows 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.750
 this piece here 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:32.270
 I'll show you in this pen that 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:33.860
 fulfill what it serves this point 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.280
 here's the pen 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:41.930
 she spends she's not like csp's 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:45.170
 previous is from the north on2 spent 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:50.930
 So I need your tip here. 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:56.800
 to hold the tip of the pen 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.800
 stay tightly there and take 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:06.470
 So people arrest there and pull to power. 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:08.390
 make the tip change using some 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.090
 Witness time of two does not work 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:15.560
 now i'm with the galaxy note 3 is 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:21.230
 running right and Sergio Sasaki and 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:24.459
 the normal functions that are seen in na sp 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.459
 I can do it here 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:31.130
 including the capacitive buttons hotels 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:37.910
 the camera you could not see 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:42.040
 a detector combating or even 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.040
 function of the command 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:55.069
 while using the other pen 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:57.630
 cool thing like here for the sketchbook 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:04:00.720
 who likes to draw nice pen 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:04.620
 here I can use it to draw 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.970
 write anything like that 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.459
 even if I do not want to erase I can 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:13.200
 use this tip here that works 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:18.239
 as a kind of rubber only there she 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:21.320
 give in to the pressure and watch that I pass it 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.320
 here grip 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:31.380
 she pays then she has she has the function 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:34.110
 rubber function and reiser on that part 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:40.580
 from behind here on the front 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:40.580
 works like normal s &amp; p 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:50.520
 I do not know why samsung does not 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:52.770
 He made it compatible with other two but 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.229
 not made is compatible with all other 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:05:01.110
 in others I do not know how the eight but with a 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:05:09.210
 or two is not right and insensitive works 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:12.090
 the very interesting accessory 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:15.139
