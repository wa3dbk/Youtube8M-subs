00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
redstone clock using command blocks and

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:31.790 
redstone clock using command blocks and
if<00:00:30.719> you<00:00:30.750> haven't<00:00:30.929> seen<00:00:31.079> that<00:00:31.109> video<00:00:31.320> I'll<00:00:31.529> post

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
a link in the description and an

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.840 
a link in the description and an
annotation<00:00:35.000> but<00:00:36.379> basically<00:00:37.640> with<00:00:38.640> this

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
annotation but basically with this

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.439 
annotation but basically with this
system<00:00:39.089> now<00:00:39.449> we<00:00:39.510> can<00:00:39.870> use<00:00:39.899> it<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:41.300> make<00:00:42.300> it

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:42.449 
system now we can use it to make it

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:43.910 
system now we can use it to make it
appear<00:00:42.479> as<00:00:42.870> if<00:00:43.050> we<00:00:43.199> have<00:00:43.290> turned<00:00:43.530> into<00:00:43.739> an

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
appear as if we have turned into an

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.160 
appear as if we have turned into an
animal<00:00:44.250> in<00:00:44.339> mine<00:00:44.519> or<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.820> mob<00:00:45.180> in<00:00:45.420> Minecraft<00:00:45.899> and

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
animal in mine or a mob in Minecraft and

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.680 
animal in mine or a mob in Minecraft and
the<00:00:47.159> way<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.339> would<00:00:47.550> do<00:00:47.699> that<00:00:47.850> is<00:00:48.089> let's

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
the way you would do that is let's

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.639 
the way you would do that is let's
create<00:00:48.899> our<00:00:49.050> mob<00:00:49.290> first<00:00:49.879> so<00:00:50.879> we<00:00:51.000> have<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.149> cow

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:51.649 
create our mob first so we have a cow

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:55.729 
create our mob first so we have a cow
let's<00:00:52.649> name<00:00:52.859> him<00:00:53.039> mr.<00:00:53.609> moo<00:00:53.760> moo<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.739> then

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
let's name him mr. moo moo and then

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.029 
let's name him mr. moo moo and then
let's<00:00:56.010> create<00:00:56.190> another<00:00:56.339> command<00:00:56.910> block<00:00:57.149> that

00:00:58.029 --> 00:00:58.039 
let's create another command block that

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:02.329 
let's create another command block that
extends<00:00:59.039> out<00:00:59.219> from<00:00:59.670> our<00:00:59.910> clock<00:01:00.179> and<00:01:01.129> in<00:01:02.129> there

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:02.339 
extends out from our clock and in there

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:09.830 
extends out from our clock and in there
we<00:01:02.429> want<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:02.640> put<00:01:02.879> TP<00:01:03.809> at<00:01:05.270> entity<00:01:06.679> type<00:01:08.840> equals

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
we want to put TP at entity type equals

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.919 
we want to put TP at entity type equals
cow<00:01:10.649> with<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:10.979> capital<00:01:11.280> C<00:01:11.759> and<00:01:12.649> then<00:01:13.649> name

00:01:14.919 --> 00:01:14.929 
cow with a capital C and then name

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:17.540 
cow with a capital C and then name
equals<00:01:15.929> and<00:01:16.319> then<00:01:16.710> whatever<00:01:16.890> you<00:01:17.190> would<00:01:17.280> name

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.550 
equals and then whatever you would name

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.800 
equals and then whatever you would name
the<00:01:18.179> entity<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:20.000> close<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.179> off<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.690> then

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
the entity and close that off and then

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.219 
the entity and close that off and then
we<00:01:21.840> want<00:01:22.050> to<00:01:22.080> teleport<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.770> mob<00:01:23.040> at<00:01:24.229> ourself

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
we want to teleport that mob at ourself

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.530 
we want to teleport that mob at ourself
so<00:01:25.890> we'll<00:01:26.040> do<00:01:27.140> name<00:01:28.140> equals<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:29.159> then<00:01:29.640> your

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
so we'll do name equals and then your

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.160 
so we'll do name equals and then your
username<00:01:32.240> so<00:01:33.240> once<00:01:33.390> you've<00:01:33.509> done<00:01:33.659> that<00:01:33.719> when

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
username so once you've done that when

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.240 
username so once you've done that when
you<00:01:34.259> turn<00:01:34.380> this<00:01:34.590> system<00:01:34.829> on<00:01:35.159> now<00:01:36.920> mr.<00:01:37.920> moo<00:01:38.130> moo

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
you turn this system on now mr. moo moo

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.870 
you turn this system on now mr. moo moo
now<00:01:38.460> follows<00:01:39.210> your<00:01:39.329> movements<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.880> goes

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
now follows your movements and goes

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.830 
now follows your movements and goes
where<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.149> go<00:01:42.240> so<00:01:43.049> if<00:01:43.140> you<00:01:43.229> go<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.409> hit<00:01:43.560> f5<00:01:44.840> you

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
where you go so if you go to hit f5 you

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.630 
where you go so if you go to hit f5 you
can<00:01:45.960> see<00:01:46.170> now<00:01:46.380> if<00:01:46.500> I<00:01:46.560> drink<00:01:46.799> a<00:01:46.979> potion<00:01:47.430> of

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
can see now if I drink a potion of

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.580 
can see now if I drink a potion of
invisibility<00:01:50.539> and<00:01:51.539> let's<00:01:51.869> put<00:01:52.170> away<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.380> item

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
invisibility and let's put away the item

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.810 
invisibility and let's put away the item
so<00:01:52.740> now<00:01:52.890> that<00:01:52.950> I'm<00:01:53.219> not<00:01:53.369> carrying<00:01:53.610> anything

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820
