that's<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.989> most<00:00:58.140> important<00:00:58.620> thing<00:00:58.770> is<00:00:58.890> to

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
that's the most important thing is to

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.920 
that's the most important thing is to
try<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.340> free<00:00:59.640> him<00:00:59.879> without<00:01:00.180> breaking<00:01:00.390> any<00:01:00.809> of

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
try and free him without breaking any of

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.750 
try and free him without breaking any of
his<00:01:01.079> teeth<00:01:01.320> because<00:01:01.649> that's<00:01:02.340> going<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:02.579> put

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
his teeth because that's going to put

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.960 
his teeth because that's going to put
him<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:03.000> real<00:01:03.270> disadvantage<00:01:04.049> in<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.320> wild<00:01:04.650> with

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
him a real disadvantage in the wild with

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.550 
him a real disadvantage in the wild with
having<00:01:05.970> broken<00:01:06.360> teeth<00:01:06.600> because<00:01:07.049> their<00:01:07.260> teeth

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
having broken teeth because their teeth

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.070 
having broken teeth because their teeth
keep<00:01:07.860> growing<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.570> they<00:01:09.570> need<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.869> rub

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
keep growing and they need to rub

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.570 
keep growing and they need to rub
against<00:01:10.470> each<00:01:10.590> other<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:11.070> keep<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.510> right

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
against each other to keep the right

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.749 
against each other to keep the right
length<00:01:15.650> those<00:01:16.650> teeth<00:01:16.950> are<00:01:17.130> free<00:01:17.430> it's<00:01:17.640> the

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
length those teeth are free it's the

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.130 
length those teeth are free it's the
bottom<00:01:18.030> teeth<00:01:18.270> that<00:01:18.450> are<00:01:18.570> stuck

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
bottom teeth that are stuck

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.710 
bottom teeth that are stuck
I<00:01:20.580> can't<00:01:21.580> see<00:01:21.790> any<00:01:21.940> other<00:01:22.060> way<00:01:22.120> of<00:01:22.240> doing<00:01:22.480> it

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 
I can't see any other way of doing it

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.960 
I can't see any other way of doing it
we're<00:01:22.870> gonna<00:01:22.960> have<00:01:23.170> to<00:01:23.350> cut<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:24.640> cut<00:01:24.820> the

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
we're gonna have to cut and cut the

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.190 
we're gonna have to cut and cut the
whiskers<00:01:25.360> off<00:01:25.510> little<00:01:25.810> man

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
whiskers off little man

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.550 
whiskers off little man
I<00:01:27.750> wonder<00:01:28.750> if<00:01:28.810> that<00:01:28.960> would<00:01:29.050> make<00:01:29.260> a<00:01:29.290> bit<00:01:29.530> of

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
I wonder if that would make a bit of

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.640 
I wonder if that would make a bit of
difference<00:01:29.650> if<00:01:30.250> we<00:01:30.370> get<00:01:30.550> the<00:01:30.640> peanuts<00:01:31.000> out<00:01:34.650> we

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.650 
difference if we get the peanuts out we

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.469 
difference if we get the peanuts out we
can<00:01:35.830> actually<00:01:35.980> see<00:01:36.400> a<00:01:36.430> bit<00:01:36.700> more<00:01:36.729> what's<00:01:37.120> going

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
can actually see a bit more what's going

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:43.940 
can actually see a bit more what's going
on

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.580 

I<00:01:43.980> tell<00:01:44.670> you<00:01:44.760> what<00:01:44.940> it<00:01:45.630> really<00:01:45.960> is<00:01:46.080> true<00:01:46.380> that

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
I tell you what it really is true that

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.880 
I tell you what it really is true that
every<00:01:46.770> single<00:01:47.280> day<00:01:47.610> is<00:01:47.790> different<00:01:48.000> here<00:01:48.390> I

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
every single day is different here I

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.620 
every single day is different here I
have<00:01:49.890> never<00:01:50.250> had<00:01:50.490> one<00:01:50.550> stuck<00:01:51.060> as<00:01:51.210> badly<00:01:51.450> as

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
brought him in and they would never have

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.500 
brought him in and they would never have
meant<00:01:58.020> this<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.230> happen<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:58.830> him<00:01:58.980> at<00:01:59.100> all

00:01:59.500 --> 00:01:59.510 
meant this to happen to him at all

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.060 
meant this to happen to him at all
they're<00:02:00.510> just<00:02:00.690> trying<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.020> do<00:02:01.260> the<00:02:01.530> nice<00:02:01.680> thing

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
they're just trying to do the nice thing

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.719

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:08.040 
but actually to be honest peanuts are

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.980 
but actually to be honest peanuts are
quite<00:02:08.220> bad<00:02:08.399> for<00:02:08.759> any<00:02:08.970> animals<00:02:09.509> at<00:02:09.630> this<00:02:09.780> time
