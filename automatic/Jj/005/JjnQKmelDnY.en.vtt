00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
alright this one takes a while for it to

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:52.410 
alright this one takes a while for it to
load<00:02:45.610> so<00:02:46.610> that's<00:02:46.760> a<00:02:46.880> turn

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.330 

but<00:02:53.420> and<00:02:53.900> I<00:02:54.140> also<00:02:54.350> heard<00:02:54.650> that<00:02:54.710> you<00:02:54.890> can<00:02:55.130> take

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
but and I also heard that you can take

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.000 
but and I also heard that you can take
it<00:02:55.520> in<00:02:55.810> take<00:02:56.810> it<00:02:56.840> in<00:02:57.020> for<00:02:57.200> warranty<00:02:57.740> but<00:02:57.980> I

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
it in take it in for warranty but I

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
it in take it in for warranty but I
think<00:02:58.280> that<00:02:58.430> once<00:02:58.580> you<00:02:58.700> expose<00:03:00.370> so<00:03:01.370> I<00:03:01.640> think

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
think that once you expose so I think

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:08.050 
think that once you expose so I think
that's<00:03:02.300> gonna<00:03:02.540> work<00:03:06.010> because<00:03:07.010> this<00:03:07.190> and<00:03:07.760> I

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
that's gonna work because this and I

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.810 
that's gonna work because this and I
also<00:03:08.240> been<00:03:08.630> I've<00:03:09.200> been<00:03:09.260> fidgeting<00:03:09.650> with<00:03:09.890> and

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
also been I've been fidgeting with and

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.130 
also been I've been fidgeting with and
everything<00:03:11.240> trying<00:03:11.480> to<00:03:11.630> fix<00:03:11.840> it<00:03:11.990> and

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
everything trying to fix it and

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.330 
everything trying to fix it and
everything<00:03:12.560> but<00:03:12.770> like<00:03:12.950> I<00:03:12.980> don't<00:03:13.130> think

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
everything but like I don't think

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.990 
everything but like I don't think
they're<00:03:13.460> going<00:03:13.610> to<00:03:13.670> take<00:03:13.850> it<00:03:14.060> aha<00:03:14.810> so<00:03:15.080> you<00:03:15.140> see
