00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:05.819
 hello to all the research we will do today 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.490
 as you have seen , rice milk is it 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.679
 we do at home is very simple 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.450
 very fast are various techniques I will make you 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.360
 see what I think is the most 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.000
 simple and more comfortable I tell you already that 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.640
 in the ingredients I give you only the quantity 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.590
 of water to cook rice 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.680
 obviously then you will see it in the recipe 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.150
 it will take more water will go a little 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.539
 stretched with water but that goes to 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.940
 in short, an eye to personal taste 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:34.620
 how much I like liquid or not rice 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.210
 but you will understand it anyway 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.480
 recipe then I leave you the recipe 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.280
 reminding you that completely vegan 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.660
 ideal for those who want palms for those who are 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.020
 lactose intolerant even for those 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:49.620
 he was celiac and therefore likes a certain show 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:53.940
 after the ingredients are a liter 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:57.360
 of water about 3 grams of salt 50 g of 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:00.989
 rice and the rice you want and the syrup 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:05.369
 of rice to sweeten it for those who do it 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:07.320
 he wants to sweeten then we start 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.280
 I have chosen to boil the water 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:14.490
 the water from the bottle since then 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.040
 I'll drink it all will cook the pasta in short 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.880
 then the water from the bottle and liter 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.460
 Water'll put salt and do and 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.869
 I boil it as you see the water 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:32.930
 bubbles now we take the fox rice and it 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:34.950
 we pour and let it cook 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.600
 it usually tells him more or less the 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.030
 twice as long as it says on the 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.030
 box in this case it says that 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.149
 the rice should cook in 16 minutes 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.460
 we will leave in at least half an hour then 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.000
 I cook it for at least half an hour 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.710
 anyway until everything is crushed 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.009
 after about 30 minutes 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:02:02.240
 half an hour so that 40 minutes on 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:07.009
 rice is ready it is all pulp it breaks 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:09.590
 so now we are going to blend it with 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:13.670
 the immersion blender once 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:16.280
 smoothie you can choose to adjust 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.510
 consistency of your adding milk 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.940
 water 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.390
 obviously then I will start adding 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:27.440
 here no appeal give a weight of the stop 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:31.160
 in short, it depends and amalgamate up to 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:34.640
 achieve the consistency of the milk that 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.920
 prefer over that more dense time 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.170
 you choose a lot of liquid 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.390
 so I add up to reach the 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:45.170
 consistency that I want the milk I have 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:48.470
 done is obviously a milk without without 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.720
 also ideal for making sugar 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.970
 vegan bechamel I leave you here 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:56.090
 below in the information box I leave 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:59.600
 the person and vegans have already done 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:02.650
 or anyway to drink it also in the morning vi 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:05.299
 I say that to drink it in the morning you can 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.850
 sweetened with rice syrup or 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:09.980
 which do not apply even with honey 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:12.410
 however, in short, I am pleased with you 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.780
 corner said but you can use 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:19.370
 any kind of rice you want too 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:22.100
 basmati you can do basmati not 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.380
 I advise you to use those rice that 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.540
 don't shake those scoops for 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.340
 the rice salad because you don't 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.489
 agrees because it goes scotch and the ritual 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:34.850
 in short, once you reach yours 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:37.040
 ideal consistency you can also own 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:41.200
 to remove any small lumps 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:48.740
 in short, filter the milk with a sieve 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:52.400
 so then keep it up 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:54.830
 to filter just part or milk 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.840
 fronto I repeat you let it cool a 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:01.700
 a little bit, then keep it in the fridge yes 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:06.290
 keep for 45 days quietly 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:08.150
 and here it is once the stretch the 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:11.240
 rice milk ready to go into 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:13.400
 refrigerator to cool down here I am and 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.710
 I hope you had the choice you liked 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.410
 as you have seen it is so easy if 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:20.840
 don't love it ends you can't buy it 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.610
 in short, because you can't find many 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.530
 happens if place for us we have 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.030
 nickel allergy and are few 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.130
 brands that we can eat that we don't 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.500
 contain sunflower oil 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:32.330
 Europeans are very few, so a 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.710
 sometimes it happens that another big one in 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.230
 this way where you do it 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:39.080
 and already today where you can do it 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:40.250
 both for twitter in sweets in the 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.810
 preparations from Salerno and I told you 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.030
 precisely the bÃ©chamel 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.850
 I leave you here in the information box 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:49.670
 in short, it seems somewhere around 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:51.380
 to me so we'll see soon a 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.900
 recipe I remind you that if you want you can 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.910
 subscribe to channel xvi not relevant 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:59.860
 The next recipe we see ourselves 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.860
