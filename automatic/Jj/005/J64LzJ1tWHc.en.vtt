those<00:01:05.909> lines<00:01:06.149> so<00:01:06.570> what<00:01:06.719> can<00:01:06.810> we<00:01:06.869> actually<00:01:07.049> look

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
those lines so what can we actually look

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.139 
those lines so what can we actually look
for<00:01:07.560> for<00:01:07.799> our<00:01:07.950> title<00:01:08.249> update<00:01:08.399> seven<00:01:08.909> one<00:01:09.119> point

00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:09.149 
for for our title update seven one point

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:11.060 
for for our title update seven one point
zero<00:01:09.390> point<00:01:09.810> one<00:01:10.020> so<00:01:10.439> one<00:01:10.590> of<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.770> added

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
zero point one so one of the added

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.499 
zero point one so one of the added
things<00:01:11.189> is<00:01:11.429> that<00:01:11.460> he<00:01:11.729> did<00:01:11.939> ensure<00:01:12.299> that

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:12.509 
things is that he did ensure that

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:13.910 
things is that he did ensure that
they're<00:01:12.689> going<00:01:12.929> to<00:01:13.079> change<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.469> code<00:01:13.679> to

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
they're going to change the code to

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.469 
they're going to change the code to
ensure<00:01:14.219> that<00:01:14.249> we<00:01:14.490> get<00:01:14.640> nether<00:01:14.880> fortresses

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
ensure that we get nether fortresses

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.539 
ensure that we get nether fortresses
blazes<00:01:16.289> and<00:01:16.469> nether<00:01:16.619> wart<00:01:16.890> in<00:01:17.100> any<00:01:17.340> new

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
blazes and nether wart in any new

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.429 
blazes and nether wart in any new
netherworld<00:01:18.030> so<00:01:18.569> that<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:18.810> something<00:01:18.960> really

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
netherworld so that is something really

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.679 
netherworld so that is something really
sweet<00:01:19.590> maybe<00:01:20.460> they'll<00:01:20.729> also<00:01:21.030> add<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.600> ability

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
sweet maybe they'll also add the ability

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.080 
sweet maybe they'll also add the ability
to<00:01:22.079> climb<00:01:22.319> vine<00:01:22.679> hopefully<00:01:23.549> we'll<00:01:23.729> get<00:01:23.909> that

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
to climb vine hopefully we'll get that

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.609 
to climb vine hopefully we'll get that

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.649 
going to fix the fact that we can't have
nether<00:01:54.899> fortresses<00:01:55.439> as<00:01:55.709> much<00:01:55.950> as<00:01:56.100> we<00:01:56.249> should

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
nether fortresses as much as we should

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:59.029
