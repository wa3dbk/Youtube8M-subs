bet is to find fibrous something like

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.029 
bet is to find fibrous something like
this<00:00:21.410> bark<00:00:22.460> would<00:00:23.460> work<00:00:24.019> bird<00:00:25.019> nests<00:00:25.529> feathers

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
this bark would work bird nests feathers

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.960 
this bark would work bird nests feathers
even<00:00:27.029> hear<00:00:27.710> anything<00:00:28.710> that<00:00:28.859> is<00:00:28.980> very<00:00:29.609> thin

fiber<00:00:30.539> will<00:00:31.380> catch<00:00:31.619> a<00:00:31.740> spark<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.279> become<00:00:33.270> a

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
fiber will catch a spark and become a

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.590 
fiber will catch a spark and become a
flame<00:00:33.630> pretty<00:00:34.290> soon<00:00:35.660> now<00:00:36.660> we're<00:00:37.230> looking<00:00:37.649> for

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
flame pretty soon now we're looking for

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.850 
flame pretty soon now we're looking for
for<00:00:39.600> bark<00:00:41.450> not<00:00:42.450> all<00:00:42.660> sides<00:00:43.230> of<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.500> three<00:00:43.739> are

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
for bark not all sides of the three are

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.920 
for bark not all sides of the three are
equal<00:00:44.250> usually<00:00:44.730> on<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.270> south<00:00:45.570> or<00:00:45.750> never

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
equal usually on the south or never

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.900 
equal usually on the south or never
every<00:00:46.289> sphere<00:00:46.350> then<00:00:47.629> my<00:00:48.629> face<00:00:49.670> facing<00:00:50.670> north

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
every sphere then my face facing north

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.340 
every sphere then my face facing north
is<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.210> one<00:00:51.600> is<00:00:51.690> that<00:00:51.780> that's<00:00:52.020> going<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.199> be

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
is the one is that that's going to be

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.970 
is the one is that that's going to be
more<00:00:52.710> exposed<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.899> to<00:00:54.899> sun<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.469> therefore

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
more exposed to to sun and therefore

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.810 
more exposed to to sun and therefore
more<00:00:56.420> more<00:00:57.420> dry<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:58.460> the<00:00:59.460> northern

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
more more dry and the northern

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.790 
more more dry and the northern
hemisphere<00:00:59.940> your<00:01:00.840> side<00:01:01.199> would<00:01:01.410> be<00:01:01.440> the

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
hemisphere your side would be the

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.490 
hemisphere your side would be the
southern<00:01:02.190> one<00:01:02.399> so<00:01:03.180> keep<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:03.780> in<00:01:03.960> mind<00:01:04.080> when

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
southern one so keep that in mind when

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.440 
southern one so keep that in mind when
when<00:01:05.010> picking<00:01:05.309> bark<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.700> start<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:05.970> fire<00:01:06.150> has<00:01:06.420> to

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.190 
sparks but before we get to that we have
to<00:02:17.710> make<00:02:17.860> sure<00:02:17.890> we<00:02:18.460> have<00:02:18.900> material<00:02:19.900> that<00:02:20.080> will

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
to make sure we have material that will

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:27.980 
to make sure we have material that will
catch<00:02:20.530> fire<00:02:20.860> easy<00:02:23.010> we<00:02:24.010> need<00:02:25.110> several<00:02:26.110> fibers

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
catch fire easy we need several fibers

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.770 

there<00:03:19.560> it<00:03:19.650> goes<00:03:19.890> it<00:03:20.820> sort<00:03:21.300> of<00:03:21.360> achieved

something<00:03:22.170> similar<00:03:22.890> you<00:03:25.370> want<00:03:26.370> to<00:03:26.430> have<00:03:26.550> a

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
something similar you want to have a

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.220 
something similar you want to have a
good<00:03:28.110> amount<00:03:28.290> of<00:03:28.470> all<00:03:28.800> this<00:03:29.810> so<00:03:30.810> as<00:03:31.020> to

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
good amount of all this so as to

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.000 
good amount of all this so as to
increase<00:03:31.320> the<00:03:32.250> surface<00:03:32.960> where<00:03:33.960> this<00:03:34.650> part

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
increase the surface where this part

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.530 
increase the surface where this part
will<00:03:35.220> fall<00:03:35.520> and<00:03:36.110> hopefully<00:03:37.110> catch<00:03:37.320> fire<00:03:38.540> the

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
will fall and hopefully catch fire the

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.890 
will fall and hopefully catch fire the
idea<00:03:39.810> here<00:03:40.110> is<00:03:40.290> to<00:03:40.440> turn<00:03:40.860> a<00:03:40.890> spark<00:03:41.400> into<00:03:41.700> flame

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
get more twisting and turning yeah let's

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.860 
get more twisting and turning yeah let's
give<00:03:52.230> it<00:03:52.260> a<00:03:52.380> try
