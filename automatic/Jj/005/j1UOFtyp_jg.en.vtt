00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:03.409
 look at these drugs were 

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:05.180
 voiced by people in camouflage can 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:06.529
 think of a horrible party 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:08.949
 money is like computer science club 

00:00:08.949 --> 00:00:11.249
 but there is no Moscow air club 

00:00:11.249 --> 00:00:13.049
 celebrate anniversary appearance on 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.749
 Russian market in warhead trafford 

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:17.749
 plan 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.579
 good that the club did not come all 300 thousand 

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:23.179
 virtual thugs in which 

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:25.259
 people arrange shootouts caught with 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:27.089
 so many people would probably have to 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:28.710
 rent the entire Olympic comrade 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.390
 the organizers apparently were not 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.439
 upset, I willingly shared my 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:34.510
 plans in plans grand because 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.910
 that we are planning an international tournament 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.320
 which will be held in February on 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.840
 beating at all epic 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.570
 spectacle because it's nice 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.520
 a team from all countries where it is running 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.710
 two three months and our guys will play 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.580
 of course it falls short 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:50.360
 delays 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.550
 nicely 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:53.799
 where here and now 

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:56.019
 Here it is worth holding out three 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:57.920
 victories in the party were for that 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.080
 it is not for you to sit at home still being a mouse what 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.139
 all available 

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:03.289
 two thirds of which is liberated 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:03.970
 girls 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:05.860
 today itâ€™s simply unrealistic 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.150
 understand performs the report of premiere 12 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.720
 at night 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.830
 and the people immediately suddenly got 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.140
 we very much we have two zones 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.800
 main dance floor you can watch 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.180
 who for the people dancing really settles and 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.890
 the second zone in which you can play 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.680
 there as about some forces but we tried or 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.510
 let's get the whole percent block done 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.300
 denied based on this possible 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.560
 continue the program next door or 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.030
 understand there is a special board where 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.670
 you can leave wishes flaws 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.540
 guitar and there are girls who will meet you 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.040
 which will please you 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.950
 stumble eight fell this time forward 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.729
 citizens of song and dance burning 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:51.470
 cocktails 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.720
 Nevertheless, 5 months earlier, everyone 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.630
 children parents round date 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.399
 so if you come bad like 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:59.799
 seems the spirit of the best romanian disco and 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:02.240
 everywhere computers don't go maybe 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.210
 import like and who knows 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:05.830
 maybe then you will continue 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:06.660
 holiday somewhere else
