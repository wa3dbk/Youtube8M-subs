would like to go about getting to your
tamarind<00:00:54.859> those<00:00:55.100> are<00:00:55.250> a<00:00:55.309> couple<00:00:55.370> of<00:00:55.699> different

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
tamarind those are a couple of different

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:57.970

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 
about a cup of the concentrate and a

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:02.410 
about a cup of the concentrate and a
half<00:01:00.800> a<00:01:00.949> cup<00:01:01.100> of<00:01:01.249> honey<00:01:01.429> and<00:01:01.789> I'm<00:01:01.910> bringing<00:01:02.269> it

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
half a cup of honey and I'm bringing it

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.780 
half a cup of honey and I'm bringing it
to<00:01:02.749> a<00:01:02.780> boil<00:01:03.109> here<00:01:03.440> on<00:01:03.620> the<00:01:03.710> stove<00:01:04.010> and<00:01:04.280> it's

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
to a boil here on the stove and it's

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.999 
to a boil here on the stove and it's
almost<00:01:05.089> completely<00:01:05.570> I<00:01:06.050> want<00:01:06.470> it<00:01:06.560> to<00:01:06.619> boil<00:01:06.829> all

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:07.009 
almost completely I want it to boil all

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:07.990 
almost completely I want it to boil all
the<00:01:07.100> way<00:01:07.189> through<00:01:07.400> the<00:01:07.490> center<00:01:07.790> a<00:01:07.820> nice

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
the way through the center a nice

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.880 
the way through the center a nice
rolling<00:01:08.270> boil<00:01:08.570> so<00:01:09.020> it's<00:01:09.170> kind<00:01:09.409> of<00:01:09.500> like<00:01:09.650> making

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
rolling boil so it's kind of like making

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.649 
rolling boil so it's kind of like making
a<00:01:10.159> simple<00:01:10.400> syrup<00:01:10.729> but<00:01:11.090> instead<00:01:11.390> of<00:01:11.479> using

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 
a simple syrup but instead of using

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:13.330 
a simple syrup but instead of using
water<00:01:11.930> I'm<00:01:12.259> using<00:01:12.439> the<00:01:12.650> tamarind<00:01:13.130> concentrate

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
water I'm using the tamarind concentrate

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.580 
water I'm using the tamarind concentrate
and<00:01:13.970> the<00:01:14.450> nice<00:01:14.630> thing<00:01:14.659> is<00:01:15.020> this<00:01:15.170> is<00:01:15.320> kind<00:01:15.530> of

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
and the nice thing is this is kind of

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.230 
and the nice thing is this is kind of
loaded<00:01:15.890> with<00:01:16.009> vitamin<00:01:16.430> C<00:01:16.670> and<00:01:16.909> so<00:01:17.030> if<00:01:17.119> you're

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
loaded with vitamin C and so if you're

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.120 
loaded with vitamin C and so if you're
not<00:01:17.360> feeling<00:01:17.720> so<00:01:17.869> well<00:01:18.020> throw<00:01:18.710> a<00:01:18.740> little<00:01:18.920> bit

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
not feeling so well throw a little bit

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.410 
not feeling so well throw a little bit
of<00:01:19.220> this<00:01:19.310> syrup<00:01:19.610> when<00:01:19.820> you're<00:01:19.939> done<00:01:20.060> in<00:01:20.270> your

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
of this syrup when you're done in your

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:21.760 
of this syrup when you're done in your
tea<00:01:20.600> and<00:01:20.630> you'll<00:01:20.930> feel<00:01:21.079> a<00:01:21.140> lot<00:01:21.350> better<00:01:21.500> when

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
tea and you'll feel a lot better when

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.550 
tea and you'll feel a lot better when
it's<00:01:21.979> over<00:01:22.220> so<00:01:22.610> it's<00:01:23.000> almost<00:01:23.600> ready<00:01:23.960> and

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
it's over so it's almost ready and

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.069 
it's over so it's almost ready and
because<00:01:25.460> I'm<00:01:25.579> using<00:01:25.700> honey<00:01:26.060> I<00:01:26.149> can<00:01:26.570> stir<00:01:26.960> it

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:27.079 
because I'm using honey I can stir it

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:29.260 
because I'm using honey I can stir it
and<00:01:27.259> it's<00:01:27.500> not<00:01:27.649> going<00:01:27.860> to<00:01:27.979> crystallize<00:01:28.430> which

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
and it's not going to crystallize which

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.109 
and it's not going to crystallize which
is<00:01:29.420> unlike<00:01:29.720> making<00:01:30.020> simple<00:01:30.320> syrup<00:01:30.700> and<00:01:31.700> it's
