00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.620
 hello my love welcome 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.690
 Park Street and Schlossallee my name 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.000
 is saskia from the channel saskias beauty 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.370
 blog and I show you today at high 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.900
 quoted and felt away as you yours 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:21.539
 natural curls are best for the validity 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:23.090
 can bring so stay tuned then 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.859
 we have the curls at the moment 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.170
 service cards aha freshly washed and 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.640
 the problem my bunny and in the extreme 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.570
 knotted that means I had to go now 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:36.480
 first unravel and we say so 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:40.050
 the money of l'oreal vital so 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.120
 antique sprints have them out and that 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.789
 just make sure you're better 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.050
 gets through and the hair is such a 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.700
 bit as protected 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.980
 especially because we still have them now 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.690
 through princes and wet hair 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.760
 Of course, they are always extremely sensitive 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.730
 that means we have to be very careful 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:01.199
 can be once at play and in the 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:06.240
 top and then on the approach that 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:08.180
 in the house going to distribute and then 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.650
 I use a marlies mÃ¶ller 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.030
 natural bristle brush that I find 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.840
 really very good, I use the already 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.700
 for years 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.680
 and that's the best way to do it 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.000
 clearly yes, so I know so come 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.290
 just not by my hair 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.939
 I had to be a bit too 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.740
 Because of this, always suppress the 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.939
 Brush is important just when he is 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.060
 a brush really uses that 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.460
 from the tips of the tips 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.619
 working up and being careful 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.790
 his and not with full force the 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.790
 Hair brushes through 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.030
 what I always do when I am 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:45.429
 somehow beckon to hamacher is that 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.009
 I can get my hair back 

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:50.319
 one so that I have no switch because 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.179
 I think that the waves then on 

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:54.880
 voluminous ssten and most beautiful and am 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:56.709
 most natural fall so if you the 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.110
 hair then brushed well and 

00:01:56.709 --> 00:02:00.880
 no knots we have come to look 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.859
 what I actually use always look 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.810
 we can also go for a styling 

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:06.909
 take or any special 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.780
 lure products he prefers that it 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:09.940
 not really matter 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:14.700
 depending on the effect I want you to have 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:18.459
 take from professionals is curls and shine 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:21.010
 and yes already stronger and I think that 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:23.470
 then the hair is defined out then 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.150
 or curl and not so 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.099
 I am not extremely brave, for example 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.480
 likes so much and that's why I think so 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:30.519
 product actually very good 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.099
 then I give up about a bunch 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:38.049
 my hand and distribute the whole 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:39.670
 upside down in the hair and it really is 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:42.160
 super important that you upside down 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:45.130
 make your curls as possible 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:48.489
 - and he will be a nice result 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:52.209
 do not ever forget the approach 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:54.130
 to knead otherwise you'll have it up like this 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.780
 plates approach easy and now they are 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:59.410
 if defined always always 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:04.329
 necessarily until the beginning of the whole 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:06.160
 a work and just click in like that 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:07.870
 knead her with the craft and curl 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.359
 I saw it is really that 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:13.209
 The simplest of the simple is it all 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:14.739
 important to fill your hair properly 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.000
 so either is of course if 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:16.620
 it's nice and warm outside the air 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.879
 dry read 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.920
 which of course for the hair once that 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:21.599
 The best thing is and what the hair is going on 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.640
 strained but that now again 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:25.110
 a bit colder outside it is 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.360
 usually difficult to air dry 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.250
 that's why it's very important 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.409
 we use a hair dryer with one 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.000
 diffuser so not just like that 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:35.879
 feel because then you really have 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.680
 just bush and no nice 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:40.579
 defined curls that means you need 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:43.739
 The heat is necessarily a diffuser 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:47.519
 yes, spread out a bit and enter 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:48.810
 not so strong and you 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.579
 really gets such a nice 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.730
 defined look so that's really 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:55.109
 very very important and I believe 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.030
 each one of you can be out there the 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:04:00.410
 That 's why I feel it all 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.410
 just a little bit in front of you 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:10.160
 rain inflow 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:13.880
 So make it in the movie and be ready 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:16.130
 outside red neck I have then are the 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.620
 lobby dry and then I give myself 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.300
 always like so much 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.730
 shine spree in the hair because mine 

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:24.650
 Hair is generally quite dry 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:27.500
 Every one of the nature has frizzy hair 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:30.920
 knows that this requires intensive care 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:33.530
 and that's why I use it completely 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:35.840
 Rock'n'roll likes the glamor shine 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.850
 I think that spray is very good 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.010
 very much from this place new series because 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:42.890
 the hair is really intense 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:44.900
 and yes the oil simply cares for the hair 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:46.940
 very supple and shiny 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.860
 That's why I knew that he loved it 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:53.480
 and just discuss it that way 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:55.220
 have also ugly it is likely to be part 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:05:01.300
 also super enjoyable i like the fragrant 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:01.300
 and that's the end result 

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:11.610
 so that's it with the hair tutorial i did 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.379
 Hope you liked it and if you 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.789
 even nature has frizzy hair and yours 

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:16.319
 Want to wear it again 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:19.229
 perhaps even one or the other 

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:20.789
 I 'll take care of everyone now 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:22.349
 Often times my nature try 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:24.210
 to be curious because it is easy too 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:26.099
 a lot of hair is already there and not me 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.289
 constantly want to use the flat iron 

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:31.650
 and yes, that's actually the only one 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:32.310
 walk the hair long and healthy too 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.310
 to get 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:37.229

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:40.050

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:42.229
 but I pass by these two 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.669

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:45.900
