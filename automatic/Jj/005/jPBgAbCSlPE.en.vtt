00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 hi it's alessandro you are sure 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.589
 see at the point tv then today we go 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.649
 see how to test how to do 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.120
 operate this micro serves neither too much 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.130
 headphone type so I already talked about 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.469
 micro of this type but it takes a system 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.269
 hf which is quite expensive and good for the 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.730
 operate there is a trick so if 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.230
 if so then this microphone is a micro pro 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.060
 nomic I told you that I was going 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.310
 test it is done 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.140
 it works great not bad at all 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.760
 for the price with a system so high 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.289
 frequency a system completes so is the 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.029
 small transmitter box that connects 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.439
 at the microphone plus the receiver etc 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.630
 but it's a material that can cost 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.130
 quite expensive and to make it work 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.809
 micro alone if you stay at 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.640
 inside if you make videos in 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.930
 face camera like me well you'll have 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.629
 need a carrot to do it 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.950
 to work do not laugh it's not a 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.480
 joke you actually need one 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.340
 carrot but we'll see that after the 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:55.440
 generic not this one another you 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:56.699
 go see a carrot ever so 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.289
 yes dillon yes you actually need 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.629
 a carrot but not really this model 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.129
 there rather this model then what is it 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.949
 that is that this low carrot and the 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.900
 language that this language the term that one 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.630
 what we give for this type of adapter 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.340
 it's actually a 48 volt adapter 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.220
 so here we are in the same brand the 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.470
 micro so I took that I'm going 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.090
 to test it is the pronoun milk p2 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.740
 it's the name of this adapter 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.390
 what makes this adapter and 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.479
 well he receives his son 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.280
 finally are mixed the air in 48 volts there 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.030
 so is powered 48 volts is actually 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.549
 these transform the 48 volts into 9 10 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.869
 or 7 volts depending on the type of microphone that 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.759
 you must use 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.070
 attention it is also necessary that the 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.780
 pins obviously match the 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.950
 model of your microphone here it is a 4 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.350
 pins like day systems 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.350
 exactly so the type of rock 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.509
 this is micro here prono mik so if we 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.270
 look at this year it's four pins here 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.340
 whatever he does the focus I 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.280
 will show you that a little better hop hop 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.649
 that's it's there so we have four pins 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.409
 although they will immerse themselves in this 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:04.140
 adapter see here lavanant you 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.790
 are connected with the headset microphone and 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.950
 to make it work there is more 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.319
 than to feed it with 1 48 volts then 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.489
 I took a mixer in a lycia 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.560
 old mixette but who does very well 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.840
 do it so if you 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:19.010
 in live it works so it is enough 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.690
 to plunge into the xlr system 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.220
 see here we are not very long 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.940
 obviously all depends on the length of the 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.880
 cable 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.930
 we feed 48 volts tic here nothing 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.290
 is not connected but it's for you 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.330
 show 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.130
 and then bal at the micro him can 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.019
 operate just open the gain and 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.480
 so you have a headset microphone without 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:37.640
 hf system that works from there you 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.739
 can return the sound directly into 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.450
 a camera or any device and 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.769
 it will work we will see the test 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.260
 directly because there is a small 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:47.390
 inconvenience unfortunately with this 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.610
 carrot to look at her so that's it 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.319
 is I am connected now with the 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.060
 carrot prono milk that makes me 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:54.920
 operate my headset microphone and I have 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.410
 not so systems hf 1 g this is I 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.510
 I'm wired obviously so that's it 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.010
 plan for cable drawbacks 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.630
 obviously it is that you hang out with 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.130
 it's a lot less 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.319
 practice obviously that the system hf 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.900
 but it will save you 10 times 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.849
 the price because this costs 27 euros and 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.860
 if you want a system hf by you in 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:14.420
 need at least ten times more then yes we 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.269
 has cheaper a little more expensive but 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.250
 here is at least 200 300 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:21.290
 euros to have a correct system hf 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.549
 then this costs 27 euros but 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.190
 the disadvantage you will get you 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:27.500
 account 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.700
 it generates breath then it was my 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.709
 big disappointment I told myself is this 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.569
 that the micro to a banon problem since 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:35.000
 I hated with a hf system 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:36.739
 and with his older dogs are no 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.269
 problem the microphone has no blast so 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:40.459
 it's not him that generates that's good 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:42.380
 this little carrot so that coup good 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:43.609
 yes maybe only 27 euros ago 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.440
 maybe some components that are not 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:47.900
 super top but I still find that 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.470
 for the mark prono milk and and the microphone 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.180
 prono mik 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.650
 he advises to take this thing there and 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.400
 finally you still have a microphone 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:57.350
 suddenly 70 euros which is dirty by 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.940
 this carrot at 30 euros which generates 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.620
 blow then there's no secret there is 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.959
 40 more expensive there are tricks 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.700
 ok but not all are compatible 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:06.799
 I really took the same model that 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.950
 works with that so it does not matter 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:11.660
 the breath of course watch it observe 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.489
 is removed but the quality of the shot is 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.569
 not the same and I find that beats for the 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:16.160
 price he could have made an effort at this 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:17.989
 level there are carrots for 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.729
 information up to 250 euros 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.970
 in particular day systems in line 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:24.010
 audin 90 and 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.230
 the 250 there I see more really 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.240
 the interest of using that is not for 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.040
 really do a test 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.900
 so here's the disadvantage wii will you 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.520
 to be bound a son advantage you will not have 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.170
 need batteries every time so if 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.990
 you can test pickups or 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:39.520
 operate in the style room 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.720
 conference that's fine then 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.830
 another little advice is 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.290
 of course we see you there I have that 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.340
 hand then here it hides its 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.110
 week in a pocket 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.060
 some carrots are equipped with 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:52.360
 clips for you clip is at the waist 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.780
 and as it's worth you could have you in 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.010
 worry 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.600
 but you still have to stay pretty 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.710
 so fixed for the camera side it can 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.570
 to be fine if you really have 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.970
 need this type of headset then is 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.620
 for the comparison I left the microphone 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:04.240
 tie will watch a game will make a small 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.070
 test I will show you sometimes on 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.200
 intent on each other with and his 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:10.090
 blast you will see again also the 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.740
 difference in sound quality that one 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.540
 can then find in a next 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.220
 video I will show you another headset 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.960
 like this one but that costs much less 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:20.380
 dear I was still blown away by the 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.600
 quality and thanks to this little prono mixa 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:23.560
 also works so 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.419
 so here is bessat go in a 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.770
 next video in the meantime let me 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:28.750
 your reactions do not hesitate to you 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.190
 Subscribe join me on the blog asking 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:31.510
 me your questions and in the meantime I 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:35.550
 See you soon for 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:35.550
 new videos on your big tv points
