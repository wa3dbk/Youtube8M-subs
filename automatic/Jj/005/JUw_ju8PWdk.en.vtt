here's<00:00:03.210> the<00:00:03.600> Casilla<00:00:04.049> mini<00:00:04.350> quad<00:00:04.620> I<00:00:04.650> picked<00:00:05.070> up

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
here's the Casilla mini quad I picked up

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.079 
here's the Casilla mini quad I picked up
four<00:00:05.490> or<00:00:06.480> three<00:00:06.540> of<00:00:06.960> them<00:00:07.219> for<00:00:08.219> our<00:00:08.820> 60<00:00:09.329> bucks

00:00:11.079 --> 00:00:11.089 
four or three of them for our 60 bucks

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:13.999 
four or three of them for our 60 bucks
so<00:00:12.089> it<00:00:12.269> works<00:00:12.450> out<00:00:12.690> to<00:00:12.719> be<00:00:12.869> about<00:00:13.110> 30<00:00:13.709> bucks

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
so it works out to be about 30 bucks

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:14.589 
so it works out to be about 30 bucks
apiece

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:14.599 
apiece

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:18.650 
apiece
because<00:00:15.599> this<00:00:16.199> one<00:00:16.439> is<00:00:16.470> trash<00:00:17.330> there's<00:00:18.330> no<00:00:18.539> way

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
because this one is trash there's no way

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.450 
because this one is trash there's no way

gas tank wiring harness needs to be
redone<00:00:34.430> but<00:00:35.430> it<00:00:35.610> does<00:00:35.760> have<00:00:35.940> spark<00:00:36.240> just<00:00:37.160> and

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
redone but it does have spark just and

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.890 
redone but it does have spark just and
starter<00:00:38.610> motor<00:00:38.790> does<00:00:39.030> work<00:00:39.270> so<00:00:39.480> it's<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.750> matter

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:39.900 
starter motor does work so it's a matter

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.990 
starter motor does work so it's a matter
of<00:00:40.020> just<00:00:40.230> connecting<00:00:40.470> the<00:00:40.860> all<00:00:41.310> up<00:00:43.610> does<00:00:44.610> have

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
of just connecting the all up does have

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.950 
of just connecting the all up does have
some<00:00:45.570> come<00:00:45.900> fresh<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:47.150> the<00:00:48.150> carb<00:00:48.420> is<00:00:48.570> trash

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
some come fresh and the carb is trash

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.680 
some come fresh and the carb is trash

lot<00:01:01.590> of<00:01:01.620> work<00:01:03.379> going<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.500> turn<00:01:04.650> into<00:01:04.800> a<00:01:04.949> premix

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
lot of work going to turn into a premix

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.360 
lot of work going to turn into a premix
instead<00:01:06.510> of<00:01:06.600> using<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.960> will<00:01:07.080> pump<00:01:07.290> which<00:01:07.920> is

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:08.370 
instead of using the will pump which is

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.980 
instead of using the will pump which is
really<00:01:08.820> junky<00:01:09.480> on<00:01:09.750> these<00:01:09.900> bikes<00:01:11.810> but<00:01:12.810> hey

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
really junky on these bikes but hey

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.620 
really junky on these bikes but hey
don't<00:01:13.470> spark<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.670> I<00:01:14.730> get<00:01:14.910> air<00:01:15.120> going<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.510> get

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
don't spark and I get air going to get

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.790 
don't spark and I get air going to get
fuel<00:01:15.900> should<00:01:16.800> go<00:01:16.980> should<00:01:17.790> be<00:01:17.909> fine

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:18.800 
fuel should go should be fine

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.920 
fuel should go should be fine
but<00:01:19.800> anyways<00:01:20.220> been<00:01:20.940> working<00:01:21.270> for<00:01:21.450> about<00:01:21.630> three

weeks now on this one and got it up and
running<00:01:26.400> as<00:01:26.670> of<00:01:27.030> today<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:28.909> it<00:01:29.909> does<00:01:30.200> work<00:01:31.200> now

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
running as of today and it does work now

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.490 
running as of today and it does work now
as<00:01:32.040> far<00:01:32.310> as<00:01:32.550> this<00:01:33.360> is<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:33.630> kill<00:01:33.840> switch<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.350> key

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
as far as this is a kill switch the key

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.710 
as far as this is a kill switch the key
does<00:01:34.680> work<00:01:34.890> read<00:01:35.790> it<00:01:35.940> the<00:01:36.090> wiring<00:01:36.420> for<00:01:36.600> all

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
does work read it the wiring for all

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.330 
does work read it the wiring for all
that<00:01:38.659> clean<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.780> carb<00:01:39.990> up<00:01:40.140> pilot<00:01:41.040> jet<00:01:41.190> was

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
that clean the carb up pilot jet was

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:48.160 
that clean the carb up pilot jet was
really<00:01:42.030> just<00:01:42.420> stuffed<00:01:42.990> up<00:01:43.729> major<00:01:44.729> it<00:01:44.909> was<00:01:45.030> okay

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.850 

then<00:01:48.950> I<00:01:48.979> worked<00:01:49.400> on<00:01:49.549> the<00:01:49.670> wiring<00:01:50.470> you<00:01:51.470> know<00:01:51.590> the

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
then I worked on the wiring you know the

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.200 
then I worked on the wiring you know the
this<00:01:52.790> one<00:01:53.030> had<00:01:53.650> initially<00:01:54.650> a<00:01:55.340> bad<00:01:55.820> starter

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
this one had initially a bad starter

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:02.969 
this one had initially a bad starter
motor<00:01:56.420> and<00:01:58.960> that's<00:01:59.960> threw<00:02:00.140> me<00:02:00.259> for<00:02:00.290> a<00:02:00.470> loop<00:02:00.500> and

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.630 

the<00:02:03.979> wiring<00:02:05.440> work<00:02:06.440> mainly<00:02:06.920> went<00:02:07.130> to<00:02:07.310> that<00:02:07.490> the

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
the wiring work mainly went to that the

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.510 
the wiring work mainly went to that the
CD<00:02:07.909> has<00:02:08.030> good<00:02:08.300> ignition<00:02:08.929> clothes<00:02:09.110> good<00:02:09.410> so<00:02:10.100> it

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
CD has good ignition clothes good so it

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.890 
CD has good ignition clothes good so it
does<00:02:10.729> fire<00:02:11.030> and<00:02:11.860> got<00:02:12.860> air<00:02:13.069> got<00:02:13.280> fuel

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
does fire and got air got fuel

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.990 
does fire and got air got fuel
disconnect<00:02:14.900> at<00:02:15.019> the<00:02:15.200> oil<00:02:15.860> pump<00:02:16.130> because

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
disconnect at the oil pump because

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:25.740 
disconnect at the oil pump because
what's<00:02:17.239> flooding<00:02:17.690> the<00:02:17.780> engine<00:02:19.780> and

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.240 

everything<00:02:26.750> seems<00:02:27.080> to<00:02:27.200> be<00:02:27.319> working<00:02:27.440> now<00:02:27.980> I

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
everything seems to be working now I

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.630 
everything seems to be working now I
just<00:02:28.549> drew<00:02:29.209> you<00:02:29.239> bricked<00:02:29.660> a<00:02:30.640> battery

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
just drew you bricked a battery

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.039 
just drew you bricked a battery
connector<00:02:32.090> for<00:02:32.330> now<00:02:32.650> but<00:02:33.650> but<00:02:34.040> it<00:02:34.160> does<00:02:34.280> work

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.049 
connector for now but but it does work

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:38.830 
connector for now but but it does work
so<00:02:36.049> once<00:02:36.319> I<00:02:36.640> clean<00:02:37.640> it<00:02:37.670> up<00:02:37.910> get<00:02:38.630> everything

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
so once I clean it up get everything

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.009 
so once I clean it up get everything
back<00:02:39.230> on<00:02:39.440> secure<00:02:40.100> everything<00:02:40.720> now<00:02:41.720> if<00:02:41.930> you

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
back on secure everything now if you

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:44.350 
back on secure everything now if you
can't<00:02:42.230> lose

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
can't lose

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.740 
can't lose
oh<00:02:44.739> the<00:02:45.739> choke<00:02:46.010> I<00:02:46.310> have<00:02:47.000> no<00:02:47.209> idea<00:02:47.480> what<00:02:47.660> I'm

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
oh the choke I have no idea what I'm

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:54.729 
oh the choke I have no idea what I'm
going<00:02:47.900> to<00:02:47.959> do<00:02:48.080> with<00:02:48.230> that<00:02:48.310> but<00:02:53.079> the<00:02:54.079> rest<00:02:54.650> of

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
going to do with that but the rest of

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:55.840
