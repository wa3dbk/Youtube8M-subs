controller and a hybrid controller well
the<00:00:27.360> biggest<00:00:27.660> difference<00:00:27.900> between<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:29.060> normal

normal hard light controller and the

respected in the power pointless now if

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.500 
respected in the power pointless now if
we<00:00:37.290> go<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.650> powerpoints<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:38.610> I<00:00:39.329> will<00:00:39.480> show

you what it means what it means by

specializing in a poetry simply put it

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.170 
specializing in a poetry simply put it
means<00:00:45.870> which<00:00:46.860> tree<00:00:47.190> do<00:00:47.340> I<00:00:47.400> have<00:00:47.670> more<00:00:47.910> power

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
means which tree do I have more power

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.240 
means which tree do I have more power
points<00:00:48.540> in<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.840> what<00:00:49.440> benefits<00:00:49.620> do<00:00:49.950> I<00:00:50.010> get

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
points in and what benefits do I get

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.820 
points in and what benefits do I get
from<00:00:50.460> it<00:00:50.990> now<00:00:51.990> as<00:00:52.140> you<00:00:52.290> can<00:00:52.410> see<00:00:52.470> in<00:00:52.800> your

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:52.830 
from it now as you can see in your

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.370 
from it now as you can see in your
sultry<00:00:53.280> I'm<00:00:53.550> pretty<00:00:54.030> much<00:00:54.090> SPECT<00:00:54.480> as<00:00:54.720> a<00:00:54.780> normal

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:55.380 
sultry I'm pretty much SPECT as a normal

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:01.910 
sultry I'm pretty much SPECT as a normal
hard<00:00:55.980> light<00:00:56.190> DPS<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:58.940> your<00:00:59.940> sultry<00:01:00.270> I<00:01:00.920> just

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
hard light DPS and your sultry I just

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.210 
hard light DPS and your sultry I just
have<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.370> two<00:01:03.439> power<00:01:04.439> points<00:01:04.589> just<00:01:05.009> so<00:01:05.100> i<00:01:05.129> can

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
have the two power points just so i can

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.070 
have the two power points just so i can
get<00:01:05.430> recharged

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.270 

now<00:01:08.440> since<00:01:09.070> I<00:01:09.190> have<00:01:09.220> more<00:01:09.550> power<00:01:10.270> points<00:01:10.600> in

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
now since I have more power points in

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.640 
now since I have more power points in
the<00:01:12.280> sultry<00:01:12.940> I'm<00:01:13.210> actually<00:01:13.530> specializing<00:01:14.530> in

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:14.650 
the sultry I'm actually specializing in

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.470 
the sultry I'm actually specializing in
your<00:01:14.860> sultry<00:01:15.190> so<00:01:15.400> I<00:01:15.430> get<00:01:15.640> the<00:01:15.730> additional<00:01:15.910> one

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:16.480 
your sultry so I get the additional one

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.420 
your sultry so I get the additional one
percent<00:01:16.750> critical<00:01:17.110> chance<00:01:17.290> and<00:01:17.590> extra<00:01:18.070> 35

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430 
percent critical chance and extra 35

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:24.030 
percent critical chance and extra 35
power<00:01:21.300> so<00:01:22.300> since<00:01:22.540> i<00:01:22.630> don't<00:01:23.020> have<00:01:23.170> the<00:01:23.680> main

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
power so since i don't have the main

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.340 
power so since i don't have the main
since<00:01:24.850> i<00:01:24.910> don't<00:01:25.000> have<00:01:25.150> more<00:01:25.720> power<00:01:25.900> points<00:01:26.200> in

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
since i don't have more power points in

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.530 
since i don't have more power points in
this<00:01:26.490> support<00:01:27.490> tree<00:01:27.640> I<00:01:27.820> don't<00:01:28.270> get<00:01:28.390> the

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
this support tree I don't get the

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.120 
this support tree I don't get the
additional<00:01:28.720> five<00:01:29.200> percent<00:01:29.500> credit<00:01:29.800> app<00:01:29.890> and

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
additional five percent credit app and

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.780 
additional five percent credit app and
10<00:01:30.970> bit<00:01:31.210> so<00:01:31.480> the<00:01:31.600> main<00:01:31.780> difference<00:01:32.230> between

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
10 bit so the main difference between

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.680 
10 bit so the main difference between
the<00:01:35.310> normal<00:01:36.310> controller<00:01:36.730> for<00:01:37.180> hard<00:01:37.330> light<00:01:37.510> and

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
the normal controller for hard light and

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.680 
the normal controller for hard light and
a<00:01:37.930> hyper<00:01:38.110> controller<00:01:38.470> is<00:01:38.800> to<00:01:39.100> simply<00:01:39.460> 10<00:01:39.910> vit<00:01:40.150> I

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.390 

have<00:01:43.690> 10<00:01:43.900> bit<00:01:44.080> less<00:01:44.260> than<00:01:44.590> men<00:01:44.920> controllers

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 
have 10 bit less than men controllers

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.420 
have 10 bit less than men controllers
but<00:01:45.820> since<00:01:46.660> I'm<00:01:46.780> hybrid<00:01:47.170> it<00:01:47.710> allows<00:01:48.010> me<00:01:48.280> to

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
but since I'm hybrid it allows me to

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:54.270 
but since I'm hybrid it allows me to
function<00:01:49.830> two<00:01:50.830> roles<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:52.920> at<00:01:53.920> the<00:01:54.070> same<00:01:54.220> time

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
function two roles and at the same time

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.020 
function two roles and at the same time
pretty<00:01:54.700> much<00:01:56.100> even<00:01:57.100> when<00:01:57.369> I'm<00:01:57.610> trollin

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
pretty much even when I'm trollin

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.910 
pretty much even when I'm trollin
trollin<00:01:58.240> I<00:01:59.020> can<00:01:59.229> still<00:01:59.410> put<00:01:59.560> up<00:01:59.590> some<00:01:59.800> good

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
trollin I can still put up some good

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.520 
trollin I can still put up some good
damage<00:02:00.250> because<00:02:00.550> I<00:02:00.729> have<00:02:00.910> the<00:02:01.060> combos<00:02:01.530> from

just<00:04:57.650> after<00:04:57.770> the<00:04:59.439> compost<00:05:00.439> and<00:05:00.650> the<00:05:00.800> only

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:00.889 
just after the compost and the only

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:02.640 
just after the compost and the only
power<00:05:01.099> I<00:05:01.219> use<00:05:01.430> to<00:05:01.610> start<00:05:01.819> the<00:05:01.879> whole<00:05:01.999> thing<00:05:02.029> off

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
power I use to start the whole thing off

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.610 
power I use to start the whole thing off
would<00:05:03.650> have<00:05:03.740> been<00:05:03.830> like<00:05:03.949> claws

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.500

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.940 

so<00:05:11.510> that's<00:05:11.690> pretty<00:05:11.930> much<00:05:12.110> the<00:05:12.169> main<00:05:12.530> reason

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:12.950 
so that's pretty much the main reason

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:16.450 
so that's pretty much the main reason
and<00:05:13.510> the<00:05:14.510> difference<00:05:14.870> between<00:05:15.080> a<00:05:15.620> hard<00:05:16.160> lights

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
and the difference between a hard lights

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:21.129 
and the difference between a hard lights
a<00:05:17.500> hybrid<00:05:18.500> controller<00:05:18.889> and<00:05:19.840> a<00:05:20.840> regular

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:21.139 
a hybrid controller and a regular

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:23.770 
a hybrid controller and a regular
controller<00:05:21.410> is<00:05:21.710> just<00:05:21.950> a<00:05:22.040> 10-bit<00:05:22.660> that<00:05:23.660> the

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:23.780 
controller is just a 10-bit that the

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.500 
controller is just a 10-bit that the
main<00:05:23.930> controller<00:05:24.260> would<00:05:24.410> get<00:05:25.510> probably

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:26.510 
main controller would get probably

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:33.640 
main controller would get probably
expecting<00:05:26.960> the<00:05:27.560> support<00:05:28.460> tree<00:05:29.110> and<00:05:32.380> that's<00:05:33.380> it

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:33.650 
expecting the support tree and that's it

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.800 
expecting the support tree and that's it
the<00:05:34.370> hard<00:05:34.520> light<00:05:34.700> roller<00:05:34.970> may<00:05:35.270> have<00:05:35.389> 10<00:05:35.600> that's

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.810 
the hard light roller may have 10 that's

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:39.070 
the hard light roller may have 10 that's
fit<00:05:35.990> but<00:05:36.530> we're<00:05:36.710> able<00:05:36.889> to<00:05:37.100> control<00:05:37.400> adds<00:05:37.639> a<00:05:38.080> lot

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 
fit but we're able to control adds a lot

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.870 
fit but we're able to control adds a lot
better<00:05:39.290> without<00:05:40.160> using<00:05:40.690> that<00:05:41.690> much<00:05:41.840> power

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 
better without using that much power

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.830 
better without using that much power
plus<00:05:43.880> we<00:05:44.030> can<00:05:44.060> also<00:05:44.240> fill<00:05:44.419> up<00:05:44.510> some<00:05:44.630> code

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:44.840 
plus we can also fill up some code

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.320 
plus we can also fill up some code
damage<00:05:45.200> so<00:05:46.190> if<00:05:46.610> you<00:05:46.729> have<00:05:46.850> any<00:05:46.970> comments
