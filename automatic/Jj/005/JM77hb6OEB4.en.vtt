a<00:00:27.480> lot<00:00:28.439> of<00:00:28.590> you<00:00:28.710> probably<00:00:29.039> won't<00:00:29.189> know<00:00:29.400> what

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
a lot of you probably won't know what

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.380 
a lot of you probably won't know what
the<00:00:29.699> hell<00:00:29.820> this<00:00:29.939> thing<00:00:30.000> is

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
the hell this thing is

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.500 
the hell this thing is
because<00:00:31.019> it's<00:00:31.679> very<00:00:32.130> very<00:00:32.640> rare<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.000> was<00:00:33.360> only

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
because it's very very rare and was only

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.400 
because it's very very rare and was only
sold<00:00:33.870> for<00:00:34.079> a<00:00:34.110> short<00:00:34.440> time<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:34.980> I<00:00:35.100> believe<00:00:35.360> 1991

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
sold for a short time and I believe 1991

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.650 
sold for a short time and I believe 1991
if<00:00:37.410> I'm<00:00:37.680> not<00:00:37.800> mistaken<00:00:38.309> these<00:00:39.059> were<00:00:39.210> only<00:00:39.329> sold

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
if I'm not mistaken these were only sold

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.209 
if I'm not mistaken these were only sold
for<00:00:39.899> like<00:00:40.020> four<00:00:40.379> months<00:00:40.530> I<00:00:40.770> think<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.160> they

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
for like four months I think and they

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.200 
for like four months I think and they
only<00:00:41.460> made<00:00:41.730> 10,000<00:00:42.420> units<00:00:42.860> so<00:00:43.860> having<00:00:44.550> this<00:00:44.850> is

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
only made 10,000 units so having this is

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.869 
only made 10,000 units so having this is
very<00:00:45.840> cool<00:00:46.110> because<00:00:46.410> I<00:00:46.890> have<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.280> very<00:00:47.579> rare

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
very cool because I have a very rare

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.270 
very cool because I have a very rare
computer<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.660> lot<00:00:49.260> of<00:00:49.379> them<00:00:49.530> are<00:00:49.770> broken<00:00:49.980> or

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
computer a lot of them are broken or

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.790 
computer a lot of them are broken or
dead<00:00:50.460> these<00:00:50.670> days<00:00:52.370> as<00:00:53.370> far<00:00:53.670> as<00:00:53.789> I<00:00:53.910> know<00:00:53.969> for

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
dead these days as far as I know for

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.740 
dead these days as far as I know for
specifications<00:00:55.800> I'm<00:00:55.949> not<00:00:56.129> entirely<00:00:56.520> sure<00:00:56.750> on

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
specifications I'm not entirely sure on

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.430 
specifications I'm not entirely sure on
what<00:00:57.809> this<00:00:58.199> has<00:00:58.379> I<00:00:58.530> know<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.739> has<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:58.890> motorola

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
what this has I know it has a motorola

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.329 
what this has I know it has a motorola
68030<00:01:02.449> that<00:01:03.449> has<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:03.600> motorola<00:01:04.170> 68000<00:01:05.070> that<00:01:05.189> is

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
68030 that has a motorola 68000 that is

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.980 
68030 that has a motorola 68000 that is
a<00:01:05.489> Macintosh<00:01:06.119> se<00:01:07.340> and<00:01:08.340> then<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:09.360> think<00:01:09.570> this<00:01:09.720> has

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
a Macintosh se and then I think this has

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.539 
a Macintosh se and then I think this has
somewhere<00:01:10.680> between<00:01:10.799> five<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.280> eight

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
somewhere between five and eight

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.660 
somewhere between five and eight
megabytes<00:01:12.090> of<00:01:12.210> RAM<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:13.350> has<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.670> 160

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
megabytes of RAM and it has a 160

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.149 
megabytes of RAM and it has a 160
megabyte<00:01:15.330> hard<00:01:15.570> drive<00:01:15.770> yeah<00:01:16.770> you<00:01:16.830> heard<00:01:17.100> me

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
megabyte hard drive yeah you heard me

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.880 
megabyte hard drive yeah you heard me
right<00:01:17.340> that's<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.790> megabyte<00:01:18.180> it<00:01:18.900> also<00:01:19.049> has<00:01:19.380> an

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
right that's a megabyte it also has an

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.640 
right that's a megabyte it also has an
optical<00:01:20.610> drive<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.600> 3.5<00:01:22.290> inch<00:01:22.560> floppy

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
optical drive and a 3.5 inch floppy

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.270 
optical drive and a 3.5 inch floppy
drive<00:01:23.250> now<00:01:24.240> this<00:01:24.540> computer<00:01:25.049> was<00:01:25.890> basically

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
drive now this computer was basically

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.280 
drive now this computer was basically
meant<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.549> be<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.670> computer<00:01:27.240> with<00:01:27.420> television

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
meant to be a computer with television

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.760 
meant to be a computer with television
capabilities<00:01:28.950> it<00:01:29.490> has<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.759> TV<00:01:30.119> tuner<00:01:30.560> on<00:01:31.560> the

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
capabilities it has a TV tuner on the

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.410 
capabilities it has a TV tuner on the
back<00:01:31.979> of<00:01:32.189> it<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.549> you<00:01:32.670> could<00:01:32.850> plug<00:01:33.060> it<00:01:33.240> into

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
back of it and you could plug it into

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.170 
back of it and you could plug it into
your<00:01:33.840> coax<00:01:34.290> in<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.799> wall<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.310> it<00:01:36.000> had<00:01:36.150> a

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
your coax in the wall and it had a

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.580 
your coax in the wall and it had a
little<00:01:36.329> remote<00:01:36.750> that<00:01:36.960> you<00:01:37.020> could<00:01:37.229> switch<00:01:37.439> the

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
little remote that you could switch the

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.080 
little remote that you could switch the
mode<00:01:37.740> on<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.070> you<00:01:38.159> can<00:01:38.280> watch<00:01:38.490> TV<00:01:38.759> on<00:01:38.970> your

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
mode on and you can watch TV on your

mode on and you can watch TV on your
computer

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
computer

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.080 
computer
it<00:01:40.710> wasn't<00:01:41.009> like<00:01:41.100> window<00:01:41.549> though<00:01:41.759> it<00:01:41.939> was

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
it wasn't like window though it was

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.990 
it wasn't like window though it was
either<00:01:42.210> TV<00:01:42.780> or<00:01:43.020> computer<00:01:43.170> so<00:01:43.909> kind<00:01:44.909> of

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
either TV or computer so kind of

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.370 
either TV or computer so kind of
primitive<00:01:45.180> for<00:01:45.600> its<00:01:45.720> time<00:01:45.899> but<00:01:46.079> this<00:01:46.200> was

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
primitive for its time but this was

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.289 
primitive for its time but this was
Apple's<00:01:46.710> first<00:01:46.950> attempt<00:01:47.460> at<00:01:47.549> bringing<00:01:47.729> TV

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
Apple's first attempt at bringing TV

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.850 
Apple's first attempt at bringing TV
capabilities<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.229> computer<00:01:50.960> this<00:01:51.960> one<00:01:52.200> is<00:01:52.439> a

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
capabilities to a computer this one is a

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.399 
capabilities to a computer this one is a
little<00:01:53.670> rough<00:01:53.909> it<00:01:54.149> does<00:01:54.299> have<00:01:54.479> a<00:01:54.509> crack<00:01:54.930> up

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
little rough it does have a crack up

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.660 
little rough it does have a crack up
here<00:01:56.840> but<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:57.960> does<00:01:58.170> it's<00:01:58.530> pretty<00:01:59.399> functional

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
here but it does it's pretty functional

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.959 
here but it does it's pretty functional
it<00:02:00.390> works<00:02:00.710> and<00:02:01.710> you<00:02:01.829> can<00:02:01.950> see<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.399> form<00:02:02.790> factor

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
it works and you can see the form factor

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.480 
it works and you can see the form factor
is<00:02:03.210> kind<00:02:03.509> of<00:02:03.600> weird<00:02:03.780> it's<00:02:04.079> basically<00:02:04.710> this

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
is kind of weird it's basically this

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.389 
is kind of weird it's basically this
computer<00:02:05.909> is<00:02:06.030> basically<00:02:06.210> a<00:02:06.540> macintosh<00:02:07.110> LC<00:02:07.399> 520

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
computer is basically a macintosh LC 520

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.840 
computer is basically a macintosh LC 520
if<00:02:08.520> I'm<00:02:08.640> not<00:02:08.729> mistaken<00:02:09.440> same<00:02:10.440> form<00:02:10.709> factor<00:02:10.920> but

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
if I'm not mistaken same form factor but

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.570 
if I'm not mistaken same form factor but
like<00:02:11.970> I<00:02:12.000> said<00:02:12.150> this<00:02:12.420> had<00:02:12.540> TV<00:02:12.870> capabilities

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
like I said this had TV capabilities

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.500 
like I said this had TV capabilities
very<00:02:14.580> rare<00:02:14.820> computer<00:02:16.280> it<00:02:17.280> does<00:02:17.580> work<00:02:17.910> but

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
very rare computer it does work but

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.070 
very rare computer it does work but
there<00:02:19.350> is<00:02:19.800> no<00:02:20.190> operating<00:02:21.150> system<00:02:21.240> loaded<00:02:21.960> on

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
there is no operating system loaded on

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.170 
there is no operating system loaded on
here<00:02:22.470> so<00:02:22.830> I<00:02:23.250> can't<00:02:23.910> really<00:02:24.090> use<00:02:24.720> it<00:02:24.900> yet

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
here so I can't really use it yet

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.260 
here so I can't really use it yet
I'm<00:02:27.180> tried<00:02:27.420> to<00:02:27.600> make<00:02:27.780> floppies<00:02:28.770> for<00:02:29.580> Mac<00:02:29.910> OS

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
I'm tried to make floppies for Mac OS

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.420 
system 7 but it wasn't working I don't
know<00:02:34.140> if<00:02:34.230> I<00:02:34.320> have<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:34.620> right<00:02:34.740> image<00:02:34.980> so<00:02:35.340> I'm

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.210 
know if I have the right image so I'm
still<00:02:35.670> working<00:02:35.790> on<00:02:36.150> that<00:02:36.330> but<00:02:36.600> I<00:02:37.410> don't<00:02:37.980> know

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
still working on that but I don't know

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.650 
still working on that but I don't know
someday<00:02:38.640> we'll<00:02:38.850> get<00:02:39.000> this<00:02:39.150> thing<00:02:39.210> up<00:02:39.510> and

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
someday we'll get this thing up and

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.620 
someday we'll get this thing up and
running<00:02:40.250> but<00:02:41.250> yeah<00:02:41.460> very<00:02:41.880> cool<00:02:42.180> computer

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
running but yeah very cool computer

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.080 
running but yeah very cool computer
macintosh<00:02:43.470> TV<00:02:43.980> as<00:02:44.310> you<00:02:44.430> can<00:02:44.550> see<00:02:44.730> down<00:02:44.880> there

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
macintosh TV as you can see down there

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.370 
macintosh TV as you can see down there
we<00:02:45.300> have<00:02:45.450> some<00:02:45.630> volume<00:02:46.080> and<00:02:46.230> brightness

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
we have some volume and brightness

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.420 
we have some volume and brightness
adjustment<00:02:47.070> we<00:02:47.400> have<00:02:47.550> a<00:02:48.050> headphone<00:02:49.050> jack<00:02:49.430> and

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
adjustment we have a headphone jack and

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.860 
adjustment we have a headphone jack and
then<00:02:50.730> i'm<00:02:50.940> not<00:02:50.970> gonna<00:02:51.150> move<00:02:51.570> it<00:02:51.780> around

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
then i'm not gonna move it around

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.970 
then i'm not gonna move it around
because<00:02:52.530> it's<00:02:52.680> very<00:02:52.950> heavy<00:02:53.280> but<00:02:53.610> on<00:02:53.940> the<00:02:54.570> back

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
because it's very heavy but on the back

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:00.230 
because it's very heavy but on the back
we<00:02:55.980> have<00:02:56.010> a<00:02:56.790> few<00:02:57.120> ports<00:02:58.370> and<00:02:59.370> there's<00:02:59.910> a<00:03:00.030> couple

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
we have a few ports and there's a couple

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.830 
we have a few ports and there's a couple
apple<00:03:00.720> desktop<00:03:00.870> bus<00:03:01.440> ports<00:03:02.070> and<00:03:02.280> such<00:03:02.840> there's

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
apple desktop bus ports and such there's

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.260 
apple desktop bus ports and such there's
a<00:03:03.900> serial<00:03:04.410> there's<00:03:04.590> a<00:03:04.650> parallel<00:03:05.040> and<00:03:05.460> there's

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
a serial there's a parallel and there's

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.670 
a serial there's a parallel and there's
also<00:03:06.420> that<00:03:06.720> TV<00:03:07.140> out<00:03:08.390> you<00:03:09.390> know<00:03:09.510> coaxial<00:03:10.500> as<00:03:10.650> I

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
also that TV out you know coaxial as I

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.850 
also that TV out you know coaxial as I
mentioned<00:03:11.190> before<00:03:11.900> it's<00:03:12.900> kind<00:03:13.530> of<00:03:13.620> hard<00:03:13.800> to

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
mentioned before it's kind of hard to

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.230 
mentioned before it's kind of hard to
maneuver<00:03:14.190> this<00:03:14.280> thing<00:03:14.520> around<00:03:14.790> it<00:03:14.940> because<00:03:15.150> it

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
maneuver this thing around it because it

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:22.220 
maneuver this thing around it because it
is<00:03:15.360> so<00:03:15.570> heavy<00:03:15.840> but<00:03:17.480> yeah<00:03:19.790> but<00:03:20.790> anyway<00:03:21.180> and<00:03:22.050> I

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
is so heavy but yeah but anyway and I

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.500 
is so heavy but yeah but anyway and I
think<00:03:22.640> that's<00:03:23.640> gonna<00:03:23.820> be<00:03:24.000> have<00:03:24.180> to<00:03:24.210> be<00:03:24.390> good

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
think that's gonna be have to be good

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.530 
think that's gonna be have to be good
enough<00:03:24.720> for<00:03:24.900> now<00:03:24.990> so<00:03:25.950> I<00:03:26.250> don't<00:03:26.760> know<00:03:27.030> let's<00:03:27.420> go

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
enough for now so I don't know let's go

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.790 
enough for now so I don't know let's go
ahead<00:03:27.690> and<00:03:27.980> turn<00:03:28.980> it<00:03:29.130> on<00:03:29.330> I'm<00:03:30.380> not<00:03:31.380> gonna<00:03:31.590> boot

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
ahead and turn it on I'm not gonna boot

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.590 
ahead and turn it on I'm not gonna boot
it<00:03:31.920> up<00:03:32.010> obviously<00:03:32.280> because<00:03:32.760> like<00:03:33.030> I<00:03:33.060> said<00:03:33.210> it

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
it up obviously because like I said it

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.920 
it up obviously because like I said it
does<00:03:33.720> not<00:03:33.870> have<00:03:34.080> any<00:03:34.850> in<00:03:35.850> operating<00:03:36.390> system<00:03:36.810> on

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
does not have any in operating system on

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.480 
does not have any in operating system on
it<00:03:37.110> as<00:03:37.230> far<00:03:37.410> as<00:03:37.470> I<00:03:37.680> know<00:03:37.740> I<00:03:37.890> don't<00:03:38.220> even<00:03:38.310> know<00:03:38.460> if

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:38.490 
it as far as I know I don't even know if

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.240 
it as far as I know I don't even know if
the<00:03:38.670> hard<00:03:38.850> drive<00:03:38.940> works<00:03:39.240> in<00:03:39.480> this<00:03:39.570> thing<00:03:39.840> so<00:03:40.680> we

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
the hard drive works in this thing so we

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.310 
the hard drive works in this thing so we
will<00:03:41.430> find<00:03:41.640> out<00:03:41.910> let's<00:03:42.390> go<00:03:42.540> ahead<00:03:42.630> and<00:03:42.840> power

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
will find out let's go ahead and power

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.900 
will find out let's go ahead and power
button

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:55.190 

very<00:03:48.020> quiet<00:03:49.020> boot<00:03:49.350> chime<00:03:51.350> basically<00:03:54.080> there<00:03:55.080> it

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
very quiet boot chime basically there it

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.250 
very quiet boot chime basically there it
is<00:03:55.320> coming<00:03:56.250> to<00:03:56.430> life<00:03:56.610> ok<00:03:57.090> I<00:03:57.300> can<00:03:57.870> hear<00:03:57.960> the<00:03:58.080> hard

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
is coming to life ok I can hear the hard

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.810 
is coming to life ok I can hear the hard
drive<00:03:58.500> so<00:03:58.740> I<00:03:59.070> think<00:03:59.340> the<00:03:59.430> hard<00:03:59.580> drive<00:03:59.790> works

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:01.820 
drive so I think the hard drive works

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:07.550 
drive so I think the hard drive works
but<00:04:02.820> I've<00:04:03.660> seen<00:04:04.080> here<00:04:05.090> eventually<00:04:06.530> there<00:04:07.530> is

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
but I've seen here eventually there is

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.460 
but I've seen here eventually there is
nothing<00:04:08.040> on<00:04:08.220> it<00:04:08.690> and<00:04:09.690> it<00:04:09.810> won't<00:04:09.930> boot<00:04:10.200> into

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
nothing on it and it won't boot into

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.010 
nothing on it and it won't boot into
anything

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.020 
anything

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.130 
anything
there<00:04:13.020> it<00:04:13.140> is<00:04:13.230> there's<00:04:13.590> a<00:04:13.650> little<00:04:13.860> floppy<00:04:14.070> icon

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
there it is there's a little floppy icon

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.200 
there it is there's a little floppy icon
so<00:04:16.140> yeah<00:04:17.010> I'm<00:04:17.280> not<00:04:17.310> gonna<00:04:17.520> boot<00:04:17.790> into<00:04:18.000> anything

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:18.210 
so yeah I'm not gonna boot into anything

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:22.170 
so yeah I'm not gonna boot into anything
this<00:04:19.170> doesn't<00:04:19.500> have<00:04:19.590> anything<00:04:19.799> installed<00:04:20.280> and

this doesn't have anything installed and

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.870 
this doesn't have anything installed and
ya<00:04:22.810> can't<00:04:23.500> really<00:04:23.680> get<00:04:23.830> past<00:04:24.070> much<00:04:24.400> much<00:04:24.639> past

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
ya can't really get past much much past

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.360 
ya can't really get past much much past
this<00:04:25.060> point<00:04:25.330> if<00:04:25.930> I<00:04:26.050> try<00:04:26.290> to<00:04:26.320> take<00:04:26.710> this<00:04:26.889> swab<00:04:27.190> we
