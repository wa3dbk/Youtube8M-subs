what does that say at the bottom let's

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.860 
what does that say at the bottom let's
say<00:03:30.480> your<00:03:31.480> truck<00:03:31.840> is<00:03:32.019> not<00:03:32.200> carrying<00:03:32.620> any<00:03:32.799> loads

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
wait did I go to the second place let's

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.770 
wait did I go to the second place let's
look<00:03:38.530> at<00:03:38.680> the<00:03:38.739> map<00:03:38.769> so<00:03:39.519> here<00:03:39.850> we<00:03:39.970> are<00:03:40.120> objective

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
look at the map so here we are objective

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.599 
look at the map so here we are objective
and<00:03:41.850> on<00:03:42.850> the<00:03:43.480> other<00:03:43.690> side<00:03:44.500> of<00:03:44.530> the<00:03:44.890> map<00:03:45.160> it<00:03:45.370> says

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:45.609 
and on the other side of the map it says

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:48.690 
and on the other side of the map it says
lumber<00:03:46.650> we<00:03:47.650> went<00:03:47.890> to<00:03:47.980> the<00:03:48.070> completely<00:03:48.459> wrong

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
lumber we went to the completely wrong

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
alright we can I'm gonna run down this

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.280 
alright we can I'm gonna run down this
tree<00:03:58.090> these<00:03:59.090> trucks<00:03:59.360> trucks<00:03:59.750> can<00:03:59.930> take<00:04:00.110> down

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
tree these trucks trucks can take down

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.790 
tree these trucks trucks can take down
trees<00:04:00.590> right<00:04:00.830> that<00:04:01.310> is<00:04:01.490> a<00:04:01.520> really<00:04:01.820> strong<00:04:02.210> tree
