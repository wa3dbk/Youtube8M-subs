links wide on it

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.010 
links wide on it
but<00:00:16.590> then<00:00:16.800> it's<00:00:17.430> about<00:00:18.330> another<00:00:18.600> couple

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
but then it's about another couple

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.109 
but then it's about another couple
inches<00:00:19.170> just<00:00:19.670> from<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.910> wheel<00:00:21.240> length<00:00:21.570> but

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:23.119 
inches just from the wheel length but

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:25.550 
inches just from the wheel length but
it's<00:00:24.119> a<00:00:24.420> really<00:00:24.779> good<00:00:24.869> deck<00:00:25.080> I<00:00:25.230> would<00:00:25.380> not

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
it's a really good deck I would not

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.410 
it's a really good deck I would not
recommend<00:00:25.980> it<00:00:26.160> for<00:00:26.250> beginning<00:00:26.609> beginners

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
recommend it for beginning beginners

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.599 
recommend it for beginning beginners
though<00:00:27.630> because<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:28.380> turning<00:00:28.949> on<00:00:29.070> is<00:00:29.189> very

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
though because the turning on is very

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.780 
though because the turning on is very
active<00:00:30.210> in<00:00:30.619> its<00:00:31.619> kind<00:00:31.949> of<00:00:32.009> hard<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.219> use<00:00:32.430> the

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
active in its kind of hard to use the

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.970 
active in its kind of hard to use the
first<00:00:33.059> time<00:00:33.329> actually<00:00:33.750> put<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.380> trucks<00:00:34.649> on<00:00:34.829> it

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
first time actually put the trucks on it

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.110 
first time actually put the trucks on it
put<00:00:35.130> them<00:00:35.219> on<00:00:35.340> backwards<00:00:35.579> by<00:00:36.030> accident<00:00:36.480> and

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
put them on backwards by accident and

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.520 
put them on backwards by accident and

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
if you see the tail I put a piece of

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.270 
if you see the tail I put a piece of
rubber<00:00:56.940> on<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.180> right<00:00:57.360> here<00:00:57.660> because<00:00:58.500> uh<00:00:58.530> if

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
rubber on it right here because uh if

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
you don't have that and it falls into a

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.509 
you don't have that and it falls into a
curb<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:01.680> bangs<00:01:02.129> that<00:01:02.370> up<00:01:02.550> really<00:01:02.850> bad<00:01:03.260> so<00:01:04.519> the

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
curb it bangs that up really bad so the

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.760 
curb it bangs that up really bad so the
decks<00:01:05.880> are<00:01:06.060> really<00:01:06.240> nice<00:01:06.390> -<00:01:06.630> really<00:01:06.869> thick

decks are really nice - really thick
it's<00:01:08.520> nine-ply<00:01:09.920> and<00:01:12.049> the<00:01:13.049> trucks<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:13.530> can<00:01:13.560> see

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
it's nine-ply and the trucks you can see

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.200 
it's nine-ply and the trucks you can see
that<00:01:14.040> has<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:15.229> it<00:01:16.229> just<00:01:16.439> has<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.770> regular

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.280 
tension Springs with that's the black
spring<00:01:20.610> so<00:01:20.850> it's<00:01:20.970> pretty<00:01:21.090> good<00:01:21.210> it's<00:01:21.990> really

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
wheel cutouts right there so wheels

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.080 
wheel cutouts right there so wheels
don't<00:01:29.220> scratch<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:29.820> too<00:01:30.090> much<00:01:30.270> but<00:01:31.939> you<00:01:32.939> also

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
it if you're more of an experienced

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.719 
it if you're more of an experienced
rider<00:01:56.159> so<00:01:56.549> it's<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.479> really<00:01:57.600> good<00:01:58.520> good<00:01:59.520> board

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
rider so it's a really good good board

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.969 
rider so it's a really good good board
to<00:01:59.790> have<00:02:00.229> but<00:02:01.229> not<00:02:02.189> really<00:02:02.610> a<00:02:03.259> it's<00:02:04.259> more<00:02:04.829> of<00:02:04.920> a

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
to have but not really a it's more of a

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.370 
to have but not really a it's more of a
downhill<00:02:05.280> board<00:02:05.820> not<00:02:06.030> a<00:02:06.090> sliding<00:02:06.990> board<00:02:07.170> or

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
downhill board not a sliding board or

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.499 
downhill board not a sliding board or
trick<00:02:07.619> board<00:02:07.890> so<00:02:08.190> it's<00:02:08.459> more<00:02:08.640> like<00:02:08.819> a<00:02:08.849> dancing

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
trick board so it's more like a dancing
