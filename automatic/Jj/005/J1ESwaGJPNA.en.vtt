I'm<00:01:50.990> gonna<00:01:51.229> use<00:01:51.380> Razor<00:01:51.680> Leaf<00:01:51.829> but<00:01:52.430> I<00:01:53.380> don't

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
I'm gonna use Razor Leaf but I don't

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.010

think<00:01:54.680> it<00:01:54.860> would<00:01:54.950> be<00:01:55.009> very<00:01:55.040> good<00:01:55.780> it<00:01:56.780> was<00:01:56.900> not

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
think it would be very good it was not

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.179 
think it would be very good it was not
very<00:01:57.110> effective<00:01:57.350> but<00:01:57.650> it<00:01:57.770> still<00:01:57.920> did<00:01:58.040> pretty

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189 
very effective but it still did pretty

00:01:58.189 --> 00:01:59.920 
very effective but it still did pretty
good<00:01:58.280> month<00:01:58.520> damage<00:01:58.880> so<00:01:59.630> he<00:01:59.780> did<00:01:59.899> a

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
good month damage so he did a

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:05.230 
good month damage so he did a
thundershock<00:02:00.439> and<00:02:01.509> for<00:02:03.729> HP<00:02:04.729> took<00:02:04.880> it<00:02:04.970> out<00:02:05.090> and

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
thundershock and for HP took it out and

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.969 
thundershock and for HP took it out and
it's<00:02:05.450> not<00:02:05.570> very<00:02:05.600> effective<00:02:05.899> so<00:02:06.259> this<00:02:06.470> gym<00:02:06.740> is

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
it's not very effective so this gym is

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.590 
it's not very effective so this gym is
gonna<00:02:07.460> be<00:02:07.549> pretty<00:02:07.670> simple<00:02:08.350> because<00:02:10.510> you<00:02:11.510> know

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600
