you're kind of intermediate java and you
want<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.299> maybe<00:01:16.049> look<00:01:16.350> into<00:01:16.500> some<00:01:17.009> 3d<00:01:17.400> stuff

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
want to maybe look into some 3d stuff

engine<00:01:20.130> com<00:01:21.259> I<00:01:22.259> might<00:01:22.860> even<00:01:22.890> do<00:01:23.220> some

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
engine com I might even do some

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.120 
engine com I might even do some
tutorials<00:01:23.640> on<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.210> but<00:01:24.960> maybe<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:25.860> will<00:01:26.009> be

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
tutorials on it but maybe that will be

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.690 
tutorials on it but maybe that will be
in<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.340> future<00:01:27.229> so<00:01:28.229> when<00:01:28.740> this<00:01:28.950> loads<00:01:29.280> there

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
in the future so when this loads there

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.440 
in the future so when this loads there
we<00:01:29.790> go<00:01:30.409> as<00:01:31.409> you<00:01:31.860> can<00:01:31.979> see<00:01:32.250> I've<00:01:32.430> got<00:01:32.490> this<00:01:33.119> kind

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
we go as you can see I've got this kind

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.100 
we go as you can see I've got this kind
of<00:01:34.400> grass<00:01:35.400> this<00:01:35.970> grass<00:01:36.270> texture<00:01:36.659> is<00:01:36.810> just<00:01:36.990> like

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
of grass this grass texture is just like

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.410 
of grass this grass texture is just like
a<00:01:37.140> sample<00:01:37.560> texture<00:01:37.950> if<00:01:38.460> I<00:01:38.640> kind<00:01:38.880> of<00:01:38.970> fly<00:01:39.270> up

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
a sample texture if I kind of fly up

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.810 
a sample texture if I kind of fly up
with<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.720> camera<00:01:40.079> up<00:01:40.619> here<00:01:41.810> this<00:01:42.810> is<00:01:43.049> like<00:01:43.820> 256

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
with the camera up here this is like 256

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:54.139 
with the camera up here this is like 256
x<00:01:45.060> 256<00:01:45.780> x<00:01:46.490> 1280<00:01:48.530> rather<00:01:51.049> yeah<00:01:52.049> 256<00:01:52.950> 256<00:01:53.280> 128<00:01:54.000> and

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
x 256 x 1280 rather yeah 256 256 128 and

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.690 
x 256 x 1280 rather yeah 256 256 128 and
it's<00:01:54.720> like<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:55.500> chunk<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:56.040> a<00:01:56.130> world<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:56.549> it's

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
it's like a chunk of a world and it's

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.050 
it's like a chunk of a world and it's
just<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:56.969> solid<00:01:57.299> trunk<00:01:57.570> made<00:01:58.259> up<00:01:58.439> of<00:01:58.649> around<00:01:59.060> 8.5

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
just a solid trunk made up of around 8.5

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.929 
just a solid trunk made up of around 8.5
million<00:02:00.450> blocks<00:02:00.840> I<00:02:01.020> think<00:02:01.259> and<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.640> way<00:02:02.670> it's

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
million blocks I think and the way it's

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.120 
million blocks I think and the way it's
created<00:02:03.420> means<00:02:03.659> it<00:02:03.899> emits<00:02:04.259> blocks<00:02:04.590> that<00:02:04.860> can't

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
created means it emits blocks that can't

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.969 
created means it emits blocks that can't
be<00:02:05.310> seen<00:02:05.520> so<00:02:06.350> it<00:02:07.819> significantly<00:02:09.050> I<00:02:10.050> mean<00:02:10.739> it

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
be seen so it significantly I mean it

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.920 
be seen so it significantly I mean it
makes<00:02:11.220> it<00:02:11.430> playable<00:02:11.700> basically<00:02:12.270> like<00:02:12.599> if<00:02:12.750> each

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
makes it playable basically like if each

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.730 
makes it playable basically like if each
one<00:02:13.140> of<00:02:13.170> these

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
one of these

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.860 
one of these
box<00:02:13.910> including<00:02:14.910> the<00:02:15.030> inside<00:02:15.360> ones<00:02:15.600> with

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
box including the inside ones with

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.140 
box including the inside ones with
individual<00:02:16.380> things<00:02:16.590> then<00:02:16.890> it<00:02:17.490> could<00:02:17.700> never

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
individual things then it could never

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.390 
individual things then it could never
run<00:02:18.360> as<00:02:18.540> fast<00:02:18.720> as<00:02:18.960> it<00:02:19.110> would<00:02:19.260> but<00:02:20.010> as<00:02:20.130> you<00:02:20.280> can

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
run as fast as it would but as you can

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.550 
run as fast as it would but as you can
see<00:02:20.640> kind<00:02:20.880> of<00:02:21.030> 80<00:02:21.240> 90<00:02:21.630> frames<00:02:21.750> per<00:02:21.990> second<00:02:22.350> and

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
see kind of 80 90 frames per second and

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.470 
see kind of 80 90 frames per second and
that's<00:02:22.770> only<00:02:22.920> because<00:02:23.100> i'm<00:02:23.370> using<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:24.240> screen

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
that's only because i'm using the screen

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.510 
that's only because i'm using the screen
recorder<00:02:24.900> at<00:02:24.960> the<00:02:25.050> same<00:02:25.200> time<00:02:25.440> when<00:02:26.190> I<00:02:26.220> don't

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
recorder at the same time when I don't

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.570 
recorder at the same time when I don't
use<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:26.790> screen<00:02:27.030> recorder<00:02:27.420> I<00:02:27.540> get<00:02:27.780> kind<00:02:27.990> of

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
use the screen recorder I get kind of

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.500 
use the screen recorder I get kind of
150<00:02:29.580> FPS<00:02:30.620> but<00:02:31.620> that's<00:02:31.890> it<00:02:32.640> for<00:02:32.880> the<00:02:32.970> moment<00:02:33.270> I

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
150 FPS but that's it for the moment I

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.300 
150 FPS but that's it for the moment I
just<00:02:33.540> wanted<00:02:33.900> to<00:02:33.930> make<00:02:34.290> this<00:02:34.530> to<00:02:34.890> start<00:02:35.160> the

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
just wanted to make this to start the

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.460 
just wanted to make this to start the
development<00:02:35.760> Diaries<00:02:36.030> off<00:02:36.180> because<00:02:36.510> kind<00:02:37.350> of

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
development Diaries off because kind of

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.710 
development Diaries off because kind of
hit<00:02:37.680> a<00:02:37.710> small<00:02:37.920> milestone<00:02:38.580> in<00:02:38.880> generating

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
hit a small milestone in generating

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.650 
hit a small milestone in generating
chunks<00:02:40.140> of<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:40.350> world<00:02:40.530> so<00:02:41.450> hopefully<00:02:42.450> next

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
chunks of the world so hopefully next

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.410 
chunks of the world so hopefully next
time<00:02:42.780> I<00:02:43.140> can<00:02:43.530> I<00:02:43.770> will<00:02:44.040> have<00:02:44.250> more<00:02:45.060> than<00:02:45.180> one

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
time I can I will have more than one

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.550 
time I can I will have more than one
chunk<00:02:45.750> of<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:46.020> world<00:02:46.200> that<00:02:46.380> can<00:02:47.070> generate

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
chunk of the world that can generate

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.530 
chunk of the world that can generate
progressively<00:02:49.560> and<00:02:49.830> maybe<00:02:50.700> even<00:02:50.880> some<00:02:51.180> random

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
progressively and maybe even some random

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.260 
progressively and maybe even some random
generation<00:02:52.160> so<00:02:53.160> it's<00:02:53.310> not<00:02:53.490> just<00:02:53.550> one<00:02:53.970> enormous

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
generation so it's not just one enormous

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.000 
generation so it's not just one enormous
block<00:02:54.660> it's<00:02:54.990> kind<00:02:55.260> of<00:02:56.870> sort<00:02:57.870> of<00:02:58.020> random<00:02:58.740> cells

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
block it's kind of sort of random cells

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.370 
block it's kind of sort of random cells
everywhere<00:02:59.460> so<00:03:00.030> I<00:03:00.390> hope<00:03:00.780> you<00:03:00.960> enjoyed<00:03:01.230> this

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
everywhere so I hope you enjoyed this

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.630 
everywhere so I hope you enjoyed this

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
you think again this isn't going to be a

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.830 
you think again this isn't going to be a
copy<00:03:05.400> of<00:03:05.520> Minecraft<00:03:06.060> I<00:03:06.210> plan<00:03:06.420> for<00:03:06.450> it<00:03:06.660> to<00:03:06.750> be

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
copy of Minecraft I plan for it to be

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.220 
copy of Minecraft I plan for it to be
much<00:03:07.080> different<00:03:07.560> so<00:03:08.390> come<00:03:09.390> post<00:03:09.780> and<00:03:09.930> comment
