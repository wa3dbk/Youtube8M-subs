00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
hi this is yolanda vanveen and in this

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:04.430 
hi this is yolanda vanveen and in this
segment<00:00:02.939> we're<00:00:03.240> gonna<00:00:03.330> talk<00:00:03.540> about<00:00:03.570> how<00:00:04.380> to

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
segment we're gonna talk about how to

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.820 
segment we're gonna talk about how to
care<00:00:04.799> for<00:00:04.859> a<00:00:05.190> topiary<00:00:05.850> or<00:00:06.240> how<00:00:06.420> to<00:00:06.480> care<00:00:06.779> for

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:06.830 
care for a topiary or how to care for

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.370 
care for a topiary or how to care for
topiaries<00:00:07.830> now<00:00:08.700> a<00:00:08.730> topiary<00:00:09.389> is<00:00:09.809> pretty<00:00:10.170> much

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
topiaries now a topiary is pretty much

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.730 
topiaries now a topiary is pretty much
any<00:00:10.679> type<00:00:11.099> of<00:00:11.130> plant<00:00:11.610> that<00:00:11.940> has<00:00:12.389> grown<00:00:12.719> to<00:00:13.349> be<00:00:13.559> a

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
any type of plant that has grown to be a

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.400 
any type of plant that has grown to be a
nice<00:00:14.040> visual<00:00:14.610> design<00:00:15.120> that's<00:00:15.870> going<00:00:16.139> to<00:00:16.260> be

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
nice visual design that's going to be

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.500 
nice visual design that's going to be
unnatural<00:00:16.740> than<00:00:17.010> its<00:00:17.279> natural<00:00:17.789> growth<00:00:18.029> habit

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
unnatural than its natural growth habit

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.230 
unnatural than its natural growth habit
so<00:00:19.140> a<00:00:19.470> topiary<00:00:19.920> can<00:00:20.460> be<00:00:20.580> pretty<00:00:20.789> much<00:00:20.939> any

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
so a topiary can be pretty much any

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.689 
so a topiary can be pretty much any
plant<00:00:21.630> that<00:00:21.750> has<00:00:21.960> grown<00:00:22.230> into<00:00:22.650> another<00:00:23.310> shape

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
plant that has grown into another shape

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.900 
plant that has grown into another shape
to<00:00:24.180> look<00:00:24.330> like<00:00:24.539> an<00:00:24.689> animal<00:00:25.230> or<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:25.800> flower<00:00:26.250> or

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
to look like an animal or a flower or

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.870 
to look like an animal or a flower or
even<00:00:27.449> a<00:00:27.570> heart<00:00:27.980> topiary<00:00:28.980> started<00:00:29.460> back<00:00:29.609> in<00:00:29.789> the

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
even a heart topiary started back in the

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.150 
even a heart topiary started back in the
Roman<00:00:30.269> days<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:30.929> it's<00:00:31.349> much<00:00:31.619> related<00:00:32.009> to

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
Roman days and it's much related to

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.130 
Roman days and it's much related to
bonsai<00:00:32.820> that<00:00:33.149> was<00:00:33.270> started<00:00:33.600> in<00:00:33.719> China<00:00:33.930> in

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
bonsai that was started in China in

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.040 
bonsai that was started in China in
Japan<00:00:34.559> but<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.160> topiary<00:00:35.670> was<00:00:36.059> more<00:00:36.390> like<00:00:37.020> a

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
Japan but a topiary was more like a

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.830 
Japan but a topiary was more like a
large<00:00:37.380> boxwood<00:00:38.309> that<00:00:38.550> was<00:00:38.670> in<00:00:38.790> a<00:00:38.879> nice<00:00:39.180> garden

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
large boxwood that was in a nice garden

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.930 
large boxwood that was in a nice garden
that<00:00:40.290> they<00:00:40.469> would<00:00:40.680> trim<00:00:40.980> into<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.309> shape<00:00:41.670> of<00:00:41.790> a

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
that they would trim into the shape of a

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.270 
that they would trim into the shape of a
horse<00:00:42.239> or<00:00:42.540> trim<00:00:42.750> it<00:00:42.870> into<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.200> shape<00:00:43.469> of<00:00:43.649> an

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
horse or trim it into the shape of an

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.970 
horse or trim it into the shape of an
eagle<00:00:44.700> or<00:00:44.969> anything<00:00:45.480> really<00:00:45.780> interesting<00:00:46.200> and

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
eagle or anything really interesting and

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.549 
eagle or anything really interesting and
so<00:00:47.550> over<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:47.940> years<00:00:48.090> in<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.660> centuries<00:00:49.260> we've

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
so over the years in the centuries we've

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.889 
so over the years in the centuries we've
continued<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.789> take<00:00:50.969> topiaries<00:00:51.600> into

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
continued to take topiaries into

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.720 
continued to take topiaries into
different<00:00:52.230> shapes<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.739> right<00:00:53.280> now<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.489> big

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
different shapes and right now a big

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.900 
different shapes and right now a big
trend<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.149> just<00:00:54.360> taking<00:00:54.690> ivy<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.760> training<00:00:56.760> it

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
trend is just taking ivy and training it

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.760 
trend is just taking ivy and training it
to<00:00:57.090> look<00:00:57.300> like<00:00:57.480> another<00:00:57.780> shape<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.410> right

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
to look like another shape and right

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.619 
to look like another shape and right
here<00:00:58.980> I'm<00:00:59.070> trying<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.460> make<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.670> big<00:00:59.910> heart<00:01:00.359> out

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
here I'm trying to make a big heart out

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.920 
here I'm trying to make a big heart out
of<00:01:00.690> this<00:01:01.079> ivy<00:01:01.649> Ivy<00:01:02.129> topiary<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.180> so<00:01:03.690> as<00:01:03.899> long

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
of this ivy Ivy topiary and so as long

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.260 
of this ivy Ivy topiary and so as long
as<00:01:04.320> it<00:01:04.559> keeps<00:01:04.680> growing<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.460> gets<00:01:06.000> more

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
as it keeps growing and gets more

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.870 
as it keeps growing and gets more
medusa-like<00:01:06.780> stems<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.619> just<00:01:07.860> put<00:01:08.520> it<00:01:08.670> back

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
medusa-like stems I just put it back

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.170 
medusa-like stems I just put it back
into<00:01:09.350> the<00:01:10.350> container<00:01:11.070> so<00:01:11.520> that<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:11.760> stays<00:01:11.939> more

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
into the container so that it stays more

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.450 
into the container so that it stays more
compact<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.080> eventually<00:01:13.799> I<00:01:13.830> want<00:01:14.040> this<00:01:14.250> to

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
compact and eventually I want this to

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.850 
compact and eventually I want this to
just<00:01:14.490> be<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.850> big<00:01:15.240> bubble<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.470> be<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.619> nice

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
just be a big bubble and to be a nice

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.700 
just be a big bubble and to be a nice
heart<00:01:17.220> that's<00:01:17.460> just<00:01:17.759> all<00:01:17.970> Ivy<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.720> so<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.470> take

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
heart that's just all Ivy and so to take

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.440 
heart that's just all Ivy and so to take
care<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.040> it<00:01:20.280> you've<00:01:20.490> got<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.820> make<00:01:20.970> sure<00:01:21.180> and

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
care of it you've got to make sure and

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.420 
care of it you've got to make sure and
keep<00:01:21.600> it<00:01:21.780> moist<00:01:21.960> just<00:01:22.439> like<00:01:22.590> any<00:01:22.830> other<00:01:23.009> plant

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
keep it moist just like any other plant

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.249 
keep it moist just like any other plant
but<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.150> don't<00:01:24.330> want<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:24.570> sitting<00:01:24.780> in<00:01:24.990> water

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
but you don't want it sitting in water

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.200 
but you don't want it sitting in water
because<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:25.650> will<00:01:25.830> rot<00:01:26.040> as<00:01:26.250> well<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:27.000> many

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
because it will rot as well and many

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.969 
because it will rot as well and many
times<00:01:27.479> topiaries<00:01:27.990> are<00:01:28.110> made<00:01:28.259> right<00:01:28.470> into<00:01:28.740> moss

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
times topiaries are made right into moss

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.520 
times topiaries are made right into moss
and<00:01:29.549> so<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:29.909> want<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.119> keep<00:01:30.270> that<00:01:30.450> moss<00:01:30.810> really

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
and so you want to keep that moss really

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.399 
and so you want to keep that moss really
wet<00:01:31.770> but<00:01:31.799> never<00:01:32.340> too<00:01:32.759> dry<00:01:33.090> either<00:01:33.390> or<00:01:33.900> too<00:01:34.200> wet

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
wet but never too dry either or too wet

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.370 
wet but never too dry either or too wet
and<00:01:34.829> they<00:01:35.490> want<00:01:35.729> full<00:01:36.030> Sun<00:01:36.420> most<00:01:36.780> topiaries

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
and they want full Sun most topiaries

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.469 
and they want full Sun most topiaries
are<00:01:37.619> made<00:01:37.770> out<00:01:37.920> of<00:01:37.950> box<00:01:38.250> woods<00:01:38.579> or<00:01:38.759> Ivy's<00:01:39.270> or

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
are made out of box woods or Ivy's or

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:40.249 
are made out of box woods or Ivy's or
even<00:01:39.810> Holly

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
even Holly

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.580 
even Holly
and<00:01:40.439> they<00:01:40.979> all<00:01:41.250> need<00:01:41.549> full<00:01:41.880> hot<00:01:42.210> Sun<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.930> they

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
and they all need full hot Sun and they

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.469 
and they all need full hot Sun and they
will<00:01:44.130> do<00:01:44.310> really<00:01:44.610> well<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.180> then<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.450> best

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
will do really well and then the best

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.620
