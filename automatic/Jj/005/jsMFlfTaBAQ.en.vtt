00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.170 
dive into this song there's two ways to
play<00:01:32.659> it<00:01:33.130> the<00:01:34.130> way<00:01:34.159> that<00:01:34.430> Keith<00:01:34.640> plays<00:01:34.940> it

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180

play it the way that Keith plays it
which<00:01:35.450> is<00:01:35.630> not<00:01:35.840> difficult<00:01:36.049> but<00:01:36.710> it<00:01:36.770> does

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
which is not difficult but it does

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.060 
which is not difficult but it does
require<00:01:37.250> capo<00:01:37.969> and<00:01:38.649> you<00:01:39.649> gotta<00:01:39.860> be

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
require capo and you gotta be

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.380 
require capo and you gotta be
comfortable<00:01:40.549> with<00:01:40.880> stretching<00:01:41.119> your<00:01:41.270> fingers

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
a little bit and then there's a slightly

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:45.520 
a little bit and then there's a slightly
easier<00:01:43.340> way<00:01:43.880> without<00:01:44.240> a<00:01:44.270> capo<00:01:44.689> I'm<00:01:45.110> gonna<00:01:45.320> run

that sounds like full speed is kind of
like<00:03:13.709> so<00:03:17.730> something<00:03:18.730> like<00:03:18.760> that<00:03:19.439> really<00:03:20.439> the

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
like so something like that really the

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.110 
like so something like that really the
main<00:03:20.769> thing<00:03:20.950> is<00:03:21.069> that<00:03:21.099> you<00:03:21.819> know<00:03:21.909> it<00:03:21.999> doesn't

main thing is that you know it doesn't

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.459 
main thing is that you know it doesn't
matter<00:03:22.299> too<00:03:22.480> much<00:03:22.540> what<00:03:22.900> you're<00:03:23.079> doing<00:03:23.319> with

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:23.469 
matter too much what you're doing with

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:24.929 
matter too much what you're doing with
that<00:03:23.500> chucking<00:03:24.069> you<00:03:24.340> want<00:03:24.519> to<00:03:24.579> go<00:03:24.670> ahead<00:03:24.760> and

00:03:24.929 --> 00:03:24.939 
that chucking you want to go ahead and

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:34.410 
alright so all together the way Keith

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:48.950 
alright so all together the way Keith

like<00:05:49.110> that<00:05:49.290> and<00:05:49.530> that<00:05:49.560> is<00:05:49.680> pretty<00:05:50.070> much<00:05:50.250> the

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 
like that and that is pretty much the

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.470 
like that and that is pretty much the
whole<00:05:50.520> song<00:05:50.730> I<00:05:50.880> think<00:05:50.940> the<00:05:51.120> bridge<00:05:51.270> is<00:05:51.420> a

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:51.480 
whole song I think the bridge is a

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:52.790 
whole song I think the bridge is a
little<00:05:51.660> bit<00:05:51.780> different<00:05:52.200> I<00:05:52.290> want<00:05:52.440> to<00:05:52.500> say<00:05:52.620> it's

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800 
little bit different I want to say it's

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.230 
little bit different I want to say it's
like<00:05:52.890> D<00:05:53.520> F<00:05:54.510> sharp<00:05:54.960> D<00:05:55.740> day<00:05:56.370> or<00:05:56.820> something<00:05:57.030> along

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:57.240 
like D F sharp D day or something along

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.910 
like D F sharp D day or something along
