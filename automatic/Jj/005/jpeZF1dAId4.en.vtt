good<00:01:07.920> so<00:01:08.159> far<00:01:08.430> just<00:01:08.760> gonna<00:01:08.970> let<00:01:09.119> it<00:01:09.150> load<00:01:09.360> up<00:01:09.600> I

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
good so far just gonna let it load up I

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.820

have<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:11.820> look<00:01:11.970> at<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.150> graphics<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:13.290> then<00:01:13.590> I

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
have a look at the graphics and then I

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:27.380 
have a look at the graphics and then I
don't<00:01:16.830> go

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.649 

a<00:01:27.479> bit<00:01:28.050> difficult<00:01:28.560> rotating<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.400> screen

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
a bit difficult rotating the screen

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.200 
a bit difficult rotating the screen
easier<00:01:30.659> if<00:01:30.720> you<00:01:30.810> using<00:01:31.020> two<00:01:31.320> hands<00:01:31.500> you<00:01:32.180> know<00:01:33.180> I

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
easier if you using two hands you know I

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.109 
easier if you using two hands you know I
use<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.080> door<00:01:34.260> anything<00:01:34.620> like<00:01:34.860> that<00:01:34.890> just<00:01:35.850> run

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
use the door anything like that just run

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.680 
use the door anything like that just run
into<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:36.540> or<00:01:36.750> if<00:01:37.140> you're<00:01:37.260> approaching<00:01:37.470> tap

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
into it or if you're approaching tap

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:45.920 
into it or if you're approaching tap
just<00:01:39.690> like<00:01:39.810> that<00:01:44.090> loading<00:01:45.090> times<00:01:45.330> aren't<00:01:45.750> too

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
just like that loading times aren't too

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.620 
just like that loading times aren't too
bad<00:01:46.970> but<00:01:47.970> all<00:01:48.119> in<00:01:48.300> all<00:01:48.950> it's<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:50.390> great<00:01:51.390> little

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
bad but all in all it's a great little

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.770 
bad but all in all it's a great little
port<00:01:51.960> I'm<00:01:52.560> running<00:01:52.890> it<00:01:52.979> on<00:01:53.130> my<00:01:54.710> Galaxy<00:01:55.710> Tab<00:01:55.890> 3

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
probably run a bit better on ways for it

my fingers not annoy on my Galaxy Tab
say<00:02:13.860> you're<00:02:14.070> probably<00:02:14.220> looking<00:02:14.400> at<00:02:14.850> a<00:02:18.350> galaxy

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700

s3 s4 anything with them sort of specs

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:26.570 
s3 s4 anything with them sort of specs
probably<00:02:23.190> running<00:02:23.459> a<00:02:23.489> bit<00:02:23.640> better<00:02:25.280> as<00:02:26.280> opposed

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
probably running a bit better as opposed

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.670 
probably running a bit better as opposed
to<00:02:26.640> protestors<00:02:27.330> running<00:02:27.959> on<00:02:28.110> a<00:02:28.170> bigger<00:02:28.380> screen

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
to protestors running on a bigger screen

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.009 
to protestors running on a bigger screen
so<00:02:29.100> he's<00:02:29.910> having<00:02:30.150> a<00:02:30.239> bit<00:02:30.390> of<00:02:30.420> a<00:02:30.540> tougher<00:02:30.840> time

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
so he's having a bit of a tougher time

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:37.670 
so he's having a bit of a tougher time
but<00:02:32.390> I'm<00:02:33.390> just<00:02:33.660> happy<00:02:33.840> to<00:02:34.019> a<00:02:36.170> sea<00:02:37.170> dragon<00:02:37.320> quest
