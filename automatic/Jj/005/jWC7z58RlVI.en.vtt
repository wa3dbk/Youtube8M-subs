really cool too so we're gonna check

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.250 
really cool too so we're gonna check
this<00:00:18.060> out<00:00:18.240> first<00:00:18.720> thing<00:00:18.810> we<00:00:18.960> should<00:00:18.990> do<00:00:19.230> is

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
this out first thing we should do is

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.630 
this out first thing we should do is
show<00:00:19.529> you<00:00:19.560> guys<00:00:19.740> how<00:00:19.830> to<00:00:19.859> make<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.130> portal<00:00:20.490> and

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
show you guys how to make the portal and

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.890 
show you guys how to make the portal and
it's<00:00:20.789> just<00:00:20.939> made<00:00:21.060> out<00:00:21.180> of<00:00:21.300> mossy<00:00:21.570> cobblestone

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
it's just made out of mossy cobblestone

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.050 
it's just made out of mossy cobblestone
so<00:00:22.109> it's<00:00:22.230> really<00:00:22.380> easy<00:00:22.470> to<00:00:22.740> make<00:00:22.859> and<00:00:23.640> all<00:00:23.970> you

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
so it's really easy to make and all you

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.460 
so it's really easy to make and all you
need<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:24.240> do<00:00:24.359> is<00:00:24.480> light<00:00:24.630> it<00:00:24.660> with<00:00:24.869> flight<00:00:25.350> and

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
need to do is light it with flight and

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.870 
need to do is light it with flight and
steel<00:00:25.619> just<00:00:25.740> like<00:00:25.890> a<00:00:25.920> nether<00:00:26.130> portal<00:00:26.460> it

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
steel just like a nether portal it

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.550 
steel just like a nether portal it
probably<00:00:27.390> needs<00:00:27.570> some<00:00:27.630> retexture<00:00:28.260> ring<00:00:28.380> I

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
probably needs some retexture ring I

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.470 
probably needs some retexture ring I
would<00:00:29.099> think<00:00:29.340> I<00:00:29.550> don't<00:00:29.789> know<00:00:30.000> it<00:00:30.090> doesn't<00:00:30.179> I

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
would think I don't know it doesn't I

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.060 
would think I don't know it doesn't I
think<00:00:30.720> it<00:00:30.810> needs<00:00:30.929> some<00:00:31.019> work<00:00:31.050> my<00:00:31.349> opinion<00:00:31.710> but

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
think it needs some work my opinion but

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.010 
think it needs some work my opinion but
we<00:00:32.219> will<00:00:32.430> head<00:00:32.610> into<00:00:32.759> here<00:00:33.059> and<00:00:33.809> this

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
we will head into here and this

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.799 
we will head into here and this
dimension<00:00:34.320> basically<00:00:35.130> what<00:00:35.610> it<00:00:35.700> is<00:00:35.820> is<00:00:36.059> it's

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
dimension basically what it is is it's

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.530 
dimension basically what it is is it's
like<00:00:36.930> a<00:00:36.960> jungle<00:00:37.320> with<00:00:37.800> mushrooms<00:00:38.399> I<00:00:38.670> think<00:00:39.480> it

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
like a jungle with mushrooms I think it

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.850 
like a jungle with mushrooms I think it
looks<00:00:39.690> really<00:00:39.809> nice<00:00:40.050> though<00:00:40.290> just<00:00:40.710> get<00:00:40.829> a

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
looks really nice though just get a

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.040 
looks really nice though just get a
pretty<00:00:41.309> good<00:00:41.460> look<00:00:41.610> at<00:00:41.760> it<00:00:41.910> so<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:42.809> have<00:00:42.960> to

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
pretty good look at it so you have to

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.930 
pretty good look at it so you have to
jungle<00:00:43.410> with<00:00:43.530> mushrooms<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.219> you<00:00:44.700> don't

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
jungle with mushrooms and you don't

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.340 
jungle with mushrooms and you don't
really<00:00:45.059> see<00:00:45.149> mushrooms<00:00:45.510> much<00:00:45.840> in<00:00:45.989> Minecraft

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
really see mushrooms much in Minecraft

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.810 
really see mushrooms much in Minecraft
so<00:00:46.469> it's<00:00:46.620> good<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:46.890> see<00:00:47.039> them<00:00:47.160> like<00:00:47.340> mixed<00:00:47.700> in

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
so it's good to see them like mixed in

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.430 
so it's good to see them like mixed in
with<00:00:48.000> all<00:00:48.180> this<00:00:48.300> forests<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:48.930> stuff<00:00:49.110> I<00:00:49.289> don't

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
with all this forests and stuff I don't

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.660 
with all this forests and stuff I don't
know<00:00:49.500> I<00:00:49.530> think<00:00:49.770> it<00:00:49.829> looks<00:00:49.980> pretty<00:00:50.100> cool<00:00:50.460> and

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
can do with it is what I meant if you

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.559 
can do with it is what I meant if you
hold<00:02:45.190> it<00:02:45.250> back<00:02:45.400> like<00:02:45.640> this<00:02:45.790> this<00:02:46.120> is<00:02:46.269> weird<00:02:46.450> I

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
hold it back like this this is weird I

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:48.180 
hold it back like this this is weird I
don't<00:02:46.630> even<00:02:46.780> understand<00:02:47.230> how<00:02:47.290> this<00:02:47.440> works<00:02:47.620> but

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
don't even understand how this works but

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.710 
don't even understand how this works but
then<00:02:48.340> let<00:02:48.489> go<00:02:48.670> and<00:02:48.910> all<00:02:49.299> of<00:02:49.390> a<00:02:49.420> sudden<00:02:49.630> you

then let go and all of a sudden you

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:50.940 
then let go and all of a sudden you
could<00:02:49.780> run<00:02:49.959> like<00:02:50.080> a<00:02:50.140> thousand<00:02:50.560> miles<00:02:50.709> an<00:02:50.830> hour

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
works a little different than it does in

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.140 
works a little different than it does in
most<00:03:20.290> mods<00:03:20.590> I<00:03:20.920> think<00:03:21.489> he's<00:03:21.579> stuffed<00:03:21.910> to<00:03:22.060> be

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
most mods I think he's stuffed to be

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.170 
most mods I think he's stuffed to be
honest<00:03:22.480> and<00:03:22.600> now<00:03:22.690> he's<00:03:22.870> on<00:03:23.019> fire<00:03:23.380> but<00:03:24.280> um<00:03:24.459> you

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
honest and now he's on fire but um you

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.789 
honest and now he's on fire but um you
don't<00:03:25.209> just<00:03:25.510> click<00:03:25.690> it<00:03:25.840> you<00:03:25.900> don't<00:03:26.049> left-click

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
don't just click it you don't left-click

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:27.990 
don't just click it you don't left-click
it<00:03:26.890> or<00:03:27.010> right<00:03:27.190> plate<00:03:27.370> what<00:03:27.519> you<00:03:27.609> do<00:03:27.760> is<00:03:27.910> you

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
it or right plate what you do is you

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.250 
it or right plate what you do is you
actually<00:03:28.269> hold<00:03:28.480> it<00:03:28.600> down<00:03:28.750> like<00:03:28.810> you<00:03:29.079> would<00:03:29.200> a

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
actually hold it down like you would a

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.960 
actually hold it down like you would a
bow<00:03:29.560> as<00:03:30.130> you<00:03:30.250> can<00:03:30.340> see<00:03:30.459> it's<00:03:30.579> going<00:03:30.700> back<00:03:30.940> a

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
bow as you can see it's going back a

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.460 
bow as you can see it's going back a
little<00:03:31.120> bit<00:03:31.269> and<00:03:31.450> then<00:03:31.569> let<00:03:31.600> go<00:03:31.780> and<00:03:32.109> then<00:03:32.380> it

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
little bit and then let go and then it

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.410 
little bit and then let go and then it
shoots<00:03:32.590> the<00:03:32.829> fireball<00:03:33.220> at<00:03:33.370> it<00:03:33.519> so<00:03:34.359> that's

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
shoots the fireball at it so that's

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.759 
shoots the fireball at it so that's
basically<00:03:34.810> how<00:03:34.989> it<00:03:35.079> works<00:03:35.140> so<00:03:35.380> it's<00:03:35.500> a<00:03:35.560> little

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
basically how it works so it's a little

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:37.170 
basically how it works so it's a little
different<00:03:36.069> it's<00:03:36.190> kind<00:03:36.310> of<00:03:36.400> like<00:03:36.519> a<00:03:36.549> bow<00:03:36.850> the

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
different it's kind of like a bow the

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.759 
different it's kind of like a bow the
usage<00:03:37.540> of<00:03:37.690> it<00:03:37.840> but<00:03:37.989> obviously<00:03:38.319> it's<00:03:38.500> a<00:03:38.530> staff

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
usage of it but obviously it's a staff

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.160 
usage of it but obviously it's a staff
