00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
same time looking at it from a maybe

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.779 
same time looking at it from a maybe
from<00:04:35.960> an<00:04:36.139> armchair<00:04:36.560> one<00:04:36.979> of<00:04:37.130> you<00:04:37.280> lose<00:04:37.550> your

00:04:42.989 --> 00:04:42.999 

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:46.859 

I<00:04:44.519> feel<00:04:45.519> very<00:04:45.610> difficult<00:04:46.089> to<00:04:46.179> say<00:04:46.329> because<00:04:46.569> I'm

00:04:46.859 --> 00:04:46.869 
I feel very difficult to say because I'm

00:04:46.869 --> 00:04:48.419 
I feel very difficult to say because I'm
gonna<00:04:47.019> be<00:04:47.139> talking<00:04:47.469> about<00:04:47.499> the<00:04:47.739> first<00:04:48.069> corner

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:48.429 
gonna be talking about the first corner

00:04:48.429 --> 00:04:53.189 
gonna be talking about the first corner
was<00:04:48.549> going<00:04:48.729> to<00:04:48.789> be<00:04:48.879> very<00:04:49.029> tricky<00:04:51.809> be<00:04:52.809> talking

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:53.199 
was going to be very tricky be talking

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:55.319 
was going to be very tricky be talking
about<00:04:53.439> the<00:04:53.589> liability<00:04:53.769> of<00:04:54.219> the<00:04:54.339> cars<00:04:54.669> tactics

00:04:55.319 --> 00:04:55.329 
about the liability of the cars tactics

00:04:55.329 --> 00:04:57.419 
about the liability of the cars tactics
in<00:04:55.449> the<00:04:55.539> race<00:04:55.769> so<00:04:56.769> it<00:04:56.829> was<00:04:57.009> very<00:04:57.279> very

00:04:57.419 --> 00:04:57.429 
in the race so it was very very

00:04:57.429 --> 00:05:00.269 
in the race so it was very very
difficult<00:04:58.029> to<00:04:58.389> say<00:04:58.719> who<00:04:59.019> is<00:04:59.229> always<00:04:59.649> the

00:05:00.269 --> 00:05:00.279 
difficult to say who is always the

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:02.669 
difficult to say who is always the
driver<00:05:00.489> who<00:05:01.479> could<00:05:01.659> win<00:05:01.809> about<00:05:02.049> championship

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:02.679 
driver who could win about championship

00:05:02.679 --> 00:05:05.100
