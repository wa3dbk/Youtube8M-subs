 I have one will start 16 vanilla pink 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:16.340
 since my skin is torn apart by your tone 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.860
 I try to select shades that are not 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.049
 look on her 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.870
 Contrast yellow know as if I 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:26.690
 broke the egg of such a rouge nickname and 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.239
 put the yolk and sit myself matter where 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.400
 nutritional mask they themselves 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:33.859
 ennobling decorative face 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.100
 Cosmetics I put on this side 

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:39.680
 faces using a beautyblender consistency 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.640
 the foundation is average i mean it doesn't 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.040
 thick and not taken 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.750
 c like some muse same time she is not 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.480
 too liquid so if you 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.940
 turn over your hand she doesn't start here 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.550
 so handed over there dig a mark blender 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.350
 I pre-wetted and will 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:03:00.300
 whip up 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:03.240
 the skin so as not to smear him and 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:06.320
 maximally u raise especially needed 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:09.000
 plots well i think it's noticeable that 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.100
 slowly begins to align color 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.830
 faces 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:17.010
 same time if compared with neck up 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.630
 it is clear that there is no terrible difference though 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.420
 put it only here 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:24.090
 but the color is perfect for me a little bit 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:27.390
 start to go around the neck and that's not 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.580
 distinguish places where I have no cream from 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.709
 these are the places where the foundation is already 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.650
 applied on the coating immediately say that 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:36.720
 well masked redness that is 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.810
 here on this half of the face you can see that 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.940
 I have spider veins I give such 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.640
 red specks right here they 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.400
 completely hidden while this cream has 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.220
 very very light texture also y 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:54.090
 I was flaking quite noticeable 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:56.480
 and does not emphasize them at all that is 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.760
 its account is a bit thin 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.620
 consistency he charges well they 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:05.340
 as it matures up 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:08.600
 let's try brushing on 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.600
 the other half of the face 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:17.410
 if compares you to the method of application 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:21.040
 I liked the re-read of the blind more 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:23.800
 because brushes but if the foundation is not 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.320
 too thick one can a little 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.860
 to strip also here i have parables i 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:33.430
 still a little applied foundation 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:35.980
 spadgy tip to and so here instead 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:39.220
 concealer how fix 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:41.680
 beauty blender easier to apply tonal 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:44.820
 cream dotted on some pimples plus 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:49.030
 easier on the words cream because you 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:51.760
 tramples it down to the skin and can be followed 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.590
 trample 2 words while brush it 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.780
 still here distributes when 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:58.060
 superficial in it all you wanted 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:01.090
 show very much hope that this competition 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:06.180
