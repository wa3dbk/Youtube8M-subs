00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
at this point because of the entire

at this point because of the entire

the<00:00:25.019> medium<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:25.590> it's<00:00:25.740> coming<00:00:26.010> back<00:00:26.130> together

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
the medium and it's coming back together

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.790 
the medium and it's coming back together
then<00:00:27.119> I<00:00:27.359> imagine<00:00:27.810> what<00:00:28.140> it's<00:00:28.260> going<00:00:28.320> to<00:00:28.529> take

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
then I imagine what it's going to take

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.710 
then I imagine what it's going to take
is<00:00:28.949> going<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.250> be<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.519> route<00:00:29.730> I<00:00:29.939> believe<00:00:30.449> that

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
is going to be the route I believe that

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.089 
is going to be the route I believe that
the<00:00:31.019> way<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.410> medium<00:00:31.710> is<00:00:31.800> going<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:32.040> be

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
the way the medium is going to be

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.920 
the way the medium is going to be
defeated<00:00:32.369> is<00:00:32.700> definitely<00:00:33.420> going<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:33.630> be<00:00:33.690> due

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
defeated is definitely going to be due

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.410 
defeated is definitely going to be due
to<00:00:33.960> Aladdin<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:35.010> Titus<00:00:35.670> because<00:00:36.000> we<00:00:36.090> find<00:00:36.300> out

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
to Aladdin and Titus because we find out

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.869 
to Aladdin and Titus because we find out
in<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.570> straps<00:00:36.809> as<00:00:36.960> well<00:00:37.140> that<00:00:37.350> Titus<00:00:38.040> is<00:00:38.280> Luke

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
in the straps as well that Titus is Luke

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.209 
in the straps as well that Titus is Luke
is<00:00:39.090> inside<00:00:39.629> of<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.260> medium<00:00:40.680> because<00:00:40.980> of<00:00:41.100> no

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
is inside of the medium because of no

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.369 
is inside of the medium because of no
comet<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:41.820> I<00:00:42.540> believe<00:00:42.899> that<00:00:42.930> is<00:00:43.140> definitely

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
comet and I believe that is definitely

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.020 
comet and I believe that is definitely
gonna<00:00:43.500> be<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.710> combination<00:00:43.950> between<00:00:44.399> Titus

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
gonna be a combination between Titus

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.940 
gonna be a combination between Titus
he's<00:00:45.210> gonna<00:00:45.360> use<00:00:45.660> his<00:00:46.020> final<00:00:46.350> act<00:00:46.530> which<00:00:46.739> I

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
he's gonna use his final act which I

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.380 
he's gonna use his final act which I
think<00:00:47.550> that's<00:00:47.670> very<00:00:47.760> appropriate<00:00:47.969> because

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
think that's very appropriate because

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.700 
think that's very appropriate because
one<00:00:48.629> of<00:00:48.660> my<00:00:48.809> favorite<00:00:49.020> characters<00:00:49.500> from<00:00:49.530> the

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
that you know he really did consider

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.590 
that you know he really did consider
Titus<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.190> friend<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.609> he's<00:01:02.730> just<00:01:02.910> distraught

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
Titus a friend and he's just distraught

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.119 
Titus a friend and he's just distraught
about<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:03.989> whole<00:01:04.140> thing<00:01:04.379> but<00:01:04.710> then<00:01:04.830> we<00:01:04.949> also

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
about the whole thing but then we also

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.820 
about the whole thing but then we also
go<00:01:05.460> back<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:05.670> we<00:01:05.909> see<00:01:06.090> that<00:01:06.240> Titus<00:01:07.080> is<00:01:07.320> inside

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
go back and we see that Titus is inside

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.160 
go back and we see that Titus is inside
of<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.159> medium<00:01:08.520> so<00:01:09.000> it's<00:01:09.180> like<00:01:09.330> I<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:09.540> believe

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
of the medium so it's like I I believe

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.679 
of the medium so it's like I I believe
him<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.619> alladin<00:01:11.189> are<00:01:11.369> gonna<00:01:11.700> take<00:01:11.939> down<00:01:12.180> the

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
him and alladin are gonna take down the

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.539 
him and alladin are gonna take down the
medium<00:01:13.110> they're<00:01:13.439> gonna<00:01:13.590> use<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.130> roof<00:01:14.340> and

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
medium they're gonna use the roof and

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:15.980 
medium they're gonna use the roof and
they're<00:01:14.729> gonna<00:01:14.850> pretty<00:01:15.119> much<00:01:15.210> probably

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
they're gonna pretty much probably

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.840 
they're gonna pretty much probably
extinguish<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.979> black<00:01:17.220> roof<00:01:17.430> all<00:01:17.610> around

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
extinguish the black roof all around

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.850 
extinguish the black roof all around
which<00:01:17.970> it'll<00:01:18.180> be<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.299> hell<00:01:19.049> of<00:01:19.080> a<00:01:19.350> freakin<00:01:19.680> hard

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
which it'll be a hell of a freakin hard

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.350 
which it'll be a hell of a freakin hard
thing<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.040> do<00:01:20.250> but<00:01:20.369> that's<00:01:20.490> gonna<00:01:20.700> I<00:01:20.970> believe

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
thing to do but that's gonna I believe

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.060 
thing to do but that's gonna I believe
that's<00:01:21.780> how<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.049> medium<00:01:22.470> will<00:01:22.619> be<00:01:22.740> defeated

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
that's how the medium will be defeated

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.590 
that's how the medium will be defeated
and<00:01:23.250> I<00:01:23.460> think<00:01:23.790> it's<00:01:23.909> just<00:01:23.970> appropriate<00:01:24.479> to

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
and I think it's just appropriate to

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.690 
and I think it's just appropriate to
give<00:01:24.720> ascend<00:01:25.229> up<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.950> Titus<00:01:26.310> character

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
give ascend up to the Titus character

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.789 
give ascend up to the Titus character

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
because he wanted so desperately to just

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.160 
because he wanted so desperately to just
be<00:01:29.009> alive<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:29.970> be<00:01:30.119> with<00:01:30.420> people<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:30.840> whatnot

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
be alive and be with people and whatnot

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.140 
be alive and be with people and whatnot
and<00:01:31.350> he'll<00:01:32.130> always<00:01:32.280> be<00:01:32.400> remembered<00:01:32.520> at<00:01:33.030> the

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
and he'll always be remembered at the

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.789 
and he'll always be remembered at the
very<00:01:33.299> least<00:01:33.479> if<00:01:33.689> he<00:01:33.840> is<00:01:34.079> able<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.380> take<00:01:34.590> down

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
very least if he is able to take down

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.620 
very least if he is able to take down
this<00:01:34.920> medium<00:01:35.310> so<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:35.670> think<00:01:35.880> that<00:01:36.150> that<00:01:36.420> would

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
this medium so I think that that would

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.690 
this medium so I think that that would
be<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.750> great<00:01:37.049> send-off<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:38.369> thing<00:01:38.549> is

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
be a great send-off and the thing is

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.410 
be a great send-off and the thing is
it's<00:01:38.939> like<00:01:38.970> okay<00:01:39.570> so<00:01:40.079> we<00:01:40.200> got<00:01:40.350> now<00:01:40.820> aqua<00:01:41.820> tu<00:01:42.119> and

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
them while Aladdin does what he needs to

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.600 
them while Aladdin does what he needs to
do<00:02:01.409> inside<00:02:01.710> there<00:02:01.950> so<00:02:02.100> he'll<00:02:02.250> be<00:02:02.340> a<00:02:02.369> good

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
do inside there so he'll be a good

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.580 
do inside there so he'll be a good
distraction<00:02:03.030> but<00:02:03.780> think<00:02:04.020> about<00:02:04.079> it<00:02:04.259> is<00:02:04.350> once

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
is there at this point so there's really

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.010 
is there at this point so there's really
not<00:02:57.160> much<00:02:57.430> mystery<00:02:57.940> left<00:02:58.240> of<00:02:58.420> who's<00:02:58.600> going<00:02:58.930> to

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
not much mystery left of who's going to

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.420 
not much mystery left of who's going to
arrive<00:02:59.290> at<00:02:59.500> this<00:02:59.650> point<00:02:59.890> because<00:03:00.160> those<00:03:00.280> were

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
arrive at this point because those were

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.520 
arrive at this point because those were
the<00:03:00.550> last<00:03:00.700> two<00:03:01.000> missing<00:03:01.420> people<00:03:02.260> that<00:03:02.410> we

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
the last two missing people that we

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:03.870 
the last two missing people that we
needed<00:03:02.710> to<00:03:02.830> see<00:03:03.130> of<00:03:03.370> what<00:03:03.520> they<00:03:03.640> were<00:03:03.700> up<00:03:03.850> to

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
needed to see of what they were up to

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.730 
needed to see of what they were up to
and<00:03:04.240> they're<00:03:04.630> there<00:03:04.900> as<00:03:05.020> well<00:03:05.200> so<00:03:05.500> it's<00:03:05.680> like

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:05.740 
and they're there as well so it's like

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.790 
and they're there as well so it's like
everybody's<00:03:06.700> there<00:03:06.940> so<00:03:07.180> even<00:03:07.540> if<00:03:07.660> the<00:03:07.840> manga

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
everybody's there so even if the manga

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.740 
everybody's there so even if the manga
isn't<00:03:09.190> going<00:03:09.430> to<00:03:09.640> I<00:03:09.880> guess<00:03:09.940> and<00:03:10.390> at<00:03:10.600> this

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
isn't going to I guess and at this

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.600 
isn't going to I guess and at this
particular<00:03:10.930> point<00:03:11.440> everybody's<00:03:12.340> just<00:03:12.460> going

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
particular point everybody's just going

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:13.920 
particular point everybody's just going
to<00:03:12.700> escalate<00:03:12.970> even<00:03:13.210> further<00:03:13.510> with<00:03:13.780> their

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
to escalate even further with their

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.240 
to escalate even further with their
power<00:03:14.110> and<00:03:14.320> everything<00:03:14.650> and<00:03:14.800> I<00:03:14.980> don't<00:03:15.040> even

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
power and everything and I don't even

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.770 
power and everything and I don't even
know<00:03:15.430> what<00:03:15.640> will<00:03:15.850> be<00:03:15.970> the<00:03:16.090> final<00:03:16.360> threat<00:03:16.630> after

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
know what will be the final threat after

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.960 
know what will be the final threat after
this<00:03:17.080> because<00:03:17.440> right<00:03:17.920> now<00:03:18.130> the<00:03:18.190> medium<00:03:18.730> it

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
this because right now the medium it

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.640 
this because right now the medium it
seems<00:03:19.570> as<00:03:19.720> though<00:03:19.870> he's<00:03:20.170> going<00:03:20.200> to<00:03:20.530> be

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
seems as though he's going to be

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.860 
seems as though he's going to be
defeated<00:03:20.920> by<00:03:21.250> Titus<00:03:21.760> and<00:03:21.970> Aladdin<00:03:22.390> and<00:03:22.510> then

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
defeated by Titus and Aladdin and then

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.960 
defeated by Titus and Aladdin and then
after<00:03:23.140> that<00:03:23.260> who's<00:03:24.040> to<00:03:24.220> say<00:03:24.340> what's<00:03:24.550> gonna<00:03:24.670> you

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
after that who's to say what's gonna you

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.330 
after that who's to say what's gonna you
know<00:03:25.180> come<00:03:25.390> afterward<00:03:25.810> but<00:03:25.989> uh<00:03:26.340> decent

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
know come afterward but uh decent

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.280 
know come afterward but uh decent
chapter<00:03:27.970> it<00:03:28.150> felt<00:03:28.330> a<00:03:28.420> bit<00:03:28.450> slow<00:03:28.840> in<00:03:29.020> certain

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
chapter it felt a bit slow in certain

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.710 
chapter it felt a bit slow in certain
areas<00:03:29.650> a<00:03:29.680> lot<00:03:29.980> of<00:03:30.330> retrospect<00:03:31.330> and<00:03:31.510> seeing

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
areas a lot of retrospect and seeing

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.510 
areas a lot of retrospect and seeing
once<00:03:31.870> again<00:03:32.110> Muhammad<00:03:32.739> how<00:03:32.860> he<00:03:32.920> still<00:03:33.310> and

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:33.520 
once again Muhammad how he still and

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.610 
once again Muhammad how he still and
hatred<00:03:34.360> and<00:03:34.480> oppression<00:03:34.600> there<00:03:35.170> but<00:03:35.380> you<00:03:35.500> also

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
hatred and oppression there but you also

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.040 
hatred and oppression there but you also
got<00:03:35.860> Titus<00:03:36.250> there<00:03:36.459> so<00:03:36.850> it<00:03:37.239> was<00:03:37.390> a<00:03:37.450> bit<00:03:37.900> slow

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 
got Titus there so it was a bit slow

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:39.570 
got Titus there so it was a bit slow
paced<00:03:38.290> in<00:03:38.410> certain<00:03:38.650> areas<00:03:38.980> but<00:03:39.130> we<00:03:39.250> definitely

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
paced in certain areas but we definitely

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.820 
paced in certain areas but we definitely
got<00:03:39.670> a<00:03:39.700> bit<00:03:40.180> more<00:03:40.330> progression<00:03:40.840> we<00:03:41.080> got<00:03:41.260> I'm

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
got a bit more progression we got I'm

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.380 
got a bit more progression we got I'm
pretty<00:03:42.070> sure<00:03:42.280> was<00:03:42.459> hinted<00:03:42.790> at<00:03:42.910> the<00:03:43.030> very<00:03:43.209> least

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
pretty sure was hinted at the very least

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.150 
pretty sure was hinted at the very least
that<00:03:43.660> yeah<00:03:44.050> Mariah<00:03:44.350> was<00:03:44.650> kind<00:03:44.860> of<00:03:44.890> like<00:03:45.010> in

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
that yeah Mariah was kind of like in

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.520 
that yeah Mariah was kind of like in
relation<00:03:46.150> to<00:03:46.180> Muhammad<00:03:46.959> in<00:03:47.080> the<00:03:47.170> past<00:03:47.380> I

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
relation to Muhammad in the past I

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.320 
relation to Muhammad in the past I
believe<00:03:47.560> it<00:03:47.860> was<00:03:47.950> at<00:03:48.190> least<00:03:48.340> where<00:03:48.610> uh<00:03:48.640> hinted

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.330 
believe it was at least where uh hinted

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:50.790 
believe it was at least where uh hinted
but<00:03:49.750> I'm<00:03:49.840> not<00:03:49.989> sure<00:03:50.170> if<00:03:50.230> it<00:03:50.350> was<00:03:50.470> actually

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
but I'm not sure if it was actually

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:51.900 
but I'm not sure if it was actually
confirmed<00:03:51.190> the<00:03:51.310> whatnot<00:03:51.580> but<00:03:51.700> we<00:03:51.760> got

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
confirmed the whatnot but we got

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.210 
confirmed the whatnot but we got
confirmation<00:03:52.570> in<00:03:53.140> this<00:03:53.530> particular<00:03:53.800> chapter

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
confirmation in this particular chapter

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.160 
confirmation in this particular chapter
that<00:03:54.820> she<00:03:55.120> was<00:03:55.239> like<00:03:55.330> Anna<00:03:55.510> he<00:03:55.930> was<00:03:56.050> an

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
that she was like Anna he was an

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.900 
that she was like Anna he was an
adoptive<00:03:56.590> father<00:03:56.830> to<00:03:57.100> her<00:03:57.220> so<00:03:57.459> we<00:03:57.730> got<00:03:57.880> a

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
adoptive father to her so we got a

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:59.370 
adoptive father to her so we got a
little<00:03:58.060> bit<00:03:58.239> with<00:03:58.330> that<00:03:58.450> as<00:03:58.570> well<00:03:58.690> again<00:03:59.140> we

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
little bit with that as well again we

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:00.990 
little bit with that as well again we
got<00:03:59.530> the<00:03:59.650> revelation<00:04:00.070> that<00:04:00.100> Titus's<00:04:00.610> inside

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
got the revelation that Titus's inside

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.780 
got the revelation that Titus's inside
there<00:04:01.239> and<00:04:01.420> seen<00:04:02.290> Aladdin's<00:04:03.100> reaction<00:04:03.670> to

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
there and seen Aladdin's reaction to

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.850 
there and seen Aladdin's reaction to
finding<00:04:03.970> out<00:04:04.269> that<00:04:04.630> she<00:04:04.900> had<00:04:05.050> aa<00:04:05.170> day<00:04:05.620> and

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
finding out that she had aa day and

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.370 
finding out that she had aa day and
Titus<00:04:06.820> is<00:04:07.030> pretty<00:04:07.450> once<00:04:07.660> dead<00:04:07.900> because<00:04:08.200> I

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
Titus is pretty once dead because I

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:09.780 
Titus is pretty once dead because I
guess<00:04:08.620> he<00:04:08.769> didn't<00:04:08.980> know<00:04:09.010> which<00:04:09.250> I<00:04:09.459> thought<00:04:09.670> he

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
guess he didn't know which I thought he

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.790 
guess he didn't know which I thought he
would<00:04:09.910> have<00:04:10.000> known<00:04:10.150> at<00:04:10.330> least<00:04:10.360> that<00:04:11.080> uh<00:04:11.110> Titus

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:11.800 
would have known at least that uh Titus

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.070 
would have known at least that uh Titus
was<00:04:11.980> gone<00:04:12.160> by<00:04:12.310> now<00:04:12.430> because<00:04:12.790> I<00:04:13.060> thought<00:04:13.840> he<00:04:13.959> was

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.080 
was gone by now because I thought he was

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.990 
was gone by now because I thought he was
sensitive<00:04:14.410> at<00:04:14.620> the<00:04:14.709> very<00:04:14.890> least<00:04:15.070> so<00:04:15.220> um<00:04:15.459> I

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
sensitive at the very least so um I

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.759 
sensitive at the very least so um I
guess<00:04:16.390> we<00:04:16.510> got<00:04:16.630> his<00:04:16.780> reaction<00:04:17.230> there<00:04:17.380> and<00:04:17.650> it's

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
guess we got his reaction there and it's

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.340 
guess we got his reaction there and it's
interesting<00:04:18.010> to<00:04:18.250> see<00:04:18.400> that<00:04:18.430> he<00:04:19.120> yeah<00:04:20.049> he<00:04:20.200> gets

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:05.580 
hopefully the medium gets put down soon
and<00:05:03.970> I'm<00:05:04.060> hoping<00:05:04.330> again<00:05:04.630> that<00:05:04.810> it<00:05:04.990> is<00:05:05.230> my

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
and I'm hoping again that it is my

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.290 
and I'm hoping again that it is my
mainly<00:05:06.160> Titus<00:05:06.610> because<00:05:06.880> I<00:05:06.910> would<00:05:07.120> love<00:05:07.270> for

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
mainly Titus because I would love for

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.150 
mainly Titus because I would love for
him<00:05:07.510> to<00:05:07.600> have<00:05:07.750> some<00:05:08.170> sort<00:05:08.350> of<00:05:08.410> memorial<00:05:08.980> and<00:05:09.100> I

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
him to have some sort of memorial and I

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.530 
him to have some sort of memorial and I
think<00:05:09.370> that<00:05:09.490> would<00:05:09.580> be<00:05:09.760> very<00:05:09.940> appropriate<00:05:10.270> for

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:10.540 
think that would be very appropriate for

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.720 
think that would be very appropriate for
the<00:05:10.690> character<00:05:11.080> that<00:05:11.500> he<00:05:12.070> wasn't<00:05:12.280> necessarily

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:12.730 
the character that he wasn't necessarily

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:14.940 
the character that he wasn't necessarily
human<00:05:13.540> but<00:05:13.720> he<00:05:13.780> wanted<00:05:14.020> to<00:05:14.110> be<00:05:14.230> human<00:05:14.410> and<00:05:14.740> I

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:14.950 
human but he wanted to be human and I

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:16.200 
human but he wanted to be human and I
think<00:05:15.160> he<00:05:15.280> should<00:05:15.310> be<00:05:15.550> remembered<00:05:16.000> as<00:05:16.150> a

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.210 
think he should be remembered as a

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.930 
think he should be remembered as a
person<00:05:16.620> so<00:05:17.620> that's<00:05:18.040> just<00:05:18.370> my<00:05:18.520> whole<00:05:18.670> take<00:05:18.820> on

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
person so that's just my whole take on

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.700 
person so that's just my whole take on
that<00:05:19.090> but<00:05:19.300> again<00:05:19.450> 7<00:05:20.050> out<00:05:20.140> of<00:05:20.170> 10<00:05:20.290> good<00:05:20.530> chap
