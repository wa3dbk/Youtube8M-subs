00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 tell me a little you started to prepare 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.120
 the boxes of cookies is now my home 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.770
 in fact it has become almost a tradition 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.840
 when the month of December begins 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.790
 I immediately prepare all kinds of biscuits 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.099
 form color and then preserve them 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.139
 boxes of dacca and here I have prepared the 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.760
 my list of christmas cookies there 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.840
 I show no these are all 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.619
 speeches that we have already addressed 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.420
 together 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.609
 But missing the cookies 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.380
 canestrelli that today I would like to prepare 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.510
 together with you but reducing the quantity 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.689
 of butter of more than 50 percent 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.570
 let's see the idea to prepare 25 30 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.300
 canestrelli biscuits we need 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:40.620
 100 grams of white flour 100 g of 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:44.390
 starch a hard yolk 50 g of sugar a 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.399
 veil 60 g of butter 50 grams of hazelnuts 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.829
 a pinch of salt 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:52.860
 a sachet of vanillin a couple of 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.890
 tablespoons of milk to serve sugar a 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:59.340
 enough veil in a bowl 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:01.050
 we sift the white flour and combine 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.059
 even the potato starch that he doesn't have 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.690
 need to be sifted but seen 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.049
 that we are there 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.369
 we make it pass through the pollens 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:10.350
 then we said that we want to reduce 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.780
 the amount of butter in here the 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.900
 so what should we use 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.390
 some ingredients that help us 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.740
 kneading such as hazelnuts 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.020
 because in here 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.600
 that is, it hides a part of hatred no 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.640
 we all know that then we put it 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.890
 a bit of hazelnuts 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.890
 and add the icing sugar 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:39.270
 we fly in everything now we have added the 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.119
 hazelnuts sugar we also pass the 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.530
 butter that you trust is much much less 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.530
 compared to traditional recipes 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:53.850
 then now an egg established and then the ok 8 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.520
 clearly whole with the shell for 8 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.850
 10 minutes then I let it cool 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:02.310
 and then I removed the albumen and the sieve 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:08.250
 so i let it go through a 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:11.610
 strainer to make a velvety cream I do 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:14.880
 so of light you can also pass it with 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.370
 the potato masher also the amount of 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.320
 soil that I used used is 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.269
 much lower than the recipes 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:26.640
 classic because I always try to reduce 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:30.959
 fats and sugars flavored with 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:33.000
 vanillina add a pinch of salt 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.329
 and essential when using 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.329
 flour 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:42.510
 but there is another bit of butter ok in the app 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.880
 it will be our ingredient that helps us 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.690
 also this to knead just because 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.220
 the amount of fat is lower 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:53.219
 we mix well until you get one 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:03:03.700
 sort of pastry 

00:02:53.219 --> 00:03:05.859
 adding milk if necessary afterwards 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:09.069
 having kneaded our dough ho 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:10.689
 left to rest under the bowl for 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:13.329
 about 15 minutes so that in short 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:16.389
 the dough could not relax 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:18.609
 a tyrant then much better at work 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:24.849
 a little with hands prepared a little 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:27.389
 flour we sport the plan we crush a 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:30.909
 po with your hands and then with a rolling pin 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:33.220
 we make a disc with the thickness of 

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:35.560
 about a centimeter a little less than i 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:39.840
 canestrelli should be rather thick not 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.840
 there is leaven but we must make them sisti 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.830
 once realized the counting I took 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:51.470
 a mold the classic in short , shaped 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:55.040
 of flower with a diameter of 4 cm e 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.990
 we make our canestrelli then 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.630
 I go directly to an oven plate 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:02.390
 lined with wax paper if I go to 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:04.400
 have discount we cook in this 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:07.720
 so then we also go to impact 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.720
 all pasta scraps 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:21.080
 once these flowers are made 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.820
 we can also make the ring 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:25.970
 internal so you can take one 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:29.060
 stencil with a diameter of one centimeter 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.710
 so it is to remove the interior but I know that 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.230
 this is not found very easily 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.660
 stencil then I suggest you type 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:39.320
 make the handle of a spoon of 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:41.000
 simple wood and it is press in the center 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.800
 which I think is even more beautiful and 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.230
 elegant 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:47.300
 so I suggest this solution 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:50.420
 in the meantime or preheat the oven to 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:53.450
 180 degrees and then I'm going to cook i 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:55.040
 canestrelli for about 10 11 minutes until 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:59.540
 when the surface will appear 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:01.610
 lightly browned a bit of sugar 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:03.290
 veil over and you're done 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.540
 get your biscuits ready in time 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:07.790
 so you will make the whole family happy 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:09.680
 you know I like it a lot to prepare 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:12.290
 cookies in general with my grandchildren 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:14.480
 years from two to one and four years 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:16.100
 I do not tell you flour and icing sugar 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.120
 scattered throughout the kitchen but it is 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:20.230
 really fun 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.230
 happy holidays to you all
