00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:17.820
 paste 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.709
 but 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.719
 as I told you, they will go 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:26.659
 watching and you with a spoon are going to do 

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:28.069
 this I'm going to be sprinkling 

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:32.860
 container edges 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:37.360
 so we are cooking them tranqui aybar 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:38.350
 and little by little we are doing in the city 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.080
 Gothic 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.820
 the pralines this part of putting them 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.070
 water and they are boiling so that 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:48.850
 they serve so that it goes cooking 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:50.890
 also the sad peanuts so the water 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.480
 it will evaporate when there is no more water 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.540
 comes the important moment of the 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:59.890
 Chinese ok prawns but also the 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:03.700
 secret ends it ends here in the 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:05.230
 liquid the water at this time 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.120
 Carlos to where we are going to be 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.879
 returning the 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.950
 so that it is called sugar is reversed 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:14.400
 which means that the 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.400
 sugar 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:20.419
 that sugar is invested is sugar 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:23.240
 You will try to get back to doing what was 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:26.960
 that is to say to be again semolina da is 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:30.380
 always for that when sometimes one 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:32.780
 cook sugar for a pudding for a 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.360
 flan of bonzi cheese but if almost 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.560
 I was ready and returns as a 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.560
 crystallize good that's what it 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:43.130
 look for the garrapiñadas look for now 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:45.050

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.630
 there 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.920
 now I see that they begin to stick between 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:55.070
 yes they stick 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:57.630
 they stick and this is an important moment 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:05:01.710
 you have to be careful so that you 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:04.500
 reverse I can take out now I have mani 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:07.500
 caramelized but have not seen the 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:11.190

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:13.680
 of the claws now look look like 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:16.350

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:27.960
 pralines have everything are red by 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:30.810
 outside the skin has the sugar but it 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.550
 I went back to invest I have the sugar stuck 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:35.310
 but again it dwells around 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:38.250

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:23.460
 at the time that is invested in I'm going to 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:25.230
 be a minute and going around for 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:29.480
 so that the sugar goes back to 

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:35.520
 melt and shine is made 

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:38.250
