00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:10.059
 so get my cock another 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:11.650
 Fund from the patch five points it 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:13.059
 do the exercise program like you 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.390
 If you see me twice here twice 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:18.369
 tank and six times the idea and why 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.320
 we do that is very clear that the 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:23.830
 human is very very high rating 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:26.710
 directly to a spot on the positioning 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.510
 we distribute marx around the boss 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.250
 and to every market we make that 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:33.850
 player to it and what is left is 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:36.220
 then practically every tank as well as 1 2 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.469
 million depending on how many you are in here 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.910
 setup has the positioning includes the 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:42.670
 is very important and indeed out 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.680
 this reason throughout the whole 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.020
 Rides from the g1 always come 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.550
 again these purple over and there 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.350
 Have players as fast as possible 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.360
 purely then if now in half past nine 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.039
 Of course nobody sends in and that 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.590
 is triggered then there is so much 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:59.469
 hurt as another pan-European 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.360
 innovation in the hartz iv very much 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:04.899
 annoying it in this black balls we 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:07.090
 here you can see the spawning players 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:08.859
 position or tight and around that 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.179
 means that every player can do so 

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:11.709
 a bullet appear 

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:13.659
 and now of course you have to be careful 

00:01:11.709 --> 00:01:15.759
 if you go through his ball 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:17.079
 should you have your pet and thereby that in 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:19.779
 the first phase is not high anymore 

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:21.759
 Everything can be kept there 

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:25.689
 something absurd and so far 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:27.399
 new style is of course that is very 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:28.899
 very dangerous so we do it that way 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:32.829
 the ball then you have the entire 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:35.319
 the first phase put these relatively well 

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:37.599
 that means, first of all, take care of that 

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:39.579
 outer edge so as far as it is possible 

00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:41.380
 goes from the forest path and then the more 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:43.719
 balls come close to you moving 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.759
 you also post but of course always with 

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:47.649
 this thought that if an area in 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:49.749
 The near comes so if again swirl 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:53.169
 come near you there you should the 

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:56.469
 can reach and so if and when 

00:01:53.169 --> 00:01:58.869
 There are not three bullets on the way 

00:01:56.469 --> 00:02:01.510
 take the whirl because otherwise will 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:04.600
 the whole thing very close 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:10.000
 otherwise everything is already in the 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:12.310
 normal therefore the post 50 and 100 energy 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.720
 is there just this effect on the ground 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.730
 he previously announced with the 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.240
 We just made that racket 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.310
 just solved that our of hank resp 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:25.300
 non-active take aways marx there 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:27.250
 puts where those punches come with it 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.780
 then all players can see that 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.240
 we then announced shortly before ts 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.070
 this phase can occur and then 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.550
 everyone out there soon as soon as the 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:38.560
 transition phase is the ids and make 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.960
 the whole player recently somehow cool 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.450
 lausanne and so many balls and socks 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.340
 possible all that just things and 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.370
 You will then start in the next phase 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.110
 much much more space therefore have equal 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.420
 take as many balls as possible 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.610
 and the whole will be from our partner 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.220
 thinks single drinks so it works if 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.020
 or even with a marketing if in there 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.640
 Cool and management is then 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.950
 he can take alone there must be 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.410
 the whole world is not in front of the board 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.910
 Collect to catch that is exactly 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.470
 but you can think that alone 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.230
 and he has to do it alone 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.330
 because he gets so sexy 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.040
 if not even 800 couple of revenge and 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.920
 Of course, it does a lot accordingly 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.250
 hurt in the next time on the 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.250
 post Office 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.600
 After we have the intermediate phase 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.790
 has survived by exactly 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.440
 as before in the father described 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.750
 once upon a time as your representative of the 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.450
 Post her accordingly fast 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.580
 in beer gets the whole game 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.080
 starts again from the beginning 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.930
 Of course, you have to do a bit of it now 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:43.690
 watch out the entire encounter is 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.130
 mainly the match in counter that 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.069
 means that it looks new now 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.660
 Recipes at the bigger cadres are available 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:52.239
 everything just class that very much 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.310
 he has a high single target image 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:55.989
 then not so many problems with that 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.900
 boss did but that it then without 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:00.430
 problems before you do business 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.260
 have the first phase again then 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.940
 there's still a Zwischenphase and 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.670
 then he goes to the english and 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.709
 Kill your player gradually 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:11.739
 So there you have to look that he 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:13.060
 practically enough in advance in advance 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:14.560
 the match is coming on the bus 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.239
 that's why we also fight a lot 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.579
 right at the beginning when all drinking 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:22.270
 Brock reports and everything is ready 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:24.040
 pulled right at the pool fight and then 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.690
 let's go what I have not been to 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.820
 The little one was about 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.010
 randomly from topplayer position so 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.810
 if a player is placed high and he 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.790
 lands again appears on this 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.010
 position becomes a little apps that will 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.900
 just come often depends or on the 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:40.810
 active tank depending on who he is doing 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.940
 is drawn to the poster and by the way 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.770
 from penk just around the clips or 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.960
 do not need to support the cds 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:49.510
 they should stay on the post 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.380
 and do as much harm as possible 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.380
 given 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.470
 so we would have the most important points 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.270
 we wish you all 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.500
 Of course, good luck with that 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.370
 you hardly should it be any 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:09.180
 ask questions or give any clarity 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.740
 because just write in the comments to 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.200
 Our team will be as fast as you 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.910
 possible to take care of it and let's go 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.710
 then exactly to your question one should 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:17.970
 you will also have to query how 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.950
 no idea had no driver now 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.840
 think or take a brand thinking that 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:24.810
 but you only have peace and 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.310
 deka or so then that costs in the 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:28.920
 comments and we'll be there then 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.180

 fast as possible so you do not have to 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:38.100
 wait a month but look now 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:40.140
 every day and he will ask 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.620
 you too within 24 hours

 Many Thanks
