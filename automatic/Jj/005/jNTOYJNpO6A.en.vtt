00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.570
 i 

00:00:05.459 --> 00:00:09.519
 very good to all and welcome to this 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.990
 new video of grand theft auto 'online 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:14.410
 nerves I'm going to teach a very cliche 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.750
 funny that you can do easily and 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.910
 pretty fast with what you get that 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.160
 disappear your arms and only 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.500
 see your hands and your torso the 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.599
 true that as I say it is very 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.090
 funny and good directly we're going to 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:30.160
 see how it is done well first of all what 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.140
 what you should know is that you need a 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.940
 home is essential that you have a 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.860
 house because we're going to have to use the 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.049
 wardrobe for here the dressing room for 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.150
 changing clothes would not be worth a 

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:42.220
 clothing store we will not be able to change 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.930
 clothes and we're going to have to go to our 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.600
 house in our closet once we are 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.890
 there I recommend you take off 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.199
 any kind of clothes is a 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.610
 plain shirt and remove them any 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:54.699
 jacket or anything to wear 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.690
 eyes in the upper part of the body what 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:58.540
 first thing we're going to do in when 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.430
 anyone may have that shirt you are going 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.900
 to go to tank tops and you're going to 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.239
 choose the one that you want these new ones that 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.770
 have taken off in the beat boom pack me by 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.729
 example to this video that I would choose from 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.140
 degraded 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:09.789
 you can choose any one is not 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.730
 Necessary that it be that to take the one that more 

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:12.590
 I like you 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.960
 and just after that we're going to go 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.780
 to americanas and we're going to get a 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.190
 jacket over right over me in 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.740
 this case then an open jacket 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:24.530
 black but you can use any of 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.750
 how much we put on the jacket we go 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:30.620
 to change clothes again and let's go 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.030
 to leather jackets and then you can 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.130
 catch any help that I take is the most 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.660
 cheap but with anybody you are going to 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.420
 realize that they disappear 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.710
 our arms we are going to place it and 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.850
 what we are going to do now to be able 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.800
 leave with your arms like that because if 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.480
 we would leave 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.370
 normal what we have to do is give it 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.830
 to start wait for the map to appear 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:54.800
 because if you leave it charging and just 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:57.770
 come out again they would put their arms 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.870
 you're going to give the start as soon as 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.280
 come out the map you give back to the start 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:04.070
 and since you are going to be able to walk 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:07.130
 perfectly arms as if the 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.840
 you can go out and you go to 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.250
 keep your arms so you can do a 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.660
 lots of things 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.760
 driving you can go on a motorcycle you can 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.090
 dropped by parachute and that is because 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.069
 pretty curious 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.860
 Well, when jumping, go up 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.300

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.410
