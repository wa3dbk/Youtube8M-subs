so that's the camera application and

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.090 
so that's the camera application and
let's<00:02:17.600> just<00:02:17.870> go<00:02:17.990> inside<00:02:18.140> the<00:02:18.440> video<00:02:18.710> mode<00:02:18.920> and

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
let's just go inside the video mode and

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.490 
let's just go inside the video mode and
see<00:02:19.280> the<00:02:19.600> options<00:02:20.600> be<00:02:20.720> enough<00:02:20.900> so<00:02:21.380> you<00:02:21.470> can

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
see the options be enough so you can

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.540 
see the options be enough so you can
shoot<00:02:21.800> between<00:02:22.930> various<00:02:23.930> resolutions<00:02:24.550> vele

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
shoot between various resolutions vele

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.730 
shoot between various resolutions vele
the<00:02:26.390> best<00:02:26.570> quality<00:02:26.750> that<00:02:27.020> you<00:02:27.080> can<00:02:27.320> get<00:02:27.440> and

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
then you back you know smaller

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.320 
then you back you know smaller
resolutions<00:02:30.080> for<00:02:30.730> purposes<00:02:31.730> like<00:02:31.910> sending<00:02:32.210> an

using the back and the front video game

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:05.350 
using the back and the front video game
and<00:02:59.200> that's<00:03:02.320> really<00:03:03.320> the<00:03:03.850> camera<00:03:04.850> application

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
and that's really the camera application

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.530 
and that's really the camera application
and<00:03:05.600> let's<00:03:06.410> just<00:03:06.470> take<00:03:06.970> sample<00:03:07.970> shop<00:03:08.180> and<00:03:08.390> see

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
and let's just take sample shop and see

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.330 
and let's just take sample shop and see
how<00:03:08.690> to<00:03:08.750> finish<00:03:09.080> a<00:03:09.320> turkey<00:03:09.680> responds<00:03:10.070> to

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
how to finish a turkey responds to

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:24.680 
how to finish a turkey responds to
taking<00:03:11.180> pictures

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.910 

that's<00:03:25.690> with<00:03:25.900> the<00:03:25.930> pash-shan<00:03:26.409> it<00:03:26.590> did<00:03:26.739> take<00:03:26.890> a

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
that's with the pash-shan it did take a

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.580 
that's with the pash-shan it did take a
little<00:03:27.129> while<00:03:27.400> to<00:03:27.670> find<00:03:28.060> its<00:03:28.299> focus<00:03:28.750> now<00:03:29.319> let's

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
little while to find its focus now let's

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.910 
little while to find its focus now let's
have<00:03:29.799> the<00:03:30.659> flash<00:03:31.659> off<00:03:31.870> and<00:03:32.319> see<00:03:32.560> how<00:03:32.709> quickly

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
have the flash off and see how quickly

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:42.270 
have the flash off and see how quickly
it<00:03:33.129> does<00:03:33.810> taste<00:03:34.810> picture<00:03:40.890> so<00:03:41.890> it<00:03:41.980> is<00:03:42.040> quite

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
it does taste picture so it is quite

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.970 
it does taste picture so it is quite
slow<00:03:42.610> when<00:03:42.879> it<00:03:43.000> comes<00:03:43.209> to<00:03:43.709> getting<00:03:44.709> the<00:03:44.890> right

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
slow when it comes to getting the right

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.440 
slow when it comes to getting the right
focus<00:03:45.220> and<00:03:45.549> taking<00:03:45.760> a<00:03:45.790> picture<00:03:46.000> and<00:03:46.180> getting

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
focus and taking a picture and getting

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.530 
focus and taking a picture and getting
back<00:03:46.599> to<00:03:46.720> the<00:03:46.900> gallery<00:03:47.799> to<00:03:48.010> the<00:03:48.670> image<00:03:48.910> mode<00:03:49.120> or

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
back to the gallery to the image mode or

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.569 
back to the gallery to the image mode or
it<00:03:49.629> still<00:03:49.900> photography<00:03:50.379> good<00:03:50.590> so<00:03:51.010> all<00:03:51.340> in<00:03:51.519> all

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:51.579 
it still photography good so all in all

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:53.400 
it still photography good so all in all
it<00:03:51.730> takes<00:03:51.879> about<00:03:52.030> a<00:03:52.420> second<00:03:52.750> or<00:03:52.870> a<00:03:52.930> little<00:03:53.260> more

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
it takes about a second or a little more

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.250 
it takes about a second or a little more
than<00:03:53.560> a<00:03:53.620> second<00:03:53.980> so<00:03:54.640> obviously<00:03:55.060> it's<00:03:55.209> not<00:03:55.269> the

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
than a second so obviously it's not the

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.849 
than a second so obviously it's not the
best<00:03:57.390> camera<00:03:58.390> but<00:03:58.599> again<00:03:58.959> we<00:03:59.530> should<00:03:59.590> not<00:03:59.799> be

00:03:59.849 --> 00:03:59.859 
best camera but again we should not be

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:01.680 
best camera but again we should not be
forgetting<00:04:00.250> it<00:04:00.340> is<00:04:00.430> it<00:04:00.970> has<00:04:01.150> a<00:04:01.180> price<00:04:01.420> one

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
forgetting it is it has a price one

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.030 
forgetting it is it has a price one
which<00:04:01.810> is<00:04:01.900> very<00:04:02.079> budget<00:04:02.379> friendly<00:04:02.410> and<00:04:02.890> they

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
which is very budget friendly and they

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.220 
which is very budget friendly and they
try<00:04:03.250> to<00:04:03.310> give<00:04:03.579> you<00:04:03.700> the<00:04:03.849> best<00:04:04.000> everything<00:04:04.930> they

could<00:04:05.410> fit<00:04:06.010> into<00:04:06.160> this<00:04:06.690> budget-friendly

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
could fit into this budget-friendly

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.440 
could fit into this budget-friendly
price<00:04:08.079> so<00:04:08.739> you<00:04:09.489> know<00:04:09.609> let's<00:04:09.910> not<00:04:10.120> have<00:04:10.299> very

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
price so you know let's not have very

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.020 
price so you know let's not have very
high<00:04:10.599> expectations<00:04:10.930> from<00:04:11.379> this<00:04:11.620> it<00:04:12.190> it<00:04:12.760> does

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
high expectations from this it it does

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.449 
high expectations from this it it does
get<00:04:13.269> job<00:04:13.660> done<00:04:13.900> and<00:04:14.109> that<00:04:14.950> is<00:04:15.040> what's<00:04:15.250> more

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
get job done and that is what's more

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:20.039 
get job done and that is what's more
important<00:04:16.289> with<00:04:17.289> this<00:04:17.320> device<00:04:18.239> so<00:04:19.239> that's<00:04:19.959> it

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
important with this device so that's it

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:21.839 
important with this device so that's it
