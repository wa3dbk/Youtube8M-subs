it's<00:00:08.270> winter<00:00:08.990> here<00:00:09.200> cold<00:00:09.680> haven't<00:00:10.130> been

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:10.220 
it's winter here cold haven't been

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:11.380 
it's winter here cold haven't been
writing<00:00:10.430> much<00:00:10.700> so<00:00:10.880> we've<00:00:11.030> been<00:00:11.120> doing<00:00:11.240> some

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:11.390 
writing much so we've been doing some

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:13.810 
writing much so we've been doing some
maintenance<00:00:11.660> on<00:00:12.020> our<00:00:12.050> bikes<00:00:12.460> after<00:00:13.460> the<00:00:13.580> hum

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:13.820 
maintenance on our bikes after the hum

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.839 
maintenance on our bikes after the hum
and<00:00:14.120> the<00:00:14.680> autumn<00:00:15.680> wand<00:00:15.980> arrives<00:00:16.340> that<00:00:16.580> I<00:00:16.640> went

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:16.849 
and the autumn wand arrives that I went

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:18.519 
and the autumn wand arrives that I went
on<00:00:17.029> I<00:00:17.060> managed<00:00:17.660> to<00:00:17.689> pull<00:00:17.960> the<00:00:18.050> suspension

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:18.529 
on I managed to pull the suspension

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:20.500 
on I managed to pull the suspension
apart<00:00:18.830> on<00:00:18.950> the<00:00:19.070> elephant<00:00:19.460> and<00:00:20.060> this<00:00:20.180> is<00:00:20.330> one<00:00:20.480> of

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:20.510 
apart on the elephant and this is one of

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:22.450 
apart on the elephant and this is one of
the<00:00:20.689> unfortunate<00:00:21.320> things<00:00:21.349> that<00:00:21.770> I<00:00:21.800> found

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
the unfortunate things that I found

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.609 
the unfortunate things that I found
it's<00:00:22.939> a<00:00:23.060> shaft<00:00:23.330> that<00:00:23.599> goes<00:00:23.810> in<00:00:23.990> the<00:00:24.080> suspension

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:24.619 
it's a shaft that goes in the suspension

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:26.439 
it's a shaft that goes in the suspension
linkage<00:00:24.980> and<00:00:25.220> because<00:00:26.119> of<00:00:26.150> lack<00:00:26.420> of

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:26.449 
linkage and because of lack of

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:28.510 
linkage and because of lack of
lubrication<00:00:27.080> by<00:00:27.410> the<00:00:27.470> dreaded<00:00:27.980> previous

owner the hard facing of the shaft has

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:32.710 
owner the hard facing of the shaft has
just<00:00:31.279> been<00:00:31.430> completely<00:00:31.820> butchered<00:00:32.390> and<00:00:32.540> worn

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:32.720 
just been completely butchered and worn

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.080 
just been completely butchered and worn
off<00:00:32.900> the<00:00:33.110> other<00:00:33.230> end<00:00:33.320> isn't<00:00:33.769> even<00:00:34.010> isn't<00:00:34.820> even

00:00:36.939 --> 00:00:36.949 
much better being a Cagiva elephant

much better being a Cagiva elephant
where<00:00:37.370> you<00:00:37.519> get<00:00:37.699> parts<00:00:38.180> you<00:00:38.449> can't<00:00:38.720> buy<00:00:38.870> this

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
where you get parts you can't buy this

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.079 
where you get parts you can't buy this
part<00:00:39.350> anymore<00:00:39.590> trained<00:00:40.159> how<00:00:40.370> to<00:00:40.400> look<00:00:40.640> also<00:00:40.879> at

the<00:00:41.210> suspension<00:00:42.080> on<00:00:42.199> the<00:00:42.290> monster<00:00:42.710> this<00:00:43.129> shaft

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:43.400 
the suspension on the monster this shaft

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.820 
the suspension on the monster this shaft
is<00:00:43.670> the<00:00:43.909> right<00:00:44.120> internal<00:00:45.019> and<00:00:45.199> external

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:45.830 
is the right internal and external

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.110 
is the right internal and external
diameter<00:00:46.640> to<00:00:47.600> fit<00:00:47.650> my<00:00:48.650> linkage<00:00:49.250> but<00:00:49.760> it's<00:00:49.940> too

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
diameter to fit my linkage but it's too

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.960 
diameter to fit my linkage but it's too
long<00:00:50.330> so<00:00:51.320> the<00:00:51.650> next<00:00:51.830> that's<00:00:52.070> fine<00:00:52.430> we'll<00:00:52.760> just

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:52.970 
long so the next that's fine we'll just

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.670 
long so the next that's fine we'll just
cut<00:00:53.150> up<00:00:53.299> well<00:00:53.479> how<00:00:53.659> do<00:00:53.720> you<00:00:53.870> cut<00:00:54.080> it<00:00:54.199> it's<00:00:54.440> hard

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
cut up well how do you cut it it's hard

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.920 
cut up well how do you cut it it's hard
and<00:00:54.860> steal<00:00:55.100> a<00:00:55.400> hacksaw<00:00:56.150> won't<00:00:56.420> go<00:00:56.600> through<00:00:56.809> it

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
and steal a hacksaw won't go through it

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.660 
and steal a hacksaw won't go through it
you<00:00:57.470> can't<00:00:57.739> just<00:00:57.949> stick<00:00:58.100> it<00:00:58.250> on<00:00:58.339> a<00:00:58.370> lathe

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
you can't just stick it on a lathe

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.939 
you can't just stick it on a lathe
because<00:00:59.479> the<00:00:59.720> tool<00:00:59.930> won't<00:01:00.260> cut<00:01:00.530> through<00:01:00.559> it

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 
because the tool won't cut through it

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:03.039 
because the tool won't cut through it
finally<00:01:01.430> found<00:01:01.610> this<00:01:01.760> diagram<00:01:02.330> of<00:01:02.600> someone

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:03.049 
finally found this diagram of someone

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:05.980 
finally found this diagram of someone
who<00:01:03.619> would<00:01:03.739> rig<00:01:03.949> something<00:01:04.220> up<00:01:04.430> that<00:01:04.960> when<00:01:05.960> I

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
who would rig something up that when I

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.899 
who would rig something up that when I
spoke<00:01:06.320> to<00:01:06.380> Trent<00:01:06.740> Trent<00:01:06.979> said<00:01:07.400> I<00:01:07.430> think<00:01:07.700> we<00:01:07.790> can

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
spoke to Trent Trent said I think we can

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:09.730 
spoke to Trent Trent said I think we can
actually<00:01:08.090> do<00:01:08.420> that<00:01:08.630> so<00:01:08.840> come<00:01:09.170> over<00:01:09.229> here<00:01:09.619> and

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
actually do that so come over here and

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.380 
actually do that so come over here and
we'll<00:01:10.040> show<00:01:10.280> you<00:01:10.310> or<00:01:10.670> maybe<00:01:10.880> I<00:01:11.000> should<00:01:11.090> take

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
we'll show you or maybe I should take

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.690 
we'll show you or maybe I should take
the<00:01:11.450> camera<00:01:11.869> Trent<00:01:12.590> and<00:01:12.740> you<00:01:12.859> should<00:01:13.070> explain

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
the camera Trent and you should explain

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:14.410 
the camera Trent and you should explain
what<00:01:13.939> it<00:01:14.090> is

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
what it is

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.440 
what it is
I'll<00:01:15.259> just<00:01:15.439> get<00:01:15.560> Trent<00:01:15.890> to<00:01:15.950> pull<00:01:16.159> this<00:01:16.450> bracket

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
I'll just get Trent to pull this bracket

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.630 
I'll just get Trent to pull this bracket
out<00:01:17.570> of<00:01:17.869> the<00:01:17.990> tool<00:01:18.530> post<00:01:18.829> on<00:01:19.130> the<00:01:19.250> lathe<00:01:19.430> and

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
out of the tool post on the lathe and

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.649 
out of the tool post on the lathe and
show<00:01:19.909> us<00:01:20.060> what<00:01:20.359> it<00:01:20.479> actually<00:01:20.630> is<00:01:22.450> there<00:01:23.450> it<00:01:23.570> is

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
show us what it actually is there it is

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:25.510 
show us what it actually is there it is
this<00:01:24.079> one<00:01:24.320> this<00:01:24.469> is<00:01:24.530> just<00:01:24.649> basically<00:01:25.219> a<00:01:25.310> piece

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
this one this is just basically a piece

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.060 
this one this is just basically a piece
of<00:01:25.640> angle<00:01:25.759> iron<00:01:26.000> with<00:01:26.929> a<00:01:26.960> flat<00:01:27.289> welded<00:01:27.920> onto

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
of angle iron with a flat welded onto

of angle iron with a flat welded onto
the<00:01:28.310> onto<00:01:28.789> the<00:01:28.969> back<00:01:29.090> edge<00:01:30.130> pretty

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
the onto the back edge pretty

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.609 
the onto the back edge pretty
straightforward<00:01:31.759> and<00:01:31.909> a<00:01:32.289> dremel<00:01:33.289> just<00:01:33.439> sits

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
straightforward and a dremel just sits

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:35.380 
straightforward and a dremel just sits
in<00:01:33.770> the<00:01:33.890> be<00:01:34.009> drama<00:01:34.700> needs<00:01:34.909> to<00:01:34.969> be<00:01:35.060> nice<00:01:35.179> and

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
in the be drama needs to be nice and

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:36.310 
in the be drama needs to be nice and
square<00:01:35.570> you<00:01:35.659> don't<00:01:35.810> want<00:01:35.929> it<00:01:35.990> to<00:01:36.049> be<00:01:36.140> on<00:01:36.200> an

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
square you don't want it to be on an

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.319 
square you don't want it to be on an
angle<00:01:36.619> otherwise<00:01:36.829> you<00:01:37.009> kind<00:01:37.159> of<00:01:37.219> cut<00:01:37.399> across

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:38.329 
angle otherwise you kind of cut across

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:39.940 
angle otherwise you kind of cut across
the<00:01:38.539> face<00:01:38.719> like<00:01:38.899> that<00:01:39.140> effectively<00:01:39.770> we're

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
the face like that effectively we're

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.599 
the face like that effectively we're
just<00:01:40.100> going<00:01:40.969> to<00:01:41.030> put<00:01:41.149> the<00:01:41.270> Bush<00:01:41.450> into<00:01:42.380> the

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:42.609 
just going to put the Bush into the

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:45.279 
just going to put the Bush into the
lathe<00:01:43.609> we<00:01:43.909> can<00:01:44.270> obviously<00:01:44.390> use<00:01:44.600> the<00:01:44.869> lathe<00:01:45.020> to

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:45.289 
lathe we can obviously use the lathe to

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:48.459 
lathe we can obviously use the lathe to
move<00:01:45.439> the<00:01:45.619> Dremel<00:01:45.890> around<00:01:47.109> and<00:01:48.109> we'll<00:01:48.289> just

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:48.469 
move the Dremel around and we'll just

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:50.679 
move the Dremel around and we'll just
gently<00:01:49.009> slowly<00:01:49.609> cut<00:01:49.909> through<00:01:50.210> at<00:01:50.359> the<00:01:50.450> point

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:50.689 
gently slowly cut through at the point

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:52.889 
gently slowly cut through at the point
where<00:01:51.079> we<00:01:51.229> to<00:01:51.710> make<00:01:51.829> it<00:01:51.979> the<00:01:52.039> same<00:01:52.189> length<00:01:52.429> as

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 
where we to make it the same length as

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:55.059 
where we to make it the same length as
that's<00:01:53.899> the<00:01:54.020> old<00:01:54.140> one<00:01:54.289> so<00:01:54.469> the<00:01:54.560> reason<00:01:54.920> we<00:01:55.039> have

00:01:55.059 --> 00:01:55.069 
that's the old one so the reason we have

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:57.249 
that's the old one so the reason we have
to<00:01:55.340> use<00:01:55.460> the<00:01:55.579> dremel<00:01:55.969> is<00:01:56.119> because<00:01:56.539> to<00:01:56.689> cut<00:01:56.929> part

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
to use the dremel is because to cut part

00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:59.230 
to use the dremel is because to cut part
and<00:01:57.439> steel<00:01:57.710> you<00:01:58.219> don't<00:01:58.399> cut<00:01:58.640> it<00:01:58.670> you<00:01:58.880> if<00:01:59.030> you

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
and steel you don't cut it you if you

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.059 
and steel you don't cut it you if you
grind<00:01:59.600> it<00:01:59.810> really<00:02:00.140> don't<00:02:00.350> you<00:02:00.530> yeah<00:02:00.859> exactly

00:02:01.059 --> 00:02:01.069 
grind it really don't you yeah exactly

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:02.349 
grind it really don't you yeah exactly
right<00:02:01.399> yeah<00:02:01.549> so<00:02:01.700> we're<00:02:01.789> not<00:02:01.880> really<00:02:02.030> cutting

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:02.359 
right yeah so we're not really cutting

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:04.090 
right yeah so we're not really cutting
it<00:02:02.539> wheel<00:02:02.659> will<00:02:02.929> be<00:02:02.960> yeah<00:02:03.469> just<00:02:03.679> grinding<00:02:04.039> it

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
it wheel will be yeah just grinding it

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.770 
it wheel will be yeah just grinding it
away<00:02:04.310> slowly<00:02:04.700> and<00:02:04.999> because<00:02:05.240> it's<00:02:05.389> spinning<00:02:05.689> in

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
away slowly and because it's spinning in

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.450 
away slowly and because it's spinning in
the<00:02:05.840> lathe<00:02:05.990> it<00:02:06.229> just<00:02:06.409> it's<00:02:06.679> just<00:02:06.770> cutting<00:02:07.130> or

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
the lathe it just it's just cutting or

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.279 
the lathe it just it's just cutting or
grinding<00:02:07.700> a<00:02:08.119> groove<00:02:08.690> and<00:02:08.899> I'll<00:02:09.050> just<00:02:09.170> go

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
grinding a groove and I'll just go

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:10.480 
grinding a groove and I'll just go
around<00:02:09.500> around<00:02:09.710> around<00:02:09.860> around<00:02:10.069> until<00:02:10.399> it

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
around around around around until it

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.480 
around around around around until it
cuts<00:02:11.360> right<00:02:11.569> through<00:02:11.630> you<00:02:12.230> can<00:02:12.380> see<00:02:12.680> the<00:02:12.920> sort

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
cuts right through you can see the sort

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.059 
cuts right through you can see the sort
of<00:02:13.550> the<00:02:13.700> fiber<00:02:14.180> sort<00:02:14.930> of<00:02:15.020> in<00:02:15.260> the<00:02:15.739> disc<00:02:15.950> that's

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
of the fiber sort of in the disc that's

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.890 
of the fiber sort of in the disc that's
sort<00:02:16.280> of<00:02:16.310> holding<00:02:16.610> it<00:02:16.700> all<00:02:16.790> together<00:02:16.940> so<00:02:17.269> it's

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
sort of holding it all together so it's

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.530 
sort of holding it all together so it's
kind<00:02:18.080> of<00:02:18.110> a<00:02:18.230> reinforced<00:02:18.890> embrace<00:02:19.370> yeah

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
kind of a reinforced embrace yeah

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.199 
kind of a reinforced embrace yeah
right<00:02:20.810> okay<00:02:21.500> what<00:02:21.920> set<00:02:22.129> it<00:02:22.159> up<00:02:23.140> so<00:02:24.140> the<00:02:24.290> old<00:02:24.439> one

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
right okay what set it up so the old one

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.750 
right okay what set it up so the old one
was<00:02:26.209> around<00:02:26.569> seventy<00:02:27.109> seven<00:02:27.409> point<00:02:27.590> three<00:02:27.760> now

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
was around seventy seven point three now

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.490 
was around seventy seven point three now
I<00:02:28.790> was<00:02:28.909> was<00:02:29.090> explaining<00:02:29.450> before<00:02:29.719> that<00:02:30.260> the

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
I was was explaining before that the

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.890 
I was was explaining before that the
length<00:02:30.739> of<00:02:30.920> this<00:02:31.010> is<00:02:31.219> not<00:02:31.549> hugely<00:02:32.150> critical<00:02:32.719> a

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
length of this is not hugely critical a

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.089 
length of this is not hugely critical a
little<00:02:33.319> bit<00:02:33.409> longer<00:02:33.590> is<00:02:33.709> not<00:02:33.799> going<00:02:33.950> to<00:02:34.010> make

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
little bit longer is not going to make

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:35.770 
little bit longer is not going to make
that<00:02:34.189> much<00:02:34.340> difference<00:02:34.370> then<00:02:34.849> when<00:02:35.030> we<00:02:35.150> say<00:02:35.329> if

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
that much difference then when we say if

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:36.910 
that much difference then when we say if
it's<00:02:35.959> a<00:02:36.019> little<00:02:36.140> bit<00:02:36.319> longer<00:02:36.469> we're<00:02:36.650> talking

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
it's a little bit longer we're talking

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.610 
it's a little bit longer we're talking
like<00:02:37.069> maybe<00:02:37.700> a<00:02:37.849> half<00:02:38.150> a<00:02:38.299> mil<00:02:38.480> something<00:02:38.959> we're

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
like maybe a half a mil something we're

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.250 
like maybe a half a mil something we're
not<00:02:39.650> talking<00:02:40.129> 10<00:02:40.250> mils<00:02:40.489> or<00:02:40.700> anything<00:02:40.849> silly

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
not talking 10 mils or anything silly

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:48.550 
not talking 10 mils or anything silly
mu1<00:02:46.030> 99.5<00:02:47.030> so<00:02:47.930> what<00:02:48.079> do<00:02:48.139> you<00:02:48.200> want<00:02:48.319> to<00:02:48.379> take

mu1 99.5 so what do you want to take

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.979 
mu1 99.5 so what do you want to take
about<00:02:48.829> 22<00:02:49.400> millimeters<00:02:49.939> off<00:02:50.090> at<00:02:50.269> ninety<00:02:50.840> nine

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
about 22 millimeters off at ninety nine

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.020 
about 22 millimeters off at ninety nine
nine<00:02:51.200> to<00:02:51.260> seventy<00:02:51.560> seven<00:02:51.920> twenty<00:02:52.639> two<00:02:52.819> milk

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
nine to seventy seven twenty two milk

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.879 
nine to seventy seven twenty two milk
sounds<00:02:53.420> about<00:02:53.599> right<00:02:53.629> to<00:02:53.930> me<00:02:53.959> so<00:02:54.260> you<00:02:54.799> just

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:54.889 
sounds about right to me so you just

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:56.710 
sounds about right to me so you just
kind<00:02:55.370> of<00:02:55.430> measure<00:02:55.579> back<00:02:55.790> from<00:02:55.849> the<00:02:56.120> tip<00:02:56.299> oh<00:02:56.480> I

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
kind of measure back from the tip oh I

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:03.399 
kind of measure back from the tip oh I
guess<00:02:56.989> I<00:02:57.200> yet<00:03:01.480> alright<00:03:02.480> here<00:03:02.750> we<00:03:02.780> go

00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:03.409 
guess I yet alright here we go

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:05.379 
guess I yet alright here we go
don't<00:03:04.129> leak<00:03:04.280> cost<00:03:04.459> me<00:03:04.579> seven<00:03:04.849> include<00:03:05.209> that

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:05.389 
don't leak cost me seven include that

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:45.350 
don't leak cost me seven include that
chart

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.339 

when<00:03:46.360> you<00:03:46.420> get<00:03:46.569> towards<00:03:46.720> the<00:03:46.900> center<00:03:47.200> the

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:47.349 
when you get towards the center the

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:49.790 
when you get towards the center the
grinder<00:03:47.739> really<00:03:48.010> started<00:03:48.370> to<00:03:48.489> labor<00:03:48.700> and<00:03:49.000> the

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 
grinder really started to labor and the

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.100 
grinder really started to labor and the
grinding<00:03:50.800> disk<00:03:50.980> just<00:03:51.220> started<00:03:51.519> to<00:03:51.640> disappear

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
grinding disk just started to disappear

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.270 
grinding disk just started to disappear
because<00:03:53.110> I<00:03:53.230> guess<00:03:53.470> the<00:03:53.620> hardening<00:03:54.040> on<00:03:54.160> the

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
because I guess the hardening on the

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.160 
because I guess the hardening on the
inside<00:03:54.610> of<00:03:54.849> the<00:03:54.940> shaft<00:03:55.150> and<00:03:55.480> in<00:03:55.690> the<00:03:55.810> tunnel

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
inside of the shaft and in the tunnel

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.530 
inside of the shaft and in the tunnel
that<00:03:56.319> has<00:03:57.069> it<00:03:57.220> hasn't<00:03:57.640> hasn't<00:03:57.940> it<00:03:58.150> hasn't<00:03:58.300> been

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
that has it hasn't hasn't it hasn't been

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.470 
that has it hasn't hasn't it hasn't been
dressed<00:03:58.930> back<00:03:59.400> you<00:04:00.400> know<00:04:00.549> like<00:04:00.970> the<00:04:01.120> outside

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
dressed back you know like the outside

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:02.789 
dressed back you know like the outside
of<00:04:01.569> the<00:04:01.629> shaft<00:04:01.870> oh<00:04:02.049> so<00:04:02.260> it's<00:04:02.410> probably<00:04:02.650> a<00:04:02.709> lot

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
of the shaft oh so it's probably a lot

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:05.430 
of the shaft oh so it's probably a lot
more<00:04:02.980> of<00:04:03.160> it<00:04:03.280> on<00:04:03.340> the<00:04:03.489> inside<00:04:03.959> so<00:04:04.959> I<00:04:04.989> guess<00:04:05.230> we

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
more of it on the inside so I guess we

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.869 
more of it on the inside so I guess we
just<00:04:05.470> need<00:04:05.769> to<00:04:05.920> tidy<00:04:06.190> up<00:04:06.310> that<00:04:06.400> end<00:04:06.670> of<00:04:06.819> it

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:06.879 
just need to tidy up that end of it

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:08.190 
just need to tidy up that end of it
because<00:04:07.090> it's<00:04:07.239> got<00:04:07.360> a<00:04:07.420> little<00:04:07.629> bit<00:04:07.810> of<00:04:07.900> a<00:04:07.989> ridge

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
because it's got a little bit of a ridge

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:20.800

Pablo me seventy seven point three also
has<00:04:32.880> a<00:04:32.970> lucky<00:04:33.270> guess<00:04:33.600> close<00:04:34.200> enough<00:04:34.590> oh<00:04:34.740> man<00:04:35.070> so

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640 
has a lucky guess close enough oh man so

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.220 
has a lucky guess close enough oh man so
what<00:04:35.760> are<00:04:35.820> you<00:04:35.880> going<00:04:35.970> to<00:04:36.030> do<00:04:36.150> there<00:04:36.360> yeah<00:04:36.630> put

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230 
what are you going to do there yeah put

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.620 
what are you going to do there yeah put
the<00:04:37.440> dremel<00:04:38.190> at<00:04:38.310> an<00:04:38.430> angle<00:04:38.820> here<00:04:39.240> we'll<00:04:39.480> just

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
the dremel at an angle here we'll just

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.470 
the dremel at an angle here we'll just
turn<00:04:39.780> on<00:04:39.930> a<00:04:40.050> bit<00:04:40.170> an<00:04:40.230> angle<00:04:40.590> and<00:04:40.770> just<00:04:41.450> give<00:04:42.450> a

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480 
turn on a bit an angle and just give a

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.580 
turn on a bit an angle and just give a
slight<00:04:42.930> taper<00:04:43.280> the<00:04:44.280> reason<00:04:44.610> being<00:04:44.820> this<00:04:45.240> one

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
slight taper the reason being this one

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.870 
slight taper the reason being this one
bit<00:04:46.590> hard<00:04:46.800> to<00:04:46.860> see<00:04:47.130> but<00:04:47.310> it's<00:04:47.460> got<00:04:47.610> a<00:04:47.640> slight

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
bit hard to see but it's got a slight

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.510 
bit hard to see but it's got a slight
taper<00:04:48.180> there<00:04:48.480> so<00:04:48.630> when<00:04:48.840> you<00:04:48.870> push<00:04:49.170> it<00:04:49.320> through

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
taper there so when you push it through

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.340 
taper there so when you push it through
it<00:04:50.520> doesn't<00:04:50.850> catch<00:04:51.060> on<00:04:51.330> it<00:04:51.900> doesn't<00:04:52.170> have<00:04:52.260> an

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
it doesn't catch on it doesn't have an

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.290 
it doesn't catch on it doesn't have an
edge<00:04:52.470> to<00:04:52.500> catch<00:04:52.890> on<00:04:53.130> bearings<00:04:53.670> and<00:04:53.820> seals<00:04:54.000> and

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
edge to catch on bearings and seals and

00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:01.279 
edge to catch on bearings and seals and
things

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:01.289 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:06.209 

so<00:05:02.289> they<00:05:03.039> are<00:05:03.309> side<00:05:03.549> by<00:05:03.579> side<00:05:03.759> I<00:05:05.219> surprised

00:05:06.209 --> 00:05:06.219 
so they are side by side I surprised

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:08.219 
so they are side by side I surprised
they<00:05:06.339> easy<00:05:06.519> that<00:05:06.729> was<00:05:06.849> actually<00:05:07.179> yeah<00:05:07.629> I<00:05:07.959> knew

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:08.229 
they easy that was actually yeah I knew

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:10.349 
they easy that was actually yeah I knew
you<00:05:08.469> a<00:05:08.499> saying<00:05:08.859> that<00:05:08.979> you<00:05:09.309> can<00:05:09.549> do<00:05:09.699> it<00:05:09.849> grind

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:10.359 
you a saying that you can do it grind

00:05:10.359 --> 00:05:11.939 
you a saying that you can do it grind
valves<00:05:10.839> and<00:05:10.989> stuff<00:05:11.169> with<00:05:11.349> this<00:05:11.439> sort<00:05:11.679> of<00:05:11.739> setup

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:11.949 
valves and stuff with this sort of setup

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:13.829 
valves and stuff with this sort of setup
that's<00:05:12.189> right<00:05:12.369> I<00:05:12.399> don't<00:05:12.669> see<00:05:12.819> why<00:05:12.999> if<00:05:13.359> you<00:05:13.599> if

00:05:13.829 --> 00:05:13.839 
that's right I don't see why if you if

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:15.449 
that's right I don't see why if you if
you<00:05:13.929> did<00:05:14.079> it<00:05:14.199> nice<00:05:14.349> and<00:05:14.379> accurately<00:05:14.859> I'll<00:05:15.159> put

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:15.459 
you did it nice and accurately I'll put

00:05:15.459 --> 00:05:17.759 
you did it nice and accurately I'll put
the<00:05:15.549> valve<00:05:15.789> in<00:05:15.939> here<00:05:16.239> and<00:05:16.419> spin<00:05:17.079> this<00:05:17.259> probably

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:17.769 
the valve in here and spin this probably

00:05:17.769 --> 00:05:20.249 
the valve in here and spin this probably
I<00:05:17.979> guess<00:05:18.339> it's<00:05:18.489> 45<00:05:18.789> degrees<00:05:19.149> for<00:05:19.359> a<00:05:19.389> valve<00:05:19.629> auto

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:20.259 
I guess it's 45 degrees for a valve auto

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:22.259 
I guess it's 45 degrees for a valve auto
60<00:05:20.649> or<00:05:20.769> something<00:05:20.889> all<00:05:21.369> right<00:05:21.429> cheers<00:05:21.789> fireman

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:22.269 
60 or something all right cheers fireman

00:05:22.269 --> 00:05:24.329 
60 or something all right cheers fireman
don't<00:05:22.599> worry<00:05:22.989> do<00:05:23.499> the<00:05:23.679> rest<00:05:24.129> of<00:05:24.249> the

don't worry do the rest of the

00:05:24.339 --> 00:05:39.119 
don't worry do the rest of the
suspension<00:05:24.549> now
