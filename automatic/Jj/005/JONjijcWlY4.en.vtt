00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.910
 good morning to all from spy project.com 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.120
 today we present the locator 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:22.630
 satellite content 

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:27.400
 in a tin box suitable for being 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:30.370
 then inserted on metal surfaces 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:34.460
 fair and articulated vehicles 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:36.410
 any excavator control 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:40.820
 application for this locator is 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:43.640
 possible because it is tin and in that 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.340
 and shockproof and because the two are magnetic 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:49.129
 magnets together therefore both form 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.260
 an attraction force of 120 kg a 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:54.379
 tear then we proceed to the 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:57.650
 description of the locator on 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:01:01.070
 locator inside has one 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:04.900
 12,000 milian battery for his 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:07.700
 antenna is an insert for the sim card 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.920
 we have already seen the operation of 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.520
 by itself of the locator in the video 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.490
 previous one 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:16.400
 so I'll just give you one 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.950
 brief illustration of what it does 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.010
 to do the locator so let's put it 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:25.760
 the sim and turn on the locator 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:29.360
 we close the tin box we attack it 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:32.740
 under the vehicle to be monitored can 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:36.200
 be it an articulated vehicle 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.090
 a car and a any means 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.780
 let's say to check 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:44.750
 after which we send a text message to the sim 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.180
 within contained is the locator 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.030
 will respond immediately with the 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.430
 position that can be given by a link 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.980
 on google map can be given by 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.810
 exact address where the 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:02.060
 locator or even can 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:04.280
 be set by gprs ie 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.390
 through our site you will be able to 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.709
 see via web 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:13.819
 the shifts and constants and every 10 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:16.010
 seconds of the actual position in which the 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.930
 locator is operating this is 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.410
 very convenient in case of management of 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.390
 fleets 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:24.549
 so we are talking about 5 10 20 vehicles 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.680
 and with only one control panel 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:27.970
 we will be able to have on a map 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.830
 owner 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.480
 all positions held by ours 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.490
 vehicles if we want it instead 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.990
 there is no single use 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.730
 no problem can be done anyway 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.400
 the control panel for one 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.710
