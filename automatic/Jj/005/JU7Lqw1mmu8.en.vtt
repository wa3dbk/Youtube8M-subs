maybe<00:00:22.170> we<00:00:22.289> can<00:00:22.439> choose<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.800> next<00:00:23.010> six<00:00:23.640> or

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
maybe we can choose the next six or

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.330 
maybe we can choose the next six or
seven<00:00:24.000> year<00:00:24.119> old<00:00:24.269> but<00:00:24.900> it's<00:00:25.769> got<00:00:25.920> me<00:00:26.039> thinking

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
things we're doing today we're seeing a

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.710 
things we're doing today we're seeing a
lot<00:00:29.189> of<00:00:29.279> people<00:00:29.519> is<00:00:29.609> having<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:29.939> receive<00:00:30.359> a

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
lot of people is having to receive a

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.810 
lot of people is having to receive a
really<00:00:31.679> really<00:00:31.920> deep<00:00:32.130> bottom<00:00:32.369> position

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
really really deep bottom position

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.270 
really really deep bottom position
without<00:00:32.969> just<00:00:33.360> being<00:00:33.739> overextended<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:35.160> is

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
without just being overextended and is

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.860 
without just being overextended and is
that<00:00:35.430> hip<00:00:35.640> starts<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.030> run<00:00:36.180> into<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.450> femur

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
that hip starts to run into the femur

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.049 
that hip starts to run into the femur
one<00:00:37.710> of<00:00:37.770> these<00:00:37.860> two<00:00:37.950> happens<00:00:38.309> is<00:00:38.399> that<00:00:38.520> so<00:00:38.820> ask

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
one of these two happens is that so ask

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.910 
one of these two happens is that so ask
works<00:00:39.450> hard<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:39.930> close<00:00:40.260> that<00:00:40.649> distance

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
works hard to close that distance

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.770 
works hard to close that distance
because<00:00:41.820> otherwise<00:00:42.090> I'll<00:00:42.390> fall<00:00:42.629> over

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
because otherwise I'll fall over

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.479 
because otherwise I'll fall over
backwards<00:00:42.930> so<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.530> distance<00:00:43.860> I<00:00:44.040> start<00:00:44.399> to

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
backwards so the distance I start to

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.970 
backwards so the distance I start to
receive<00:00:44.820> them<00:00:45.090> me<00:00:45.960> starts<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.379> come<00:00:46.590> in<00:00:46.739> or<00:00:46.920> I

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
receive them me starts to come in or I

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.470 
receive them me starts to come in or I
start<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.280> close<00:00:47.460> that<00:00:47.700> distance<00:00:47.879> the

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
start to close that distance the

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.330 
start to close that distance the
pretentiously<00:00:48.899> overextends<00:00:49.590> me<00:00:49.710> so<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:50.219> work

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
pretentiously overextends me so to work

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.180 
pretentiously overextends me so to work
on<00:00:50.520> that<00:00:50.670> position<00:00:50.960> some<00:00:51.960> over<00:00:52.199> today<00:00:52.469> so<00:00:52.680> go

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
on that position some over today so go

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.850 
on that position some over today so go

different piece of it could this Karachi

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.380 
different piece of it could this Karachi
a<00:01:21.590> growing<00:01:22.070> region<00:01:22.490> that<00:01:23.000> I<00:01:23.030> normally

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
a growing region that I normally

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.330 
a growing region that I normally
wouldn't<00:01:23.930> have<00:01:24.050> access<00:01:24.350> to<00:01:24.530> so<00:01:25.100> I'm<00:01:25.160> just

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
wouldn't have access to so I'm just

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:26.920 
wouldn't have access to so I'm just
gonna<00:01:25.430> Pliny<00:01:25.910> out<00:01:26.060> and<00:01:26.270> I'm<00:01:26.390> just<00:01:26.600> gonna<00:01:26.690> do<00:01:26.900> a

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
gonna Pliny out and I'm just gonna do a

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.050 
gonna Pliny out and I'm just gonna do a
good<00:01:27.200> groin<00:01:27.560> stretch<00:01:27.950> but<00:01:28.520> as<00:01:28.670> it<00:01:28.880> actually

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
good groin stretch but as it actually

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.150 
good groin stretch but as it actually
relates<00:01:29.480> to<00:01:29.660> an<00:01:30.140> actual<00:01:30.530> movement<00:01:30.950> in<00:01:31.040> this

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:31.160 
relates to an actual movement in this

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.520 
relates to an actual movement in this
case<00:01:31.370> receiving<00:01:32.210> position<00:01:32.630> what's<00:01:33.110> nice<00:01:33.350> is

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
case receiving position what's nice is

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.200 
case receiving position what's nice is
that<00:01:33.560> I've<00:01:33.710> taken<00:01:33.890> my<00:01:34.130> low<00:01:34.280> back<00:01:34.310> out<00:01:34.820> of<00:01:34.880> the

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
that I've taken my low back out of the

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:36.880 
that I've taken my low back out of the
equation<00:01:35.720> because<00:01:35.930> it's<00:01:36.080> totally<00:01:36.230> supported

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
equation because it's totally supported

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.350 
equation because it's totally supported
and<00:01:37.220> I<00:01:37.370> don't<00:01:37.520> even<00:01:37.610> have<00:01:37.760> to<00:01:37.910> worry<00:01:38.150> about

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
and I don't even have to worry about

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.970 
and I don't even have to worry about
overextending<00:01:39.290> you're<00:01:39.380> screwing<00:01:39.620> my<00:01:39.710> back<00:01:39.890> to

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:39.980 
overextending you're screwing my back to

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.510 
overextending you're screwing my back to
ideas<00:01:40.250> so<00:01:40.430> just<00:01:40.910> I<00:01:41.150> hit<00:01:41.870> that<00:01:42.020> big<00:01:42.320> release<00:01:42.740> and

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
ideas so just I hit that big release and

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.100 
ideas so just I hit that big release and
maybe<00:01:43.730> you're<00:01:43.910> working<00:01:44.060> on<00:01:44.300> distal<00:01:44.750> pectineus

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110

you'll test-retest is just getting into
a<00:01:54.050> squat<00:01:54.380> and<00:01:54.740> then<00:01:55.070> I<00:01:55.250> just<00:01:55.460> block<00:01:55.700> your<00:01:55.910> feet

a squat and then I just block your feet
down<00:01:56.270> every<00:01:56.810> so<00:01:56.990> often

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
down every so often

down every so often
keep<00:01:57.980> pushing<00:01:58.400> out<00:01:58.580> and<00:01:58.820> if<00:01:58.970> this<00:01:59.300> would<00:01:59.480> be

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
keep pushing out and if this would be

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.050

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
I could do this I would be the best in

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.520 
I could do this I would be the best in
the<00:02:04.280> world<00:02:04.400> so<00:02:04.700> take<00:02:05.450> a<00:02:05.480> look<00:02:05.690> at<00:02:05.750> this<00:02:05.870> let's

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
the world so take a look at this let's

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:07.930 
the world so take a look at this let's
go<00:02:06.680> look<00:02:06.860> three<00:02:07.190> or<00:02:07.280> four<00:02:07.430> minutes<00:02:07.700> digging

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
go look three or four minutes digging

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.540 
go look three or four minutes digging
around<00:02:08.000> this<00:02:08.240> but<00:02:08.660> then<00:02:09.190> since<00:02:10.190> that's<00:02:10.399> a

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
around this but then since that's a

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:11.980 
around this but then since that's a
tricky<00:02:10.970> position<00:02:11.150> to<00:02:11.570> be<00:02:11.780> in

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
tricky position to be in

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.840 
tricky position to be in
and<00:02:12.290> that<00:02:12.860> so<00:02:13.070> s<00:02:13.220> tends<00:02:13.460> to<00:02:13.490> come<00:02:13.640> forward

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
and that so s tends to come forward

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.910 
and that so s tends to come forward
let's<00:02:14.060> throw<00:02:14.240> that<00:02:14.390> so<00:02:14.690> a<00:02:14.720> stretch<00:02:15.380> back<00:02:15.680> in

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
let's throw that so a stretch back in

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.570 
let's throw that so a stretch back in
here<00:02:16.220> where<00:02:16.940> I'm<00:02:17.030> going<00:02:17.150> to<00:02:17.210> reach<00:02:17.450> behind
