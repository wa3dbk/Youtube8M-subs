00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
budge it and everyone will be able to do

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.580 
budge it and everyone will be able to do
it<00:03:50.850> and<00:03:52.489> the<00:03:53.489> good<00:03:53.730> thing<00:03:53.760> about<00:03:54.000> this<00:03:54.590> this

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
it and the good thing about this this

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.670 
it and the good thing about this this
thing<00:03:55.830> uninfected<00:03:56.250> is<00:03:56.610> that<00:03:57.030> if<00:03:57.750> they<00:03:58.050> if

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
thing uninfected is that if they if

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.220 
thing uninfected is that if they if
another<00:03:58.950> guy<00:03:59.190> even<00:03:59.520> knows<00:04:00.090> this<00:04:00.330> glitch<00:04:00.660> and

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
another guy even knows this glitch and

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:02.540 
another guy even knows this glitch and
try<00:04:01.440> to<00:04:01.500> get<00:04:01.650> in<00:04:01.739> you<00:04:01.920> can<00:04:02.040> just<00:04:02.190> shoot<00:04:02.370> him

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
try to get in you can just shoot him

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.100 
try to get in you can just shoot him
before<00:04:02.820> it<00:04:03.060> gets<00:04:03.180> in<00:04:03.360> it's<00:04:03.600> really<00:04:03.810> hard<00:04:03.900> to

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
before it gets in it's really hard to

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.840 
before it gets in it's really hard to
get<00:04:04.230> in<00:04:04.320> if<00:04:04.620> you<00:04:04.890> don't<00:04:05.070> know<00:04:05.220> how<00:04:05.430> to<00:04:05.459> do<00:04:05.730> it

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
get in if you don't know how to do it

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.630 
get in if you don't know how to do it
and<00:04:06.030> even<00:04:06.930> if<00:04:07.350> you<00:04:07.560> do<00:04:07.980> know<00:04:08.160> how<00:04:08.250> to<00:04:08.280> do<00:04:08.520> it

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
and even if you do know how to do it

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.979 
and even if you do know how to do it
it's<00:04:09.330> like<00:04:09.950> it<00:04:10.950> will<00:04:11.190> take<00:04:11.400> a<00:04:11.430> while<00:04:11.640> it<00:04:12.450> can

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
it's like it will take a while it can

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.259 
it's like it will take a while it can
take<00:04:13.110> a<00:04:13.170> while<00:04:13.260> sometimes<00:04:13.620> but<00:04:14.070> the<00:04:14.880> mostest

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
take a while sometimes but the mostest

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:20.420 
take a while sometimes but the mostest
time<00:04:15.450> takes<00:04:15.750> like<00:04:16.620> about<00:04:17.630> 10<00:04:18.630> for<00:04:19.530> backboards

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
time takes like about 10 for backboards

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.390 
time takes like about 10 for backboards
i<00:04:21.169> was<00:04:22.169> lucky<00:04:22.380> there<00:04:22.650> i<00:04:22.680> just<00:04:22.770> made<00:04:23.190> it<00:04:23.280> in
