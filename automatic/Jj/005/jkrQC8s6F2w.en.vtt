happy birthday ercoupe it's been 75
years<00:00:26.859> since<00:00:27.189> you<00:00:27.340> first<00:00:27.579> came<00:00:27.730> on<00:00:28.119> the<00:00:28.150> market

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
years since you first came on the market

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.229 
years since you first came on the market
it<00:00:29.619> was<00:00:29.710> designed<00:00:30.189> originally<00:00:30.789> in<00:00:30.939> the<00:00:31.060> late

00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:31.239 
it was designed originally in the late

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:33.330 
it was designed originally in the late
30s<00:00:31.660> as<00:00:31.899> a<00:00:31.930> safety<00:00:32.290> airplane<00:00:32.829> they<00:00:33.070> had<00:00:33.190> a<00:00:33.220> lot

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:33.340 
30s as a safety airplane they had a lot

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.180 
30s as a safety airplane they had a lot
of<00:00:33.370> stall<00:00:33.760> and<00:00:34.000> spin<00:00:34.180> accidents<00:00:34.960> back<00:00:35.140> then<00:00:35.410> so

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 
of stall and spin accidents back then so

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.340 
of stall and spin accidents back then so
this<00:00:36.489> airplane<00:00:37.239> was<00:00:37.390> designed<00:00:37.449> with<00:00:37.989> a<00:00:38.019> very

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
this airplane was designed with a very

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.430 
this airplane was designed with a very
forgiving<00:00:38.920> wing<00:00:39.489> and<00:00:39.850> a<00:00:40.480> limited<00:00:40.870> amount<00:00:41.110> of

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
forgiving wing and a limited amount of

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.189 
forgiving wing and a limited amount of
up<00:00:41.829> elevator<00:00:42.190> travel<00:00:42.790> and<00:00:43.000> what<00:00:43.809> that<00:00:43.960> did<00:00:44.140> was

00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:44.199 
up elevator travel and what that did was

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:48.600 
up elevator travel and what that did was
make<00:00:45.159> it<00:00:45.720> basically<00:00:46.720> stall<00:00:47.589> proof<00:00:48.010> yeah<00:00:48.550> you

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610 
make it basically stall proof yeah you

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.729 
make it basically stall proof yeah you
can<00:00:48.879> stall<00:00:49.180> it<00:00:49.390> but<00:00:49.930> it'll<00:00:50.170> come<00:00:50.320> out<00:00:50.470> of<00:00:50.620> it

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
can stall it but it'll come out of it

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:53.579 
can stall it but it'll come out of it
very<00:00:50.769> quickly<00:00:51.370> its<00:00:52.210> docile<00:00:52.750> in<00:00:52.899> every<00:00:53.110> way<00:00:53.290> and

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:53.589 
very quickly its docile in every way and

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:56.039 
very quickly its docile in every way and
even<00:00:53.890> better<00:00:54.100> easy<00:00:54.610> to<00:00:54.939> fly<00:00:55.180> thanks<00:00:55.689> to<00:00:55.839> some

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:56.049 
even better easy to fly thanks to some

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:58.170 
even better easy to fly thanks to some
clever<00:00:56.229> engineering<00:00:56.949> so<00:00:57.460> you<00:00:57.519> had<00:00:57.729> a<00:00:57.760> low-wing

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 
clever engineering so you had a low-wing

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.259 
clever engineering so you had a low-wing
monoplane<00:00:58.479> with<00:00:58.809> trailing<00:00:59.379> link<00:00:59.530> main<00:00:59.799> gear

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:00.269 
monoplane with trailing link main gear

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:03.539 
monoplane with trailing link main gear
tricycle<00:01:01.269> landing<00:01:01.299> gear<00:01:01.659> and<00:01:02.189> it's<00:01:03.189> steered

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:03.549 
tricycle landing gear and it's steered

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:06.600 
tricycle landing gear and it's steered
on<00:01:03.729> the<00:01:03.820> ground<00:01:04.059> using<00:01:04.750> the<00:01:05.260> yoke<00:01:05.439> so<00:01:05.770> it<00:01:06.460> was

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
on the ground using the yoke so it was

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.480 
on the ground using the yoke so it was
very<00:01:06.850> simple<00:01:07.299> control<00:01:07.950> philosophy<00:01:08.950> behind<00:01:09.130> it

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
very simple control philosophy behind it

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.320 
very simple control philosophy behind it
the<00:01:09.909> H<00:01:10.060> tail<00:01:10.509> is<00:01:11.009> designed<00:01:12.009> also<00:01:12.340> with<00:01:12.970> a

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
the H tail is designed also with a

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.670 
the H tail is designed also with a
purpose<00:01:14.310> those<00:01:15.600> vertical<00:01:16.600> stabilizers<00:01:17.380> are

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
purpose those vertical stabilizers are

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.950 
purpose those vertical stabilizers are
out<00:01:18.100> of<00:01:18.130> the<00:01:18.430> prop<00:01:18.700> blaster<00:01:19.270> so<00:01:19.570> you<00:01:19.630> have

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
out of the prop blaster so you have

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.130 
out of the prop blaster so you have
reduced<00:01:20.590> P<00:01:20.950> factor<00:01:21.579> at<00:01:22.299> high<00:01:22.689> angles<00:01:23.049> of

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
reduced P factor at high angles of

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.920 
reduced P factor at high angles of
attack<00:01:23.229> so<00:01:24.189> it<00:01:24.340> trims<00:01:24.640> up<00:01:24.820> very<00:01:25.060> well<00:01:25.119> but<00:01:25.780> as

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
attack so it trims up very well but as

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.960 
attack so it trims up very well but as
always<00:01:26.200> the<00:01:26.650> best<00:01:26.680> way<00:01:27.070> to<00:01:27.100> experience<00:01:27.670> the

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
always the best way to experience the

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.540 
always the best way to experience the
ercoupe<00:01:28.330> is<00:01:28.600> to<00:01:28.810> fly<00:01:29.080> it<00:01:29.140> I<00:01:29.500> took<00:01:29.710> our<00:01:30.070> intern

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
ercoupe is to fly it I took our intern

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.390 
ercoupe is to fly it I took our intern
Matt<00:01:31.360> Orlov<00:01:31.840> up<00:01:32.350> for<00:01:32.620> a<00:01:32.650> ride

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:33.400 
Matt Orlov up for a ride

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.730 
Matt Orlov up for a ride
Matt's<00:01:34.030> got<00:01:34.240> about<00:01:34.480> 10<00:01:34.810> hours<00:01:35.200> and<00:01:35.470> he's

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
Matt's got about 10 hours and he's

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.950 
Matt's got about 10 hours and he's
working<00:01:36.159> on<00:01:36.250> his<00:01:36.400> private<00:01:36.850> pilot<00:01:37.270> certificate

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
working on his private pilot certificate

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.370 
working on his private pilot certificate
so<00:01:38.350> it's<00:01:38.530> lineup<00:01:39.040> time<00:01:39.340> full<00:01:40.120> power<00:01:40.360> and<00:01:40.690> climb

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
so it's lineup time full power and climb

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.080 
so it's lineup time full power and climb
away<00:01:41.650> at<00:01:41.860> 75<00:01:42.520> miles<00:01:42.820> an<00:01:43.030> hour<00:01:44.370> after<00:01:45.370> takeoff<00:01:45.790> I

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
away at 75 miles an hour after takeoff I

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.120 
away at 75 miles an hour after takeoff I
turned<00:01:46.630> the<00:01:46.750> controls<00:01:47.140> over<00:01:47.470> to<00:01:47.500> Matt<00:01:49.620> with<00:01:50.620> 85

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
turned the controls over to Matt with 85

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.340 
turned the controls over to Matt with 85
horsepower<00:01:51.670> it's<00:01:52.030> not<00:01:52.210> a<00:01:52.240> powerful<00:01:52.900> airplane

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
horsepower it's not a powerful airplane

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:54.330 
horsepower it's not a powerful airplane
that's<00:01:53.620> for<00:01:53.860> sure

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
that's for sure

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.600 
that's for sure
the<00:01:55.180> climb<00:01:55.510> rates<00:01:55.780> today<00:01:56.110> were<00:01:56.409> 600<00:01:57.220> feet<00:01:57.370> per

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
the climb rates today were 600 feet per

it's<00:02:07.159> warm<00:02:07.520> out<00:02:07.700> so<00:02:08.149> we<00:02:08.269> slide<00:02:08.569> the<00:02:08.840> canopy

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
it's warm out so we slide the canopy

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.119 
it's warm out so we slide the canopy
halves<00:02:09.530> down<00:02:09.920> for<00:02:10.220> some<00:02:10.399> open<00:02:10.729> cockpit<00:02:11.000> fly

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
and Matt's doing just fine he even tries

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:18.460
