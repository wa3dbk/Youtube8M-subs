okay<00:00:03.240> so<00:00:03.300> this<00:00:03.629> will<00:00:03.780> be<00:00:03.929> a<00:00:03.959> demo<00:00:04.920> of<00:00:05.040> some<00:00:05.970> of

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
okay so this will be a demo of some of

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:18.870 
okay so this will be a demo of some of

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:27.490 
rotating stator magnets just a little

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.120 
rotating stator magnets just a little
bit<00:00:27.610> and<00:00:27.790> if<00:00:27.849> you're<00:00:28.000> in<00:00:28.090> the<00:00:28.180> right<00:00:28.330> spot<00:00:29.130> we

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.130 
bit and if you're in the right spot we

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.060 
bit and if you're in the right spot we
take<00:00:30.340> on<00:00:30.579> this<00:00:31.570> one<00:00:31.810> is<00:00:31.960> the<00:00:32.110> middle<00:00:32.379> magnet

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.070 
take on this one is the middle magnet

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.370 
take on this one is the middle magnet
over<00:00:33.370> here

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:35.380 
over here

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.940 
over here

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:39.950 
like no kinetic judson dampers pulleys

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.500 
like no kinetic judson dampers pulleys
are<00:00:40.760> for<00:00:41.510> eventual<00:00:41.989> friction<00:00:42.470> testing

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
are for eventual friction testing

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.350 
are for eventual friction testing
okay<00:00:44.260> now<00:00:44.470> it<00:00:45.130> takes<00:00:45.340> a<00:00:45.520> couple<00:00:45.670> of<00:00:45.880> tries<00:00:46.090> to

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.360 
okay now it takes a couple of tries to

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.910 
okay now it takes a couple of tries to
get<00:00:46.480> it<00:00:46.570> started<00:00:46.870> what<00:00:47.230> I'm<00:00:47.350> going<00:00:47.500> to<00:00:47.530> do<00:00:47.710> is

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
get it started what I'm going to do is

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.080 
get it started what I'm going to do is
spin<00:00:48.520> the<00:00:49.180> rotor<00:00:50.010> clockwise<00:00:51.010> by<00:00:51.370> hand<00:00:51.790> and

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.090 
spin the rotor clockwise by hand and

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.360 
spin the rotor clockwise by hand and
then<00:00:52.629> I'm<00:00:52.780> going<00:00:53.020> to<00:00:53.079> and<00:00:53.860> you'll<00:00:54.100> note<00:00:54.340> that

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
then I'm going to and you'll note that

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.810 
then I'm going to and you'll note that
the<00:00:54.900> stator<00:00:55.900> magnets<00:00:56.320> will<00:00:56.590> spin<00:00:56.620> gear<00:00:57.579> wise

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
the stator magnets will spin gear wise

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.600 
the stator magnets will spin gear wise
that<00:00:58.239> is<00:00:58.390> anti-clockwise<00:00:59.110> then<00:00:59.650> I'm<00:01:00.400> going<00:01:00.550> to

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.610 
that is anti-clockwise then I'm going to

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.460 
that is anti-clockwise then I'm going to
stop<00:01:00.850> this<00:01:01.089> magnet<00:01:01.600> and<00:01:01.890> spin<00:01:02.890> it<00:01:04.170> anti<00:01:05.170> gear

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
stop this magnet and spin it anti gear

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:06.930 
stop this magnet and spin it anti gear
wise<00:01:05.680> and<00:01:06.130> see<00:01:06.280> if<00:01:06.400> I<00:01:06.460> can<00:01:06.610> get<00:01:06.729> it<00:01:06.820> to

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:06.940 
wise and see if I can get it to

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:13.990 
wise and see if I can get it to
synchronize

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.770 

it<00:01:14.420> takes

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.490 

several<00:01:17.590> tries<00:01:17.860> as<00:01:18.220> you<00:01:18.340> can<00:01:18.520> see<00:01:19.320> so<00:01:20.320> we

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
several tries as you can see so we

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:35.590 
several tries as you can see so we
couldn't<00:01:21.100> quite<00:01:21.340> catch<00:01:21.700> it

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.430 

there<00:01:36.110> it<00:01:36.230> goes<00:01:36.620> okay<00:01:37.070> now<00:01:37.280> as<00:01:37.520> you<00:01:37.940> can<00:01:38.120> see

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
there it goes okay now as you can see

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.950 
there it goes okay now as you can see
once<00:01:39.440> that<00:01:39.680> magnet<00:01:40.100> starts<00:01:40.670> spinning<00:01:41.090> the

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
once that magnet starts spinning the

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.700 
once that magnet starts spinning the
assembly<00:01:43.540> accelerates

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.780 

just<00:01:48.710> to<00:01:48.860> show<00:01:49.040> you

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
just to show you

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.959 
just to show you

the

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.030 

little<00:02:03.230> magnet<00:02:03.620> is<00:02:03.740> going

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:16.790 

4200<00:02:08.040> rpm

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.809 

well<00:02:17.370> also<00:02:17.730> 1288

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.370 

she's<00:02:21.819> like<00:02:21.970> in<00:02:22.120> here<00:02:22.480> some<00:02:22.660> here<00:02:22.780> action<00:02:23.020> here

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
she's like in here some here action here

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.800 
she's like in here some here action here
between<00:02:23.620> the<00:02:24.040> fluorescent<00:02:24.819> light<00:02:25.000> and<00:02:25.240> his

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
between the fluorescent light and his

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.040 
between the fluorescent light and his
feet<00:02:26.110> about<00:02:26.380> Meg<00:02:26.650> there<00:02:27.160> anyway<00:02:27.430> say<00:02:28.050> about

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
feet about Meg there anyway say about

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:39.350 
feet about Meg there anyway say about
1700<00:02:29.950> rpm<00:02:31.590> now<00:02:32.590> I'm<00:02:32.800> going<00:02:33.010> to<00:02:33.100> stop<00:02:34.500> DC<00:02:35.500> United

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.910 

I<00:02:39.450> don't<00:02:40.020> know<00:02:40.080> if<00:02:40.170> you<00:02:40.230> can<00:02:40.350> hear<00:02:40.560> it<00:02:40.590> or<00:02:40.770> not

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
I don't know if you can hear it or not

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:49.040 
I don't know if you can hear it or not
that<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.370> assembly<00:02:41.820> is<00:02:41.850> speeding<00:02:42.390> up

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.150 

haha

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.880 

okay<00:02:54.790> so<00:02:54.880> now<00:02:55.240> we're<00:02:55.480> over<00:02:55.750> 4,000<00:02:56.560> almost

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
okay so now we're over 4,000 almost

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.590 
okay so now we're over 4,000 almost
5,000<00:02:57.670> rpm<00:02:58.060> on<00:02:58.510> a<00:02:58.570> small<00:02:59.170> magnet
