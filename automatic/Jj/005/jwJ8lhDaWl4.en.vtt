00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.719
 hello let's do some nails that are going to 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.580
 be like that very according to the 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:15.260
 events event will happen in 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.840
 true as of this Friday that are 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.480
 the olympics and it's a very nice design 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:24.050
 very simple really, it's nothing 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:26.150
 complicated that it seemed and those are 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.920
 the glazes that we are going to occupy this me 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.060
 love and now they will see what is it 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.130
 what are we going to do good we paint 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.370
 our nails true first of one of 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:37.880
 blue the others the next two what 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.840
 let's paint in white the one that follows goes 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.510
 to be also blue 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.579
 the last one we will leave it clean 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:47.030
 because we are going to occupy the enamel 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:51.200
 magnetic that they saw at the beginning is 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.579
 good to apply your glaze and now I think 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.329
 it's going to be first to make a line going 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:55.329
 to be a cross 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.440
 go to the future 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:05.720
 since we made the cross we are going to grab 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:08.330
 our chopsticks and we are going to make other 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:12.640
 lines so that it is done as type 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.640
 araÃ±ita is what we are going to do 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:23.530
 we are going to give small taps to 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:27.720
 make the lines a little thinner 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.720
 that we did first 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.050
 since we have as well as that type 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:36.190
 spiders and now let's grab the 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:38.990
 red enamel and let's 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:41.270
 paint a line 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:45.159
 the first created that truth within the 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.159
 first lines we did 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:54.380
 we arrived giving little touches 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.780
 this is in case one has the enamels 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.940
 decorators that is perfect only with 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.130
 sticks or with what I put them and in the 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.770
 good screen since we have the cross 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.200
 already done they did not have to cover what 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.030
 white good now let's start giving 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.810
 small taps on the other lines 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.370
 do not go to join the red lines or 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.140
 that the red line that we're going to 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.970
 start to do noto that the other ok 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.470
 we leave a little bit like that 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.920
 taken off so you do not miss the 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.920
 effect 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.530
 and I tell them that nothing happens if they do not 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.750
 it looks perfect 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.879
 so I know pretty only when it 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.099
 they do it to other people and they try 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:40.540
 do it like that very very nice then 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:40.540
 so that it looks professional no 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.760
 Now what are we going to do? Let's 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:50.590
 start making the rings the hoops that 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.739
 they are the symbol 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:57.010
 the wolf I do not know how to say it but good 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:58.959
 you understand me doing the hoops and 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.550
 they can make them to two big ones to the 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.349
 small can do it vertically in 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.379
 horizontal as you like me 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:06.879
 to make little ones and how I'm going to do it 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:09.549
 I 'm going to do it by giving small 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:11.200
 I'm little touches for 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:13.480
 go doing the circles I think it's the 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.879
 best way we can have to do 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.730
 our circle since we have finished 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:23.069
 to make our circles what we 're going 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:26.560
 to do is write the word 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:28.030
 london2012 that we are going to do the same with 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.310
 the chopsticks are going to do the word 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:33.010
 london 2012 since we have finished that 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.620
 as I am from Mexico truth and support to 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.019
 the Mexicans because I start doing my 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:41.019
 little flag you can do the 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:43.840
 flag of their countries very simple to 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:46.030
 green white red and in the part of 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.340
 speak white white better said is 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.230
 like the word mexico but ya and ya 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:54.700
 I have done my first four nails 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:56.560
 I take my little green magnetic glaze and 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.220
 this is the magnet with which we are going to 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.340
 to work 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:04.180
 there are three ways that you put them 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:07.210
 on the newly applied enamel and ready 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.340
 it's all because we've done this what 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:12.460
 we do is put our enamel 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:16.030
 our shine and ready there are 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:18.280
 our very Olympic nails I hope that 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.380
 like the idea take care of us 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.060
 We see you soon and God come first 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.910

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:29.790
