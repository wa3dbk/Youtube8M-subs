00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.980
 I'm wearing a normal sock and a fluffy sock 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.500
 Turn the black sock inside out 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.600
 Place it horizontally and draw the shapes of the ears 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:28.260
 I'm using concealer to make the lines more visible 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.940
 This is the way he wants 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.500
 Make sure it is very close to the heel 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.660
 Now thing along the line 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.620
 Cut the ears 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.380
 And turn it in the right direction 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.020
 Take two small balls of stuffing 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.560
 And fill your ears 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.480
 Then, take a big ball and fill your head 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.920
 Take a huge ball of filler for the body 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.840
 The sock is elastic, therefore everything fits inside 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.120
 Now seal the base with a running stitch 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.980
 Pull the white sock over the plush 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.800
 Find the seam of the sock 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.920
 Take this out again so it's not directly in the ears 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.680
 Cut a tiny hole above the ears 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.480
 And pull carefully from the ear 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.880
 Draw small circles for the eyes 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.300
 Cut them very carefully 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.520
 Sew the edges of the white sock on the black 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.540
 Use small stitches and keep them close together 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.260
 Do the same for the ears 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.880
 You can lightly fill the inside of the face 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.320
 A very small amount of filler works for this 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.380
 Once you are happy with the way 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.060
 Just cut and seal the base 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.160
 Cut two circles out of the remaining black sock 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.580
 Next, use these to make the arms 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.960
 It can adapt to a surprising amount of filling here 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.820
 Join both arms on the panda 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.520
 Take two beads or buttons for the eyes 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.300
 And sew these in the center of the black part 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.700
 Hide the thread that comes out through the ear 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.580
 Cut a black felt mouth shape 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.760
 Next, attach it with a little cloth glue 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.580
 You can add cheeks with royal flush 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.180
 AND READY!
