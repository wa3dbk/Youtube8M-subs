00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
I've had to go through and route out the

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.560 
I've had to go through and route out the
holes<00:02:17.020> with<00:02:17.410> that<00:02:17.650> out<00:02:17.920> or<00:02:18.280> that<00:02:18.459> tool<00:02:19.390> i

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
holes with that out or that tool i

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.510 
holes with that out or that tool i
showed<00:02:19.870> you<00:02:19.900> before<00:02:20.170> that<00:02:20.650> old<00:02:21.280> hand<00:02:21.520> tool<00:02:21.730> and

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
there's a new bridge up close now

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.310 
there's a new bridge up close now
there's<00:02:26.230> no<00:02:26.320> strings<00:02:26.650> on<00:02:26.800> it<00:02:28.050> i'll<00:02:29.050> try<00:02:29.260> to

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
there's no strings on it i'll try to

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.920 
there's no strings on it i'll try to
show<00:02:29.410> you<00:02:29.590> step-by-step<00:02:30.120> what<00:02:31.120> took<00:02:31.390> to<00:02:31.660> them

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
show you step-by-step what took to them

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.800 
show you step-by-step what took to them
what's<00:02:32.530> going<00:02:32.650> to<00:02:32.739> take<00:02:32.920> to<00:02:33.100> do<00:02:33.280> this<00:02:33.600> put<00:02:34.600> the

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
what's going to take to do this put the

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.720 
what's going to take to do this put the
new<00:02:35.140> parts<00:02:35.500> inside<00:02:35.800> of<00:02:36.100> it<00:02:36.220> the<00:02:37.030> smaller<00:02:37.390> shaft

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
new parts inside of it the smaller shaft

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.449 
new parts inside of it the smaller shaft
come<00:02:39.730> on<00:02:39.850> second<00:02:40.209> show<00:02:40.690> the<00:02:42.810> shorter<00:02:43.810> shaft

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
come on second show the shorter shaft

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.729 
come on second show the shorter shaft
potentiometers<00:02:46.230> this<00:02:47.230> should<00:02:47.380> be<00:02:47.470> much

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
potentiometers this should be much

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:49.199 
potentiometers this should be much
easier<00:02:47.950> to<00:02:48.190> get<00:02:48.310> in<00:02:48.489> and<00:02:48.550> out<00:02:48.670> of<00:02:48.730> that<00:02:48.820> guitar

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
easier to get in and out of that guitar

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.060 
easier to get in and out of that guitar
