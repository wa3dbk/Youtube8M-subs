beginning<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.210> think<00:01:42.329> that<00:01:42.630> shows<00:01:43.229> like<00:01:43.590> here

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
beginning to think that shows like here

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.859 
beginning to think that shows like here
comes<00:01:43.920> honey<00:01:44.369> boo<00:01:44.610> boo<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:45.030> other<00:01:45.630> programs

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
comes honey boo boo and other programs

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.899 
comes honey boo boo and other programs
like<00:01:46.200> that<00:01:46.229> swamp<00:01:46.710> people<00:01:46.950> that<00:01:47.310> that<00:01:47.490> focus

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
like that swamp people that that focus

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.899 
like that swamp people that that focus
on<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.780> misery<00:01:49.259> of<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.470> poor<00:01:49.770> or<00:01:50.280> that<00:01:50.759> sort

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
on the misery of the poor or that sort

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.819 
on the misery of the poor or that sort
of<00:01:51.000> thing<00:01:51.060> I<00:01:51.299> do<00:01:51.479> think<00:01:51.869> that<00:01:51.930> is<00:01:52.200> causing<00:01:52.680> some

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
of thing I do think that is causing some

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.260 
of thing I do think that is causing some
harm<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.280> culture<00:01:53.579> I<00:01:53.610> do<00:01:53.700> think<00:01:54.060> that<00:01:54.090> it

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
harm to the culture I do think that it

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.480 
harm to the culture I do think that it
causes<00:01:54.570> people<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.170> look<00:01:55.590> at<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:56.040> poor<00:01:56.310> in<00:01:56.430> a

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
causes people to look at the poor in a

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.399 
causes people to look at the poor in a
particular<00:01:56.729> way<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.840> perhaps

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
particular way and and perhaps

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.380 
particular way and and perhaps
desensitize<00:01:59.250> them<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.759> how<00:01:59.880> bad<00:02:00.119> it<00:02:00.270> actually

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
desensitize them to how bad it actually

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.149 
desensitize them to how bad it actually
is<00:02:00.750> for<00:02:00.990> them<00:02:01.110> I<00:02:01.290> mean<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.740> fact<00:02:01.890> that<00:02:02.009> you

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
is for them I mean the fact that you

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.010 
is for them I mean the fact that you
take<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.340> family<00:02:02.790> like<00:02:02.939> honey<00:02:03.210> Boo<00:02:03.450> Boo's<00:02:03.479> and

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
take a family like honey Boo Boo's and

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.139 
take a family like honey Boo Boo's and
you<00:02:04.500> send<00:02:04.770> them<00:02:04.829> go<00:02:05.189> karting<00:02:05.729> or<00:02:05.850> something

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
you send them go karting or something

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.700 
you send them go karting or something
like<00:02:06.240> that<00:02:06.299> that<00:02:06.689> does<00:02:07.020> not<00:02:07.170> mean<00:02:07.439> that<00:02:07.469> the

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
like that that does not mean that the

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.219 
like that that does not mean that the
day-to-day<00:02:07.920> life<00:02:08.160> of<00:02:08.640> poor<00:02:08.910> Americans<00:02:09.509> is<00:02:09.929> any

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
day-to-day life of poor Americans is any

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.650 
day-to-day life of poor Americans is any
sort<00:02:10.619> of<00:02:10.709> carnival<00:02:11.340> okay<00:02:11.760> but<00:02:12.330> I<00:02:12.360> think<00:02:12.450> that

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
sort of carnival okay but I think that

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.830 
sort of carnival okay but I think that
by<00:02:12.870> watching<00:02:13.020> these<00:02:13.349> reality

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
by watching these reality

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.170 
by watching these reality
shows<00:02:14.019> and<00:02:14.410> having<00:02:14.739> them<00:02:14.830> be<00:02:15.010> called<00:02:15.519> reality

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
shows and having them be called reality

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.000 
shows and having them be called reality
shows<00:02:16.660> it<00:02:16.900> teaches<00:02:17.200> Americans<00:02:17.680> that<00:02:17.830> that's

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
shows it teaches Americans that that's

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.800 
shows it teaches Americans that that's
what<00:02:18.190> it's<00:02:18.489> actually<00:02:18.760> like<00:02:19.000> to<00:02:19.209> be<00:02:19.480> poor<00:02:19.720> in

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
what it's actually like to be poor in

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.630 
what it's actually like to be poor in
America<00:02:20.200> and<00:02:20.440> so<00:02:20.920> I<00:02:20.950> think<00:02:21.040> that<00:02:21.280> they<00:02:21.340> do<00:02:21.400> some

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
America and so I think that they do some

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.759 
America and so I think that they do some
damage<00:02:21.790> in<00:02:22.030> that<00:02:22.090> respect<00:02:22.540> now<00:02:22.750> look<00:02:23.349> on<00:02:23.530> duck

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
damage in that respect now look on duck

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:25.500 
damage in that respect now look on duck
dynasty<00:02:24.250> they<00:02:24.430> are<00:02:24.489> wealthy<00:02:24.970> family<00:02:25.330> they've

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
dynasty they are wealthy family they've

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.059 
dynasty they are wealthy family they've
done<00:02:25.750> well<00:02:25.900> their<00:02:26.140> entrepreneurial<00:02:26.709> and<00:02:26.950> all

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
done well their entrepreneurial and all

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:29.160 
done well their entrepreneurial and all
that<00:02:27.340> and<00:02:27.610> so<00:02:27.940> I<00:02:27.970> suppose<00:02:28.330> it<00:02:28.510> sidesteps<00:02:28.870> at<00:02:29.140> a

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
that and so I suppose it sidesteps at a

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.320 
that and so I suppose it sidesteps at a
bit<00:02:29.530> so<00:02:29.769> instead<00:02:30.160> we're<00:02:30.310> gonna<00:02:30.400> focus<00:02:30.640> on<00:02:30.970> on

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
bit so instead we're gonna focus on on

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.600 
bit so instead we're gonna focus on on
the<00:02:31.900> traditional<00:02:32.530> in<00:02:32.680> the<00:02:32.769> prayer<00:02:33.099> and<00:02:33.370> blah

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
the traditional in the prayer and blah

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.009 
the traditional in the prayer and blah
blah<00:02:33.640> blah<00:02:33.849> that<00:02:34.299> stuff<00:02:34.510> you<00:02:34.599> heard<00:02:34.780> Laura

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
blah blah that stuff you heard Laura

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:37.500 
blah blah that stuff you heard Laura
Ingraham<00:02:35.319> saying<00:02:35.819> so<00:02:36.819> whether<00:02:37.090> or<00:02:37.239> not<00:02:37.330> she

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
Ingraham saying so whether or not she

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.550 
Ingraham saying so whether or not she
actually<00:02:37.660> watches<00:02:38.230> it<00:02:38.379> uh<00:02:38.830> I<00:02:39.069> understand<00:02:39.819> that

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
actually watches it uh I understand that

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.170 
actually watches it uh I understand that
there's<00:02:41.560> not<00:02:41.739> a<00:02:41.799> lot<00:02:42.010> of<00:02:42.040> overtly<00:02:42.580> religious

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
there's not a lot of overtly religious

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.030 
there's not a lot of overtly religious
programming<00:02:43.629> I<00:02:43.900> suppose<00:02:44.260> and<00:02:44.680> so<00:02:44.799> if<00:02:44.920> you're

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
programming I suppose and so if you're

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.890 
programming I suppose and so if you're
religious<00:02:45.459> you<00:02:45.760> are<00:02:45.940> probably<00:02:46.209> going<00:02:46.599> to<00:02:46.750> like

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
religious you are probably going to like

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.020 
religious you are probably going to like
this<00:02:47.079> sort<00:02:47.319> of<00:02:47.380> thing<00:02:47.440> and<00:02:47.890> yet<00:02:48.519> for<00:02:48.549> me<00:02:48.910> it

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
this sort of thing and yet for me it

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.000 
this sort of thing and yet for me it
triggers<00:02:49.450> some<00:02:49.750> warning<00:02:50.049> signs<00:02:50.260> Laura

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
triggers some warning signs Laura

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.800 
triggers some warning signs Laura
Ingraham<00:02:51.489> is<00:02:51.610> saying<00:02:51.849> that<00:02:51.910> simply<00:02:52.390> because

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
Ingraham is saying that simply because

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.140 
Ingraham is saying that simply because
they<00:02:53.140> pray<00:02:53.650> and<00:02:54.069> they're<00:02:54.220> not<00:02:54.370> all<00:02:54.640> screwing

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150

each other on screen this is something

that we should lawd but I don't know if

that we should lawd but I don't know if
that's<00:02:58.810> necessarily<00:02:58.930> the<00:02:59.410> case<00:02:59.650> I<00:02:59.920> mean<00:03:00.099> have

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
that's necessarily the case I mean have

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.130 
that's necessarily the case I mean have
you<00:03:00.549> followed<00:03:01.030> some<00:03:01.209> of<00:03:01.329> these<00:03:01.420> reality<00:03:01.930> show

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
you followed some of these reality show

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.690 
you followed some of these reality show
families<00:03:02.709> and<00:03:02.980> what's<00:03:03.099> happened<00:03:03.489> to<00:03:03.610> them

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
families and what's happened to them

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.729 
families and what's happened to them
long-term<00:03:04.000> after<00:03:04.629> their<00:03:04.810> their<00:03:04.989> rise<00:03:05.500> to

long-term after their their rise to
stardom<00:03:05.950> if<00:03:06.489> anything<00:03:07.000> I<00:03:07.299> I<00:03:07.480> want<00:03:07.900> to<00:03:07.959> cover

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079 
stardom if anything I I want to cover

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:09.449 
stardom if anything I I want to cover
this<00:03:08.260> just<00:03:08.500> that<00:03:08.650> you<00:03:08.739> can<00:03:08.860> look<00:03:09.010> back<00:03:09.190> in<00:03:09.400> a

this just that you can look back in a

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.280 
this just that you can look back in a
few<00:03:09.640> years<00:03:09.790> after<00:03:09.970> this<00:03:10.150> family<00:03:10.569> starts<00:03:10.840> suing

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
few years after this family starts suing

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.380 
few years after this family starts suing
each<00:03:11.440> other<00:03:11.680> and<00:03:12.010> and<00:03:12.280> one<00:03:12.790> of<00:03:12.879> the<00:03:13.000> murders

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
each other and and one of the murders

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.059 
each other and and one of the murders
the<00:03:13.599> other<00:03:13.750> then<00:03:14.319> we'll<00:03:14.500> look<00:03:14.620> back<00:03:14.799> and<00:03:14.860> think

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
the other then we'll look back and think

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:17.009 
the other then we'll look back and think
maybe<00:03:15.430> praying<00:03:15.790> wasn't<00:03:15.970> enough<00:03:16.390> and<00:03:16.660> and

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
maybe praying wasn't enough and and

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.199 
maybe praying wasn't enough and and
that's<00:03:17.440> really<00:03:17.650> the<00:03:17.829> problem<00:03:18.040> that<00:03:18.310> I<00:03:18.340> have<00:03:18.639> uh

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
that's really the problem that I have uh

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.960 
that's really the problem that I have uh
I<00:03:19.750> don't<00:03:19.930> think<00:03:20.200> that<00:03:20.620> in<00:03:20.859> general<00:03:20.920> terms<00:03:21.700> is

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
I don't think that in general terms is

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.490 
I don't think that in general terms is
anything<00:03:22.239> wrong<00:03:22.480> with<00:03:22.540> the<00:03:22.870> family<00:03:23.230> praying

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
anything wrong with the family praying

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.440 
anything wrong with the family praying
if<00:03:23.739> it<00:03:24.100> makes<00:03:24.310> you<00:03:24.519> feel<00:03:24.790> better<00:03:24.850> if<00:03:25.180> it<00:03:25.299> brings

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
if it makes you feel better if it brings

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.479 
if it makes you feel better if it brings
you<00:03:25.600> together<00:03:25.840> feel<00:03:26.230> free<00:03:26.380> to<00:03:26.470> do<00:03:26.620> that<00:03:26.650> but

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
you together feel free to do that but

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:29.129 
you together feel free to do that but
she<00:03:27.760> seems<00:03:28.090> to<00:03:28.269> think<00:03:28.299> that<00:03:28.510> simply<00:03:28.989> because

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:29.139 
she seems to think that simply because

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:32.309 
she seems to think that simply because
this<00:03:29.650> family<00:03:30.069> prays<00:03:30.430> they<00:03:31.209> are<00:03:31.480> traditional

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 
this family prays they are traditional

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:33.839 
this family prays they are traditional
and<00:03:32.470> they<00:03:32.560> are<00:03:32.709> moral<00:03:33.220> and<00:03:33.370> we<00:03:33.459> should<00:03:33.639> see

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:33.849 
and they are moral and we should see

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:36.360 
and they are moral and we should see
more<00:03:34.090> of<00:03:34.239> them<00:03:34.420> they<00:03:35.290> can<00:03:35.470> be<00:03:35.590> doing<00:03:35.829> all<00:03:35.980> sorts

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
more of them they can be doing all sorts

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:37.979 
more of them they can be doing all sorts
of<00:03:36.459> horrible<00:03:36.910> things<00:03:37.060> day<00:03:37.480> to<00:03:37.540> day<00:03:37.720> to<00:03:37.780> each

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
of horrible things day to day to each

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:39.990 
of horrible things day to day to each
other<00:03:38.260> praying<00:03:38.920> doesn't<00:03:39.280> change<00:03:39.549> that<00:03:39.819> in

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
other praying doesn't change that in

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.640 
other praying doesn't change that in
many<00:03:40.209> instances<00:03:40.660> praying<00:03:41.109> is<00:03:41.260> just<00:03:41.440> a<00:03:41.530> way<00:03:41.620> to

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
many instances praying is just a way to

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.020 
many instances praying is just a way to
feel<00:03:41.920> better<00:03:42.190> without<00:03:42.370> actually<00:03:42.790> having<00:03:42.880> to

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
feel better without actually having to

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.089 
feel better without actually having to
do<00:03:43.329> anything<00:03:43.599> and<00:03:43.989> so<00:03:44.560> I<00:03:44.590> think<00:03:44.709> that<00:03:44.980> it's

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:45.099 
do anything and so I think that it's

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:46.530 
do anything and so I think that it's
it's<00:03:45.340> particularly<00:03:45.669> naive<00:03:46.209> of<00:03:46.329> Laura

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
it's particularly naive of Laura

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.210 
it's particularly naive of Laura
Ingraham<00:03:46.840> in<00:03:46.959> this<00:03:47.079> case<00:03:47.319> to<00:03:47.590> to<00:03:47.769> laud<00:03:47.980> this

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
Ingraham in this case to to laud this

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.860 
Ingraham in this case to to laud this
family<00:03:48.579> simply<00:03:48.880> because<00:03:49.269> they<00:03:49.389> pray<00:03:49.690> at<00:03:49.840> the

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
family simply because they pray at the

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.259 
family simply because they pray at the
end<00:03:50.049> of<00:03:50.079> every<00:03:50.769> program<00:03:51.190> and<00:03:51.370> by<00:03:51.940> the<00:03:52.000> way<00:03:52.150> the

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
end of every program and by the way the

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:53.729 
end of every program and by the way the
fact<00:03:52.510> that<00:03:52.569> they<00:03:52.750> pray<00:03:52.959> at<00:03:53.049> the<00:03:53.139> end<00:03:53.319> of<00:03:53.500> every

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
fact that they pray at the end of every

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:55.289 
fact that they pray at the end of every
episode<00:03:53.769> seems<00:03:54.400> to<00:03:54.549> imply<00:03:54.639> to<00:03:54.819> me<00:03:55.060> that<00:03:55.209> it's

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
episode seems to imply to me that it's

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:57.390 
episode seems to imply to me that it's
much<00:03:55.480> less<00:03:55.780> about<00:03:56.139> communing<00:03:57.010> with<00:03:57.040> some

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
much less about communing with some

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.520 
much less about communing with some

higher being and more to do with

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
the top 1% there a lot of things that

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:21.950 
the top 1% there a lot of things that
are<00:05:20.460> putting<00:05:20.640> incredible<00:05:21.360> strain<00:05:21.660> both

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
are putting incredible strain both

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.690 
are putting incredible strain both

economically and psychologically on
American<00:05:24.090> families<00:05:24.510> and<00:05:24.660> I<00:05:24.690> don't<00:05:24.900> think<00:05:25.080> that

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:25.230 
American families and I don't think that

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:27.140 
American families and I don't think that
it's<00:05:25.410> a<00:05:25.500> lack<00:05:25.680> of<00:05:25.710> Prayer<00:05:26.130> fundamentally<00:05:26.850> and

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
it's a lack of Prayer fundamentally and

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:28.820 
it's a lack of Prayer fundamentally and
so<00:05:27.510> it's<00:05:27.630> very<00:05:27.780> convenient<00:05:28.290> for<00:05:28.680> laura

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830 
so it's very convenient for laura

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.320 
so it's very convenient for laura
ingraham<00:05:29.160> in<00:05:29.280> this<00:05:29.370> case<00:05:29.580> to<00:05:29.760> focus<00:05:30.120> on<00:05:30.270> the

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330 
ingraham in this case to focus on the

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.030 
ingraham in this case to focus on the
prayer<00:05:30.540> element<00:05:30.990> because<00:05:31.530> the<00:05:31.680> sorts<00:05:31.950> of

solutions these problems that we

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:34.910 
solutions these problems that we
actually<00:05:33.840> need<00:05:34.020> like<00:05:34.260> stimulating<00:05:34.860> the
