diving<00:01:15.830> oftentimes<00:01:16.830> there<00:01:17.070> is<00:01:17.189> current<00:01:17.549> so

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
diving oftentimes there is current so

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.880 
diving oftentimes there is current so
you<00:01:18.330> need<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.659> be<00:01:18.689> comfortable<00:01:19.049> with<00:01:19.409> diving

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
you need to be comfortable with diving

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.330 
you need to be comfortable with diving
in<00:01:20.850> current<00:01:21.299> or<00:01:21.540> on<00:01:21.810> drip<00:01:22.110> dives<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.890> also

the<00:01:27.030> Galapagos<00:01:27.600> are<00:01:27.750> in<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.619> unique<00:01:28.650> position

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
the Galapagos are in a unique position

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.760 
the Galapagos are in a unique position
there<00:01:30.030> are<00:01:30.299> three<00:01:30.780> different<00:01:30.990> currents<00:01:31.560> that

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
there are three different currents that

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.550 
there are three different currents that
converge<00:01:32.579> right<00:01:33.570> where<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.020> islands<00:01:34.380> are

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
converge right where the islands are

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.310 
converge right where the islands are
located<00:01:35.070> so<00:01:35.700> this<00:01:35.880> brings<00:01:36.060> your<00:01:36.390> cold<00:01:36.720> water

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
located so this brings your cold water

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.010 
located so this brings your cold water
from<00:01:37.950> Antarctica<00:01:38.670> via<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.420> Humboldt<00:01:39.869> Current

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
from Antarctica via the Humboldt Current

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.130 
from Antarctica via the Humboldt Current
you've<00:01:40.470> got<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:41.240> equatorial<00:01:42.240> current<00:01:42.720> coming

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
you've got the equatorial current coming

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.600 
you've got the equatorial current coming
in<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.470> you've<00:01:43.560> also<00:01:43.740> got<00:01:44.040> another<00:01:44.250> current

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
in and you've also got another current

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.910 
in and you've also got another current
coming<00:01:44.790> in<00:01:45.030> from<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.270> north<00:01:45.540> so<00:01:46.170> when<00:01:46.710> these

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
coming in from the north so when these

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.609 
coming in from the north so when these
currents<00:01:47.549> clash<00:01:47.990> they<00:01:48.990> bring<00:01:49.290> all<00:01:49.470> this

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
currents clash they bring all this

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.950 
currents clash they bring all this
nutrient<00:01:50.159> which<00:01:50.340> water<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.390> Galapagos

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
nutrient which water to the Galapagos

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.469 
nutrient which water to the Galapagos
Islands<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.490> of<00:01:53.490> course<00:01:53.549> if<00:01:54.000> you've<00:01:54.149> got<00:01:54.299> lots

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
Islands and of course if you've got lots

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.510 
Islands and of course if you've got lots
of<00:01:54.630> nutrients<00:01:55.049> that<00:01:55.229> starts<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.040> food<00:01:56.219> chain

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
of nutrients that starts the food chain

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.789 
of nutrients that starts the food chain
and<00:01:57.090> at<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.420> top<00:01:57.630> of<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.840> food<00:01:58.020> chain<00:01:58.079> are<00:01:58.560> the

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
and at the top of the food chain are the

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.370 
and at the top of the food chain are the
big<00:01:58.950> predators<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.729> the<00:02:00.060> big

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
the feeders like the whales and whale

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:06.340 
the feeders like the whales and whale
sharks<00:02:03.259> they<00:02:04.070> are<00:02:04.219> certainly<00:02:04.579> a<00:02:05.180> hundred<00:02:06.140> in

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
sharks they are certainly a hundred in

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.719 
sharks they are certainly a hundred in
certain<00:02:06.740> parts<00:02:07.009> of<00:02:07.070> the<00:02:07.130> world<00:02:07.390> Mexico<00:02:08.390> in

certain parts of the world Mexico in
Australia<00:02:10.729> and<00:02:10.970> I<00:02:11.780> believe<00:02:12.080> in<00:02:12.260> South<00:02:12.440> Africa

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
Australia and I believe in South Africa

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.790 
Australia and I believe in South Africa
they<00:02:13.099> are<00:02:13.280> protected<00:02:13.819> however<00:02:14.349> like<00:02:15.349> a<00:02:15.380> lot<00:02:15.680> of

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
they are protected however like a lot of

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.720 
they are protected however like a lot of
these<00:02:15.890> sharks<00:02:16.760> they<00:02:17.090> migrate<00:02:17.870> transoceanic

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
these sharks they migrate transoceanic

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.550 
these sharks they migrate transoceanic
so<00:02:19.730> we<00:02:20.030> protect<00:02:20.420> them<00:02:20.540> in<00:02:20.630> one<00:02:20.840> place<00:02:21.110> and<00:02:21.410> not

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
so we protect them in one place and not

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.259 
so we protect them in one place and not
another<00:02:21.890> that's<00:02:22.430> really<00:02:22.640> not<00:02:22.819> enough<00:02:23.120> they

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
another that's really not enough they

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:24.910 
another that's really not enough they
need<00:02:23.420> to<00:02:23.510> be<00:02:23.989> protected<00:02:24.200> throughout<00:02:24.709> their

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
need to be protected throughout their

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.370 
need to be protected throughout their
whole<00:02:25.069> migratory<00:02:25.610> range<00:02:25.849> the<00:02:26.510> whale<00:02:27.050> sharks

simply<00:02:29.840> because<00:02:30.170> at<00:02:30.950> this<00:02:31.160> time<00:02:31.400> we<00:02:31.640> don't

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
simply because at this time we don't

our<00:03:31.670> house<00:03:32.530> if<00:03:33.530> you<00:03:33.620> do<00:03:33.740> get<00:03:33.890> a<00:03:33.950> sense<00:03:34.460> of<00:03:34.640> what

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
our house if you do get a sense of what

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.070 
our house if you do get a sense of what
it<00:03:34.910> was<00:03:35.030> like<00:03:35.180> when<00:03:35.480> the<00:03:35.630> early<00:03:35.870> explorers

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 
it was like when the early explorers

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.800 
it was like when the early explorers
showed<00:03:36.530> up<00:03:36.710> at<00:03:36.830> the<00:03:36.920> Galapagos<00:03:37.460> because<00:03:37.910> these

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
showed up at the Galapagos because these

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.590 
showed up at the Galapagos because these
islands<00:03:39.290> are<00:03:39.380> so<00:03:39.590> remote<00:03:40.070> for<00:03:40.460> 600<00:03:41.000> miles<00:03:41.210> from

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
islands are so remote for 600 miles from

islands are so remote for 600 miles from

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
the mainland of South America so these

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.950 
the mainland of South America so these
animals<00:03:46.670> evolved<00:03:47.150> over<00:03:47.240> a<00:03:47.450> long<00:03:47.600> period<00:03:47.630> of

animals evolved over a long period of

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.590 
animals evolved over a long period of
time<00:03:48.020> on<00:03:48.530> each<00:03:49.310> individual<00:03:49.910> island<00:03:50.420> as<00:03:50.540> a

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600 
time on each individual island as a

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
each one of these different islands they

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.570 
each one of these different islands they
developed<00:03:55.760> and<00:03:55.940> slightly<00:03:56.300> different<00:03:56.750> fairway
