00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:23.109
 found in a state of chemical-induced hibernation 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:28.829

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:35.199

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.280
 but as I said at the beginning before putting a comment, watch the video 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.110

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.990
