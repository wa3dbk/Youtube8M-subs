00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.060 
bigger allen wrench and actually then
the<00:02:00.299> stock<00:02:00.600> ones<00:02:00.840> are<00:02:00.990> no<00:02:01.079> cut<00:02:01.350> joints<00:02:01.770> on<00:02:01.890> and

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
the stock ones are no cut joints on and

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.510 
the stock ones are no cut joints on and
they're<00:02:02.189> just

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
they're just

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.459 
they're just
screws<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:03.450> these<00:02:03.570> that<00:02:03.719> I<00:02:03.780> have<00:02:03.930> mines<00:02:04.170> loose

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
screws and these that I have mines loose

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:11.960 
screws and these that I have mines loose
actually<00:02:05.450> so<00:02:08.060> so<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:10.129> this<00:02:11.129> can<00:02:11.459> move<00:02:11.730> back

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
actually so so that this can move back

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.420 
actually so so that this can move back
and<00:02:12.030> forth<00:02:12.450> I<00:02:12.980> don't<00:02:13.980> know<00:02:14.069> if<00:02:14.160> you<00:02:14.220> can<00:02:14.310> really

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
and forth I don't know if you can really

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.920 
and forth I don't know if you can really
see<00:02:14.700> it<00:02:14.819> but<00:02:14.849> they<00:02:15.000> move<00:02:15.209> back<00:02:15.360> and<00:02:15.480> forth<00:02:15.690> side

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
see it but they move back and forth side

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.780 
see it but they move back and forth side
to<00:02:15.959> side<00:02:16.230> or<00:02:16.290> whatever<00:02:16.709> so<00:02:17.340> pretty<00:02:17.610> much

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
to side or whatever so pretty much

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.420 
to side or whatever so pretty much
there's<00:02:18.060> a<00:02:18.150> new<00:02:18.269> DP<00:02:18.750> chassis<00:02:19.319> on<00:02:19.470> there<00:02:19.769> they

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
there's a new DP chassis on there they

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.360 
there's a new DP chassis on there they
got<00:02:20.640> some<00:02:20.670> pretty<00:02:21.150> nice<00:02:21.330> flex<00:02:21.720> a<00:02:22.370> suspension

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
got some pretty nice flex a suspension

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.830 
got some pretty nice flex a suspension
to<00:02:23.640> it<00:02:23.790> even<00:02:23.970> though<00:02:24.120> there's<00:02:24.360> no<00:02:24.510> structure

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
to it even though there's no structure

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.479 
to it even though there's no structure
shrink<00:02:25.260> its<00:02:25.410> still<00:02:25.620> bouncing<00:02:26.069> you<00:02:26.129> see<00:02:26.310> that

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
shrink its still bouncing you see that

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:39.460 
shrink its still bouncing you see that
and<00:02:26.730> it<00:02:27.360> gets<00:02:27.510> really<00:02:27.750> nice<00:02:29.870> flex<00:02:30.870> to<00:02:31.170> it

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:45.220 

as<00:02:39.980> you<00:02:40.220> can<00:02:40.340> see<00:02:40.630> so<00:02:41.680> anyway<00:02:43.810> there's<00:02:44.810> the<00:02:45.080> new

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
crawler the new DP chassis I just use

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.660 
crawler the new DP chassis I just use
the<00:02:51.740> stock<00:02:52.780> screws<00:02:53.780> on<00:02:54.110> there<00:02:54.380> to<00:02:55.370> put<00:02:55.550> the

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
the stock screws on there to put the

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.390 
the stock screws on there to put the
chassis<00:02:56.090> back<00:02:56.300> to<00:02:56.510> get<00:02:56.690> there<00:02:56.930> and<00:02:57.400> that's

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
chassis back to get there and that's

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.370 
chassis back to get there and that's
pretty<00:02:58.610> much<00:02:58.730> it<00:02:58.910> I'll<00:02:59.270> be<00:02:59.660> showing<00:02:59.870> you<00:03:00.110> guys
