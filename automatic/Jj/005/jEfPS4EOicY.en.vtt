00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
break that is the paramilitary - I'm

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.120 
break that is the paramilitary - I'm
sure<00:01:13.170> most<00:01:14.100> people<00:01:14.520> know<00:01:14.670> this<00:01:14.880> knife<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:16.130> opted

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
sure most people know this knife I opted

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.530 
sure most people know this knife I opted
for<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:18.350> blackened<00:01:19.350> blade<00:01:20.009> version<00:01:20.820> just

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
for the blackened blade version just

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.090 
for the blackened blade version just
because<00:01:21.840> it's<00:01:21.990> more<00:01:22.170> inconspicuous<00:01:22.530> I<00:01:22.979> do

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
because it's more inconspicuous I do

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.719 
because it's more inconspicuous I do
think<00:01:23.549> that<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.909> satin<00:01:24.270> finish<00:01:25.250> blade<00:01:26.250> looks

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
think that the satin finish blade looks

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.170 
think that the satin finish blade looks
better<00:01:28.280> but<00:01:29.280> this<00:01:29.549> one<00:01:29.759> is<00:01:30.000> just<00:01:30.390> like<00:01:30.780> I<00:01:31.110> said

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
better but this one is just like I said

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:39.230 
better but this one is just like I said
more<00:01:33.180> inconspicuous<00:01:34.310> I<00:01:35.720> like<00:01:36.720> us<00:01:36.900> 30b<00:01:38.210> holds<00:01:39.210> a

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
more inconspicuous I like us 30b holds a

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.679 
more inconspicuous I like us 30b holds a

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.670 
the only thing I will have to change is

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:29.070 
the only thing I will have to change is
there's<00:04:27.670> a<00:04:27.760> saber<00:04:27.970> grind<00:04:28.120> and<00:04:28.540> has<00:04:28.690> a<00:04:28.720> very

there's a saber grind and has a very
steep<00:04:29.820> convex<00:04:31.020> secondary<00:04:32.020> bevel<00:04:32.890> it<00:04:33.400> shaves

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
steep convex secondary bevel it shaves

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.890 
steep convex secondary bevel it shaves
it's<00:04:34.930> razor<00:04:35.320> sharp<00:04:35.710> but<00:04:36.400> it<00:04:36.730> it's<00:04:37.600> not<00:04:37.750> a<00:04:37.810> good

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
it's razor sharp but it it's not a good

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:43.110 
it's razor sharp but it it's not a good
performer<00:04:38.500> so<00:04:39.300> also<00:04:40.470> lacking<00:04:41.470> a<00:04:41.560> handle<00:04:42.120> it's

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
performer so also lacking a handle it's

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.730 
performer so also lacking a handle it's
going<00:04:43.300> to<00:04:43.360> be<00:04:43.480> very<00:04:43.720> difficult<00:04:43.960> for<00:04:44.350> you<00:04:44.590> to

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
going to be very difficult for you to
