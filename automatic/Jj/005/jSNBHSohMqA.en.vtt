00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.170
 Good day, our tankers 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.420
 is broadcasting fake battleship for you today 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.280
 sometimes agree with most of 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.529
 there are moments when you meet 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.449
 have no idea how to 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.160
 against him fight in the loop of these videos 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.820
 we will try to fix it and so 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.820
 go 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.550
 So let's proceed directly to conti. 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.500
 today's guide to our customers 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.559
 becoming an American premium tank 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.730
 level eight super pershing 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:43.670
 We will consider mainly the forehead 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.350
 for in the rest of the punk armor is not 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.080
 randomly very common people 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.280
 who don't know how to punch him 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.530
 the only place in which most often 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.410
 try to pierce the peach is lichke on 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.930
 the tower is undoubtedly a vulnerable spot 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.910
 this tank however if it controls 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.680
 experienced tankman then he is tanking 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.200
 raises the mask up thereby 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.180
 complicates targeting mask by the way 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.149
 speaking very hard for example take 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:11.869
 object 704 and try to break through this very 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:13.850
 mask do three shots and naturally 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:16.009
 impenetrable so what to do in such 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.380
 case of superpershing actually 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:20.509
 There is much more than 1 vulnerable. 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.250
 for example, when the mask is fully raised 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:24.229
 super peppers are clearly visible 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.110
 the counters on the tower which are also 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.190
 make their way without problems to a nickname further 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.890
 consider vld 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.420
 and nld if you break below 200 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.189
 millimeters shoot there generally not 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.439
 worth it as with a large share 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:38.150
 probabilities you just won't knock in 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:40.700
 other cases, for example, on IS-3 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:44.900
 or on t-34 that which is american 8 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.850
 level nld make their way to the departure now 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.009
 consider in detail this as usual on 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.409
 this tank try sorry for 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.450
 Tautology tank certainly puts 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:55.310
 rhombus what I do not advise at all 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.110
 because if this tank is a little bit 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.970
 turn the case then we open 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.740
 absolutely beautiful view 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.350
 defenseless board which makes its way 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.060
 in almost any projects to clinch with 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.470
 super pershing is better not to get 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.780
 if your tank is lower 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.739
 so in any case it will punch 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.459
 much harder 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:15.890
 levan t-34 q-5 on the contrary it is better to keep 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:19.420
 to rush as close as possible as the roof 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.420
 her towers are cardboard 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:25.320
 to fight against such a tank Niall tonnes 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.510
 It should also be as against the cords, that is 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.680
 try to twist by the way it turns out 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.870
 pretty often 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:35.730
 Persh does not have much agility 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:38.070
 you summarize super pes it rather 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.870
 ted with armor rather than t and fight 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.000
 against him should be appropriate 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.400
 I hope this information will help you in battle 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.680
 do not forget to do what you usually have 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.060
 asked to do at the end of the video namely 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.350
 run on the authors' channels 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.660
 subscribe to wot-fan 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.890
 and do not skimp on likes and broadcast for you 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.890
 on blades and all bye
