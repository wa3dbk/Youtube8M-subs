actually<00:03:08.739> sent<00:03:08.920> us<00:03:09.010> a<00:03:09.130> car<00:03:09.340> with<00:03:10.060> a<00:03:10.090> manual

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
actually sent us a car with a manual

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.360 
actually sent us a car with a manual
gearbox<00:03:10.570> because<00:03:11.260> well<00:03:11.590> the<00:03:11.709> 6-speed<00:03:12.340> manual

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
gearbox because well the 6-speed manual

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.330 
gearbox because well the 6-speed manual
is<00:03:12.820> okay<00:03:13.420> I<00:03:13.630> finally<00:03:14.290> the<00:03:14.560> action<00:03:14.830> a<00:03:14.920> little

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
is okay I finally the action a little

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.820 
is okay I finally the action a little
bit<00:03:15.519> springy<00:03:15.910> and<00:03:16.239> the<00:03:16.690> pedals<00:03:17.080> are<00:03:17.290> offset

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
bit springy and the pedals are offset

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.220 
bit springy and the pedals are offset
and<00:03:18.070> anyway<00:03:18.730> this<00:03:19.090> car<00:03:19.390> is<00:03:19.540> so<00:03:19.810> much<00:03:19.840> better

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
and anyway this car is so much better

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.520 
and anyway this car is so much better

once again and in this time it's going

rooms<00:03:55.709> D<00:03:55.890> CERN<00:03:56.190> lots<00:03:56.760> of<00:03:56.880> new<00:03:57.060> room<00:03:57.300> as<00:03:57.450> well

rooms D CERN lots of new room as well
but<00:03:58.140> overall<00:03:58.440> I<00:03:58.530> don't<00:03:58.709> think<00:03:58.830> it's<00:03:58.950> quite<00:03:59.160> as

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
but overall I don't think it's quite as

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.100 
but overall I don't think it's quite as
comfortable<00:03:59.850> in<00:04:00.030> the<00:04:00.120> back<00:04:00.270> here<00:04:00.510> as<00:04:00.690> it<00:04:00.810> is<00:04:00.930> in

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
comfortable in the back here as it is in

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.140 
comfortable in the back here as it is in
a<00:04:01.170> Mercedes<00:04:01.470> e-class<00:04:01.920> and<00:04:02.520> so<00:04:02.640> that's<00:04:03.000> gonna

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
a Mercedes e-class and so that's gonna

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.940 
a Mercedes e-class and so that's gonna
be<00:04:03.239> ever<00:04:03.390> so<00:04:03.540> slightly<00:04:03.750> better<00:04:03.989> for<00:04:04.530> carrying

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
be ever so slightly better for carrying

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.740 
be ever so slightly better for carrying
passengers<00:04:05.160> regularly<00:04:05.940> also<00:04:06.330> you've<00:04:06.660> got

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
passengers regularly also you've got

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.509 
passengers regularly also you've got
large<00:04:07.110> transmission<00:04:07.590> tunnel<00:04:07.980> which<00:04:08.250> does

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
large transmission tunnel which does

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:10.880 
large transmission tunnel which does
reduce<00:04:09.030> the<00:04:09.390> usefulness<00:04:09.840> of<00:04:10.200> this<00:04:10.709> middle

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
reduce the usefulness of this middle

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.220 
reduce the usefulness of this middle
seat<00:04:11.280> but<00:04:11.519> that's<00:04:12.269> a<00:04:12.390> problem<00:04:12.540> on<00:04:12.930> all<00:04:13.080> these

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230
