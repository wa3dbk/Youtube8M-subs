00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.250
 hello everybody it's me again and 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.800
 today little video for you 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.599
 pass some small information 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.519
 so already at first when she 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:34.510
 see the background has changed a little bit 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:37.630
 a quick tour of the owner quickly 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.520
 here it is a little bit a little bit 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.350
 different here we are in a first 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.710
 time 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:48.399
 move change change 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.399
 only from office etc 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.710
 second little thing you can 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.000
 see it I'm currently recording it 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:01.159
 a lot less small headphones pickups 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:04.640
 to the con that I had decided to ban 

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:05.810
 finally down my set up because 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.220
 that it was completely crap 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.820
 you want to hear this resource that 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:14.630
 is sizzling behind what I'm saying 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:18.590
 and it's very annoying by force it's 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:22.090
 why I bought them to 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:24.920
 supermicro 120 rubles getty etc 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.930
 used by not many youtube 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.710
 hours 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.000
 so why do not I use 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.840
 currently for the simple and good 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.110
 reason I do not understand why 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:39.520
 I have a problem since my move 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:42.370
 impossible to make it work then 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.460
 I plug him a microphone that plugs 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:48.820
 in usb and as soon as I branch it did 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:52.450
 finally on the usb socket 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:55.590
 he connects while all 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:02:01.030
 drivers the drivers are updated etc 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:02.830
 it disconnects automatically as soon as 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.600
 that he is caught in fact he is 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.130
 disconnects he reconnects himself and 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.209
 disconnect it reconnects all the 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.800
 3 seconds and so is impossible to in 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.120
 shoot whether I looked on 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.800
 forums they said yes you have to change 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.120
 the usb cable 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.680
 I do not know if it's true because we have 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.860
 others say Banon will change anything 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.600
 so I do not really know what I need 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.980
 make 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.420
 I have no guarantee to send g 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.530
 that slab so I do not know how 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:32.230
 we must proceed 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.350
 So here is a waiting I'll 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.739
 work with this little mic at the con 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.100
 Too bad 1 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:40.989
 how can we say we can not have everything because 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.519
 that before I have fiber so a good 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:46.239
 new is that I must have 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:49.290
 fiber so more more videos 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:54.730
 more stacks of content and especially 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:56.530
 third thing to announce you the beginning 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.040
 live so I've already done a live there 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.230
 tonight 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.000
 my very first live one was a 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.910
 decade 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.819
 participate in live so it's very 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.500
 living the people who were there knew 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:10.700
 ask questions and these hikes 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.530
 were nice enough we did a 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.840
 little bit to see their coach on the 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.180
 beta I spent an hour trying to 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:21.080
 do a hubert instance is by the way 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:25.400
 and it was pretty cool so that's it 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:28.160
 I will have the link of my chain 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.980
 twitch on under in the description of 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.590
 this video do not hesitate so went see 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.630
 the twitch chain to subscribe to the 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.310
 quick chain to know when is this 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.040
 I will live because I 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.799
 would be very very active on my channel 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:46.100
 twitch destrem quite often because 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:48.380
 I love it and and that's it if you 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.330

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.890
 small outings on official wii 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:56.260
 to make dungeon choices from 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:58.850
 scenarios of the raids 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:02.510
 That's it could be nice of 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:05.570
 do it under stream between us 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:08.840
 could really be very fun 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:12.190
 so here I am I will put an end to this 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.720
