00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:21.910 
tues campaign now the locusts are back

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.150 
tues campaign now the locusts are back
and<00:00:22.150> they're<00:00:22.689> meaner<00:00:22.930> than<00:00:23.020> ever<00:00:23.320> and<00:00:23.619> they've

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:24.160 
and they're meaner than ever and they've

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.380 
and they're meaner than ever and they've
brought<00:00:24.399> with<00:00:24.550> them<00:00:24.579> a<00:00:24.730> force<00:00:25.000> that<00:00:25.060> can

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:25.390 
brought with them a force that can

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.210 
brought with them a force that can
essentially<00:00:25.720> sink<00:00:26.140> entire<00:00:26.560> cities<00:00:26.829> and<00:00:27.130> it's

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:27.220 
essentially sink entire cities and it's

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.190 
essentially sink entire cities and it's
not<00:00:27.369> just<00:00:27.849> a<00:00:28.000> little<00:00:28.210> emergence<00:00:28.630> hole<00:00:28.840> it's<00:00:29.079> an

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:29.200 
not just a little emergence hole it's an

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.200 
not just a little emergence hole it's an
entire<00:00:29.470> city<00:00:29.770> going<00:00:29.980> down<00:00:30.220> at<00:00:30.369> once<00:00:30.579> so

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.210 
entire city going down at once so

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.240 
entire city going down at once so
humanity's<00:00:31.750> back<00:00:31.989> is<00:00:32.169> against<00:00:32.500> the<00:00:32.529> wall<00:00:32.619> and

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.250 
humanity's back is against the wall and

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.590 
humanity's back is against the wall and
we<00:00:33.370> need<00:00:33.489> to<00:00:33.550> strike<00:00:33.880> back<00:00:34.090> against<00:00:34.510> these

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:34.600 
we need to strike back against these

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.780 
we need to strike back against these
guys<00:00:34.809> so<00:00:35.530> the<00:00:35.649> way<00:00:35.800> that<00:00:35.829> we<00:00:36.040> do<00:00:36.219> that<00:00:36.250> is<00:00:36.640> by

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:36.790 
guys so the way that we do that is by

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:38.610 
guys so the way that we do that is by
taking<00:00:36.969> these<00:00:37.210> trucks<00:00:37.570> called<00:00:38.020> Derrick's<00:00:38.380> and

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:38.620 
taking these trucks called Derrick's and

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.439 
taking these trucks called Derrick's and
we<00:00:38.739> tow<00:00:38.980> these<00:00:39.160> devices<00:00:39.489> called<00:00:39.790> grind<00:00:40.149> lifts

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:40.449 
we tow these devices called grind lifts

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:43.439 
we tow these devices called grind lifts
into<00:00:40.539> locust<00:00:40.960> occupied<00:00:41.350> cities<00:00:41.769> the<00:00:42.460> COG<00:00:43.179> guys

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:43.449 
into locust occupied cities the COG guys

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:45.360 
into locust occupied cities the COG guys
get<00:00:43.690> in<00:00:43.870> the<00:00:43.989> grind<00:00:44.199> lifts<00:00:44.500> they<00:00:44.620> barrel<00:00:45.190> down

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 
get in the grind lifts they barrel down

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.040 
get in the grind lifts they barrel down
to<00:00:45.699> depths<00:00:45.999> of<00:00:45.999> the<00:00:46.179> underground<00:00:46.629> and<00:00:46.899> they

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.050 
to depths of the underground and they

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.410 
to depths of the underground and they
fight<00:00:47.320> back<00:00:47.530> against<00:00:47.859> these<00:00:48.039> bad<00:00:48.219> guys<00:00:48.249> so<00:00:49.239> the
