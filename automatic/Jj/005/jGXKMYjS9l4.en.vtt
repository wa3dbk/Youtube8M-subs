00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
plastic reinforcements in the edges so

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.890 
plastic reinforcements in the edges so
it<00:03:19.480> won't<00:03:19.690> just<00:03:21.120> collapse<00:03:22.120> in<00:03:22.360> and<00:03:22.540> fall<00:03:22.720> on

leak<00:03:25.570> the<00:03:26.410> only<00:03:26.560> problem<00:03:26.890> is<00:03:26.980> is<00:03:27.250> if<00:03:27.430> you<00:03:27.580> get

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
leak the only problem is is if you get

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.810 
leak the only problem is is if you get
your<00:03:27.970> table<00:03:28.720> wet<00:03:29.049> all<00:03:29.560> this<00:03:30.040> will<00:03:30.250> soak<00:03:30.489> up<00:03:30.519> the

your table wet all this will soak up the
water<00:03:30.850> pretty<00:03:31.269> good<00:03:31.540> so<00:03:31.720> it<00:03:31.810> might<00:03:31.900> be<00:03:31.959> when<00:03:32.230> I

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260

get<00:03:32.380> this<00:03:32.680> back<00:03:32.890> I'm<00:03:33.100> probably<00:03:33.280> going<00:03:33.580> to<00:03:33.640> turn

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
get this back I'm probably going to turn

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.240 
get this back I'm probably going to turn
around<00:03:33.880> and<00:03:34.150> treat<00:03:34.299> it<00:03:34.360> with<00:03:34.660> some<00:03:35.320> silicon
