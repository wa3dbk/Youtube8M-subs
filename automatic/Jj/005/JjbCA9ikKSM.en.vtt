00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
annualizing i thought was fine since

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.070 
annualizing i thought was fine since
they<00:01:39.640> had<00:01:39.790> two<00:01:40.000> different<00:01:40.150> either<00:01:40.510> working<00:01:40.840> on

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
they had two different either working on

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.600 
they had two different either working on
it<00:01:41.200> so<00:01:41.320> you're<00:01:41.470> getting<00:01:41.590> two<00:01:41.920> years<00:01:42.190> of<00:01:42.370> work

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
it so you're getting two years of work

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.030 
it so you're getting two years of work
on<00:01:42.850> central<00:01:43.300> game<00:01:43.540> but<00:01:44.080> now<00:01:44.260> it's<00:01:44.470> two<00:01:44.770> games

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:50.800 
know they should slow down maybe take a

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.400 
know they should slow down maybe take a
couple<00:01:51.040> year<00:01:51.250> break<00:01:51.550> um<00:01:51.900> you<00:01:52.900> know<00:01:53.020> it<00:01:53.230> has
