fluorescent any bulb will go in there
and<00:01:24.649> work<00:01:24.920> I<00:01:25.220> like<00:01:25.640> to<00:01:25.819> use<00:01:26.000> fluorescent<00:01:26.630> bulbs

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
and work I like to use fluorescent bulbs

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.279 
and work I like to use fluorescent bulbs

and you can get red colored florescent
bulbs<00:01:30.530> I<00:01:30.619> like<00:01:30.770> to<00:01:30.890> use<00:01:31.009> those<00:01:31.250> because<00:01:31.429> they

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
bulbs I like to use those because they

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:35.350 
bulbs I like to use those because they
don't<00:01:31.940> put<00:01:32.090> off<00:01:32.240> very<00:01:32.750> much<00:01:32.810> heat<00:01:33.170> and<00:01:34.360> which

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
don't put off very much heat and which

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.550 
don't put off very much heat and which
makes<00:01:35.630> it<00:01:35.780> a<00:01:35.810> little<00:01:35.959> bit<00:01:36.080> easier<00:01:36.349> to<00:01:36.440> work

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
makes it a little bit easier to work

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.040 
makes it a little bit easier to work
with<00:01:36.619> so<00:01:37.130> that's<00:01:37.670> all<00:01:37.970> I<00:01:38.000> use<00:01:38.119> you<00:01:38.810> only

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 
with so that's all I use you only

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.249 
with so that's all I use you only
probably<00:01:39.440> need<00:01:39.709> one<00:01:40.479> for<00:01:41.479> printing<00:01:41.959> at<00:01:42.080> home

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
probably need one for printing at home

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:44.199 
probably need one for printing at home
and<00:01:42.470> stuff<00:01:42.649> like<00:01:42.860> that<00:01:43.069> because<00:01:43.490> you<00:01:44.119> know

00:01:44.199 --> 00:01:44.209 
and stuff like that because you know

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:45.580 
and stuff like that because you know
you're<00:01:44.360> in<00:01:44.450> a<00:01:44.509> smaller<00:01:44.810> space<00:01:45.020> I<00:01:45.380> have

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
you're in a smaller space I have

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.680 
you're in a smaller space I have
multiple<00:01:46.190> bulbs<00:01:46.550> because<00:01:46.729> sometimes<00:01:47.330> I<00:01:47.479> work

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:47.690 
multiple bulbs because sometimes I work

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.910 
multiple bulbs because sometimes I work
in<00:01:47.959> two<00:01:48.800> areas<00:01:49.039> or<00:01:50.259> my<00:01:51.259> space<00:01:51.500> is<00:01:51.739> a<00:01:51.770> little

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
in two areas or my space is a little

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.740 
in two areas or my space is a little
bigger<00:01:52.250> so<00:01:52.399> I<00:01:52.670> need<00:01:52.940> a<00:01:52.970> little<00:01:53.209> bit<00:01:53.330> more<00:01:53.509> light

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
bigger so I need a little bit more light

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.050 
bigger so I need a little bit more light
to<00:01:54.020> light<00:01:54.200> the<00:01:54.500> area<00:01:54.679> top<00:01:55.099> but<00:01:55.640> for<00:01:55.849> the<00:01:55.910> most

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
to light the area top but for the most

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.540 
to light the area top but for the most
part<00:01:56.300> you<00:01:56.390> probably<00:01:56.690> only<00:01:56.869> need<00:01:56.989> one<00:01:57.319> and<00:01:57.590> this

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
part you probably only need one and this

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.820 
part you probably only need one and this
will<00:01:58.729> help<00:01:59.000> you<00:01:59.270> you<00:01:59.509> know<00:01:59.630> avoid<00:02:00.319> those

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
will help you you know avoid those

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.350 
will help you you know avoid those
variables<00:02:01.459> remember<00:02:01.849> I<00:02:01.880> always<00:02:02.209> say

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
variables remember I always say

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.419 
variables remember I always say
eliminate<00:02:02.840> your<00:02:02.959> variables<00:02:03.560> so<00:02:03.709> 1<00:02:03.860> a<00:02:03.890> variable

00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:04.429 
eliminate your variables so 1 a variable

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:07.719 
eliminate your variables so 1 a variable
to<00:02:04.550> eliminate<00:02:04.670> is<00:02:05.319> your<00:02:06.319> is<00:02:07.039> daylight<00:02:07.489> any

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
to eliminate is your is daylight any

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.900 
to eliminate is your is daylight any
kind<00:02:07.970> of<00:02:08.030> daylight<00:02:08.420> or<00:02:09.080> such<00:02:09.470> that<00:02:09.739> can<00:02:09.979> get<00:02:10.369> on

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
kind of daylight or such that can get on

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.120 
kind of daylight or such that can get on
your<00:02:11.300> screen<00:02:11.599> in<00:02:11.840> the<00:02:12.020> screen<00:02:12.290> making<00:02:12.590> process

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
down in the in the wash out booth that's

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:29.449 
down in the in the wash out booth that's
pretty<00:02:28.800> much<00:02:28.950> fine

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
pretty much fine

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:30.770 
pretty much fine
but<00:02:29.610> in<00:02:29.940> other<00:02:30.060> words<00:02:30.269> you<00:02:30.420> don't<00:02:30.569> want<00:02:30.720> to

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
but in other words you don't want to

but in other words you don't want to
have<00:02:30.900> to<00:02:31.019> walk<00:02:31.230> like<00:02:31.800> through<00:02:32.160> massive

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
have to walk like through massive

have to walk like through massive
daylight<00:02:33.090> to<00:02:33.269> bring<00:02:33.510> your<00:02:33.950> screen<00:02:34.950> out<00:02:35.160> to

daylight to bring your screen out to
wash<00:02:35.550> now<00:02:35.910> a<00:02:36.150> lot<00:02:36.540> of<00:02:36.569> emulsions<00:02:37.170> aren't

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
wash now a lot of emulsions aren't

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.710 
wash now a lot of emulsions aren't
really<00:02:37.709> that<00:02:37.890> fast<00:02:38.340> enough<00:02:38.819> to<00:02:39.090> really<00:02:39.599> be

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
really that fast enough to really be

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.780 
really that fast enough to really be
affected<00:02:40.319> a<00:02:40.380> whole<00:02:40.410> lot<00:02:40.739> by<00:02:40.950> it<00:02:41.010> but<00:02:41.340> there<00:02:41.760> are

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
affected a whole lot by it but there are

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.940 
affected a whole lot by it but there are
some<00:02:42.150> emulsions<00:02:42.660> projection<00:02:43.319> emulsions<00:02:43.769> and

some emulsions projection emulsions and

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.040 
some emulsions projection emulsions and
things<00:02:44.130> that<00:02:44.250> possibly<00:02:45.090> could<00:02:45.330> get<00:02:45.480> fogged<00:02:45.780> by

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
things that possibly could get fogged by

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.259 
things that possibly could get fogged by
that<00:02:46.200> sort<00:02:46.410> of<00:02:46.500> thing<00:02:46.680> so<00:02:46.709> you<00:02:47.549> know<00:02:47.580> eliminate

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
that sort of thing so you know eliminate

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.390 
that sort of thing so you know eliminate
the<00:02:48.390> variable<00:02:48.810> work<00:02:49.560> with<00:02:49.799> the<00:02:49.890> safe<00:02:50.130> light

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
the variable work with the safe light

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.210 
the variable work with the safe light
it's<00:02:51.180> just<00:02:51.510> something<00:02:52.440> that's<00:02:52.560> easy<00:02:52.890> to<00:02:53.069> do

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
it's just something that's easy to do

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.460 
it's just something that's easy to do
doesn't<00:02:53.610> cost<00:02:53.760> much<00:02:54.090> and<00:02:54.299> you<00:02:55.019> get<00:02:55.230> rid<00:02:55.440> of

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
doesn't cost much and you get rid of

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.229 
doesn't cost much and you get rid of
that<00:02:55.799> variable<00:02:56.730> that<00:02:56.819> could<00:02:57.000> cause<00:02:57.209> any

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
that variable that could cause any

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.900 
that variable that could cause any
problems<00:02:57.840> and<00:02:57.989> that's<00:02:58.080> it<00:02:58.549> work<00:02:59.549> in<00:02:59.670> a<00:02:59.730> safe

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
problems and that's it work in a safe

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.000 
problems and that's it work in a safe
flight<00:03:00.209> red<00:03:00.510> or<00:03:00.630> yellow<00:03:00.750> light<00:03:00.930> or<00:03:01.349> very<00:03:01.890> very

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
flight red or yellow light or very very

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.240 
flight red or yellow light or very very
subdued<00:03:02.579> you<00:03:03.510> know<00:03:03.630> room<00:03:04.410> light<00:03:04.680> could<00:03:05.220> be

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
subdued you know room light could be

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.240 
subdued you know room light could be
okay<00:03:05.640> too<00:03:05.700> but<00:03:06.239> make<00:03:06.630> it<00:03:06.660> really<00:03:06.780> subdued
