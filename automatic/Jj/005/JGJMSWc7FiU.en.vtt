00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
just to get into the system where you

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.619 
just to get into the system where you
can't<00:00:47.280> do<00:00:47.399> anything<00:00:47.610> where<00:00:47.940> I<00:00:47.969> posted<00:00:48.329> videos

about<00:00:48.840> that<00:00:48.989> before<00:00:49.350> this<00:00:49.950> is<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.370> full<00:00:50.700> bypass

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
about that before this is a full bypass

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.750 
about that before this is a full bypass
where<00:00:51.600> you<00:00:51.719> can<00:00:51.870> just<00:00:52.050> remove<00:00:52.379> it<00:00:52.500> completely

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
where you can just remove it completely

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.220 
where you can just remove it completely
be<00:00:53.760> dealt<00:00:54.000> with<00:00:54.059> that<00:00:54.329> you'll<00:00:54.570> be<00:00:54.690> inside<00:00:55.050> the

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
be dealt with that you'll be inside the

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.720 
be dealt with that you'll be inside the
Iowa<00:00:55.530> system<00:00:56.010> permanently

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
Iowa system permanently

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.029 
Iowa system permanently
so<00:00:57.120> this<00:00:57.329> is<00:00:57.539> non-removable<00:00:57.930> it's<00:00:58.410> permanent

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
so this is non-removable it's permanent

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.430 
so this is non-removable it's permanent
now<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.579> only<00:00:59.820> problem<00:01:00.120> is<00:01:00.510> there<00:01:01.199> is<00:01:01.410> a

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
now the only problem is there is a

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.009 
now the only problem is there is a
certain<00:01:02.010> server<00:01:02.340> there<00:01:02.670> has<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:02.940> be<00:01:03.149> alive<00:01:03.629> and

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
certain server there has to be alive and

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.690 
certain server there has to be alive and
running<00:01:04.290> at<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.680> moment<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:05.220> you<00:01:05.339> doing<00:01:05.489> this

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
running at the moment of you doing this

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.510 
running at the moment of you doing this
so<00:01:05.970> right<00:01:06.600> now<00:01:06.780> that<00:01:06.810> server<00:01:07.260> is<00:01:07.380> down<00:01:07.740> only

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
so right now that server is down only

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.250 
so right now that server is down only
when<00:01:08.700> it's<00:01:08.850> up<00:01:09.060> later<00:01:09.570> this<00:01:09.780> weekend<00:01:10.170> I

the<00:01:28.890> future<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.460> can't<00:01:29.729> really<00:01:29.850> say<00:01:30.150> if<00:01:30.210> it'll

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
the future I can't really say if it'll

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.080 
the future I can't really say if it'll
work<00:01:30.659> on<00:01:30.930> iOS<00:01:31.890> 8<00:01:32.130> or<00:01:32.310> anything<00:01:32.520> like<00:01:32.729> that<00:01:32.790> but

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
work on iOS 8 or anything like that but

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.109 
work on iOS 8 or anything like that but
for<00:01:33.240> now<00:01:33.299> it<00:01:33.630> does<00:01:33.900> work<00:01:34.140> on<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.500> latest<00:01:35.119> 7.1.1

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
for now it does work on the latest 7.1.1

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.280 
for now it does work on the latest 7.1.1
7.1.2

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
7.1.2

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.800 
7.1.2
so<00:01:37.619> it<00:01:38.009> does<00:01:38.250> work<00:01:38.280> on<00:01:38.610> iOS<00:01:39.000> 7<00:01:39.180> now<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.630> way

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
so it does work on iOS 7 now the way

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.420 
so it does work on iOS 7 now the way
that<00:01:39.990> this<00:01:40.079> activation<00:01:40.590> lock<00:01:40.890> permanent

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
that this activation lock permanent

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.789 
that this activation lock permanent
bypass<00:01:41.759> works<00:01:42.060> is<00:01:42.299> basically<00:01:43.079> you're<00:01:43.649> going

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
bypass works is basically you're going

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.859 
bypass works is basically you're going
to<00:01:43.860> have<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.250> replace<00:01:44.549> your<00:01:44.700> hosts<00:01:45.060> file<00:01:45.270> or

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
to have to replace your hosts file or

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.440 
to have to replace your hosts file or
modify<00:01:46.350> it<00:01:46.380> so<00:01:46.979> that<00:01:47.009> iTunes<00:01:47.670> believes<00:01:48.210> that

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
modify it so that iTunes believes that

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.179 
modify it so that iTunes believes that
it's<00:01:48.630> contacting<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.350> Apple<00:01:49.649> server<00:01:49.890> and

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
it's contacting the Apple server and

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.249 
it's contacting the Apple server and
that<00:01:50.670> server<00:01:50.909> is<00:01:51.090> telling<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:51.540> that<00:01:51.570> you<00:01:52.079> no

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
that server is telling you that you no

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.050 
that server is telling you that you no
longer<00:01:52.290> do<00:01:52.710> this<00:01:52.890> activation<00:01:53.310> lock<00:01:53.610> that<00:01:53.909> you

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
longer do this activation lock that you

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.370 
longer do this activation lock that you
just<00:01:54.240> put<00:01:54.390> in<00:01:54.479> your<00:01:54.509> password<00:01:54.750> or<00:01:55.110> whatever

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
just put in your password or whatever

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.289 
just put in your password or whatever
however<00:01:55.680> you<00:01:56.340> have<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.520> redirect<00:01:56.939> your<00:01:57.119> hosts

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
however you have to redirect your hosts

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.139 
however you have to redirect your hosts
file<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.290> dulcis<00:01:58.619> team<00:01:58.829> server<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.520> it'll

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
file to the dulcis team server and it'll

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.940 
file to the dulcis team server and it'll
basically<00:02:00.240> spoof<00:02:00.899> your<00:02:01.079> itunes<00:02:01.619> into

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
basically spoof your itunes into

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.679 
basically spoof your itunes into
believing<00:02:02.310> that<00:02:02.460> your<00:02:02.670> iPhone<00:02:02.820> is<00:02:03.270> no<00:02:03.479> longer

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
believing that your iPhone is no longer

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.600 
believing that your iPhone is no longer
activation<00:02:04.380> locked<00:02:04.590> so<00:02:04.920> it'll<00:02:05.189> go<00:02:05.310> ahead<00:02:05.490> and

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
activation locked so it'll go ahead and

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.580 
activation locked so it'll go ahead and
remove<00:02:05.729> that<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.180> a<00:02:06.659> second<00:02:07.020> step<00:02:07.200> involves

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
remove that and a second step involves

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.889 
remove that and a second step involves
putting<00:02:08.220> a<00:02:08.369> simple<00:02:08.940> lock<00:02:09.209> on<00:02:09.479> your<00:02:09.599> SIM<00:02:09.869> card

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
putting a simple lock on your SIM card

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:10.710 
putting a simple lock on your SIM card
so<00:02:10.410> you

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
so you

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.750 
so you
to<00:02:10.869> have<00:02:11.050> an<00:02:11.200> active<00:02:11.590> SIM<00:02:11.860> card<00:02:12.100> for<00:02:12.670> your

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
to have an active SIM card for your

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.150 
to have an active SIM card for your
phone<00:02:12.820> with<00:02:13.630> a<00:02:13.660> simp<00:02:14.230> in<00:02:14.440> on<00:02:14.650> it<00:02:14.830> and<00:02:14.950> I'll<00:02:15.010> go

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
phone with a simp in on it and I'll go

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.770 
phone with a simp in on it and I'll go
ahead<00:02:15.250> and<00:02:15.430> explain<00:02:15.760> that<00:02:15.940> in<00:02:16.150> further<00:02:16.420> detail

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
ahead and explain that in further detail

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.560 
ahead and explain that in further detail
in<00:02:17.080> the<00:02:17.290> tutorial<00:02:17.440> video<00:02:17.980> however<00:02:18.250> just<00:02:19.150> be
