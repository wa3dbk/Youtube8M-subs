00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.660
 the day has come and the end of 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:17.920
 week of your return to motorsport 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.840
 international in your country a feeling 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.450
 which I imagine must be very special how 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:25.029
 you are going to chest well well well pleased of 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:27.119
 obviously to have this this magnificent 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:27.119
 opportunity 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:34.090
 in a world category so 

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:36.550
 enjoying enjoying it so much 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.950
 trying of course to get the best 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.350
 of 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.210
 the best of the car and the equipment to 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.000
 try to make a good career and which 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:49.340
 are the sensations above the bm w 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.890
 nadal and it is not a car with much 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.190
 a lot of electronics but if they are auto much 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.190
 plus 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.180
 I could not say much more group no 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:02.460
 much more standard 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.320
 turbo engine 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.040
 and they are cars that go more slowly with their 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.810
 length 2000 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.370
 but it's good because of the type of regulation 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.410
 that the pilots have and the 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:13.450
 technical level there is is excellent 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.470
 how should be the management what things should you 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.660
 change what you're used to 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.450
 here in argentina in its part 2000 a 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.369
 top root 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.380
 no it is not a car a little more without saying 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:26.280
 especially the bm w that this action of the 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.580
 wax met quite a bit with the 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.310
 back of the car 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.380
 so good you work to make it a 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.060
 little more 12 I already knew it is the layout 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.220
 with all the modifications 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.829
 doing it with this vehicle changes a lot 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.439
 the references that you had the change for 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.840
 course the braking points that 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.270
 yes and also what one has to do 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.369
 with the car itself because it's different not 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.020
 I have been able to talk with your colleagues about this 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.659
 great investment of this autodrome of 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.890
 international level that Argentina has 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.850
 He is very happy with him 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.230
 racetrack 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:05.070
 it is an excellent self-employed 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:08.250
 very very good worldwide and good 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.930
 I think you can receive this category 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.460
 perfectly smooth them 

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:13.800
 I asked how you felt on top of the 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.330
 auto and how do you feel down surrounded by 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.580
 the whole international environment something that 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.670
 you lived for many years to align and not 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.440
 it's a little bit will relive the sensation 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.740
 when they paid for the canceled championship 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.600
 because ultimately it is a championship 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:29.460
 that everyone travels together you have everything 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.700
 within the payment how is together with them 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.320
 you move together and good is a little 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.480
 similar to what I was 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.400
 used to it so this is a 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.780
 special feeling that comes the 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.400
 doubly be the Argentina and 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.310
 immediately the name of 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:47.180
 pechito lopez if the bar that if 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.310
 Opera grateful with the opportunity 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.989
 Thank you 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.420
 obviously to a group of people who 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:55.190
 always wanted me to represent 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.580
 Argentina in the case of the automobile 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.580
 club 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.920
 my old man of course he is the 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.940
 principal that wants me to do something 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.890
 this kind of this type of careers and 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.080
 and good people also of course the 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.120
 donation of santiago del estero bueno 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.580
 now that of the same organization of the 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.050
 career for me is a cowardly pride 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.480
 be representing the colors 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.280
 Argentines but sometimes you can stay 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.340
 some door as to be deluded with 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:26.000
 do something else in what comes next 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.000
 that if 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.800
 no I do not know now I'm focused on 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.890
 treated in some things I repeat for me 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:36.390
 It would be nice to be able to do it but to 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.390
 in the situation is not easy or 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:43.889
 I dedicate myself to this also and I will have to 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:46.230
 look for the sponsors and that she 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:48.930
 obviously multiplied by 8 by the 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.900
 euro and it's not easy now that it's not 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:56.840
 easy but if there is an opportunity I will 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.840
 be accompanied throughout the weekend
