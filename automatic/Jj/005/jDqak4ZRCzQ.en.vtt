00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 How do I have my question on the 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.069
 beginning of the video I do not know but now that 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.509
 managed to spread the secret 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.340
 to the galley in the comments 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.230
 wagner tells a bad joke send one 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:15.210
 Kiss me a pokémon, that's the way we are 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:17.279
 have to arise and I have to wash one 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.990
 kisses hand vague because the blackboard 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.050
 is green for the same reason as corn 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.850
 green and yellow can not 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.769
 to produce a song about french fries 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.420
 with you when you bring 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.369
 the city is a good question in your 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.349
 city ​​or anywhere else we can 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.000
 touch if you do not prevent events 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.960
 that happen in your city where cities 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.940
 close 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.320
 we always need the contact of the events 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.300
 are they in contracts so that the 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.340
 people can play then it depends 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.770
 sometimes more at events and yours 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.390
 same as our people need them to 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.190
 contract events to power up to 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.399
 So you know some society. 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.649
 event there goes there ask later how 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.480
 Who knows, we do not see the 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.940
 What did you think of Spider-Man of Avengers? 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.940
 I found it a good challenge to read Italian, bye 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:04.140
 does not act as a big fan of italy only in 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.549
 timing or fratello for free and yes no 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.200
 I can speak in Italian means to mess around. 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.479
 in the hand that way was not the most 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.920
 already done the butterfly a 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.540
 special participation of several 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.369
 October for sure that he has a stamp 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.140
 Samba will go beyond the country japan 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.970
 would you like to visit and why? 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.130
 spain because there they speak Spanish is 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.110
 a little easier to understand and because of 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.780
 from barcelona as you go without fringe 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:30.000
 so it looks like having a perfect fringe 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.979
 Just take a wig and glasses maybe 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.509
 a magic for me please then was 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.869
 do a magic with your mouth since the 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.869
 man asked 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.640
 the camera on the skin has always been a 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.310
 dream 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.049
 so look, I'm going to use mine here 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.950
 mental powers 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:55.280
 Did you get the 1st of sticks? 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.590
 image paul right you are the obvious you 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.810
 You're fourteen back here from the deck. 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:04.520
 now you want me to try to find the asphalt 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:08.959
 In the middle I'll do it for the people then it will 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:12.319
 find the slack in his deck 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.880
 So, finally, let's see some great 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:17.329
 part of the thing, huh? 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:20.709
 just stop here right now the deck is 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:20.709
 rescuing the magic of the ox 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:35.720
 let's see each of the rafts 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:38.540
 Look, I could only show the black magic. 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.459
 guys do not do it at home if you do not 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:47.569
 know yourself and the euro you are 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:49.910
 strong or weak because the lion is the king of 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:51.920
 jungle he lives in the savannah because rita 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.420
 savannah and a bit of shit, let's 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.220
 king of the jungle is much more imposing 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.540
 much more respect is as if 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.010
 it was a title 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.870
 for example lawyers as soon as they 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.519
 form they are called doctors 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.109
 even without a doctorate 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:05.420
 then a lion does more or less the same 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:06.109
 unused thing and the jungle because it has 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.940
 more modesty 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:09.859
 It is true that the soil does not 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.750
 he showered with the same frequency 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:13.910
 that appears here in the tragicomic ie 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.620
 once a month with the dn soundtrack 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.450
 that you have interpreted until today that more 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.160
 marked me because it is difficult to choose 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.620
 I would choose fullmetal alchemist because 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.540
 It is the preferred name that there all 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.620
 songs that refer to a very 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.720
 good 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.510
 they are all good at working on 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.040
 a band with 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.170
 This is much better than working with 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.780
 people who are not so friendly Brazil 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.739
 as well as behind how tragic it would be if 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.750
 it was not me 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:39.269
 beyond the saulo can transform kurtyka 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.730
 games which good cousin toninho salt 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:46.560
 I also like medium and I swallowed 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:48.989
 de yo and now what are you going to do to 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.480
 facing the three jobs for the drug 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:53.510
 in three white lagoons 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.310
 I do not have anything to face them here. 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:04:03.390
 and now it starts in the letters 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:05.670
 help me the chance i start october 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.599
 playing with greed to think of the 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.090
 two houses 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:09.959
 Let's go to the cards, please. 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.870
 everything or nothing 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:16.289
 help me human in the world 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:19.199
 yes yes alone can not feel the 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:22.949
 elton in the strength of letters is the last 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:25.050
 chance now you understand that it takes yes 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:28.110
 the power of marketing now for sure 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:30.479
 I'm going to destroy, I'm going to start the game. 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.520
 first I use the exchange of collections 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:34.949
 to take control of one of your 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.169
 white dragons my white car its 

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:39.000
 brother titty in the erotic of the year 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:42.510
 now let's sacrifice my two 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.389
 Letters to evoke skinny black or white 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:46.919
 The mage and glass will then destroy 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:48.599
 all your magic cards and 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:51.440
 traps face down with my 

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:53.669
 black magic attack 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:56.800
 now build another white dragon 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:59.110
 using my thousand knives 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.090
 did not escape the question and to finalize the 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.919
 Equator the black magician my power 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.810
 I sing for him one of the points of 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:06.370
 drag attack letter magical trap 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:08.590
 that I have in the field so 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.490
 totaling 6000 points of attack for 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.970
 the black lake 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:14.259
 My god, and if every now and then you attack 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:17.159
 black magic 

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:17.159
 if not told 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.009
 already thought of bringing technicians to 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.300
 channel looks who knows we can not 

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:24.879
 bring tags back here as 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.919
 corresponds beggs challenges charades 

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:28.659
 Anyway, I think it's a good place to 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:30.940
 and put their ideas into practice 

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:33.669
 that sometimes appear on youtube 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:35.560
 so if you have any tags any one 

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:36.849
 challenge that was to send to the next 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.919
 program on anything that passes 

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:40.810
 Heads up for the top of the questions. 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:43.300
 that we will try to do everything by 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:45.879
 here trying to do everything is impossible but 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.379
 right as many things that have to 

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:49.659
 you the government's opposition command 

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:51.819
 Portugal send a kiss to the galera of 

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:54.129

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:56.830
 Look, we 'd just love to 

00:05:54.129 --> 00:05:58.960
 Portugal and we hope to have 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.759
 this opportunity because it would be too much 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.139
 even because if in Spain only one Spanish 

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:04.569
 that it is easy to understand why portugal is 

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:06.099
 only a Portuguese who is even easier is 

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:07.389
