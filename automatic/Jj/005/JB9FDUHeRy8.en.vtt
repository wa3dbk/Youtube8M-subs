00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 Werder showed very clearly down last year they were after the sixth 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.250
 Matchday still third from 15 to 4 7 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.760
 Pants play without a single hit meanwhile slipped life 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.849
 table midfielder and the great hope of the Oberhausener was today 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:22.410
 opposing goalkeeper Janik the left has he has in the past 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.180
 play the opposing teams always thus scoring gates invited 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.210
 Euro and of course the question arises, he makes this today but Sven 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.739
 Schröter played from the very beginning whoever he still wins 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:38.490
 dropouts 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.270
 Goalkeeper change won at Union Berlin 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.410
 that was Marcel Höttecke 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:45.860
 is little 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.300
 hike 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.980
 the former Dortmund for the first time in goal again only on the Bank Union Berlin 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.160
 against red 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.880
 from the beginning the dominant team first chance first minute 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.100
 final whistle 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.560
 there would have been leaders for women only looking after 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.870
 The Berlin last very much with the away win over Bielefeld 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.360
 very motivated and the turning circled he admitted he had to admit that 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.659
 You could have been penalties, too 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.150
 was not an issue in this next play opportunity 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.700
 the Astor with a parry against Stoch 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.690
 March expired 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.360
 the development does not really start at the beginning but only the Oberhausener 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.780
 Keeper big chances for Berlin we had the game well under control 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.740
 the guests Sion 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.119
 30 minute artist from Kirchberg big victories 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.220
 made great and then look at the counter 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.780
 two three stations all looks very harmless from Schmidtgal 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.830
 Felix Luz meanwhile recovered goalscorer Lutz Heese 10 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.300
 there was Cacau 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.570
 30 stop meter Felix Luz for so long he was injured his first compulsory goal 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.210
 for Oberhausen 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.580
 At first, that's the big chance for the Berliner Tor 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.840
 Girl Pirson clarifies and then it goes quite fast and the Berlin just too 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.129
 passively there in midfield the loads 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.079
 the guests hard 

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:17.069
 none of the power takes care of his first second league goal since Lutz 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:22.769
 Phantom 2008 untenable for Ivica the prosecutor made his own 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:26.159
 thoughts 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:28.079
 that is half an hour 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:29.529
 just before the break 

00:02:29.529 --> 00:02:33.099
 again the Berliners over the entire first car radio the clearly better 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:36.449
 Team were 

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:38.099
 that compensation 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.269
 even before the break 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:43.269
 last hit twice in a row 

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:47.389
 Class staged no offside 

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:51.060
 as we can see the pass came from Mattuschka and then with a lot 

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:52.269
 feeling 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.790
 07 but you do not do enough 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.849
 and they were so clearly superior at halftime one 

00:02:58.509 --> 00:03:00.859
 that will be a sign of mourning 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:04.039
 we are again 4 60 minutes not reconcilable 

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:05.359
 with a counter 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:08.369
 and for criticism had to be right and distinguished for the first time 

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:11.379
 changeable on counter 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:15.519
 and was actually happy with the point then we look at almost everyone 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:16.679
 sixth minute 

00:03:16.679 --> 00:03:19.759
 Chief of this measures the rework 

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:23.039
 and meanwhile king came in to substitute only the post 

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:28.219
 Ronny König with the big opportunity for red-white Oberhausen 

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:29.229
 the value 

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:33.299
 have been pointing out imprisonment but there he comes up pointing 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.699
 unnecessary hassle had no chance 

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:38.279
 So all signs are on and who are not 

00:03:38.279 --> 00:03:40.919
 Dead minute of stoppage time Kolmar 

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:43.709
 or when he gets money again 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.679
 his second hit 

00:03:45.679 --> 00:03:48.289
 no longer thought possible 

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:50.779
 four of the last five Berliner Tor 

00:03:50.779 --> 00:03:53.449
 everyone enjoys Yanina 

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:56.979
 who now has an invitation from the Algerian national team itself 

00:03:56.979 --> 00:04:00.259
 no offside passive off the beaten track but never after 

00:04:00.899 --> 00:04:02.499
 everything OK 

00:04:02.499 --> 00:04:05.919
 and thus cheers even with the new keeper 

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:08.549
 two individual victories Union Berlin 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:12.409
 has earned the nationwide in on 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:13.859
 of course very much
