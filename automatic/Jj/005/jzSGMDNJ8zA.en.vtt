00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:36.309
 This little 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:39.309
 When you look at the aika ipad , the screen is a little different from when it is a computer screen 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:40.220

 This is a movie of all the notes 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:05.130
 The point is that you can find everything with that keyword 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:09.180
 Tokima So, for example, when the meeting is it to Toka softening promise by telephone 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:11.560
 It's google like scheduling was yesterday 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.210
 Or that it is the content of the meeting 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:19.450
 A little possible

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:58.750
 That even when you Toka examine or something with one of the keywords 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:59.620
 It's like opening the note and exercising it evernote
