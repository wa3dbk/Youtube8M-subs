 Last time, Samsung's new mp3 player 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.819
 I raised the issue of ipi won. 

00:00:08.819 --> 00:00:11.819
 This time, the phone was highlighted one day 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:15.959
 By the end of January, which is even more emphatic. 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:19.670
 It is an unprecedented tax evasion incident in the industry. 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.649
 This type of sale 

00:00:21.649 --> 00:00:24.649
 Then I see the interface. Most business 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.779
 But now the walls are well organized, 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:31.779
 Let's talk about it intensively. 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.710
 second 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.350
 Most of 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.350
 I'll take a quick look at life. 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.290
 There is a big change in sales 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.640
 I can notice it at once. Like an idiot 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.640
 If you use a 2.75 display 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.310
 It was easy to get a feeling that the u-room would be nice, 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.910
 The model 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.530
 Communication service it ..3 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.130
 I understand the situation and its simple 1.3 million 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.420
 I am not oled to the judge who has about 26 actions and 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.730
 Instead of using a diode, the active power consumption 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:16.290
 Written 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.220
 In the 30s of the old spook instinct, 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:21.500
 Fit 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.500
 It shows a smooth screen. I have a bell 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.850
 Another noticeable profit balance .com 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.009
 Samsung is the first to be an mp3 player and Marvel 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.210
 I can feel the adoption of an external memory slot comically 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:36.520
 There is 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.240
 In the past, there was a limit of capacity, 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.400
 It's hard to catch it. 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.330
 3614's built-in memory, 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.760
 Built-in memory 32.8 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.860
 It can play 64 roles 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.500
 It can be said to be a feature. So the video mainly 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.100
 If you use 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.580
 You can listen to live internet videos without the burden of capacity. 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.240
 There is. And if there's another difference, 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.760
 It was not in the original statement 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.389
 We support personalization so that we can watch vitamin d broadcasting 

00:02:11.389 --> 00:02:14.389
 I do not support terrestrial dmb. 

00:02:15.779 --> 00:02:17.209
 Missing votes 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.459
 I'm going to release it. 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.459
 ibm looking at them 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.069
 Graphics card sensitive candidate of the 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.919
 The reason is that Aaron was not used 

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:32.279
 Under the shoulder 

00:02:32.279 --> 00:02:35.449
 Guys, the app2006- is gone. 

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:38.519
 As is known, this year's chipsets are not ready to go. 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:41.519
 I can say that is the end. 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:44.560
 mp3 player with cpu 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.180
 Since the functions are simultaneously activated, 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.180
 Between power consumption and graphics processing speed 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:52.989
 What I wanted 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:57.400
 By using eads 1600 you can say that Aaron's 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.019
 The Holy Land is too 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:01.279
 About 

00:03:01.279 --> 00:03:03.929
 720 resolution video is enough to be able to use wave smoothly 

00:03:03.929 --> 00:03:06.929
 That's it. 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.869
 Up to now about Samsung mp3 player eman 

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:14.799
 I looked at it. 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:18.779
 A couple of Samsung hanging mp3 players through emr 

00:03:18.779 --> 00:03:21.389
 Face one's goals 

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:22.719
 at pronto. 

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:25.229
 Liver function will continue to be strengthened 

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:28.639
 am oled is the next generation video 

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:30.449
 You can see it properly. 

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:32.749
 Net sell Samsung mp3 player 

00:03:32.749 --> 00:03:35.059
 Such as 

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:36.619
 It will be different. I will do this.
