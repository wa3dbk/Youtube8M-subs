instead of having to you know click on
an<00:01:33.659> attribute<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:34.170> use<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.380> sliding<00:01:34.740> scale

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
tools to be able to do that for sure and

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:47.229 
tools to be able to do that for sure and
then<00:02:45.830> once<00:02:46.070> again<00:02:46.160> that<00:02:46.400> was<00:02:46.489> also<00:02:46.760> reflected

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
then once again that was also reflected

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.270 
then once again that was also reflected
in<00:02:47.390> the<00:02:47.450> the<00:02:47.959> build<00:02:48.170> mode<00:02:48.440> where<00:02:49.040> when<00:02:49.160> you're

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
in the the build mode where when you're

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.070 
in the the build mode where when you're
building<00:02:49.550> a<00:02:49.700> house<00:02:49.880> it<00:02:50.239> was<00:02:50.390> just<00:02:50.420> so<00:02:50.930> much

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
building a house it was just so much

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.150 
building a house it was just so much
just<00:02:51.320> seems<00:02:51.440> like<00:02:51.530> it's<00:02:51.709> gonna<00:02:51.769> be<00:02:51.980> a<00:02:52.010> lot

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
just seems like it's gonna be a lot

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.250 
just seems like it's gonna be a lot
easier<00:02:52.370> to<00:02:52.910> build<00:02:53.540> houses<00:02:53.780> than<00:02:54.050> it<00:02:54.170> was

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
easier to build houses than it was

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.630 
easier to build houses than it was
previously<00:02:54.470> no<00:02:54.950> it<00:02:55.070> was<00:02:55.160> always<00:02:55.370> a<00:02:55.519> little

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
previously no it was always a little

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.910 
previously no it was always a little
frustrating<00:02:56.330> to<00:02:56.480> use<00:02:56.570> that<00:02:56.780> tool<00:02:57.019> in<00:02:57.290> the<00:02:57.680> past

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
frustrating to use that tool in the past

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.560 
frustrating to use that tool in the past
but<00:02:58.190> that's<00:02:58.610> not<00:02:58.730> where<00:02:58.820> I<00:02:58.880> was<00:02:59.060> trying<00:02:59.299> to<00:02:59.390> put

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
tool has to be still very powerful and

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.750 
tool has to be still very powerful and
we<00:03:21.019> needed<00:03:21.260> to<00:03:21.440> make<00:03:21.620> sure<00:03:21.650> that<00:03:22.010> we<00:03:22.190> built<00:03:22.489> all

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
we needed to make sure that we built all

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.789 
we needed to make sure that we built all
of<00:03:22.910> that<00:03:23.030> in<00:03:23.180> as<00:03:23.330> well<00:03:23.600> but<00:03:24.230> for<00:03:24.410> those<00:03:24.590> that

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.300 
creative sim tool and the build

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.900 
creative sim tool and the build
being<00:03:44.260> able<00:03:44.350> to<00:03:44.470> have<00:03:44.680> it<00:03:44.710> be<00:03:44.830> tactile<00:03:45.550> and
