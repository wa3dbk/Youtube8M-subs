in<00:00:00.659> this<00:00:00.900> video<00:00:01.170> we're<00:00:01.319> going<00:00:01.439> to<00:00:01.530> demonstrate

00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:01.709 
in this video we're going to demonstrate

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:04.550 
in this video we're going to demonstrate
how<00:00:02.159> to<00:00:02.190> use<00:00:02.340> a<00:00:02.490> memory<00:00:02.790> saver<00:00:03.319> memory<00:00:04.319> saver

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
how to use a memory saver memory saver

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.950 
how to use a memory saver memory saver
is<00:00:04.710> used<00:00:04.920> to<00:00:05.130> keep<00:00:05.370> the<00:00:05.910> memory<00:00:06.480> inside<00:00:06.779> of<00:00:06.899> the

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
is used to keep the memory inside of the

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.440 
is used to keep the memory inside of the
computers<00:00:07.500> from<00:00:07.890> being<00:00:08.250> erased<00:00:08.580> when<00:00:09.090> we

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
computers from being erased when we

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.120 
computers from being erased when we
disconnect<00:00:09.870> the<00:00:09.960> battery<00:00:10.290> on<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.469> car<00:00:10.710> and

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
disconnect the battery on the car and

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.160 
disconnect the battery on the car and
there's<00:00:12.059> a<00:00:12.150> lot<00:00:12.300> of<00:00:12.330> important<00:00:12.750> reasons<00:00:12.900> the

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
there's a lot of important reasons the

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.250 
there's a lot of important reasons the
obvious<00:00:13.559> ones<00:00:13.799> are<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.750> time<00:00:15.750> on<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.049> clock

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
obvious ones are the time on the clock

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.359 
obvious ones are the time on the clock
on<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.619> radio<00:00:16.920> there's<00:00:17.789> also<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:19.220> presets<00:00:20.220> on

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
on the radio there's also the presets on

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.400 
on the radio there's also the presets on
the<00:00:20.460> radio<00:00:20.760> but<00:00:21.720> there<00:00:21.840> are<00:00:21.930> a<00:00:21.990> lot<00:00:22.109> of<00:00:22.140> less

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
the radio but there are a lot of less

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.040 
the radio but there are a lot of less
obvious<00:00:22.800> reasons<00:00:23.100> that<00:00:23.189> we<00:00:23.250> want<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.460> do<00:00:23.609> this

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
obvious reasons that we want to do this

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.089 
obvious reasons that we want to do this
there's<00:00:25.050> a<00:00:25.080> lot<00:00:25.230> of<00:00:25.320> memory<00:00:25.650> in<00:00:25.740> each<00:00:25.859> of<00:00:26.010> the

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
there's a lot of memory in each of the

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.920 
there's a lot of memory in each of the
computers<00:00:26.340> that<00:00:26.519> is<00:00:26.760> learned<00:00:27.029> over<00:00:27.330> time<00:00:27.359> such

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
computers that is learned over time such

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.580 
computers that is learned over time such
as<00:00:28.170> trouble<00:00:28.800> codes<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:30.320> freeze<00:00:31.320> frame<00:00:31.560> data

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
as trouble codes and freeze frame data

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.630 
as trouble codes and freeze frame data
and<00:00:32.279> monitors<00:00:32.940> that<00:00:33.090> have<00:00:33.149> passed<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:34.640> maybe

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
and monitors that have passed and maybe

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.130 
and monitors that have passed and maybe
more<00:00:35.880> serious<00:00:36.239> issue<00:00:36.420> is<00:00:36.719> if<00:00:36.870> you<00:00:36.989> have<00:00:37.110> a

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
more serious issue is if you have a

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.930 
more serious issue is if you have a
radio<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:37.860> lot<00:00:37.980> of<00:00:38.010> cars<00:00:38.309> if<00:00:38.489> we<00:00:38.579> disconnect

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
radio and a lot of cars if we disconnect

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.280 
radio and a lot of cars if we disconnect
the<00:00:39.030> battery<00:00:39.300> that<00:00:39.390> radio<00:00:39.719> is<00:00:39.780> locked<00:00:40.050> out

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
the battery that radio is locked out

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.020 
the battery that radio is locked out
until<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:40.890> get<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.070> code<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.520> reset<00:00:41.850> that

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
until you get a code to reset that

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.660 
until you get a code to reset that
Medoff<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.600> cost<00:00:42.809> money<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.170> takes<00:00:43.440> time<00:00:43.680> so

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
Medoff and cost money and takes time so

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.760 
Medoff and cost money and takes time so
whenever<00:00:44.940> you<00:00:45.210> disconnect<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.719> battery<00:00:46.079> you're

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
whenever you disconnect a battery you're

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.340 
whenever you disconnect a battery you're
best<00:00:47.010> off<00:00:47.190> if<00:00:47.399> you<00:00:47.489> use<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.640> memory<00:00:47.910> saver<00:00:48.350> so

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
best off if you use a memory saver so

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.880 
best off if you use a memory saver so
let's<00:00:49.739> take<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:49.890> look<00:00:50.070> at<00:00:50.190> this<00:00:50.280> right<00:00:50.430> now<00:00:51.890> the

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
let's take a look at this right now the

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.000 
let's take a look at this right now the
clock<00:00:53.129> says<00:00:55.250> that<00:00:56.250> it<00:00:56.610> is<00:00:57.170> 1:55<00:00:58.170> right<00:00:58.620> now<00:00:58.770> and

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
clock says that it is 1:55 right now and

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.549 
clock says that it is 1:55 right now and
so<00:00:59.219> if<00:00:59.399> we<00:00:59.550> do<00:00:59.699> this<00:00:59.789> right<00:01:00.030> that<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.690> memory

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
so if we do this right that the memory

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.020 
so if we do this right that the memory
won't<00:01:01.739> be<00:01:01.859> reset<00:01:02.600> we'll<00:01:03.600> turn<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.870> key<00:01:04.019> off

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
won't be reset we'll turn the key off

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.550 
won't be reset we'll turn the key off
we've<00:01:06.030> grabbed<00:01:06.180> this<00:01:06.299> memory<00:01:06.659> saver<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.380> has<00:01:07.530> a

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
we've grabbed this memory saver it has a

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.130 
we've grabbed this memory saver it has a
cigarette<00:01:07.830> lighter<00:01:08.189> on<00:01:09.090> one<00:01:09.270> end<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.810> it<00:01:09.960> has

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
cigarette lighter on one end and it has

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.200 
cigarette lighter on one end and it has
a<00:01:10.439> nobody<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.220> connector<00:01:11.670> on<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.820> other<00:01:11.909> end

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
a nobody to connector on the other end

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.320 
a nobody to connector on the other end
and<00:01:12.619> to<00:01:13.619> make<00:01:13.770> sure<00:01:13.890> this<00:01:14.010> works<00:01:14.250> we<00:01:15.090> look<00:01:15.240> at

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
and to make sure this works we look at

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.609 
and to make sure this works we look at
the<00:01:15.420> little<00:01:15.630> LED<00:01:15.810> on<00:01:16.229> here

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
the little LED on here

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.630 
the little LED on here
I<00:01:16.650> put<00:01:17.549> this<00:01:17.640> into<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.970> car<00:01:19.040> not<00:01:20.040> LED<00:01:20.460> should

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
I put this into the car not LED should

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.260 
I put this into the car not LED should
light<00:01:20.790> up<00:01:22.430> that<00:01:23.430> shows<00:01:23.670> us<00:01:23.850> that<00:01:23.880> we've<00:01:24.119> got

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
light up that shows us that we've got

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.899 
light up that shows us that we've got
power<00:01:24.509> that<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.439> obd2<00:01:26.070> connector<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.820> then

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
power that the obd2 connector and then

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.609 
power that the obd2 connector and then
we're<00:01:27.000> taken<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.420> car<00:01:27.630> then<00:01:28.229> I<00:01:28.350> pull<00:01:28.530> it

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
we're taken to the car then I pull it

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.740 
we're taken to the car then I pull it
out<00:01:28.710> of<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.890> car<00:01:29.240> I'll<00:01:30.240> bring<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:30.570> over<00:01:30.630> here

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
out of the car I'll bring it over here

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.420 
out of the car I'll bring it over here
and<00:01:31.049> this<00:01:31.320> is<00:01:31.380> going<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.829> be<00:01:31.920> our<00:01:32.009> power<00:01:32.189> supply

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
and this is going to be our power supply

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.460 
and this is going to be our power supply
that's<00:01:33.060> all<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.299> memory<00:01:33.479> saver<00:01:33.840> is<00:01:34.049> is<00:01:34.229> just<00:01:34.409> a

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
that's all a memory saver is is just a

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.950 
that's all a memory saver is is just a
backup<00:01:34.680> battery<00:01:35.070> I<00:01:35.540> want<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.630> connect<00:01:36.840> this

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
backup battery I want to connect this

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.569 
backup battery I want to connect this
here<00:01:37.170> make<00:01:37.380> sure<00:01:37.530> that<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.829> LED<00:01:38.430> will<00:01:38.549> light

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
here make sure that the LED will light

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.620 
here make sure that the LED will light
up<00:01:38.820> as<00:01:38.939> well<00:01:39.409> and<00:01:40.409> it<00:01:40.530> does<00:01:41.329> there's<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.420> fuse

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
up as well and it does there's a fuse

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.510 
up as well and it does there's a fuse
inside<00:01:42.810> of<00:01:43.049> here<00:01:43.170> if<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.350> fuse<00:01:43.560> is<00:01:43.680> blown<00:01:43.799> that

inside of here if the fuse is blown that

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.819 
inside of here if the fuse is blown that
won't<00:01:44.700> light<00:01:44.850> up<00:01:44.909> or<00:01:45.329> if<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.780> wire<00:01:45.960> is<00:01:45.990> bad<00:01:46.500> or

right<00:01:53.310> I<00:01:53.340> can't<00:01:53.610> plug<00:01:53.790> them<00:01:53.909> in<00:01:54.030> at<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.180> same

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
right I can't plug them in at the same

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.670 
right I can't plug them in at the same
time<00:01:54.540> I've<00:01:54.659> got<00:01:54.720> to<00:01:54.869> plug<00:01:54.990> in<00:01:55.140> one<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.619> then

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
time I've got to plug in one and then

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.810 
time I've got to plug in one and then
disconnect<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.250> plug<00:01:56.520> in<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.729> other

shows<00:01:57.659> that<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.990> cable<00:01:58.350> is<00:01:58.409> good<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:58.770> we've

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
shows that the cable is good and we've

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.190 
shows that the cable is good and we've
got<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.219> voltage<00:01:59.549> on<00:01:59.670> either<00:01:59.850> end<00:02:00.119> so<00:02:00.329> now<00:02:01.140> we

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
got the voltage on either end so now we

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:10.620 
got the voltage on either end so now we
can<00:02:01.350> connect<00:02:01.619> this

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.760 

connected<00:02:11.630> here<00:02:11.810> so<00:02:11.990> now<00:02:12.140> the<00:02:12.200> car<00:02:12.440> has<00:02:12.470> two

problems in some cases now if we've done

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.800 
problems in some cases now if we've done
this<00:02:40.280> right<00:02:40.550> we'll<00:02:41.120> be<00:02:41.240> able<00:02:41.300> to<00:02:41.420> reconnect

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
this right we'll be able to reconnect

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.190 
this right we'll be able to reconnect

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
have been lost of course just a reminder

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.240 
have been lost of course just a reminder
that<00:02:53.780> when<00:02:53.990> you<00:02:54.080> disconnect<00:02:54.260> the<00:02:54.560> battery

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
that when you disconnect the battery

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.530 
that when you disconnect the battery
you<00:02:55.640> should<00:02:55.790> always<00:02:55.970> disconnect<00:02:56.480> the

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
you should always disconnect the

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.780 
you should always disconnect the
negative<00:02:56.720> cables<00:02:57.260> first<00:02:57.440> the<00:02:58.310> reason<00:02:58.610> for

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
negative cables first the reason for

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.150 
negative cables first the reason for
that<00:02:58.850> is<00:02:59.150> as<00:02:59.780> I<00:03:00.020> am<00:03:00.080> this<00:03:00.380> connections<00:03:00.830> cable

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
that is as I am this connections cable

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.560 
that is as I am this connections cable
with<00:03:01.280> my<00:03:01.370> wrench<00:03:01.670> were<00:03:01.850> too<00:03:01.970> short<00:03:02.209> against

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
with my wrench were too short against

the metal on the car against anything

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.670 
the metal on the car against anything
that's<00:03:04.459> metal<00:03:05.170> it<00:03:06.170> won't<00:03:06.350> do<00:03:06.500> anything

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
that's metal it won't do anything

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.940 
that's metal it won't do anything
because<00:03:06.890> it's<00:03:07.160> all<00:03:07.340> getting<00:03:08.239> to<00:03:08.330> the<00:03:08.420> ground

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
because it's all getting to the ground

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.290 
because it's all getting to the ground
however<00:03:09.950> if<00:03:10.220> I<00:03:10.310> started<00:03:10.640> to<00:03:10.670> disconnect<00:03:11.150> the

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
however if I started to disconnect the

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.479 
however if I started to disconnect the

positive battery cable first and my

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:14.949 
positive battery cable first and my
wrench<00:03:13.730> were<00:03:13.880> too<00:03:14.000> short<00:03:14.239> against<00:03:14.600> metal

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
wrench were too short against metal

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:16.449 
wrench were too short against metal
while<00:03:15.080> I<00:03:15.110> was<00:03:15.290> doing<00:03:15.470> that<00:03:15.590> I<00:03:15.650> would<00:03:15.860> create<00:03:16.340> a

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
while I was doing that I would create a

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.530 
while I was doing that I would create a
short-circuit<00:03:16.820> and<00:03:17.390> burn<00:03:17.810> or<00:03:18.019> melt<00:03:18.050> something

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
short-circuit and burn or melt something

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.030 
short-circuit and burn or melt something
okay<00:03:20.570> let's<00:03:20.810> go<00:03:20.900> see<00:03:21.080> how<00:03:21.200> successful<00:03:21.769> we<00:03:21.860> were

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:29.229 

now<00:03:25.040> pull<00:03:25.280> the<00:03:25.400> memory<00:03:25.580> saver<00:03:25.880> cable<00:03:26.720> out<00:03:28.239> and

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
now pull the memory saver cable out and

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.820 
now pull the memory saver cable out and
forget<00:03:29.510> this<00:03:29.600> Ryan<00:03:29.900> o'clock<00:03:30.320> sugar<00:03:30.709> needed

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
forget this Ryan o'clock sugar needed

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.960 
forget this Ryan o'clock sugar needed
just<00:03:33.830> a<00:03:33.920> few<00:03:34.100> minutes<00:03:34.370> later<00:03:34.550> than<00:03:34.730> it<00:03:34.820> was

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
just a few minutes later than it was

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.670 
just a few minutes later than it was
earlier

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.930 

1:57<00:03:39.680> we<00:03:39.890> were<00:03:39.950> successful<00:03:40.250> so<00:03:40.610> that's<00:03:40.760> how

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
1:57 we were successful so that's how

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.310 
1:57 we were successful so that's how
you<00:03:41.000> keep<00:03:41.239> the<00:03:41.390> memory<00:03:41.690> in<00:03:41.780> the<00:03:41.840> car<00:03:42.019> when<00:03:42.230> you

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320 
you keep the memory in the car when you

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.190 
you keep the memory in the car when you
disconnect<00:03:42.500> the<00:03:42.800> battery
