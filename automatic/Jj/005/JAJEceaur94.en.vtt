00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
Khorasan guard has and it's kind of

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.819 
Khorasan guard has and it's kind of
liking<00:01:40.470> a<00:01:41.180> dark<00:01:42.180> blood-red<00:01:43.049> color<00:01:43.470> really

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
liking a dark blood-red color really

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.010 
liking a dark blood-red color really
kind<00:01:44.159> of<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.340> pretty<00:01:44.610> red<00:01:44.909> car<00:01:45.149> really<00:01:45.540> liked<00:01:45.750> it

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
kind of a pretty red car really liked it

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.260 
kind of a pretty red car really liked it
which<00:01:46.829> is<00:01:47.040> one<00:01:47.399> of<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.579> reasons<00:01:47.850> why<00:01:48.000> i<00:01:48.030> wanted

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
which is one of the reasons why i wanted

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.670 
which is one of the reasons why i wanted
to<00:01:48.390> make<00:01:48.540> this<00:01:48.689> figure<00:01:48.990> because<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.290> enjoyed

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
to make this figure because I enjoyed

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.410 
to make this figure because I enjoyed
the<00:01:49.710> I<00:01:50.189> enjoy<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.939> color<00:01:51.180> on<00:01:51.509> it

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
the I enjoy the color on it

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.190 
the I enjoy the color on it
so<00:01:55.399> obviously<00:01:56.399> it's<00:01:56.729> pretty<00:01:56.820> simple<00:01:57.479> I'm<00:01:57.899> not

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
so obviously it's pretty simple I'm not

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.749 
so obviously it's pretty simple I'm not
going<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.409> go<00:01:58.500> over<00:01:58.530> articulation<00:01:59.430> anything

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
going to go over articulation anything

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.639 
going to go over articulation anything
because<00:01:59.939> if<00:02:00.030> you<00:02:00.180> know<00:02:00.479> Captain<00:02:01.020> Rex<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:01.409> know

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
because if you know Captain Rex you know

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.300 
because if you know Captain Rex you know
what<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.219> articulation<00:02:03.000> is<00:02:03.860> so<00:02:04.860> I<00:02:04.890> painted

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
what the articulation is so I painted

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.280 
what the articulation is so I painted
the<00:02:05.460> design<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:06.479> will<00:02:06.719> take<00:02:06.930> off<00:02:07.110> this

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
the design and I will take off this

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.559 
the design and I will take off this
helmet<00:02:07.619> and<00:02:08.099> I<00:02:09.000> just<00:02:09.209> gave<00:02:09.360> him<00:02:09.509> the

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
helmet and I just gave him the

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.240 
helmet and I just gave him the
sergeant's<00:02:10.110> slick<00:02:10.349> head<00:02:10.619> then

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
sergeant's slick head then

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.640 
sergeant's slick head then
never<00:02:11.460> showed<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:12.360> commander<00:02:13.170> Phil<00:02:13.380> looked

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
never showed the commander Phil looked

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.920 
never showed the commander Phil looked

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
basically the standard looking clone and

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.570 
basically the standard looking clone and
I<00:02:18.780> definitely<00:02:19.170> like<00:02:19.740> the<00:02:19.950> high-end<00:02:20.340> tight

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580

chest detail was pretty tough to get off
it<00:02:42.209> took<00:02:42.360> me<00:02:42.570> probably<00:02:42.600> about<00:02:43.340> I'd<00:02:44.340> say<00:02:44.370> about

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
it took me probably about I'd say about

his wrists and on his biceps here were a
little<00:02:55.110> bit<00:02:55.370> of<00:02:56.370> a<00:02:56.989> trick<00:02:57.989> to<00:02:58.020> get<00:02:59.180> and<00:03:00.180> also

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
little bit of a trick to get and also

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.470

his calf here all of that was pretty

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.979 
his calf here all of that was pretty
painstaking<00:03:05.880> and<00:03:06.030> I<00:03:06.090> had<00:03:06.270> to<00:03:06.390> repaint<00:03:06.780> it

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
painstaking and I had to repaint it

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.970 
painstaking and I had to repaint it
several<00:03:07.260> times<00:03:07.530> before<00:03:07.770> I<00:03:08.010> got<00:03:08.310> it<00:03:08.459> right

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
several times before I got it right

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.100 
several times before I got it right
one<00:03:11.370> of<00:03:11.489> the<00:03:11.580> tricks<00:03:11.820> that<00:03:11.940> I<00:03:12.090> do<00:03:12.270> if<00:03:12.600> you're<00:03:12.780> if

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
one of the tricks that I do if you're if

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.630 
one of the tricks that I do if you're if
you're<00:03:13.230> a<00:03:13.260> customizer<00:03:13.860> if<00:03:14.130> you're<00:03:14.280> thinking

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
you're a customizer if you're thinking

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.840 
you're a customizer if you're thinking
about<00:03:14.820> getting<00:03:15.299> into<00:03:15.570> customizing<00:03:16.080> is<00:03:16.760> one<00:03:17.760> of

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
about getting into customizing is one of

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.140 
about getting into customizing is one of
the<00:03:17.910> tricks<00:03:18.150> that<00:03:18.239> I<00:03:18.390> do<00:03:18.450> is<00:03:18.870> I<00:03:19.549> prefer<00:03:20.549> a<00:03:20.910> line

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
the tricks that I do is I prefer a line

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.240 
the tricks that I do is I prefer a line
like<00:03:21.390> this<00:03:21.600> and<00:03:21.870> on<00:03:22.080> the<00:03:22.260> wrists<00:03:22.650> here<00:03:22.920> in<00:03:23.010> here

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
like this and on the wrists here in here

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.070 
like this and on the wrists here in here
I<00:03:23.430> actually<00:03:23.880> take<00:03:24.180> a<00:03:24.209> pencil<00:03:24.570> and<00:03:24.870> just

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
I actually take a pencil and just

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.310 
I actually take a pencil and just
lightly<00:03:25.320> draw<00:03:25.709> them<00:03:25.890> on<00:03:25.980> first<00:03:26.310> because<00:03:26.549> it

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
lightly draw them on first because it

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.610 
lightly draw them on first because it
works<00:03:28.320> to<00:03:29.239> sort<00:03:30.239> of<00:03:30.420> have<00:03:31.049> a<00:03:31.080> little<00:03:31.200> guide<00:03:31.590> to

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
works to sort of have a little guide to

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.699 
works to sort of have a little guide to
to<00:03:32.280> go<00:03:32.400> by<00:03:32.580> I<00:03:32.610> did<00:03:32.910> I<00:03:33.120> did<00:03:33.450> draw<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:33.810> the<00:03:34.440> chest

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.729 
to go by I did I did draw the the chest
detail<00:03:35.160> on<00:03:35.459> as<00:03:35.610> well<00:03:35.989> beforehand<00:03:36.989> just<00:03:37.200> to

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
detail on as well beforehand just to

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.350 
detail on as well beforehand just to
have<00:03:37.890> something<00:03:38.100> to<00:03:38.250> guide<00:03:38.519> me<00:03:38.820> so<00:03:38.850> that<00:03:39.239> I'm

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
have something to guide me so that I'm

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.380 
have something to guide me so that I'm
not<00:03:39.390> kind<00:03:39.870> of<00:03:40.079> just<00:03:40.320> free<00:03:40.769> handing<00:03:41.220> it

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
not kind of just free handing it

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.229 
not kind of just free handing it
these<00:03:43.130> figures<00:03:44.130> are<00:03:44.250> way<00:03:44.400> too<00:03:44.459> small<00:03:44.790> to<00:03:44.940> do

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
these figures are way too small to do

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.030 
these figures are way too small to do
freehand<00:03:45.840> work<00:03:46.019> like<00:03:46.260> that<00:03:46.290> it's<00:03:46.620> just<00:03:46.799> too

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
freehand work like that it's just too

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.190 
freehand work like that it's just too
too<00:03:47.340> hard<00:03:47.549> last<00:03:48.480> thing<00:03:48.660> I<00:03:48.720> want<00:03:48.840> to<00:03:48.930> talk<00:03:49.079> about
