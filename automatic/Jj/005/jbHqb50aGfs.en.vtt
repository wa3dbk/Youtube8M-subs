00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 if she goes up on the evangelical bench

 I think I 'll leave it just went to 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:09.650
 First time Gilberto and I 'm going to see 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:15.870
 if she manages to climb one live in 38 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:18.720
 it was wet, look, the league is just 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:26.779
 gilberto can take the goalkeeper to shoot 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:35.489
 to get him to play live live 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:40.710
 let gilberto calm her down and gilberto knows 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:43.379
 now the way of the way to calm her 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:49.110
 what he said is an animal people go 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:59.940
 having an animal that pulls the couch only pays 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:01:02.820
 by her side behind she comes here looks 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.280
 Look at my god 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.380
 Take it is an animal, there's no way it's leaving. 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.710
 on the gilberto sofa is no longer left to 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:17.400
 willingness to leave the 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:20.759
 WILL IS LIVE 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.920
 soon everything is new then the 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.450
 As the table comes a new thing 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.400
 that it can only be the same did not have the 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.700
 even if the table can be even 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:34.470
 It is made after the state provides access and was 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:36.630
 the same tablecloth was still looking 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.720
 Why do I live the microphone for 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.159
 Me, the phone is that everything for her was the 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.100
 wheel noise from here 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.960
 quickly talking veterinarian 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.640
 veterinary tac camera please 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.369
 the doctor said it was the noise of the wheel 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.259
 because in general so they feel 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.509
 fear of something first greater than 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.729
 she's not even a different thing and I've never seen 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.219
 a table is in front of her at a table 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.869
 alone moving is a scare to 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.280
 she does not think it's very strange to stay 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.979
 I think it may have been really 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.140
 the table today a centenary that came a 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.819
 object she is afraid of in 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.039
 another thing that it is important that 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.000
 Roberto said this is mine. 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.880
 seeing 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.400
 until a year and michel is a year is ronnie 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.980
 lane six months to one year and six months 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.050
 is a baby people and she is totally 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.360
 everything domestic then means any 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.170
 movement for her, all this here is a 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.790
 novelty 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.560
 everything in the game is why everything has to 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.580
 Being too slow has to be all too much. 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.680
 slowly 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.350
 to and we have to always think one 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.830
 just before the vision she is having 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.810
 huh 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.810
 so for example now is the time 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.370
 to be relaxed from her being quiet 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.930
 It's what she likes when she's at home. 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.760
 the business up at that table who she 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.140
 came to quote then served the people 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.970
 let her will 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.410
 except that this table suddenly began to 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.840
 walking alone or with the wheels 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.790
 to her it was an animal this is another 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.590
 bug I do not know then leave me 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.360
 then she tries to move away 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.190
 calm and calm so she has to let 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.200
 was concerned that she does what she 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.000
 I want and whatever time she wants 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.830
 so she does not have this business of 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.080
 wanting to force you will have to do it 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.800
 then there have to respect 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.800
 stay
