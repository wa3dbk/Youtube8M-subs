00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
a little bit of how versatile it was

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.650

this morning and it held up really

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.980 
this morning and it held up really
really<00:00:25.530> well<00:00:26.060> we<00:00:27.060> we<00:00:27.420> had<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:27.570> bit<00:00:27.690> of<00:00:27.780> powder

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
really well we we had a bit of powder

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.480 
really well we we had a bit of powder
this<00:00:28.200> morning<00:00:28.530> so<00:00:28.770> we<00:00:29.010> were<00:00:29.100> hitting<00:00:29.250> a<00:00:29.369> few

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
this morning so we were hitting a few

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.930 
this morning so we were hitting a few
lines<00:00:29.700> in<00:00:29.850> that<00:00:30.030> and<00:00:30.210> it<00:00:30.750> floated<00:00:31.230> really<00:00:31.710> nice

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:31.940 
lines in that and it floated really nice

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.970 
lines in that and it floated really nice
so<00:00:32.940> easy<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.390> turn<00:00:33.570> it<00:00:33.840> was<00:00:33.960> stiff<00:00:34.260> enough<00:00:34.379> and

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
so easy to turn it was stiff enough and

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.160 
so easy to turn it was stiff enough and
it's<00:00:35.280> got<00:00:35.430> really<00:00:35.789> light<00:00:36.030> tip<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.539> tail<00:00:36.690> so

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
it's got really light tip and tail so

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.809 
it's got really light tip and tail so
that<00:00:37.710> really<00:00:37.980> helps<00:00:38.370> with<00:00:38.429> the<00:00:38.489> float<00:00:38.789> and

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:38.819 
that really helps with the float and

00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:41.599 
that really helps with the float and
your<00:00:39.089> turn<00:00:39.569> initiation<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:40.679> that<00:00:40.980> combined

00:00:41.599 --> 00:00:41.609 
your turn initiation and that combined

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:45.139 
your turn initiation and that combined
with<00:00:42.140> with<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.350> camera<00:00:43.859> profile<00:00:44.309> which<00:00:44.940> is<00:00:45.120> a

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149

really mellow rocker in the middle here
between<00:00:47.159> the<00:00:47.429> bindings<00:00:47.609> and<00:00:48.210> then<00:00:48.329> as<00:00:48.479> you<00:00:48.510> get

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
between the bindings and then as you get

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.479 
between the bindings and then as you get
out<00:00:48.839> to<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.019> tip<00:00:49.229> and<00:00:49.289> tail<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.920> rocker<00:00:50.190> just

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
out to the tip and tail the rocker just

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.879 
out to the tip and tail the rocker just
increases<00:00:51.059> slightly<00:00:51.300> which<00:00:52.079> it<00:00:52.440> just<00:00:52.499> really

on it nicely and know exactly what

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.359 
on it nicely and know exactly what
you're<00:01:24.719> getting<00:01:24.960> from<00:01:25.079> it<00:01:25.189> it's<00:01:26.189> got

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
you're getting from it it's got

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.029 
you're getting from it it's got
armadillo<00:01:26.939> plates<00:01:27.240> which<00:01:27.689> are<00:01:27.960> insert<00:01:28.740> plates

00:01:29.029 --> 00:01:29.039 
armadillo plates which are insert plates

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:31.039 
armadillo plates which are insert plates
underneath<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.759> bindings<00:01:29.909> which<00:01:30.659> pretty

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
underneath the bindings which pretty

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.929 
underneath the bindings which pretty
much<00:01:31.140> means<00:01:31.439> it's<00:01:31.710> impossible<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.340> snap<00:01:32.729> a

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
much means it's impossible to snap a

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.580 
much means it's impossible to snap a
stepchild<00:01:33.390> board<00:01:33.689> because<00:01:33.899> it<00:01:34.079> just<00:01:34.170> toughens

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
stepchild board because it just toughens

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.709 
stepchild board because it just toughens
up<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.859> core<00:01:35.039> there<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.909> you<00:01:36.210> get<00:01:36.359> two<00:01:36.539> year

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:36.719 
up the core there and you get two year

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:38.029 
up the core there and you get two year
warranty<00:01:36.750> on<00:01:37.079> stepchild<00:01:37.530> board<00:01:37.799> so<00:01:38.009> you

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:38.039 
warranty on stepchild board so you

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:39.200 
warranty on stepchild board so you
haven't<00:01:38.369> got<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.490> lot<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.700> worry<00:01:38.850> about<00:01:38.909> there

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
haven't got a lot to worry about there

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.959 
haven't got a lot to worry about there
anyway<00:01:39.890> it's<00:01:40.890> designed<00:01:41.159> for<00:01:41.579> sort<00:01:41.850> of

anyway it's designed for sort of

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:45.109 
anyway it's designed for sort of
beginner<00:01:42.539> intermediate<00:01:43.399> riders<00:01:44.399> who<00:01:44.609> were
