my<00:02:01.700> blank<00:02:01.970> page<00:02:02.180> if<00:02:02.420> i<00:02:02.480> were<00:02:02.600> to<00:02:02.690> export<00:02:03.110> this

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
my blank page if i were to export this

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.020 
my blank page if i were to export this
PDF<00:02:03.530> right<00:02:03.800> now<00:02:03.950> that's<00:02:04.520> all<00:02:04.670> i<00:02:04.730> would<00:02:04.910> have

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
PDF right now that's all i would have

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.390 
PDF right now that's all i would have
however<00:02:05.930> i<00:02:06.110> don't<00:02:06.290> want<00:02:06.500> just<00:02:06.620> a<00:02:06.740> blank<00:02:06.920> page<00:02:07.130> i

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
however i don't want just a blank page i

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.100 
however i don't want just a blank page i
need<00:02:07.520> to<00:02:07.790> see<00:02:08.479> all<00:02:08.660> of<00:02:09.140> my<00:02:09.410> boxes<00:02:09.950> so<00:02:11.050> since<00:02:12.050> my

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
need to see all of my boxes so since my

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.780 
need to see all of my boxes so since my
panels<00:02:12.560> are<00:02:12.710> important<00:02:13.070> to<00:02:13.130> me<00:02:13.250> and<00:02:13.430> they<00:02:13.610> need

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
panels are important to me and they need

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.670 
panels are important to me and they need
outlines<00:02:14.270> i'm<00:02:14.540> going<00:02:14.990> to<00:02:15.050> outline<00:02:15.350> them<00:02:15.530> all

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
outlines i'm going to outline them all

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.260 
outlines i'm going to outline them all
and<00:02:15.890> i<00:02:15.980> want<00:02:16.160> the<00:02:16.250> exact<00:02:16.550> same<00:02:16.730> outline<00:02:17.060> on

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
and i want the exact same outline on

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:18.460 
and i want the exact same outline on
them<00:02:17.450> because<00:02:17.630> i'm<00:02:17.840> going<00:02:17.959> to<00:02:18.020> be<00:02:18.110> tracing

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
them because i'm going to be tracing

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.500 
them because i'm going to be tracing
this<00:02:18.560> anyway<00:02:18.920> so<00:02:18.980> i<00:02:19.190> need<00:02:19.459> it<00:02:19.580> to<00:02:19.610> be<00:02:19.760> a<00:02:19.970> bit<00:02:20.480> of

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
width and the height this increases in

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.830 
width and the height this increases in
decrease<00:02:39.020> by<00:02:39.290> percentages<00:02:40.180> this<00:02:41.180> allows<00:02:41.660> you

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
decrease by percentages this allows you

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.720 
decrease by percentages this allows you
to<00:02:41.959> shear<00:02:42.709> or<00:02:43.010> or<00:02:43.790> rotate<00:02:45.190> this<00:02:46.190> is<00:02:46.340> sheer<00:02:46.610> at

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
to shear or or rotate this is sheer at

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.050 
to shear or or rotate this is sheer at
the<00:02:46.820> bottom<00:02:47.090> and<00:02:47.770> this<00:02:48.770> is<00:02:49.010> rotate<00:02:49.850> on<00:02:49.940> an

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
the bottom and this is rotate on an

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.720 
the bottom and this is rotate on an
angle<00:02:50.390> these<00:02:51.140> are<00:02:51.410> my<00:02:51.470> rotate<00:02:52.100> tools<00:02:52.340> as<00:02:52.580> well

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
angle these are my rotate tools as well

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.259 
angle these are my rotate tools as well
my<00:02:53.420> flip<00:02:53.720> tools<00:02:54.550> this<00:02:55.550> shows<00:02:55.910> you<00:02:56.030> exactly

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
my flip tools this shows you exactly

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:58.600 
my flip tools this shows you exactly
where<00:02:56.840> your<00:02:57.019> pages<00:02:57.410> so<00:02:57.620> it's<00:02:57.769> vertical<00:02:58.040> if<00:02:58.489> I

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
where your pages so it's vertical if I

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.310 
where your pages so it's vertical if I
were<00:02:58.700> to<00:02:58.790> rotate<00:02:58.940> these<00:02:59.330> you'll<00:02:59.780> see<00:02:59.989> that<00:03:00.140> my

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
were to rotate these you'll see that my

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.970 
were to rotate these you'll see that my
piece<00:03:00.590> witches<00:03:00.980> rotate<00:03:01.700> it<00:03:01.820> back<00:03:02.830> same<00:03:03.830> with

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
piece witches rotate it back same with

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.890 
piece witches rotate it back same with
mirror<00:03:04.450> upside<00:03:05.450> down<00:03:05.630> backwards<00:03:07.720> back<00:03:08.720> to

mirror upside down backwards back to

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.270 
mirror upside down backwards back to
right<00:03:09.050> side<00:03:09.230> up<00:03:09.670> okay<00:03:10.670> um<00:03:11.350> so<00:03:12.350> this<00:03:12.620> is<00:03:12.739> my<00:03:12.860> line

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
right side up okay um so this is my line

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.949 
right side up okay um so this is my line
options<00:03:13.670> I<00:03:13.760> want<00:03:13.940> to<00:03:14.000> line<00:03:14.209> around<00:03:14.450> life<00:03:14.660> my

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
options I want to line around life my
