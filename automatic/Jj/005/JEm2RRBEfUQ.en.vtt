giggles we were seeing what the ISO

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.429 
giggles we were seeing what the ISO
capabilities<00:00:28.770> were<00:00:29.399> I'm<00:00:30.239> exposing<00:00:31.110> for<00:00:31.349> the

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
capabilities were I'm exposing for the

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.770 
capabilities were I'm exposing for the
scene<00:00:31.680> and<00:00:31.980> I<00:00:32.730> put<00:00:33.000> it<00:00:33.090> at<00:00:33.180> four<00:00:33.329> thousand<00:00:33.660> eyes

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
scene and I put it at four thousand eyes

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.470 
scene and I put it at four thousand eyes
so<00:00:33.989> much<00:00:34.110> on<00:00:34.290> any<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.430> recent<00:00:35.640> Sony's<00:00:36.270> is

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
so much on any of the recent Sony's is

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.650

this<00:01:39.800> camera<00:01:40.400> is<00:01:40.610> not<00:01:41.420> only<00:01:41.570> picking<00:01:41.900> up<00:01:42.110> all

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
this camera is not only picking up all

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.730 
this camera is not only picking up all
that<00:01:43.330> behind<00:01:44.330> her<00:01:44.570> but<00:01:45.380> coming<00:01:46.310> up

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
that behind her but coming up

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.219 
that behind her but coming up
I<00:01:47.799> don't<00:01:48.430> it's<00:01:48.610> picking<00:01:49.030> up<00:01:49.150> enough<00:01:49.540> light<00:01:49.840> to

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
I don't it's picking up enough light to

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.030 
I don't it's picking up enough light to
light<00:01:50.979> her<00:01:51.340> face

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:59.859 

that<00:01:54.580> is<00:01:54.760> indeed<00:01:55.120> ridiculous

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.210 

with<00:02:00.200> a<00:02:00.289> lot<00:02:00.439> on<00:02:00.560> me<00:02:00.679> real<00:02:00.829> quick

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.920 

so<00:02:03.790> this<00:02:03.970> will<00:02:04.120> be<00:02:04.210> a<00:02:04.240> very<00:02:04.450> short<00:02:04.540> video

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
so this will be a very short video

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.230 
so this will be a very short video
that's<00:02:05.440> my<00:02:05.680> first<00:02:05.920> test<00:02:06.220> and<00:02:06.400> my<00:02:06.760> first<00:02:06.970> foray

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
that's my first test and my first foray

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.810 
that's my first test and my first foray
into<00:02:07.390> high<00:02:07.840> ISO<00:02:08.380> at<00:02:08.470> a<00:02:08.590> seminar<00:02:09.010> to<00:02:09.190> now<00:02:09.790> I

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:09.820 
into high ISO at a seminar to now I

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.360 
into high ISO at a seminar to now I
really<00:02:10.270> can't<00:02:10.479> wait<00:02:10.690> to<00:02:10.750> see<00:02:11.470> what<00:02:12.130> this<00:02:12.190> bad

really can't wait to see what this bad

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.610 
really can't wait to see what this bad
boy<00:02:12.610> can<00:02:12.640> do<00:02:12.970> but<00:02:13.150> I<00:02:13.180> thought<00:02:13.420> I<00:02:13.450> would<00:02:13.780> share

boy can do but I thought I would share
that<00:02:14.680> and<00:02:15.160> I<00:02:15.550> hope<00:02:15.730> it<00:02:15.880> helps<00:02:16.830> so<00:02:17.830> until<00:02:18.040> next
