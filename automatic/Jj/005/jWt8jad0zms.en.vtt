 remove the film to remove the 

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:29.980
 so the film is put 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:33.629
 on your fingernail you 'll need a little cup 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:38.099
 with clean water and cotton 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:41.290
 there to make a little piece of cotton 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:43.239

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.359
 put that part down here where 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:48.359
 There is more red in here. 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:52.019

00:03:48.359 --> 00:04:00.910

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.930
 a few minutes here 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:14.169
 according to people what will happen in l 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:16.599
 the water will loosen the glue they have between 

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:18.609

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:22.000

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:23.789

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.560
 movie 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:31.479
 Rain is already good 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:32.229
 O I put it and it looks like the hour 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:36.610
 that I shoot 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:42.159
 It's here on the cotton sheet. 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:45.970

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:49.900
 film is now how does it 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:52.000
 the whole burr with acetone or 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:55.360
 with enamel remover that you 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:02.370
 It's okay, I'll make it here. 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:02.370
 you see banana oil 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:11.560
 It's the same scheme as if you had 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:22.650
 cleaning the nail is not 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:22.650
 I'll show you guys up. 

00:05:36.239 --> 00:05:41.649
 Careful, what are you doing? What? 

00:05:39.309 --> 00:05:45.610
 going to happen is when you put 

00:05:41.649 --> 00:05:49.409
 what happens to acetone access back 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:53.769
 He kind of melts this movie. 

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:56.169
 It 's holding too, so you put 

00:05:53.769 --> 00:06:01.029

00:05:56.169 --> 00:06:08.919
 pushing it up here is her 

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:14.619
 It's going to cut the film you're taking. 

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:16.929
 the monies are seeing you do it in 

00:06:14.619 --> 00:06:20.019
 all the way until I've finished cleaning 

00:06:16.929 --> 00:06:22.089
 The only perfect little corner on the nail is 

00:06:20.019 --> 00:06:24.129
 a very thin film then you go 

00:06:22.089 --> 00:06:25.179
 see that it will be easy to clean and she 

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:29.110
 stay on the nail 

00:06:25.179 --> 00:06:30.879
 But to be able to fly, I'll use the 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:33.849
 you will see that it gives a 

00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:36.339
 super beautiful glow and that she will not 

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:37.929
 To leave, it's going to stick together. 

00:06:36.339 --> 00:06:44.169
 it's plenty of time no matter what you 

00:06:37.929 --> 00:06:47.169
 do now let's go to the part of iter 

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:49.089
 This is the cry, they will do the opposite. 

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:51.989
 I will spend the varnish that will play 

00:06:49.089 --> 00:06:51.989

00:06:52.319 --> 00:07:07.259

00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:07.259

00:07:21.219 --> 00:07:26.259
