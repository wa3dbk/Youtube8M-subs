the powder to set the concealer so the
first<00:02:10.590> thing<00:02:10.649> i<00:02:10.800> recommend<00:02:11.280> you<00:02:11.370> apply<00:02:11.730> is<00:02:11.790> the

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
first thing i recommend you apply is the

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.470 
first thing i recommend you apply is the
under-eye<00:02:13.530> moisturizing<00:02:14.370> cream<00:02:14.610> and<00:02:14.879> i

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
under-eye moisturizing cream and i

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.820 
under-eye moisturizing cream and i
recommend<00:02:15.750> you<00:02:15.959> using<00:02:16.140> your<00:02:16.349> ring<00:02:16.650> finger

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
recommend you using your ring finger

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.550 
recommend you using your ring finger
because<00:02:17.400> it's<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:18.120> weakest<00:02:18.480> finger<00:02:18.660> and<00:02:19.080> it

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
because it's the weakest finger and it

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.520 
because it's the weakest finger and it
won't<00:02:19.739> cause<00:02:19.950> many<00:02:20.250> wrinkles<00:02:20.459> underneath

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
won't cause many wrinkles underneath

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.660 
won't cause many wrinkles underneath
then<00:02:22.530> you're<00:02:22.680> going<00:02:22.770> to<00:02:22.830> use<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.190> small<00:02:23.459> brush

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
then you're going to use the small brush

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.740 
then you're going to use the small brush
to<00:02:24.120> apply<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.930> corrector<00:02:25.560> first<00:02:25.800> and<00:02:26.750> just

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:10.990 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:16.750

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.190
