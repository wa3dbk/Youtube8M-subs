00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
but both of them should be lapped for

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.460 
but both of them should be lapped for
double<00:01:20.640> protection<00:01:20.870> so<00:01:21.870> again<00:01:22.200> you're<00:01:22.409> gonna

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
double protection so again you're gonna

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.910 
double protection so again you're gonna
see<00:01:22.740> problems<00:01:23.190> like<00:01:23.370> this<00:01:23.700> don't<00:01:24.540> assume<00:01:25.170> that

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
see problems like this don't assume that

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.100 
see problems like this don't assume that
it's<00:01:25.980> from<00:01:26.550> something<00:01:27.030> else<00:01:27.210> always<00:01:27.900> look

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
it's from something else always look

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.090 
it's from something else always look
into<00:01:30.020> you<00:01:31.020> know<00:01:31.110> every<00:01:31.409> avenue<00:01:31.830> you<00:01:31.950> can

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
into you know every avenue you can

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.070 
into you know every avenue you can
possibly<00:01:32.550> think<00:01:32.640> of<00:01:33.210> otherwise<00:01:33.690> you're<00:01:33.930> going

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
possibly think of otherwise you're going

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.610 
possibly think of otherwise you're going
to<00:01:34.200> be<00:01:34.729> doing<00:01:35.729> some<00:01:36.180> repairs<00:01:36.720> that<00:01:37.080> might<00:01:37.409> not

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:37.620 
to be doing some repairs that might not

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.750 
to be doing some repairs that might not
be<00:01:37.650> necessary<00:01:38.150> kind<00:01:39.150> of<00:01:39.240> like<00:01:39.390> repairing<00:01:40.200> the

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:40.760

be necessary kind of like repairing the
drywall<00:01:41.760> here<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.450> then<00:01:43.130> thinking<00:01:44.130> that<00:01:44.190> it's

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
drywall here and then thinking that it's

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.090 
drywall here and then thinking that it's
a<00:01:44.520> problem<00:01:44.729> in<00:01:44.940> the<00:01:45.060> bathroom<00:01:45.440> only<00:01:46.440> later<00:01:46.979> to

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
a problem in the bathroom only later to

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.420 
a problem in the bathroom only later to

find out that the roof is damaged after
you've<00:01:50.880> already<00:01:51.030> fixed<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.630> drywall<00:01:52.140> once

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
you've already fixed the drywall once

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.219 
you've already fixed the drywall once
now<00:01:52.950> you<00:01:53.010> need<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.460> fix<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:53.850> again<00:01:53.970> so<00:01:54.720> avoid

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
now you need to fix it again so avoid

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.560 
now you need to fix it again so avoid
that<00:01:55.409> from<00:01:55.620> happening<00:01:55.890> by<00:01:56.670> doing<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.299> little

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
that from happening by doing a little

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.760 
that from happening by doing a little
research
