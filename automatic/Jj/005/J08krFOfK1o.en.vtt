 perfect an unusual preparation with 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:22.350
 oysters but believe me it's worth 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.540
 because the ale the little bit of smoked 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.270
 really changes them and that's how the 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.990
 we use and when they come to the table every 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.840

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.180

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.560
 medium 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:59.800
 good fun so look do not 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.890
 there is a need to prepare too much 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:05.740
 complex to do a little preparation 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.080
 usual and absolutely spectacular 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.910
 why 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:14.390
 I have rarely seen this preparation 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:17.090
 and believe me 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.380
 Believe me they will be like kings 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.380

 spectacular bivalves first miso cyrus 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.650

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:42.280

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:45.850

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:48.340
 health and finally another variety of 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:52.950
 oyster preparation that are oysters 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.950
 Smoked with lemons and hot sauce 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.849
 and to me the truth these bivalve mollusks 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:02.209
 they remind me of those times that one 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:04.879
 travels and sees the unknown and one goes 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:07.730
 trying and going knowing and the truth that 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:11.629
 is fascinating and I ask you to be encouraged 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:14.299
 to try this preparation especially 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:18.310
 If you are going to choose one, try the 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:20.349
 loved because they are really worth it 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.510
 I would love it if he were here with me 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:25.630
 so they can see the subtlety of this 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.520
 preparing a little lemon oyster 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.180
 it is not more raw for those who 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.180
 impress a little 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:36.410
 spectacular you feel the smoke in the 

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:39.860
 oyster the lemon 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:43.480
 because the rich when it is also simple 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.480
