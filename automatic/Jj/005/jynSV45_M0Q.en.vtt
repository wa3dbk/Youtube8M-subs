00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:05.520
 knowing that an advent calendar is 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.300
 used from December 1st to December 25th 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.490
 umar winger 25 15 so to do this 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.620
 either you use a pencil in late 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.379
 to make boxes rectangular to 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.660
 square of the same length and the same 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.760
 width over the whole sheet be you 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:25.410
 do it in an original way like me 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:28.170
 to get a notebook a forgiveness a 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.000
 advent calendar more original so 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.669
 to do this you take a cutter or 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.510
 a knife and you make shapes 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:48.440
 more original in your sheet of 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:53.879
 road from here I make a first here 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:55.850
 so we can observe here shaped form 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:01.010
 drop 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.010
 here we can realize others 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:18.660
 here is here I am trying to 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:18.660
 achieve a house-shaped 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:27.520
 here's what to always leave the 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:30.510
 part of the duo attached so a sale of 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:34.300
 the imaginary attached so high if we see 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:38.620
 so now how exactly do 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:46.030
 this is you take a pencil and you 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:49.660
 draw an added line as this is 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.920
 from this line you cut 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:59.440
 sand and cut the line 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:02:01.450
 a form that can be random 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:06.220
 without cutting the line what we 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:09.820
 give a shape like this so a 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:14.740
 once you have fully completed 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:18.220
 your advent calendar of 25 gas 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:21.150
 always have what you can do 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:25.840
 of course it's decorated this calendar 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:30.269
 so how is the decor either with 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:33.550
 as I have here little glitter 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:37.000
 payet mirror so we see that it reflects 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:43.209
 the light so you can decorate either 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:45.519
 with color markers or even 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.360
 other decorating ideas so that 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:50.130
 it's for you to see 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:52.360
 then once your 25 4's are made 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.269
 you take your second sheets of 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:03:00.670
 color here mans the red I place it in 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:03.209
 under my yellow leaf what he 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.209
 must do now 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:11.290
 it's you take one more item 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:14.530
 in your material which is a tube of 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:17.350
 so stick here I have glue tube like 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:20.319
 these but it can be another tube 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.540
 of glue to choose so what is that 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:26.620
 you're going to do you're going back 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:28.660
 your prison or the sheet in which 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:32.920
 woods had cut up forums and you 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:36.580
 go apply glue on the edge to 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:38.400
 about 1 cm at the edge of all the 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:46.600
 leaf 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:49.380
 if I'm doing it by train 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.380
 to apply the glue 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.730
 that's it and once these if it does not 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.820
 you just have to put this 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.350
 leaf so perfectly on the 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:06.560
 red leaf so I'm going to vote from 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:08.930
 support now you have to ask 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:15.680
 exactly so we start with the corner 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:17.360
 here is the second hot spot that 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.840
 the two corners are placed you can 

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:27.800
 ask following you of course press the 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:31.730
 edges and that's it then what you 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:33.350
 remains to be done is to take a mark of 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:36.260
 color which will be seen on the 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:41.120
 first page and each small window 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:44.720
 that you drew the numbered then 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:47.050
 it has to be numbered in the 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.050
 disorder 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:53.690
 no it's not a calendar of 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:58.130
 advent more once you and some 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:59.960
 sets and writings of numbers in this 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:03.440
 what to do is to fold back each 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:06.980
 box up and write a message or 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:09.910
 well still stuck a picture in 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:13.360
 the reserved place so for example 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:16.360
 we can write 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.360
 Hello 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:31.660
 what you can also do is 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:34.810
 you take small change such 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:39.250
 than a piece of 5 cents and you 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:42.550
 hide if inside and close with 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:44.980
 a little sticky paper on that it's 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:47.350
 with tonight the month technique that 

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:49.300
 I use when I realize but 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:50.580
 advent calendar look so this 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:54.840
 technical 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:58.240
 I realize different shapes 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:00.430
 auditions we can still see I'm going a 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:04.510
 we will see him well 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:06.930
 did not make sparks box so here 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:10.860
 we can still see other forms 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:15.850
 once we've done that we do not forget 

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:20.260
 to decorate our page as you are 

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:22.600
 wish with the material then we want 

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:26.800
 of course in box number 25 he 

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:28.930
 must note merry christmas so here I am 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:32.470
 explain how to achieve a 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:37.390
 advent calendar so 

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:39.190
 original with very little material because 

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:40.480
 often it is the inconvenience years 

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:42.280
 tutorials is that we present with 

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:45.300
 a lot of material here so it's with 

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:48.460
 little material we all have at home 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:51.640
 so I 'm telling you if it's safe to 

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:53.290
 in advance already pampered christmas and at very 

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:55.530
 soon in a next video at 

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:55.530
 meet again
