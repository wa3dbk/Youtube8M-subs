front<00:05:17.439> I'm<00:05:18.219> sorry<00:05:18.669> I<00:05:18.939> had<00:05:19.270> to<00:05:19.389> do<00:05:19.539> it<00:05:19.689> constant

00:05:20.459 --> 00:05:20.469 
front I'm sorry I had to do it constant

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:22.320 
front I'm sorry I had to do it constant
one<00:05:20.589> of<00:05:20.710> our<00:05:20.800> five<00:05:21.009> starts<00:05:21.279> killer<00:05:21.460> so<00:05:21.699> it<00:05:21.939> will

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.330 
one of our five starts killer so it will

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.179 
one of our five starts killer so it will
be<00:05:22.509> a<00:05:22.539> nice<00:05:22.689> hybrid<00:05:22.960> but<00:05:23.409> the<00:05:23.560> reason<00:05:23.979> we<00:05:24.099> don't

00:05:24.179 --> 00:05:24.189 
be a nice hybrid but the reason we don't

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:25.769 
be a nice hybrid but the reason we don't
have<00:05:24.310> wesley<00:05:24.729> slider<00:05:24.999> is<00:05:25.389> because<00:05:25.659> he's

00:05:25.769 --> 00:05:25.779 
have wesley slider is because he's

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:27.480 
have wesley slider is because he's
literally<00:05:26.289> just<00:05:26.560> been<00:05:26.740> transferred<00:05:27.189> so<00:05:27.339> look
