00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
have a look at the code there and this

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.700 
have a look at the code there and this
is<00:04:40.240> really<00:04:40.420> important<00:04:40.960> the<00:04:41.020> title<00:04:41.320> tags<00:04:41.500> one

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
is really important the title tags one

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.970 
is really important the title tags one
of<00:04:41.800> the<00:04:41.860> most<00:04:42.010> important<00:04:42.490> parts<00:04:42.820> of<00:04:43.980> search

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:44.980 
of the most important parts of search

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.070 
of the most important parts of search
engine<00:04:45.340> ranking<00:04:45.690> and<00:04:46.690> all<00:04:46.780> we're<00:04:46.930> actually

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
engine ranking and all we're actually

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.680 
engine ranking and all we're actually
doing<00:04:47.410> here<00:04:47.770> is<00:04:47.950> replacing<00:04:48.820> this<00:04:49.240> section

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
doing here is replacing this section

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.600 
doing here is replacing this section
here<00:04:49.960> which<00:04:50.320> determines<00:04:50.860> how<00:04:51.040> the<00:04:51.070> title<00:04:51.520> is

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
here which determines how the title is

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.900 
here which determines how the title is
displayed

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
displayed

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.620 
displayed
so<00:04:55.440> you<00:04:56.440> can<00:04:56.620> just<00:04:56.890> basically<00:04:57.300> where<00:04:58.300> it's<00:04:58.420> got

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
so you can just basically where it's got

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.410 
so you can just basically where it's got
title<00:04:59.110> here<00:04:59.350> all<00:04:59.530> the<00:04:59.710> way<00:04:59.770> down<00:04:59.950> to<00:05:00.090> full<00:05:01.090> /

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:33.120 
to go have a look at XML sitemaps XML
sitemaps<00:05:29.200> is<00:05:30.270> what<00:05:31.270> this<00:05:31.390> plug-in<00:05:31.690> can<00:05:32.680> do<00:05:32.890> is

sitemaps is what this plug-in can do is

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:36.660 
sitemaps is what this plug-in can do is
is<00:05:33.580> basically<00:05:34.650> make<00:05:35.650> a<00:05:35.680> file<00:05:36.100> automatically

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:36.670 
is basically make a file automatically

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.520
