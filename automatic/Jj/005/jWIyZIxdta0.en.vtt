deep<00:02:43.840> down<00:02:44.140> the<00:02:44.290> field<00:02:44.530> is<00:02:44.710> the<00:02:44.890> threat<00:02:45.190> in

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
deep down the field is the threat in

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.980 
deep down the field is the threat in
short<00:02:45.580> to<00:02:45.700> intermediate<00:02:45.850> so<00:02:46.360> I<00:02:46.390> think<00:02:46.510> you<00:02:46.870> can

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
short to intermediate so I think you can

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.080 
short to intermediate so I think you can
play<00:02:47.170> Tyvon<00:02:47.590> Branch<00:02:47.620> closer<00:02:48.550> to<00:02:48.760> the<00:02:48.850> line<00:02:48.970> of

long day for Oakland but I think their

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:25.890 
long day for Oakland but I think their
defense<00:05:24.729> will<00:05:24.880> find<00:05:25.150> a<00:05:25.270> way<00:05:25.389> to<00:05:25.449> get<00:05:25.569> pressure
