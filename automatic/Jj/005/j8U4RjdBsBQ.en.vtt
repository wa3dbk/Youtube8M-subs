00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.660
 the winter or summer solstice in the 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.820
 northern hemisphere né 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:17.240
 as you well said contrary to what 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:20.509
 many people think is not because the 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:23.630
 land is closer or more 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:25.670
 away from the sun and this is a very 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.470
 commonplace that people end up committing 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.080
 finding so right 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.720
 the orbit of the earth it is almost 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.879
 circular only lacked a little to 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:38.360
 then circulate the distance earth-sun 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:38.930
 much starts on the issue of the seasons 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.480
 of the year 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:44.600
 What really makes the difference is the 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.940
 inclination of the axis of rotation of 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.969
 with respect to your orbital plane 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.460
 then this image and also us there 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:55.219
 we have the North Pole South Pole and 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.680
 how much then does the inclination essence of 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:59.840
 land of 23 degrees and mail 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.309
 influencing in such a way that in the 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.379
 moment that we are now is that 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.630
 Let's enter June 21. 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:08.030
 Do you have there in the northern hemisphere the summer? 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.820
 first day of summer summer solstice 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.369
 and do not spheres the first day of winter 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.950
 the winter solstice the word 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:17.479
 solstice means sunshine because it is 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.840
 the moment it reaches its maximum 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:23.420
 connection there between the points you 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.399
 No, what do you have there afterwards? 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.740
 of time just walks along the line 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:30.920
 horizon in case I put the case alone 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.470
 the sunset and he goes walking and in the 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:39.380
 spring equinox is where it goes 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:42.410
 put exactly at the west cardinal point right 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.910
 and that we mean equal days because it is 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.099
 at the equinox on the first day of 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.750
 spring on the first day of autumn 

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:50.899
 you have exactly the same duration as the 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.920
 day condemnation of the night and then will 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:53.929
 passing 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.750
 you have there the summer solstice that the 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:58.819
 sun will tell me it seems to him to 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.880
 in this walk along the horizon line 

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:04.009
 so it is only stopped, that it reached more 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.610
 a connection and then it is not that our 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:10.009
 autumn it comes back, and then it goes 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.650
 exactly at the cardinal point or this 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.520
 then during the year those four 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.010
 seasons 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:19.970
 the sun makes this round trip 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.920
 where the extremes then in that sea ​​he 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.240
 its maximum distance from the point 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.000
 cardinal west 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.400
 if you want the Lecce is born you have there 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.620
 solstice sol stopped so it is called the 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.620
 solstice this incidence of lightning 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.660
 that actually fall into this is in 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.180
 Angola is 90 degrees depending on such 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.920
 attitude at last but a concentration 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.580
 greater in the sun's rays in an area 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.560
 smaller 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.700
 while at the beginning this was what you 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.920
 It's winter. 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.590
 You have a dispersion there. 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.600
 dispersing that these rays 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.720
 simple that you feel happier is not 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:57.110
 concentrated on a point in the specific case 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.870
 solstice on the first day of winter is 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.930
 where you have the longest night at night 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.430
 longest of the year at the 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.890
 while the staff at the 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:10.580
 Northern Hemisphere is having the 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:13.459
 Summer they have the nights shorter which 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:16.820
 It's technically we'd say that night 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:18.040
 longer than 20 to 21 or 21 to 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.540
 22 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.590
 basically the same thing game of the little 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.590
 second question
