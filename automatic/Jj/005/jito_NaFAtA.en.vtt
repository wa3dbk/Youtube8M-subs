sensible working move then perhaps this

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.350 
sensible working move then perhaps this

big surprise and that was Queen takes

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:05.710 
big surprise and that was Queen takes
pawn<00:06:01.050> on<00:06:01.289> f7<00:06:02.060> threatening<00:06:03.060> Queen<00:06:03.750> takes<00:06:03.960> rook

if rook takes Queen

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.350 
if rook takes Queen
which<00:06:10.050> looks<00:06:10.350> like<00:06:10.440> a<00:06:10.789> first<00:06:11.789> move<00:06:12.000> that<00:06:12.030> comes

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:12.360 
which looks like a first move that comes

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.939 
which looks like a first move that comes
to<00:06:12.539> mind<00:06:12.720> then

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:13.949 
to mind then

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:17.689 
to mind then
rook<00:06:14.819> takes<00:06:15.150> Bishop<00:06:15.360> check<00:06:15.930> and<00:06:16.259> that's<00:06:16.919> all

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:17.699 
rook takes Bishop check and that's all

00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:18.260 
rook takes Bishop check and that's all
over

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:18.270 
over

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:24.320
