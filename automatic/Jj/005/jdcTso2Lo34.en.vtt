00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
trying to use this breaks I'm really

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.630 
trying to use this breaks I'm really
surprised<00:01:46.170> that<00:01:46.500> they<00:01:46.799> use<00:01:46.979> it<00:01:47.220> right<00:01:47.400> now

it's it's a it's not hydraulic it's it's

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.020 
it's it's a it's not hydraulic it's it's
something<00:01:52.049> that's<00:01:52.229> going<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.500> change<00:01:52.909> in<00:01:53.909> the

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
something that's going to change in the

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.870 
something that's going to change in the
next<00:01:54.180> few<00:01:54.420> years<00:01:54.510> I<00:01:54.810> think<00:01:55.190> we<00:01:56.190> as<00:01:56.369> European

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
next few years I think we as European

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.609 
next few years I think we as European
riders<00:01:57.060> choose<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.560> normal<00:01:58.890> v-brakes<00:02:00.619> but

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
riders choose the normal v-brakes but

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.750 
riders choose the normal v-brakes but
the<00:02:02.340> rest<00:02:02.549> of<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.880> of<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.420> material<00:02:04.020> is<00:02:04.760> is

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:05.760 
the rest of the of the material is is

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.929 
the rest of the of the material is is
what<00:02:06.000> we<00:02:06.150> know<00:02:06.590> the<00:02:07.590> electronic<00:02:08.099> shifting<00:02:08.279> is

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:08.939 
what we know the electronic shifting is

00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:10.989 
what we know the electronic shifting is
helping<00:02:09.329> a<00:02:09.420> lot<00:02:09.539> in<00:02:09.810> every<00:02:10.379> weather

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:10.999 
helping a lot in every weather

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:14.059 
helping a lot in every weather
circumstances<00:02:11.999> so<00:02:12.180> for<00:02:13.170> us<00:02:13.200> it's<00:02:13.499> it's<00:02:13.799> an

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
circumstances so for us it's it's an

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.539 
circumstances so for us it's it's an
nothing<00:02:14.639> new<00:02:14.790> for<00:02:15.029> the<00:02:15.120> moment<00:02:16.189> but<00:02:17.189> it<00:02:17.249> works
