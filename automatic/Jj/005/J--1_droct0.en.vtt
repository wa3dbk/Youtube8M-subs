00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
the operating system looks then that

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.500 
the operating system looks then that
basically<00:03:42.160> means<00:03:42.460> I<00:03:42.640> don't<00:03:42.700> like<00:03:43.030> the<00:03:43.240> way<00:03:43.390> it

about this yesterday I am convinced that

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.110 
about this yesterday I am convinced that
diehard<00:06:04.380> BlackBerry<00:06:04.860> users<00:06:05.039> have<00:06:05.430> never<00:06:05.729> used

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120 
diehard BlackBerry users have never used

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.899 
diehard BlackBerry users have never used
another<00:06:06.840> operating<00:06:07.320> system<00:06:07.710> because<00:06:08.039> there's

00:06:08.899 --> 00:06:08.909 
another operating system because there's

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:10.820 
another operating system because there's
no<00:06:09.150> way<00:06:09.389> I<00:06:09.419> mean<00:06:09.870> if<00:06:10.020> you<00:06:10.110> compare<00:06:10.470> this<00:06:10.650> to

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:10.830 
no way I mean if you compare this to

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:14.240 
no way I mean if you compare this to
Android<00:06:11.310> to<00:06:11.759> iOS<00:06:12.180> to<00:06:12.389> Windows<00:06:12.720> Phone<00:06:12.990> it's<00:06:13.949> no

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.250 
Android to iOS to Windows Phone it's no

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:16.490 
Android to iOS to Windows Phone it's no
more<00:06:14.520> functional<00:06:15.180> than<00:06:15.210> any<00:06:15.810> of<00:06:16.080> those<00:06:16.259> other

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:16.500 
more functional than any of those other

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.589 
more functional than any of those other
operating<00:06:17.039> systems<00:06:17.099> I<00:06:17.610> just<00:06:17.909> I<00:06:18.060> just<00:06:18.120> don't

00:06:18.589 --> 00:06:18.599 
operating systems I just I just don't

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:21.170

up last night but I'm not going to i am
going<00:06:26.190> to<00:06:26.310> stick<00:06:26.580> with<00:06:26.639> this<00:06:26.970> I'm<00:06:27.630> kind<00:06:28.199> of

00:06:28.249 --> 00:06:28.259 
going to stick with this I'm kind of

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:30.230 
going to stick with this I'm kind of
accepting<00:06:29.009> like<00:06:29.190> I<00:06:29.220> said<00:06:29.580> it<00:06:29.759> is<00:06:29.789> what<00:06:30.090> it<00:06:30.210> is

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 
accepting like I said it is what it is

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.170 
accepting like I said it is what it is
its<00:06:30.960> function<00:06:31.259> over<00:06:31.650> form<00:06:32.009> it's<00:06:32.400> not<00:06:32.880> pretty

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:33.180 
its function over form it's not pretty

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.589 
its function over form it's not pretty
but<00:06:33.539> it<00:06:33.960> works<00:06:34.229> and<00:06:34.620> so<00:06:35.039> that's<00:06:35.279> I'm<00:06:35.729> trying<00:06:36.360> to

00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:36.599 
but it works and so that's I'm trying to

00:06:36.599 --> 00:06:39.040 
but it works and so that's I'm trying to
keep<00:06:36.779> an<00:06:36.900> open<00:06:37.020> mind<00:06:37.320> but<00:06:37.590> seriously<00:06:38.099> it's<00:06:38.490> not

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:39.050 
keep an open mind but seriously it's not

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:40.990 
keep an open mind but seriously it's not
any<00:06:39.169> better<00:06:39.530> than<00:06:39.889> one<00:06:40.430> of<00:06:40.520> those<00:06:40.610> operating

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:41.000 
any better than one of those operating

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.279 
any better than one of those operating
systems<00:06:41.300> and<00:06:41.360> I<00:06:41.449> guess<00:06:41.659> maybe<00:06:41.900> that's<00:06:42.020> not<00:06:42.229> the

00:06:42.279 --> 00:06:42.289 
systems and I guess maybe that's not the

00:06:42.289 --> 00:06:43.779 
systems and I guess maybe that's not the
point<00:06:42.590> maybe<00:06:42.830> it's<00:06:43.039> not<00:06:43.220> supposed<00:06:43.639> to<00:06:43.729> be

00:06:43.779 --> 00:06:43.789 
point maybe it's not supposed to be

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:45.790 
point maybe it's not supposed to be
better<00:06:44.030> maybe<00:06:44.690> it's<00:06:44.930> just<00:06:44.960> supposed<00:06:45.199> to<00:06:45.440> be<00:06:45.530> as

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:45.800 
better maybe it's just supposed to be as

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.550 
better maybe it's just supposed to be as
good<00:06:46.190> and<00:06:46.490> maybe<00:06:46.789> that's<00:06:46.970> enough<00:06:47.389> but<00:06:48.319> the<00:06:48.440> way

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:48.560 
good and maybe that's enough but the way

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.920 
good and maybe that's enough but the way
that<00:06:48.830> blackberry<00:06:49.490> fans<00:06:49.819> talk<00:06:50.240> about<00:06:50.270> it<00:06:50.750> it's

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:50.930 
that blackberry fans talk about it it's
