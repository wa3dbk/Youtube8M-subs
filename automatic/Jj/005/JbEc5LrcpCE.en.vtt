00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:10.650
 it's scum they've been to most these 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.630
 brake in italy is this is the new one 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.549
 samsung smart watch that was 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.289
 cannot be presented yesterday in Berlin 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.330
 sure to say that the thing has arrived 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.160
 unexpected because it has long been 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.720
 time that is obvious that the market of 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.550
 technology is moving into that 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.529
 increasingly smaller deputy management and 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.630
 of vice that can be worn and 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.699
 samsung has decided to burn the stages e 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.710
 especially in view of the arrival of a 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.690
 possible of similar vice by 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.370
 apple iwatch that has yet to be said 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.020
 no one has seen no one knows if 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.270
 actually this is in production 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.790
 what, however, has been talked about for a while instead 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.649
 blanc presented this precisely a 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.239
 highly anticipated device I would like that 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.890
 look carefully at these photos 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.660
 scum since the first thing I do 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.969
 I'm asked is it really will be possible 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.219
 that a lot of people will start ad 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.690
 wear this type of device 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.280
 well present in fact that this thing 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.410
 which tend to be a small aipo 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.420
 got nothing on the wrist 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.460
 science fiction in this that this 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.379
 which tend to be an ipod touch 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.909
 smaller one held on the wrist 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.560
 thanks to some straps it is not a device 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.210
 which is used alone but is a device 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.710
 which must be coupled to 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.780
 something else for example in the video that 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.790
 you are seeing the clock is paired 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.650
 to a phone because the use that you 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.659
 should do this thing apart 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.460
 obvious things like reading the time on 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.200
 step counter all the applications of the 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.060
 fitness for those who run for those who go 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.650
 bike for things like that but 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.210
 they can easily be found 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.490
 in the vice like that do exactly 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.990
 the one for much less at the level of 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.310
 price is also to display 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.079
 what you should see on the phone 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.540
 notifications of facebook notifications of 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.130
 twitter email photos directly on the 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.350
 wrist instead of having to phone bulls 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.630
 from the pocket but I wonder this is worth 300 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.820
 dollars slash euro because this will be the 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.590
 launch price on September 25 is not 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.740
 safe because it was not announced 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.540
 officially by now we speak from the 250 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.740
 to the 300 dollars therefore the one more or less 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.119
 it should be I don't want to go into it 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.710
 in their own techniques why 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.450
 first of all I was not one of them 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.770
 but I read them on a well-known site that 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.210
 it's technology that is called 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.619
 mascia bolle I leave the link in 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.540
 description because it is not so much either 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.950
 that the point is obvious that from a 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.780
 different so small you can't 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.789
 wait for anything particularly 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.899
 handsome but I repeat it really makes sense 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.000
 have a phone in your pocket but true 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.260
 also another phone on the wrist that does 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.790
 20 percent of what it does 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.379
 your phone in your pocket but that 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.810
 hypothetically to have you have to pay 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:22.000
 a lot of money to me right now 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.890
 looks like the big hype that is normally 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.629
 around a new technology or a 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.129
 new market segment in the world 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:28.840
 of the technology being formed 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:31.000
 because I don't believe that anyway a 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.470
 October or December I will begin to see the 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.840
 people on the street with this thing to the 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.010
 place because she should be nice 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.780
 but in reality it is not 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.430
 and indeed that seems to scream robbery themes 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.200
 rob my this yours a lot 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.450
 of money which means in your pocket or 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.060
 something even more expensive than it can 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.069
 be taken and no I don't talk about my penis 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.329
 I don't know why you thought that 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:51.040
 we should talk about this problem 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:52.510
 anyway scum let me know in the 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.250
 comments what you are going to do 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.930
 you see something like this you are not 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.909
 not at all interested you are more oriented 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.439
 to google glass the possibility of 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:01.389
 I find the phone in my eyes 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:02.799
 something a little more interesting but 

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:04.299
 it's still school to see crushed up 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:04.689
 this notation if you want to see others 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:08.069
 video 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:08.069
 see you later
