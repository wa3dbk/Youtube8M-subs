I<00:00:46.350> have<00:00:46.500> against<00:00:46.890> his<00:00:46.980> implementation<00:00:47.730> but<00:00:48.210> it

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
I have against his implementation but it

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.150 
I have against his implementation but it
isn't<00:00:48.600> entirely<00:00:48.870> his<00:00:49.110> fault<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.680> rules<00:00:49.920> could

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
isn't entirely his fault the rules could

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.680

have<00:00:50.250> been<00:00:50.370> more<00:00:50.520> explicit<00:00:50.879> but<00:00:51.329> since<00:00:51.570> this

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
have been more explicit but since this

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:52.880 
have been more explicit but since this
is<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.960> first<00:00:52.199> year<00:00:52.379> for<00:00:52.559> this<00:00:52.680> type<00:00:52.860> of

those boxes contain information like

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.399 
those boxes contain information like

would<00:04:49.610> only<00:04:49.820> know<00:04:50.060> what<00:04:50.270> it<00:04:50.390> can<00:04:50.450> observe<00:04:51.400> so

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
would only know what it can observe so

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.220 
would only know what it can observe so
what<00:04:52.580> our<00:04:52.700> friend<00:04:52.940> Robin<00:04:53.150> decided<00:04:53.690> to<00:04:53.810> do<00:04:53.960> was

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:54.230 
what our friend Robin decided to do was

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:56.680 
what our friend Robin decided to do was
not<00:04:54.740> to<00:04:54.890> use<00:04:55.070> those<00:04:55.280> classes<00:04:55.730> instead<00:04:56.390> he

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
not to use those classes instead he

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.390 
not to use those classes instead he
decided<00:04:57.050> to<00:04:57.200> copy<00:04:57.380> all<00:04:57.650> of<00:04:57.710> the<00:04:58.010> code<00:04:58.040> from

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
decided to copy all of the code from

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.950 
decided to copy all of the code from
those<00:04:58.610> classes<00:04:58.910> and<00:04:59.360> create<00:04:59.720> his<00:04:59.840> own<00:04:59.900> version

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
those classes and create his own version

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.980 
those classes and create his own version
of<00:05:00.410> them<00:05:00.590> so<00:05:01.220> level<00:05:01.580> Kaseem<00:05:01.910> class<00:05:02.210> exists<00:05:02.840> and

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:02.990 
of them so level Kaseem class exists and

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.780 
of them so level Kaseem class exists and
runs<00:05:03.260> the<00:05:03.380> engine<00:05:03.500> then<00:05:04.070> we<00:05:04.220> have<00:05:04.400> Robins
