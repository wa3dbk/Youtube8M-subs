left over so that I can mix it with some
of<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:05.000> vertebra<00:01:06.000> later<00:01:06.210> on<00:01:06.479> for<00:01:07.250> for<00:01:08.250> putting

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
of the vertebra later on for for putting

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:19.730 
of the vertebra later on for for putting
into<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.090> creases<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.689> such<00:01:10.400> okay<00:01:18.740> again

into the creases and such okay again

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.760 
into the creases and such okay again
three<00:01:20.310> but<00:01:20.909> since<00:01:21.180> we<00:01:21.360> had<00:01:21.630> started<00:01:22.500> out<00:01:22.650> with

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
three but since we had started out with

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.450 
three but since we had started out with
a<00:01:22.830> little<00:01:23.100> bit<00:01:23.189> more<00:01:23.400> paint

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:40.840 

I<00:01:30.860> don't<00:01:31.860> usually<00:01:32.009> measure<00:01:32.549> so<00:01:33.060> it's<00:01:33.210> kind<00:01:33.479> of

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.570 

again<00:01:41.630> I<00:01:41.660> have<00:01:41.960> just<00:01:42.230> pound<00:01:42.830> and<00:01:43.070> pound<00:01:43.250> on<00:01:43.460> the

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
again I have just pound and pound on the

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.280 
again I have just pound and pound on the
paint<00:01:43.850> with<00:01:44.000> that<00:01:44.150> brush<00:01:44.450> just<00:01:44.720> going<00:01:45.110> at<00:01:45.260> it

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
paint with that brush just going at it

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.160 
paint with that brush just going at it
like<00:01:45.440> that<00:01:45.860> to<00:01:46.520> get<00:01:46.670> it<00:01:46.790> well<00:01:47.390> mixed<00:01:47.840> up<00:01:47.990> and

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
like that to get it well mixed up and

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.690 
like that to get it well mixed up and
everything<00:01:48.470> in<00:01:48.590> liquidy<00:01:49.040> so<00:01:49.310> that<00:01:49.460> when<00:01:49.610> you

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
everything in liquidy so that when you

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.420 
everything in liquidy so that when you
add<00:01:49.880> this<00:01:50.150> you<00:01:50.690> don't<00:01:50.870> want<00:01:51.020> any<00:01:51.310> chunks<00:01:52.310> of

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
add this you don't want any chunks of

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.760 
add this you don't want any chunks of
paint<00:01:52.730> that<00:01:53.450> didn't<00:01:53.720> dissolve<00:01:54.050> especially

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
paint that didn't dissolve especially

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.220 
paint that didn't dissolve especially
when<00:01:54.860> you're<00:01:54.980> messing<00:01:55.130> with<00:01:55.310> Reds<00:01:55.730> to<00:01:56.660> end<00:01:57.020> up

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:57.230 
when you're messing with Reds to end up

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.010 
when you're messing with Reds to end up
getting<00:01:57.800> on<00:01:57.920> your<00:01:58.070> sponge<00:01:58.580> and<00:01:58.940> then<00:01:59.870> of

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
getting on your sponge and then of

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.960 
getting on your sponge and then of
course<00:02:00.080> getting<00:02:00.470> on<00:02:00.680> the<00:02:00.860> baby<00:02:01.040> because<00:02:01.729> then

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
course getting on the baby because then

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.790 
course getting on the baby because then
you<00:02:02.120> it's<00:02:02.780> kind<00:02:02.990> of<00:02:03.050> hard<00:02:03.290> to<00:02:03.350> get<00:02:03.530> it<00:02:03.680> off

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.250 
you it's kind of hard to get it off
sometimes<00:02:04.420> sometimes<00:02:05.420> it<00:02:05.570> works<00:02:05.750> out<00:02:05.990> and

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
sometimes sometimes it works out and

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.440 
sometimes sometimes it works out and
looks<00:02:06.470> like<00:02:06.530> a<00:02:06.680> little<00:02:06.890> first<00:02:07.270> mark<00:02:08.270> or

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
looks like a little first mark or

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.210 
looks like a little first mark or
something<00:02:08.660> but<00:02:09.170> not<00:02:09.590> always<00:02:10.300> so<00:02:12.220> really

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
something but not always so really

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.710 
something but not always so really
really<00:02:13.550> really<00:02:14.000> really<00:02:14.360> will<00:02:16.030> push<00:02:17.030> it<00:02:17.209> off<00:02:17.390> of

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
really really really will push it off of

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.370 
really really really will push it off of
that<00:02:18.790> sponge<00:02:19.790> and<00:02:20.150> everything<00:02:20.540> just<00:02:21.020> to<00:02:21.200> get

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
that sponge and everything just to get

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.190 
that sponge and everything just to get
it<00:02:21.500> to<00:02:22.030> make<00:02:23.030> sure<00:02:23.270> it's<00:02:23.450> really<00:02:23.690> well<00:02:23.810> mixed

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
it to make sure it's really well mixed

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.740 
it to make sure it's really well mixed
up<00:02:24.560> which<00:02:24.890> it<00:02:25.040> is<00:02:25.480> okay<00:02:26.480> so<00:02:26.510> we're<00:02:27.470> going<00:02:27.680> to

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
up which it is okay so we're going to

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.140 
up which it is okay so we're going to
start<00:02:29.750> with<00:02:29.900> my<00:02:30.110> other<00:02:30.410> sponge<00:02:31.310> that<00:02:31.820> I<00:02:31.850> had

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
start with my other sponge that I had

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.780 
start with my other sponge that I had
picked<00:02:32.690> out<00:02:34.959> with<00:02:35.959> this<00:02:36.200> you<00:02:36.470> see<00:02:36.680> how<00:02:36.890> the<00:02:37.550> red

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
picked out with this you see how the red

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.540 
picked out with this you see how the red
just<00:02:38.030> really<00:02:38.630> just<00:02:38.930> sucks<00:02:39.320> in<00:02:39.590> instantly<00:02:40.220> so

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
just really just sucks in instantly so

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.850 
just really just sucks in instantly so
it's<00:02:41.390> a<00:02:41.480> lot<00:02:41.630> stronger<00:02:42.110> thanks<00:02:43.750> I<00:02:44.750> really<00:02:45.560> push

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.310 
it's a lot stronger thanks I really push
this<00:02:46.070> down<00:02:46.310> on<00:02:46.489> the<00:02:46.580> paper<00:02:46.820> towel<00:02:47.180> pretty<00:02:48.140> well

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
pretty fast anyway then we're going to

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
can see it makes quite a bit of

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:22.600 
can see it makes quite a bit of
difference<00:03:20.570> then<00:03:20.780> from<00:03:21.049> the<00:03:21.170> blue<00:03:21.410> because<00:03:22.310> it

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
difference then from the blue because it

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.340 
difference then from the blue because it
really<00:03:22.970> really<00:03:23.360> really<00:03:23.390> marks<00:03:24.310> and<00:03:25.989> we<00:03:26.989> do<00:03:27.170> too

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
really really really marks and we do too

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.650 
really really really marks and we do too
much<00:03:27.560> going<00:03:27.860> to<00:03:27.890> take<00:03:28.070> that<00:03:28.250> sponge<00:03:28.820> and<00:03:31.660> go

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
much going to take that sponge and go

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.020 
much going to take that sponge and go
around<00:03:32.840> and<00:03:33.200> Pat<00:03:33.470> it<00:03:33.650> now<00:03:34.160> the<00:03:34.220> red<00:03:34.549> when<00:03:34.910> it

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
around and Pat it now the red when it

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:42.860 
around and Pat it now the red when it
dries<00:03:35.390> does<00:03:36.080> seem<00:03:36.440> to<00:03:37.450> lighten<00:03:38.450> up<00:03:38.600> some

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:48.630 

but<00:03:43.870> if<00:03:43.959> baby's<00:03:44.379> skin<00:03:44.709> is<00:03:44.950> really<00:03:47.400> got<00:03:48.400> a<00:03:48.430> lot

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
but if baby's skin is really got a lot

but if baby's skin is really got a lot
of<00:03:48.670> Ritz<00:03:48.939> in<00:03:49.239> it<00:03:49.390> when<00:03:49.599> they're<00:03:49.780> first<00:03:50.049> born<00:03:51.329> so

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:52.329 
of Ritz in it when they're first born so

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:57.240 
of Ritz in it when they're first born so
you<00:03:52.390> just<00:03:52.659> continue<00:03:52.900> to<00:03:55.769> just<00:03:56.769> like<00:03:56.920> I<00:03:57.040> did<00:03:57.220> in

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
you just continue to just like I did in

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.030 
you just continue to just like I did in
the<00:03:57.459> last<00:03:57.489> video<00:03:57.909> you<00:03:58.420> can<00:03:58.599> actually<00:03:59.040> where

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
the last video you can actually where

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.270 
the last video you can actually where
you<00:04:00.159> blotted<00:04:00.730> the<00:04:01.299> paint<00:04:01.890> not<00:04:02.890> even<00:04:03.129> rush

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
you blotted the paint not even rush

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.610 
you blotted the paint not even rush
where<00:04:03.489> that<00:04:03.640> doesn't<00:04:04.000> work<00:04:04.120> better<00:04:04.659> start<00:04:05.470> out

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
where that doesn't work better start out

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.589 
where that doesn't work better start out
that<00:04:05.799> way<00:04:05.859> even<00:04:06.189> because<00:04:07.030> as<00:04:07.180> you<00:04:07.299> see<00:04:07.480> it

00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:07.599 
that way even because as you see it

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:09.569 
that way even because as you see it
looks<00:04:07.750> a<00:04:07.840> little<00:04:08.019> bit<00:04:08.379> better<00:04:08.680> than<00:04:08.980> that

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:09.579 
looks a little bit better than that

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:11.699 
looks a little bit better than that
right<00:04:09.760> there<00:04:09.819> where<00:04:10.810> you<00:04:10.900> blotted<00:04:11.319> it<00:04:11.409> on<00:04:11.530> the

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
right there where you blotted it on the

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:13.800 
right there where you blotted it on the
paper<00:04:11.950> towel<00:04:12.310> and<00:04:12.700> then<00:04:12.970> you<00:04:13.090> just<00:04:13.329> come<00:04:13.599> in

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
paper towel and then you just come in

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.460 
paper towel and then you just come in
and<00:04:14.700> blot<00:04:15.700> it<00:04:15.819> like<00:04:16.000> that<00:04:16.209> on<00:04:16.389> there<00:04:16.600> to<00:04:16.810> get

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
and blot it like that on there to get

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:23.010 
and blot it like that on there to get
some<00:04:17.680> more<00:04:17.799> paint<00:04:18.070> onto<00:04:18.280> your<00:04:19.590> sponge<00:04:21.810> now<00:04:22.810> I

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
some more paint onto your sponge now I

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.700 
some more paint onto your sponge now I
use<00:04:23.470> in-between<00:04:24.900> ones<00:04:25.900> like<00:04:26.199> this<00:04:26.410> type<00:04:26.680> of

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
use in-between ones like this type of

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.439 
use in-between ones like this type of
stuff<00:04:27.039> rather<00:04:27.250> than<00:04:27.490> sticking<00:04:27.789> it<00:04:28.000> into<00:04:28.210> the

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:28.449 
stuff rather than sticking it into the

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:31.620 
stuff rather than sticking it into the
oven<00:04:28.630> and<00:04:29.020> having<00:04:29.949> to<00:04:30.070> wait<00:04:30.280> 8<00:04:30.580> minutes<00:04:31.000> I<00:04:31.180> use

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
oven and having to wait 8 minutes I use

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:36.240 
oven and having to wait 8 minutes I use
the<00:04:32.880> heat<00:04:33.880> gun<00:04:33.910> that<00:04:34.630> Genesis<00:04:35.139> makes<00:04:35.440> works

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
the heat gun that Genesis makes works

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:37.800 
the heat gun that Genesis makes works
really<00:04:36.520> well<00:04:36.789> you<00:04:37.120> just<00:04:37.240> have<00:04:37.389> to<00:04:37.510> move<00:04:37.630> it

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
really well you just have to move it

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:45.180 
really well you just have to move it
very<00:04:37.919> very<00:04:38.919> slowly<00:04:39.810> across<00:04:40.810> the<00:04:43.650> the<00:04:44.650> vinyl<00:04:45.039> so

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
very very slowly across the the vinyl so

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.480 
very very slowly across the the vinyl so
that<00:04:45.310> you<00:04:45.460> get<00:04:45.810> every<00:04:46.810> single<00:04:47.160> little<00:04:48.160> spot

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
that you get every single little spot

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.089 
that you get every single little spot
dried<00:04:49.240> really<00:04:49.690> really<00:04:49.990> well<00:04:50.260> because<00:04:50.590> if<00:04:50.949> you

00:04:51.089 --> 00:04:51.099 
dried really really well because if you

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:55.320 
dried really really well because if you
don't<00:04:51.360> then<00:04:53.699> sometimes<00:04:54.699> you'll<00:04:54.820> take<00:04:55.090> off

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
don't then sometimes you'll take off

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.210 
don't then sometimes you'll take off
what<00:04:56.050> you've<00:04:56.229> already<00:04:56.320> put<00:04:56.650> on<00:04:56.800> when<00:04:56.979> you<00:04:57.070> go

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
what you've already put on when you go

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:58.800 
what you've already put on when you go
with<00:04:57.370> the<00:04:57.520> next<00:04:57.760> layer<00:04:58.030> so<00:04:58.360> you<00:04:58.419> have<00:04:58.630> to<00:04:58.720> be

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
with the next layer so you have to be

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.960 
with the next layer so you have to be
kind<00:04:59.020> of<00:04:59.080> careful<00:04:59.289> there<00:04:59.710> and<00:05:00.340> see<00:05:00.639> I<00:05:00.669> guess

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:00.970 
kind of careful there and see I guess

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:02.790 
kind of careful there and see I guess
you<00:05:01.090> can<00:05:01.240> cry<00:05:01.449> see<00:05:01.720> how<00:05:01.930> that<00:05:02.110> looks<00:05:02.380> I'm<00:05:02.590> kind

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
you can cry see how that looks I'm kind

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.020 
you can cry see how that looks I'm kind
of<00:05:02.830> like<00:05:03.010> this<00:05:03.250> one<00:05:03.840> I<00:05:04.840> said<00:05:05.550> we're<00:05:06.550> gonna<00:05:06.669> stop

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
of like this one I said we're gonna stop

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:08.939 
of like this one I said we're gonna stop
it<00:05:07.240> now<00:05:07.389> and<00:05:07.419> I'm<00:05:07.840> gonna<00:05:08.020> fight<00:05:08.289> do<00:05:08.440> it<00:05:08.560> with<00:05:08.740> my

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:08.949 
it now and I'm gonna fight do it with my

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:11.879 
it now and I'm gonna fight do it with my
gun<00:05:09.280> and<00:05:09.669> then<00:05:10.330> I'll<00:05:10.479> come<00:05:10.750> back<00:05:10.930> and<00:05:11.260> add<00:05:11.860> some

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:11.889 
gun and then I'll come back and add some

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:15.120 
gun and then I'll come back and add some
different<00:05:12.430> colors<00:05:12.760> in<00:05:12.940> there
