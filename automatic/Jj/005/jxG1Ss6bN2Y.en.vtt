00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
I like the decision review system if

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.709 
I like the decision review system if
you're<00:02:01.649> sitting<00:02:01.950> as<00:02:02.219> I<00:02:02.399> do<00:02:02.460> now<00:02:02.820> on<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.509> lounge

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
can critique it's a great part of the

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.089 
can critique it's a great part of the
game<00:02:08.369> but<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:09.629> trouble<00:02:10.050> is<00:02:10.140> as<00:02:10.319> a<00:02:10.349> player<00:02:10.739> it

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
game but the trouble is as a player it

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.730 
game but the trouble is as a player it
was<00:02:11.910> set<00:02:12.480> up<00:02:12.510> to<00:02:12.750> avoid<00:02:13.170> the<00:02:13.319> hell

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
was set up to avoid the hell

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.890 
was set up to avoid the hell
and<00:02:13.830> and<00:02:14.520> if<00:02:14.730> anything<00:02:15.150> it's<00:02:15.330> actually<00:02:15.480> done

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
and and if anything it's actually done

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.560 
and and if anything it's actually done
anything<00:02:16.410> but<00:02:16.830> that<00:02:17.100> you<00:02:17.700> know<00:02:17.820> so<00:02:18.030> we've<00:02:18.390> got

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
anything but that you know so we've got

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.930 
anything but that you know so we've got
this<00:02:18.690> now<00:02:18.900> conundrum<00:02:19.650> where<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.370> DRS<00:02:20.910> is

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
this now conundrum where the DRS is

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.000 
this now conundrum where the DRS is
actually<00:02:21.450> interfering<00:02:22.050> with<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.290> game<00:02:22.500> it's

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
actually interfering with the game it's

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.640 
actually interfering with the game it's
causing<00:02:23.460> five<00:02:23.820> minutes<00:02:24.300> of<00:02:24.420> play<00:02:24.690> every<00:02:25.410> time

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
causing five minutes of play every time

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.100 
causing five minutes of play every time
the<00:02:25.890> stoppages<00:02:26.400> are<00:02:26.550> just<00:02:26.760> so<00:02:27.300> frustrating

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
the stoppages are just so frustrating

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.780 
the stoppages are just so frustrating
you<00:02:28.170> just<00:02:28.380> feel<00:02:28.590> like<00:02:28.740> belting<00:02:29.160> the<00:02:29.250> TV<00:02:29.580> down

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
you just feel like belting the TV down

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.060 
you just feel like belting the TV down
and<00:02:30.690> then<00:02:30.870> they<00:02:31.020> don't<00:02:31.200> may<00:02:31.440> get<00:02:31.620> it<00:02:31.710> right<00:02:31.890> at

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
and then they don't may get it right at

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.220 
and then they don't may get it right at
the<00:02:32.190> end<00:02:32.340> of<00:02:32.490> all<00:02:32.640> that<00:02:32.820> anyway<00:02:33.300> plus<00:02:33.960> the

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
the end of all that anyway plus the

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.870 
the end of all that anyway plus the
actual<00:02:34.350> relationship<00:02:34.770> to<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.520> umpire

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
actual relationship to the umpire

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.670 
actual relationship to the umpire
something<00:02:36.300> which<00:02:36.420> I've<00:02:36.570> really<00:02:36.930> cherished<00:02:37.380> as

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
something which I've really cherished as

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.100 
something which I've really cherished as
a<00:02:37.710> player<00:02:38.040> gets<00:02:38.760> completely<00:02:39.300> destroyed<00:02:39.870> I

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
just think what is the upside of the RS

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.120 
just think what is the upside of the RS

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:22.740 
getting a bit close to the line because

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.830 
getting a bit close to the line because
he'd<00:03:23.100> walk<00:03:23.340> a<00:03:23.370> couple<00:03:23.700> of<00:03:23.910> paces<00:03:24.060> towards<00:03:24.660> me
