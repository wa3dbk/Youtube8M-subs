00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.190
 top define you delete the fourth goal 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:21.160
 It is still very important that she 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:24.610
 and can close soon installed 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:32.040
 I opt fini now let's test opens the 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:35.740
 your minecraft comes edith profile singles 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:42.310
 the name of the folder there that you created in 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:44.610
 if that here the devil you save and 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.610
 play 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:58.780
 that's all you see if I create a world 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:01.200
 here to see how much fps quetta is 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.200
 tals 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.730
 in case the party will not be here any more 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:10.030
 because I 'm recording and even with the 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:13.380
 video card does not help the fan 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.380
 continues when I'm recording 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:22.150
 so here you can see that it's 20 to 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:26.260
 30 fps 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:29.760
 you see the language options the show 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.760
 switch to portuguese 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:37.230
 to explain it better now I need to see 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:39.450
 in network video settings 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.030
 distance to draw a fan you go 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.300
 put on the team 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:48.709
 fast graphics soft lighting 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:54.120
 deactivated sewer live much lighting Ã³ 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:55.769
 clear shine fog off what do you think 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.269
 that will only work if the people are 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:00.660
 So you can leave it alone. 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:06.600
 Here you will put when max fps 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:08.549
 vision move off vain details 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:14.250
 leave it the way it is 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:19.049
 You're just going to take the sky, fog and the 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:22.440
 ok stars or finish now in 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:24.930
 animations you put everything in the off 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.990
 if you play hardcore games it 's important 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:30.810
 you leave items in an animation quÃ© 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.490
 to your compass you can point to the 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.830
 someone else in my case leave here the 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:37.800
 but will have your choice you play or 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:45.200
 not quality 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:48.830
 I leave everything ok can put all nine 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:53.440

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:05.240
 completed and how you can see the oil 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:12.200
 fps cough was 30 at that time 30 17 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:16.010
