00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.690 
off-white - I just don't there's solid
wood<00:00:39.149> so<00:00:39.960> I'd<00:00:40.079> much<00:00:40.260> rather<00:00:40.290> stain<00:00:40.920> them<00:00:41.190> then

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
dark color then paint them because our

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.290

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
gel stain that was so simple I just

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.160 
gel stain that was so simple I just
rubbed<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.370> on<00:00:56.489> it's<00:00:56.699> usually<00:00:57.510> like<00:00:57.930> this

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
rubbed it on it's usually like this

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.770 
rubbed it on it's usually like this
golden<00:00:58.739> oak<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.160> I<00:00:59.250> put<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.520> walnut<00:00:59.879> of<00:01:00.270> it<00:01:00.449> but

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
golden oak and I put a walnut of it but

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.219 
golden oak and I put a walnut of it but
it's<00:01:00.899> so<00:01:01.230> not<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:02.190> big<00:01:02.940> difference<00:01:03.690> so<00:01:03.870> then

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
it's so not a big difference so then

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.480 
it's so not a big difference so then
what<00:01:04.439> I<00:01:04.470> did<00:01:04.619> was<00:01:04.769> ordered<00:01:05.430> expresso<00:01:06.390> staying
