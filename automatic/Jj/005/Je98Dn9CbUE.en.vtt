go wrong with DB X remember this is
american-made<00:02:00.450> stuff<00:02:00.840> it<00:02:01.560> was<00:02:01.710> made<00:02:01.890> in<00:02:02.070> the

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
american-made stuff it was made in the

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.539 
american-made stuff it was made in the
90s<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:02.790> you<00:02:02.909> can<00:02:03.030> also<00:02:03.210> get<00:02:03.479> a<00:02:03.540> um<00:02:03.869> a<00:02:04.549> digital

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
90s and you can also get a um a digital

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.969 
90s and you can also get a um a digital
output<00:02:05.939> for<00:02:06.180> it<00:02:06.270> as<00:02:06.360> well<00:02:06.570> so<00:02:07.409> this<00:02:07.649> is<00:02:07.770> great

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
output for it as well so this is great

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.279 
output for it as well so this is great

at a lower cost point on a little lower
price<00:02:17.370> point<00:02:17.730> and<00:02:17.970> I<00:02:18.750> highly<00:02:19.110> recommend<00:02:19.590> it

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
price point and I highly recommend it

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.710 
price point and I highly recommend it
especially<00:02:20.340> in<00:02:20.790> today's<00:02:21.060> market<00:02:21.570> where

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
especially in today's market where

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.310 
especially in today's market where
people<00:02:21.840> are<00:02:22.080> not<00:02:22.230> making<00:02:22.440> a<00:02:22.620> lot<00:02:22.800> of<00:02:22.830> money<00:02:24.320> the

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
people are not making a lot of money the

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.730 
people are not making a lot of money the
compression<00:02:25.890> is<00:02:26.570> DVS<00:02:27.570> compression<00:02:28.170> as<00:02:28.350> I<00:02:28.530> said

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
compression is DVS compression as I said

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.670 
compression is DVS compression as I said
how<00:02:28.890> can<00:02:29.070> you<00:02:29.130> go<00:02:29.280> wrong<00:02:29.310> and<00:02:29.990> as<00:02:30.990> you<00:02:31.410> can<00:02:31.530> see

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
how can you go wrong and as you can see

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.260 
how can you go wrong and as you can see
right<00:02:31.800> there<00:02:31.860> the<00:02:32.370> light<00:02:32.580> is<00:02:32.730> out<00:02:32.880> on<00:02:32.910> one<00:02:33.240> of

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
right there the light is out on one of

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:38.330 
right there the light is out on one of
my<00:02:33.360> vu<00:02:33.690> meters<00:02:34.610> but<00:02:35.610> I<00:02:36.740> really<00:02:37.740> like<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:38.040> unit

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
my vu meters but I really like the unit

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.240 
my vu meters but I really like the unit
and<00:02:38.490> I<00:02:38.550> can<00:02:38.760> I<00:02:38.790> can<00:02:39.650> recommend<00:02:40.650> to<00:02:40.980> anybody

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
and I can I can recommend to anybody

and I can I can recommend to anybody
who's<00:02:41.580> looking<00:02:41.850> for<00:02:42.180> an<00:02:42.570> alternative<00:02:43.410> to<00:02:43.470> the

plugins<00:02:50.460> because<00:02:50.640> I'm<00:02:51.150> going<00:02:51.390> to<00:02:51.450> tell<00:02:51.660> you

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
plugins because I'm going to tell you

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.360 
plugins because I'm going to tell you
when<00:02:52.500> you<00:02:52.590> compare<00:02:53.390> the<00:02:55.160> compression<00:02:56.160> on<00:02:56.340> a

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
when you compare the compression on a

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.590 
when you compare the compression on a
unit<00:02:56.850> like<00:02:57.030> this<00:02:57.270> -<00:02:57.990> what<00:02:58.260> you<00:02:58.380> get<00:02:58.560> on<00:02:58.770> plugins

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
unit like this - what you get on plugins

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.000 
unit like this - what you get on plugins
is<00:03:00.600> no<00:03:01.260> comparison

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
is no comparison

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.220 
is no comparison
there's<00:03:02.910> no<00:03:03.090> comparison<00:03:03.390> and<00:03:03.780> you<00:03:03.870> and<00:03:04.080> you

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
there's no comparison and you and you

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.660 
there's no comparison and you and you
won't<00:03:04.380> know<00:03:04.680> that<00:03:04.710> until<00:03:05.040> you<00:03:05.190> actually<00:03:05.460> start

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
won't know that until you actually start

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.220 
won't know that until you actually start
using<00:03:06.680> good<00:03:07.680> outboard<00:03:08.610> gear<00:03:08.990> so<00:03:09.990> just

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
using good outboard gear so just

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.420 
using good outboard gear so just
something<00:03:10.380> to<00:03:10.560> think<00:03:10.590> about<00:03:10.950> this<00:03:11.100> is<00:03:11.250> brother

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
something to think about this is brother
