you've<00:01:05.580> done<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:05.760> simply<00:01:06.540> put<00:01:06.659> it<00:01:06.720> back

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
you've done that simply put it back

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.320 
you've done that simply put it back
together<00:01:07.010> filter<00:01:08.010> on<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.130> front<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:09.150> great

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
together filter on the front the great

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
together filter on the front the great
thing<00:01:09.360> about<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.720> Rose<00:01:09.869> light<00:01:10.049> is<00:01:10.170> how<00:01:10.320> easy

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
thing about the Rose light is how easy

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.530 
thing about the Rose light is how easy
it<00:01:10.680> is<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.950> deploy<00:01:11.210> simply<00:01:12.350> 12<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.650> on<00:01:14.420> so<00:01:15.420> the

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
it is the deploy simply 12 and on so the

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.120 
it is the deploy simply 12 and on so the
design<00:01:15.689> of<00:01:15.840> Rosa<00:01:16.200> light<00:01:16.409> has<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.619> rubberized

design of Rosa light has a rubberized
matte<00:01:17.520> black<00:01:17.729> finish<00:01:17.790> which<00:01:18.210> means<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:18.540> a

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
matte black finish which means that a

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.499 
matte black finish which means that a
it's<00:01:18.930> extremely<00:01:19.350> secure<00:01:19.619> on<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.860> light<00:01:20.509> comes

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
it's extremely secure on the light comes

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.060 
it's extremely secure on the light comes
off<00:01:21.630> extremely<00:01:21.900> quickly<00:01:22.259> well<00:01:22.860> it's<00:01:22.950> like

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
off extremely quickly well it's like

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.320 
off extremely quickly well it's like
does<00:01:23.159> not<00:01:23.340> affect<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.670> sound<00:01:23.790> of<00:01:23.939> microphone

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
does not affect the sound of microphone

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.270 
does not affect the sound of microphone
because<00:01:24.540> roads<00:01:24.900> like<00:01:25.140> typically<00:01:25.799> sits<00:01:26.070> in<00:01:26.220> the
