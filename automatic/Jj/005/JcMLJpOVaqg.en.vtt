really awesome looks like it's been made

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.289 
really awesome looks like it's been made
for<00:02:28.739> inking<00:02:29.069> and<00:02:29.159> dry<00:02:29.340> brushing<00:02:29.790> really

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
for inking and dry brushing really

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:33.309 
for inking and dry brushing really
really<00:02:30.510> cool<00:02:30.780> one<00:02:31.379> of<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.530> ideas<00:02:31.799> that<00:02:31.890> I<00:02:32.010> had

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
really cool one of the ideas that I had

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.270 
really cool one of the ideas that I had
that<00:02:34.319> would<00:02:34.379> be<00:02:34.530> fun

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
that would be fun

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.690 
that would be fun
is<00:02:35.900> is<00:02:36.900> to<00:02:37.319> do<00:02:37.470> something<00:02:37.650> like<00:02:37.769> as<00:02:37.980> each<00:02:38.189> disc

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
is is to do something like as each disc

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.240 
is is to do something like as each disc
I<00:02:39.060> got<00:02:39.689> two<00:02:39.870> styles<00:02:40.290> of<00:02:40.349> these<00:02:40.530> this<00:02:40.889> is<00:02:41.099> the

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
I got two styles of these this is the

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.259 
I got two styles of these this is the
other<00:02:41.430> style<00:02:41.879> and<00:02:42.560> this<00:02:43.560> is<00:02:43.879> basically<00:02:44.879> a

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
other style and this is basically a

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:52.789 
other style and this is basically a
floaty<00:02:45.930> z<00:02:46.769> CH<00:02:46.799> disc<00:02:49.970> it's<00:02:50.970> not<00:02:51.120> glued<00:02:51.750> but<00:02:52.680> it's

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
floaty z CH disc it's not glued but it's

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:54.140 
floaty z CH disc it's not glued but it's
plenty<00:02:53.069> big<00:02:53.220> enough<00:02:53.250> I<00:02:53.609> mean<00:02:53.760> you've<00:02:53.879> got<00:02:54.030> an

um<00:03:20.419> this<00:03:21.419> design<00:03:21.900> is<00:03:22.109> not<00:03:22.430> quite<00:03:23.430> as

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:27.919 

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:32.629 

pointy<00:03:28.919> and<00:03:29.930> so<00:03:30.930> I've<00:03:31.319> got<00:03:31.530> kind<00:03:31.829> of<00:03:31.949> my<00:03:32.190> my

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:32.639 
pointy and so I've got kind of my my

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:37.009 
pointy and so I've got kind of my my
good<00:03:33.090> my<00:03:33.900> good<00:03:34.199> guy<00:03:34.379> disc<00:03:35.099> and<00:03:35.489> my<00:03:36.479> bad<00:03:36.810> guy

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
good my good guy disc and my bad guy

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:38.360 
good my good guy disc and my bad guy
disc<00:03:37.319> and<00:03:37.680> they're<00:03:37.859> completely

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
disc and they're completely

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:44.000 
disc and they're completely

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
interchangeable as you could see so you

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.830 
interchangeable as you could see so you
know<00:03:44.129> you<00:03:44.609> always<00:03:44.790> want<00:03:45.000> to<00:03:45.030> make<00:03:45.180> yourself<00:03:45.750> as

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
know you always want to make yourself as

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.330 
know you always want to make yourself as
multifunctional<00:03:46.560> as<00:03:46.680> possible

another thing that I haven't had the
chance<00:03:53.430> to<00:03:53.699> cast<00:03:54.030> it<00:03:54.239> yet<00:03:54.419> are<00:03:55.019> these<00:03:55.409> bad<00:03:55.680> boys

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
chance to cast it yet are these bad boys

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.300 
chance to cast it yet are these bad boys
they're<00:03:57.000> like<00:03:57.629> Celtic<00:03:57.989> square<00:03:58.319> knots<00:03:58.560> both

I'm really really eager to to to pour
this<00:04:05.400> and<00:04:05.699> really<00:04:06.479> check<00:04:06.659> out<00:04:06.780> the

this and really check out the

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.170 
this and really check out the
possibilities<00:04:07.379> the<00:04:07.620> heights<00:04:08.340> are<00:04:08.669> very

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
possibilities the heights are very

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.610 
possibilities the heights are very
similar<00:04:09.599> to<00:04:10.019> those<00:04:11.009> heights<00:04:11.430> and<00:04:12.259> this<00:04:13.259> is<00:04:13.439> not

similar to those heights and this is not

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.990 
similar to those heights and this is not
even<00:04:13.739> close<00:04:14.009> to<00:04:14.069> being<00:04:14.280> the<00:04:14.939> right<00:04:15.150> height<00:04:15.449> but

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
even close to being the right height but

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.740 
even close to being the right height but
if<00:04:18.000> I<00:04:18.180> can<00:04:18.359> control<00:04:18.750> my<00:04:18.930> depth<00:04:19.380> you've<00:04:20.370> got

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
if I can control my depth you've got

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.200 
if I can control my depth you've got
