basically what the thing is is you use a

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.210 
basically what the thing is is you use a
lot<00:00:48.519> of<00:00:48.550> sponges<00:00:49.510> to<00:00:49.540> go<00:00:49.720> diagonally<00:00:50.440> and<00:00:50.620> what

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:51.220 
lot of sponges to go diagonally and what

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.859 
lot of sponges to go diagonally and what
you're<00:00:51.339> going<00:00:51.430> to<00:00:51.519> do<00:00:51.640> is<00:00:51.820> you<00:00:52.420> will<00:00:52.540> launch

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:52.869 
you're going to do is you will launch

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:55.560 
you're going to do is you will launch
the<00:00:53.019> thumb<00:00:53.320> really<00:00:53.799> far<00:00:54.189> into<00:00:54.879> the<00:00:55.150> air<00:00:55.330> and

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
the thumb really far into the air and

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.140 
the thumb really far into the air and
what<00:00:56.229> we<00:00:56.350> did<00:00:56.470> is<00:00:56.619> we<00:00:56.650> camped<00:00:57.159> right<00:00:57.309> next<00:00:58.089> to

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.150 
what we did is we camped right next to

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.090 
what we did is we camped right next to
the<00:00:58.239> force<00:00:58.420> field<00:00:58.659> five<00:00:58.900> blocks<00:00:59.140> away<00:00:59.259> so<00:00:59.949> this

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
the force field five blocks away so this

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.530 
the force field five blocks away so this
will<00:01:00.220> shoot<00:01:00.460> them<00:01:00.580> like<00:01:00.850> hundreds<00:01:01.269> of<00:01:01.330> blocks

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:01.540 
will shoot them like hundreds of blocks

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.049 
will shoot them like hundreds of blocks
into<00:01:01.809> the<00:01:02.080> force<00:01:02.320> field<00:01:02.589> and<00:01:02.799> we'll<00:01:03.729> get<00:01:03.909> to

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
into the force field and we'll get to

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:06.090 
into the force field and we'll get to
some<00:01:04.180> clips<00:01:04.479> in<00:01:04.659> just<00:01:04.930> a<00:01:05.019> second<00:01:05.470> so<00:01:05.920> this<00:01:06.070> is

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
some clips in just a second so this is

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.670 
some clips in just a second so this is
what<00:01:06.430> this<00:01:06.549> traps<00:01:06.909> all<00:01:07.090> about<00:01:07.420> I<00:01:07.659> mean<00:01:08.020> Opie<00:01:08.560> as

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
heck you can see me right here designing

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.300 
heck you can see me right here designing
and<00:01:12.070> developing<00:01:12.189> it<00:01:13.770> yeah<00:01:14.770> so<00:01:15.040> this<00:01:15.100> was

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
and developing it yeah so this was

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:16.530 
and developing it yeah so this was
designed<00:01:15.460> and<00:01:15.729> created<00:01:15.850> by<00:01:16.000> the<00:01:16.150> one<00:01:16.390> and<00:01:16.509> only

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
designed and created by the one and only

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.499 
designed and created by the one and only
Dino<00:01:16.840> sponge<00:01:17.140> and<00:01:17.350> then<00:01:17.710> Android<00:01:18.460> 875<00:01:19.090> he<00:01:19.329> came

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509 
Dino sponge and then Android 875 he came

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:23.670 
Dino sponge and then Android 875 he came
in<00:01:19.630> with<00:01:19.659> the<00:01:19.840> idea<00:01:20.290> of<00:01:22.020> he<00:01:23.020> came<00:01:23.409> up<00:01:23.530> to<00:01:23.560> the

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
in with the idea of he came up to the

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.349 
in with the idea of he came up to the
idea<00:01:23.890> of<00:01:23.920> using<00:01:24.070> fisherman<00:01:24.640> to<00:01:24.819> fish<00:01:25.030> the

00:01:25.349 --> 00:01:25.359 
idea of using fisherman to fish the

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:27.270 
idea of using fisherman to fish the
opponent<00:01:25.840> into<00:01:25.990> the<00:01:26.200> sponge<00:01:26.590> which<00:01:26.799> is<00:01:26.950> also<00:01:27.130> a

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
opponent into the sponge which is also a

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.059 
opponent into the sponge which is also a
good<00:01:27.460> idea<00:01:27.520> of<00:01:27.850> good<00:01:27.999> strategy<00:01:28.390> and<00:01:28.600> I<00:01:29.170> see<00:01:29.890> for

00:01:30.059 --> 00:01:30.069 
good idea of good strategy and I see for
