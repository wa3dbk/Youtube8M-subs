00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.469 

hey<00:00:00.750> there

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:01.479 
hey there

00:00:01.479 --> 00:00:05.810 
hey there
today<00:00:02.020> we're<00:00:02.170> going<00:00:02.260> to<00:00:02.409> make<00:00:02.530> an<00:00:02.620> eye<00:00:02.739> patch

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:05.820 

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:13.430 

for<00:00:06.690> the<00:00:07.020> CL<00:00:07.650> costume<00:00:08.309> that<00:00:09.090> we're<00:00:09.300> making

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.900 

I<00:00:13.530> decided

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
I decided

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.450 
I decided
go<00:00:15.360> through<00:00:15.750> some<00:00:16.289> things<00:00:16.560> that<00:00:17.250> I<00:00:17.279> would

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
go through some things that I would

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.730 
go through some things that I would
probably<00:00:18.119> never<00:00:18.330> wear<00:00:18.690> this<00:00:18.960> looks<00:00:19.260> very

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
probably never wear this looks very

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.749 
probably never wear this looks very
uncomfortable<00:00:19.980> and<00:00:21.230> I<00:00:22.230> figure<00:00:23.040> it's<00:00:23.310> got<00:00:23.580> the

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:23.759 
uncomfortable and I figure it's got the

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:26.330 
uncomfortable and I figure it's got the
right<00:00:24.000> thickness<00:00:24.630> of<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.710> fabric<00:00:26.130> that<00:00:26.160> I

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
right thickness of the fabric that I

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.790 
right thickness of the fabric that I
need<00:00:26.490> for<00:00:26.700> the<00:00:26.790> eye<00:00:26.820> patch<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.509> the<00:00:28.230> elastic

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
need for the eye patch and the elastic

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.070 
need for the eye patch and the elastic
is<00:00:28.980> nice<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.490> soft<00:00:29.730> so<00:00:30.000> it's<00:00:30.360> not<00:00:30.540> going<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:30.810> be

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
is nice and soft so it's not going to be

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.060 
is nice and soft so it's not going to be
like<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.289> brain<00:00:31.590> squeezer<00:00:31.949> and<00:00:33.350> as<00:00:34.350> you<00:00:34.680> can<00:00:34.800> see

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
like a brain squeezer and as you can see

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.360 
like a brain squeezer and as you can see
here<00:00:35.340> I'm<00:00:35.519> seam<00:00:35.820> ripping<00:00:36.559> this<00:00:37.559> it's<00:00:38.129> got<00:00:38.340> a

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
here I'm seam ripping this it's got a

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.390 
here I'm seam ripping this it's got a
nice<00:00:38.670> fold<00:00:39.059> in<00:00:39.330> it<00:00:39.449> so<00:00:39.660> I<00:00:39.690> figure<00:00:40.320> when<00:00:41.040> I<00:00:41.070> cut

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:41.400 
nice fold in it so I figure when I cut

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.790 
nice fold in it so I figure when I cut
the<00:00:41.550> shape<00:00:41.790> of<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.720> eye<00:00:42.750> patch<00:00:43.050> that<00:00:43.320> I<00:00:43.350> want<00:00:43.620> I

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
the shape of the eye patch that I want I

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.460 
the shape of the eye patch that I want I
can<00:00:44.010> reattach<00:00:44.280> this<00:00:44.839> because<00:00:45.839> it's<00:00:46.050> it's

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:46.470 
can reattach this because it's it's

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.440 
can reattach this because it's it's
holding<00:00:46.800> its<00:00:46.950> shape<00:00:47.129> really<00:00:47.370> well<00:00:47.670> so<00:00:48.149> it's

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
holding its shape really well so it's

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.760 
holding its shape really well so it's
not<00:00:48.540> I'm<00:00:48.870> not<00:00:49.050> going<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.230> have<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.410> fight<00:00:49.620> with

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
not I'm not going to have to fight with

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.040 
not I'm not going to have to fight with
it<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:49.950> lot<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.340> I<00:00:50.730> can<00:00:50.910> just<00:00:51.239> reuse<00:00:51.600> everything

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
it a lot and I can just reuse everything

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.700 
it a lot and I can just reuse everything
here<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.820> make<00:00:54.230> something<00:00:55.230> out<00:00:55.440> of<00:00:55.500> it<00:00:55.680> that

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
here to make something out of it that

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:04.070 
here to make something out of it that
can<00:00:56.160> actually<00:00:56.340> be<00:00:56.520> used

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.610 

here<00:01:04.740> are<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.070> pieces<00:01:05.550> that<00:01:05.760> we're<00:01:06.060> going<00:01:06.180> to

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:06.620 
here are the pieces that we're going to

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:13.600 
here are the pieces that we're going to
back<00:01:06.710> on<00:01:06.920> and<00:01:08.200> then<00:01:11.920> see<00:01:12.920> if<00:01:13.070> we<00:01:13.250> can<00:01:13.400> figure

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
back on and then see if we can figure

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:22.330 
back on and then see if we can figure
out<00:01:13.790> about<00:01:14.150> the<00:01:14.390> right<00:01:14.600> size<00:01:14.990> for<00:01:15.020> an<00:01:15.470> eyepatch

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:36.090 

I<00:01:22.399> think<00:01:23.270> that<00:01:23.420> looks<00:01:23.630> about<00:01:23.780> right

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.590 

you

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.820 

you

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.380 

always<00:01:45.460> looks<00:01:45.610> like<00:01:45.730> a<00:01:45.760> little<00:01:46.000> heart<00:01:48.390> not

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
always looks like a little heart not

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.630 
always looks like a little heart not
much<00:01:49.780> less<00:01:50.170> there<00:01:50.440> than<00:01:50.470> was<00:01:50.800> originally<00:01:50.980> huh

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
much less there than was originally huh

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.690 
much less there than was originally huh
okay<00:01:52.450> so<00:01:52.950> I'm<00:01:53.950> going<00:01:54.820> to<00:01:54.910> pin<00:01:55.120> this<00:01:55.270> down<00:01:55.590> and

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
okay so I'm going to pin this down and

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.480 
okay so I'm going to pin this down and
stitch<00:01:57.700> it<00:01:57.730> on<00:01:57.910> and<00:01:58.690> we'll<00:01:58.810> go<00:01:58.930> from<00:01:59.050> there

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.040 

now<00:02:03.490> this<00:02:03.730> is<00:02:03.910> one<00:02:04.090> of<00:02:04.210> those<00:02:04.330> deals<00:02:04.690> that

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050 
now this is one of those deals that

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.710 
now this is one of those deals that
because<00:02:05.770> it's<00:02:05.950> so<00:02:06.130> tiny<00:02:06.400> and<00:02:06.790> I'm<00:02:06.970> a<00:02:07.000> bit<00:02:07.480> of<00:02:07.600> an

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
because it's so tiny and I'm a bit of an

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.980 
because it's so tiny and I'm a bit of an
oath<00:02:07.960> when<00:02:08.649> it<00:02:08.800> comes<00:02:09.039> to<00:02:09.310> the<00:02:10.149> sewing<00:02:10.570> machine

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
oath when it comes to the sewing machine

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.700 
oath when it comes to the sewing machine
I<00:02:11.530> might<00:02:12.130> gather<00:02:12.400> this<00:02:12.790> together<00:02:13.470> tack<00:02:14.470> it

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
I might gather this together tack it

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.700 
I might gather this together tack it
with<00:02:14.890> something<00:02:15.100> sticky<00:02:15.670> or<00:02:16.260> lightly<00:02:17.260> stitch

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
with something sticky or lightly stitch

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.050 
with something sticky or lightly stitch
it<00:02:17.860> and<00:02:17.980> then<00:02:18.760> run<00:02:19.120> it<00:02:19.240> through<00:02:19.270> the<00:02:19.540> machine

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
it and then run it through the machine

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.880 
it and then run it through the machine
what<00:02:22.060> I'll<00:02:22.210> do<00:02:22.420> this<00:02:22.930> time<00:02:23.230> though<00:02:23.440> or<00:02:23.770> at

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
what I'll do this time though or at

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.400 
what I'll do this time though or at
least<00:02:24.070> I<00:02:24.190> will<00:02:24.250> try<00:02:24.610> will<00:02:25.570> be<00:02:25.720> to<00:02:25.870> just<00:02:26.020> go<00:02:26.170> very

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
least I will try will be to just go very

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:32.310 
least I will try will be to just go very
very<00:02:26.710> slowly<00:02:27.220> and<00:02:27.580> carefully<00:02:30.810> how<00:02:31.810> and<00:02:32.140> where

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
very slowly and carefully how and where

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.790 
very slowly and carefully how and where
to<00:02:32.350> begin<00:02:33.450> because<00:02:34.450> really<00:02:34.990> if<00:02:35.230> the<00:02:35.500> needles

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
to begin because really if the needles

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.770 
to begin because really if the needles
were<00:02:35.950> pointed<00:02:36.370> in<00:02:36.550> that<00:02:36.940> would<00:02:37.060> be<00:02:37.209> better<00:02:37.360> but

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
were pointed in that would be better but

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.690 
were pointed in that would be better but
it<00:02:37.930> wouldn't<00:02:38.680> hold<00:02:38.860> the<00:02:39.070> shape<00:02:39.310> the<00:02:39.550> way<00:02:39.670> that

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
it wouldn't hold the shape the way that

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:45.000 
it wouldn't hold the shape the way that
I<00:02:39.850> want<00:02:41.040> so<00:02:43.080> let's<00:02:44.080> just<00:02:44.380> be<00:02:44.560> very<00:02:44.800> very

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
I want so let's just be very very

00:02:45.010 --> 00:03:22.390 
I want so let's just be very very
careful

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:29.830 

you

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:35.920 

and<00:03:30.880> as<00:03:31.880> luck<00:03:32.810> would<00:03:32.840> have<00:03:33.020> it<00:03:33.760> the<00:03:34.930> elastic

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
and as luck would have it the elastic

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.559 
and as luck would have it the elastic
that<00:03:36.080> will<00:03:36.140> use<00:03:36.500> to<00:03:36.830> stretch<00:03:37.489> around<00:03:38.000> the<00:03:38.390> back

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:38.569 
that will use to stretch around the back

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:41.290 
that will use to stretch around the back
of<00:03:38.599> the<00:03:38.780> head<00:03:39.020> we<00:03:39.890> can<00:03:40.099> use<00:03:40.280> to<00:03:40.520> hide<00:03:40.880> these

of the head we can use to hide these

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:46.150 
of the head we can use to hide these
little<00:03:42.790> sections<00:03:43.790> here<00:03:44.450> it<00:03:45.440> would<00:03:45.680> such<00:03:46.130> a

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
little sections here it would such a

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.670 
little sections here it would such a
fine<00:03:46.519> and<00:03:46.630> small<00:03:47.630> piece<00:03:47.810> of<00:03:47.840> fabric<00:03:47.959> I<00:03:48.410> didn't

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
under and I figured we'll just go ahead

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.780 
under and I figured we'll just go ahead
and<00:03:53.420> let<00:03:53.569> it<00:03:53.620> you<00:03:54.620> know<00:03:54.650> pray<00:03:55.099> there<00:03:55.370> because

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
and let it you know pray there because
