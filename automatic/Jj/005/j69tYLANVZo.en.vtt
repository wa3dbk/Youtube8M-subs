 Hello, everyone, my dear readers, everything.

 Good thing you guys are finally going to post more 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.330

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.099
 Were you missing me? I know. 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.009
 You 're also charging me a lot. 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:18.359
 and I decided to bring the prescription of the treatment 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:21.779
 and window is a pasta with a black eye 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:25.890
 the mayor of soybean with vegetables 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.720
 and with karim in honor of Mother's Day 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.060
 I'm going to make this dish but have the 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.539
 see this dish with Mother's Day nothing to 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.219
 to see 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.190
 in fact it's because I remembered a 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.920
 music called man wants the group uncle 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.559
 of which is a group of Korean key pop 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.870
 I found curious exhausted long ago 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.480
 back but very popular music very much 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.520
 famous was very successful and in the lyrics 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.920
 That song says that the mother does not like 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.289
 to travel better and everyone loves 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.449
 pasta and because Mom lies by 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.120

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.100
 Excitingly she saw in a room that 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.619
 money and not to eat out then 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.140
 mother saved all the money to 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.689
 be able to buy a shannon dish for the 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.549

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:17.280

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.610

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.040

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.079
 about one centimeter to one 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.119

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.220

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.630
 I have already cut my meat and vegetables and 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.190
 Now I'm going to prepare our eye. 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.750
 remembering that the right amount is 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.470
 whole in the video description of a 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.180
 checked 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.730
 now we can prepare our team 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.920
 ideal but we need to fry her but like 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.140
 so fry a raisin that we'll go 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.540
 fry passes soy is actually the 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.760
 most important step of this dish you 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.070
 bray your uncle well in taking 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.830

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:32.130
 I'm leaving, prepare by turning the fire underneath. 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:37.680
 vegetable oil 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:40.020
 we put our team longer need 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.670
 actually separate because I'm going to put 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.590
 everything in the frying pan right? 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.190
 Looks the folder does not mix with 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.190
 oil 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:57.000
 We'll take care of her for 15 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:57.960
 minutinhos take care not to let it 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.030
 burn 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:03.170
 Let's turn the fire off and I'll put 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.170
 also sugar 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.090
 I will lose the oil because I do not want to 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.810
 that my eye gets very soaked 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.810
 very greasy 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.570
 Ok, I'll come back here now. 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.050
 Now we'll start sautÃ©ing the 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.840
 our ingredients starting with 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:33.900

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:03.210
 zucchini 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.480
 This frying pan, which is already full 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:16.000
 but we worry that the return is over 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:18.489
 pulling on a little so now we 're going 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.010
 put that soy paste to us since we 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:24.210
 Revoke name will be fine and then we 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.210
 let's put water on 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:41.260
 the bench is too high for me to put 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.260
 Water 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:49.070

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.720
 ingredients want well cooked 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.440
 Meanwhile I 'm going to prepare my friend from 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:59.630
 potato or corn starch is dissolved 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:02.030

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:08.510
 spoons of starch with 4 tablespoons of water 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:10.760
 and dissolve well because it gave the 8 not 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:12.500
 we even had my ingredients 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.650

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:21.130

 kokas 4 tablespoons more or less 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:40.440

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:43.020
 world is ready we will boil to 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:45.060
 our water and cook our pasta if 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.250
 You already went to the grocery store to buy the team. 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:49.170
 Already then you will definitely buy the kit 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.640
 complete it will be the noodle 

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:51.990

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:55.320

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:02.070
 Broke totally wrong with the concierge 

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:05.220
 That I had to throw in the trash 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:07.080
 I spent two hours doing that and 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:10.050
 garden since I am honest with you see 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.970
 I admit wrong is not possible 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:14.190
 that pasta but needs a lot more 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:16.320
 a lot of practice to make it good 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:19.760
 So let's cook the pasta and then 

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.760
 I show you the final result. 

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:41.880

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:53.400
 half of my onion left in the water 

00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:55.770
 just to leave it so hot that we 

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:58.620

00:06:55.770 --> 00:07:01.350
 cubes to accompany along with tinga 

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:03.270
 This is already the raw even though it's not that 

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:05.040
 braised and can put up a little 

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:08.940
