00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:09.960
 hello backstage and hello follow 9 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.940
 tec duell the question this week 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.820
 What is better with smartphones 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.800
 lcd or holiday the answers to it 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.350
 do not deliver this week daniel and 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:24.350
 color but fan and cinema from the image 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.350
 in the department of ct film and a lot of fun 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.809
 the question is whether bolt or lcd handydisplays 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:36.840
 I can do better for myself 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.900
 for that I answer that clearly 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.149
 lcds those without friends tell me 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.110
 always rich colors beautiful black that 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.390
 may also be true 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.339
 but what bothers me is that due 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.530
 This rich color photos really 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:52.320
 totally after teletubbie bonbon world 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.000
 look and that I see that at all 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.829
 Not at all, so I can remember it 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.780
 remember that when I'm still alive 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.360
 Unfortunately, I have ne cd at the moment 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.140
 cellphone the nexus fourth but as me only 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.850
 the oled cellphone had the galaxy nexus 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.189
 I even have my vacation photos on 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.770
 my mobile played the photos on me 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.439
 to look at this little display and 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.820
 I 've had a really fun time 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.710
 and I did not feel that way 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.390
 that somehow it teletubbie land 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.409
 but that was right 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.869
 nice if you only 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:26.729
 lcd monitors is used then it is 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.490
 Of course, this is a bit unusual 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.079
 this these rich colors but it looks 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.759
 just better off and see mine 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:39.030
 opinion not wrong from it like it 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.950
 not at all and a whole 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.429
 important point in my eyes 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.960
 is speaking now comes the penta matrix 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:48.119
 I already know that he is the 8 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.740
 that these displays are usually no 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.960
 rgb matrix but have a band 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.210
 tricks and that's why you 'll see letters and 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.920
 basically somehow 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.770
 frayed out and have so easy 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.780
 they look frayed too 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.639
 but from a certain resolution is 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.619
 that no longer a problem with the clear 

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:06.630
 were the next 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:08.100
 what stefan and not because earlier times 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.090
 that was right on it 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.610
 that was really annoying 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.430
 but as I said from 720p resolution and 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.830
 especially from full hd 1080p resolution 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.240
 it just no longer a problem 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.410
 and that can tell stephanie can 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.660
 he also does not see and 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.970
 colored hem on the edges and the 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.160
 makes me crazy insane 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.780
 now the ole advocates so from 300 dpi 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.230
 You would not even do that at all 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.140
 see 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.500
 I see it synonymous with high-resolution 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.310
 still displays 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.860
 Maybe it can be that is at 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.090
 galaxy s 4 with more than 460 dpi no longer 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.250
 but I will be so clear 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.170
 that's gonna see there too and that 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.180
 he probably sees if one 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.840
 lupe takes and select see and 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:53.610
 but still fumble the benefits over 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.610
 Most of me are also annoying there 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:04.140
 It's better to simply get better 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.140
 do not discuss about it 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:15.340
 I need a bolt or lcd at all 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:17.319
 not think makes foreign 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.310
 and because lcd really easy for me 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:23.440
 only disadvantages has the black 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:27.430
 silvery spongy and beautiful 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:30.220
 the colors are so that is whole 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.379
 You always have a typical genolier 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.239
 Everyone had this black one 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:36.760
 together better black value but what 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.500
 brings me that when I call the phone 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.810
 but he stays outside of the contrast 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.390
 anyway not much about and cds is running in 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.500
 usually much brighter than oleds have there 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.090
 I prefer a display what is outside 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.790
 good reading and then what not 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.220
 but so strong is contra well that he must 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.170
 even know poppen not right and 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.629
 Above all, it is depending on whether 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.370
 I upside down one way or the other I constantly 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:04:00.519
 it changes something on the black and on the 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:03.069
 colors that annoys me totally and brings is 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:06.760
 simply black is black lamp is 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:09.489
 Out of top the colors look right 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.810
 really nice to see from the colors 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:13.599
 Fashion is not really nice at all 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.849
 looks colors are just totally up 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:17.500
 to the stop 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:19.510
 brightly colored and every photo looks easy 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.630
 unnatural if i have any app 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.220
 see open my view show all gray 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.169
 also totally colorful and that is 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.330
 no argument at all if so 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:31.030
 we have an unnatural appearance 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:33.660
 are obvious now but that is 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:36.910
 the slightly better lcgb much nicer and 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.250
 that's really alive that's right 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.270
 beautiful 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:43.690
 In addition, viewing angles are not dependent 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:45.220
 and the only drawbacks are the homes 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.020
 I would be so dependent on perspective 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.880
 even not at all 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.470
 So I saw everything that was like that 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.729
 such an angle depends on me 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.930
 it has only become bad 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:55.449
 a little bit tilted on and that are 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.160
 immediately turned green or purple that it 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:05:00.160
 In my eyes, no question at all 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.780
 In terms of technology, there are good lcds and also 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.300
 good and just as there are before 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:07.419
 perspective-dependent or lcds but that 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:11.590
 there is no principle-related question left 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:13.630
 the resolution since 720p not already 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:16.050
 more and above all, I see her 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:18.300
 a full hd display like the 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.340
 galaxy s no longer at all 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.150
 that's why it only really works for me 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.669
 advantages 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:26.159
 So if genom that he is the penta 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:27.720
 matrix somehow full hd no more 

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:29.370
 then I could really see him there 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.870
 just to congratulate but i have 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.520
 obviously better eyes and me 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:36.389
 See it very well and it just bothers 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:38.370
 even if he does not mean to see it and 

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:41.629
 I would like a lcd display at the moment 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:41.629
 just do not have 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.590
 well who won was who was right
