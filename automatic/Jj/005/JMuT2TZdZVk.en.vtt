00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:38.740 
becomes nocturnal I think she has a

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.710 
becomes nocturnal I think she has a
different<00:05:38.919> perspective<00:05:39.160> than<00:05:39.850> I<00:05:40.030> do<00:05:40.090> our

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:40.720 
different perspective than I do our

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.990

moved here two years ago so I think from

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.610 
moved here two years ago so I think from
an<00:05:46.449> outsider's<00:05:46.900> perspective<00:05:47.080> this<00:05:47.560> is
