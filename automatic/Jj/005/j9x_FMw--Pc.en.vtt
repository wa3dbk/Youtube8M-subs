00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
I'm just really lazy and then I'm

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.200 
I'm just really lazy and then I'm
pouring<00:01:51.230> in<00:01:51.350> some<00:01:51.590> sugar<00:01:51.950> and<00:01:52.250> for<00:01:52.760> this<00:01:52.970> I

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
pouring in some sugar and for this I

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.970 
pouring in some sugar and for this I
don't<00:01:53.300> have<00:01:53.540> any<00:01:53.870> measurements<00:01:54.590> I'm<00:01:54.710> kind<00:01:54.920> of

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:54.980 
don't have any measurements I'm kind of

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.160 
don't have any measurements I'm kind of
eyeballing<00:01:55.190> everything<00:01:56.090> you<00:01:56.540> really<00:01:56.900> can't

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
eyeballing everything you really can't

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.840 
eyeballing everything you really can't
add<00:01:57.350> too<00:01:57.620> much<00:01:57.740> of<00:01:57.920> any<00:01:58.040> ingredient<00:01:58.640> when<00:01:58.730> it

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
add too much of any ingredient when it

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.370 
add too much of any ingredient when it
comes<00:01:58.880> to<00:01:59.150> this<00:01:59.270> because<00:01:59.570> it's<00:01:59.690> only<00:01:59.840> oil<00:02:00.110> and

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
comes to this because it's only oil and

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.280 
comes to this because it's only oil and
sugar<00:02:00.560> and<00:02:00.980> if<00:02:01.910> you<00:02:02.090> realize<00:02:02.780> that<00:02:02.810> you<00:02:02.990> poured

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
sugar and if you realize that you poured

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.690 
sugar and if you realize that you poured
too<00:02:03.380> much<00:02:03.410> sugar<00:02:03.770> you<00:02:03.860> can<00:02:04.070> just<00:02:04.190> add<00:02:04.280> more<00:02:04.430> oil

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
too much sugar you can just add more oil

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.250 
too much sugar you can just add more oil
and<00:02:05.060> if<00:02:05.150> you<00:02:05.270> realize<00:02:05.510> before<00:02:05.840> too<00:02:05.960> much<00:02:06.050> oil

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
and if you realize before too much oil

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.990 
and if you realize before too much oil
you<00:02:06.470> can<00:02:06.590> just<00:02:06.770> add<00:02:06.890> more<00:02:07.070> sugar<00:02:07.280> so<00:02:07.970> you

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
you can just add more sugar so you

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.070 
you can just add more sugar so you
really<00:02:08.420> don't<00:02:08.570> need<00:02:08.690> to<00:02:08.810> use<00:02:08.929> any

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
really don't need to use any

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.680 
really don't need to use any
measurements<00:02:09.740> and<00:02:09.950> then<00:02:10.610> using<00:02:10.940> some<00:02:11.150> coconut

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
measurements and then using some coconut

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.220 
measurements and then using some coconut
oil<00:02:11.840> I'm<00:02:12.230> using<00:02:12.260> a<00:02:12.680> round<00:02:13.010> two<00:02:14.230> tablespoons

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
oil I'm using a round two tablespoons

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.080 
oil I'm using a round two tablespoons
but<00:02:15.530> like<00:02:15.650> I<00:02:15.770> said<00:02:15.830> I'm<00:02:16.130> not<00:02:16.160> using<00:02:16.520> any<00:02:16.760> real

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
but like I said I'm not using any real

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.500 
but like I said I'm not using any real
measurements<00:02:17.780> for<00:02:17.990> this<00:02:19.000> and<00:02:20.000> I'm<00:02:20.120> going<00:02:20.330> to

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
measurements for this and I'm going to

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.870 
measurements for this and I'm going to
put<00:02:20.720> that<00:02:20.870> in<00:02:20.990> the<00:02:21.110> microwave<00:02:21.650> for<00:02:21.860> 20<00:02:22.310> seconds

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
put that in the microwave for 20 seconds

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.780 
put that in the microwave for 20 seconds
to<00:02:23.150> melt<00:02:23.420> it<00:02:23.690> so<00:02:23.930> that<00:02:24.860> it's<00:02:24.980> a<00:02:25.070> liquid<00:02:25.490> and

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
to melt it so that it's a liquid and

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.190 
to melt it so that it's a liquid and
then<00:02:25.940> I'm<00:02:26.060> just<00:02:26.180> going<00:02:26.360> to<00:02:26.480> pour<00:02:26.750> into<00:02:26.959> the

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
then I'm just going to pour into the

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.710 
then I'm just going to pour into the
mixture<00:02:27.620> of<00:02:27.860> sugar<00:02:28.250> and<00:02:28.610> I'm<00:02:29.060> going<00:02:29.090> to<00:02:29.420> blend

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
mixture of sugar and I'm going to blend

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:35.320 
mixture of sugar and I'm going to blend
it<00:02:32.560> I'm<00:02:33.560> also<00:02:33.800> adding<00:02:34.070> more<00:02:34.400> sugar<00:02:34.730> so<00:02:34.910> that<00:02:35.180> I

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
it I'm also adding more sugar so that I

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.330 
it I'm also adding more sugar so that I
actually<00:02:35.570> have<00:02:35.930> more<00:02:36.320> of<00:02:36.530> body<00:02:36.770> scrub<00:02:37.190> because

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
actually have more of body scrub because

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.250 
actually have more of body scrub because
I<00:02:37.670> realized<00:02:38.090> Midway<00:02:38.600> that<00:02:38.840> I<00:02:38.870> didn't<00:02:39.110> have

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
I realized Midway that I didn't have

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:52.449 
I realized Midway that I didn't have
enough

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.070 

it<00:02:53.459> should<00:02:53.670> be<00:02:53.790> kind<00:02:53.909> of<00:02:54.030> like<00:02:54.120> a<00:02:54.180> damp<00:02:54.510> mixture

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
it should be kind of like a damp mixture

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.080 
it should be kind of like a damp mixture
as<00:02:55.379> of<00:02:55.650> right<00:02:55.830> now<00:02:56.010> and<00:02:56.280> then<00:02:56.730> next<00:02:56.909> I'm

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
as of right now and then next I'm

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.449 
as of right now and then next I'm
getting<00:02:57.330> some<00:02:57.599> almond<00:02:58.080> oil<00:02:58.379> and<00:02:58.739> I'm<00:02:58.830> going<00:02:59.099> to

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
getting some almond oil and I'm going to

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:15.520 
getting some almond oil and I'm going to
be<00:02:59.849> adding<00:03:00.540> that<00:03:00.569> into<00:03:01.019> the<00:03:01.140> mixture<00:03:01.409> as<00:03:01.620> well

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.680 

and<00:03:16.530> now<00:03:17.220> I'm<00:03:17.370> using<00:03:17.579> my<00:03:17.730> peppermint

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
and now I'm using my peppermint

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
roughly 11 drops of this and this is for

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099 
you don't need that for this mixture so

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:48.530 
you don't need that for this mixture so

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
you don't have to go out and buy that if

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.089 
you don't have to go out and buy that if
you<00:03:48.629> don't<00:03:48.750> already<00:03:48.959> have<00:03:49.109> it<00:03:49.290> it's<00:03:49.769> just<00:03:49.980> one

you don't already have it it's just one

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:51.259 
you don't already have it it's just one
of<00:03:50.129> those<00:03:50.250> things<00:03:50.459> aren't<00:03:50.609> where<00:03:50.790> I<00:03:50.849> already

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
of those things aren't where I already

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.000 
of those things aren't where I already
had<00:03:51.480> in<00:03:51.660> my<00:03:51.750> house<00:03:51.959> so<00:03:52.379> I<00:03:52.440> figured<00:03:52.680> I<00:03:52.739> would<00:03:52.769> use

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
had in my house so I figured I would use

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.580 
had in my house so I figured I would use
it<00:03:53.190> next<00:03:54.030> I'm<00:03:54.120> getting<00:03:54.359> some<00:03:54.569> water<00:03:54.930> and<00:03:55.349> then

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
it next I'm getting some water and then

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.800 
it next I'm getting some water and then
using<00:03:55.980> some<00:03:56.340> soap<00:03:56.700> colorant<00:03:57.209> in<00:03:57.419> the<00:03:57.630> color

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
using some soap colorant in the color

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.699 
using some soap colorant in the color
wine<00:03:58.200> I'm<00:03:58.560> going<00:03:59.040> to<00:03:59.340> add<00:03:59.609> that<00:03:59.880> to<00:03:59.940> the<00:04:00.180> water

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
wine I'm going to add that to the water

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:03.349 
wine I'm going to add that to the water
so<00:04:01.709> that<00:04:01.859> I<00:04:01.889> can<00:04:02.190> add<00:04:02.340> that<00:04:02.549> to<00:04:02.609> the<00:04:02.819> mixture<00:04:03.090> to

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:03.359 
so that I can add that to the mixture to

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:06.610 
so that I can add that to the mixture to
make<00:04:03.389> it<00:04:03.660> more<00:04:04.160> red<00:04:05.160> again<00:04:05.549> this<00:04:05.880> part<00:04:06.209> is<00:04:06.419> not

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
make it more red again this part is not

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.809 
make it more red again this part is not
necessary<00:04:07.620> either<00:04:07.799> I'm<00:04:08.220> just<00:04:08.430> doing<00:04:08.700> it<00:04:08.790> to

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:08.819 
necessary either I'm just doing it to

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:11.449 
necessary either I'm just doing it to
darken<00:04:09.180> up<00:04:09.239> the<00:04:09.359> color<00:04:09.569> a<00:04:09.660> little<00:04:09.810> bit<00:04:10.310> you<00:04:11.310> can

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
darken up the color a little bit you can
