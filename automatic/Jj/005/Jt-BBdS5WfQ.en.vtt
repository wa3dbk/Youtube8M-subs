00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:10.080
 hello sprit simon from a bodybuilding 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.730
 DE in this video I'll give you a few 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.110
 kids you pay attention to when shopping 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.839
 should be sure your will sport 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.430
 It certainly achieves its goals clearly 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.890
 that the nutrition of the diet 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.130
 has a decisive influence on whether 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.390
 you reach your athletic goals 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.820
 regardless it is now whether one 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.740
 defined sportive goal 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.210
 to become slimmer or to become 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.430
 a sporting goal is perhaps 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.309
 to gain muscle mass gain 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.329
 and just to see muscular house 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:37.620
 regardless of a sporting goal 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.450
 is definitely clear that the 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.059
 nutritionally quite relevant 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.680
 the diet has an effect on this 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.140
 Of course what's in our life one 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.090
 plays an essential role and that is why 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.950
 the food procurement speaks that 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.539
 shopping is also a very important act in 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.010
 your life and as such an important one 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.760
 you should act pleasurable shopping yet 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.160
 consider 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.960
 So I'll give you the first tip 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.670
 when you go shopping you concentrate 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.770
 you please to 100 percent on the 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.840
 For example, I buy mine 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.890
 cell phone out I am currently not for 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.600
 others reachable 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.490
 I'm not thinking about it 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.320
 problems or with any things 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.850
 namely when I shop 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.950
 go then I go shopping and 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.229
 focus on nothing else than 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.670
 on the food on the purchase and 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.009
 on what I need what I need 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.380
 and ultimately buy purposefully 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.170
 strategy seems to be my first type 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.520
 Schenker is the not on the shopping 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.070
 one hundred percent attention and 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.170
 my second tip is organize yours 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.689
 Shopping means you should 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.189
 take a piece of paper would be on you 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.259
 what foods do you write 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.150
 buy and ultimately you make yourself 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.009
 when creating the z is of course already 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.470
 thoughts which sporting goal 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.119
 is that when you build up mass 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.829
 if you want to gain muscle 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.360
 Of course, you would like to buy a lot 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.659
 carbohydrates rich nutrition medium 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.729
 on 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.259
 if you want to lose weight if you are 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.820
 Do you want to get leaner? 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.740
 Of course, best of all the low carb diet 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.700
 that means you buy low in carbohydrates 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.250
 food 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.110
 Far too often from sports friends that they 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.450
 just stuffing sweets into it 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.280
 or just had something to eat 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.630
 actually did not want to eat and she 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.310
 resent that the 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.759
 finally the inner pig dog 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.349
 Not 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.269
 she came and then actually to the closet 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.650
 gone or to the fridge and 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:15.420
 have just these unhealthy 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.010
 foodstuffs taken over it 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.209
 then often the sin 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.250
 quotation marks 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.329
 I ask completely where else I ask 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.950
 not at all why do not you have that 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:24.420
 I can resist but I ask 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.519
 always why do you have that chase 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.110
 Purchased the purchase decides 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:30.540
 ultimately, if you are things 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.549
 or not what you buy 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.079
 Of course you eat when you are chocolate pudding 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:35.670
 cops then you will someday this 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:37.859
 chocolate pudding, of course 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.870
 Also eat if you buy chocolate then 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:41.579
 you will eat them and if you are cute 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.409
 like gummy bears chips and so on 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:45.000
 course then you will of course also this 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:47.159
 eat food because you have it then 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.049
 bought you have money for it is paid 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:51.540
 not that it spoils because of that 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:53.519
 it goes without saying that they eat it 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.440
 means when shopping decides whether 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.450
 you want to take later you something is 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.500
 or not what you do not know you can not 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.940
 Eating is so easy 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.319
 ultimately been my tip it 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.730
 That's why you should get a plan 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.620
 do what you do with yours 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.239
 nutritionally you should pay attention 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.400
 should the thoughts do what you need 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.540
 you also what should you do without and 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.879
 what could possibly be small 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.370
 his rewards that is little things 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:15.660
 which you then from and to you then take over 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.459
 to reward you a little bit 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.440
 can sometimes distract certainly 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.790
 even small sins in everyday life be there 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.260
 You do not have to worry about that too 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.810
 Entertain is completely on the crowd 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.220
 to the masses it is finally allowed 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.930
 Of course you also buy a few things 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.040
 they just taste good and 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.690
 maybe not quite as healthy 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.489
 as long as that in measure and not in masses 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.989
 of course you should too 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:35.040
 When shopping always pay attention to what 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.410
 is included in the food 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.049
 for example, these finished bags otherwise 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.489
 read the times is written on it 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:42.650
 flavor enhancer monosodium glutamate 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:45.000
 then you let it wake up in many 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.680
 diet products is precisely aspartame indoors 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.449
 the trust us on the sweetener of 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.250
 is controversial I buy that 

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:52.109
 occasionally but not too rough 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.400
 Of course, it means I pay attention, of course 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:55.319
 let it be that as possible without asphalt 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.459
 Of course that's what sweetened it, too 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:58.829
 even the little things you do when 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:00.540
 You can consider purchasing when shopping 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:02.699
 can decide to completely 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.129
 especially healthy lifestyle 

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:06.959
 and of course you were thinking of what you did 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:09.440
 buy because you are what you eat and 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:11.669
 In the end, you should act that too 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.169
 Finally, we hold you tight 

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:15.510
 please concentrate when shopping 

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:17.700
 to 100 percent on the purchase you make 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.780
 the please in the run of purchasing 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:22.000
 Thoughts about what you need was 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.620
 you definitely do not need and on what 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.060
 you should abstain and then cook 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.830
 according to the specifications a 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.030
 and the third part is on you 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.560
 you should look out for the 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.880
 Just take a closer look at the food 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.590
 maybe food too 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.270
 duh which purchased for months for years 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.340
 do not say so with even questioning 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.139
 times your previous nutritional behavior 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.419
 and shopping behavior and look at the 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:41.440
 products exactly 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:42.910
 that was as far from me as she was 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.110
 now for the next part would be happy 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:48.180
 if not a positive rating 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.180
 from dirk rule many greetings simon
