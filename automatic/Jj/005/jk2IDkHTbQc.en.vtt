00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.040
 every now and then we can stay owes us every 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.300
 let's say game where maybe 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.330
 certain episodes have been committed 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.179
 of errors must serve to grow to 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.130
 grow then we have to take in 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:21.330
 we say this sense but I don't think so 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:24.900
 when if your opinion is this 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.820
 respect, however, I believe that when not 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.349
 there is balance 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.810
 maybe the team puts you under the 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.239
 team continually creates from the point 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.120
 of game view who is superior to this 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.170
 maybe we have n't seen so much seen 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.440
 that the team did a good one 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.390
 performance we conceded goals 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.140
 certainly there have been mistakes 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:49.079
 however the team we say has never been 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.030
 in numerical or even inferior inferiority 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.850
 at the last goal we have always been in 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.010
 superiority 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.930
 league compared to the opponents so they are 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.250
 of carelessness that happens to us 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.070
 but they also happen to the other teams 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.640
 every goal you take is always there 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:05.619
 even an error rate maybe 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.790
 in our case in the same action ce 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:09.990
 there have been more than one 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:12.159
 but I repeat that they are episodes in my opinion 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.490
 they can and must be circumscribed 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:17.640
 improve because they are 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:21.039
 carelessness that we can say so 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:24.520
 be limited with more application 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:27.399
 so I repeat we must raise a lot 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.649
 the attention bar in 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:31.659
 certain game situations here 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:32.520
 because sometimes the ardor of wanting to win 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:36.130
 at all costs 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.869
 yes yes you do leave us some problem is 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:42.759
 then mascara 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:46.270
 will make it no for Saturday no for Tuesday 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:48.490
 I think so because he has no problems from 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.340
 controls has neither a little fatigued 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.289
 so it is useless to risk the problem 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.860
 which then give it the role of 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:58.960
 cutolo that where we say so yes 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.850
 expresses better you can also fit in 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.680
 some other role though if it doesn't have 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.649
 play but also because of this over 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.930
 which also had physical problems though that 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:10.929
 I see tomorrow he is available 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:13.030
 piscitella we have other solutions 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.879
 everything is possible like all games 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:19.180
 are important French checks 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:21.370
 I don't know why but what changed up 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.579
 to the game we did some 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.500
 common for a match in this mi 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:27.849
 I ask therefore we have indeed there is the 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.400
 game of varese because it said one 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:33.579
 verifies not a verification because after a 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.469
 Pre league and Italian Cup all the 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:37.659
 team has always expressed good also 

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:39.639
 when we weren't brilliant because 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:41.379
 we lost a game and there too 

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:43.510
 deservedly because the draw there 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:46.239
 it was all I don't see why 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.919
 checks are important, all included 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:50.680
 that of Sunday and last Saturday that 

00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:52.569
 we did at varese and all the others 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:58.030
 which will hold in a verification bar and one 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:03:00.280
 check avellino because it allows us to 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.310
 check where we are here is how 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:06.219
 as mentality as growth as every 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:09.340
 so these these highs and lows we say 

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:10.500
 in the concentration that clearly in 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.210
 this sense 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.200
 he left us and made us leave 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:18.510
 a few points, however, I repeat the team 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.920
 always works with the same intensity and 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.690
 with the same desire that we put 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.190
 last week then by a 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.500
 week to the other 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.310
 I do not believe that they can be changed in this way 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:31.230
 so much from the evaluations therefore us 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.060
 on the outside it is clear that he can and rethink 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:36.200
 everything is right to think just not 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.610
 he wanted to lie in the same balance 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.740
 as we have done so far I have not said 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.320
 this I said the role of kudo 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:44.730
 where it is expressed best and that, however, me 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.590
 to ragusa 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.390
 we did play everywhere and 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.840
 normal that a player should know 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:54.900
 also adapt to other roles 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:57.209
 if maybe we don't have an exterior col 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.310
 role reversed but maybe we play 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.980
 ten are not starting in Rome 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.630
 someone called politano game in no is there 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.370
 well visit of available I said 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:08.280
 before that there is also piscitella that too 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.739
 he is a wing and he is not a foot 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.500
 invert companies and effects something 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:15.060
 that the bari was accomplished marine one 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.100
 tested group 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.410
 yes I said it before because they have so many 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:22.410
 last season's elements a group 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:24.870
 who knows how to fight because he has always left 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:27.040
 the last few years with the handicap and it is 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.050
 always managed to get 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.150
 have excellent results 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:34.030
 right mindset in the category then 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.620
 a team that did have lost 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.990
 only once of these sources also 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.880
 in practice if I'm not mistaken so it's a 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.430
 difficult opponent as I said before 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.650
 as titled but in practice I said it 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:47.470
 first up to the croton match 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.540
 not making an exceptional match like 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.430
 brilliance for all reasons 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:54.460
 which we said the team created 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:57.640
 really many goal balls and suffered 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.890
 like balls very few goals so even a 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.480
 varese beyond the opportunities that 

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:03.280
 have had and have not transformed me 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.710
 looks like they put us under from 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.780
 point of view of the game and also there us 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.000
 we have created so much the team 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:13.000
 how performance has always made it to 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.800
 Sometimes mistakes are made like that 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.720
 everyone else may have been 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.180
 in this circumstance more cynical and 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:21.640
 varese to exploit almost all not not 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:24.550
 I know they are all available or not 

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:26.770
 I do not think that in the group the 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:29.050
 born must not evaluate holder or diesel 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.580
 and evaluate all the players and get them 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.950
 play as someone who is better 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:35.350
 evaluate his physical condition 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:37.450
 answers that in short remained a bit 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:40.780
 piqued by a few comments during the week 

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:44.860
 not from no to no I have not followed any 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:48.659
 no transmission a following why 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:51.699
 that is, I only think about working so it's not 

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:54.400
 the work we do must 

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:56.139
 getting used to is not that everyone should 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.280
 agree on what we do 

00:05:56.139 --> 00:05:59.289
 or we say 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.240
 we have taken applause without 

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:02.620
 prove nothing so if there are any 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.960
 criticism is also good 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:08.069
 we must always try to do 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.069
 better in the field
