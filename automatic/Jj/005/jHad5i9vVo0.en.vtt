these three notes and you'll see them
light<00:01:10.979> up<00:01:11.130> over<00:01:11.400> here<00:01:11.930> CDE<00:01:12.930> or<00:01:13.560> channel<00:01:13.950> 1<00:01:14.130> 2<00:01:14.430> 3

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
light up over here CDE or channel 1 2 3

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.960 
light up over here CDE or channel 1 2 3
and<00:01:15.240> that<00:01:15.840> goes<00:01:16.049> all<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.470> way<00:01:16.680> up<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.280> channel

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
and that goes all the way up to channel

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:18.950 
and that goes all the way up to channel
16

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
16

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.499 
16
so<00:01:19.200> just<00:01:19.740> channel<00:01:20.070> 1<00:01:20.250> 2<00:01:20.820> 3<00:01:21.210> 4<00:01:21.659> 5<00:01:21.930> 6<00:01:22.350> 7<00:01:22.680> 8<00:01:23.009> 9<00:01:23.369> 10<00:01:24.270> 11

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
so just channel 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.880 
so just channel 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
12<00:01:24.900> 13<00:01:25.200> 14<00:01:25.680> 15<00:01:26.159> 16<00:01:26.900> all<00:01:27.900> individually

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
12 13 14 15 16 all individually

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.240 
12 13 14 15 16 all individually
controlled<00:01:29.579> on<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.150> keyboard<00:01:30.920> no<00:01:31.920> it's

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
controlled on the keyboard no it's

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.730 
controlled on the keyboard no it's
really<00:01:32.490> neat<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:33.090> little<00:01:33.930> more<00:01:34.049> practical<00:01:34.530> is

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
really neat a little more practical is

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.080 
really neat a little more practical is
being<00:01:34.979> able<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.220> trigger<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.850> chase

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
being able to trigger the chase

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.050 
being able to trigger the chase
sequences<00:01:36.810> from<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.110> keyboard<00:01:37.700> and<00:01:38.700> just<00:01:38.939> for

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
sequences from the keyboard and just for

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.270 
sequences from the keyboard and just for
the<00:01:39.180> sake<00:01:39.390> of<00:01:39.600> trying<00:01:40.020> this<00:01:40.229> out<00:01:40.439> I<00:01:40.710> put<00:01:41.100> them

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
the sake of trying this out I put them

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.060 
the sake of trying this out I put them
on<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:42.030> couple<00:01:43.020> notes<00:01:43.200> down<00:01:43.590> here<00:01:43.860> at<00:01:43.950> the

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
on a couple notes down here at the

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.160 
on a couple notes down here at the
bottom<00:01:44.369> of<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.549> keyboard<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:45.570> you'll<00:01:45.840> see

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
bottom of the keyboard and you'll see

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.270 
bottom of the keyboard and you'll see
what<00:01:46.439> they<00:01:46.590> do<00:01:46.649> over<00:01:46.890> here<00:01:48.560> nice<00:01:49.560> slow<00:01:49.920> chase

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
what they do over here nice slow chase

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.780 
what they do over here nice slow chase
all<00:01:50.850> 16<00:01:51.420> channels<00:01:51.899> a<00:01:52.439> little<00:01:53.040> faster<00:01:53.520> chase

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
all 16 channels a little faster chase

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.010 
all 16 channels a little faster chase
and<00:01:54.360> then<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.750> same<00:01:55.020> thing<00:01:55.320> in<00:01:55.470> Reverse

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
and then the same thing in Reverse

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.980 
and then the same thing in Reverse
and<00:01:57.170> by<00:01:57.710> combining<00:01:58.130> these<00:01:58.430> we<00:01:58.670> can<00:01:58.820> get<00:01:59.000> some

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
and by combining these we can get some

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.020 
and by combining these we can get some
different<00:02:00.290> neat<00:02:00.710> effects<00:02:03.880> kind<00:02:04.880> of

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
different neat effects kind of

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.160 
different neat effects kind of
impressive<00:02:06.100> with<00:02:07.100> very<00:02:07.850> little<00:02:08.149> effort<00:02:08.599> I

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
impressive with very little effort I

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.300 
impressive with very little effort I
mean<00:02:09.530> while<00:02:09.679> I'm<00:02:09.739> doing<00:02:10.009> is<00:02:10.130> pressing

that<00:02:47.720> just<00:02:48.049> about<00:02:48.260> anybody<00:02:48.769> could<00:02:49.100> press<00:02:49.400> keys

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
the time of music and I don't have to

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:55.770 
the time of music and I don't have to
spend<00:02:53.569> endless<00:02:53.959> hours<00:02:54.350> programming<00:02:54.920> a

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
spend endless hours programming a

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.100 
spend endless hours programming a
grid-based<00:02:57.250> sequencing<00:02:58.250> program<00:02:58.900> so<00:02:59.900> let<00:03:00.019> me

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
grid-based sequencing program so let me

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.890 
grid-based sequencing program so let me
show<00:03:00.290> you<00:03:00.349> a<00:03:00.500> quick<00:03:00.890> little<00:03:00.920> demo<00:03:01.250> I<00:03:01.579> did<00:03:02.650> and

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
show you a quick little demo I did and

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.440 
show you a quick little demo I did and
that<00:03:05.900> way<00:03:06.400> you'll<00:03:07.400> get<00:03:07.519> an<00:03:07.640> idea<00:03:07.970> how<00:03:08.150> this<00:03:08.269> it

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
that way you'll get an idea how this it

00:03:08.450 --> 00:05:23.960 
that way you'll get an idea how this it
all<00:03:08.570> come<00:03:08.780> together

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:23.970 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:28.500 

that<00:05:24.970> was<00:05:25.780> done<00:05:26.020> in<00:05:26.560> real<00:05:27.070> time<00:05:27.340> a<00:05:27.730> lot<00:05:28.360> what

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:28.510 
that was done in real time a lot what

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.300 
that was done in real time a lot what
you<00:05:28.630> watch<00:05:28.810> but<00:05:29.110> I<00:05:29.170> recorded<00:05:29.740> that<00:05:29.920> in<00:05:30.100> real

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.310 
you watch but I recorded that in real

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:33.450 
you watch but I recorded that in real
time<00:05:30.520> before<00:05:30.990> I<00:05:31.990> know<00:05:32.710> it's<00:05:32.950> not<00:05:33.070> great<00:05:33.310> but

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460 
time before I know it's not great but

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.450 
time before I know it's not great but
it's<00:05:33.760> just<00:05:34.000> very<00:05:34.750> simple<00:05:35.050> and<00:05:35.980> all<00:05:36.070> I<00:05:36.190> wanted

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:36.460 
it's just very simple and all I wanted

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.490 
it's just very simple and all I wanted
to<00:05:36.580> prove<00:05:36.850> was<00:05:37.060> you<00:05:37.270> could<00:05:37.450> trigger<00:05:37.660> sequences

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.500 
to prove was you could trigger sequences

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.000 
to prove was you could trigger sequences
chases<00:05:39.750> individual<00:05:40.750> channels<00:05:41.230> with<00:05:41.470> keyboard

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.010 
chases individual channels with keyboard

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:44.340 
chases individual channels with keyboard
record<00:05:42.670> it<00:05:42.790> in<00:05:42.850> lifetime<00:05:43.330> and<00:05:43.720> end<00:05:44.020> up<00:05:44.140> with<00:05:44.320> a

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:44.350 
record it in lifetime and end up with a

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:45.990 
record it in lifetime and end up with a
pretty<00:05:44.560> nice<00:05:44.740> show<00:05:45.010> with<00:05:45.340> very<00:05:45.610> little<00:05:45.790> effort

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 
pretty nice show with very little effort

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.620 
pretty nice show with very little effort
so<00:05:46.630> that's<00:05:47.050> it<00:05:47.200> for<00:05:47.350> this<00:05:47.470> video
