00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
okay so this move is going to music with

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.710 
okay so this move is going to music with
a<00:00:19.080> little<00:00:19.380> bit<00:00:19.500> faster<00:00:19.920> would<00:00:20.100> be<00:00:20.160> so<00:00:20.820> genres

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720

let<00:00:27.180> me<00:00:27.240> bring<00:00:27.420> this<00:00:27.599> move<00:00:27.930> down<00:00:28.140> for<00:00:28.529> you

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
let me bring this move down for you

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.589 
let me bring this move down for you
there<00:00:29.220> are<00:00:29.340> two<00:00:29.519> different<00:00:29.910> movements<00:00:30.330> first

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
there are two different movements first

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.269 
there are two different movements first
of<00:00:30.779> all<00:00:30.869> we<00:00:31.019> have<00:00:31.170> two<00:00:31.289> step<00:00:31.590> touch<00:00:31.859> motion

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
of all we have two step touch motion

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:38.000 
of all we have two step touch motion
which<00:00:32.520> looks<00:00:32.790> like<00:00:32.940> this<00:00:33.149> 1<00:00:33.840> &amp;<00:00:34.260> 2<00:00:35.090> 1<00:00:36.090> &amp;<00:00:36.260> 2<00:00:37.260> so

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
which looks like this 1 &amp; 2 1 &amp; 2 so

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:45.920 
which looks like this 1 &amp; 2 1 &amp; 2 so
notice<00:00:38.640> I'm<00:00:38.879> stepping<00:00:39.360> on<00:00:41.690> 1<00:00:42.690> 2<00:00:43.290> 1<00:00:44.070> 2<00:00:44.309> 1<00:00:44.940> 2

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
notice I'm stepping on 1 2 1 2 1 2

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.889 
notice I'm stepping on 1 2 1 2 1 2
I'm<00:00:46.379> going<00:00:46.739> 1<00:00:47.280> &amp;<00:00:47.760> 2<00:00:48.350> 1<00:00:49.350> &amp;<00:00:49.410> 2<00:00:50.030> so<00:00:51.030> it's<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.660> little

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
I'm going 1 &amp; 2 1 &amp; 2 so it's a little

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.139 
I'm going 1 &amp; 2 1 &amp; 2 so it's a little
bit<00:00:51.989> faster<00:00:52.199> ok<00:00:53.070> so<00:00:53.460> that<00:00:53.640> is<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.940> first

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
bit faster ok so that is the first

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.990 
bit faster ok so that is the first
movement<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.780> fast<00:00:55.110> step<00:00:56.010> touch<00:00:56.309> motion

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
movement the fast step touch motion

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.630 
movement the fast step touch motion
deceptive<00:00:57.840> motion<00:00:58.230> here<00:00:58.530> is<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:59.370> swing

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
deceptive motion here is the swing

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.900 
deceptive motion here is the swing
motion<00:00:59.910> now<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:00.660> looks<00:01:00.809> like<00:01:00.899> this<00:01:01.730> I'm<00:01:02.730> gonna

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
motion now it looks like this I'm gonna

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.119 
motion now it looks like this I'm gonna
get<00:01:03.120> into<00:01:03.480> it<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.840> little<00:01:04.199> bit<00:01:04.350> later<00:01:04.559> on<00:01:04.650> so

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
get into it a little bit later on so

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.250 
get into it a little bit later on so
first<00:01:05.430> of<00:01:05.549> all<00:01:05.640> let's<00:01:06.210> try<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.479> steps<00:01:07.110> of

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
first of all let's try the steps of

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.350 
first of all let's try the steps of
motion<00:01:07.680> we're<00:01:07.920> gonna<00:01:08.070> step<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.340> one<00:01:08.580> side<00:01:08.610> we

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
motion we're gonna step to one side we

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:17.120 
motion we're gonna step to one side we
get<00:01:09.479> in<00:01:09.630> one<00:01:10.560> side<00:01:10.799> bring<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.369> in<00:01:11.580> 1<00:01:12.420> &amp;<00:01:13.020> 2<00:01:13.880> 1<00:01:14.930> 2<00:01:16.130> 1

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
get in one side bring it in 1 &amp; 2 1 2 1

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.690 
get in one side bring it in 1 &amp; 2 1 2 1
&amp;<00:01:17.700> 2<00:01:18.380> 1<00:01:19.380> &amp;<00:01:19.549> 2<00:01:20.580> yeah<00:01:21.090> ok<00:01:21.780> so<00:01:22.200> this<00:01:22.530> play<00:01:22.890> motion<00:01:23.460> is

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
&amp; 2 1 &amp; 2 yeah ok so this play motion is

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.940 
&amp; 2 1 &amp; 2 yeah ok so this play motion is
set<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.030> motion<00:01:24.210> here<00:01:24.630> now<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.350> best<00:01:25.710> way<00:01:25.920> I

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
set the motion here now the best way I

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:26.790 
set the motion here now the best way I
can

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:26.800 
can

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.380

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
space and you do the movement a little

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:30.300 
space and you do the movement a little
bit<00:02:16.660> quicker<00:02:27.780> okay<00:02:28.780> so<00:02:28.900> notice<00:02:29.200> now<00:02:29.890> I<00:02:29.920> have<00:02:30.190> to

bit quicker okay so notice now I have to

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.880 
bit quicker okay so notice now I have to
swing<00:02:30.580> feeling<00:02:31.030> even<00:02:31.540> though<00:02:31.870> my<00:02:32.410> head<00:02:32.590> is<00:02:32.680> not

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890
