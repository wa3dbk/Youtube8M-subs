that way we play they had so much

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.460 
that way we play they had so much
pressure<00:02:26.550> on<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:26.790> front<00:02:26.970> end<00:02:27.150> with<00:02:27.990> all<00:02:28.350> the

guards pressure and stuff like that so

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.210 
guards pressure and stuff like that so
when<00:02:30.900> we<00:02:31.050> did<00:02:31.230> break<00:02:31.410> the<00:02:31.470> press<00:02:31.770> it<00:02:31.950> was<00:02:31.980> just

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
when we did break the press it was just

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.800 
when we did break the press it was just
easy<00:02:32.430> for<00:02:32.730> us<00:02:32.820> to<00:02:32.850> just<00:02:33.150> make<00:02:33.360> the<00:02:33.510> dump-off

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
easy for us to just make the dump-off

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.450 
easy for us to just make the dump-off
pass<00:02:33.840> and<00:02:34.290> for<00:02:34.470> just<00:02:34.650> for<00:02:34.800> me<00:02:34.890> to<00:02:34.980> finish<00:02:35.160> and

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
pass and for just for me to finish and

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.100 
pass and for just for me to finish and
it<00:02:35.520> was<00:02:35.610> up<00:02:35.730> to<00:02:35.850> me<00:02:35.880> at<00:02:36.360> that<00:02:36.450> point<00:02:36.720> just<00:02:36.960> to

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
it was up to me at that point just to

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.949 
it was up to me at that point just to
make<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:37.980> easy<00:02:38.100> layup<00:02:38.430> or<00:02:38.790> make<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:39.600> dunk<00:02:39.810> or

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
make the easy layup or make the dunk or

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.900 
make the easy layup or make the dunk or
anything<00:02:40.260> like<00:02:40.290> that<00:02:40.440> so<00:02:40.830> I<00:02:40.860> think<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.640> guards

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
anything like that so I think the guards

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.070 
anything like that so I think the guards
is<00:02:41.970> a<00:02:42.030> great<00:02:42.240> job<00:02:42.450> giving<00:02:42.870> me<00:02:42.959> those

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
is a great job giving me those

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.390 
is a great job giving me those
opportunities<00:02:43.760> Charles<00:02:44.760> response<00:02:46.130> runs<00:02:47.130> and

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
opportunities Charles response runs and

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.800

they hands like every time they made
some<00:02:49.020> winners<00:02:49.590> I<00:02:49.950> thought<00:02:50.670> we<00:02:50.790> were<00:02:50.910> able<00:02:51.030> to

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150

experience<00:02:55.770> a<00:02:55.890> lot<00:02:56.010> of<00:02:56.130> guys<00:02:56.250> that<00:02:56.280> are<00:02:56.520> poised

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
experience a lot of guys that are poised

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.550 
experience a lot of guys that are poised
and<00:02:57.120> then<00:02:57.510> we<00:02:57.600> have<00:02:57.690> guys<00:02:57.840> like<00:02:58.050> Devin<00:02:58.380> and

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
and then we have guys like Devin and

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.170 
and then we have guys like Devin and
Evan<00:02:58.830> that<00:02:58.950> come<00:02:59.100> off<00:02:59.130> the<00:02:59.340> bench<00:02:59.490> that<00:03:00.030> are

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
Evan that come off the bench that are

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.850 
Evan that come off the bench that are
also<00:03:00.330> able<00:03:00.570> to<00:03:00.720> help<00:03:00.870> us<00:03:00.990> handle<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.350> ball<00:03:01.500> and

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
also able to help us handle the ball and

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.440 
also able to help us handle the ball and
you<00:03:02.310> know<00:03:02.430> make<00:03:02.610> smart<00:03:02.820> decisions<00:03:02.850> out<00:03:03.300> there

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
you know make smart decisions out there

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.600 
you know make smart decisions out there
you<00:03:04.290> know<00:03:04.410> we<00:03:04.530> we<00:03:04.950> knew<00:03:05.130> if<00:03:05.250> we<00:03:05.310> could<00:03:05.400> break

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
you know we we knew if we could break

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.190 
you know we we knew if we could break
their<00:03:05.820> pressure<00:03:06.060> we<00:03:06.690> could<00:03:06.870> make<00:03:07.020> them

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
their pressure we could make them

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.720 
their pressure we could make them
lighten<00:03:07.590> up<00:03:07.650> a<00:03:07.770> little<00:03:07.920> bit<00:03:08.160> in<00:03:08.310> terms<00:03:08.490> of

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
lighten up a little bit in terms of

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:09.770 
lighten up a little bit in terms of
because<00:03:08.940> we<00:03:09.060> knew<00:03:09.150> they<00:03:09.360> would<00:03:09.480> come<00:03:09.510> out<00:03:09.690> with

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
because we knew they would come out with

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.620 
because we knew they would come out with
a<00:03:09.840> lot<00:03:09.959> of<00:03:10.020> energy<00:03:10.260> but<00:03:11.040> we<00:03:11.160> had<00:03:11.340> to<00:03:11.510> you<00:03:12.510> know

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
a lot of energy but we had to you know

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.509 
a lot of energy but we had to you know
break<00:03:12.840> the<00:03:13.019> pressure<00:03:13.230> and<00:03:13.590> get<00:03:14.070> layups<00:03:14.220> in<00:03:14.400> the

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
break the pressure and get layups in the

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.280 
break the pressure and get layups in the
other<00:03:14.640> and<00:03:14.850> so<00:03:15.000> we<00:03:15.120> could<00:03:15.300> make<00:03:15.810> them<00:03:15.959> back<00:03:16.140> off

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
other and so we could make them back off

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.870 
other and so we could make them back off
a<00:03:16.350> little<00:03:16.620> bit<00:03:16.830> but<00:03:17.160> in<00:03:17.310> the<00:03:17.400> second<00:03:17.640> half<00:03:17.760> they

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
a little bit but in the second half they

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.060 
a little bit but in the second half they
came<00:03:18.090> out<00:03:18.269> spirited<00:03:19.080> made<00:03:19.260> runs<00:03:19.560> got<00:03:19.890> it<00:03:19.980> down

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
came out spirited made runs got it down

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.740 
came out spirited made runs got it down
to<00:03:20.100> four<00:03:20.340> points<00:03:20.640> and<00:03:20.760> we<00:03:20.820> were<00:03:20.940> able<00:03:21.060> to<00:03:21.269> you

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
to four points and we were able to you

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.660 
to four points and we were able to you
know<00:03:21.870> be<00:03:22.050> resilient<00:03:22.410> and<00:03:22.650> push<00:03:22.800> back<00:03:22.980> you<00:03:23.550> know

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
know be resilient and push back you know

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.070 
know be resilient and push back you know
I<00:03:23.700> think<00:03:24.000> playing<00:03:24.360> on<00:03:24.450> the<00:03:24.540> ropers<00:03:24.870> it's<00:03:24.989> a

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
I think playing on the ropers it's a

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.540 
I think playing on the ropers it's a
totally<00:03:25.350> different<00:03:25.380> challenge<00:03:25.980> it<00:03:26.130> it

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
totally different challenge it it

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.850 
totally different challenge it it
presents<00:03:26.730> a<00:03:27.120> and<00:03:27.540> you<00:03:28.200> have<00:03:28.380> to<00:03:28.500> have<00:03:28.590> a<00:03:28.620> new

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
presents a and you have to have a new

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.259 
presents a and you have to have a new
level<00:03:29.100> of<00:03:29.930> execution<00:03:30.930> and<00:03:32.180> communication<00:03:33.180> on

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
level of execution and communication on

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.090 
level of execution and communication on
the<00:03:33.360> road<00:03:33.540> in<00:03:33.900> terms<00:03:34.170> of<00:03:34.260> on<00:03:34.410> the<00:03:34.560> court<00:03:34.800> and<00:03:34.980> I

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
the road in terms of on the court and I

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.650 
the road in terms of on the court and I
thought<00:03:35.250> we<00:03:35.430> we<00:03:35.910> stepped<00:03:36.150> up<00:03:36.269> everything

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
thought we we stepped up everything

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.930 
thought we we stepped up everything
executing<00:03:37.519> communicating<00:03:38.519> on<00:03:38.610> the<00:03:38.700> court

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
executing communicating on the court

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.400 
executing communicating on the court
ball<00:03:39.300> screens<00:03:39.690> transition<00:03:40.260> defense

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
ball screens transition defense

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.220 
ball screens transition defense
rebounding<00:03:41.220> all<00:03:41.400> of<00:03:41.820> that<00:03:41.970> and<00:03:42.660> then

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
rebounding all of that and then

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.600 
rebounding all of that and then
executing<00:03:43.709> our<00:03:43.769> place<00:03:44.010> I<00:03:44.190> thought<00:03:44.370> we<00:03:44.459> did<00:03:44.489> a

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
executing our place I thought we did a

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.910 
executing our place I thought we did a
very<00:03:44.790> good<00:03:44.910> job<00:03:45.060> and<00:03:45.570> making<00:03:46.530> the<00:03:46.650> extra<00:03:46.709> pass

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
very good job and making the extra pass

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.949 
very good job and making the extra pass
and<00:03:47.070> being<00:03:47.370> patient<00:03:47.519> in<00:03:47.850> this<00:03:48.450> environment<00:03:48.720> I

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
and being patient in this environment I

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.890 
and being patient in this environment I
think<00:03:49.140> that's<00:03:49.260> what<00:03:49.410> you<00:03:49.440> need<00:03:49.650> to<00:03:49.680> do
