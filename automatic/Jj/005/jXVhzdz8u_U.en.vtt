interested do stick around hi guys so
first<00:00:19.420> and<00:00:19.570> foremost<00:00:19.660> um<00:00:20.470> with<00:00:21.310> foundations<00:00:22.120> I

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:22.450 
first and foremost um with foundations I

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.470 
first and foremost um with foundations I
don't<00:00:22.930> really<00:00:23.350> have<00:00:23.530> fixed<00:00:24.310> pairings<00:00:24.910> that<00:00:25.180> I

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:25.480 
don't really have fixed pairings that I

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.560 
don't really have fixed pairings that I
do<00:00:25.600> all<00:00:26.170> the<00:00:26.770> time<00:00:26.980> but<00:00:27.280> there<00:00:27.910> are<00:00:28.150> two

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:28.570 
do all the time but there are two

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.700 
do all the time but there are two
combinations<00:00:29.320> that<00:00:30.390> really<00:00:31.390> I've<00:00:31.690> done<00:00:32.410> more

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:32.710 
combinations that really I've done more

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.940 
combinations that really I've done more
than<00:00:33.070> others<00:00:34.230> essentially<00:00:35.230> there's<00:00:35.440> just<00:00:35.710> one

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:35.950 
than others essentially there's just one

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.640 
than others essentially there's just one
basic<00:00:36.579> um<00:00:36.820> I<00:00:37.390> guess<00:00:38.230> you<00:00:38.350> could<00:00:38.380> say

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:38.650 
basic um I guess you could say

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.819 
basic um I guess you could say
philosophy<00:00:39.310> for<00:00:39.460> me<00:00:39.640> when<00:00:39.790> it<00:00:39.910> comes<00:00:40.120> to

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
philosophy for me when it comes to

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.990 
philosophy for me when it comes to
combining<00:00:41.829> pairing<00:00:42.520> or<00:00:42.700> layering

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.000 
combining pairing or layering

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.870 
combining pairing or layering
foundations<00:00:43.930> and<00:00:44.260> it<00:00:44.770> boils<00:00:45.220> down<00:00:45.489> to<00:00:45.610> two

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:45.880 
foundations and it boils down to two

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.319 
foundations and it boils down to two
things<00:00:45.910> one<00:00:46.690> is<00:00:46.720> um<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:48.190> texture<00:00:48.820> of<00:00:48.850> both

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329 
things one is um the texture of both

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:55.910 
things one is um the texture of both
foundations<00:00:50.170> and<00:00:51.809> second<00:00:52.809> is<00:00:53.200> I<00:00:53.950> guess<00:00:54.700> the

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
foundations and second is I guess the

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.880 
foundations and second is I guess the
texture<00:00:56.920> or<00:00:57.100> the<00:00:57.219> state<00:00:57.460> of<00:00:57.489> my<00:00:57.820> skin<00:00:58.239> on<00:00:58.570> a

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
texture or the state of my skin on a

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.970 
texture or the state of my skin on a
given<00:00:59.890> daily<00:01:00.370> basis<00:01:01.059> so<00:01:01.899> depending<00:01:02.590> on<00:01:02.710> those

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:02.980 
given daily basis so depending on those

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.130 
given daily basis so depending on those
the<00:01:03.280> combination<00:01:04.000> is<00:01:04.030> really<00:01:04.390> very<00:01:04.600> for<00:01:05.110> me

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
the combination is really very for me

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.239 
the combination is really very for me
but<00:01:06.100> essentially<00:01:07.060> I<00:01:07.090> always<00:01:07.920> do<00:01:08.920> try<00:01:09.219> to

00:01:09.239 --> 00:01:09.249 
but essentially I always do try to

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:11.459 
but essentially I always do try to
anchor<00:01:09.549> any<00:01:10.119> foundation<00:01:10.840> layering<00:01:11.079> or

00:01:11.459 --> 00:01:11.469 
anchor any foundation layering or

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:15.419 
anchor any foundation layering or
combinations<00:01:12.249> with<00:01:12.549> um<00:01:13.060> a<00:01:13.899> better<00:01:14.649> brand<00:01:15.039> I

00:01:15.419 --> 00:01:15.429 
combinations with um a better brand I

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:18.050 
combinations with um a better brand I
should<00:01:15.700> say<00:01:15.850> or<00:01:16.030> I<00:01:16.299> guess<00:01:17.079> higher<00:01:17.560> and<00:01:17.920> more

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
should say or I guess higher and more

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.429 
should say or I guess higher and more
quality<00:01:19.060> um<00:01:20.520> driven<00:01:21.520> bread<00:01:21.850> versus<00:01:22.810> just<00:01:23.139> you

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:23.439 
quality um driven bread versus just you

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:29.879 
quality um driven bread versus just you
know<00:01:23.590> um<00:01:25.979> drugstore<00:01:26.979> price<00:01:27.279> brands<00:01:28.889> only

00:01:29.879 --> 00:01:29.889 
know um drugstore price brands only

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:31.559 
know um drugstore price brands only
because<00:01:30.069> I<00:01:30.310> think<00:01:30.520> really<00:01:30.880> when<00:01:31.060> it<00:01:31.149> comes<00:01:31.179> to

00:01:31.559 --> 00:01:31.569 
because I think really when it comes to

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:34.349 
because I think really when it comes to
skin<00:01:31.840> care<00:01:32.170> or<00:01:32.409> foundations<00:01:33.249> you<00:01:33.849> really<00:01:34.179> can

00:01:34.349 --> 00:01:34.359 
skin care or foundations you really can

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:36.389 
skin care or foundations you really can
see<00:01:34.659> a<00:01:34.689> very<00:01:35.020> striking<00:01:35.349> difference<00:01:35.950> between

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:36.399 
see a very striking difference between

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:39.120 
see a very striking difference between
quality<00:01:37.560> mainly<00:01:38.560> because<00:01:38.740> of<00:01:38.920> the

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
quality mainly because of the

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.649 
quality mainly because of the
ingredients<00:01:39.369> that<00:01:39.789> they're<00:01:39.939> made<00:01:40.149> of<00:01:40.359> so<00:01:40.630> i

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
ingredients that they're made of so i

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.609 
ingredients that they're made of so i
feel<00:01:41.079> i<00:01:41.349> feel<00:01:42.189> that<00:01:42.520> just<00:01:43.029> by<00:01:43.209> having<00:01:43.479> a<00:01:43.840> better

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
feel i feel that just by having a better

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:46.830 
feel i feel that just by having a better
quality<00:01:44.950> as<00:01:45.490> your<00:01:45.729> first<00:01:45.909> layer<00:01:46.240> it<00:01:46.539> really

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
quality as your first layer it really

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.989 
quality as your first layer it really
just<00:01:47.020> anchors<00:01:47.679> anything<00:01:47.919> else<00:01:48.459> you<00:01:48.669> put<00:01:48.819> on

00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:48.999 
just anchors anything else you put on

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:51.899 
just anchors anything else you put on
top<00:01:49.209> so<00:01:49.630> mostly<00:01:50.619> most<00:01:50.919> of<00:01:51.009> the<00:01:51.099> combinations<00:01:51.759> i

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
top so mostly most of the combinations i

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.819 
top so mostly most of the combinations i
make<00:01:52.240> our<00:01:53.039> of<00:01:54.039> the<00:01:54.909> kind<00:01:55.240> where<00:01:55.689> i<00:01:55.990> mix<00:01:56.529> higher

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:56.829 
make our of the kind where i mix higher

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:00.559 
make our of the kind where i mix higher
end<00:01:57.159> with<00:01:57.700> you<00:01:58.539> know<00:01:58.659> lower<00:01:58.990> price

00:02:00.559 --> 00:02:00.569 
end with you know lower price

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:04.620 
end with you know lower price
foundations<00:02:01.569> just<00:02:02.409> to<00:02:02.499> achieve<00:02:02.919> um<00:02:03.450> just<00:02:04.450> a

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
foundations just to achieve um just a

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.639 
foundations just to achieve um just a
better<00:02:04.899> a<00:02:05.349> more<00:02:06.069> unique<00:02:06.489> or<00:02:06.880> you<00:02:07.389> know

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
better a more unique or you know

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.600 
better a more unique or you know
customized<00:02:08.649> finish

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
customized finish

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.630 
customized finish
so<00:02:10.000> I<00:02:10.360> guess<00:02:11.200> that's<00:02:11.560> about<00:02:11.710> it<00:02:11.860> I'm<00:02:12.130> gonna<00:02:12.340> get

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
so I guess that's about it I'm gonna get

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.720 
so I guess that's about it I'm gonna get
on<00:02:12.820> with<00:02:13.570> it<00:02:13.600> right<00:02:14.050> away<00:02:14.110> and<00:02:14.500> this<00:02:15.430> first

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
on with it right away and this first

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.510 
on with it right away and this first
pairing<00:02:16.210> is<00:02:17.110> the<00:02:17.350> first<00:02:17.650> combination<00:02:18.040> i've

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
pairing is the first combination i've

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.690 
pairing is the first combination i've
ever<00:02:18.730> done<00:02:19.090> with<00:02:19.360> foundations<00:02:20.050> and<00:02:20.700> what

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
ever done with foundations and what

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.550 
ever done with foundations and what
drove<00:02:21.910> me<00:02:21.970> to<00:02:22.120> kind<00:02:22.480> of<00:02:22.600> just<00:02:22.840> start<00:02:23.200> pairing

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
drove me to kind of just start pairing

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.860 
drove me to kind of just start pairing
them<00:02:23.740> together<00:02:23.920> was<00:02:24.490> I<00:02:24.730> actually<00:02:25.330> honestly

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
them together was I actually honestly

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.610 
them together was I actually honestly
wanted<00:02:26.560> to<00:02:26.680> be<00:02:26.830> more<00:02:28.020> cost-conscious<00:02:29.020> and

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
wanted to be more cost-conscious and

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.070 
wanted to be more cost-conscious and
since<00:02:30.400> in<00:02:30.550> Canada<00:02:31.000> we<00:02:31.030> get<00:02:31.300> everything<00:02:31.660> so

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
since in Canada we get everything so

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.460 
since in Canada we get everything so
much<00:02:32.230> more<00:02:32.290> expensive<00:02:32.950> a<00:02:34.440> foundation<00:02:35.440> that

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
much more expensive a foundation that

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.400 
much more expensive a foundation that
would<00:02:35.770> cost<00:02:36.360> forty<00:02:37.360> dollars<00:02:37.750> in<00:02:37.959> the<00:02:37.990> states

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
would cost forty dollars in the states

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.070 
would cost forty dollars in the states
would<00:02:38.680> be<00:02:38.860> 50<00:02:39.280> Canadian<00:02:39.850> and<00:02:40.180> that's<00:02:40.840> without

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
would be 50 Canadian and that's without

taxes and in Vancouver or taxes run i

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.370 
taxes and in Vancouver or taxes run i
believe<00:02:46.600> about<00:02:47.880> fourteen<00:02:48.880> percent<00:02:49.120> so<00:02:49.959> it's

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
believe about fourteen percent so it's

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.650 
believe about fourteen percent so it's
quite<00:02:50.620> steep<00:02:51.010> I<00:02:51.160> don't<00:02:51.910> think<00:02:52.150> you<00:02:52.270> could<00:02:52.480> get

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
quite steep I don't think you could get

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:59.960 
quite steep I don't think you could get

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
forty-five or fifty dollars even so

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.130 
forty-five or fifty dollars even so
because<00:03:05.170> of<00:03:05.200> those<00:03:05.500> reasons<00:03:05.709> I<00:03:06.430> just<00:03:06.850> thought

but<00:04:16.019> I<00:04:16.260> swear<00:04:16.949> by<00:04:16.980> the<00:04:17.160> silk<00:04:17.489> creme<00:04:17.820> foundation

but I swear by the silk creme foundation

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:22.370 
but I swear by the silk creme foundation
I'm<00:04:19.109> not<00:04:19.769> too<00:04:19.949> sure<00:04:20.130> exactly<00:04:20.549> why<00:04:20.820> but<00:04:21.109> it<00:04:22.109> says

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
I'm not too sure exactly why but it says

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.760 
I'm not too sure exactly why but it says
it<00:04:22.530> is<00:04:22.680> luminous<00:04:23.160> coverage<00:04:23.639> I<00:04:23.940> just<00:04:24.770> prefer

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
it is luminous coverage I just prefer

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.850 
it is luminous coverage I just prefer
the<00:04:26.490> finish<00:04:26.940> or<00:04:27.150> I<00:04:27.540> don't<00:04:28.110> know<00:04:28.260> if<00:04:28.410> it<00:04:28.710> has

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
the finish or I don't know if it has

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.800 
the finish or I don't know if it has
more<00:04:29.040> coverage<00:04:29.430> I<00:04:29.550> guess<00:04:30.150> it<00:04:30.300> does<00:04:30.449> because

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
more coverage I guess it does because

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.530 
more coverage I guess it does because
this<00:04:30.990> is<00:04:31.169> a<00:04:31.199> foundation<00:04:31.860> versus<00:04:32.639> tinted

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 
this is a foundation versus tinted

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.540 
this is a foundation versus tinted
moisturizer<00:04:34.110> so<00:04:34.470> I<00:04:34.500> think<00:04:34.830> that's<00:04:35.310> why<00:04:35.520> I

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
moisturizer so I think that's why I

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.080 
moisturizer so I think that's why I
prefer<00:04:35.940> it<00:04:36.300> more<00:04:36.600> um<00:04:36.870> and<00:04:37.639> the<00:04:38.639> reason<00:04:38.910> why<00:04:39.060> I

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
prefer it more um and the reason why I

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.450 
prefer it more um and the reason why I
decided<00:04:39.449> to<00:04:39.780> pair<00:04:40.350> this<00:04:40.590> together<00:04:40.830> or<00:04:41.190> give<00:04:41.310> it

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
decided to pair this together or give it

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.820 
decided to pair this together or give it
a<00:04:41.490> shot<00:04:41.729> actually<00:04:42.300> was<00:04:42.479> that<00:04:42.720> this<00:04:43.440> is<00:04:43.650> very

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
a shot actually was that this is very

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.650 
a shot actually was that this is very
pricey<00:04:44.190> this<00:04:44.550> cost<00:04:44.850> like<00:04:45.030> fifty<00:04:46.400> Canadian

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.730 
to experiment and try because I did like
this<00:04:58.139> a<00:04:58.200> lot<00:04:58.320> and<00:04:58.790> the<00:04:59.790> consistency<00:05:00.540> of<00:05:01.260> this

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
this a lot and the consistency of this

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:06.350 
this a lot and the consistency of this
booth<00:05:02.100> number<00:05:02.280> seven<00:05:02.820> is<00:05:03.979> much<00:05:04.979> more<00:05:05.370> liquid

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
booth number seven is much more liquid

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.860 
booth number seven is much more liquid
like<00:05:06.570> and<00:05:06.870> I'm<00:05:07.260> gonna<00:05:07.440> try<00:05:07.830> to<00:05:07.889> show<00:05:08.220> you<00:05:08.280> guys

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 
like and I'm gonna try to show you guys

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:13.730 
like and I'm gonna try to show you guys
so<00:05:09.870> that's<00:05:11.510> so<00:05:12.510> that's<00:05:12.539> how<00:05:12.810> it<00:05:12.960> looks<00:05:13.229> and<00:05:13.500> it

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
so that's so that's how it looks and it

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.080 
so that's so that's how it looks and it
doesn't<00:05:14.100> really<00:05:14.430> run<00:05:15.050> but<00:05:16.050> it's<00:05:16.470> still<00:05:16.860> less<00:05:17.610> I

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
doesn't really run but it's still less I

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.580 
doesn't really run but it's still less I
mean<00:05:18.449> it's<00:05:18.600> it's<00:05:19.289> still<00:05:19.740> more<00:05:20.400> liquid<00:05:20.880> than

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:21.590 
mean it's it's still more liquid than

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.490 
mean it's it's still more liquid than
the<00:05:22.590> laura<00:05:23.340> mercier<00:05:23.760> if<00:05:24.090> I<00:05:24.270> hold<00:05:24.960> this<00:05:25.200> up<00:05:25.410> a

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 
the laura mercier if I hold this up a

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.260 
the laura mercier if I hold this up a
bit<00:05:25.530> longer<00:05:25.979> it's<00:05:26.340> going<00:05:26.520> to<00:05:26.610> start<00:05:26.820> running

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.270 
bit longer it's going to start running

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.560 
bit longer it's going to start running
and<00:05:27.740> it<00:05:28.740> kind<00:05:29.280> of<00:05:29.400> is<00:05:29.700> already<00:05:30.030> beginning<00:05:30.360> to

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:30.570 
and it kind of is already beginning to

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.750 
and it kind of is already beginning to
kind<00:05:30.930> of<00:05:31.050> you<00:05:31.440> know<00:05:31.470> have<00:05:31.889> a<00:05:31.919> weight<00:05:32.250> and<00:05:32.460> run

see that it's already beginning to run
down<00:06:02.400> my<00:06:02.570> run<00:06:03.570> down<00:06:03.750> my<00:06:03.780> hand<00:06:04.289> and<00:06:04.770> this<00:06:05.729> one

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:06.030 
down my run down my hand and this one

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:08.120 
down my run down my hand and this one
not<00:06:06.479> so<00:06:06.539> much<00:06:06.840> you<00:06:07.229> could<00:06:07.380> see<00:06:07.560> how<00:06:07.680> thick<00:06:07.979> the

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:08.130 
not so much you could see how thick the

not so much you could see how thick the
laura<00:06:08.400> mercier<00:06:08.880> is<00:06:09.210> and<00:06:09.510> this<00:06:09.690> is<00:06:09.750> the<00:06:09.960> booth

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:10.139 
laura mercier is and this is the booth

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:12.890 
laura mercier is and this is the booth
number<00:06:10.289> seven<00:06:10.770> so<00:06:10.950> i<00:06:11.510> thought<00:06:12.510> of<00:06:12.720> just

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:12.900 
number seven so i thought of just

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.680 
number seven so i thought of just
possibly<00:06:13.590> combining<00:06:14.280> them<00:06:14.460> at<00:06:14.669> first<00:06:14.940> because

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:15.690 
possibly combining them at first because

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:19.909 
possibly combining them at first because
um<00:06:16.169> it<00:06:16.560> will<00:06:17.340> make<00:06:17.789> the<00:06:18.510> my<00:06:19.289> laura<00:06:19.560> mercier

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:19.919 
um it will make the my laura mercier

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:21.940 
um it will make the my laura mercier
last<00:06:20.370> so<00:06:20.520> much<00:06:20.639> longer<00:06:20.700> and

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:21.950 
last so much longer and

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:24.010 
last so much longer and
and<00:06:22.070> actually<00:06:22.460> not<00:06:23.090> only<00:06:23.120> did<00:06:23.600> that<00:06:23.780> it

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:24.020 
and actually not only did that it

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.310 
and actually not only did that it
actually<00:06:24.200> created<00:06:24.980> such<00:06:25.310> a<00:06:25.340> great<00:06:25.700> finish<00:06:26.320> I

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:27.320 
actually created such a great finish I

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.910 
actually created such a great finish I
felt<00:06:27.950> like<00:06:28.100> it<00:06:28.900> muted<00:06:29.900> out<00:06:30.050> the<00:06:30.320> coverage<00:06:30.710> of

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:30.920 
felt like it muted out the coverage of

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.830 
felt like it muted out the coverage of
the<00:06:31.130> Laura<00:06:31.340> Mercier's<00:06:31.730> very<00:06:32.150> full<00:06:32.450> coverage

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:32.840 
the Laura Mercier's very full coverage

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.230 
the Laura Mercier's very full coverage
and<00:06:33.140> somehow<00:06:33.350> they<00:06:33.650> looting<00:06:34.100> it<00:06:34.220> a<00:06:34.310> bit<00:06:34.550> with

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:35.240 
and somehow they looting it a bit with

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.930 
and somehow they looting it a bit with
the<00:06:35.390> lifting<00:06:35.750> and<00:06:35.840> firming<00:06:35.930> of<00:06:36.500> boots<00:06:36.940> just

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:37.940 
the lifting and firming of boots just

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:40.960 
the lifting and firming of boots just
gave<00:06:38.540> it<00:06:38.780> a<00:06:38.930> more<00:06:39.200> sheer<00:06:40.130> doubt<00:06:40.460> luminous

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:40.970 
gave it a more sheer doubt luminous

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:42.730 
gave it a more sheer doubt luminous
effect<00:06:41.360> and<00:06:41.630> since<00:06:41.870> I<00:06:41.990> don't<00:06:42.050> really<00:06:42.620> need

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:42.740 
effect and since I don't really need

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.410 
effect and since I don't really need
that<00:06:42.800> much<00:06:43.100> coverage<00:06:43.550> it<00:06:43.730> just<00:06:43.940> work<00:06:44.180> out

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:44.420 
that much coverage it just work out

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:48.340 
that much coverage it just work out
really<00:06:44.720> really<00:06:44.870> well<00:06:45.370> so<00:06:46.780> this<00:06:47.780> is<00:06:47.930> a<00:06:47.960> bit<00:06:48.200> too

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:48.350 
really really well so this is a bit too

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:49.990 
really really well so this is a bit too
much<00:06:48.500> for<00:06:48.560> my<00:06:48.830> entire<00:06:49.040> face<00:06:49.400> but<00:06:49.640> what<00:06:49.760> I<00:06:49.790> would

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:50.000 
much for my entire face but what I would

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.110 
much for my entire face but what I would
usually<00:06:50.150> do<00:06:50.540> is<00:06:50.690> just<00:06:50.900> kind<00:06:51.680> of<00:06:51.830> get<00:06:52.610> a<00:06:52.640> pump<00:06:52.970> of

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:53.120 
usually do is just kind of get a pump of

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.920 
usually do is just kind of get a pump of
each<00:06:53.450> and<00:06:53.690> just<00:06:53.990> kind<00:06:54.200> of<00:06:55.150> use<00:06:56.150> my<00:06:56.390> the<00:06:56.450> back<00:06:56.780> of

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:56.930 
each and just kind of use my the back of

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:59.650 
each and just kind of use my the back of
my<00:06:57.080> hand<00:06:57.290> as<00:06:57.410> a<00:06:57.440> palette<00:06:57.980> and<00:06:58.240> you<00:06:59.240> know<00:06:59.360> just
