doesn't<00:01:43.640> sound<00:01:43.820> like<00:01:44.120> a<00:01:44.150> lot<00:01:44.540> of<00:01:44.600> fun<00:01:44.900> because

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.260 
doesn't sound like a lot of fun because

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.620 
doesn't sound like a lot of fun because
some<00:01:45.500> of<00:01:45.530> those<00:01:45.740> are<00:01:46.040> very<00:01:46.670> difficult<00:01:47.330> to<00:01:47.450> get

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
some of those are very difficult to get

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.170 
some of those are very difficult to get
so<00:01:48.080> the<00:01:48.470> fact<00:01:48.680> that<00:01:48.800> we<00:01:48.950> get<00:01:49.100> to<00:01:49.190> share<00:01:49.460> most<00:01:49.909> of

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
so the fact that we get to share most of

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.190 
so the fact that we get to share most of
them<00:01:50.800> account-wide<00:01:51.800> is<00:01:52.510> awesome<00:01:53.510> really<00:01:54.020> look

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
forward to that in fact I might just go

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.800 
forward to that in fact I might just go
back<00:01:56.990> into<00:01:58.300> farming<00:01:59.300> those<00:01:59.420> achievements

saves a lot of time when you're leveling
right<00:02:20.450> there<00:02:20.690> instances<00:02:21.110> and<00:02:21.680> you're<00:02:21.860> farming

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
right there instances and you're farming

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.490 
right there instances and you're farming
some<00:02:22.580> things<00:02:22.850> whatever<00:02:23.720> it's<00:02:24.170> just<00:02:24.350> going<00:02:24.440> to

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
some things whatever it's just going to

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.610 
some things whatever it's just going to
make<00:02:24.560> things<00:02:24.680> so<00:02:25.580> much<00:02:25.610> more<00:02:26.440> efficient<00:02:27.440> and

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
make things so much more efficient and

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.750 
make things so much more efficient and
quick<00:02:28.489> 10<00:02:29.330> great<00:02:29.630> so<00:02:30.290> that's<00:02:31.190> awesome<00:02:31.430> that's

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
quick 10 great so that's awesome that's

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.759 
quick 10 great so that's awesome that's
around<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:32.209> corn<00:02:32.420> as<00:02:32.570> well<00:02:32.750> there's<00:02:33.590> also

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
around the corn as well there's also

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:37.270 
around the corn as well there's also
going<00:02:34.040> to<00:02:34.100> be<00:02:34.160> a<00:02:34.580> world<00:02:35.330> event<00:02:35.480> so<00:02:36.440> this<00:02:36.950> one

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
going to be a world event so this one

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.940 
going to be a world event so this one
usually<00:02:37.790> there's<00:02:38.090> a<00:02:38.150> little<00:02:38.450> bit<00:02:38.630> when<00:02:39.140> they

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
usually there's a little bit when they

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.800 
usually there's a little bit when they
have<00:02:40.459> the<00:02:40.610> patch<00:02:40.790> that<00:02:41.000> transitions<00:02:41.570> from

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
have the patch that transitions from

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.949 
have the patch that transitions from
between<00:02:42.620> expansions<00:02:43.280> so<00:02:44.120> of<00:02:44.540> course<00:02:44.750> you're

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
between expansions so of course you're

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:46.210 
between expansions so of course you're
going<00:02:45.110> to<00:02:45.170> have<00:02:45.290> another<00:02:45.530> world<00:02:45.769> so<00:02:46.010> this

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
going to have another world so this

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.789 
going to have another world so this
whole<00:02:46.370> event<00:02:46.519> is<00:02:46.820> about<00:02:47.030> garage<00:02:47.799> attacking

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:48.799 
whole event is about garage attacking

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:53.520 
whole event is about garage attacking
Dana<00:02:49.070> is<00:02:49.280> home<00:02:49.700> island<00:02:50.299> of<00:02:50.860> their<00:02:51.860> amor<00:02:52.310> which

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
Dana is home island of their amor which

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.960 
Dana is home island of their amor which
they're<00:02:54.530> nowhere<00:02:54.709> only<00:02:55.130> visited<00:02:55.579> that<00:02:55.760> much

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
they're nowhere only visited that much

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.550 
they're nowhere only visited that much
so<00:02:56.209> will<00:02:56.329> be<00:02:56.450> actually<00:02:56.630> pretty<00:02:56.930> cool<00:02:57.140> to<00:02:57.350> kind

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
so will be actually pretty cool to kind

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.990 
so will be actually pretty cool to kind
of<00:02:57.590> go<00:02:57.739> there<00:02:58.010> cuz<00:02:58.190> that's<00:02:58.340> kind<00:02:58.640> of<00:02:58.700> one<00:02:58.970> of

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
of go there cuz that's kind of one of

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.770 
of go there cuz that's kind of one of
the<00:02:59.920> well<00:03:00.920> I<00:03:01.160> see<00:03:01.459> I<00:03:01.489> haven't<00:03:01.760> done<00:03:02.060> any<00:03:02.450> of<00:03:02.630> the

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
the well I see I haven't done any of the

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.000 
the well I see I haven't done any of the
a<00:03:03.260> lot<00:03:04.160> of<00:03:04.340> the<00:03:04.489> new<00:03:04.640> like<00:03:05.000> old<00:03:05.360> world<00:03:06.010> questing

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
a lot of the new like old world questing

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.970 
a lot of the new like old world questing
so<00:03:07.790> it<00:03:08.600> could<00:03:08.780> be<00:03:08.870> different<00:03:09.049> now<00:03:09.320> but<00:03:09.739> at

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
so it could be different now but at

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:15.970 
so it could be different now but at
least<00:03:10.239> before<00:03:11.239> cataclysm<00:03:13.239> Theramore<00:03:14.239> and<00:03:14.980> the

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
least before cataclysm Theramore and the

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.940 
least before cataclysm Theramore and the
whole<00:03:16.100> area<00:03:16.280> just<00:03:16.549> wasn't<00:03:17.150> like<00:03:17.540> i<00:03:17.930> think<00:03:18.860> i

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
whole area just wasn't like i think i

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.449 
whole area just wasn't like i think i
used<00:03:19.130> to<00:03:19.220> go<00:03:19.370> there<00:03:19.400> to<00:03:20.030> you<00:03:20.989> know<00:03:21.459> travel

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
used to go there to you know travel

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.339 
used to go there to you know travel
between

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:24.349 
between

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:26.360 
between
anyways<00:03:25.349> I'll<00:03:25.530> be<00:03:25.650> looking<00:03:25.950> forward<00:03:26.190> to

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
anyways I'll be looking forward to

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.009 
anyways I'll be looking forward to
hearing<00:03:26.489> more<00:03:26.640> information<00:03:27.360> about<00:03:27.510> the<00:03:27.840> role

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
hearing more information about the role

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:32.330 
hearing more information about the role
event<00:03:29.150> as<00:03:30.150> it<00:03:30.510> gets<00:03:31.440> closer<00:03:31.680> that<00:03:31.980> although<00:03:32.310> I

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
event as it gets closer that although I

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.550 
event as it gets closer that although I
probably<00:03:32.730> could<00:03:33.090> go<00:03:33.269> on<00:03:33.420> the<00:03:33.540> PTR<00:03:33.900> realm<00:03:34.319> which

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
probably could go on the PTR realm which

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.470 
probably could go on the PTR realm which
I<00:03:34.680> never<00:03:34.739> do<00:03:35.129> I<00:03:35.159> never<00:03:35.549> go<00:03:35.730> on<00:03:35.760> the<00:03:36.000> public<00:03:36.299> test

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
I never do I never go on the public test

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.539 
I never do I never go on the public test
and<00:03:36.659> also<00:03:36.959> they're<00:03:37.290> going<00:03:37.590> to<00:03:37.769> be<00:03:38.040> avoiding<00:03:38.489> a

you're going to get the Guardian tree so

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:47.390 
you're going to get the Guardian tree so
be<00:03:46.230> kind<00:03:46.349> of<00:03:46.470> neat<00:03:46.620> to<00:03:46.650> kind<00:03:46.799> of<00:03:47.099> mess<00:03:47.220> around
