good and looking forward to it I end up

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.540 
good and looking forward to it I end up
starting<00:01:50.900> at<00:01:51.230> the<00:01:51.350> back<00:01:51.530> so<00:01:51.980> this<00:01:52.190> year<00:01:52.370> I<00:01:52.400> was

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550 
starting at the back so this year I was

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.580 
starting at the back so this year I was
excited<00:01:52.940> to<00:01:53.030> see<00:01:53.090> that<00:01:53.240> was<00:01:53.540> 45th<00:01:54.140> which<00:01:54.440> is

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
excited to see that was 45th which is

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.730 
excited to see that was 45th which is
like<00:01:54.820> sixth<00:01:55.820> row<00:01:56.000> which<00:01:56.180> isn't<00:01:56.360> good<00:01:56.630> but<00:01:56.870> so<00:01:57.680> I

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
like sixth row which isn't good but so I

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.470 
like sixth row which isn't good but so I
rolled<00:01:57.980> up<00:01:58.160> and<00:01:58.310> then<00:01:58.430> I<00:01:58.460> looked<00:01:58.970> back<00:01:59.150> and<00:01:59.390> I

00:01:59.470 --> 00:01:59.480 
rolled up and then I looked back and I

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.330 
rolled up and then I looked back and I
was<00:01:59.600> still<00:01:59.810> somehow<00:02:00.140> that<00:02:00.800> last<00:02:01.070> of<00:02:01.250> us

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
was still somehow that last of us

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.740 
was still somehow that last of us
there's<00:02:01.610> like<00:02:01.790> the<00:02:01.910> row<00:02:02.090> of<00:02:02.120> people<00:02:02.450> behind<00:02:02.630> me

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
there's like the row of people behind me

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.140 
there's like the row of people behind me
so<00:02:03.650> actually<00:02:04.520> I<00:02:04.550> moved<00:02:04.760> up<00:02:04.850> pretty<00:02:05.060> good

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
so actually I moved up pretty good

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.910 
so actually I moved up pretty good
because<00:02:05.450> there<00:02:05.600> was<00:02:05.690> some<00:02:05.810> European<00:02:06.320> little

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
because there was some European little

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.040 
because there was some European little
midget<00:02:07.250> dude<00:02:07.400> that<00:02:07.670> blew<00:02:08.000> past<00:02:08.240> everybody<00:02:08.600> and

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
midget dude that blew past everybody and

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.610 
midget dude that blew past everybody and
I<00:02:09.610> really<00:02:10.610> sold<00:02:10.940> my<00:02:11.510> soul<00:02:11.780> to<00:02:12.050> keep<00:02:12.080> with<00:02:12.470> him

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
I really sold my soul to keep with him

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.050 
I really sold my soul to keep with him
for<00:02:12.860> just<00:02:12.980> a<00:02:13.130> minute<00:02:13.400> we<00:02:13.550> have<00:02:13.640> passed<00:02:13.820> a<00:02:13.940> lot

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
for just a minute we have passed a lot

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:27.330 
for just a minute we have passed a lot
of<00:02:14.120> guys

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.110 

through<00:02:28.000> here<00:02:28.150> at<00:02:28.330> cross<00:02:28.569> Vegas<00:02:29.130> getting<00:02:30.130> the

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
through here at cross Vegas getting the

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.540 
through here at cross Vegas getting the
soft<00:02:31.420> opening<00:02:31.840> of<00:02:32.050> our<00:02:32.200> new<00:02:32.500> tcx<00:02:32.980> advanced

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
soft opening of our new tcx advanced

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.100 
soft opening of our new tcx advanced
cross<00:02:33.940> bikes<00:02:34.209> which<00:02:34.599> I'm<00:02:34.750> pretty<00:02:34.930> pumped

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
cross bikes which I'm pretty pumped

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.620 
cross bikes which I'm pretty pumped
about<00:02:35.790> mostly<00:02:36.790> because<00:02:36.970> they<00:02:37.239> have<00:02:37.390> real

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
about mostly because they have real

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:38.430 
about mostly because they have real
brakes

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
brakes

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.250 
brakes
they've<00:02:38.950> got<00:02:39.130> disc<00:02:39.310> brakes<00:02:39.580> and<00:02:39.959> SRAM<00:02:40.959> is<00:02:40.989> been

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
they've got disc brakes and SRAM is been

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.680 
they've got disc brakes and SRAM is been
clever<00:02:41.500> enough<00:02:41.590> to<00:02:41.830> actually<00:02:42.069> put<00:02:42.400> together

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
clever enough to actually put together

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.809 
clever enough to actually put together
the<00:02:43.690> red<00:02:44.140> hydro<00:02:44.620> disc<00:02:44.920> systems<00:02:45.370> we<00:02:45.580> actually

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
the red hydro disc systems we actually

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:47.190 
the red hydro disc systems we actually
have<00:02:45.910> a<00:02:45.940> hydraulic<00:02:46.239> disc<00:02:46.540> brake<00:02:46.720> which<00:02:46.930> means

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
have a hydraulic disc brake which means

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.199 
have a hydraulic disc brake which means
you<00:02:47.440> have<00:02:47.620> amazing<00:02:48.340> a<00:02:48.459> feel<00:02:48.670> of<00:02:48.819> modulation

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
you have amazing a feel of modulation

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.750 
you have amazing a feel of modulation
for<00:02:49.690> hopefully<00:02:50.560> coming<00:02:50.890> in<00:02:50.980> a<00:02:51.010> little<00:02:51.280> bit<00:02:51.459> too

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
for hopefully coming in a little bit too

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.339 
for hopefully coming in a little bit too
deep<00:02:51.940> to<00:02:52.239> these<00:02:52.360> last<00:02:52.599> couple<00:02:52.810> turns<00:02:53.110> before

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:53.349 
deep to these last couple turns before

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:56.070 
deep to these last couple turns before
the<00:02:53.530> finish<00:02:53.739> line<00:02:53.769> and<00:02:54.280> then<00:02:54.489> winning<00:02:55.180> we're

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
the finish line and then winning we're

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.020 
the finish line and then winning we're
on<00:02:56.140> a<00:02:56.170> new<00:02:56.440> wheel<00:02:56.950> and<00:02:57.130> tire<00:02:57.310> package<00:02:57.340> this
