00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:08.180
 handbook of violations 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.040
 road traffic 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.530
 the publication is edited by 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.330
 giandomenico protospataro which presents 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.760
 work in its features e 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.490
 general settings this product 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.380
 that you honored me to use for 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.660
 your daily activity and as if 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.699
 a piece of me was somehow in 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.590
 every moment close to you and for me 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:29.600
 this is a great honor for how much 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.100
 regards the characteristics of the 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.830
 I only ask you for some publication 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.260
 instant to be able to explain to you how 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:38.660
 we thought of building this 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.890
 product with a new graphic design that 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.239
 somehow it has also been facilitated 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.690
 from the many observations that 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:49.790
 you do it every day for 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.730
 improve the usability of the product e 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.730
 the publication plan remains 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:57.710
 articulated according to the previous system 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.570
 however, sections are introduced 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.930
 very distinct from each other 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:05.720
 seven numbered sections through use 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:08.600
 of an alphabetical letter starting 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.030
 from section a containing a summary 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.729
 of the general principles it concerns all 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.319
 that set of tools they allow 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:18.170
 the operator to be able to write the 

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:18.709
 verbal regulatory elements of character 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.170
 general 

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:22.819
 section b contains the indication of 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:27.979
 handbook of code violations 

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:30.800
 with laughter with the usual system of 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:33.440
 processing for case studies reported 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.110
 obviously to the regulatory index e 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.420
 therefore referred to the order in which 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.649
 this standard appears within the 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.380
 text of the highway code 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:44.899
 the section allows us to identify 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:48.020
 the operational diagrams for the application 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:51.619
 of the main sanctions and accessories 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.979
 in the section of we have gathered all 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:56.660
 the rules concerning the discipline 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:59.300
 trucking of people and things 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.310
 while in the section e have been 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.979
 gathered those norms that concern the 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.890
 transport discipline other than 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.940
 transport of things and people in 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.300
 section f 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:13.280
 all other complementary rules a little 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.299
 collected by order of importance of 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.400
 general character 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:17.720
 the section g finally 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.599
 contains all the provisions 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.640
 concerning the use of vehicles 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:24.379
 foreigners and of circulation on the 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.870
 national territory of vehicles and vehicles 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:29.480
 people residing in other states 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.750
 upon completion of the memorandum in 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.370
 the final part is the usual index which 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.209
 the exposures are divided into indexes 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:40.099
 and in alphabetical character index 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:43.250
 the index of exposures to a novelty 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:46.340
 which will allow the operator to be able to 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:49.250
 access the database directly 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.019
 iter penalties cds that is associated 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.280
 to the purchase of the handbook therefore with 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:56.540
 the purchase of the handbook is entitled 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:58.849
 to cds cds and with i 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.220
 references present within the 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:03.139
 handbook to be able to access all 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.409
 rules that have been referred to by 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:08.720
 handbook in the current version 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:12.500
 complete the alphabetical index with the 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.450
 usual accuracy as possible 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.629
 in order to make your work more 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.220
 the most immediate is the index 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:21.230
 probably the most important thing about 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.720
 this product because it allows you to 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:27.260
 access directly 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:29.859
 well focusing on the contents of 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.810
 new pages regarding hypotheses 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:35.359
 sanctions were made some 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.579
 additions that allow you to influence 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:39.859
 some multimedia or 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:43.459
 better manage the page let's start immediately 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:45.859
 to the qr code that appears inside 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:48.470
 each sanctioning hypothesis is 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:50.530
 of a code that through the use of 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:53.239
 smartphone or other devices 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.849
 specially built allows 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:59.000
 access by framing this code 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:01.699
 allows immediate access to the bank 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.459
 data iter penalties cds in which it is 

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:07.099
 the aforementioned rule contained in full 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:08.239
 therefore wanting to know the contents of 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:10.099
 an article 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:13.340
 pointing the smartphone on this object 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:16.370
 it is possible to go to extrapolate from 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:19.459
 sanction database cds the content 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:21.560
 integral of the other rule referred to 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:24.199
 important hypothesis other novelty 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.510
 important regards the introduction of 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:28.480
 a sanctioning hypothesis that is found 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.900
 then vertically with arisa market 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.910
 vertical orientation alongside 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:37.150
 additional penalties for each 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:39.490
 violation of this sanction hypothesis 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.440
 allows you to be able to do more 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.450
 easily cross-references 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.370
 within each case 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:48.460
 therefore within each standard 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:51.430
 violated are identified in order 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:53.970
 all the hypotheses are progressively increasing e 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:56.620
 then numbered with progressive number 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:58.720
 increasing and this number is needed 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.670
 within the operational notes for 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.670
 be able to more easily perform i 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:05.050
 recalls that these rules have to their own 

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:07.060
 internal then this operation 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.880
 should facilitate in a manner 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:12.790
 particular the research within the 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:15.340
 operational notes naturally still remain 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:18.430
 traditional scheme concerning the 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:21.030
 different graphic configuration of the hypo 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:23.830
 and sanctioning and enforcement 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:27.210
 of the penalty that have been revised 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.210
 only the graphic aspects
