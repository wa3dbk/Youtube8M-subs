00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
just because it balances out of the

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.710 
just because it balances out of the
center<00:02:14.100> doesn't<00:02:14.790> mean<00:02:14.940> it<00:02:15.090> bounces<00:02:15.450> out<00:02:15.600> at

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
center doesn't mean it bounces out at

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.780
