 Are you interested in football? 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.509

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:14.360
 So I was five years old and has only 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.160
 guys as friends 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.080
 and then I have football for me 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.609
 I decided earlier that I have ballet 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.680
 actually dances nothing at all 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.539
 say and then I'm so football 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.769
 come because someday both went 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.970
 no longer has me for soccer 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.800
 decided yes because it was just fun 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.989
 has power to play in the team and you have 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.309
 even more goals with a team 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.950
 here and now, reach the season or 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.750
 in the near future so this is so 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.550
 We definitely want the climb 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.290
 to create in the national league and in 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.600
 future because of course one more 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.719
 a bit further up 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:51.329
 yes, with a team the fun 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.890
 has together and just joy on 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.149
 football and celebrate together 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.609
 can said very successful at the moment 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.410
 a league is always first at the moment 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.570
 have now lost another ten game 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.920
 play yes and we want to continue 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.720
 work and we have to go further 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.799
 of course I wish very good wishes 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.280
 all good luck, of course 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.950
 I can still thank you for the future 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.420
 actually make the same question 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.580
 what do you want with your team? 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.950
 now reach at the fca 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.360
 yes, one has seen in contrast to 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.240
 last one also developed well for us 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.590
 have to exist as a team as a team 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.920
 table is already much better 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.540
 choose together and have matured and that 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.979
 is of course the class maintenance one will 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.119
 really stand as fast as possible 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.220
 make clear 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.159
 not like now that us the lot 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.350
 Ultimately it will be something for us with the ladies 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.909
 Of course, always interested is like 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.119
 look at a preparation for you 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.549
 a new one so it is with us 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.130
 a lot of running a lot like running 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.170
 it is very similar with you 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.820
 We have two to three units a day 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.829
 because of morning in the morning already running 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.500
 then have to move to a unit 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.119
 and at 15 o'clock about where we have a lot 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.170
 Of course, tactics also do a lot 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.990
 in the conditional area 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.720
 yes and so training now during the 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.310
 season so he makes a lot of tactical 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.370
 things are watching the game 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.870
 so how it goes as ye from us 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.090
 we always watch our own game very much 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.200
 Of course, we do our adversary 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.330
 very many tactical area in the 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.640
 we already work in the technical area 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.989
 very much and has consisted of 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.550
 also our training that we are there 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:28.050
 improve and get the moves in 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:30.430
 and call tactically and technically better 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.760
 how is the mood after the game with 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.200

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.209

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.500
 Well 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.660

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.269

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.709
