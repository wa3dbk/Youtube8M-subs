00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.819 
books of the Bible that we now consider
most<00:03:16.130> sacred<00:03:16.630> not<00:03:17.630> one<00:03:17.840> excavation<00:03:18.530> led<00:03:18.680> to

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:18.829 
most sacred not one excavation led to

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:21.370 
most sacred not one excavation led to
another<00:03:19.040> and<00:03:19.310> eventually<00:03:20.269> there<00:03:20.600> were<00:03:20.780> 11

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
another and eventually there were 11

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.349 
another and eventually there were 11
caves<00:03:21.709> in<00:03:22.010> which<00:03:22.040> scrolls<00:03:22.489> were<00:03:22.670> found<00:03:22.700> and

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:23.359 
caves in which scrolls were found and

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:25.840 
caves in which scrolls were found and
since<00:03:24.170> then<00:03:24.410> thousands<00:03:25.400> of<00:03:25.609> written

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
since then thousands of written

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.060 
since then thousands of written
fragments<00:03:26.359> have<00:03:26.510> been<00:03:26.540> upturned<00:03:27.079> and<00:03:27.739> many<00:03:27.920> of

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
fragments have been upturned and many of

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:29.830 
fragments have been upturned and many of
the<00:03:28.160> larger<00:03:28.579> manuscripts<00:03:29.120> have<00:03:29.209> been<00:03:29.390> damaged

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
the larger manuscripts have been damaged

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.539 
the larger manuscripts have been damaged
because<00:03:30.019> of<00:03:30.320> both<00:03:30.470> human<00:03:30.890> handling<00:03:31.250> and

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
because of both human handling and

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:34.390 
because of both human handling and
natural<00:03:32.420> causes<00:03:32.660> so<00:03:33.410> only<00:03:33.590> a<00:03:33.739> very<00:03:33.800> small

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
natural causes so only a very small

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.970 
natural causes so only a very small
portion<00:03:34.940> of<00:03:35.180> the<00:03:35.390> tech

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
portion of the tech

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:42.059 
portion of the tech
exist<00:03:36.870> but<00:03:37.870> there<00:03:38.769> were<00:03:39.159> a<00:03:40.650> small<00:03:41.650> number<00:03:41.680> of

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:42.069 
exist but there were a small number of

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:45.210 
exist but there were a small number of
manuscripts<00:03:42.940> that<00:03:43.090> were<00:03:43.900> well<00:03:44.769> preserved

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
manuscripts that were well preserved

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.690 
manuscripts that were well preserved
fewer<00:03:46.000> than<00:03:46.209> a<00:03:46.269> dozen<00:03:46.620> found<00:03:47.620> in<00:03:48.010> the<00:03:48.159> Qumran

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
fewer than a dozen found in the Qumran

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.270 
fewer than a dozen found in the Qumran
caves<00:03:49.120> and<00:03:49.450> many<00:03:49.989> archeologists<00:03:50.920> consider

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
caves and many archeologists consider

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:58.440 
caves and many archeologists consider
those<00:03:51.580> to<00:03:51.940> be<00:03:53.610> the<00:03:54.610> Dead<00:03:54.849> Sea<00:03:55.060> Scrolls<00:03:57.450> there

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
those to be the Dead Sea Scrolls there

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.210 
those to be the Dead Sea Scrolls there
have<00:03:58.569> been<00:03:58.660> so<00:03:58.900> many<00:03:58.959> excavations<00:03:59.830> in<00:04:00.040> that

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
have been so many excavations in that

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.229 
have been so many excavations in that
region<00:04:00.430> since<00:04:00.879> 1947<00:04:01.810> that<00:04:02.470> not<00:04:02.709> much<00:04:02.890> is<00:04:02.950> left

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
region since 1947 that not much is left

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:06.210 
region since 1947 that not much is left
no<00:04:04.239> stone<00:04:04.299> has<00:04:04.870> been<00:04:05.049> left<00:04:05.230> unturned<00:04:05.680> so<00:04:06.159> to

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
no stone has been left unturned so to

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.390 
no stone has been left unturned so to
