00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:13.870
 it is an unknown facet for a lot 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:16.420
 but now in the last years or more 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:19.120
 if it is unknown but it slowly and 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:22.510
 People are getting to know him 

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.920
 the people of the artists the authors and 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.210
 such because I've been a long time 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.869
 photographing is that people 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.869
 the great public 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:40.380
 doing this kind of stories 10 years 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.870
 the idea is now very important for 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:46.400
 help the deputation therapy that already 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.400
 we have spoken with the responsible 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:01:01.470
 and all the benefits on time and that 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:07.860
 was the beginning was getting involved with the 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:11.340
 foundation fills me with pride and one day 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.920
 I did not know at work and I proposed 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:20.100
 we make an exhibition with benefits 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:23.630
 play therapy and so I have the photos 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:27.010
 to use the photos for something that we 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:29.350
 to children 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.270
 and we did it and you stay the agreement 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:35.490
 special 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.490
 There have been some 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:41.759
 and it has been easier with this hour of 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.759
 do what 

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:59.159
 but it's a special relationship since 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:02:06.710
 many years and also I have already done 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:06.710
 he arrives to put the pictures and very curious 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:14.550
 I was surprised that surprised us 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.550
 thank you 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.470
 Never never 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:51.400
 It's a part of my project in sight 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:55.660
 already from the point of view of the program 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:57.900
 these things with the photographs and 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:01.340
 projects but I do not want to reveal them 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.340
 still not 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.150
 It is a question that comes to a 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:10.520
 character that has joined in this case 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:16.400
 still to be defined 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:16.400
 also with another collaborator collaborator 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.470
 I many things 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.850
 but for the science section it 's 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.970
 they have a team that also leads to 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:29.810
 section of the week I take my section of 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.810
 art to the beast 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:36.540
 I am a content generator of the 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.540
 television and also 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:44.099
 what I am going to say about the poems in 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:46.750
 the dialogue the least family yourself 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:49.120
 well there's a group of writers for the 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.470
 part of the program that I'm invited to 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.220
 what I believe are more contents of 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.569
 actions I have those great of 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.530
 scientific experiments that kind of 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:05.790
 things are what he prepared with my team 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:05.790
 as to how 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:10.540
 in real life 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:19.700
 the character 

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:22.540
 is known where I come from 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:24.950
 exchange a little 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.650
 because because they called me already a man 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.420
 in black from before leaving I have been 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:33.400
 always in black 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.400
 and always good always but from 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:41.770
 then its part of me but not in front of 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.770
 the clear between the character and me 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:52.120
 those responsible in the series of 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:54.400
 projects for example free entry 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.960
 nothing seen with what we are now is 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.290
 that we're going to start building the 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.290
 second 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:07.009
 and we are better 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:07.009
 we have the ones from madrid 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.639
 last question pablo motogp 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:17.260
 but not 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:20.320
 the truth is that no 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:22.440
 has managed to get this project to have a 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.440
 great method 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.440
 savior 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:39.530
 so it worked also and marbella 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:42.100
 and has been several times in the past 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:42.100
 months 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:55.949
 I go in the husband 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.949
 so is 

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:02.300
 delighted the first thing that comes to the idea 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:06.010
 all continue to support this initiative is 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.010
 as important as the foundation
