remember their names but 9 and 12 and

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.920 
remember their names but 9 and 12 and
they<00:01:32.549> seemingly<00:01:32.909> are<00:01:33.210> like<00:01:33.360> terrorists

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
they seemingly are like terrorists

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.090 
they seemingly are like terrorists
because<00:01:34.170> like<00:01:34.530> they're<00:01:34.710> making<00:01:34.860> little

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
because like they're making little

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.130 
because like they're making little
threats<00:01:35.579> on<00:01:35.790> YouTube<00:01:36.329> which<00:01:36.570> was<00:01:36.750> interesting

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
threats on YouTube which was interesting

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.230 
threats on YouTube which was interesting
that<00:01:37.229> they<00:01:37.350> used<00:01:37.560> YouTube<00:01:38.130> instead<00:01:38.880> of<00:01:38.970> Nico

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
that they used YouTube instead of Nico

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.240 
that they used YouTube instead of Nico
Nico<00:01:39.420> which<00:01:39.720> I'm<00:01:39.900> correct<00:01:40.200> in<00:01:40.350> Japan<00:01:40.950> Nico

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
Nico which I'm correct in Japan Nico

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.069 
Nico which I'm correct in Japan Nico
Nico<00:01:41.400> is<00:01:41.670> kind<00:01:41.880> of<00:01:41.939> like<00:01:42.030> their<00:01:42.210> YouTube<00:01:42.600> but<00:01:43.049> I

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
Nico is kind of like their YouTube but I

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.630 
Nico is kind of like their YouTube but I
guess<00:01:43.290> that's<00:01:43.500> just<00:01:43.560> like<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:43.920> statement<00:01:44.310> from

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
guess that's just like a statement from

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.700 
guess that's just like a statement from
Watanabe<00:01:45.270> because<00:01:45.540> if<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:45.899> see<00:01:46.079> from

that<00:02:15.720> is<00:02:15.840> seemingly<00:02:16.080> being<00:02:16.590> bullied<00:02:17.130> by<00:02:17.580> her

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
that is seemingly being bullied by her

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.340 
that is seemingly being bullied by her
classmates<00:02:18.000> and<00:02:18.600> I<00:02:18.780> don't<00:02:18.900> know<00:02:18.990> if<00:02:19.080> she<00:02:19.230> was

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
classmates and I don't know if she was

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.020 
classmates and I don't know if she was
sick<00:02:19.650> or<00:02:19.860> what<00:02:20.310> was<00:02:20.400> going<00:02:20.610> on<00:02:20.700> with<00:02:20.850> her<00:02:20.910> that

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
sick or what was going on with her that

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.220 
sick or what was going on with her that
she<00:02:21.150> kept<00:02:21.300> on<00:02:21.420> running<00:02:21.630> the<00:02:21.840> bathroom<00:02:22.140> and

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
she kept on running the bathroom and

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.300 
she kept on running the bathroom and
looked<00:02:22.380> like<00:02:22.470> she<00:02:22.590> was<00:02:22.710> picking<00:02:22.980> as<00:02:23.130> well<00:02:23.280> I

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
looked like she was picking as well I

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.850 
looked like she was picking as well I
think<00:02:23.400> a<00:02:23.700> lot<00:02:24.210> of<00:02:24.360> life<00:02:24.660> is<00:02:24.960> getting<00:02:25.260> turtle<00:02:25.710> of

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
think a lot of life is getting turtle of

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.290 
think a lot of life is getting turtle of
the<00:02:25.980> bullying<00:02:26.310> that's<00:02:26.460> happening<00:02:26.880> in<00:02:26.970> school

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
the bullying that's happening in school

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.970 
the bullying that's happening in school
and<00:02:27.540> I<00:02:28.110> guess<00:02:28.350> that's<00:02:28.530> something<00:02:28.710> that

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
and I guess that's something that

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.470 
and I guess that's something that
happens<00:02:29.280> in<00:02:29.370> Japan<00:02:29.490> I<00:02:29.730> mean<00:02:30.090> it<00:02:30.150> happens<00:02:30.420> all

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
happens in Japan I mean it happens all

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.640 
happens in Japan I mean it happens all
over<00:02:30.690> the<00:02:30.780> world<00:02:30.930> people<00:02:31.050> get<00:02:31.260> bullied<00:02:31.380> all

over the world people get bullied all

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:32.900 
over the world people get bullied all
over<00:02:31.860> the<00:02:31.950> world<00:02:32.160> but<00:02:32.280> I've<00:02:32.520> been<00:02:32.670> noticing
