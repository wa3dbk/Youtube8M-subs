00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.569

 hello youtube friends here again

 soul christel with a new video 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.080
 analysis to a great challenge exxtio between the 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:08.630
 users of the xbox band and fans of the 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.610
 dead rising like this is before leaving 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.010
 I will leave you this great video 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.200
 analysis so that they find out a little more 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.870
 about the game and give them all my points 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.910
 By the way, it's been a while since 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.400
 I wanted to do this analysis though 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.800
 I wanted to wait until I could finish 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.020
 this game by the way a greeting to me 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.750
 friend sergio who lent me his xbox one 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.420
 a good time xd without further ado 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.640
 I will start the video and remember this is 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.979
 an opinion of mine personally as 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.020
 knowledgeable experienced however not 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:43.390
 expert since it works for me 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.390
 complicated these games so good xd 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.600
 let's start with the drama as you well know 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.900
 this franchise is characterized by the 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.600
 typical zombie apocalypse incident the 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.520
 which has as unknown cause this 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.830
 delivery occurs ten years after the 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.709
 second installment or tragedy in fortune 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:11.620
 city and if I refer the second delivery 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:13.630
 no to the of of the records good now 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.440
 there was a new apocalypse in a village 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.630
 Of California 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.270
 certainly non-existent called the 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.610
 lost in which a young man named nin 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.560
 grams will be occupied throughout the 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.019
 outbreak with the sole purpose of following 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.330
 go ahead and escape the infection with 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:30.820
 some departures which will be of 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.920
 utility in the game nor what to find 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:36.069
 many more people who will be able 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.290
 ally and all those things a skill 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:40.209
 has a particularity which is its 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.970
 great handling and creativity with 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.790
 tools since this one is mechanical and 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.440
 little by little that it is progressing 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.690
 will discover the truth behind the outbreak in 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.730
 the particular the plot of this game is 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.920
 very similar in terms of the objective as 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.780
 any other but they have their 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.380
 differences which makes them 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.380
 singular 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.200
 then let's go with the good mechanics this 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.330
 it is undoubtedly the one that makes the 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.580
 game let's start with the big ones 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.680
 scenarios with various objects to 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.590
 remove zombies xd 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.970
 Well, let's start with the important thing 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.640
 this dead rising will be divided by 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.890
 chapters which will ask for requirements 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.660
 before finishing or passing without mentioning 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.390
 the time limit that you have for 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.670
 effecting these in these chapters have 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.709
 that rescue survivors stuck in 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.300
 some part of the city as well as 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:41.360
 defend yourself from enemy sides 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:43.150
 zombies and psychopaths which 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.830
 they will only focus on killing you 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.110
 as you go forward you will find 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.510
 answers about what really happens 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.760
 as well as you will know variety of people 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.400
 although few will be of help to the 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.230
 just like dead rising 2 you can count 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.690
 with combo cards which you 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.700
 will facilitate work and super letters 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.489
 combo that I think you already know so that they 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.890
 will help good however as in the 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:08.810
 other deliveries there are a variety of things 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.959
 that will help you to finish all the 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.850
 zombies well planned many things 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:16.040
 according to the story taking 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.600
 meet new goals as well 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.060
 eliminate the various crazy or 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.950
 psychopaths who will interpose you for 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.080
 complete the story there is a limit of 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:26.240
 time however there is a game mode 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.490
 called nightmare which has a 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.410
 more limited and more difficult time for 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.540
 meet the game is also the 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:35.570
 multiplayer which is based on two 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:37.400
 characters one will take on the role of nick and 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.650
 another one of his friend dick who is a 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.870
 truck driver who arrived in the city between 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.300
 the two will be able to face the hordes 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.670
 of zombies and all that some 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.450
 kinematics change if these are played 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.450
 of two characters 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:04.990
 in conclusion the adri without 3 is 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.630
 extremely good with a very good and ximo 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.820
 mechanical plot and excellent graphics that 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:12.580
 make the game look like 100 and over 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:14.740
 all its great originality although this 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.050
 game to compile to several by the 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.360
 environment or patience that he needs 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.520
 to pass some very difficult parts 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:24.010
 or simply to level up 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.620
 xd I think that I should have said that in 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:28.930
 the mechanics lol no doubt I know that this 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.670
 game will be liked by many so 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:33.730
 which I decided to do the video analysis 

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:35.830
 Although this is very short, it is good that 

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:38.050
 now they will be very short because 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:40.600
 I want to be very direct in my points and 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:42.550
 do not go around the good thing 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.710
 but in conclusion this game by the 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:47.140
 moment is the one that undoubtedly represents 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:49.270
 xbox one the only negative thing that I can 

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:51.280
 find this game is without a doubt the 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:54.910
 same uniqueness that is found in 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:56.890
 the xbox band and not in pc or ps4 which 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:59.080
 would make it much more popular among all 

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:02.080
 users since I also 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:03.910
 piss off not being able to buy xd but so 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:06.220
