00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.230
 hello girls and here is the new video of 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.150
 nail art I will show you a france with 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.400
 of sequins and micro-painting 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.849
 this is the end result I hope there is 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.039
 like 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.830
 having prepared the nail having put 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.380
 the base gel and catalyzed I do 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.390
 another basic pass and with the 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.130
 brush only on the tip I go to 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.670
 apply the scouring pads of this color 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.769
 wonderful that I bought at the fair 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.040
 now you can do this in art 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.129
 in two ways or in this way as you are 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.620
 therefore seeing at this very moment 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:42.989
 france is already invaded 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:47.820
 catalyzed sequins and then do the 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:51.030
 cover or alternative you can do 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.520
 first the cover then outline the 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.180
 snai line put gel pucca 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.920
 finger inside the sequins catalyze and 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:03.719
 when you go to degrease the scourers 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:08.990
 in excess I am eliminated 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.990
 I show both options 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.930
 of course try to flatten well 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.820
 scourers because they don't have to do 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.259
 thickness since the tip must be 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.229
 thin 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:22.619
 I did the first method then one 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.479
 once catalyzed I go to lengthen the 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.170
 nail bed I make the first pass 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.880
 nail polish with the pink cover and then I go to 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.799
 stretch the bed with the ball a 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.189
 a little bigger than usual 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:38.820
 so I bring it well to the side 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:42.240
 towards the tip I outline the smile ain well 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.520
 and the good smoking in this case has me 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.799
 fired a little bit and then I clean well 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.899
 lateral outline the smile ain e better 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:52.649
 catalizzing after that I do the 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.899
 crowning and beginning animate in such a way 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.719
 that the tip is pretty thin now 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.030
 let's move on to the art takes the colors 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:03.290
 christanell acrylics are blue 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.759
 that white is the brush at move 2 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.270
 the first thing to do is to recreate one 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.860
 butterfly on the thumb 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.250
 naturally it didn't come out very well 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.860
 because I'm not satisfied at all 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:19.590
 but I had little time as it came 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.450
 patience comes and goes to support the 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.330
 brush on one side in white e 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.370
 on the other side in the blue I do the 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.440
 strips on the sheet so that i 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.880
 two colors mix well and I go 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:34.190
 to recreate the first la of the butterfly 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:40.020
 always with the technique to move 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:42.120
 then it goes from recreating the other wing as 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.700
 just see from the video is easier to 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.490
 see that to explain after that it goes by 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.370
 do the second pass to make the 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:52.320
 more intense color 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:56.130
 after which I always take the black color 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:59.190
 of the crystal which is precisely the color 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.930
 one move by crystal nails and with the 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.720
 tweak you go from diluting for good the 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:12.150
 color and goes from recreating the contours of the 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:16.160
 butterfly doing also precisely the 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.160
 small body and the two antennas 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.989
 he said this butterfly is not me 

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:29.810
 liked it very much I could have done it better 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:32.829
 pity that I had very little 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.829
 time to make it happen 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:38.180
 so it doesn't make me crazy 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:41.420
 however, all in all so bad 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.280
 then it didn't come even though I could 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:47.150
 really do much better anyway 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:49.609
 nevertheless I hope you like it 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.620
 the same 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:55.819
 I thought however to let you see it 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:59.739
 because as you all know I am not 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:03.109
 a professional indeed 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:05.859
 improve and learn even from those who know 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:08.389
 more welcome 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:10.569
 then with the needle I always take the 

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:15.049
 white and goes from recreating the dots 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:17.200
 nor the outline of the wings of the 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:17.200
 butterfly 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:23.120
 as for the others 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:27.650
 I just make dots of nails 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:32.750
 as you see on the video the lines on all 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:35.780
 four nails this however 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.659
 Finished nail art was very simple 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.639
 very fast to make 

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:42.590
 I hope you enjoyed the video there 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:45.400
 I send a big kiss to the next one 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.400
 hello video
