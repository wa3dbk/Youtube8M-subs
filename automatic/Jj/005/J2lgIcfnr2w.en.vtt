00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.160 
now one thing to notice is this castle

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.880 
now one thing to notice is this castle
on<00:00:36.550> the<00:00:36.640> outside<00:00:37.360> just<00:00:37.960> looks<00:00:38.199> terrible<00:00:38.710> it

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
on the outside just looks terrible it

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.560 
on the outside just looks terrible it
really<00:00:39.160> doesn't<00:00:39.489> represent<00:00:39.640> it<00:00:40.000> and<00:00:40.180> it's<00:00:40.449> a

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.570 
really doesn't represent it and it's a

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:41.729 
really doesn't represent it and it's a
little<00:00:40.780> bit<00:00:40.870> different<00:00:41.170> from<00:00:41.260> the<00:00:41.350> screenshot

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:41.739 
little bit different from the screenshot

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:44.070 
little bit different from the screenshot
because<00:00:42.129> there<00:00:42.580> is<00:00:42.699> a<00:00:42.730> texture<00:00:43.420> pack<00:00:43.600> that

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:44.080 
because there is a texture pack that

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.079 
because there is a texture pack that
it's<00:00:44.230> supposed<00:00:44.500> to<00:00:44.589> go<00:00:44.800> along<00:00:44.949> with<00:00:45.250> this<00:00:45.820> and

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:46.089 
it's supposed to go along with this and

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:49.229 
it's supposed to go along with this and
I<00:00:46.989> will<00:00:47.650> put<00:00:47.860> it<00:00:47.949> in<00:00:48.100> the<00:00:48.220> description<00:00:48.580> in<00:00:48.850> case

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
I will put it in the description in case

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:51.780 
I will put it in the description in case
