like<00:00:41.020> black<00:00:41.410> ops<00:00:41.650> 2<00:00:41.950> but<00:00:42.760> the<00:00:42.880> way<00:00:43.030> they've

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:43.240 
like black ops 2 but the way they've

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.060 
like black ops 2 but the way they've
named<00:00:43.450> this<00:00:43.660> map<00:00:43.930> is<00:00:43.960> that<00:00:44.410> at<00:00:44.620> the<00:00:44.770> actual

advanced warfare Studios it was cold i

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.560 
advanced warfare Studios it was cold i
believe<00:00:47.620> it<00:00:47.770> was<00:00:47.830> project<00:00:48.310> to<00:00:48.400> venus<00:00:48.730> and<00:00:48.940> then

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 
believe it was project to venus and then

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.020 
believe it was project to venus and then
later<00:00:49.930> on<00:00:50.050> every<00:00:50.680> named<00:00:50.920> it<00:00:51.130> to<00:00:51.310> retreat<00:00:51.850> and

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
later on every named it to retreat and

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.420 
later on every named it to retreat and
that's<00:00:52.300> how<00:00:52.870> we<00:00:52.930> get<00:00:53.200> the<00:00:53.350> name<00:00:53.560> retreat<00:00:54.100> now

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
basically like a tour of the map that

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.940 
basically like a tour of the map that

was more indoors and i believe on the

right<00:01:27.759> side<00:01:28.030> of<00:01:28.210> plaza<00:01:28.420> it<00:01:28.780> depends<00:01:29.469> if<00:01:29.560> you

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:29.649 
right side of plaza it depends if you

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:31.770 
right side of plaza it depends if you
spawn<00:01:29.950> but<00:01:30.130> it<00:01:30.249> was<00:01:30.369> more<00:01:30.549> open<00:01:30.789> and<00:01:31.149> to<00:01:31.659> be

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
spawn but it was more open and to be

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.289 
spawn but it was more open and to be
honest<00:01:32.109> if<00:01:32.229> you<00:01:32.319> have<00:01:32.499> a<00:01:32.530> look<00:01:33.249> at<00:01:33.429> Plaza<00:01:33.850> and

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:34.299 
honest if you have a look at Plaza and

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:36.149 
honest if you have a look at Plaza and
then<00:01:34.479> you<00:01:34.600> move<00:01:34.840> to<00:01:34.869> advanced<00:01:35.319> warfare<00:01:35.740> you

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
then you move to advanced warfare you

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:37.260 
then you move to advanced warfare you
can<00:01:36.310> kind<00:01:36.520> of<00:01:36.670> see<00:01:36.729> some<00:01:37.060> similarities

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
can kind of see some similarities

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.629 
can kind of see some similarities
although<00:01:38.200> this<00:01:38.350> could<00:01:38.590> be<00:01:38.740> a<00:01:38.770> different<00:01:39.369> map

00:01:39.629 --> 00:01:39.639 
although this could be a different map

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:41.730 
although this could be a different map
now<00:01:40.270> usually<00:01:40.569> what<00:01:40.899> they<00:01:41.020> do<00:01:41.079> with<00:01:41.409> advanced

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
now usually what they do with advanced

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.649 
now usually what they do with advanced
warfare<00:01:42.189> maps<00:01:42.459> or<00:01:42.639> call<00:01:42.819> of<00:01:42.969> duty<00:01:43.240> maps<00:01:43.450> in

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 
warfare maps or call of duty maps in

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:45.840 
warfare maps or call of duty maps in
general<00:01:44.079> is<00:01:44.229> that<00:01:44.920> they<00:01:45.100> have<00:01:45.279> single<00:01:45.639> player

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
general is that they have single player

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.269 
general is that they have single player
maps<00:01:46.119> and<00:01:46.389> then<00:01:46.749> they<00:01:47.139> basically<00:01:47.740> bring<00:01:48.100> that

00:01:48.269 --> 00:01:48.279 
maps and then they basically bring that

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:50.669 
maps and then they basically bring that
into<00:01:48.579> multiplayer<00:01:48.939> with<00:01:49.719> a<00:01:49.929> lot<00:01:50.170> of<00:01:50.200> tweaks

00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:50.679 
into multiplayer with a lot of tweaks

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:52.980 
into multiplayer with a lot of tweaks
now<00:01:50.979> what<00:01:51.639> this<00:01:51.819> multiplayer<00:01:52.389> map<00:01:52.719> is

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
now what this multiplayer map is

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.779 
now what this multiplayer map is
actually<00:01:53.529> as<00:01:53.619> a<00:01:53.649> single-player<00:01:54.249> mission

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:54.789 
actually as a single-player mission

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:56.879 
actually as a single-player mission

00:01:56.879 --> 00:01:56.889 
which is the president I believe this is

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:58.199 
which is the president I believe this is

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
it's nice to see that this is a small

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.500 
it's nice to see that this is a small
map<00:02:53.570> all<00:02:53.780> round<00:02:54.489> I'm<00:02:55.489> my<00:02:55.670> call<00:02:55.910> of<00:02:56.000> duty<00:02:56.269> ghosts

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
map all round I'm my call of duty ghosts

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.060 
map all round I'm my call of duty ghosts
where<00:02:56.750> I<00:02:56.780> feel<00:02:57.050> that<00:02:57.170> the<00:02:57.290> maps<00:02:57.500> are<00:02:57.620> a<00:02:57.680> bit<00:02:57.890> too

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
where I feel that the maps are a bit too

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:59.949 
where I feel that the maps are a bit too
big<00:02:58.340> so<00:02:58.790> it<00:02:58.820> looks<00:02:59.060> like<00:02:59.120> fast-paced<00:02:59.600> action

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
big so it looks like fast-paced action

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.440 
big so it looks like fast-paced action
will<00:03:00.350> happen<00:03:00.739> on<00:03:00.860> this<00:03:00.920> map<00:03:01.370> and<00:03:01.610> depending<00:03:02.330> if

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
will happen on this map and depending if

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.660 
will happen on this map and depending if
you're<00:03:02.540> a<00:03:02.570> sniper<00:03:02.930> or<00:03:03.440> someone<00:03:04.160> who<00:03:04.280> likes<00:03:04.489> to

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
you're a sniper or someone who likes to

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.160 
you're a sniper or someone who likes to
rush<00:03:04.880> I<00:03:05.090> believe<00:03:05.300> this<00:03:05.480> map<00:03:05.720> will<00:03:05.930> do<00:03:06.140> very

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
rush I believe this map will do very

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.290 
rush I believe this map will do very
well<00:03:06.470> just<00:03:06.830> because<00:03:07.160> it's<00:03:07.280> got<00:03:07.400> long<00:03:07.790> lines<00:03:08.150> of

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
well just because it's got long lines of

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.060 
well just because it's got long lines of
sight<00:03:08.480> and<00:03:08.720> it's<00:03:08.900> got<00:03:09.050> some<00:03:09.230> good<00:03:09.470> cover<00:03:09.739> up

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
sight and it's got some good cover up

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:11.830 
sight and it's got some good cover up
for<00:03:10.519> your<00:03:10.580> advantage<00:03:11.120> if<00:03:11.330> you're<00:03:11.450> going<00:03:11.630> to<00:03:11.720> be

going in any gunfights in advanced
warfare<00:03:14.420> so<00:03:14.870> as<00:03:14.959> you<00:03:15.050> can<00:03:15.140> see<00:03:15.320> already<00:03:15.470> this

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
warfare so as you can see already this

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.949 
warfare so as you can see already this
map<00:03:16.190> does<00:03:16.550> look<00:03:16.850> very<00:03:16.880> good<00:03:17.420> a<00:03:17.480> lot<00:03:17.630> of<00:03:17.750> people

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
map does look very good a lot of people

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:19.539 
map does look very good a lot of people
have<00:03:18.050> been<00:03:18.170> complaining<00:03:18.320> about<00:03:18.799> the<00:03:19.070> detail

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
have been complaining about the detail

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:21.729 
have been complaining about the detail
of<00:03:19.579> the<00:03:19.880> maps<00:03:20.120> but<00:03:20.329> personally<00:03:20.870> I<00:03:21.049> think<00:03:21.290> the

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
of the maps but personally I think the

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:23.800 
of the maps but personally I think the
detail<00:03:22.220> is<00:03:22.400> just<00:03:22.640> fine<00:03:22.940> and<00:03:23.209> it<00:03:23.299> isn't<00:03:23.660> really

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
detail is just fine and it isn't really

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.870 
detail is just fine and it isn't really
that<00:03:24.140> necessary<00:03:24.380> when<00:03:24.950> it<00:03:25.070> comes<00:03:25.250> to<00:03:25.400> gameplay

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
that necessary when it comes to gameplay

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.360 
that necessary when it comes to gameplay
bar<00:03:26.090> when<00:03:26.180> it<00:03:26.299> comes<00:03:26.480> to<00:03:26.660> graphics<00:03:26.900> it<00:03:27.320> does<00:03:28.040> do

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
bar when it comes to graphics it does do

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.100 
bar when it comes to graphics it does do
a<00:03:28.400> lot<00:03:28.519> now<00:03:28.910> and<00:03:29.120> also<00:03:29.450> a<00:03:29.480> lot<00:03:29.660> of<00:03:29.690> people<00:03:29.959> been

I<00:03:33.920> can<00:03:34.130> correspond<00:03:34.700> to<00:03:34.760> that<00:03:34.880> but<00:03:35.570> also<00:03:35.810> we

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
I can correspond to that but also we

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.259 
I can correspond to that but also we
don't<00:03:36.350> know<00:03:36.560> for<00:03:36.799> a<00:03:36.829> fact<00:03:37.160> if<00:03:37.489> that<00:03:37.940> this<00:03:38.120> is

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
don't know for a fact if that this is

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:39.789 
don't know for a fact if that this is
the<00:03:38.390> final<00:03:38.780> map<00:03:38.959> it<00:03:39.110> could<00:03:39.260> just<00:03:39.380> be<00:03:39.500> a<00:03:39.590> beta

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 
the final map it could just be a beta

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:41.830 
the final map it could just be a beta
stage<00:03:40.190> or<00:03:40.519> it<00:03:40.820> could<00:03:41.000> just<00:03:41.030> be<00:03:41.329> in<00:03:41.630> development

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.410 
stage or it could just be in development
still<00:03:42.650> but<00:03:43.100> personally<00:03:43.519> I<00:03:43.579> do<00:03:43.700> like<00:03:44.030> this<00:03:44.180> map

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
still but personally I do like this map

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:45.640 
still but personally I do like this map
as<00:03:44.630> they're<00:03:44.810> adding<00:03:45.079> in<00:03:45.230> different

as they're adding in different

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.560 
as they're adding in different
verticality<00:03:46.220> and<00:03:46.579> they're<00:03:47.060> just<00:03:47.180> trying<00:03:47.510> to

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:47.570 
verticality and they're just trying to

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:49.780 
verticality and they're just trying to
bring<00:03:47.959> out<00:03:48.110> some<00:03:48.320> dynamic<00:03:48.829> events<00:03:48.980> within<00:03:49.519> the

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
bring out some dynamic events within the

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.240 
bring out some dynamic events within the

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
that this is a possible Plaza remake

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.300 
that this is a possible Plaza remake
personally<00:04:05.780> I<00:04:05.810> could<00:04:06.110> see<00:04:06.320> it<00:04:06.470> being<00:04:06.500> although

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
personally I could see it being although

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.009 
personally I could see it being although
it<00:04:07.370> kind<00:04:07.640> of<00:04:07.760> doesn't<00:04:08.030> look<00:04:08.329> like<00:04:08.510> it<00:04:08.660> but<00:04:08.780> in<00:04:08.930> a

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
it kind of doesn't look like it but in a

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:11.410 
it kind of doesn't look like it but in a
way<00:04:09.200> it<00:04:09.350> does<00:04:09.590> because<00:04:09.799> it<00:04:10.040> is<00:04:10.130> a<00:04:10.160> bit<00:04:10.400> more<00:04:10.549> has

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
way it does because it is a bit more has

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:12.970 
way it does because it is a bit more has
a<00:04:11.450> bit<00:04:11.660> more<00:04:11.780> verticality<00:04:12.380> than<00:04:12.650> Plaza

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
a bit more verticality than Plaza

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.430 
a bit more verticality than Plaza
actually<00:04:13.700> does<00:04:13.970> but<00:04:14.510> nonetheless<00:04:14.690> hopefully

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
actually does but nonetheless hopefully
