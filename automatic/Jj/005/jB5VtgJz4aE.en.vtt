00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
I think it's a stupid move for Disney to

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.610 
I think it's a stupid move for Disney to
do<00:02:23.400> this<00:02:23.700> and<00:02:24.060> in<00:02:24.780> addition<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.230> flick<00:02:25.410> and<00:02:25.440> I

minute<00:02:27.750> well<00:02:28.400> James<00:02:29.400> you<00:02:29.910> probably<00:02:30.360> may<00:02:30.569> be

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
right and I know I think you did say

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.460 
right and I know I think you did say
clearly<00:02:32.700> but<00:02:32.940> sometimes<00:02:33.900> you<00:02:34.170> might<00:02:34.319> have

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
clearly but sometimes you might have

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.650 
clearly but sometimes you might have
said<00:02:34.709> it<00:02:34.739> a<00:02:34.920> little<00:02:35.220> bit<00:02:35.459> too<00:02:35.730> out<00:02:35.910> of<00:02:36.090> context

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
said it a little bit too out of context

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.130 
said it a little bit too out of context
but<00:02:37.610> because<00:02:38.610> because<00:02:39.120> if<00:02:39.390> you<00:02:39.569> didn't<00:02:40.020> you

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140
