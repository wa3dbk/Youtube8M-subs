actually<00:01:06.140> found<00:01:06.320> that<00:01:06.439> really<00:01:06.650> interesting<00:01:07.310> I

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
actually found that really interesting I

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.690 
actually found that really interesting I
mean<00:01:09.080> I<00:01:09.110> guess<00:01:09.229> it<00:01:09.590> worked<00:01:09.830> out<00:01:09.979> for<00:01:10.250> him<00:01:10.310> it

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
mean I guess it worked out for him it

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.550 
mean I guess it worked out for him it
was<00:01:10.790> definitely<00:01:11.030> is<00:01:11.750> another<00:01:11.990> stall<00:01:12.229> fusion

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
was definitely is another stall fusion

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.270 
was definitely is another stall fusion
in<00:01:12.619> the<00:01:12.710> back<00:01:12.890> I<00:01:13.180> mean<00:01:14.180> and<00:01:14.479> it<00:01:14.570> works<00:01:14.750> it's<00:01:15.280> it

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
in the back I mean and it works it's it

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.590 
in the back I mean and it works it's it
works<00:01:16.430> out<00:01:16.610> for<00:01:16.790> him<00:01:16.850> it<00:01:17.000> definitely<00:01:17.090> opens<00:01:17.509> up

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
works out for him it definitely opens up

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.940 
works out for him it definitely opens up
a<00:01:17.659> lot<00:01:17.689> more<00:01:17.960> plays<00:01:18.200> when<00:01:18.439> you<00:01:18.530> don't<00:01:18.740> see<00:01:18.890> your

thought<00:01:52.040> that<00:01:52.100> was<00:01:52.189> kind<00:01:52.369> of<00:01:52.399> slow<00:01:52.700> not<00:01:53.030> I

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
thought that was kind of slow not I

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.730 
thought that was kind of slow not I
actually<00:01:53.600> forgot<00:01:53.869> to<00:01:54.079> ask<00:01:54.200> him<00:01:54.380> how<00:01:54.560> that

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
actually forgot to ask him how that

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.100 
actually forgot to ask him how that
worked<00:01:54.920> for<00:01:55.040> him<00:01:55.100> but<00:01:55.399> he<00:01:55.790> ran<00:01:56.240> in<00:01:56.509> unless<00:01:56.840> I

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
worked for him but he ran in unless I

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:58.840 
worked for him but he ran in unless I
thought<00:01:57.469> it<00:01:57.530> was<00:01:57.619> pretty<00:01:57.710> interesting<00:01:58.009> he<00:01:58.700> ran

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
thought it was pretty interesting he ran

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.060

the<00:02:01.159> TK<00:02:01.490> factor<00:02:01.909> I<00:02:01.969> think<00:02:02.149> he<00:02:02.600> said<00:02:02.810> that<00:02:02.930> he'd

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
the TK factor I think he said that he'd

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.170 
the TK factor I think he said that he'd
actually<00:02:03.380> like<00:02:03.799> to<00:02:03.920> up<00:02:04.070> this<00:02:04.340> maybe<00:02:04.939> replace

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
actually like to up this maybe replace

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.609 
actually like to up this maybe replace

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
that double cyclone for traps done if

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:07.840 
that double cyclone for traps done if

recall all the all the choices he said
he<00:02:09.530> might<00:02:09.650> change<00:02:09.890> but<00:02:10.520> trap<00:02:10.940> stone<00:02:11.120> is<00:02:11.180> pretty

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
he might change but trap stone is pretty

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.000

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
guess it worked for him i'm not i'm not

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.540

all<00:03:08.930> day<00:03:09.110> but<00:03:09.190> it's<00:03:10.190> obviously<00:03:10.459> for<00:03:10.640> burning

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
all day but it's obviously for burning

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
abyss matchup and you know a lot of

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:13.960 
abyss matchup and you know a lot of
people<00:03:12.739> just<00:03:13.100> say<00:03:13.220> this<00:03:13.400> crowd<00:03:13.550> sucks<00:03:13.790> some

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
people just say this crowd sucks some

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.729 
people just say this crowd sucks some
people<00:03:14.180> are<00:03:14.540> trying<00:03:14.780> it<00:03:15.080> some<00:03:15.230> people<00:03:15.320> love<00:03:15.560> it

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
people are trying it some people love it

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:17.140 
people are trying it some people love it
I<00:03:15.769> think<00:03:16.100> it's<00:03:16.310> a<00:03:16.370> really<00:03:16.489> double<00:03:16.820> edge<00:03:16.910> card

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
I think it's a really double edge card

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.820 
I think it's a really double edge card
like<00:03:17.390> it<00:03:17.540> could<00:03:17.660> be<00:03:17.690> dead<00:03:18.110> really<00:03:18.380> easily<00:03:18.650> but

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
like it could be dead really easily but

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:20.170 
like it could be dead really easily but
it<00:03:18.920> could<00:03:19.010> also<00:03:19.070> really<00:03:19.640> just<00:03:19.820> cripple<00:03:20.090> your

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
it could also really just cripple your

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.660 
it could also really just cripple your
opponent<00:03:20.540> if<00:03:20.600> it<00:03:20.720> resolves<00:03:21.040> one<00:03:22.040> mal<00:03:22.250> cat<00:03:22.489> for

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
opponent if it resolves one mal cat for

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.910 
opponent if it resolves one mal cat for
the<00:03:22.760> blowout<00:03:23.120> and<00:03:23.360> double<00:03:23.630> rivalry<00:03:24.110> and<00:03:24.320> then

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
the blowout and double rivalry and then

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.699 
the blowout and double rivalry and then
three<00:03:25.459> constructs<00:03:26.030> and<00:03:26.269> two<00:03:26.390> windows<00:03:26.810> you

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
three constructs and two windows you

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:28.930 
three constructs and two windows you
runs<00:03:27.890> artifact<00:03:28.310> engine<00:03:28.640> so<00:03:28.760> I<00:03:28.790> definitely

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
runs artifact engine so I definitely

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.370 
runs artifact engine so I definitely
needs<00:03:29.299> the<00:03:29.450> three<00:03:29.600> constructs<00:03:29.989> and<00:03:30.170> you<00:03:30.260> also

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
needs the three constructs and you also

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.069 
needs the three constructs and you also
runs<00:03:30.590> polymerization<00:03:31.130> so<00:03:31.610> it<00:03:32.150> works<00:03:32.329> out<00:03:32.510> one

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:33.079 
runs polymerization so it works out one

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:35.680
