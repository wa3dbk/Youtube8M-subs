00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 Welcome to the first right 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.410
 10 with video from 2014 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.240
 this is an insight of the cebit 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.870
 Everyone sees everything because of everything 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.700
 air france I think that was 38 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:17.190
 was recorded the first day on 10 march 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.570
 i was already on site 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.640
 ticket sometimes also has its advantages 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.260
 You can get a first impression 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.740
 procure before the actual 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.590
 bustle starts final 15 that you see 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.720
 right now for you is a major part 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.940
 the hardware has been seen anyway 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.219
 the adria that interests me in the 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.930
 so-called reseller planet is coming 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.480
 unfortunately not everyone purely because of that 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.090
 press ticket therefore I can give you one 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.620
 few things show in the background 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.230
 This is seen by the Catholic 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.170
 press center and from there I have to 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.969
 try with wlan one year of videos 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.600
 to upload what did not work because 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:57.660
 the wlan on the cebit unfortunately me very much 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.309
 send positive or insufficient 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.600
 First of all, let's have a look first 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.600
 few impressions of the cebit 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:22.340
 merry christmas in conversation 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:26.630
 So many beautiful to see two weeks 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:30.040
 we are back in the middle of the same 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.040
 look first start-up 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.420
 sometimes read 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.229
 build something 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.740
 there are 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.360
 silverstone 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:22.019
 he is so the classic range of cables 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:28.950
 fan series down the network side 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:28.950
 damaging sizes also rather classic 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:50.620
 that miller and bad music 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.299
 Now turn around and have a nice day 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.710
 click for it 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.010
 folded 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.970
 we want to see very nice now 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.769
 Of course, intel was also on the spot 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.269
 who read my blog I link it 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:32.900
 times down in the infobox like times 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:34.310
 look into 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.950
 I have a bit too intel 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.510
 log cabin written as said inter 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.430
 was also on the spot in paris eleven of them 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:44.660
 could have your selected products below 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:48.799
 introduce to intel in nord lb forum 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:51.079
 a closer video will follow tomorrow 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:52.730
 there is a blog post as I said 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:54.170
 you like to read through it and now 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.629
 we are also in be the same be 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.549
 quiet 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:04:00.829
 the stand of far away is also in the 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:02.319
 hall 15 in the so-called reseller plans 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:04.370
 that's probably why 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:07.010
 probably not all of you 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.780
 but you came over this 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.930
 Now you can take a look at it 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:14.569
 of course there were the current ones 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:17.690
 cooler and fan to see in particular 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:18.919
 the dark rock pro 3 where I am always 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.299
 still trying that I the 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:22.690
 maybe can imagine 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:25.039
 There are a few down here 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.630
 smaller or special 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:28.669
 power supplies that way a little bit different 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.010
 look like the one you commonly do 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:33.770
 knows or also obstruct 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:37.160
 would be here in the background power supplies and 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:39.710
 fan as well as cpu cooler rear 1000 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.650
 watt power supply I think that can already 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.990
 I've already come out last year 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:48.260
 that's so right here in front too 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:50.060
 a thermally conductive paste called the c1 is me 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.400
 I think so be quite meanwhile 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.190
 a fairly large range of products which 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.970
 Of course, I find it impressive too 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.440
 I once again a little bit 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.660
 requested by be quiet 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.979
 I hope that I have you too now 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:04.250
 a little bit of it again soon 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:06.320
 can think about it later was that was 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:09.320
 the cebit on the first day i kick 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.910
 cameraman in short so the weather is 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.280
 beautiful there can not say anything else 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.680
 It is also so warm that you can 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.570
 does not think so again 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.370
 Great days just inside and outside 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:20.000
 good on the cebit also a bit 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:21.740
 be on the move 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.479
 I'll see that I have some pictures 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.370
 one cuts so you see the terrain 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:26.750
 are not bad are many 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.310
 go to people but also notes so 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:29.810
 a bit that now only in 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:33.370
 quotes business to business 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:35.080
 so is the duck user the user 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.850
 maybe a whole lot of that 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.800
 flair so far have been missed 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:40.830
 Unfortunately I think that it is one 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.560
 Wrong decision was the cebit 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.130
 to exclude these users only 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.419
 business-to-business permit 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:48.419
 Perhaps that will change again 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:50.860
 dear cebit is about a change 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:52.360
 and let the other users too 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:54.180
 because the power is more fun when 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.260
 more people are on the way and by the way 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:58.030
 some exhibitors are not there either 

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.690
 So , very much, for example, I have 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:01.510
 not found 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:03.280
 others can be represented or have 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:04.660
 really only very small minimum 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.770
 stalls october for example i have 

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:08.199
 I will not be there tomorrow 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:10.210
 watch again and time first 

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:11.949
 Back to my hotel will be a bit 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:13.330
 blog I link the blog 

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:14.919
 if I do not forget me 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.850
 I hope I can watch the second video today 

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:17.620
 also upload 

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:20.080
 I still have the first one on the 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:21.639
 cebit was here fairgrounds with lte 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.440
 need to upload from the telecom 

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:25.510
 thanks that at least worked 

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.310
 and the rest we'll see if I can 

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:30.130
 also so go and hear otherwise 

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:32.650
 see you in two three days if 

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:33.490
 I'll be back okay then until then yes 

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:36.580
 and finally a bit 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:38.760
 impressions from the c to 2014 until 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:38.760
 then
