00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 hi guys and welcome back with a 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.310
 brand new video 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.470
 today we are on make the fall if there is 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.040
 remember a while ago I did a 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.290
 make the jump which was a game in which 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:16.680
 we had to jump over obstacles but it was 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.330
 one thing is impossible and today we do 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.320
 another game from the same house 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.600
 producer 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.810
 we hope it is equally impossible 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.369
 on the contrary we hope it is easier but not 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.619
 I think he said this left in flight 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.449
 pollicione on let's see if we overcome i 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.969
 a thousand for the next video and let's get started 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.550
 immediately then I would say starting from 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.730
 normal mode 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:42.149
 we begin to a perfect premise that 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:45.329
 It was absolutely my first game 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:48.090
 imperia where to avoid these spikes on 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:52.350
 problem arises from the fact that there are two 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:56.520
 simultaneously screens ok I have to 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:01:00.870
 admit that it is more difficult than maiden 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:09.229
 jump because you don't understand one here 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:13.189
 mace because you kind of fucking invert then 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:16.650
 I have to split my brain 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:20.130
 perfect no kat I didn't see it anyway 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:24.409
 21 we don't complain from you can get there 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:28.040
 even at 30 wishing oh fuck 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:33.650
 cabbage means I don't know how the hell I am 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:38.820
 going perfect perfect perfect 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:40.320
 ok ok a horn 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.350
 fuck I miss only six points for 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.740
 get to 30 well we can 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.740
 do 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:52.920
 ok ok i'm fucking 33 perfect we have 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.190
 exceeded the score I had 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.900
 set so it can go ok 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.509
 let's start with the nightmare mode 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.940
 remember a make the jump you came 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.190
 up to the hell difficulty now there is 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:09.570
 also impossible not to imagine 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:11.850
 what awaits me but I have a lot 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:16.500
 fear so let's go with nightmares i 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:18.540
 three mistake schemes go slower I know 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.730
 which is a little slower but is 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:29.540
 however impossible 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:29.540
 yes ok i'm taking the hand it is or shit 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.980
 16 points are made even faster 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:37.410
 busi because here is the type tripled 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.110
 but what arrives at some point that the 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:44.060
 your brain can no longer reason 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:47.190
 and you don't understand quality you have to move 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:52.440
 ok is exceeding the score of before 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:54.930
 ah fuck 22 let's move the blue color one 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:59.579
 green red with the development lo 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:01.230
 green the red one fucking will be there for 4 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:05.420
 damn points 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:09.030
 at this point I would say to try the 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:11.850
 let's see what awaits us closed four 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.860
 at the same time I'll never make it 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:18.090
 even if it goes even more methods before in 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:21.220
 therefore it is feasible as a thing 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.870
 I had n't seen the fuck then I am 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:27.730
 arrived at 13 which is not bad because 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:30.310
 summit of the jump I had only done to 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:33.910
 this 2 point mode is a stuff 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:38.830
 no, my brain is not in 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:41.650
 able to do such a thing 20 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:46.270
 points well I don't complain at this point 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:51.160
 let's go to hell and see what 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:54.040
 expect you know if i can do i 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.950
 ten points I'm happy it seems 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:00.310
 I don't think we can succeed 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:05.770
 no no it is fucking ie i can't 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:07.870
 frame this fucking situation ok 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:11.020
 we're fine we're okay this gotta 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:14.170
 even move this dick don't have 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:17.290
 saw the yellow 15 points ok better 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:19.270
 what i expected now is 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:22.740
 the time has come to do the 

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:27.070
 impossible difficulty we are ready 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:29.940
 321 psychological preparation gradually 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:32.050
 said ok perfect 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:35.050
 our RAIs will be able to do at least 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.330
 a point how the fuck did those points 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:40.930
 ok let's see if we can get to 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:43.900
 quota 10 I would be very happy 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.510
 too many breaks at the same time there 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.820
 you can succeed 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:53.280
 fuck three points like hell done to 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:58.270
 5 make a point and go worse 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:05:02.310
 zero points yes postive go down to minus 1 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:05.440
 I think I'm not really going to do it 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.289
 impossible I must be content with mine 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:11.080
 damage 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:14.479
 the five points I really think so 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:16.219
 yes yes guys so I would say that 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:18.379
 even for this video it can be everything 

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:21.339
 as you have also seen this game was 

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:23.629
 quite difficult indeed impossible 

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:25.369
 as usual, I invite you to leave a beautiful one 

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:27.020
 pollicione let's see if 

00:05:25.369 --> 00:05:28.879
 we reach the thousand for the next 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.919

00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:47.149
 brand new application episode 

00:05:45.709 --> 00:05:48.860
 strange ok 

00:05:47.149 --> 00:05:51.289
 I hadn't said this for years 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:53.659
 sentence no but really like the last one 

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:56.599
 episode I did was six or seven 

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:59.020
 months ago a stuff like that and then 

00:05:56.599 --> 00:05:59.020
 such as
