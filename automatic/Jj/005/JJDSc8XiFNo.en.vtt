00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
in front of what could arguably be

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.700 
in front of what could arguably be
called<00:02:11.490> the<00:02:12.030> world's<00:02:12.240> first<00:02:12.780> minivan<00:02:13.530> that's

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
called the world's first minivan that's

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.110 
called the world's first minivan that's
right<00:02:13.980> except<00:02:14.280> this<00:02:14.400> one<00:02:14.550> was<00:02:14.640> built<00:02:14.820> with<00:02:15.000> an

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
right except this one was built with an

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.570 
right except this one was built with an
aluminum<00:02:15.780> skin<00:02:16.050> new<00:02:16.560> attic<00:02:16.890> tubular<00:02:17.340> steel

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
aluminum skin new attic tubular steel

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.580 
aluminum skin new attic tubular steel
frame<00:02:17.940> oh<00:02:18.150> yeah<00:02:18.390> it<00:02:18.480> had<00:02:18.630> this<00:02:18.840> lace<00:02:19.200> wood

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
frame oh yeah it had this lace wood

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.040 
frame oh yeah it had this lace wood
interior<00:02:20.340> so<00:02:20.820> that<00:02:21.060> it<00:02:21.180> would<00:02:21.360> be<00:02:21.480> easier<00:02:21.960> to

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
interior so that it would be easier to

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.690 
interior so that it would be easier to
clean<00:02:22.500> that's<00:02:22.860> right<00:02:23.130> and<00:02:23.250> remember<00:02:23.520> how<00:02:23.640> we

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
clean that's right and remember how we

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.340 
clean that's right and remember how we
mentioned<00:02:23.910> that<00:02:24.090> it<00:02:24.210> had<00:02:24.300> a<00:02:24.330> rear<00:02:24.540> engine<00:02:24.690> well

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
mentioned that it had a rear engine well

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:26.660 
mentioned that it had a rear engine well
that's<00:02:25.530> so<00:02:25.650> there<00:02:25.860> was<00:02:25.950> plenty<00:02:26.130> of<00:02:26.340> room<00:02:26.550> up

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
that's so there was plenty of room up

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.720 
that's so there was plenty of room up
front<00:02:26.880> here<00:02:27.180> for<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:27.420> driver<00:02:27.660> and<00:02:27.960> as<00:02:28.830> odd<00:02:29.280> as

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
front here for the driver and as odd as

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.750 
front here for the driver and as odd as
the<00:02:30.030> scarab<00:02:30.540> may<00:02:30.840> seem<00:02:31.290> today<00:02:31.650> we<00:02:32.460> have<00:02:32.610> to

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
the scarab may seem today we have to

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.480 
the scarab may seem today we have to
remember<00:02:33.000> that<00:02:33.330> a<00:02:33.510> bunch<00:02:34.290> of<00:02:34.410> the<00:02:34.740> features<00:02:35.250> in

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
remember that a bunch of the features in

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.820 
remember that a bunch of the features in
this<00:02:35.820> vehicle<00:02:35.880> later<00:02:36.660> became<00:02:37.140> features<00:02:37.560> in

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
this vehicle later became features in

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.310 
this vehicle later became features in
production<00:02:38.610> car<00:02:38.820> yet<00:02:39.150> but<00:02:39.420> decades<00:02:39.780> later<00:02:39.960> as

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
production car yet but decades later as
