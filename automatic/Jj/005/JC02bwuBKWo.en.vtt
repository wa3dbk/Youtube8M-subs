00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:51.980
 cocoa with sugar 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:55.790
 in ours but this is all very small 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:04:01.040
 fire and achieve so to speak uniform 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:03.019
 slush uniform rusty babe us 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.760

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:29.169
 dissolved it turns out such here 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:29.169
 type of beetles, he gradually add it 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.780
 but the most interesting moment has come 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.530
 interesting point is 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.530
 kneading 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:03.740
 That's how it is dear viewers 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.449
 more or less homogeneous mass and now 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:09.190
 when it is more or less popular mass 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:09.190

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:29.760
 we form it as the base 

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:38.659
 I am very successful of course looks like 

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:40.839
 dog droppings when i'm not even doggy 

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:40.839
 litter 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:49.860
 that means forming a sausage 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.860
