00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.430
 a band I'm javier and this time 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:11.280
 I'm going to show you a video tutorial 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:11.280
 about how to make a smith 180 

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:20.480
 two basic things you have to have 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:22.310
 very dominated is the smith main and the 180 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.500
 Super perfect do not have to be 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.630
 mistakes and 22 tricks to be able 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:32.529
 finish the first thing they have to do 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:32.529
 to do 180 this afternoon 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.989
 almost where it ends to be able to start 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.920
 to practice one of the first steps 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.930
 what you have to do is record all well 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.570
 the back plant gets a little more 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:56.600
 normal to be able to reason what 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:58.879
 what can get us 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.579
 once you go to the end of the guard 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:03.920
 kashima determines what you're going to have to 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.990
 do is push your part of the back 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.259
 to one side at the moment they go 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.649
 sliding to slide you're starting to 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:11.649
 do this 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.610
 180 is not normal sowing function as 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.620
 practice floor aunts but this is 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.470
 a 180 that you're going to have to put a lot 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:25.930
 effort and when you do not have where you support 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:29.610
 front diet to be able to pay it here 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:33.299
 what you have to see is your strength 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.299
 it is the risk 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:41.110
 At the beginning what is going to happen is that 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:44.060
 I'm going to 90 degrees 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.280
 there are times you can not even cover 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.259
 but that's because the coins 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:52.009
 enough strength to get it out 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:54.710
 like what can happen to you since I left 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:57.440
 vÃ©lez milk you can fall in 90 even to 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.000
 a little less degrees this is because 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.850
 they do not give it enough strength to 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.799
 be able to push and if you do not feel this is 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.040
 issue of a lot of practice in patience 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:07.800
 more than anything 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.110
 as a tip that can give you a step 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.270
 make the boom and clear in your smith 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.960
 try to put a bit more part 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.280
 back a little more than normal 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.700
 this is given when they reach the end 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.250
 Ariel arrive with his back very 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.320
 put him to be able to pull 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.840
 another tip the power is that they practice it 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.380
 a truth that ends something like 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.360
 this is due to whom 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.150
 let's say the same has an end the beard is going 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:38.390
 to cost more work to get it out 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.250
 another tip that they have left is that their 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.290
 look always take her to the devil 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.930
 and where the beard ends, this is due to 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.420
 that when they go to pull do not neglect 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:50.870
 because that is going to cost them a lot since 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:53.209
 If you can pull them like that distance, 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.530
 can get out is something right but if you 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:03:00.280
 they pull here will not be useful 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:02.650
 since they have dominated at 1180 it is no longer going 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.709
 to be useful to practice a fence 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.630
 that has end that they put their gives 0 a 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:10.319
 little else this they will be able to do 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.319
 with you like 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.080
 love
