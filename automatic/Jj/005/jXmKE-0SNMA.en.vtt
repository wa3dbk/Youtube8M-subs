Z<00:01:44.280> on<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.790> track<00:01:45.000> listing<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.659> theme<00:01:45.930> was

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
Z on the track listing the theme was

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.950 
Z on the track listing the theme was
just<00:01:46.740> called<00:01:46.979> main<00:01:47.280> theme<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:48.570> wasn't<00:01:48.750> called

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
just called main theme and wasn't called

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.080 
just called main theme and wasn't called
rock<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.200> dragon<00:01:49.530> but<00:01:49.799> I<00:01:50.009> guess<00:01:50.220> that's<00:01:50.939> like

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
rock the dragon but I guess that's like

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.580 
rock the dragon but I guess that's like
one<00:01:51.329> of<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.479> only<00:01:51.570> things<00:01:51.810> that<00:01:51.960> is<00:01:52.170> said<00:01:52.380> in

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
one of the only things that is said in

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.980 
one of the only things that is said in
the<00:01:52.890> song<00:01:53.070> bus<00:01:53.670> fans<00:01:54.000> named<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.360> trucker<00:01:54.600> Dragon

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
the song bus fans named a trucker Dragon

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.690 
the song bus fans named a trucker Dragon
and<00:01:55.140> I<00:01:55.229> guess<00:01:55.439> it<00:01:55.619> just<00:01:55.649> became<00:01:56.130> official

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
and I guess it just became official

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.700 
and I guess it just became official
because<00:01:57.060> in<00:01:57.299> a<00:01:57.659> way<00:01:57.780> because<00:01:58.140> we<00:01:58.170> got<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.530> draw

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
because in a way because we got the draw

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.100 
because in a way because we got the draw
to<00:01:58.770> Dragon<00:01:59.219> box<00:01:59.549> set<00:01:59.790> and<00:01:59.939> Funimation<00:02:00.750> used<00:02:00.930> it

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
to Dragon box set and Funimation used it

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.679 
to Dragon box set and Funimation used it

really think about it it doesn't make
any<00:03:09.360> sense<00:03:09.630> really<00:03:09.930> because<00:03:10.500> that<00:03:10.769> song

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
any sense really because that song

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.180 
any sense really because that song
efficiently<00:03:12.209> was<00:03:12.329> released<00:03:12.569> in<00:03:12.660> 1996<00:03:13.319> likho

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
that time it wouldn't really make too

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.690 
that time it wouldn't really make too
much<00:03:22.109> sense<00:03:22.170> for<00:03:22.620> them<00:03:23.100> to<00:03:23.130> be<00:03:23.370> using<00:03:23.639> the

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:28.670 
a way because like a part in the song
and<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.630> time<00:03:27.810> they<00:03:27.900> weren't<00:03:28.049> no<00:03:28.410> one<00:03:28.530> like

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
and the time they weren't no one like

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.500 
and the time they weren't no one like
that<00:03:28.709> for<00:03:29.100> them<00:03:29.190> to<00:03:29.340> be<00:03:29.459> doing<00:03:29.670> that<00:03:29.970> in<00:03:30.269> order

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
that for them to be doing that in order

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:31.879 
that for them to be doing that in order
to<00:03:30.540> get<00:03:30.810> them<00:03:30.989> to<00:03:31.079> do<00:03:31.200> that<00:03:31.410> then<00:03:31.709> how<00:03:31.859> that

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:31.889 
to get them to do that then how that

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:33.740 
to get them to do that then how that
star<00:03:32.220> power<00:03:32.459> yet<00:03:32.700> that<00:03:32.910> kind<00:03:33.150> of<00:03:33.269> didn't<00:03:33.630> make

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
star power yet that kind of didn't make

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.140 
star power yet that kind of didn't make
sense<00:03:34.019> first<00:03:34.470> of<00:03:34.650> all<00:03:34.829> and<00:03:35.040> then<00:03:35.459> not<00:03:35.940> too<00:03:36.120> long

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
sense first of all and then not too long

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:41.870 
sense first of all and then not too long
later<00:03:36.540> think<00:03:36.930> 67<00:03:37.769> episodes<00:03:38.760> within<00:03:39.180> DBZ<00:03:40.880> that

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
later think 67 episodes within DBZ that

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.910 
later think 67 episodes within DBZ that
theme<00:03:42.420> song<00:03:42.450> wasn't<00:03:42.989> even<00:03:43.170> used<00:03:43.350> anymore<00:03:43.530> so

the newer people watching ABC didn't

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.430 
the newer people watching ABC didn't
really<00:03:47.970> know<00:03:48.359> about<00:03:48.690> that<00:03:48.989> theme<00:03:49.109> song<00:03:49.319> oh
