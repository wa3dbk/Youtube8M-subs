00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.920
 I hope you like it and let's start 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.840
 ok we have to have a site then 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:33.840
 we illia 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.570
 and we can see to handle 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.950
 and they are going to add the source that I am going 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.950
 to have 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:50.120
 all right 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.739
 he decides to love the suspension and then we go 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.739

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:06.250
 and they install it 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:06.250
 and we're going to do is enter minecraft 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.110
 and create a game 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:19.750
 for example this is diamond and gold that 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.590
 it would cost a lot 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.979

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:27.870

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:46.630

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.310

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.770
 creative even living can in fact 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:04.189

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.829
