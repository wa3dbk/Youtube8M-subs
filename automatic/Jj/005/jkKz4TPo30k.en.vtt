00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.060
 hello today I'm going to show you what things 

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:08.209
 We need to take care of our baby 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:10.610
 or our good doll the first thing about 

00:00:08.209 --> 00:00:12.799
 all a lot of love and also a lot 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.160
 patience but we also need 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:17.720
 different things that you have to buy 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.240
 because they are necessary to be able to take care 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.910
 to our wrist first thing for the 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.650
 diaper change I advise you 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.410
 use a size towel 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.330
 approximate to that of your wrist to 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.850
 I can knock it down every time you go to 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.880
 change the diaper, I have this 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:37.460
 you see is a little bit longer but more or 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.920
 less fits the size of it after 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:43.250
 logically we will need diapers 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:46.220
 You can buy the diapers clean or 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.610
 very special for dolls that are more 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:51.060
 expensive 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.910
 for children for real babies of the size 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.620
 newborn or premature those of 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.290
 premature babies are still a little bit more 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.740
 small therefore will adjust more 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:03.540
 to the size of your baby once you 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.760
 we have removed the dirty diaper 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.920
 we will have to remove the box or 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.740
 although only clean circulito 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.840
 have peed for it I advise you 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.420
 that you use wipes wipes 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.890
 wet how are you in this case are from 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.729
 the leading brand 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:24.330
 They are very cheap and smell very good 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:27.390
 after having cleaned the ass with 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.520
 the towel will have to be dried, take a 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.360
 small towel like this that I have 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:36.000
 here and rub it is carefully so that 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.390
 the skin is dry 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.360
 and finally we'll take a little 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.570
 this boat is creamed doll does not come out 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.460
 nothing but good you make the gesture that 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.210
 you are throwing the creampie with a 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.500
 masajito and finally he puts it on 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.420
 and it would already be changed 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.690
 therefore for the diaper change 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.460
 we repeat we would need one more towel 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.790
 or less than the size of the wrist a 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.740
 little bit bigger to be able to knock down the 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.080
 clean diapers wipes for 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.110
 clean them a tiny towel to 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:14.410
 dry it and cremita that is what 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:17.680
 I would need jce now let's see what 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:21.220
 you need to feed them first 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.950
 a bottle to give them milk 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.860
 you can also give him the water with the 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.860
 bottle or if not with a glass a small cup 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:33.670
 small like this that I have here for 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:35.920
 the pin a little dish with a teaspoon 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.680
 the porridge if you want you can save it 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.470
 in a few small tuppers me in this case 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.900
 I'm going to show you these two this from the 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.490
 Vaquita and this one of a doll that 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:49.040
 I bought at a bazaar shop 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:52.180
 in these stores that are worth 60 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:55.950
 cents good many things and you know 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:59.000
 They are very easy to open 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.880
 I keep the porridge here 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.470
 I close and that's it and there's no problem 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.260
 let it out 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.420
 so that the clothes do not get stained when 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.410
 you have to eat it you have to put it 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.750
 a bib 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:16.080
 and as always, a little bit of 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.770
 Face carefully dry the skin with 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.480
 a wet wipe you can use 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:23.970
 paper napkins but I advise you 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:27.030
 wet wipes because they are removed better 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.220
 the dirt later if you want to dry them 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.940
 you better take a handkerchief a handkerchief 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:35.100
 soft paper and ecais the good face 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.180
 Well, this would be what is needed to 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.940
 feed them 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:42.660
 a baby bottle 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:45.270
 a cup a little dish with a spoon 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:48.030
 mush you can save it in a 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:51.240
 tupper as I said or in a boat 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:54.180
 empty you have a nursery or forgiveness 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:58.160
 a bib so they do not get dirty and a 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:00.770
 wipe to clean the face 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:04.400
 now that we need more to take care of 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:07.010
 our baby, well, a pacifier like 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:10.780
 this one that I have here and so that it does not 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:13.040
 lose with a subject pacifiers that 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.290
 they hit the clothes and so there's no 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.380
 problem of losing too 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:21.320
 we need toys like this 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:25.730
 star rattle or this 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:28.270
 little sheep that is very cute for the little cradle 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.849
 what else is needed logically 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.429
 rock 

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:35.729
 broken as for example this one that I have 

00:04:32.429 --> 00:04:38.610
 here dresses shorts 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:42.899
 long depends on the time at which 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:44.969
 we are socks, socks, bodies, 

00:04:42.899 --> 00:04:49.240
 bodies that is very good for our 

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:51.870
 babies like this she has on 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.970
 and so a little bit of everything 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.710
 clothes that are enough to be able 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:58.470
 change it and that is always 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:01.760
 warm when it's cold and it does not pass 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:05.820
 too hot when it gets too hot 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:08.190
 and well then it would also be needed 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:11.220
 a stroller to give a ride a 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:14.370
 crib for a bathtub to sleep 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:17.940
 able to bathe it with a mild shampoo 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:19.960
 special for children a blanket so that 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.980
 do not pass cold 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.780
 what do I have here 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:27.360
 who puts it in the cradle 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.330
 and the doll does not go cold is fine 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.160
 warm 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:34.280
 so that 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:36.560
 these little things and good for now 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.330
 I do not remember more but above all a lot 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.420
 honey and that's it 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.420
 bye
