Lobby<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:41.340> basically<00:00:41.820> minimize<00:00:42.330> the

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:42.630 
Lobby to basically minimize the

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.600

but I can still get kicked out in the

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:54.160 
but I can still get kicked out in the
single-player<00:00:47.070> Lobby<00:00:47.400> I<00:00:47.730> don't<00:00:48.330> like<00:00:48.810> that
