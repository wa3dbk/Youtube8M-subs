00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:19.130
 and there mosquitoes, everything is right here 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:21.170
 speaking is the virus welcome but the 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.849
 hd video here on my channel galera and today 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.640
 I'm here to tell you something 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:27.830
 You're right, this video is a 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.470
 video a bit more informative not 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.240
 I want to report you there on one thing. 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.160
 I've seen enough people lately. 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:37.160
 ask me in the video comments on 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.629
 twitter and itself and even on the servers 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.539
 so I want to leave here clear 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:44.270
 everyone and explain is what what I 

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:45.890
 I know about this, and maybe I can 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.719
 improve a little for you a video 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.760
 too long a video a little fast 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:50.930
 But it's just to tell you about it. 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.910
 alright good guys 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.320
 you may have noticed that mvp gave a 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.989
 changed recently, right? 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.420
 and why is it good, this is something like this 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.789
 I do not know why she changed me. 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.890
 I learned and the king 's ox is that 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:06.440
 I think it 's one of the managers at ibm 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.030
 sp had this idea I do not know if it was just him 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.820
 and e quiquiqui etc. 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.890
 for which the whole staff had this 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.660
 idea of moving and thought it to 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.850
 I do not know if I can improve anyone else. 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.770
 that we are br maybe may have improved 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.960
 To go to them, I do not know if it was for us. 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.150
 but anyway I just wanted to say the 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.820
 you what is next now - and black 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.560
 divided into two servers is mvp in 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.880
 part of hunger games right now 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.690
 divided into two servers 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.130
 the other games that pvp you acf these 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.080
 things and I think it's still the same 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.150
 but here it's not gay but that's where 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.310
 I play neither I know it is divided into 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.870
 two ipÃªs the following is the prize the 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.880
 first and pixi may be playing here 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.560
 and hence I am that is onus opta 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.150
 Some people do not have soup with 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.440
 Its name says there though you can 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.850
 be using all that 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.130
 usually lets you put a kit here 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.890
 Here's how it works for you. 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.530
 only the soup does not work that it serves 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.570
 to eat and you may notice that the 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.390
 The rain squeezes a little more 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.490
 lakes etc. has dangerous then no 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.490
 I know if you remember there is a time 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.440
 that ex bbb put hg phoenix right I do not 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.240
 I know if hg phoenix still existed but I 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.740
 I think they have now verified and 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.819
 put these people know that 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.939
 basically 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.530
 already the hg phoenix, I do not think I have 

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:20.239
 wrong about something and if they can 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.129
 comment below will always be good to 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:24.260

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:27.019
 know more about this from yoki to our 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.819
 joy and hg then it's not over and I think 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:30.500

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.209
