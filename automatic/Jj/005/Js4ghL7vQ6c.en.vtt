00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
dining so just the quick tour a little

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.889 
dining so just the quick tour a little
bit<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.170> kitchen<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:53.420> down<00:00:54.420> below<00:00:54.600> there's

bit of a kitchen and down below there's

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.770 
bit of a kitchen and down below there's
just<00:00:55.350> volumes<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.250> storage<00:00:56.699> there<00:00:57.300> are<00:00:57.539> no

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
just volumes of storage there are no

just volumes of storage there are no
drawers<00:00:58.170> as<00:00:58.469> part<00:00:59.219> of<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.609> idea<00:01:00.149> this<00:01:00.300> boat<00:01:00.510> is

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
drawers as part of the idea this boat is

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.880 
drawers as part of the idea this boat is
that<00:01:00.870> it's<00:01:01.050> watertight<00:01:02.359> so<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.870> it's<00:01:04.500> divided

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
that it's watertight so and it's divided

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.340 
that it's watertight so and it's divided
into<00:01:05.189> safe<00:01:05.549> sections<00:01:06.299> where<00:01:06.689> if<00:01:06.960> water<00:01:07.200> does

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
into safe sections where if water does

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.010 
into safe sections where if water does
if<00:01:08.189> we<00:01:08.369> do<00:01:08.460> have<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.670> puncture<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.720> water<00:01:09.900> is

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
if we do have a puncture the water is

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.820 
if we do have a puncture the water is
isolated<00:01:10.619> so<00:01:10.830> that's<00:01:11.400> why<00:01:11.580> there's<00:01:12.110> the<00:01:13.110> frame

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
isolated so that's why there's the frame

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.429 
isolated so that's why there's the frame
walls<00:01:14.130> up<00:01:14.490> 16<00:01:15.090> inches<00:01:15.450> so<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:16.080> boat<00:01:16.290> is

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
walls up 16 inches so the boat is

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.450 
walls up 16 inches so the boat is
divided<00:01:16.860> into<00:01:17.040> three<00:01:17.400> distinct<00:01:17.880> hulls<00:01:18.420> and

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
divided into three distinct hulls and

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.260 
divided into three distinct hulls and
the<00:01:20.460> washroom<00:01:20.939> oops

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
the washroom oops

composting toilet we had a port-a-potty

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.200 
composting toilet we had a port-a-potty
but<00:01:28.710> frankly<00:01:29.070> didn't<00:01:29.280> like<00:01:29.430> it<00:01:29.640> this<00:01:29.880> is<00:01:30.060> also

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
but frankly didn't like it this is also

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
potti did push well out of the way so it

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.450 
potti did push well out of the way so it
it's<00:01:40.140> not<00:01:40.320> in<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.590> way<00:01:40.680> you<00:01:40.740> can<00:01:40.890> use<00:01:41.130> that<00:01:41.310> as

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
it's not in the way you can use that as

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.100 
it's not in the way you can use that as
a<00:01:41.490> change<00:01:41.820> room<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:42.420> just<00:01:42.450> slide<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:43.020> out
