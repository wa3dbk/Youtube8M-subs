00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 Hi, I think everything is done if you see me and 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.940
 As you can see we are in sky words and we are going to 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.639
 see what we found here a little 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.170
 of food fish arrows a good rod 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.780
 they are not too good things to me 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.099
 take the peak here and I have a diamond 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.680
 Well anyway I do not know what I'm going to do with 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:20.310
 a diamond and this from here normal a 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.080

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.949
 at that moment as is the sound of 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.990
 music bar moment we have it all 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.099
 well in order to see what else there is here 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.980

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:36.280

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:39.550
 I do not really know where things are or 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.800
 what to do around here so that there 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.980

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.610

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:53.480
 zille 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:55.340
 if I give it first and it worries me a lot 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.129
 so let's take advantage let's do 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:01.880

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:05.220

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:07.080

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.360

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:13.410

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.670

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:26.860
 Take out the baby here I'm sure 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.480

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.620
 had happened with him must have 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:34.350
 dead because this has fallen or a sword 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:37.320

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.820
 failure is that voucher and here I have 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.680

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:12.730

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.150
 looted 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:25.040
 I do not really know where to go listening 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:28.540
 all the time people die to see 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.540
 I play the game 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:35.440

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.960

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.120

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:43.240
 watch 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.770
 I would need a casket which I do not know 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.580
 if maybe there are around here there 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.580
 writing people 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:03:00.150
 has seen 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.150
 the same 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.890
 there were seven players left 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:11.209
 but today I do not know where they were who bad 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.090
 lucky if I think I was about to 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:16.879
 to die almost almost dies anyway guys 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.640
 this has been the first experience in 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:20.090
 the sky words in the program was not 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.000
 wrong 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.230
 I thought it was entertaining what 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.700
 it happens that as he still did not know me 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.639
 all things and others look out here 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.719
 was this end I had almost no armed nor 

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:32.269
 nothing but good I have done what I have 

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:34.639
 could and I think that having killed two 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:36.079
 have been one with the eggs is more than 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:36.680
 enough so good guys I hope 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:38.689
 what you liked 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.189
 if it's like that from the favorites and we 

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:43.090

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:43.090
