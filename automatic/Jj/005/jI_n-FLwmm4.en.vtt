00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:08.160
 today I will show you a fresh make-up that 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.080
 recalls and the first days of 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.349
 spring eye makeup is 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.910
 characterized by golden reflections 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:17.250
 within cool colors that therefore 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.020
 they create shades of color together 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.320
 very refined that they were living there 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.390
 look then a colored makeup that 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.279
 plays with reflections of color but that 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.930
 it remains the same candid time 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.679
 then I already applied a foundation 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.910
 to uniform and illuminate the complexion 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:34.440
 now I begin to touch the eye 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.420
 applying a transparent primer on 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:41.460
 the whole eyelid is practically used 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.809
 dry the eyelid and avoid the 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.059
 spill of that oily substance 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.620
 which melts make-up and makeup 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.320
 it will last much much longer 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.480
 now I apply dreamer on the whole 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.739
 eyelid and stand with a brush 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.750
 soft 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.750
 this is part of the bright so a 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.940
 arm and very high pigmentation that 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.640
 allow you to get an effect 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.710
 very full when applied with a brush 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.530
 flat or with fingers or one 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.170
 very delicate shade with a brush 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.299
 soft like this here is a color 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.060
 very special because it is a cold phase 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.220
 silver gray with these reflections 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.509
 very gently browned the estimate 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.350
 even inside the fold 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:27.689
 I wear the same color of the eye 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:29.490
 also in the lower eyelid after having 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.409
 having created this super shade 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.369
 bright all over the eye I take a 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.100
 other color 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:38.040
 I apply atmosphere that this green 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.670
 water always in cold base with gods 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.399
 golden reflections and I apply it inside 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:48.060
 of the eye to create a kind of 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:51.509
 light point but a little more particular a 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.869
 color that refreshes the eye very much 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:57.420
 because it immediately gives us a touch of 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:02:01.469
 brightness particularity to the look also 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:04.020
 atmosfair is part of the bright and therefore 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:06.510
 with the soft brush allows him to 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.570
 create a slight shade of color 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:11.010
 very delicate and very elegant now 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.920
 I want to give more depth to the look 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:16.860
 so instead of using a color 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:22.110
 classic beige brownish type I choose 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:25.320
 aphrodite a warm color that will create more 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.150
 depth but also contrast with these 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:32.130
 two cool colors because this is a 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:34.560
 very warm tone a coppery coral color 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:37.770
 is always with the same brush I do not go 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.330
 to change it I'm going to apply it with 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.700
 circular movements within the 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:45.210
 fold as a pencil I apply golden age 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.310
 this closes the pencil that has a soul 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:49.020
 very very soft when you are 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.360
 dries becomes completely opaque 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.580
 the particularity of this color and that 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.770
 it has a cold gray base however it is 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:59.900
 studded with gold micro glitter 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:03.150
 therefore they allow you to have an effect 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.650
 very very bright and it is also 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.209
 a great alternative to the black pencil 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.340
 when you want to get effects a 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.290
 the more sophisticated the more discreet the 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:14.720
 same pencil as the sponge 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:18.480
 outside creating a sort of hill 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:22.350
 and then before it dries up I go to 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:26.010
 blend with a soft brush for 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:28.019
 I would love to have this look 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.630
 more nuanced lines no line too much 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:32.940
 defined this pencil a very life 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.620
 soft and therefore allows me to create 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.019
 different types of looks 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.060
 you can for example have a super line 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:42.140
 defined or precisely because it is a lot 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:45.690
 soft you can fade and has a tightness 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:47.940
 extreme I apply with the venice also to the 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.440
 lower eyelash base 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.550
 this one having some micro glitter is not 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.300
 can apply inside the eye 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.860
 however the black velvet line absolutely 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.540
 if to increase the play of reflexes 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.470
 they want to help outside the eye 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:04.590
 interference closes this is an eye shadow 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:09.680
 semi 2 com has a gray twisted base 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.680
 very cold with a mauve reflection 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:16.600
 I extend it from the outer corner 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:19.049
 inside the fold and also in the 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.049
 bottom 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:29.090
 how illuminating I apply atom this is 

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:33.409
 a satÃ¨n that differently from 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:36.860
 bright eye shadow is a bit more delicate one 

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:40.909
 the obligation to illuminate is somewhat lighter 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:44.930
 the arcade slightly eyebrows 

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:50.449
 inside the eye I apply it 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:52.669
 just above atmosphere and this is one 

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:54.590
 neutral base so it looks good on all 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:05:01.039
 interned to better define the look 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:05:06.080
 I apply stretching mascara now 

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:07.610
 I apply the aforementioned board 1.0 I wanted 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.949
 a specific checker for the check 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:12.440
 of the eye and then realized this 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:13.699
 here it allows you to illuminate correct 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.219
 perfectly the eye why 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:18.620
 inside a warm orange undertone 

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:22.190
 hence contrasts the purple blue 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:24.650
 of eyeglasses and very little lapo is enough 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:29.060
 durable dining fixes well and lasts 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:31.849
 very much and the effect is extremely 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:33.590
 curious and very very natural before 

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:35.599
 fix the base I apply a blush in 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:38.509
 cream and for this look and I choose the 

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:40.219
 liquid tech blush in fluids love the 

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:42.050
 liquid techs all have a formula a 

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:44.659
 water based so they are very light 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:49.889
 easy to blend fluid love is a color 

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:52.949
 very fresh that has a coral base 

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:55.110
 and allows you to instantly give a 

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:57.960
 health effect on your face 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:00.330
 usually cream blushes result 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:02.939
 very difficult to use and often 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:04.860
 these are too pigmented here 

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:06.900
 eh a really very easy formula to 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:09.389
 use an adjustable opacity yes 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:12.090
 they can also apply this way 

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:14.210
 make two strokes on the face and then stretch out 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:18.150
 directly with your fingers 

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:21.659
 well super easy to handle as a point 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:23.159
 light I use the h2o christine e 

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:24.689
 these are eye shadows of the formula 

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:25.979
 truly innovative 

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:30.270
 I apply it directly with my fingers 

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:31.800
 because it looks almost like cream then 

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:35.219
 the application improves I go to 

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:36.569
 press the pigment on the skin 

00:06:35.219 --> 00:06:39.569
 obviously you can also use it as 

00:06:36.569 --> 00:06:42.089
 illuminating I wanted a neutral color that 

00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:44.580
 indeed it was multi-purpose then 

00:06:42.089 --> 00:06:46.319
 usable both as a sutra eye shadow 

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:48.060
 eyelid or as a light point 

00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:49.979
 on the eyebrow arch inside 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:53.279
 of the eye or note on the cheekbone e 

00:06:49.979 --> 00:06:54.900
 on areas to light up the face for 

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:57.150
 complete the base I am going to apply a 

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:59.159
 veil of illuminating powder and insists 

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:01.529
 especially in the central part of the 

00:06:59.159 --> 00:07:03.240
 face because I want to keep it anyway 

00:07:01.529 --> 00:07:05.189
 a certain brightness on everything else 

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:07.289
 of the skin to complete this look 

00:07:05.189 --> 00:07:09.839
 so fresh and bright I'm going to apply 

00:07:07.289 --> 00:07:18.629
 a gloss this is light net in shine of 

00:07:09.839 --> 00:07:23.310
 gloss in kyoto is a bit of a news hue 

00:07:18.629 --> 00:07:25.770
 more rosy suitable to revive any 

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:28.470
 look 

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:31.500
 and this is a fantastic product because 

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:34.110
 is a concentrate of precious oils that 

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:37.370
 live your lips a long time and stay 

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:39.330
 super comfortable all day long 

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:41.159
 this is a product I recommend 

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:44.960
 also use daily as if 

00:07:41.159 --> 00:07:47.250
 it was a moisturizing balm because 

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:51.110
 keeps it respects the right hydration 

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:51.110
 of the finished lips
