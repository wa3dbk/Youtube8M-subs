 and 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.009
 now 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:15.279
 so how about youtube friends here 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:18.520
 Nestor bringing them a video of how 

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:20.259
 release ram memory on windows 7 and 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:24.160
 so as not to make the video so long 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:26.380
 let's start, let's start and click on 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.469
 control panel after to system and 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:32.790
 security and we click on see the 

00:00:29.469 --> 00:00:32.790
 amount of ram memory 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.730
 now we will go to the side window 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.680
 left of the screen and we give another 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.320
 click on advanced configuration of 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.770

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:48.320
 this window will appear we are going to 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.120
 advanced options and we're going to 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.150
 performance and click on 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:56.629
 configuration will come up another window and 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:59.449
 again we go to advanced options and 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:01.870
 there they mark the option of programs and in 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:04.360
 virtual memory they give in changing 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:07.450
 des tick the selected box and go 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:10.810
 to custom size and size 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:13.960
 initial they put 2000 and in maximum size 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:16.060
 they put 4000 they give to establish and they 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.750
 a warning will come out that they have to restart 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.750
 and restart 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.950
 good and after doing what you 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:27.070
 We said previously opened scraps 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.070
 notes 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:37.180
 and we wrote my spring equal sign 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:41.110
 we open parentheses 80,000,000 we close 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:44.229
 parentheses we go to click file 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.630
 in save as and we select where 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.820
 we want to save in my case I recommend 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.210
 that on the desk since it is 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.210
 easy 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.280
 we put the name we want but at 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:01.450
 end of the title they chose lay 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:05.700
 vrbs point 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.700
 and already done that we give to save 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:13.060
 now we go to the archive and we give 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.130
 double click but as you can see it does not open for 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.650
 know if it works we go to the bar 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.890
 tasks we click right click on 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.140
 start the task manager will 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.500
 they go to performance and as you see the use of 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:30.280
 cpu has dropped as with memory 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:32.770
 ram I hope I have helped you and thank you
