00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.380
 no 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.090
 much desire for all the guys here at 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.430
 giuseppe welcome to this new video 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.080
 by assassin's creed 4 black flag in which 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.790
 I will show you how to capture different 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.140
 sea ​​creatures since even gods 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:26.180
 tips that can help them 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.830
 in the company the possibility of smoothing out 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.690
 sea ​​creatures will be available 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.130
 from sequence 3 consists of a phase of 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.750
 game where we have to hit several times 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.879
 the enemy to fall under the blows 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.350
 a piece of advice from our harpoon 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:38.360
 I can give you a priori and that the process 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.650
 of aging will be easier if you have 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.239
 purchased upgrades from 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.040
 harbourmaster general store that sells 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:44.840
 upgrades for your ship 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.180
 and that you can find in different places 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.010
 like salt that the biggest to buy 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.659
 I am the armor for the rowboat that 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.400
 will allow you to have a boat more 

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:53.809
 resistant to force attacks 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.280
 of the action that ensures damage 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:57.229
 greater when hitting prey e 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.150
 deposit of harpoons thanks to which you can 

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:01.309
 have more harpoons available during 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.379
 the hunting process we now turn to 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:04.760
 sea ​​creatures will appear on the map 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:06.470
 and they will never have a fixed position 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.040
 in case there are none on 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.299
 map 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.310
 take a trip to different islands 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:11.900
 one should appear during mine 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.610
 I travel with the jack do I came across 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.890
 for the first time with a leuca shark 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.450
 defeat it was not hard to believe 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.100
 in fact if one of the simplest preys 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.450
 to capture his movement was 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.130
 rather predictable so it was 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.130
 You can hit it without major problems 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.460
 the second sea creature that 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:29.899
 met the hammerhead fish a 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.579
 Unlike the Leo shark I have 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:33.469
 noticed that they move so little 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:35.270
 predictable and consequently capture 

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:36.829
 it was more complicated though slightly 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.539
 when the creature is tenacious as in 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:39.979
 this case could get rid of 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:41.509
 taking of the actions with which it precisely 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.009
 we hit him he'll try to attack 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:44.390
 our rowboat that could 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:50.780
 give in to the blows if not properly 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:52.549
 enhanced shark capture of 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.560
 other creatures will get us different 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:56.600
 objects like skin useful bones for the 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.039
 manufacture of clothes for edward in 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.689
 In this case we are manufacturing the 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:01.219
 dressed as a shark hunter who does not 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:04.210
 it's particular influences on the game is 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:04.210
 purely aesthetic 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.630
 a controlled creature difficult to 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.950
 beat was lorca often avoided i 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.570
 my breakfast attacks and those times 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.220
 where I could hit it freed 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:18.060
 after a while and then upload to mine 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.260
 ship trying to destroy it later 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.210
 a not easy refinement process 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.250
 have managed to defeat lorca a 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.960
 thus unlock the goal trophy friend 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.700
 of nature that consists precisely in the 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.470
 flat king an orca left the discovery 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.060
 of the other marine creatures you know 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.560
 only that there are really huge ones 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.740
 in that case the difficulty of my game 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.300
 the video will be much taller 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.980
 concludes here I hope you enjoyed it and 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.510
