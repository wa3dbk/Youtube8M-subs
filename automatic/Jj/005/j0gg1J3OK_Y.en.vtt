so<00:00:37.400> obviously<00:00:37.879> it's<00:00:38.090> looking<00:00:38.300> to<00:00:38.390> feel<00:00:38.540> a

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
so obviously it's looking to feel a

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.470 
so obviously it's looking to feel a
little<00:00:38.750> different<00:00:39.170> niche<00:00:39.350> then<00:00:40.280> the<00:00:41.000> Lakota

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
little different niche then the Lakota

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.000 
little different niche then the Lakota
so<00:00:41.960> it<00:00:42.110> does<00:00:42.260> have<00:00:42.410> some<00:00:42.440> different<00:00:42.890> features

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
so it does have some different features

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.280 
so it does have some different features
and<00:00:43.489> things<00:00:44.390> like<00:00:44.629> that<00:00:45.339> so<00:00:46.420> price<00:00:47.420> unsure<00:00:48.260> on

it's<00:02:01.970> not<00:02:02.180> quite<00:02:02.510> too<00:02:03.020> easy

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
it's not quite too easy

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.250 
it's not quite too easy
bond<00:02:04.729> holes<00:02:05.090> and<00:02:05.210> the<00:02:05.270> vapor<00:02:05.450> are<00:02:05.690> huge<00:02:05.990> and

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
bond holes and the vapor are huge and

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.169 
bond holes and the vapor are huge and
should<00:02:06.890> lend<00:02:07.040> themselves<00:02:07.340> easy<00:02:07.549> leathers<00:02:08.000> as

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
should lend themselves easy leathers as

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.580 
should lend themselves easy leathers as
well<00:02:08.509> as<00:02:08.750> the<00:02:09.470> top<00:02:10.039> string<00:02:10.310> holes<00:02:10.629> so<00:02:11.629> they<00:02:12.379> did

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
well as the top string holes so they did

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.180 
well as the top string holes so they did
increase<00:02:12.860> those<00:02:13.159> a<00:02:13.190> little<00:02:13.549> bit<00:02:15.190> certainly

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
increase those a little bit certainly

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.039 
increase those a little bit certainly
not<00:02:16.400> you<00:02:16.730> know<00:02:16.819> nothing<00:02:17.390> against<00:02:17.599> the<00:02:17.720> Lakota

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:18.049 
not you know nothing against the Lakota

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:21.040 
not you know nothing against the Lakota
but<00:02:18.670> stringing<00:02:19.670> I<00:02:19.819> would<00:02:19.970> actually<00:02:20.480> pick<00:02:20.720> the

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
but stringing I would actually pick the

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.840 
but stringing I would actually pick the
vapor

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
vapor

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.240 
vapor
for<00:02:23.390> everything<00:02:23.720> except<00:02:24.170> for<00:02:24.320> maybe<00:02:24.470> a<00:02:24.590> really

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
for everything except for maybe a really

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.710 
for everything except for maybe a really
high<00:02:25.400> pocket<00:02:25.850> since<00:02:26.060> the<00:02:26.180> pinch<00:02:26.360> is<00:02:26.480> a<00:02:26.510> little

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
high pocket since the pinch is a little

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.110 
high pocket since the pinch is a little
less<00:02:26.870> severe<00:02:27.260> but<00:02:27.290> it<00:02:27.410> took<00:02:27.650> the<00:02:28.490> mid<00:02:28.700> pocket

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
less severe but it took the mid pocket

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.370 
less severe but it took the mid pocket
just<00:02:29.420> about<00:02:29.750> perfectly<00:02:31.510> so<00:02:32.510> that<00:02:32.960> brings<00:02:33.170> us

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
just about perfectly so that brings us

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.230 
just about perfectly so that brings us
into<00:02:33.530> face<00:02:33.830> shape<00:02:34.130> you<00:02:34.490> can<00:02:34.640> see<00:02:34.850> the<00:02:35.000> face

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
into face shape you can see the face

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.940 
into face shape you can see the face
shape<00:02:35.510> of<00:02:36.380> the<00:02:37.130> vapor<00:02:37.460> is<00:02:37.790> just<00:02:38.060> a<00:02:38.180> little<00:02:38.570> less

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
shape of the vapor is just a little less

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.930 
shape of the vapor is just a little less
a<00:02:40.540> little<00:02:41.540> less<00:02:41.630> aggressive<00:02:41.990> a<00:02:42.760> little<00:02:43.760> less

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
a little less aggressive a little less

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.900 
a little less aggressive a little less
pinched<00:02:44.480> up<00:02:44.600> through<00:02:44.990> the<00:02:45.110> middle<00:02:45.320> area<00:02:45.910> both

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
pinched up through the middle area both

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.570 
pinched up through the middle area both
high<00:02:47.120> school<00:02:47.390> heads<00:02:47.800> so<00:02:48.800> I<00:02:48.830> like<00:02:49.280> a<00:02:49.310> really

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
high school heads so I like a really

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.280 
high school heads so I like a really
pitched<00:02:49.820> head<00:02:50.090> so<00:02:50.390> in<00:02:50.510> that<00:02:50.630> case<00:02:50.930> I'm<00:02:51.140> going

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
pitched head so in that case I'm going

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
pitched head so in that case I'm going
to<00:02:51.350> take<00:02:51.470> from<00:02:51.530> the<00:02:51.680> coat<00:02:51.860> it<00:02:52.010> helps<00:02:52.220> just

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
to take from the coat it helps just

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.980 
to take from the coat it helps just
ringing<00:02:52.610> high<00:02:52.970> pocket<00:02:53.300> easier<00:02:53.630> with<00:02:53.840> that

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
ringing high pocket easier with that

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.740 
ringing high pocket easier with that
pinch<00:02:54.290> a<00:02:54.500> little<00:02:54.739> bit<00:02:54.890> higher<00:02:55.390> this<00:02:56.390> has<00:02:56.600> more

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
pinch a little bit higher this has more

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.620 
pinch a little bit higher this has more
of<00:02:56.810> an<00:02:56.900> Evo<00:02:57.200> three<00:02:57.730> face<00:02:58.730> shapes<00:02:59.030> on<00:02:59.270> which<00:02:59.480> me

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
of an Evo three face shapes on which me

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.560 
of an Evo three face shapes on which me
Italian<00:03:00.140> and<00:03:00.290> Eva<00:03:00.470> three<00:03:01.060> more<00:03:02.060> narrow<00:03:02.300> than

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
Italian and Eva three more narrow than

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:03.880 
Italian and Eva three more narrow than
the<00:03:02.630> Eagle<00:03:02.930> eggs<00:03:03.050> of<00:03:03.260> course<00:03:03.470> since<00:03:03.680> it's<00:03:03.800> a

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
the Eagle eggs of course since it's a

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.660 
the Eagle eggs of course since it's a
high<00:03:04.010> school<00:03:04.280> head<00:03:05.080> and<00:03:06.280> but<00:03:07.280> I'd<00:03:07.459> like<00:03:07.580> to

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
high school head and but I'd like to

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.010 
high school head and but I'd like to
really<00:03:07.820> like<00:03:08.030> the<00:03:08.150> look<00:03:08.360> of<00:03:08.450> both<00:03:08.600> these<00:03:08.780> heads

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
really like the look of both these heads

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.370 
really like the look of both these heads
the<00:03:09.980> sidewall<00:03:10.570> pattern<00:03:11.570> on<00:03:11.840> them<00:03:12.050> are<00:03:12.170> both

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
the sidewall pattern on them are both

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.120 
the sidewall pattern on them are both
really<00:03:12.709> aggressive<00:03:14.110> you<00:03:15.110> know<00:03:15.140> you<00:03:15.800> can<00:03:15.950> see

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
really aggressive you know you can see

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:17.800 
really aggressive you know you can see
the<00:03:16.280> similarities<00:03:16.910> in<00:03:16.940> sidewall<00:03:17.420> pattern<00:03:17.690> if

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
the similarities in sidewall pattern if

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:18.990 
the similarities in sidewall pattern if
you<00:03:17.840> have<00:03:17.959> Homer<00:03:18.170> together<00:03:18.440> like<00:03:18.650> this

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
you have Homer together like this

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.080 
you have Homer together like this
because<00:03:20.000> the<00:03:20.480> vapor<00:03:21.470> has<00:03:21.860> the<00:03:22.040> same<00:03:22.310> sidewall

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
because the vapor has the same sidewall

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.440 
because the vapor has the same sidewall
pattern<00:03:23.420> except<00:03:23.930> kind<00:03:24.170> of<00:03:24.290> flipped<00:03:25.209> which<00:03:26.209> I

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
pattern except kind of flipped which I

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.090 
pattern except kind of flipped which I
am<00:03:26.810> Not<00:03:27.019> sure<00:03:27.049> they<00:03:27.410> moved<00:03:27.620> it<00:03:27.739> down<00:03:27.890> a<00:03:27.920> little

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
am Not sure they moved it down a little

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.310 
am Not sure they moved it down a little
bit<00:03:28.340> to<00:03:28.580> help<00:03:28.670> with<00:03:28.910> the<00:03:29.030> rigid<00:03:29.209> the<00:03:30.049> rigidity

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
bit to help with the rigid the rigidity

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.650 
bit to help with the rigid the rigidity
in<00:03:30.709> the<00:03:30.799> middle<00:03:30.980> of<00:03:31.070> the<00:03:31.130> head<00:03:31.510> in<00:03:32.510> the<00:03:32.540> middle

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
in the middle of the head in the middle

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.449 
in the middle of the head in the middle
of<00:03:32.840> the<00:03:32.900> head<00:03:33.100> whereas<00:03:34.100> this<00:03:34.190> would<00:03:34.310> be<00:03:34.430> a

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
of the head whereas this would be a

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:37.259 
of the head whereas this would be a
little<00:03:34.670> more<00:03:34.760> flexible<00:03:35.150> down<00:03:35.330> to<00:03:35.510> throat

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
little more flexible down to throat

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:41.140 
little more flexible down to throat
overall<00:03:38.269> I<00:03:38.540> think<00:03:39.290> that<00:03:39.650> I<00:03:39.680> would<00:03:40.070> pick<00:03:40.280> my<00:03:40.970> old

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
overall I think that I would pick my old

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.630 
overall I think that I would pick my old
standby<00:03:41.390> the<00:03:41.570> Lakota<00:03:42.049> just<00:03:42.860> because<00:03:43.160> of<00:03:43.430> the

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
standby the Lakota just because of the

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.270 
standby the Lakota just because of the
pinch<00:03:43.910> in<00:03:44.030> the<00:03:44.150> face<00:03:44.360> shape<00:03:44.799> but<00:03:45.799> if<00:03:45.920> you<00:03:46.070> like

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
pinch in the face shape but if you like

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.430 
pinch in the face shape but if you like
a<00:03:46.489> little<00:03:46.790> bit<00:03:46.910> wider<00:03:47.299> pinch<00:03:47.720> a<00:03:47.959> little<00:03:48.290> wider

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
a little bit wider pinch a little wider

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.780 
a little bit wider pinch a little wider
face<00:03:48.709> shape<00:03:48.950> and<00:03:49.070> something<00:03:49.340> that<00:03:49.430> strange<00:03:49.640> of

face shape and something that strange of

face shape and something that strange of
mid<00:03:49.910> pocket<00:03:50.269> really<00:03:50.390> nicely<00:03:50.630> the<00:03:51.620> vapor<00:03:51.860> maybe

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
mid pocket really nicely the vapor maybe

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.270 
mid pocket really nicely the vapor maybe
