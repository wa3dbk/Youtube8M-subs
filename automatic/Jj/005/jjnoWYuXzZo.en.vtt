00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.450
 hello very good to all vivid 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.879
 androids today we are going to perform the 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.789
 smart attitude to the sony xperia does everything 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:18.810
 stable as in version 4 the most 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:21.090
 recent 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.340
 here is it 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.200
 youtube application will 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.180
 perform the test as it says here is a 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.730
 previous score 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.500
 and we will give again 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.340
 the orientation of the 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.480
 screen 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.480
 to perform the test 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:44.280
 as well as there is progressing 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:47.250
 and at the end will perform all the tests 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.680
 they started to see here 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:54.750
 the tests in 2d and 3d 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.750
 and at the end will give us the score 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.500
 As you can see, he is subtracting the 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:16.780
 cpu performance 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.780
 Then it will go to another section 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:24.480
 to go through everything 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.480
 and adding the points of each section 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:30.970
 now a the final score which is the 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.970
 what we see in the result 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.880
 now he is testing multitasking 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:03.790
 As you can see, this process is quite slow 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.790
 since it takes a long time 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:15.620
 is now testing the storage in 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:18.850
 writing and reading and now as 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.850
 You see started with the 2d 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:29.069
 now another test also for the 2 d 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.379
 and now the one of the last tests 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:51.129
 is from 3d as it is here the 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:51.129
 information in fps and triangles 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:58.580
 for your faith here they go to 45 of half more or 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.190
 less sometimes they come down 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:04.210
 another goes up 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:08.280
 As you can see, it's pretty fast 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:08.280
 and the image looks quite fluid 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.470
 and not so in other devices more more 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.760
 slow and less powerful as is the 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.030
 final score has been a bit 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.900
 lower than the previous test that was 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:24.209
 of 33 thousand and something 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.170
 in this case it has been on the verge of 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.270
 get to 33 thousand 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.510
 as it is here the comparison with others 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:33.620
 devices in this case puts it by 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.319
 behind him xiaomi 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:39.350
 and power before g2 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:43.490
 and here are the following 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:47.960
 and here details will have all the 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:50.000
 device information in this case 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:52.640
 as you see the score separately from 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.920
 each section then makes the addition with very 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.800
 different 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.910
 and get the final result 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:03.140
 as you see here 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.140
 let's see now 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.610
 the characteristics of the device as 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.970
 you see 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:16.030
 these nine before here the information 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.970
 Of the device 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.430
 and here we will see the version of android 4.4 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:24.660
 Point 2 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:28.080
 the snapdragon 801 with a little solution 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:30.710
 more than full hd 1200 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.110
 I had 330 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.240
 the available storage space 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.380
 of 3 gigs of ram and so on all 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.810
 characteristics 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.350
 and here we can see the ranking as we have 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.350
 done before 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.300
 here 

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:49.500
 the top 20 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.500
 in this case here 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:56.790
 at the highest score of each 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.990
 device 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.990
 in this case here our 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:09.169
 and as you can see this has been the whole video 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.930
 to perform the attitude in a cove is 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:14.750
