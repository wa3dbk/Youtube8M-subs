00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:05.800
 It is a way for you and above all that 

00:00:03.129 --> 00:00:07.930
 these playoffs with Saturday here go 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:10.060
 with one more team to present me in two 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.740
 things things difficult comes break to a 

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.060
 important moment of more size and believes 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.769
 which is an important month they trained and 

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.910
 systems at the end they get it that 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:17.710
 it was an important moment here 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.440
 programmatic tantra believes it was 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.160
 delicate and I taste good I think it's not 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.250
 prepared 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.690
 today among the adversaries were those 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.500
 companions like that and after a while there is 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:31.109
 being the most important puts more in the 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.280
 habana partition is the same I think that 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.499
 until it's different they would not also be 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.289
 two parties but that still provides 

00:00:35.499 --> 00:00:39.670
 us from seeing from the 

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:41.139
 practice yes that is a each end not 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.300
 There are now three final days as if 

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:46.539
 he thinks that they are having that little bit 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.519
 here to the ejido here donated 100 present 

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:49.629
 the data to pass and for tomorrow not 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:51.549
 go to the champions 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:53.019
 we know it's going to be a tough match that 

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:55.839
 it's going to be a difficult game because the 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:57.989
 rival had little to lose a lot 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:00:57.989
 what to win 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.520
 I had a pretty good control of the game in 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.830
 the first part made it difficult for us 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.440
 pretty but good we've had 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.690
 our opportunities we have here 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.970
 we had the advantage also I thought 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.730
 with a balanced tie maybe 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.650
 because the leg could have 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:18.200
 come out with a more comfortable result but 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:21.230
 happily or the goal fulfilled 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:24.220
 well also worthy of the champions of 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:26.510
 quarterfinals in front we have a 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.060
 great team with very good 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.460
 players who have also known how to play 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.119
 his party but good at the end the 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:37.930
 objective fulfilled and we are in semis 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:37.930
 moments of the game 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:46.080
 a moment of a little imprecision of 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.930
 maybe a little lack of 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.270
 movement of the classmates good to 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.970
 sometimes they also pass the stress 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.910
 that these parties are coming the fact 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.000
 have to go to attack when you have a 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:02.130
 result that puts you the next round 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.410
 but we have tried to correct it 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.960
 I think that in the second part, we have 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:09.080
 we have had better predisposition in that 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.030
 sense also we have lacked a little 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.920
 control a bit of that mobility of 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.110
 shepherds that has done a lot of damage and 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.170
 entrelÃ­neas but good in lines 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.900
 I think that the team has returned to 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.730
 show well has been shown with a 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.630
 great attitude to attack and what 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.520
 we have made all three teams 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.560
 very powerful and good are semifinals of 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.200
 champions you have to think that we are 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:37.460
 one step from another end and therefore 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.460
 let's go to it
