00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:05.550 
hello my name is Alex offered and in

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:06.920 
hello my name is Alex offered and in
this<00:00:05.640> tutorial<00:00:05.790> we're<00:00:06.390> going<00:00:06.570> to<00:00:06.660> be<00:00:06.750> looking

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
this tutorial we're going to be looking

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.289 
this tutorial we're going to be looking
at<00:00:07.319> how<00:00:07.529> to<00:00:07.590> use<00:00:07.710> vertex<00:00:08.339> colors<00:00:08.940> with<00:00:09.539> cycles

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:11.299 
at how to use vertex colors with cycles

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:14.239 
at how to use vertex colors with cycles
now<00:00:12.299> there<00:00:12.570> is<00:00:12.659> a<00:00:12.690> few<00:00:13.169> ways<00:00:13.199> that<00:00:13.589> we<00:00:13.679> would

00:00:14.239 --> 00:00:14.249 
now there is a few ways that we would

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:16.850 
now there is a few ways that we would
want<00:00:14.429> to<00:00:14.579> do<00:00:14.820> this<00:00:15.139> the<00:00:16.139> first<00:00:16.350> way<00:00:16.529> is<00:00:16.650> from

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:16.860 
want to do this the first way is from

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.770 
want to do this the first way is from
our<00:00:17.010> one<00:00:17.130> dead<00:00:17.279> buddy<00:00:17.520> from<00:00:17.790> detail<00:00:18.150> but<00:00:18.630> we're

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:18.780 
our one dead buddy from detail but we're

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.290 
our one dead buddy from detail but we're
not<00:00:18.960> might<00:00:19.260> not<00:00:19.290> want<00:00:20.250> to<00:00:20.310> add<00:00:20.730> in<00:00:21.090> some

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
not might not want to add in some

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.910 
not might not want to add in some
textures<00:00:21.810> so<00:00:22.050> you<00:00:22.110> can't<00:00:22.290> texture<00:00:22.710> paint

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
textures so you can't texture paint

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.070 
textures so you can't texture paint
these<00:00:23.040> istick<00:00:23.580> restraints<00:00:24.120> as<00:00:24.240> masks<00:00:24.780> and<00:00:24.960> all

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
these istick restraints as masks and all

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.020 
these istick restraints as masks and all
that<00:00:25.260> kind<00:00:25.500> of<00:00:25.620> stuff<00:00:25.740> but<00:00:26.550> you<00:00:26.610> probably

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:27.030 
that kind of stuff but you probably

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.300 
that kind of stuff but you probably
don't<00:00:27.210> want<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.360> do<00:00:27.539> that<00:00:27.780> whereas<00:00:28.710> vertex

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
don't want to do that whereas vertex

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.550 
don't want to do that whereas vertex
painting<00:00:29.700> is<00:00:29.820> quite<00:00:30.120> easy<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.660> doesn't<00:00:31.350> take

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
painting is quite easy and doesn't take

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.319 
painting is quite easy and doesn't take
long<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:31.830> set<00:00:32.099> up<00:00:34.460> another<00:00:35.460> reason<00:00:35.909> is<00:00:36.030> you<00:00:36.179> can

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
long to set up another reason is you can

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.540 
long to set up another reason is you can
actually<00:00:36.480> use<00:00:36.870> it<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.199> create<00:00:37.800> your<00:00:37.920> ambient

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
actually use it to create your ambient

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.160 
actually use it to create your ambient
occlusion<00:00:38.960> baked<00:00:39.960> into<00:00:40.230> your<00:00:40.589> object<00:00:42.170> so

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
occlusion baked into your object so

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.599 
occlusion baked into your object so
let's<00:00:43.350> get<00:00:43.530> started<00:00:43.920> we're<00:00:44.280> going<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.460> go<00:00:44.550> to

00:00:44.599 --> 00:00:44.609 
let's get started we're going to go to

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:47.569 
let's get started we're going to go to
the<00:00:44.879> object<00:00:45.059> data<00:00:45.390> panel<00:00:45.449> and<00:00:46.100> add<00:00:47.100> in<00:00:47.339> a

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
the object data panel and add in a

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.229 
the object data panel and add in a
vertex<00:00:48.269> color<00:00:49.280> now<00:00:50.280> you<00:00:50.609> can<00:00:50.819> use<00:00:51.030> multiple

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
vertex color now you can use multiple

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.770 
vertex color now you can use multiple
various<00:00:51.870> colors<00:00:52.170> but<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:53.069> is<00:00:53.550> usually<00:00:54.510> based

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
various colors but it is usually based

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.219 
various colors but it is usually based
just<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.289> stick<00:00:55.530> with<00:00:55.769> the<00:00:56.039> one<00:00:56.839> especially<00:00:57.839> if

00:00:58.219 --> 00:00:58.229 
just to stick with the one especially if

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:01.629 
just to stick with the one especially if
you're<00:00:58.379> working<00:00:58.530> with<00:00:58.710> game<00:00:59.120> really<00:01:00.120> assets

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:01.639 
you're working with game really assets

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:06.460 
you're working with game really assets
okay<00:01:02.639> so<00:01:02.850> let's<00:01:03.269> get<00:01:03.539> started<00:01:03.929> painting<00:01:04.170> our

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
okay so let's get started painting our

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.360 
okay so let's get started painting our
vertices<00:01:07.470> so<00:01:07.830> if<00:01:07.890> we<00:01:07.980> go<00:01:08.100> into<00:01:08.220> vertex<00:01:08.610> paint

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:10.370 
vertices so if we go into vertex paint

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.090 
vertices so if we go into vertex paint
we<00:01:11.370> can<00:01:11.600> turn<00:01:12.600> on<00:01:12.720> our<00:01:12.870> wireframe<00:01:13.350> there<00:01:13.560> now

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
we can turn on our wireframe there now

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.880 
we can turn on our wireframe there now
that's<00:01:14.280> only<00:01:14.400> visible<00:01:14.760> in<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.030> textured<00:01:15.540> view

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
that's only visible in a textured view

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.580 
that's only visible in a textured view
and<00:01:16.890> that<00:01:17.070> will<00:01:17.160> help<00:01:17.310> us<00:01:17.550> to<00:01:18.170> see<00:01:19.170> things<00:01:19.380> a

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
and that will help us to see things a

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.300 
and that will help us to see things a
little<00:01:19.740> better<00:01:21.560> all<00:01:22.560> right<00:01:22.680> so<00:01:22.980> let's<00:01:23.130> grab

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
little better all right so let's grab

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.630 
little better all right so let's grab
some<00:01:23.490> red<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:26.960> let's<00:01:27.960> make<00:01:28.170> Suzanne<00:01:28.650> nice<00:01:29.250> and

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
some red and let's make Suzanne nice and

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:36.590 
some red and let's make Suzanne nice and
happy<00:01:32.810> you<00:01:33.810> go<00:01:34.430> it<00:01:35.430> will<00:01:35.610> grab<00:01:35.820> some<00:01:36.030> blue<00:01:36.300> of

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
happy you go it will grab some blue of

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:48.240 
happy you go it will grab some blue of
the<00:01:36.990> eyes

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.200

why not just to show you some variety
here<00:01:56.530> you<00:01:57.530> can<00:01:57.680> paint<00:01:57.979> whatever<00:01:58.189> you<00:01:58.490> want

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
alright so yes that looks horrible but

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:08.800 
alright so yes that looks horrible but
that<00:02:05.149> it<00:02:05.210> was<00:02:05.299> perfectly<00:02:05.630> fine<00:02:07.149> okay<00:02:08.149> so<00:02:08.209> with

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
that it was perfectly fine okay so with

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.590 
that it was perfectly fine okay so with
that<00:02:08.840> one<00:02:09.140> there<00:02:09.640> we<00:02:10.640> need<00:02:10.789> to<00:02:11.030> bring<00:02:11.330> up<00:02:11.450> the

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
that one there we need to bring up the

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.390 
that one there we need to bring up the
node<00:02:12.080> editor<00:02:14.560> and<00:02:15.560> make<00:02:15.860> sure<00:02:16.010> we<00:02:16.130> correct

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
node editor and make sure we correct

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.240 
node editor and make sure we correct
material<00:02:16.940> and<00:02:17.140> a<00:02:18.140> diffuse<00:02:18.470> material<00:02:18.590> will<00:02:19.160> be

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
material and a diffuse material will be

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:25.590 
material and a diffuse material will be
fine<00:02:19.489> for<00:02:19.700> this<00:02:22.510> but<00:02:23.510> it's<00:02:23.630> going<00:02:23.810> input<00:02:24.260> and

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
fine for this but it's going input and

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.190 
fine for this but it's going input and
want<00:02:26.600> to<00:02:26.630> go<00:02:26.870> edit<00:02:27.530> a<00:02:27.920> attribute<00:02:29.019> or<00:02:30.019> just

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
want to go edit a attribute or just

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.150 
want to go edit a attribute or just
popping<00:02:30.500> that<00:02:31.480> beard<00:02:32.480> it's<00:02:32.630> color<00:02:32.980> put<00:02:33.980> that

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
popping that beard it's color put that

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.080 
popping that beard it's color put that
on<00:02:34.280> to<00:02:34.400> diffuse<00:02:34.850> and<00:02:35.660> if<00:02:36.200> we<00:02:36.319> jump<00:02:36.739> into<00:02:36.980> if<00:02:37.970> we

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
on to diffuse and if we jump into if we

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.750 
on to diffuse and if we jump into if we
make<00:02:38.239> sure<00:02:38.360> we<00:02:38.450> have<00:02:38.480> a<00:02:39.069> background<00:02:40.069> first<00:02:40.610> so

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
make sure we have a background first so

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:47.259 
make sure we have a background first so
that<00:02:40.790> we<00:02:40.940> can<00:02:41.090> see<00:02:41.299> what<00:02:41.720> we're<00:02:41.840> doing<00:02:46.120> we<00:02:47.120> get

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
that we can see what we're doing we get

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:51.640 
that we can see what we're doing we get
into<00:02:47.510> rendered<00:02:47.780> view<00:02:50.110> you<00:02:51.110> can<00:02:51.230> see<00:02:51.350> we<00:02:51.500> now

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
into rendered view you can see we now

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.470 
into rendered view you can see we now
have<00:02:51.680> a<00:02:52.100> vertex<00:02:52.459> colors<00:02:52.940> working<00:02:53.600> in<00:02:53.840> cycles

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
have a vertex colors working in cycles

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.990 
have a vertex colors working in cycles
so<00:02:56.480> this<00:02:56.660> will<00:02:56.810> work<00:02:56.840> with<00:02:57.140> anything<00:02:57.410> you<00:02:57.709> can

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
so this will work with anything you can

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.400 
so this will work with anything you can
turn<00:02:59.000> this<00:02:59.120> on<00:02:59.239> top<00:02:59.390> glossy<00:02:59.900> you<00:03:00.109> can<00:03:00.260> turn

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
turn this on top glossy you can turn

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:06.390 
turn this on top glossy you can turn
this<00:03:00.620> onto<00:03:01.280> a<00:03:02.739> translucent<00:03:03.910> glass<00:03:05.170> it's

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
this onto a translucent glass it's

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.930 
this onto a translucent glass it's
entirely<00:03:07.400> up<00:03:07.700> to<00:03:07.730> you<00:03:08.060> and<00:03:09.400> it<00:03:10.400> does<00:03:10.609> give<00:03:10.910> some
