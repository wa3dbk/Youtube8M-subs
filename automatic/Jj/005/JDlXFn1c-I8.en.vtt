 Some do well, that was quite some getting used 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.970
 what he thought 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.439
 everyone needs the driver to be olympic 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.060
 play to get proof of an i find 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:09.530
 the pursuit super 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.110
 but sometimes you have to 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.000
 yes give room would change address 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.709
 be because you do have a tutu 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.780

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.630
 train hard and work hard dick in the more 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.060
 than just like the history or is crt 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.970

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:42.350
 teammate peter and this sim-lock who he 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.000
 den ham bridge 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.739
 now after ten rounds in the rabo 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.900
 main class turns out to be the German one 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.160
 welcome appearance on the national 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.019
 hockey fields 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.239
 and he can also judge how it works 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:54.739
 with the level in the 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:58.459
 Dutch competition 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:03:00.080
 itenc this is the lecture slower here 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.870
 than the years before i chose the ladder 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.400
 farrelly and colleagues left for the olymp 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.780

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.739
 countries 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:12.170
 serving know the lower than the usb vol 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:14.989
 but this similar to the german lip-synch 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.670
 easy is important for the team ' 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:19.940
 of course very important 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.290
 just a quality player and we are the busiest 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.500
 I understand occasionally at the competition 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.730
 but they also struggle jobs 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.519
 yes of course it is important for 10 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.590
 but i can't help carlos it like that 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:31.610
 downplaying or for boys number so can 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.750
 I'll just mention that very important 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.730
 are for the team 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.750
 finally about the temperament 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.989
 of both 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:41.750
 nerado as a coach for and death because that 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:42.829
 would of course be possible 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.049
 to crash 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:47.150
 the not once start of kiss 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:48.380
 no life was completely new and beyond 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.150

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.370
 He knows how I am him know it all 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.420

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.540
 stand and that's it 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:04:01.070
 center who who who who who who crash 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.519
 cso wfm and the friendship francesca clay 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.380

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.280
 as a hockey or my experience 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:10.340
