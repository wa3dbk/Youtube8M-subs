also<00:03:58.130> super<00:03:58.700> easy<00:03:58.730> to<00:03:59.120> use<00:03:59.360> we<00:04:00.320> take<00:04:00.530> a<00:04:00.560> look<00:04:00.800> at

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
also super easy to use we take a look at

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.890 
also super easy to use we take a look at
it<00:04:01.130> we<00:04:01.640> have<00:04:01.670> two<00:04:02.090> different<00:04:02.420> channels<00:04:02.570> for

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
it we have two different channels for

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.200 
it we have two different channels for
inputs<00:04:03.230> so<00:04:03.620> we<00:04:03.740> have<00:04:03.830> an<00:04:03.920> XLR<00:04:04.460> quarter-inch

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:05.210 
inputs so we have an XLR quarter-inch

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:08.020 
inputs so we have an XLR quarter-inch
input<00:04:05.720> on<00:04:05.870> channel<00:04:06.200> 1<00:04:06.410> which<00:04:07.220> can<00:04:07.430> be<00:04:07.490> mic<00:04:07.790> or

either one you can plug an instrument

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.450 
either one you can plug an instrument
into<00:04:17.120> either<00:04:17.299> one<00:04:17.570> or<00:04:18.260> you<00:04:18.799> could<00:04:18.950> do<00:04:19.070> one<00:04:19.340> or

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:19.460 
into either one or you could do one or

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:21.940 
into either one or you could do one or
the<00:04:19.489> other<00:04:19.580> so<00:04:20.030> if<00:04:20.150> I<00:04:20.270> was<00:04:20.420> using<00:04:20.570> it<00:04:20.810> for<00:04:21.080> a<00:04:21.380> mic

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
the other so if I was using it for a mic

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.280 
the other so if I was using it for a mic
on<00:04:22.190> one<00:04:22.400> channel<00:04:22.640> kusik<00:04:23.570> guitar<00:04:23.840> let's<00:04:24.080> say<00:04:24.200> on

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290 
on one channel kusik guitar let's say on

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:25.780 
on one channel kusik guitar let's say on
the<00:04:24.350> other<00:04:24.530> channel<00:04:24.890> it<00:04:25.370> makes<00:04:25.520> it<00:04:25.669> very

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790 
the other channel it makes it very

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.510 
the other channel it makes it very
flexible<00:04:26.169> to<00:04:27.169> use<00:04:27.320> the<00:04:27.470> system

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
flexible to use the system

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.390 
flexible to use the system
we<00:04:29.030> also<00:04:29.180> included<00:04:29.690> a<00:04:29.840> through<00:04:30.380> so<00:04:31.099> this<00:04:31.280> is

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
we also included a through so this is

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.339 
we also included a through so this is
for<00:04:31.580> daisy-chaining<00:04:32.090> speakers<00:04:32.630> so<00:04:32.930> if<00:04:33.199> you're

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:33.349 
for daisy-chaining speakers so if you're

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:34.689 
for daisy-chaining speakers so if you're
using<00:04:33.500> it<00:04:33.680> for<00:04:33.710> a<00:04:33.860> monitor<00:04:34.310> and<00:04:34.460> want<00:04:34.639> to

using it for a monitor and want to

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:37.059 
using it for a monitor and want to
daisy-chain<00:04:34.970> multiple<00:04:35.599> monitors<00:04:36.020> simply<00:04:36.919> go

00:04:37.059 --> 00:04:37.069 
daisy-chain multiple monitors simply go

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:38.770 
daisy-chain multiple monitors simply go
in<00:04:37.250> one<00:04:37.430> of<00:04:37.460> the<00:04:37.610> inputs<00:04:37.970> and<00:04:38.180> out<00:04:38.330> the<00:04:38.509> through

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
in one of the inputs and out the through

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.080 
in one of the inputs and out the through
or<00:04:39.050> if<00:04:39.680> you're<00:04:39.770> using<00:04:39.919> it<00:04:40.130> for<00:04:40.160> a<00:04:40.340> mono<00:04:40.580> system

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
or if you're using it for a mono system

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.120 
or if you're using it for a mono system
or<00:04:41.419> a<00:04:41.479> delay<00:04:42.080> system<00:04:42.410> where<00:04:42.800> you're<00:04:42.919> having

multiple speakers in a line again it's a

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:47.379 
multiple speakers in a line again it's a
quick<00:04:45.530> way<00:04:45.710> to<00:04:45.740> get<00:04:45.979> signal<00:04:46.460> into<00:04:46.910> the<00:04:47.030> speaker

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:47.389 
quick way to get signal into the speaker

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:49.360 
quick way to get signal into the speaker
and<00:04:47.569> back<00:04:47.810> out<00:04:48.020> of<00:04:48.050> the<00:04:48.229> loudspeaker<00:04:48.770> into

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
and back out of the loudspeaker into

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.370 
and back out of the loudspeaker into
additional<00:04:50.060> speakers<00:04:50.449> we've<00:04:50.720> included<00:04:51.020> input

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
additional speakers we've included input

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.890 
additional speakers we've included input
attenuators<00:04:52.130> for<00:04:52.370> each<00:04:52.430> channel<00:04:52.880> so<00:04:53.509> channel

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
attenuators for each channel so channel

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.140 
attenuators for each channel so channel
1<00:04:54.080> and<00:04:54.110> channel<00:04:54.259> 2<00:04:54.560> have<00:04:55.009> attenuators<00:04:55.910> and

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
1 and channel 2 have attenuators and

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.120 
1 and channel 2 have attenuators and
then<00:04:56.539> we<00:04:56.630> have<00:04:56.750> a<00:04:56.780> master<00:04:57.080> volume<00:04:57.319> control<00:04:57.919> so

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
then we have a master volume control so

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.159 
then we have a master volume control so
now<00:04:58.610> once<00:04:59.000> you've<00:04:59.180> set<00:04:59.449> the<00:04:59.599> levels<00:04:59.900> of<00:05:00.080> your

now once you've set the levels of your

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:02.200 
now once you've set the levels of your
independent<00:05:00.770> sources<00:05:01.159> you<00:05:01.639> can<00:05:01.759> now<00:05:01.909> use<00:05:02.060> the

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
independent sources you can now use the

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.510 
independent sources you can now use the
master<00:05:02.509> volume<00:05:02.720> just<00:05:03.080> to<00:05:03.169> raise<00:05:03.380> or<00:05:03.800> lower<00:05:03.830> the

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
overall volume of the loudspeaker we

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.610 
overall volume of the loudspeaker we
also<00:05:07.669> included<00:05:08.120> some<00:05:08.210> quick<00:05:08.539> EQ<00:05:09.050> presets<00:05:09.229> on
