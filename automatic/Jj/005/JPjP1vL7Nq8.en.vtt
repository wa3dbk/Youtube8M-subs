00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.170
 the country of study 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.260
 He is 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:24.830
 and bitter cold 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:28.250
 I left the sea behind to return 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:32.900

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:41.660
 found on the coast of youth 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.890
 I think of the good old days that I am 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.890
 on the seabed 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:51.860

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.860
 to a ship and to the sea 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:04.020
 Just like every human being, I have my weaknesses 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:07.080
 so give myself what i have 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:09.390
 tried to build the boats that is 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.400
 of course meaningless if you're in the middle of one 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.640
 forest lives 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.160
 the village of la totally your pain when i 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.600

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.150
 set 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.160
 could build a nice house for myself and 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.229
 and may have some houses 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.390
 to recover 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.790
 but it didn't help 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.600
 the residents of river falls must 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.820
 have actually made the gods angry 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.090
 when the village and almost run 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.910
 old glory you state was it was again 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.020
 the fire got worse and devastated 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.960
 worse 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.600
 everything in again until the big snowstorm 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.150
 debris left 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:55.180
 why don't I know I'm determined 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:59.200
 to decipher 30 riddle 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:01.410

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.410
 tomb 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.100
 the village has been destroyed so I don't know 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.950
 how long I will continue to live here 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:14.030
 maybe what i get my stuff and i go 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:16.730
 looking for other Jewish people 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.980
 but i also have a duties my dad 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.020
 had discovered something and this it for me 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.590
 like 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:27.580
 I have come a long way but I feel my 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:31.080
 not to father 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:34.710
 so i go even further until i know what 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.710
 he had found 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:41.560
 It all started at the cool place and 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:44.020
 ends from the smoke 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.620
 to riddle but riddle solved 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.069
 to have 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:52.310
 I returned to the cemetery and there 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:54.409
 we found the door of the tomb 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:58.549
 now I have to have a pickaxe in a garden 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:03:01.030
 to find out what's behind that 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:01.030
 between 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.140
 and ripping off leaving and not 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.720
 sat still 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:23.010
 I immediately started digging and got 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:25.739
 a whole my spending looking in cavities 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.640
 to thailand you get a new home 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:32.400
 needed and I will come up with only one place 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:34.620
 so i left and am just getting hit 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.049
 before it goes live 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.780
 I restored it to its old one 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:43.019
 glory to be livable 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:45.389
 is no longer dangerous of course 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:48.540
 it's way too big for myself 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:49.650
 but this is only temporary in one day 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.859
 I will again 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:56.639
 search for Jewish from other tribes 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:58.049
 but for now I am looking for this 

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:59.989
 time it 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:03.440
 the blacksmith is already waiting for the door 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:06.680
 so I've turned people 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:09.680
 to make a pickaxe and hang flags 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:12.080
 so again the pan 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.850
 hook and furthermore there is an honorable one 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.650
 fortress 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.269
 I made a nice room and one 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.940
 from the towers 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.900

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.900

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.979
 also to be able to use combat skills 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.870
 train 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:32.479
 I made a job for 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:34.970
 archery and some dummies monteverde 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:36.770
 hitting before it's set again 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:40.930
 between old glory 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:45.919
 Now that I remember my name is really full of animals 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:48.370

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:48.370
