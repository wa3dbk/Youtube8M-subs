00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:15.919 

silicon<00:00:13.139> is<00:00:13.170> very<00:00:13.500> permeable<00:00:13.980> so<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.120> gel<00:00:15.509> can

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
silicon is very permeable so the gel can

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.890 
silicon is very permeable so the gel can
leach<00:00:16.199> out<00:00:16.470> of<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:17.400> shower<00:00:17.699> also<00:00:18.480> when<00:00:18.660> there

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
leach out of the shower also when there

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.290 
leach out of the shower also when there
is<00:00:18.990> an<00:00:19.140> actual<00:00:19.320> rupture<00:00:20.100> that<00:00:20.820> happens

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
is an actual rupture that happens

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.870 
is an actual rupture that happens
because<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.720> silicon<00:00:22.260> is<00:00:22.650> relatively<00:00:23.640> weak

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
because the silicon is relatively weak

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.320 
because the silicon is relatively weak
and<00:00:24.500> the<00:00:25.500> material<00:00:26.070> we<00:00:26.189> are<00:00:26.220> proposing<00:00:26.760> would

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
and the material we are proposing would

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.470 
and the material we are proposing would
help<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:28.529> solve<00:00:28.830> these<00:00:29.010> issues<00:00:29.519> it<00:00:29.939> would<00:00:30.240> not

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
help to solve these issues it would not

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:40.459 
help to solve these issues it would not
let<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:31.050> gel<00:00:31.349> reaching<00:00:32.040> out<00:00:38.899> we<00:00:39.899> can<00:00:40.170> use<00:00:40.440> a

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
let the gel reaching out we can use a

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.580 
let the gel reaching out we can use a
coating<00:00:41.250> from<00:00:41.640> our<00:00:41.969> material<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.960> we<00:00:43.410> can

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
coating from our material and we can

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.540 
coating from our material and we can
incorporate<00:00:43.890> drugs<00:00:44.579> into<00:00:45.120> this<00:00:45.239> coating<00:00:45.600> and

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
incorporate drugs into this coating and

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.910 
incorporate drugs into this coating and
also<00:00:47.550> imaging<00:00:48.059> agents<00:00:48.750> so<00:00:49.320> this<00:00:49.530> will<00:00:49.739> be<00:00:49.890> a

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
also imaging agents so this will be a

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.600 
also imaging agents so this will be a
low-cost<00:00:50.489> slow<00:00:50.940> release<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.690> cancer

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
low-cost slow release of cancer

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.150 
low-cost slow release of cancer
therapeutic<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:53.879> imaging<00:00:54.420> agents<00:00:55.110> so<00:00:55.320> this

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
therapeutic and imaging agents so this

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:05.560 
therapeutic and imaging agents so this
will<00:00:56.370> also<00:00:56.550> help<00:00:56.940> in<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.840> healing<00:00:58.020> process

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.020 

we<00:01:06.570> can<00:01:06.750> also<00:01:06.960> incorporate<00:01:07.580> painkillers<00:01:08.580> into

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
we can also incorporate painkillers into

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.540 
we can also incorporate painkillers into
this<00:01:09.240> coating<00:01:09.660> so<00:01:10.590> that<00:01:10.830> would<00:01:11.130> make<00:01:11.280> it

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
this coating so that would make it

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.020 
this coating so that would make it
easier<00:01:12.270> on<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.170> wall<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.740> also<00:01:14.460> with<00:01:14.880> the

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
easier on the wall and also with the

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.690 
easier on the wall and also with the
diagnostic<00:01:15.540> agent<00:01:16.290> we<00:01:16.860> can<00:01:17.070> target<00:01:17.340> the

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
diagnostic agent we can target the

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.450 
diagnostic agent we can target the
cancer<00:01:18.150> cells<00:01:18.510> so<00:01:18.870> if<00:01:19.140> that<00:01:19.380> was<00:01:19.620> any<00:01:19.920> left

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
cancer cells so if that was any left

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.880 
cancer cells so if that was any left
over<00:01:20.970> but<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.360> surgeon<00:01:21.900> was<00:01:22.170> not<00:01:22.380> able<00:01:22.620> to

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
over but the surgeon was not able to

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.730 
over but the surgeon was not able to
remove<00:01:23.220> then<00:01:24.060> we<00:01:24.300> could<00:01:24.600> image<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.620> we

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
remove then we could image that and we

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.620 
remove then we could image that and we
could<00:01:25.920> see<00:01:26.190> where<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.760> cancer<00:01:27.000> is<00:01:27.180> still

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
could see where the cancer is still

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.100 
could see where the cancer is still
there

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
there

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.950 
there
and<00:01:28.200> in<00:01:28.920> addition<00:01:29.070> we<00:01:30.030> could<00:01:30.180> deliver<00:01:30.450> drugs

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
and in addition we could deliver drugs

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.400 
and in addition we could deliver drugs
into<00:01:31.800> the<00:01:31.920> cancer<00:01:32.190> cells<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.960> local

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:34.410 
into the cancer cells and the local

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.910 
into the cancer cells and the local
delivery<00:01:34.979> requires<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.910> lot<00:01:36.360> less<00:01:36.619> over<00:01:37.619> ground

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
delivery requires a lot less over ground

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.150 
delivery requires a lot less over ground
so<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.940> side-effects<00:01:39.660> of<00:01:39.750> regular<00:01:40.320> systemic

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.160 
so the side-effects of regular systemic

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:55.280 
so the side-effects of regular systemic
chemotherapy<00:01:41.840> would<00:01:42.840> be<00:01:43.050> reduced<00:01:53.780> this<00:01:54.780> money

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
chemotherapy would be reduced this money

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.130 
chemotherapy would be reduced this money
is<00:01:55.500> very<00:01:55.770> important<00:01:56.550> on<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:57.090> road<00:01:57.330> to

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
is very important on the road to

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.350 
is very important on the road to
speeding<00:01:58.500> up<00:01:58.800> this<00:01:59.009> research<00:01:59.550> and<00:01:59.910> bring<00:02:00.060> it

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
speeding up this research and bring it

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.920 
speeding up this research and bring it
from<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.200> bench<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.920> bedside<00:02:02.360> this<00:02:03.360> type

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
from the bench to the bedside this type

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.200 
from the bench to the bedside this type
of<00:02:03.960> research<00:02:04.470> requires<00:02:05.009> a<00:02:05.250> really<00:02:05.880> large

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
of research requires a really large

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.540 
of research requires a really large
amount<00:02:06.300> of<00:02:06.720> money<00:02:06.899> especially<00:02:07.550> clinical

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
amount of money especially clinical

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.160 
amount of money especially clinical
trials<00:02:09.149> so<00:02:09.960> winning<00:02:10.890> of<00:02:11.250> this<00:02:11.520> award<00:02:12.030> out<00:02:12.810> of

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
trials so winning of this award out of

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.270 
trials so winning of this award out of
six<00:02:13.500> hundred<00:02:13.740> entries<00:02:14.520> from<00:02:14.880> 45<00:02:15.690> countries

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
six hundred entries from 45 countries

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.420 
six hundred entries from 45 countries
they<00:02:17.280> selected<00:02:17.880> five<00:02:18.180> winners<00:02:18.720> and<00:02:19.080> so<00:02:20.040> I<00:02:20.069> was

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
they selected five winners and so I was

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.390 
they selected five winners and so I was
really<00:02:20.790> ecstatic<00:02:21.240> and<00:02:22.050> I<00:02:22.290> found<00:02:22.590> out<00:02:22.830> that<00:02:23.100> our

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
really ecstatic and I found out that our

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.260 
really ecstatic and I found out that our
group<00:02:23.760> was<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.300> one<00:02:24.750> of<00:02:24.900> the<00:02:25.050> winners
