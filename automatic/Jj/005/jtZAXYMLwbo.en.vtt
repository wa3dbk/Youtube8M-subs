are gonna come through the program you

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.830 
are gonna come through the program you
know<00:02:02.430> I<00:02:02.460> think<00:02:02.549> at<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.270> end<00:02:03.299> of<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.540> day<00:02:03.659> we

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
know I think at the end of the day we

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.209 
know I think at the end of the day we
really<00:02:04.110> are<00:02:04.290> just<00:02:04.350> excited<00:02:04.740> about<00:02:05.040> making

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
really are just excited about making

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.889 
really are just excited about making
sure<00:02:05.399> that<00:02:05.520> our<00:02:05.700> players<00:02:06.030> have<00:02:06.390> access<00:02:06.750> to

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
sure that our players have access to

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.479 
sure that our players have access to
tons<00:02:07.110> of<00:02:07.259> original<00:02:07.680> content<00:02:07.829> so<00:02:08.220> I<00:02:08.250> think<00:02:08.310> this

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
tons of original content so I think this

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.190 
tons of original content so I think this
is<00:02:08.550> probably<00:02:08.819> bad<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.629> best<00:02:09.810> way<00:02:09.899> to<00:02:09.929> do<00:02:10.080> it

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
is probably bad the best way to do it

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.479 
is probably bad the best way to do it
there's<00:02:10.470> a<00:02:10.530> lot<00:02:10.709> of<00:02:10.800> reasons<00:02:11.069> to<00:02:11.129> still<00:02:11.370> go

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
there's a lot of reasons to still go

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.320 
there's a lot of reasons to still go
with<00:02:11.520> a<00:02:11.640> publisher<00:02:11.940> I<00:02:12.060> mean<00:02:12.239> I<00:02:12.270> think

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
with a publisher I mean I think

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.150 
with a publisher I mean I think
self-publishing<00:02:13.140> is<00:02:13.290> a<00:02:13.349> great<00:02:13.590> option<00:02:13.800> for<00:02:13.980> a

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
self-publishing is a great option for a

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.380 
self-publishing is a great option for a
lot<00:02:14.280> of<00:02:14.400> developers<00:02:14.819> but<00:02:15.060> going<00:02:15.180> with<00:02:15.270> a

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
lot of developers but going with a

really<00:02:55.470> you<00:02:55.650> know<00:02:55.739> our<00:02:55.830> focus<00:02:56.099> is<00:02:56.250> really<00:02:56.280> just

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
really you know our focus is really just

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.220 
really you know our focus is really just
getting<00:02:56.790> great<00:02:57.120> original<00:02:57.569> content<00:02:57.959> so<00:02:58.080> we

that's what's gonna kind of be the best

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.059 
that's what's gonna kind of be the best
for<00:03:03.239> developers<00:03:03.690> to<00:03:03.900> get<00:03:04.290> original<00:03:04.739> content

on<00:03:41.069> Xbox<00:03:41.519> one<00:03:41.610> we<00:03:42.000> really<00:03:42.269> have<00:03:42.390> this

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
on Xbox one we really have this

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.300 
on Xbox one we really have this
philosophical<00:03:43.260> view<00:03:43.440> that<00:03:43.620> a<00:03:43.650> game<00:03:43.920> is<00:03:43.950> a<00:03:44.159> game

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
philosophical view that a game is a game

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.970 
philosophical view that a game is a game
as<00:03:44.489> a<00:03:44.519> game<00:03:44.790> and<00:03:45.090> so<00:03:45.510> all<00:03:45.690> the<00:03:45.870> games<00:03:46.080> on<00:03:46.560> the

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
as a game and so all the games on the

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.470 
as a game and so all the games on the
platform<00:03:47.459> whether<00:03:47.670> they're<00:03:47.909> developed<00:03:48.269> by<00:03:48.360> an

platform whether they're developed by an

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.240 
platform whether they're developed by an
independent<00:03:48.690> developer<00:03:49.379> and<00:03:49.620> self-published

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
independent developer and self-published

huge array of different methods for

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:56.509 
huge array of different methods for
people<00:03:55.650> to<00:03:55.739> discover<00:03:56.099> them

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
people to discover them

Phil talked about some of them in the

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.470 
Phil talked about some of them in the
briefing<00:03:58.830> but<00:03:59.069> like<00:03:59.310> you<00:04:00.000> know<00:04:00.030> whether<00:04:00.269> it's

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
briefing but like you know whether it's

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.370

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
you know most popular or trending

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:04.870 
you know most popular or trending
you<00:04:03.470> know<00:04:03.560> there's<00:04:03.740> ways<00:04:03.920> you<00:04:04.130> can<00:04:04.250> see<00:04:04.430> what

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
you know there's ways you can see what

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.520 
you know there's ways you can see what
your<00:04:05.030> friends<00:04:05.060> are<00:04:05.540> playing<00:04:05.720> and<00:04:06.110> also<00:04:06.350> sort

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
your friends are playing and also sort

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:07.930 
your friends are playing and also sort

of what your gaming community is playing
so<00:04:08.360> we<00:04:08.480> think<00:04:08.540> it's<00:04:08.690> gonna<00:04:08.780> be<00:04:08.930> a<00:04:08.960> really

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
so we think it's gonna be a really

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.110 
so we think it's gonna be a really
interesting<00:04:09.470> way<00:04:09.740> to<00:04:09.800> surface<00:04:10.160> content<00:04:10.580> we've

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
interesting way to surface content we've

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.390 
interesting way to surface content we've
also<00:04:11.240> got<00:04:11.450> game<00:04:11.630> DVR<00:04:11.840> and<00:04:12.410> upload<00:04:12.800> so<00:04:13.250> you<00:04:13.280> can

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
also got game DVR and upload so you can

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.100 
also got game DVR and upload so you can
record<00:04:13.790> some<00:04:14.210> footage<00:04:14.510> of<00:04:14.570> yourself<00:04:14.900> playing

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.110 
record some footage of yourself playing

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:17.260
