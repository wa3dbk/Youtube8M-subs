00:00:01.759 --> 00:00:04.540
 not hard for anyone 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.500
 here we talk about scene 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.950
 For feeling that my hour 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.289
 I have no doubt said 

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:12.500
 the world yet in the center of rome 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.810
 touched the ball to get rid of the opinions if the 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.880
 we are interested in the challenge we have now. 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.039
 materialize people 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:28.529
 success these technologies never gotten more impressive the reality 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:29.399
 presented 

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:32.399
 They abandoned the car and the house in SÃ£o Paulo. 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.579
 check out 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:41.660
 at the 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.660
 not 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:06.990
 - with the help of Internet users chose to use 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.960
 he added 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.710
 having one of the smaller of the chosen we passed or 3d modeling that is made a 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.150
 digital file that after weighing this material has suffered some 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.820
 manual justice 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.369
 so they have to understand that it is one of them 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:25.369
 which has a certain malleability when 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.560
 we are going to the results below the most delicate points but we can not 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.409
 to win paulo 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.149
 our intention is that the same rules in this sense I like more 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.040
 we try to assemble a selection in a single product 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.229
 process from now on and further down day improvement of a proposal from the 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:50.330
 that the generation of alternatives 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.540
 I found that materialized 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.330
 It's very good and very interesting. 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.990
 hence the surprise said that it was very close to what you imagined 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.580
 today was our first assessment of the agreement in one of them 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.440
 on Friday 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.670
 was along with the chest one in the front pointed some points that 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:12.299
 the need for change and change 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:17.889
 despite this military advice initially by two people two 

00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:18.680
 adults 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.190
 we noticed that there were rules to admit that we will have for two adults and 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.350
 A child in a tie for a small family 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:28.579
 the delegate 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:30.660
 the black African levers 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:31.629
 Earth 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:34.629
 the soap opera 

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:37.509
 not virtual 

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:41.399
 we have a lot of security doing with a little doll he also avoided 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:47.199
 but that three-in-three accessibility of headdress actually made course 

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:48.189
 modern 

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:49.999
 They are there, we sit there. 

00:02:49.999 --> 00:02:52.549
 came cancer with brother 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:57.979
 analyze one side or the other and end up with a precise notion of what 

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:59.219
 needs to be modified 

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:01.739
 by the way, we kind of 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.819
 I will not search my space. 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:09.169
 collaborative work is very different from what we're used to seeing. 

00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:14.179
 inversion in the sale he was doing is that I ask if he likes to receive six 

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:14.869
 months 

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:18.179
 besides this action we sing in what you think of it 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:25.400
 we have to take a very choice attitude the type of open companies that 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.530
 I would say that it is one of the great difficulties that we have today. 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.239
 public consultation 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:33.260
 to break paradigms 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.109
 for example flywheels 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:38.449
 we figured people should not lose the wheel 

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:43.469
 but we are seeing that the steering wheel is very important because it 

00:03:43.469 --> 00:03:46.939
 is still something that we learn to live that way. 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.010
 Despite this, the future in the case of town planning in the 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.300
 difference that I did not lose was with the design 

00:03:57.169 --> 00:04:01.299
 is the design is drawing the other proposals is not the collision yet 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:04.299
 are very large 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:13.039
 the teaching of the great seasons - see now that they intend to modify 

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:14.969
 quite the monoposto 

00:04:14.969 --> 00:04:18.999
 Finally fred how much more opinions do we see 

00:04:18.999 --> 00:04:20.669
 more sure said 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:25.909
 adding more people this is the logic of our way of choosing him 

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:28.909
 It's what I did - 

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:31.080
 the next step now 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.710
 - I knew that today you put a few dots 

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:38.289
 but in mathematics nowadays 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:39.680
 in this region 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.680
 to start reverse engineering 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.300
 will do a lot of people did not expect 

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:51.440
 owen 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:52.220
 check out 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.309
 all 

00:04:53.309 --> 00:04:56.309
 not yet 

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:08.219
 heart 

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:09.839
 it's the part 

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:12.939
 the completion of a juninho 

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:16.909
 you have to register the surfaces according to the context 

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:18.329
 before ending my
