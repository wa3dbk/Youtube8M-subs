00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.249 
our next desktop mount so you can have
it<00:01:32.790> in<00:01:32.970> this<00:01:33.420> sort<00:01:33.600> of<00:01:33.659> position<00:01:34.020> for<00:01:34.049> example

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
it in this sort of position for example

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.920 
it in this sort of position for example
and<00:01:35.009> get<00:01:35.220> your<00:01:35.400> iPad<00:01:35.700> mounted<00:01:36.150> onto<00:01:36.390> there<00:01:36.750> so

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
and get your iPad mounted onto there so

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.240 
and get your iPad mounted onto there so
you<00:01:37.020> can<00:01:37.200> just<00:01:37.439> place<00:01:37.740> it<00:01:37.950> in<00:01:38.040> whatever

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
you can just place it in whatever

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.770 
you can just place it in whatever
position<00:01:38.610> wherever<00:01:38.939> angle<00:01:39.360> whatever<00:01:39.509> height

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
position wherever angle whatever height

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.410 
position wherever angle whatever height
you<00:01:39.810> prefer<00:01:40.740> so<00:01:41.009> again<00:01:41.670> this<00:01:41.850> bit<00:01:42.030> here's<00:01:42.210> got

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
you prefer so again this bit here's got

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.270 
you prefer so again this bit here's got
a<00:01:42.450> locking<00:01:42.810> mechanism<00:01:42.840> into<00:01:43.530> place<00:01:43.770> that

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
a locking mechanism into place that

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.770 
a locking mechanism into place that
allows<00:01:44.549> you<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.729> then<00:01:45.119> secure<00:01:45.570> it<00:01:45.600> into

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
allows you to then secure it into

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.300 
allows you to then secure it into
position<00:01:46.259> so<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.710> first<00:01:46.950> thing<00:01:47.070> you<00:01:47.159> need<00:01:47.250> to

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
position so the first thing you need to

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.700 
position so the first thing you need to
do<00:01:47.490> is<00:01:47.549> get<00:01:47.759> that<00:01:47.960> twisted<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.320> locked<00:01:49.560> into

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
do is get that twisted and locked into

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.249 
do is get that twisted and locked into
position<00:01:49.950> so<00:01:50.430> if<00:01:51.119> you<00:01:51.240> just<00:01:51.420> do<00:01:51.570> that<00:01:51.600> melt<00:01:52.020> so

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
position so if you just do that melt so

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.749 
position so if you just do that melt so
you<00:01:52.350> get<00:01:52.500> that<00:01:52.649> picking<00:01:53.040> feedback<00:01:53.399> once<00:01:53.640> you

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
you get that picking feedback once you

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.490 
you get that picking feedback once you
do<00:01:53.880> that<00:01:54.090> so<00:01:54.299> that's<00:01:54.479> locked<00:01:54.750> into<00:01:54.990> position

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
do that so that's locked into position

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.319 
do that so that's locked into position
and<00:01:55.649> then<00:01:56.189> what<00:01:56.460> you<00:01:56.549> need<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.820> do<00:01:56.939> is<00:01:57.060> get<00:01:57.240> your

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
and then what you need to do is get your

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.469 
and then what you need to do is get your
iPad<00:01:57.719> and<00:01:57.930> put<00:01:58.920> that<00:01:59.009> into<00:01:59.159> there<00:01:59.399> and<00:01:59.610> suck<00:02:00.329> it

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
iPad and put that into there and suck it

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.440 
iPad and put that into there and suck it
in<00:02:00.600> by<00:02:01.200> just<00:02:01.500> using<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.369> air<00:02:02.520> pump<00:02:02.790> just<00:02:03.210> under

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
in by just using the air pump just under

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.240 
in by just using the air pump just under
side<00:02:03.630> there<00:02:03.869> so<00:02:03.899> if<00:02:04.110> you<00:02:04.170> just<00:02:04.320> do<00:02:04.469> that<00:02:04.680> no<00:02:07.250> so

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
side there so if you just do that no so

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.100 
side there so if you just do that no so
once<00:02:08.489> it's<00:02:08.700> done<00:02:08.789> that<00:02:09.450> will<00:02:09.629> go<00:02:09.750> all<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:09.959> way

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
once it's done that will go all the way

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.170 
once it's done that will go all the way
in<00:02:10.379> so<00:02:10.530> you<00:02:10.649> won't<00:02:10.830> see<00:02:11.009> it<00:02:11.129> put<00:02:11.310> protruding

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
in so you won't see it put protruding

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.430 
in so you won't see it put protruding
anymore<00:02:12.599> so<00:02:12.780> that<00:02:12.810> just<00:02:13.080> goes

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
anymore so that just goes

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.130 
anymore so that just goes
and<00:02:13.950> then<00:02:14.520> you<00:02:14.640> can<00:02:14.850> start<00:02:15.090> using<00:02:15.300> your<00:02:15.480> iPad<00:02:15.870> a

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
and then you can start using your iPad a

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.950 
and then you can start using your iPad a
twist<00:02:16.790> all<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:17.850> way<00:02:18.030> there<00:02:18.420> as<00:02:18.510> you<00:02:18.630> can<00:02:18.660> see

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
twist all the way there as you can see

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.630 
twist all the way there as you can see
whatever<00:02:19.410> way<00:02:19.650> you<00:02:19.710> want<00:02:19.830> so<00:02:20.250> we<00:02:20.340> can<00:02:20.490> lift

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
whatever way you want so we can lift

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.850 
whatever way you want so we can lift
that<00:02:20.730> up<00:02:20.910> quite<00:02:21.360> a<00:02:21.420> bit<00:02:21.690> more<00:02:21.930> so<00:02:22.470> you<00:02:22.530> can<00:02:22.680> turn

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
that up quite a bit more so you can turn

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.580 
that up quite a bit more so you can turn
that<00:02:23.010> around<00:02:23.130> 360<00:02:23.820> degrees<00:02:24.290> motion<00:02:25.290> there<00:02:25.500> as

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
that around 360 degrees motion there as

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.130 
that around 360 degrees motion there as
you<00:02:25.710> can<00:02:25.740> see<00:02:25.890> and<00:02:26.330> you<00:02:27.330> can<00:02:27.480> place<00:02:27.690> that<00:02:27.720> just

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
you can see and you can place that just

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.710 
you can see and you can place that just
however<00:02:28.470> you<00:02:28.710> want<00:02:28.980> is<00:02:29.130> entirely<00:02:29.610> up<00:02:30.330> to<00:02:30.390> you

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
and that feels totally secure into place

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.760 
and that feels totally secure into place
it<00:02:33.330> doesn't<00:02:33.780> move<00:02:33.870> anywhere<00:02:34.200> as<00:02:34.380> you<00:02:34.410> can<00:02:34.590> see
