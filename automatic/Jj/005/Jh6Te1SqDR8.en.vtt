photograph can be very different from
the<00:01:21.119> actual<00:01:21.299> yarn<00:01:21.840> that<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.080> get<00:01:22.229> because<00:01:23.000> in

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
the actual yarn that you get because in

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.830 
the actual yarn that you get because in
the<00:01:24.840> printing<00:01:25.200> process<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:26.479> the<00:01:27.479> lighting

the printing process and the lighting

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.630 
the printing process and the lighting
that<00:01:27.960> they<00:01:28.080> use<00:01:28.350> every<00:01:28.799> everything<00:01:29.280> can

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
that they use every everything can

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.230 
that they use every everything can
affect<00:01:29.970> what<00:01:30.810> color<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.470> see<00:01:31.770> so<00:01:32.610> when<00:01:33.150> I'm

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
affect what color you see so when I'm

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.929 
affect what color you see so when I'm
looking<00:01:33.390> at<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.780> colors<00:01:34.170> that<00:01:34.530> she<00:01:34.939> called

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
looking at the colors that she called

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.719 
looking at the colors that she called
for<00:01:36.119> on<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.299> pattern<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:38.220> colors<00:01:38.520> in<00:01:38.670> the

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
for on the pattern and the colors in the

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.289 
for on the pattern and the colors in the
photo<00:01:40.130> the<00:01:41.130> one<00:01:41.159> color<00:01:41.520> that<00:01:41.670> seems<00:01:42.060> slightly

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
photo the one color that seems slightly

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.480 
photo the one color that seems slightly
different<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.899> me<00:01:43.020> is<00:01:43.290> this<00:01:43.890> color<00:01:44.130> here<00:01:44.310> this

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
different to me is this color here this

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.880 
different to me is this color here this
is<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.790> more<00:01:45.000> it<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:45.600> in<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.200> photo<00:01:46.409> it<00:01:46.829> looks

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
is the more it and in the photo it looks

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.789 
is the more it and in the photo it looks
a<00:01:47.189> lot<00:01:47.340> lighter<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:48.049> so<00:01:49.049> that's<00:01:49.350> one<00:01:49.590> of<00:01:49.740> the

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
a lot lighter and so that's one of the

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.580 
a lot lighter and so that's one of the
reasons<00:01:50.189> why<00:01:50.750> you<00:01:51.750> don't<00:01:51.930> want<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.229> order<00:01:52.560> a

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
reasons why you don't want to order a

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.399 
reasons why you don't want to order a
big<00:01:52.950> batch<00:01:53.189> of<00:01:53.220> yarn<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:54.600> commit<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:55.110> a<00:01:55.140> project

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
big batch of yarn to commit to a project

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.940 
big batch of yarn to commit to a project
until<00:01:56.130> you've<00:01:56.909> seen<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.270> color<00:01:57.540> you're<00:01:58.469> happy

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950
