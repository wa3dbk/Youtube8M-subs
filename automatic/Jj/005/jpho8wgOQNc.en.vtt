00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
going straight into the PA which sounded

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.580 
awful
I<00:02:38.739> got<00:02:39.430> a<00:02:39.459> preamp<00:02:39.939> and<00:02:40.090> then<00:02:40.269> I<00:02:40.480> Jason<00:02:41.079> said<00:02:41.469> why

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
I got a preamp and then I Jason said why

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.020 
I got a preamp and then I Jason said why
don't<00:02:41.650> you<00:02:41.769> get<00:02:41.950> a<00:02:41.980> delay<00:02:42.340> pedal<00:02:42.639> or<00:02:43.000> a

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
don't you get a delay pedal or a

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.550 
don't you get a delay pedal or a
distortion<00:02:43.599> pedal<00:02:43.900> so<00:02:44.019> those<00:02:44.170> were<00:02:44.319> the<00:02:44.379> first

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
distortion pedal so those were the first

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.539 
distortion pedal so those were the first
two<00:02:44.739> pedals<00:02:45.129> I<00:02:45.250> got<00:02:45.459> and<00:02:46.349> and<00:02:47.349> then<00:02:48.219> I<00:02:48.250> kind<00:02:48.519> of

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
two pedals I got and and then I kind of

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:50.159 
two pedals I got and and then I kind of
incorporated<00:02:49.239> that<00:02:49.329> into<00:02:49.540> what<00:02:49.719> I<00:02:49.750> was<00:02:49.930> doing

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:50.169 
incorporated that into what I was doing

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:53.190 
incorporated that into what I was doing
but<00:02:50.319> all<00:02:50.650> along<00:02:50.950> I<00:02:51.549> think<00:02:52.049> because<00:02:53.049> I<00:02:53.169> was

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
but all along I think because I was

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.610 
but all along I think because I was
working<00:02:53.590> with<00:02:53.769> a<00:02:54.090> singer-songwriter<00:02:55.090> it<00:02:56.019> was

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
working with a singer-songwriter it was

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.459 
working with a singer-songwriter it was
about<00:02:57.099> making<00:02:57.459> a<00:02:57.669> good<00:02:57.879> strong<00:02:58.510> part<00:02:58.959> that<00:02:59.349> was

00:02:59.459 --> 00:02:59.469 
about making a good strong part that was

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:01.589 
about making a good strong part that was
simple<00:02:59.889> and<00:03:00.129> just<00:03:00.400> kind<00:03:00.699> of<00:03:00.760> served<00:03:01.060> the<00:03:01.329> song

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599 
simple and just kind of served the song

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:03.659 
simple and just kind of served the song
so<00:03:01.930> I<00:03:01.989> think<00:03:02.290> that's<00:03:02.500> kind<00:03:02.859> of<00:03:02.919> informed<00:03:03.459> how<00:03:03.639> I

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:03.669 
so I think that's kind of informed how I

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:06.420 
so I think that's kind of informed how I
play<00:03:04.030> the<00:03:04.810> parts<00:03:05.139> I<00:03:05.260> come<00:03:05.439> up<00:03:05.620> with<00:03:05.650> and<00:03:06.069> then

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
play the parts I come up with and then

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.270 
play the parts I come up with and then
we<00:03:06.549> probably<00:03:06.849> would<00:03:07.090> I<00:03:07.120> write<00:03:07.419> now<00:03:08.169> as<00:03:08.530> a<00:03:08.560> solo

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
we probably would I write now as a solo

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.610 
we probably would I write now as a solo

works at William Harris Lee he crafted
it<00:03:28.090> it's<00:03:28.680> 19<00:03:29.680> I<00:03:30.099> think<00:03:30.940> it's<00:03:31.239> a<00:03:31.329> 92<00:03:31.840> no<00:03:32.230> no<00:03:32.379> it's

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
it it's 19 I think it's a 92 no no it's

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.000 
it it's 19 I think it's a 92 no no it's
a<00:03:33.239> 2002<00:03:34.239> I<00:03:34.269> think<00:03:34.780> it's<00:03:35.019> like<00:03:35.260> it<00:03:35.440> sounds<00:03:35.620> great

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
a 2002 I think it's like it sounds great

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.580 
a 2002 I think it's like it sounds great
acoustic<00:03:36.640> because<00:03:37.420> it<00:03:37.510> sounds<00:03:37.780> good<00:03:37.959> acoustic

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
acoustic because it sounds good acoustic

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:39.720 
acoustic because it sounds good acoustic
I<00:03:38.709> think<00:03:38.890> it<00:03:38.950> sounds<00:03:39.220> good<00:03:39.370> through<00:03:39.610> my

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
I think it sounds good through my

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.030 
I think it sounds good through my
kettles<00:03:40.090> I've<00:03:40.690> not<00:03:40.900> tried<00:03:41.200> it<00:03:41.440> too<00:03:41.620> much<00:03:41.829> to

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
kettles I've not tried it too much to

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.309 
kettles I've not tried it too much to
play<00:03:42.250> an<00:03:42.400> electric<00:03:42.879> cello<00:03:43.150> but<00:03:43.599> I<00:03:43.660> really<00:03:44.140> like

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 
play an electric cello but I really like

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:47.130 
play an electric cello but I really like
the<00:03:44.530> sound<00:03:44.709> of<00:03:44.920> the<00:03:44.980> hollow<00:03:45.160> body<00:03:45.489> and<00:03:46.140> so

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
the sound of the hollow body and so

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.479 
the sound of the hollow body and so
that's<00:03:47.319> why<00:03:47.500> I<00:03:47.530> keep<00:03:47.709> playing<00:03:48.040> my<00:03:48.250> acoustic

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
that's why I keep playing my acoustic

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:50.940 
that's why I keep playing my acoustic
through<00:03:49.359> this<00:03:49.510> even<00:03:50.260> though<00:03:50.349> there's<00:03:50.709> some

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
through this even though there's some

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.880 
through this even though there's some
challenges<00:03:51.459> with<00:03:51.640> the<00:03:51.849> amp<00:03:52.739> what<00:03:53.739> are<00:03:53.829> the

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
challenges with the amp what are the

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.500 
challenges with the amp what are the
challenges<00:03:54.069> well<00:03:54.760> feedback<00:03:56.730> but<00:03:57.730> it<00:03:58.180> can<00:03:58.359> be<00:03:58.480> a

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
challenges well feedback but it can be a

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.059 
challenges well feedback but it can be a
good<00:03:58.659> thing<00:03:58.870> and<00:03:59.140> somehow<00:03:59.470> I<00:03:59.590> think<00:03:59.769> if<00:03:59.980> my

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:00.069 
good thing and somehow I think if my

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:02.099 
good thing and somehow I think if my
body<00:04:00.280> is<00:04:00.519> in<00:04:00.670> between<00:04:00.940> the<00:04:01.090> cabinet<00:04:01.299> and<00:04:01.690> the

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:02.109 
body is in between the cabinet and the

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:07.410 
body is in between the cabinet and the
cello<00:04:02.459> I<00:04:03.510> avoid<00:04:04.510> an<00:04:05.760> unwanted<00:04:06.760> feedback<00:04:07.180> and<00:04:07.390> I

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
cello I avoid an unwanted feedback and I

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:08.729 
cello I avoid an unwanted feedback and I
think<00:04:07.599> I've<00:04:07.690> tried<00:04:07.959> I've<00:04:08.260> learned<00:04:08.530> how<00:04:08.709> to

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
think I've tried I've learned how to

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:11.160 
think I've tried I've learned how to
kind<00:04:09.010> of<00:04:09.099> work<00:04:09.250> with<00:04:09.310> my<00:04:09.609> pedals<00:04:10.000> so<00:04:10.989> that<00:04:11.140> I

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
kind of work with my pedals so that I

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:12.750 
kind of work with my pedals so that I
can<00:04:11.409> play<00:04:11.680> loud<00:04:11.950> and<00:04:12.220> get<00:04:12.310> a<00:04:12.340> big<00:04:12.519> sound

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
can play loud and get a big sound

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:22.350 
can play loud and get a big sound
without<00:04:12.909> it<00:04:13.180> being<00:04:13.359> out<00:04:13.510> of<00:04:13.540> control
