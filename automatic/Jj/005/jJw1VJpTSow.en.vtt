 around 1000 over 1,300 3 and that has 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.420

 indeed it was 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:01.259
 the prices are going to 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:04.049
 to fish for today is 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.210
 interesting interesting to observe that 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:09.539
 there was on the part of the employees of the 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.240
 very steep jobs also expected let's say 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.660

 to interest rates 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.330
 the central Australian institution indeed 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.980
 left the rates as planned 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.650
 cut internet pardoned rates 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.620

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.200
 2 percent historical 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:32.230
 after leaving them for a precedent 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.980
 records unchanged at 2 pt 5 per cent ad 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.150
 beginning of the end 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:40.030
 what the governor commented on 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:42.640
 glenn steven is that there are signs 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.650
 strong and positive on the front

 depreciation of the dollar 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.630
 appears likely necessary 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:07.090
 especially due to the significant decline 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:10.690
