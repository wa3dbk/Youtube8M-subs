00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460 
more mile Italy we saw I won't feel it

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.430 
more mile Italy we saw I won't feel it
everywhere<00:05:09.699> yeah<00:05:10.090> I'm<00:05:10.300> the<00:05:10.449> nil<00:05:10.780> nil<00:05:10.960> wit<00:05:11.229> news

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 
everywhere yeah I'm the nil nil wit news

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.499 
everywhere yeah I'm the nil nil wit news
even<00:05:11.680> so<00:05:12.069> the<00:05:12.400> form<00:05:12.639> lines<00:05:12.909> don't<00:05:13.120> work<00:05:13.240> too

00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:13.509 
even so the form lines don't work too

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:15.870 
even so the form lines don't work too
clever<00:05:13.750> from<00:05:14.050> both<00:05:14.259> know<00:05:14.650> and<00:05:14.919> then<00:05:15.159> I<00:05:15.520> think

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 
clever from both know and then I think

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.309 
clever from both know and then I think
what<00:05:16.000> could<00:05:16.180> change<00:05:16.479> the<00:05:16.690> makeup<00:05:16.840> of<00:05:17.080> the<00:05:17.139> game

00:05:17.309 --> 00:05:17.319 
what could change the makeup of the game

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:19.020 
what could change the makeup of the game
as<00:05:17.470> if<00:05:17.590> there<00:05:17.740> was<00:05:17.860> an<00:05:18.039> utterly<00:05:18.220> Spanish<00:05:18.729> goal

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.030 
as if there was an utterly Spanish goal

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:20.999 
as if there was an utterly Spanish goal
it'd<00:05:19.569> be<00:05:19.690> very<00:05:19.720> interesting<00:05:20.500> to<00:05:20.620> see<00:05:20.770> then

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:21.009 
it'd be very interesting to see then

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:22.770 
it'd be very interesting to see then
what<00:05:21.159> happens<00:05:21.490> to<00:05:21.639> the<00:05:21.729> paranoia<00:05:22.210> you'd<00:05:22.569> like

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:22.780
