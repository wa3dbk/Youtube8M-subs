00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:09.799 
realize until after I'd shot it that I

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:11.949 
realize until after I'd shot it that I
didn't<00:04:10.069> get<00:04:10.220> a<00:04:10.280> very<00:04:10.340> good<00:04:10.549> view<00:04:10.849> of<00:04:11.000> that<00:04:11.030> but

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
didn't get a very good view of that but

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:13.630

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.130 
basically you pull down on that tab that
I<00:04:13.700> showed<00:04:13.970> you<00:04:14.060> before<00:04:14.180> and<00:04:14.660> then<00:04:14.750> you<00:04:14.780> twist

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
the motor it would be counterclockwise

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.069 
the motor it would be counterclockwise
and<00:04:19.549> then<00:04:19.880> it'll<00:04:20.060> come<00:04:20.299> down<00:04:20.359> and<00:04:20.660> out

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079
