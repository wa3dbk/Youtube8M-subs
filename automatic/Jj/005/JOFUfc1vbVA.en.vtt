00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330 
that's why I'm go again see it's a lot

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:08.020 
that's why I'm go again see it's a lot
faster<00:04:02.330> more<00:04:03.290> accurate<00:04:03.920> and<00:04:06.430> at<00:04:07.430> heart<00:04:07.760> so<00:04:07.970> if

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
faster more accurate and at heart so if

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:15.810 
faster more accurate and at heart so if
you<00:04:08.120> happen<00:04:12.460> that<00:04:13.460> as<00:04:13.610> a<00:04:13.640> really<00:04:14.000> step<00:04:14.590> really

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:15.820 
you happen that as a really step really

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:23.230 
you happen that as a really step really
pull<00:04:16.820> it<00:04:16.940> right<00:04:17.090> back<00:04:17.150> instead<00:04:18.020> just<00:04:22.150> pull<00:04:23.150> it

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
pull it right back instead just pull it

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.080 
pull it right back instead just pull it
back<00:04:23.270> instead<00:04:23.960> it<00:04:24.080> is<00:04:24.110> normally<00:04:24.650> so<00:04:25.090> that's

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
back instead it is normally so that's

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.900 
back instead it is normally so that's
that<00:04:26.470> that<00:04:27.470> we<00:04:27.710> just<00:04:27.950> done<00:04:28.160> the<00:04:28.280> second<00:04:28.700> one

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
that that we just done the second one

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.220 
that that we just done the second one
and<00:04:29.350> you<00:04:30.350> can<00:04:30.500> see<00:04:31.150> instead<00:04:32.150> of<00:04:32.330> here<00:04:32.660> how

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:33.230 
and you can see instead of here how

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:34.000 
and you can see instead of here how
about<00:04:33.470> here

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
about here

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:39.220 
about here
and<00:04:35.920> that<00:04:36.920> was<00:04:37.220> the<00:04:37.430> step<00:04:37.790> that<00:04:38.660> had<00:04:38.900> their

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:39.230 
and that was the step that had their

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:44.440 
and that was the step that had their
unloaded<00:04:40.100> all<00:04:41.200> yeah<00:04:42.280> that's<00:04:43.280> like<00:04:43.460> three

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:44.450 
unloaded all yeah that's like three

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:48.970 
unloaded all yeah that's like three
steps<00:04:44.780> down<00:04:45.080> and<00:04:46.420> so<00:04:47.470> that's<00:04:48.470> a<00:04:48.590> lot<00:04:48.800> more

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:48.980 
steps down and so that's a lot more

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.640 
steps down and so that's a lot more
power<00:04:49.220> and<00:04:49.430> it<00:04:49.580> does<00:04:49.730> heart<00:04:50.320> if<00:04:51.320> you<00:04:51.470> shoot

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
power and it does heart if you shoot

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.970 
power and it does heart if you shoot
them

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:51.980 
them

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.070 
them
