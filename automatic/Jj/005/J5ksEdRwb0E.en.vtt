the difference with with with this setup

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.179 
the difference with with with this setup
I<00:01:44.700> watched<00:01:44.939> someone's<00:01:45.930> video<00:01:46.110> on<00:01:46.439> I<00:01:46.770> can't

I watched someone's video on I can't

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.789 
I watched someone's video on I can't
remember<00:01:47.310> who<00:01:47.490> maybe<00:01:47.670> was<00:01:47.850> drifters<00:01:48.799> or

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
remember who maybe was drifters or

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.889 
remember who maybe was drifters or
drifter<00:01:50.130> but<00:01:50.790> I<00:01:51.060> was<00:01:51.270> watching<00:01:51.420> someone's

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
drifter but I was watching someone's

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.770 
drifter but I was watching someone's
video<00:01:52.049> or<00:01:52.320> doing<00:01:52.829> some<00:01:53.009> some<00:01:53.430> reading<00:01:54.119> on<00:01:54.240> the

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
video or doing some some reading on the

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.770 
video or doing some some reading on the
effectiveness<00:01:55.229> of<00:01:55.530> Deadeye<00:01:56.780> statistically

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
effectiveness of Deadeye statistically

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.539 
effectiveness of Deadeye statistically
on<00:01:57.899> all<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.079> guns<00:01:58.290> and<00:01:58.500> it<00:01:59.009> turns<00:01:59.159> out<00:01:59.310> that<00:01:59.430> it

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
on all the guns and it turns out that it

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.249 
on all the guns and it turns out that it
has<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.790> most<00:01:59.939> benefit<00:02:00.479> for<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:01.049> lower

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259

powered<00:02:01.680> ARS<00:02:02.100> like<00:02:02.310> this<00:02:02.549> gun<00:02:02.700> so<00:02:02.939> it<00:02:03.000> was

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
powered ARS like this gun so it was

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.450 
powered ARS like this gun so it was
convenient<00:02:03.420> that<00:02:03.659> I<00:02:03.689> picked<00:02:03.899> it<00:02:03.990> up<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.460> ACR

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
convenient that I picked it up the ACR

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.800 
convenient that I picked it up the ACR
wannabe<00:02:05.850> whatever<00:02:06.090> this<00:02:06.210> one's<00:02:06.420> called<00:02:06.540> and

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
wannabe whatever this one's called and

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.320 
wannabe whatever this one's called and
then<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.399> lower<00:02:08.580> damage<00:02:08.789> submachine

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
then the the the lower damage submachine

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.210 
then the the the lower damage submachine
guns<00:02:09.539> like<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.810> Vepr<00:02:09.959> or<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.979> one<00:02:11.129> that

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
guns like the Vepr or the the one that

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.350 
guns like the Vepr or the the one that
nobody<00:02:11.489> uses<00:02:11.940> starts<00:02:12.690> with<00:02:12.780> C

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
nobody uses starts with C

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.640 
nobody uses starts with C
I<00:02:13.420> think<00:02:13.870> I'm<00:02:14.290> not<00:02:14.440> sure<00:02:14.620> or<00:02:15.160> the<00:02:15.340> k7<00:02:16.500> it<00:02:17.500> works

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
I think I'm not sure or the k7 it works

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
I think I'm not sure or the k7 it works
good<00:02:17.800> on<00:02:17.860> that<00:02:17.950> one<00:02:18.190> too<00:02:18.310> because<00:02:18.370> I<00:02:18.520> think

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
good on that one too because I think

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:19.800 
good on that one too because I think
that<00:02:18.790> one's<00:02:18.970> the<00:02:19.000> lowest<00:02:19.330> damaged<00:02:19.600> because<00:02:19.720> of

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
that one's the lowest damaged because of

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.620 
that one's the lowest damaged because of
the<00:02:19.930> integrated<00:02:20.590> silencer<00:02:21.070> but<00:02:21.310> the<00:02:21.910> k7<00:02:22.330> sux

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
the integrated silencer but the k7 sux

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.540 
the integrated silencer but the k7 sux
ballz<00:02:22.720> it's<00:02:23.260> like<00:02:23.620> the<00:02:23.740> recoil<00:02:24.160> is<00:02:24.250> just<00:02:24.400> all

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
ballz it's like the recoil is just all

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.170 
ballz it's like the recoil is just all
over<00:02:24.580> the<00:02:24.850> place<00:02:24.880> I<00:02:25.180> don't<00:02:25.240> like<00:02:25.450> it<00:02:25.600> at<00:02:25.690> all

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
over the place I don't like it at all

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.120 
over the place I don't like it at all
but<00:02:28.180> yeah<00:02:28.330> so<00:02:28.690> this<00:02:28.990> is<00:02:29.140> uh<00:02:29.170> this<00:02:29.530> is<00:02:29.590> some<00:02:29.770> Kem

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
but yeah so this is uh this is some Kem

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.490 
but yeah so this is uh this is some Kem
strike<00:02:30.280> I<00:02:30.520> did<00:02:31.000> a<00:02:31.030> little<00:02:31.750> bit<00:02:31.900> of<00:02:32.020> editing<00:02:32.110> to

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
strike I did a little bit of editing to

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.620 
strike I did a little bit of editing to
make<00:02:32.620> sure<00:02:32.770> that<00:02:32.920> the<00:02:33.130> video<00:02:33.910> didn't<00:02:34.270> drag<00:02:34.450> on

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
make sure that the video didn't drag on

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.660 
make sure that the video didn't drag on
too<00:02:34.810> long<00:02:35.100> because<00:02:36.100> there<00:02:36.220> are<00:02:36.340> some<00:02:36.550> parts

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
too long because there are some parts

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.460 
too long because there are some parts
like<00:02:36.910> somebody<00:02:37.180> had<00:02:37.300> got<00:02:37.450> a<00:02:37.480> helo<00:02:37.840> pilot<00:02:38.020> early

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
like somebody had got a helo pilot early

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:39.750 
like somebody had got a helo pilot early
on<00:02:38.590> and<00:02:38.800> I<00:02:38.860> ended<00:02:39.040> up<00:02:39.130> just<00:02:39.310> kind<00:02:39.430> of<00:02:39.520> staying

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
on and I ended up just kind of staying

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.850 
on and I ended up just kind of staying
up<00:02:39.910> in<00:02:39.970> this<00:02:40.090> building<00:02:40.300> until<00:02:40.540> it<00:02:40.810> was<00:02:40.959> until

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
up in this building until it was until

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.610 
up in this building until it was until
it<00:02:41.890> was<00:02:42.010> down<00:02:42.310> or<00:02:42.850> went<00:02:43.120> away<00:02:43.180> and<00:02:43.570> I<00:02:44.260> figured

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
it was down or went away and I figured

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:45.810 
it was down or went away and I figured
that<00:02:44.650> might<00:02:44.920> have<00:02:45.040> been<00:02:45.100> might<00:02:45.610> have<00:02:45.700> been<00:02:45.790> a

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
that might have been might have been a

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.660 
that might have been might have been a
little<00:02:45.910> boring<00:02:46.209> to<00:02:46.360> watch<00:02:47.250> what's<00:02:48.250> up<00:02:48.400> with<00:02:48.550> me

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
little boring to watch what's up with me

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.030 
little boring to watch what's up with me
today<00:02:48.820> so<00:02:48.970> it's<00:02:49.300> it's<00:02:49.600> Thursday<00:02:50.200> it's<00:02:50.890> about

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
today so it's it's Thursday it's about

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.440 
today so it's it's Thursday it's about
four<00:02:51.280> o'clock<00:02:51.459> as<00:02:51.700> I'm<00:02:51.820> recording<00:02:51.910> this<00:02:52.270> I'm

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
four o'clock as I'm recording this I'm

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:53.850 
four o'clock as I'm recording this I'm
going<00:02:52.540> to<00:02:52.600> upload<00:02:52.900> it<00:02:53.020> right<00:02:53.050> afterwards<00:02:53.590> and

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
going to upload it right afterwards and

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.060 
going to upload it right afterwards and
I'm<00:02:53.950> gonna<00:02:54.070> do<00:02:54.280> a<00:02:54.690> hop<00:02:55.690> on<00:02:55.870> APL's<00:02:56.380> live<00:02:56.800> show

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
I'm gonna do a hop on APL's live show

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.729 
I'm gonna do a hop on APL's live show
today<00:02:57.430> and<00:02:57.640> do<00:02:57.760> a<00:02:57.790> 1v1<00:02:58.450> on<00:02:58.900> shipment<00:02:59.380> I<00:02:59.500> haven't

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
today and do a 1v1 on shipment I haven't

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:04.110 
today and do a 1v1 on shipment I haven't
played<00:02:59.920> a<00:03:00.450> 1v1<00:03:01.450> on<00:03:01.720> shipment<00:03:02.140> in<00:03:02.400> a<00:03:03.400> long<00:03:03.910> time

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
played a 1v1 on shipment in a long time

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.050 
played a 1v1 on shipment in a long time
it's<00:03:04.630> been<00:03:05.100> probably<00:03:06.100> over<00:03:06.340> a<00:03:06.580> year<00:03:06.790> since<00:03:06.940> I

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
it's been probably over a year since I

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.350 
it's been probably over a year since I
played<00:03:07.270> a<00:03:07.300> 1v1<00:03:07.600> on<00:03:07.840> shipment<00:03:08.230> but<00:03:08.860> I<00:03:09.270> used<00:03:10.270> to

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
played a 1v1 on shipment but I used to

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.940 
played a 1v1 on shipment but I used to
play<00:03:10.420> that<00:03:10.600> obsessively<00:03:11.260> like<00:03:11.560> I<00:03:11.680> think<00:03:11.739> I

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
play that obsessively like I think I

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.770 
play that obsessively like I think I
probably<00:03:12.190> have<00:03:12.580> just<00:03:12.610> as<00:03:12.970> much<00:03:13.150> time<00:03:13.420> logged

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
probably have just as much time logged

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.110 
probably have just as much time logged
in<00:03:14.020> private<00:03:14.470> matches<00:03:14.650> and<00:03:14.980> cod4<00:03:15.160> as<00:03:15.489> I<00:03:15.610> do<00:03:15.670> in

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
in private matches and cod4 as I do in

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.680 
in private matches and cod4 as I do in
public<00:03:17.050> matches<00:03:17.700> so<00:03:18.700> that's<00:03:18.910> going<00:03:19.360> on<00:03:19.450> at

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
public matches so that's going on at

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.740 
public matches so that's going on at
4:45<00:03:20.560> Pacific<00:03:21.370> time<00:03:21.760> today<00:03:22.060> so<00:03:22.180> just<00:03:22.600> maybe

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750
