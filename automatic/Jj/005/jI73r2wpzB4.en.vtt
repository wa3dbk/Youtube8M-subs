00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
level than synthesis bank we they have

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.420 
level than synthesis bank we they have
not<00:03:16.600> seen<00:03:16.930> Saxo<00:03:17.590> Bank<00:03:17.620> in<00:03:17.860> Denmark<00:03:18.220> do<00:03:18.310> they

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
not seen Saxo Bank in Denmark do they

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.150 
not seen Saxo Bank in Denmark do they
have<00:03:18.580> over<00:03:18.760> a<00:03:18.910> thousand<00:03:19.240> employees<00:03:19.420> and<00:03:20.160> I

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
have over a thousand employees and I

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.640 
have over a thousand employees and I
think<00:03:21.580> the<00:03:21.700> growth<00:03:21.940> is<00:03:22.240> at<00:03:22.540> the<00:03:23.140> step<00:03:23.410> which<00:03:23.590> is

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
think the growth is at the step which is

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.220 
think the growth is at the step which is
probably<00:03:24.370> more<00:03:25.150> advanced<00:03:25.510> than<00:03:25.630> synthesis

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
probably more advanced than synthesis

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.750 
probably more advanced than synthesis
