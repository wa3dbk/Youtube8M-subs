think you'll find some nice challenge on

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.940 
think you'll find some nice challenge on
the<00:04:33.240> veteran<00:04:33.630> setting<00:04:34.020> that's<00:04:34.470> also<00:04:34.800> where

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
the veteran setting that's also where

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.409 
the veteran setting that's also where
you<00:04:35.040> get<00:04:35.220> most<00:04:35.430> of<00:04:35.550> your<00:04:35.610> Xbox<00:04:36.120> Live

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 
you get most of your Xbox Live

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:53.190 
you get most of your Xbox Live
achievement<00:04:37.020> points<00:04:37.169> if<00:04:37.380> you're<00:04:37.530> into<00:04:37.740> that

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:53.200 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.050 

it's<00:04:54.200> definitely<00:04:54.740> an<00:04:54.800> intense<00:04:55.190> shooter<00:04:55.610> and

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 
it's definitely an intense shooter and

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.780 
it's definitely an intense shooter and
puts<00:04:56.480> action<00:04:57.140> well<00:04:57.650> before<00:04:58.070> plot<00:04:58.400> or<00:04:58.670> in

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:58.790 
puts action well before plot or in

gonna learn much about World War two
from<00:05:02.660> this<00:05:02.810> game<00:05:03.080> it's<00:05:03.950> incredibly<00:05:04.460> violent

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
from this game it's incredibly violent

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.240 
from this game it's incredibly violent
and<00:05:05.180> much<00:05:05.390> more<00:05:05.630> so<00:05:05.870> than<00:05:06.020> the<00:05:06.140> previous<00:05:06.620> World

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.250 
and much more so than the previous World

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:10.100 
War two based Call of Duty games the

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.500 
War two based Call of Duty games the
parts<00:05:10.460> where<00:05:10.610> enemy<00:05:10.880> prisoners<00:05:11.330> are<00:05:11.480> being

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.510 
parts where enemy prisoners are being

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.950 
parts where enemy prisoners are being
shot<00:05:11.960> at<00:05:12.230> point-blank<00:05:12.800> range<00:05:12.950> and<00:05:13.960> crawling

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
shot at point-blank range and crawling

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.720 
shot at point-blank range and crawling
through<00:05:15.110> tunnels<00:05:15.620> igniting<00:05:16.130> people<00:05:16.520> with<00:05:16.700> a

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:16.730 
through tunnels igniting people with a

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:19.270 
through tunnels igniting people with a
flamethrower<00:05:17.200> is<00:05:18.200> slightly<00:05:18.590> more<00:05:18.920> intense

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
flamethrower is slightly more intense

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:27.480 
flamethrower is slightly more intense
than<00:05:19.430> a<00:05:19.520> game<00:05:19.760> of<00:05:19.910> Mario<00:05:20.210> Kart<00:05:20.390> for<00:05:20.990> example

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.240 

the<00:05:28.490> question<00:05:29.000> is<00:05:29.270> would<00:05:29.630> Mario<00:05:30.140> Kart<00:05:30.560> benefit

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
the question is would Mario Kart benefit

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:36.300 
the question is would Mario Kart benefit
from<00:05:31.610> a<00:05:31.850> flamethrower

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:36.310 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.940 

I<00:05:36.340> think<00:05:37.330> most<00:05:37.600> video<00:05:37.930> games<00:05:38.230> with<00:05:38.440> benefits

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:38.950 
I think most video games with benefits

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:40.050 
I think most video games with benefits
from<00:05:39.100> a<00:05:39.220> flamethrower

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:40.060 
from a flamethrower

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.390 
from a flamethrower
and<00:05:40.360> it<00:05:40.480> goes<00:05:40.600> without<00:05:40.750> saying<00:05:41.400> including

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 
and it goes without saying including

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:47.520 
and it goes without saying including
games<00:05:42.639> like<00:05:42.850> Frogger<00:05:43.180> and<00:05:43.480> donkey<00:05:46.260> instead<00:05:47.260> of

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:47.530 
games like Frogger and donkey instead of

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:49.170 
games like Frogger and donkey instead of
trying<00:05:47.800> to<00:05:47.889> cross<00:05:48.190> the<00:05:48.400> road<00:05:48.550> with<00:05:48.730> precision

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.180 
trying to cross the road with precision

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:54.330 
trying to cross the road with precision
just<00:05:49.660> light<00:05:49.870> all<00:05:50.020> the<00:05:50.110> cars<00:05:50.350> on<00:05:50.590> fire

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:54.340 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.950 

and<00:05:54.880> the<00:05:55.390> flamethrower<00:05:55.870> in<00:05:56.080> this<00:05:56.260> game<00:05:56.530> is

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:57.960 
and the flamethrower in this game is

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:05.910 
and the flamethrower in this game is
pretty<00:05:58.960> cool<00:06:03.420> it<00:06:04.420> has<00:06:04.570> unlimited<00:06:04.960> ammo<00:06:05.500> as<00:06:05.680> I

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:05.920 
pretty cool it has unlimited ammo as I

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.160 
pretty cool it has unlimited ammo as I
saw<00:06:06.130> some<00:06:06.400> people<00:06:06.730> asking<00:06:07.180> but<00:06:07.750> the

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:08.170 
saw some people asking but the

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:09.840 
saw some people asking but the
ammunition<00:06:08.470> goes<00:06:08.980> down<00:06:09.280> each<00:06:09.490> time<00:06:09.520> you're

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:09.850 
ammunition goes down each time you're

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:11.130 
ammunition goes down each time you're
using<00:06:09.880> it<00:06:10.270> then<00:06:10.420> you<00:06:10.510> have<00:06:10.600> to<00:06:10.660> switch<00:06:10.810> back<00:06:11.110> to

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:11.140 
using it then you have to switch back to

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:13.500 
using it then you have to switch back to
a<00:06:11.350> different<00:06:11.590> gun<00:06:12.010> maybe<00:06:12.610> machine<00:06:13.060> gun<00:06:13.300> some

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:13.510 
a different gun maybe machine gun some

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:15.180 
a different gun maybe machine gun some
people<00:06:13.870> then<00:06:14.290> go<00:06:14.470> back<00:06:14.650> to<00:06:14.680> using<00:06:15.100> the

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:15.190 
people then go back to using the

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:28.770 
people then go back to using the
flamethrower<00:06:26.520> in<00:06:27.520> conclusion<00:06:28.120> as<00:06:28.240> you<00:06:28.630> can

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:28.780 
flamethrower in conclusion as you can

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:30.270 
flamethrower in conclusion as you can
see<00:06:28.930> on<00:06:29.080> screen<00:06:29.410> the<00:06:29.560> game<00:06:29.710> is<00:06:29.860> technically

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:30.280 
see on screen the game is technically

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:36.870 
see on screen the game is technically
solid<00:06:30.610> an<00:06:31.000> action-packed<00:06:31.720> shooter<00:06:35.880> instead

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:36.880 
solid an action-packed shooter instead

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.850 
solid an action-packed shooter instead
of<00:06:36.970> just<00:06:37.150> another<00:06:37.420> World<00:06:37.780> War<00:06:37.990> 2<00:06:38.200> game<00:06:38.440> next

of just another World War 2 game next

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:41.250 
of just another World War 2 game next
time<00:06:39.040> I'd<00:06:39.190> like<00:06:39.400> to<00:06:39.550> see<00:06:39.790> some<00:06:40.420> games<00:06:40.660> actually

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:41.260 
time I'd like to see some games actually

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.040 
time I'd like to see some games actually
tackling<00:06:41.740> world<00:06:42.010> war<00:06:42.280> 1<00:06:42.810> something<00:06:43.810> that's

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:44.050 
tackling world war 1 something that's

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:45.420 
tackling world war 1 something that's
not<00:06:44.200> only<00:06:44.410> a<00:06:44.440> lot<00:06:44.620> of<00:06:44.740> fun<00:06:44.920> to<00:06:45.040> play<00:06:45.220> but<00:06:45.280> also

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:45.430 
not only a lot of fun to play but also

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:48.060 
not only a lot of fun to play but also

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:50.320
