pretty much a straight edge but it's a

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.750 
pretty much a straight edge but it's a
lot<00:01:00.480> easier<00:01:00.809> if<00:01:00.899> it's<00:01:01.050> straight<00:01:01.550> okay<00:01:02.550> we<00:01:02.730> just

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.930 

desktops<00:02:15.750> especially<00:02:16.530> if<00:02:16.680> you<00:02:16.860> if<00:02:17.490> it's<00:02:17.820> a

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
desktops especially if you if it's a

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.150 
desktops especially if you if it's a
factory-made<00:02:18.450> it'll<00:02:19.380> be<00:02:19.470> a<00:02:19.500> little<00:02:19.740> trickier

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
factory-made it'll be a little trickier

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.800 
factory-made it'll be a little trickier
be<00:02:20.340> a<00:02:20.370> little<00:02:20.580> hard<00:02:20.700> to<00:02:20.820> get<00:02:20.940> to<00:02:21.000> but<00:02:21.330> this<00:02:21.600> will

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
be a little hard to get to but this will

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.390 
be a little hard to get to but this will
work<00:02:21.990> that's<00:02:22.320> definitely<00:02:22.980> one<00:02:23.190> of<00:02:23.220> those

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
work that's definitely one of those

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.730 
work that's definitely one of those
little<00:02:23.700> holes<00:02:23.790> on<00:02:24.060> LCDs<00:02:24.540> let's<00:02:25.320> just<00:02:25.470> do<00:02:25.620> this

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
little holes on LCDs let's just do this

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.760 
little holes on LCDs let's just do this
again<00:02:26.040> one<00:02:26.400> more<00:02:26.520> time

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
again one more time

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.620 
again one more time
take<00:02:28.770> that<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.490> paper<00:02:29.880> clip<00:02:30.090> put<00:02:30.390> it<00:02:30.450> in<00:02:30.540> the

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
take that the paper clip put it in the

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.920
