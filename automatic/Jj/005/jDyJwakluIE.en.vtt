you<00:01:16.229> what<00:01:16.439> we're<00:01:16.530> going<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.710> do<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:17.310> make<00:01:17.400> this

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
you what we're going to do to make this

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.969 
you what we're going to do to make this
beer<00:01:17.790> colder<00:01:18.360> by<00:01:18.900> intercooling<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:19.680> yeah<00:01:19.799> we

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
beer colder by intercooling it yeah we

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.469 
beer colder by intercooling it yeah we
race<00:01:20.220> car<00:01:20.490> you<00:01:20.610> take<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:20.790> turbocharged<00:01:21.330> you've

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
race car you take a turbocharged you've

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:22.999 
race car you take a turbocharged you've
got<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:21.780> hot<00:01:21.960> area<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:22.439> run<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:22.710> through<00:01:22.920> an

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
got that hot area you run it through an

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.859 
got that hot area you run it through an
ice<00:01:23.189> bath<00:01:23.520> in<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.909> inner<00:01:24.060> core<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.540> that

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
ice bath in the inner core and that

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.179 
ice bath in the inner core and that
cools<00:01:25.140> it<00:01:25.259> off<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.530> four<00:01:25.740> goes<00:01:25.890> into<00:01:25.920> the

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
cools it off the four goes into the

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.289 
cools it off the four goes into the
engine<00:01:26.460> so<00:01:26.580> what<00:01:26.700> we're<00:01:26.880> going<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.090> do<00:01:27.150> is

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
engine so what we're going to do is

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.539 
engine so what we're going to do is
we're<00:01:27.630> going<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.810> enter<00:01:28.140> cool<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.829> beer<00:01:29.189> by

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
we're going to enter cool the beer by

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.160 
we're going to enter cool the beer by
pumping<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:29.970> through<00:01:30.000> an<00:01:30.210> ice<00:01:30.360> bath<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:30.900> pump

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
pumping it through an ice bath and pump

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.100 
pumping it through an ice bath and pump
it<00:01:31.259> into<00:01:31.409> you<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.729> we're<00:01:33.360> going<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.659> do<00:01:33.840> all<00:01:34.079> of

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
it into you and we're going to do all of

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.520 
it into you and we're going to do all of
that<00:01:34.350> using<00:01:35.040> these<00:01:35.189> parts<00:01:35.610> right<00:01:36.090> here<00:01:36.530> now

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
that using these parts right here now

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.080 
that using these parts right here now
the<00:01:37.590> principle<00:01:38.130> of<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.400> intercooler<00:01:38.939> as<00:01:39.060> a

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
the principle of the intercooler as a

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.789 
the principle of the intercooler as a
system<00:01:39.540> is<00:01:39.630> pretty<00:01:39.840> simple<00:01:40.110> it<00:01:40.380> provides

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
system is pretty simple it provides

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.859 
system is pretty simple it provides
cooler<00:01:41.189> denser<00:01:41.430> air<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.180> engine<00:01:42.479> whether

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
cooler denser air to the engine whether

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.780 
cooler denser air to the engine whether
you're<00:01:43.079> using<00:01:43.259> an<00:01:43.560> ice<00:01:43.680> bath<00:01:43.979> like<00:01:44.310> in<00:01:44.430> bruno's

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
you're using an ice bath like in bruno's

is<00:01:50.310> nothing<00:01:50.610> more<00:01:50.759> than<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:50.970> big<00:01:51.149> air<00:01:51.360> pump<00:01:51.630> and

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
is nothing more than a big air pump and

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.480 
is nothing more than a big air pump and
those<00:01:52.079> things<00:01:52.350> need<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:52.860> breathe<00:01:53.220> absolutely

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
those things need to breathe absolutely

right<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:59.130> see<00:01:59.250> what<00:01:59.369> I'm<00:01:59.460> saying<00:01:59.490> brew<00:01:59.909> just

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
right you see what I'm saying brew just

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.149 
right you see what I'm saying brew just
what<00:02:00.659> just<00:02:01.140> go<00:02:01.259> with<00:02:01.439> me<00:02:01.590> on<00:02:01.619> this<00:02:01.710> I've<00:02:01.950> done

what I have found throughout my

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.289 
what I have found throughout my
calculations<00:02:05.610> is<00:02:05.729> that<00:02:05.880> if<00:02:05.969> we<00:02:06.000> take<00:02:06.240> a

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
calculations is that if we take a

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.779 
calculations is that if we take a
typical<00:02:06.600> full-size<00:02:07.259> keg<00:02:07.560> like<00:02:08.009> this<00:02:08.250> exhibit

coolidge<00:02:19.470> on<00:02:19.650> your<00:02:20.070> beer<00:02:20.250> right<00:02:20.280> now<00:02:20.610> looking

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
coolidge on your beer right now looking

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.210 
coolidge on your beer right now looking
for<00:02:21.300> those<00:02:21.510> numbers<00:02:21.870> are<00:02:22.050> 50<00:02:22.710> feet<00:02:22.920> of<00:02:22.950> tubing

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
for those numbers are 50 feet of tubing

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.040 
for those numbers are 50 feet of tubing
and<00:02:23.520> it<00:02:23.610> needs<00:02:23.790> to<00:02:23.880> be<00:02:24.000> a<00:02:24.030> quarter<00:02:24.390> inch<00:02:24.540> on<00:02:24.750> the

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
and it needs to be a quarter inch on the

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.960 
and it needs to be a quarter inch on the
inside<00:02:25.530> diameter<00:02:25.770> right<00:02:26.190> there<00:02:26.430> so<00:02:26.760> you<00:02:26.850> would

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
inside diameter right there so you would

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.670 
inside diameter right there so you would
basically<00:02:27.120> calculate<00:02:27.870> that<00:02:28.020> at<00:02:28.230> two<00:02:28.410> PI<00:02:28.650> R

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
basically calculate that at two PI R

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.370 
basically calculate that at two PI R
times<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.490> length<00:02:29.670> of<00:02:29.940> your<00:02:30.030> line<00:02:30.630> which<00:02:31.260> is

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
times the length of your line which is

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.860 
times the length of your line which is
basically<00:02:31.740> 50<00:02:32.370> feet<00:02:32.550> so<00:02:32.790> 2<00:02:32.850> PI<00:02:33.120> R<00:02:33.150> Terry<00:02:33.720> the

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
basically 50 feet so 2 PI R Terry the

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.080 
basically 50 feet so 2 PI R Terry the
four<00:02:34.080> yeah<00:02:34.410> one-quarter<00:02:34.860> x<00:02:35.310> 52<00:02:35.790> that's<00:02:35.970> like

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
four yeah one-quarter x 52 that's like

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.620 
four yeah one-quarter x 52 that's like

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
little bit of money yeah we didn't spend

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.430 
little bit of money yeah we didn't spend
too<00:04:40.120> much<00:04:40.300> money<00:04:40.449> at<00:04:40.630> all<00:04:40.720> remember<00:04:40.990> we<00:04:41.410> only

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
too much money at all remember we only

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.129 
too much money at all remember we only
paid<00:04:41.800> $25<00:04:42.669> at<00:04:42.820> a<00:04:42.850> garage<00:04:43.030> sale<00:04:43.180> for<00:04:43.750> this<00:04:43.870> gate
