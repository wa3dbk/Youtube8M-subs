dunes update it's been so long since

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.470 
dunes update it's been so long since
they<00:00:34.160> did<00:00:34.340> an<00:00:34.430> update<00:00:34.579> i<00:00:34.850> had<00:00:35.030> to<00:00:35.120> watch<00:00:35.270> the

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 
they did an update i had to watch the

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.850 
they did an update i had to watch the
last<00:00:35.690> one<00:00:35.900> to<00:00:35.930> figure<00:00:36.200> out<00:00:36.290> where<00:00:36.440> i<00:00:36.470> left<00:00:36.650> off

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
last one to figure out where i left off

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.800 
last one to figure out where i left off
you<00:00:37.460> remember<00:00:37.700> the<00:00:37.790> wire<00:00:37.940> guide<00:00:38.180> it<00:00:38.360> made<00:00:38.510> for

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:38.810 
you remember the wire guide it made for

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.290 
you remember the wire guide it made for
the<00:00:38.900> control<00:00:39.140> handle<00:00:39.500> scrapped<00:00:40.250> I<00:00:40.520> did<00:00:41.120> cut

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
the control handle scrapped I did cut

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.880 
the control handle scrapped I did cut
the<00:00:41.390> lower<00:00:41.540> half<00:00:41.750> inch<00:00:41.960> off<00:00:42.140> used<00:00:42.380> as<00:00:42.560> a<00:00:42.590> plug

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
the lower half inch off used as a plug

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.290 
the lower half inch off used as a plug
so<00:00:43.100> I<00:00:43.130> guess<00:00:43.340> it<00:00:43.489> wasn't<00:00:43.610> a<00:00:43.760> total<00:00:43.790> waste<00:00:44.090> of

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
so I guess it wasn't a total waste of

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.450 
so I guess it wasn't a total waste of
time<00:00:44.480> I<00:00:44.750> did<00:00:45.500> manage<00:00:45.710> to<00:00:45.920> finish<00:00:46.100> the<00:00:46.280> left

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
time I did manage to finish the left

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.340 
time I did manage to finish the left
control<00:00:46.760> handle<00:00:47.030> though<00:00:47.150> I<00:00:47.390> paying<00:00:48.050> the<00:00:48.200> wire

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
control handle though I paying the wire

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:49.870 
control handle though I paying the wire
cap<00:00:48.620> black<00:00:48.830> because<00:00:49.190> the<00:00:49.280> plus<00:00:49.490> it<00:00:49.640> would<00:00:49.760> get

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:49.880 
cap black because the plus it would get

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.270 
cap black because the plus it would get
dirty<00:00:50.120> every<00:00:50.360> time<00:00:50.540> it<00:00:50.660> was<00:00:50.780> touched<00:00:50.990> I<00:00:51.280> then

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
dirty every time it was touched I then

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.680 
dirty every time it was touched I then
wrapped<00:00:52.520> the<00:00:52.610> handle<00:00:52.970> with<00:00:53.060> a<00:00:53.120> rubber<00:00:53.270> tape<00:00:53.570> I

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
wrapped the handle with a rubber tape I

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.140 
wrapped the handle with a rubber tape I
had<00:00:53.810> lying<00:00:54.050> around<00:00:54.580> adjustable<00:00:55.580> control<00:00:55.940> rod

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:56.150 
had lying around adjustable control rod

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:57.640 
had lying around adjustable control rod
months<00:00:56.510> to<00:00:56.630> the<00:00:56.720> lower<00:00:56.900> part<00:00:57.200> of<00:00:57.230> the<00:00:57.290> handle

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:57.650 
months to the lower part of the handle

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.470 
months to the lower part of the handle
so<00:00:58.400> I<00:00:58.430> don't<00:00:58.610> step<00:00:58.790> on<00:00:58.880> my<00:00:59.000> handles<00:00:59.330> when

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
so I don't step on my handles when

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.180 
so I don't step on my handles when
getting<00:00:59.720> out<00:01:00.020> of<00:01:00.110> the<00:01:00.170> tank<00:01:00.440> and<00:01:00.680> made<00:01:01.040> them
