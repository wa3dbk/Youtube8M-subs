00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 welcome to a new video tutorial of 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.569
 photograph if what you want to do is a 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.030
 color temperature balance in 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.790
 a photograph as we see in this 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.520
 example 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:16.840
 before and after they do not take off because 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.840
 let's start right now 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.410
 ah 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:31.420
 ok we realize that we 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:33.070
 when we take a picture and good 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.920
 this example is more dedicated to the 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.949
 compact digital cameras these 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:42.699
 cameras do not have a balance of 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:44.800
 temperature or a white setting where 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:46.750
 we can tell our 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.760
 camera with what intensity or with what 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:52.480
 temperature we want to take our 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:55.210
 photography and good obviously this guy 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.030
 of temperature us good at 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:01.570
 photography is going to be eliminated as is 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:04.479
 calling as degrees kelvin and this 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.190
 type of temperature what it tells us is 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.490
 How is our photo going to be? 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:11.770
 stay with the colors somewhat 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.799
 saturated somewhat normal with a 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.780
 balance if it's cold if our if 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:19.330
 our photography is going to be cold 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.140
 warm with your shape this is not 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.330
 interior lighting and so on 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.490
 the problem with these digital cameras 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.460
 compact as I had already told you is that 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.229
 they do not have a way to personalize their 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.700
 color temperature at the time of taking 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.880
 a photo and this time we give ourselves 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:39.479
 notice that it is a problem because of either 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.640
 the by some light bulb that is enough 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.790
 lighting or because the place is very 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.040
 closed or by some or by some bounce 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.729
 of flash although the bounce or flash is not 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.830
 so being so is not so analyzed in 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.860
 this case because they are not so bright 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:59.970
 people but to the point is that 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.710
 this is because of the temperature of 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.509
 color what we're going to do in this 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.840
 scott simple tutorial how 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.820
 process it in some kind of software 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.670
 for photography and what we are going to do 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:15.330
 is that temperature setting 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:19.810
 this time we are going to use software 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:22.810
 called adolf photoshop lightroom voucher 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.459
 I have version 4, let's open it 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.090
 can use with any kind of 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:29.260
 version is equal good something to append 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.000
 is that we can also do it in 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.849
 photoshop we can do it in upper hutt 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.099
 for mac we can do it in camera raw 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:38.680
 we can do it in too much state 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:41.110
 photographic revealed part in this 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.160
 occasion we will do it with lightroom we will 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.450
 go file import photos and videos 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.540
 we import our photography that has 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.610
 that bad adjustment we will allocate all 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.880
 let's give you all the pictures to 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.950
 distill all of them and we're going to click on 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:00.090
 to mark it we are going to select the one that 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:04.480
 we want to make the color balance 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:06.940
 let's click on import 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.750
 it is not imported our picture we go to the 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:13.980
 development section 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:16.920
 we click on reveal inside this 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.810
 part let's get to the point to the side 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.100
 right we have a bar called 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.560
 basic 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.930
 we are going to enable it and we have a 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.180
 dropper with this dropper we can 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.500
 work the temperature that we 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.070
 we want and here on the left 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:34.490
 let's see how that adjustment will be 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.880
 our photograph or how would it be 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:39.780
 OK 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:42.180
 the idea is to adjust it to the best color 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.130
 possible that it would come of course 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.280
 a black that the black color say that 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:50.400
 better gives you like that natural look of 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.560
 my picture or we can look for a color like 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:56.340
 Gray style is worth not so black 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:59.340
 but what a little bit so that in 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.020
 this occasion would be this that is 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.770
 gray if we are not comfortable 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:08.040
 let's go with our bar to move the 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:10.500
 temperature in this part is worth if we 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.690
 we realize that if we have an adjustment of 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.570
 a temperature of minus is always a 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.320
 very cold photography but if we go 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:19.800
 for this one 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:22.080
 it is already a photograph let's say it with 

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:27.470
 too much saturation or a 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:29.990
 Photograph that has too much adjustment 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:33.170
 and then we would not be good for that 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:35.570
 side let's work better with our 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:39.560
 temperature bar let's go to the 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:42.950
 site that we better 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:46.010
 we want and here by type we have it 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:48.950
 here if they realize that it's too much 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:52.610
 we're going to lower it a bit we're going to 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:55.569
 leave it I do not know depending on the situation 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:58.719
 obviously each of you will adjust 

00:04:55.569 --> 00:05:01.240
 the temperature of your photography is worth and 

00:04:58.719 --> 00:05:04.360
 we have already done it is very easy 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:07.090
 already you will work the part of 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.710
 here we are going to fix one for a part 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:13.870
 in what is the face of the people 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:17.080
 so that I do not hit that light so hard 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:20.110
 had in that scenario we're going to here because 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:22.320
 let's lower the shadows a little 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:24.500
 let's leave it here 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.729
 I will leave 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:30.279
 a little whites 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:33.509
 and the blacks maybe increase them but a 

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:36.680
 little better we lower them down a bit 

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:39.320
 let's go down the are 7 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:41.090
 and we 're not going to touch almost the 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:43.759
 exposure in contrast since as is 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:46.050
 an interior because it would not come at all 

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:50.650
 favorable 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:52.570
 and after this since to visualize 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:54.900
 our photography in the library we 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:57.750
 we realize that it has already changed a lot 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:06:01.870
 since then we go to the file part 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:03.370
 export we export here we go to 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:05.830
 click to export in the 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:09.420
 desk 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:13.050
 and let's go 

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:15.510
 here to see if I remember we are going to leave it 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:17.090
 here with the normal file name that 

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:21.199
 we want 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:23.600
 let's give him here eye before this 

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:26.630
 let's give it a quality of 100 and a 

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:28.850
 compression format jpg is worth it since 

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:30.919
 our picture is already a jpg point like that 

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:32.750
 that we will not lose more data from the 

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:36.560
 that we have already lost 

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:39.560
 let's now click on export 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:43.220
 we are waiting here and I have done homework 

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:45.080
 and we already have this I think it was going to 

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:48.620
 give him information, let's look at the 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:52.050
 date 6 and 40 is staff and all 

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:55.220
 we have this picture 

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:55.220
 and we have this 

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:01.410
 let's see the before and after coughing 

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:07.190
 and they realize that we've fixed 

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:09.380
 quite our picture and we have for a 

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:11.870
 part arranged light on the other hand 

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:15.740
 we have fixed the color temperature 

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:16.849
 and it's okay in the photo okay I hope that 

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:19.460
 you liked this new video 

00:07:16.849 --> 00:07:22.460
 photography tutorial do not forget

 comment subscribe see you in a 

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:24.970
 next occasion
