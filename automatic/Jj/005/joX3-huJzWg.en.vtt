what apart from the history of the place

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.260 
what apart from the history of the place
actually<00:01:32.860> a<00:01:32.890> great<00:01:33.340> place<00:01:33.610> to<00:01:33.760> come<00:01:33.910> and<00:01:33.970> have

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
actually a great place to come and have

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.420 
actually a great place to come and have
motor<00:01:34.720> racing<00:01:35.380> because<00:01:35.710> it's<00:01:35.890> a<00:01:36.040> track<00:01:36.280> that

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
motor racing because it's a track that

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.210 
motor racing because it's a track that
really<00:01:36.940> lends<00:01:37.240> itself<00:01:37.480> to<00:01:37.870> high<00:01:38.229> speed<00:01:38.680> racing

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
really lends itself to high speed racing

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.240 
really lends itself to high speed racing
yeah<00:01:39.820> it's<00:01:40.210> I<00:01:40.870> think<00:01:41.290> all<00:01:41.410> the<00:01:41.590> drivers<00:01:42.010> are

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:22.920 
the first of the last lap you knew you

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.050 
the first of the last lap you knew you
were<00:04:23.010> not<00:04:23.160> going<00:04:23.310> to<00:04:23.400> win<00:04:23.520> the<00:04:23.640> race<00:04:23.790> because

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.830 
all the guys behind are coming up so
much<00:04:26.520> faster<00:04:26.790> and<00:04:27.180> I<00:04:27.210> think<00:04:27.450> we're<00:04:27.540> gonna<00:04:27.660> see

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
much faster and I think we're gonna see

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.370 
much faster and I think we're gonna see
a<00:04:27.870> lot<00:04:28.290> of<00:04:28.350> that<00:04:28.560> with<00:04:28.770> these<00:04:28.860> cars<00:04:29.190> yeah<00:04:29.730> the

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
a lot of that with these cars yeah the

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.710 
a lot of that with these cars yeah the
way<00:04:31.380> I<00:04:31.410> raced<00:04:31.980> here<00:04:32.160> last<00:04:32.400> in<00:04:32.640> 2005<00:04:33.450> and

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
way I raced here last in 2005 and

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.510 
way I raced here last in 2005 and
obviously<00:04:33.960> I<00:04:34.080> tested<00:04:34.470> the<00:04:34.560> car<00:04:34.740> yesterday<00:04:35.010> and

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
obviously I tested the car yesterday and

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.330 
obviously I tested the car yesterday and
you<00:04:36.360> know<00:04:36.480> there's<00:04:37.380> little<00:04:37.680> few<00:04:37.890> changes<00:04:38.130> in

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
you know there's little few changes in

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.010 
you know there's little few changes in
the<00:04:38.460> circuit<00:04:38.790> in<00:04:38.880> terms<00:04:39.000> of<00:04:39.360> the<00:04:39.480> first<00:04:39.690> corner

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
the circuit in terms of the first corner

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.380 
the circuit in terms of the first corner
heads<00:04:40.170> it's<00:04:40.800> been<00:04:40.980> resurfaced<00:04:41.730> there's<00:04:42.030> f1

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:42.390 
heads it's been resurfaced there's f1

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.210 
heads it's been resurfaced there's f1
curbs<00:04:42.720> on<00:04:42.900> the<00:04:42.990> UI<00:04:43.170> which<00:04:43.380> were<00:04:43.500> quite<00:04:43.710> bad<00:04:43.890> and

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
curbs on the UI which were quite bad and

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.540 
curbs on the UI which were quite bad and
big<00:04:44.750> so<00:04:45.750> there's<00:04:46.230> there's<00:04:46.590> less<00:04:46.800> room<00:04:47.220> for

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
big so there's there's less room for

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.840 
big so there's there's less room for
mistakes<00:04:48.680> before<00:04:49.680> we<00:04:50.190> were<00:04:50.340> here<00:04:50.520> if<00:04:50.610> you<00:04:50.700> made

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
mistakes before we were here if you made

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.430 
mistakes before we were here if you made
a<00:04:50.880> mistake<00:04:51.030> and<00:04:51.450> I<00:04:51.540> break<00:04:51.810> yourself<00:04:51.960> even

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
a mistake and I break yourself even

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:57.080 
a mistake and I break yourself even
across<00:04:53.130> the<00:04:55.340> record<00:04:56.340> and<00:04:56.490> kept<00:04:56.669> up<00:04:56.820> with<00:04:56.850> the

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
across the record and kept up with the

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.420 
across the record and kept up with the
pack<00:04:57.330> but<00:04:57.630> know<00:04:57.960> there<00:04:58.290> is<00:04:58.410> there<00:04:58.919> is<00:04:58.980> a<00:04:59.070> chance

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
pack but know there is there is a chance

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.030 
pack but know there is there is a chance
of<00:04:59.669> a<00:04:59.910> breakaway<00:05:00.270> pack<00:05:00.660> and<00:05:01.050> if<00:05:01.470> they<00:05:01.620> get<00:05:01.830> away

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.040 
of a breakaway pack and if they get away

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.909 
of a breakaway pack and if they get away
that's<00:05:02.910> going<00:05:03.210> to<00:05:03.270> become<00:05:03.510> a<00:05:03.540> problem<00:05:03.780> but<00:05:04.230> yes

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:04.919 
that's going to become a problem but yes

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:06.140 
that's going to become a problem but yes
you<00:05:05.010> can't<00:05:05.280> come<00:05:05.490> from<00:05:05.640> the<00:05:05.760> back<00:05:05.910> when<00:05:06.090> I

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
you can't come from the back when I

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.330 
you can't come from the back when I
raced<00:05:06.450> here<00:05:06.630> we<00:05:06.780> had<00:05:06.990> we<00:05:07.710> were<00:05:07.860> using<00:05:08.130> on<00:05:08.310> the
