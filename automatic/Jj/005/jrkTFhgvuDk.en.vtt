00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
would expect in a game like this and

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.160 
would expect in a game like this and
they're<00:01:47.310> uniformly<00:01:47.820> good<00:01:48.149> but<00:01:48.659> what<00:01:48.930> I<00:01:48.960> found

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
they're uniformly good but what I found

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.020 
they're uniformly good but what I found
odd<00:01:49.470> was<00:01:49.740> that<00:01:49.979> only<00:01:50.159> one<00:01:50.520> of<00:01:50.549> them<00:01:50.790> that<00:01:51.000> I

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
odd was that only one of them that I

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.789 
odd was that only one of them that I
could<00:01:51.270> really<00:01:51.570> tell<00:01:51.960> sounded<00:01:52.500> like<00:01:52.590> they<00:01:52.770> had

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
could really tell sounded like they had

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.590 
could really tell sounded like they had
any<00:01:53.130> type<00:01:53.369> of<00:01:53.399> fairytale<00:01:54.030> connection<00:01:54.509> you

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
any type of fairytale connection you

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.690 
any type of fairytale connection you
would<00:01:54.720> expect<00:01:55.049> for<00:01:55.500> example<00:01:55.590> frogs<00:01:56.189> talk<00:01:56.520> like

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
would expect for example frogs talk like

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.490 
would expect for example frogs talk like
normal<00:01:56.729> dudes<00:01:57.270> even<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.600> flying<00:01:57.810> monkey<00:01:58.049> sounds

normal dudes even a flying monkey sounds

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.469 
normal dudes even a flying monkey sounds
rather<00:01:58.649> mundane<00:01:58.920> then<00:01:59.700> a<00:01:59.729> particular<00:02:00.030> pig

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
rather mundane then a particular pig

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.569

shows<00:02:00.750> up<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:01.140> steals<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.530> show<00:02:01.560> not<00:02:02.280> because

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
shows up and steals the show not because

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:03.740 
shows up and steals the show not because
the<00:02:02.700> fuckers<00:02:03.000> walling<00:02:03.299> around<00:02:03.479> in<00:02:03.570> his<00:02:03.630> own

shit<00:02:04.049> throughout<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.439> scene<00:02:04.619> but<00:02:04.770> actually

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
shit throughout the scene but actually

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.289 
shit throughout the scene but actually
because<00:02:05.189> they<00:02:05.460> mixed<00:02:05.790> in<00:02:05.909> some<00:02:06.119> of<00:02:06.210> the

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
because they mixed in some of the

smallest of animal sounds it really made

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.699 
smallest of animal sounds it really made
me<00:02:08.819> notice<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.330> lack<00:02:09.479> of<00:02:09.509> layering<00:02:09.929> elsewhere

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
me notice the lack of layering elsewhere

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.020 
me notice the lack of layering elsewhere
close<00:02:10.950> your<00:02:11.129> eyes<00:02:11.250> and<00:02:11.550> only<00:02:11.700> two<00:02:11.849> characters
