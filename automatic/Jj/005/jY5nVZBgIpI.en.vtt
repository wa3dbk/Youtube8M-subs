00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
pre-installed on to the tablet the great

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.220 
pre-installed on to the tablet the great
thing<00:01:28.230> about<00:01:28.470> this<00:01:28.650> tablet<00:01:29.460> screen<00:01:30.060> is<00:01:30.930> that

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:31.230 
thing about this tablet screen is that

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.530 
thing about this tablet screen is that
it's<00:01:31.380> slightly<00:01:31.650> wider<00:01:32.010> than<00:01:32.190> say<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.550> pipo<00:01:33.090> m2

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
it's slightly wider than say the pipo m2

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.720 
it's slightly wider than say the pipo m2
so<00:01:34.260> you<00:01:34.320> don't<00:01:34.500> get<00:01:34.620> any<00:01:34.770> as<00:01:35.040> much<00:01:35.370> of<00:01:35.610> the

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:35.730 
so you don't get any as much of the

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.900 
so you don't get any as much of the
black<00:01:36.000> on<00:01:36.810> top<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.410> the<00:01:37.470> bottom<00:01:37.830> so<00:01:38.670> it<00:01:38.700> looks

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:38.910 
black on top of the bottom so it looks

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.910 
black on top of the bottom so it looks
great<00:01:39.120> when<00:01:39.300> you're<00:01:39.420> watching<00:01:40.310> 1080<00:01:41.310> videos
