you'll bring the club back you'll try

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.950

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
but your body never really ever follows

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.040 
but your body never really ever follows
through<00:02:10.979> with<00:02:11.220> what<00:02:11.580> actually<00:02:12.540> sends<00:02:12.900> the

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
through with what actually sends the
