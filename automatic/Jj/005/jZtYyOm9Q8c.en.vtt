00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
not enveloped himself in real sinful

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.360 
not enveloped himself in real sinful
human<00:00:32.879> flesh<00:00:33.210> we<00:00:34.199> saw<00:00:34.440> that<00:00:34.650> Paul<00:00:34.949> and<00:00:34.980> the

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
human flesh we saw that Paul and the

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.580 
human flesh we saw that Paul and the
early<00:00:35.640> Christians<00:00:36.120> felt<00:00:36.809> that<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.170> human

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
early Christians felt that the human

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.350 
early Christians felt that the human
flesh<00:00:37.949> the<00:00:38.280> very<00:00:38.520> body<00:00:38.910> of<00:00:39.890> men<00:00:40.890> was<00:00:41.820> sinful

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
flesh the very body of men was sinful

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.900 
flesh the very body of men was sinful
innately<00:00:43.320> sinful<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.280> reason<00:00:44.699> for<00:00:44.730> that

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
innately sinful and the reason for that

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.110 
innately sinful and the reason for that
is<00:00:45.239> because<00:00:45.750> of<00:00:46.199> original<00:00:46.830> sin<00:00:47.100> so<00:00:47.970> they

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
is because of original sin so they

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.270 
is because of original sin so they
couldn't<00:00:48.360> possibly<00:00:49.050> have<00:00:49.260> thought<00:00:49.500> Jesus<00:00:50.010> had

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
couldn't possibly have thought Jesus had

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.420 
couldn't possibly have thought Jesus had
been<00:00:51.030> born<00:00:51.360> of<00:00:51.630> a<00:00:51.720> sinful<00:00:52.170> woman<00:00:53.600> we<00:00:54.600> saw<00:00:54.840> this

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
been born of a sinful woman we saw this

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:01.130 
been born of a sinful woman we saw this
idea<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.730> becoming<00:00:58.040> like<00:00:59.040> a<00:00:59.340> man<00:00:59.760> in<00:01:00.140> the

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
idea of becoming like a man in the

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.440 
idea of becoming like a man in the
Ascension<00:01:01.590> of<00:01:01.649> Isaiah<00:01:02.129> where<00:01:02.460> Jesus<00:01:02.850> descends

through<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.809> levels<00:01:04.170> of<00:01:04.290> heaven<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:05.460> take<00:01:05.700> on

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
through the levels of heaven to take on

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.300 
through the levels of heaven to take on
more<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.390> more<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:07.410> appearance<00:01:07.740> of<00:01:07.979> a<00:01:08.100> man

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
more and more the appearance of a man

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.330 
more and more the appearance of a man
and<00:01:08.640> we<00:01:09.479> saw<00:01:09.660> the<00:01:09.720> phrase<00:01:10.110> they<00:01:10.590> will<00:01:10.830> think<00:01:11.160> he

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
and we saw the phrase they will think he

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.310 
and we saw the phrase they will think he
is<00:01:11.369> flesh<00:01:11.940> and<00:01:12.050> a<00:01:13.050> man<00:01:13.940> to<00:01:14.940> me<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.360> has<00:01:16.110> to

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
is flesh and a man to me that has to

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.730 
is flesh and a man to me that has to
mean<00:01:16.470> that<00:01:16.530> Jesus<00:01:17.190> wasn't<00:01:17.640> an<00:01:18.090> actual<00:01:18.509> man<00:01:19.020> he

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
mean that Jesus wasn't an actual man he

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.180 
mean that Jesus wasn't an actual man he
merely<00:01:20.190> looked<00:01:20.970> like<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.300> man<00:01:21.660> and<00:01:21.950> this<00:01:22.950> was

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190 
merely looked like a man and this was

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.779 
merely looked like a man and this was
enough<00:01:23.550> for<00:01:23.819> the<00:01:24.209> demons<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.840> kill<00:01:25.110> him<00:01:25.319> and<00:01:25.789> we

00:01:26.779 --> 00:01:26.789 
enough for the demons to kill him and we

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:29.029 
enough for the demons to kill him and we
saw<00:01:27.000> corroboration<00:01:27.660> that<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.200> demons<00:01:28.440> were

00:01:29.029 --> 00:01:29.039 
saw corroboration that the demons were

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:32.120 
saw corroboration that the demons were
the<00:01:29.190> one<00:01:29.399> who<00:01:29.429> killed<00:01:29.970> Jesus<00:01:30.750> because<00:01:31.170> the

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
the one who killed Jesus because the

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.330 
the one who killed Jesus because the
Romans<00:01:32.670> nor<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.450> Jews<00:01:33.750> would<00:01:34.679> have<00:01:34.830> killed

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
Romans nor the Jews would have killed

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.449 
Romans nor the Jews would have killed
Jesus<00:01:35.849> just<00:01:36.179> because<00:01:36.569> he<00:01:36.690> looked<00:01:36.959> human<00:01:37.229> but

00:01:37.449 --> 00:01:37.459 
Jesus just because he looked human but

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:40.370 
Jesus just because he looked human but
that<00:01:38.459> was<00:01:38.670> good<00:01:38.849> enough<00:01:39.149> that<00:01:40.020> was<00:01:40.170> a<00:01:40.200> good

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
that was good enough that was a good

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.139 
that was good enough that was a good
enough<00:01:40.590> reason<00:01:40.709> for<00:01:41.039> the<00:01:41.220> demons<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.789> killing

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 
enough reason for the demons to killing

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:46.699 
enough reason for the demons to killing
and<00:01:43.729> inadvertently<00:01:44.729> by<00:01:45.330> killing<00:01:45.750> him<00:01:45.869> they

and inadvertently by killing him they

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:50.059 
and inadvertently by killing him they
instigated<00:01:47.459> God's<00:01:47.670> plan<00:01:48.000> of<00:01:48.030> salvation<00:01:49.069> so
