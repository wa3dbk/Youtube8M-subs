00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 but there is a canned dairy product that 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.580
 Hold in good condition in the closet 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.460
 much longer than most 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.460
 foods 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:12.380
 the company calloway andina wisconsin 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:16.130
 store a lot of milk to be able to make 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:18.349
 some very special products both 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:21.500
 large tanks that we see there have a 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:23.240
 capacity of 227 thousand liters each with 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.790
 that amount we could offer a glass 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.649
 of milk to a million people one of 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:29.329
 The main product lines of 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:32.680
 galloway is condensed milk 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:35.020
 sugar for the food industry 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:38.510
 condensed milk can be used 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:40.489
 to sweeten all kinds of recipes 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.769
 raw milk that stores galloway 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:46.149
 passes through a centrifugal separator for 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:46.149
 isolate the skim part 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.150
 the next step is a process that 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.420
 eliminates 70% of the water in the milk 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.370
 skim 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.980
 all that happens within this 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:01.100
 impressive tube system called 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.769
 reverse osmosis filter 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.710
 high-pressure pumps push the 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:08.890
 skim milk towards the tubes in the 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.060
 inside of the tubes there are some membranes 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.970
 semipermeable consisting of layers 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.370
 Molecular size pore multiples 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.050
 the molecules of milk are too 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.420
 big to penetrate those layers 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.760
 but the water molecules are more 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.190
 small and if they can go through and 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.170
 get to the heart of the membrane 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.150
 and the filtered water comes out through one of the 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.850
 ends of each tube before being 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.890
 ejected milk system 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.660
 concentrated flows into a tank of 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.970
 mixed where it is mixed with cream and 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:41.250
 liquid sugar that helps preserve 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:44.130
 milk and add the desired sweetness 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.050
 this new mixture will be pasteurized and 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.860
 then it will go through a giant evaporator 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.479
 to eliminate all the additional water 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.940
 behind me is the evaporator of the 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.710
 Calloway company we basically take 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.750
 a mixture of milk and sugar and the air 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.160
 themselves to eliminate part of the water and 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.160
 concentrate more the mixture 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.240
 the evaporator consists of a series of 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.429
 towers called calandrias 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.800
 the milk enters through the top of 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.690
 each calandria and descends for several 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.360
 small stainless steel tubes 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:20.070
 the steam that surrounds each tube boils 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.070
 the milk as it falls 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.310
 in the lower part the steam and milk 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.959
 concentrated flow towards a separator 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.450
 where the steam comes out 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:33.780
 superior and milk is pumped to the 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.940
 next calandria the process repeats 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.560
 several times until all is removed 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.560
 the water of the condensed formula 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:44.590
 finally the milk reaches some tanks 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:46.209
 of storage this milk is 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.180
 destined to become an authentic 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:50.499
 sugary candy although nowadays there is 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.319
 a large consumption of condensed milk 

00:02:50.499 --> 00:02:56.049
 sweetened the revolutionary idea will be 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:58.620
 it happened 150 years ago to gale borden 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:01.209
 founder of the board in milk company 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.340
 game solves the difficult problem of 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:06.219
 preservation of milk before the era 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.719
 of refrigeration that could keep 

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:10.180
 milk and keep it in a can 

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:12.129
 for a long time milk borden 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.530
 could last at least one year within the 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:16.120
 can so it became a 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.879
 very valuable product for soldiers 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.620
 of the war of secession of the USA that 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:23.639
 they fought on battlefields in the 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.639
 that there were no dairy cows 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.849
 in the 1920s the workers of 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.920
 the company carnation milk conserved 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:34.530
 the milk in another way this time without 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.269
 sugar after evaporating the water from the milk 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.870
 some machines inject the milk in a 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:41.519
 can then seal it and heat it up 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.409
 evaporated milk like sweetened milk 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:46.459
 of borden could last more than a year 

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:46.459
 before spoiling
