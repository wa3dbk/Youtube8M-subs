00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 welcome everyone to a new video 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.529
 of aigÃ¼es interest I am the magician in this 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.710
 small occasion I bring you a tutorial 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.230
 so you can load your 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.690
 device on the computer when 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.779
 disappear the message that you are not 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.080
 loading not obviously this tutorial is 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:25.949
 only for those who try to charge 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.859
 your device directly to the 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.470
 computer but good before you start 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.740
 we go with the new introduction and now 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.740
 we came 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.890
 the problem of the following here as 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:57.600
 can see I do not know if they can see the cable 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:01:00.820
 is connected from the cpu obviously 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:04.000
 until the device not when we 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:08.230
 we approach the device we get a 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.350
 error saying that it is not loading 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:13.630
 no then it 's a small one it's not a 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.810
 small mistake but what happens in 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:19.210
 this case is that the usb ports do not 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.550
 they have enough charge to 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.610
 charge the device do not need 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:27.340
 let's say a higher voltage power like 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:31.260
 they want to call it even worth anything 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:34.670
 that I unplug the cable 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.670
 and I reconnect 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:44.120
 because as you can see it still follows 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:46.550
 with the legend that you are not 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:50.840
 loading now well to solve this 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:53.320
 problem is fundamental to go to the 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.090
 computer not 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.180
 play guys already once here in the 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.950
 computer are going to the description of the 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.620
 very important video I'm going to leave you 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.360
 a file in the description so that 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:07.060
 you download it or that people who 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.640
 is here not then we what 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.290
 let's do is extract this file 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.160
 but I recommend that you first believe 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:17.170
 a folder give you right button again 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.270
 folder and they put any name 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.490
 then in this case 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.130
 as we do not have much new imagination 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.670
 folder then we open the file that 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:30.480
 we have downloaded 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.760
 we give it to extract in and we select the 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.620
 folder that we have created we give to 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.660
 to accept 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.610
 We hope to load and ready and this 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.959
 file that we download what we can 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.780
 remove 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.750
 now let's open the folder that 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.760
 we want 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:49.630
 created with the files that we have 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:53.050
 extracted and we're going to open up the sector the 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:55.570
 sector that is this that is here not that 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.700
 says that cap is the only one that is the 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:00.630
 only installation file there is no 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.910
 then we open the sector 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.980
 and we must install this program 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:08.280
 We give below and wait for 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.020
 load all this process and we will 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.720
 ask to restart the computer to 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:15.660
 let's say save the changes in this case 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:19.830
 we are not going to restart it because it does not 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:22.620
 missing for the changes to be seen 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:26.190
 but then what has been the 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:29.040
 tablet or the device can already be 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:31.740
 load comfortably now well if not 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.750
 charge them then restart your computer and 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:36.750
 reconnect your device to the 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.700
 pc if you want to load in this way and 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.760
 already the problem should be solved 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:44.820
 we go again with the camera so that 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.800
 see what I'm talking about very well 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.150
 guys how can I see what barely 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.740
 I just did is restart the 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.800
 computer so that the changes are 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.600
 effect correctly is not called 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.390
 wait here for it to restart and when 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.330
 we have them started, we continue to 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.640
 video 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:05.300
 although good and here the pc restarts 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:09.230
 once it is restarted you will 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:12.710
 create an icon in the taskbar that 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.990
 is that which is there can not be seen with 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:16.940
 an X because that is the icon that 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:19.820
 he creates us on the computer when 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.620
 that X appears on that icon wants 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.780
 say that the device is not being 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:27.110
 loading anyway to verify 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:32.050
 we're going to see the device we're going to 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:32.050
 come a little closer and let's start it 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.020
 here as you can see it still follows 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.819
 saying that it is not charging us 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.880
 do not worry what they have to do 

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:43.710
 is to disconnect the cable and return it to 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.949
 connect let's unlock the 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.949
 device 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.810
 to notice when we disconnect it 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.180
 and we'll see you connect 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:07.590
 effectively there begins to load 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:11.129
 if you are watching it is connected 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:12.569
 directly to the computer and good 

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:13.879
 I video guys take - up 

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:16.500
 I hope you liked it here 

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:19.949
 Remember, the emission is very important 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.659
 of the video to download the file and 

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:22.919
 Well, nothing, I'm the most goals of today 

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:24.180
 video up here remember to follow me 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:25.800
 through social networks itself 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:29.189
 have any doubt 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:32.300
 remember to start and then nothing and we 

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:32.300
 we see and see you soon
