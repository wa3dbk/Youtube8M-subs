00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.760 
empty it might be that some insects have
eaten<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.840> inside<00:01:19.320> of<00:01:19.680> these<00:01:20.430> adults<00:01:21.590> if<00:01:22.590> we

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
eaten the inside of these adults if we

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.670 
eaten the inside of these adults if we
look<00:01:22.950> into<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.549> box<00:01:23.820> we<00:01:24.090> have<00:01:24.119> no<00:01:24.600> sign<00:01:24.930> of

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
look into the box we have no sign of

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.319 
look into the box we have no sign of
Laurie<00:01:26.610> here<00:01:27.500> what<00:01:28.500> we<00:01:28.680> have<00:01:28.860> here<00:01:29.159> is<00:01:29.670> some

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
centipedes are running around here too

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.760 
centipedes are running around here too
so<00:01:41.880> let's<00:01:42.150> see<00:01:42.299> whether<00:01:42.450> we<00:01:42.540> find<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:43.170> lot<00:01:43.740> more

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
so let's see whether we find a lot more

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:50.539 
so let's see whether we find a lot more
inside<00:01:44.520> here<00:01:44.850> I<00:01:48.110> have<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.200> second<00:01:49.560> box<00:01:49.829> that<00:01:50.520> I

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
inside here I have a second box that I

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.340 
inside here I have a second box that I
can<00:01:50.880> check<00:01:51.090> afterwards<00:01:51.720> if<00:01:51.869> we<00:01:51.960> don't<00:01:52.170> find

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
can check afterwards if we don't find

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:01.870 
can check afterwards if we don't find
nothing<00:01:55.350> here

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:11.020 

so<00:02:02.880> look<00:02:03.890> that's<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:05.130> look<00:02:05.280> what<00:02:06.120> we<00:02:06.240> find<00:02:06.479> here

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.039 
box it's it's the clay material on the
bottom<00:03:44.519> of<00:03:44.970> this<00:03:45.600> box<00:03:47.299> so<00:03:48.299> what<00:03:48.480> we<00:03:48.660> can<00:03:48.810> say

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049

together here in a picker box these

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:21.989 
together here in a picker box these
three<00:06:19.710> and<00:06:20.710> see<00:06:20.979> what<00:06:21.129> happens<00:06:21.520> if<00:06:21.639> we<00:06:21.759> feed

three and see what happens if we feed
them<00:06:22.180> regularly<00:06:22.509> now<00:06:23.409> if<00:06:24.249> they<00:06:24.520> still<00:06:24.759> can

00:06:24.929 --> 00:06:24.939 
them regularly now if they still can

00:06:24.939 --> 00:06:29.010 
them regularly now if they still can

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:37.270 
goal you are to tell lives now already

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:39.390 
goal you are to tell lives now already
for<00:06:37.569> two<00:06:37.779> three<00:06:38.199> hours<00:06:38.379> but<00:06:38.710> they<00:06:38.919> don't<00:06:39.159> get

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:39.400 
for two three hours but they don't get

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.360 
for two three hours but they don't get
bigger<00:06:39.699> and<00:06:40.090> they<00:06:40.870> don't<00:06:41.139> seem<00:06:41.379> to<00:06:41.409> go<00:06:41.979> to<00:06:42.039> the

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:42.370 
bigger and they don't seem to go to the

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:45.390 
bigger and they don't seem to go to the
poop<00:06:42.639> on<00:06:42.879> stage<00:06:43.240> so<00:06:44.050> let's<00:06:44.189> make<00:06:45.189> this

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:45.400 
poop on stage so let's make this

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:50.100 
poop on stage so let's make this
experiment<00:06:45.849> here<00:06:46.439> with<00:06:47.439> these<00:06:47.650> three<00:06:49.110> call

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:50.110 
experiment here with these three call

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:52.350 
experiment here with these three call
the<00:06:50.229> autos<00:06:50.620> and<00:06:50.949> then<00:06:51.159> we<00:06:51.339> will<00:06:51.490> come<00:06:51.789> back<00:06:51.819> and

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:52.360 
the autos and then we will come back and

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:57.929 
the autos and then we will come back and
see<00:06:52.740> what<00:06:53.740> happens<00:06:54.189> and<00:06:56.310> of<00:06:57.310> course<00:06:57.610> then<00:06:57.909> I

00:06:57.929 --> 00:06:57.939 
see what happens and of course then I

00:06:57.939 --> 00:07:00.510 
see what happens and of course then I
give<00:06:58.900> them<00:06:59.080> some<00:06:59.319> of<00:06:59.349> the<00:06:59.740> also<00:07:00.189> what<00:07:00.370> you<00:07:00.490> can

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:00.520 
give them some of the also what you can

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:07.679 
give them some of the also what you can
give<00:07:00.879> with<00:07:01.060> some<00:07:01.300> of<00:07:01.449> them<00:07:02.339> of<00:07:06.689> pellets

00:07:07.679 --> 00:07:07.689 
give with some of them of pellets

00:07:07.689 --> 00:07:13.529 
give with some of them of pellets
pelletized<00:07:09.000> manure<00:07:10.000> of<00:07:10.300> cows<00:07:11.669> this<00:07:12.669> also<00:07:12.939> can

00:07:13.529 --> 00:07:13.539 
pelletized manure of cows this also can

00:07:13.539 --> 00:07:15.029 
pelletized manure of cows this also can
be<00:07:13.599> something<00:07:14.050> that<00:07:14.349> they<00:07:14.500> like<00:07:14.680> at<00:07:14.919> the

00:07:15.029 --> 00:07:15.039 
be something that they like at the

beginning or kind of this dog food or
cat<00:07:20.020> food<00:07:20.349> material<00:07:21.219> on<00:07:21.370> the<00:07:21.520> top<00:07:22.229> and<00:07:23.229> then

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:23.710 
cat food material on the top and then

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:25.850 
cat food material on the top and then
let's<00:07:24.339> see<00:07:24.490> what<00:07:24.639> they<00:07:24.789> do<00:07:24.849> whether<00:07:25.180> they<00:07:25.389> can

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:25.860 
let's see what they do whether they can

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:31.429 
let's see what they do whether they can
recover<00:07:27.240> from<00:07:28.409> there<00:07:29.409> practically<00:07:30.250> one<00:07:30.520> year

00:07:31.429 --> 00:07:31.439 
recover from there practically one year

00:07:31.439 --> 00:07:47.399 
recover from there practically one year
sitting<00:07:32.439> in<00:07:32.800> this<00:07:32.979> box<00:07:33.279> or<00:07:33.789> not
