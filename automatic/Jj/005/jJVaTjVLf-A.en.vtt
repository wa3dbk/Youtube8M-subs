something enjoyable in this anime but
either<00:01:09.960> way<00:01:10.200> I<00:01:10.470> guess<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.549> standpoint<00:01:12.150> I

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
either way I guess and a standpoint I

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.929 
either way I guess and a standpoint I
still<00:01:12.630> cannot<00:01:12.930> recommend<00:01:13.260> this<00:01:13.560> series<00:01:13.909> but<00:01:14.909> I

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
I've been meaning to say that I mean in

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.420 
I've been meaning to say that I mean in
the<00:01:33.990> first<00:01:34.229> episode<00:01:34.950> they<00:01:35.100> looked<00:01:35.280> like

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
the first episode they looked like

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.950 
the first episode they looked like
freakin<00:01:35.729> philosoraptor<00:01:36.270> z'<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.600> this<00:01:36.810> one

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
freakin philosoraptor z' and this one

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.510 
freakin philosoraptor z' and this one

but<00:01:38.790> either<00:01:39.329> way<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:39.960> guess<00:01:40.619> it<00:01:41.369> was<00:01:41.549> an<00:01:41.670> average

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
but either way I guess it was an average

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.609 
but either way I guess it was an average
episode<00:01:42.390> for<00:01:42.540> this<00:01:42.689> anime<00:01:42.990> season<00:01:43.200> it<00:01:43.409> was
