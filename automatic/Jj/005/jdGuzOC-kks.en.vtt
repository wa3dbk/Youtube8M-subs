adding<00:00:08.130> registry<00:00:08.760> keys<00:00:09.000> remotely<00:00:09.690> with<00:00:10.139> the

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
adding registry keys remotely with the

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.390 
adding registry keys remotely with the
government<00:00:10.740> remote<00:00:11.190> administration<00:00:11.309> suite

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:13.400 
government remote administration suite

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.220 
government remote administration suite
we'll<00:00:14.400> begin<00:00:14.549> by<00:00:14.880> adding<00:00:15.120> a<00:00:15.330> new<00:00:15.450> scope<00:00:15.690> action

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:18.230 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.070 

in<00:00:19.230> this<00:00:20.039> example<00:00:20.939> I'm<00:00:21.270> going<00:00:21.480> to<00:00:21.539> be<00:00:21.600> adding<00:00:22.020> a

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
in this example I'm going to be adding a

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.200 
in this example I'm going to be adding a
registry<00:00:22.560> key<00:00:22.769> that<00:00:23.039> is<00:00:23.640> used<00:00:24.000> by<00:00:24.150> the

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
registry key that is used by the

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.950 
registry key that is used by the
government<00:00:24.630> agents<00:00:26.180> but<00:00:27.180> this<00:00:27.420> really<00:00:27.750> can<00:00:27.930> be

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
government agents but this really can be

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.900 
government agents but this really can be
any<00:00:28.289> registry<00:00:28.800> key<00:00:28.949> you<00:00:29.099> want<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.400> add<00:00:29.519> on<00:00:29.849> your

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
any registry key you want to add on your

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:37.069 
any registry key you want to add on your
target<00:00:30.660> workstations<00:00:35.329> I'm<00:00:36.329> gonna<00:00:36.540> add<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.809> new

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
target workstations I'm gonna add a new

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.400 
target workstations I'm gonna add a new
scope<00:00:37.440> this<00:00:38.129> is<00:00:38.250> where<00:00:38.430> we<00:00:38.550> decide<00:00:39.379> what<00:00:40.379> our

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
scope this is where we decide what our

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.260 
scope this is where we decide what our
target<00:00:40.920> is<00:00:41.010> gonna<00:00:41.070> be<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.700> for<00:00:42.000> this<00:00:42.090> example

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
target is gonna be and for this example

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.810 
target is gonna be and for this example
I'm<00:00:42.719> going<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:42.960> target<00:00:43.140> one<00:00:43.950> specific<00:00:43.980> machine

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
I'm going to target one specific machine

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.139 
I'm going to target one specific machine
that<00:00:45.420> needs<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:45.690> registry<00:00:46.110> key<00:00:46.460> but<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:47.670> can

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
that needs a registry key but you can

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.150 
that needs a registry key but you can
also<00:00:48.710> target<00:00:49.710> multiple<00:00:50.250> machines<00:00:51.800> by<00:00:52.800> adding

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
also target multiple machines by adding

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.639 
also target multiple machines by adding
an<00:00:53.250> ad<00:00:53.430> container<00:00:53.969> an<00:00:54.210> ad<00:00:54.390> site<00:00:54.750> an<00:00:55.020> IP<00:00:55.289> range

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
an ad container an ad site an IP range

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.950 
an ad container an ad site an IP range
or<00:00:55.920> an<00:00:56.010> input<00:00:56.129> file<00:00:56.690> there<00:00:57.690> are<00:00:57.750> several

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
or an input file there are several

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.119 
or an input file there are several
different<00:00:58.320> ways<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.649> add<00:00:58.770> them<00:01:00.770> so<00:01:01.770> now<00:01:01.890> we'll

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
different ways to add them so now we'll

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.549 
different ways to add them so now we'll
add<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.340> new<00:01:02.520> action<00:01:03.239> module<00:01:03.840> this<00:01:04.320> is<00:01:04.409> where

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
add a new action module this is where

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.440 
add a new action module this is where
determine<00:01:05.010> what<00:01:05.369> we<00:01:05.519> want<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.820> do<00:01:05.939> new

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
determine what we want to do new

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.330 
determine what we want to do new
registry<00:01:06.900> action<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.560> in<00:01:07.770> this<00:01:07.920> case<00:01:08.189> we're

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
registry action and in this case we're

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.080 
registry action and in this case we're
going<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.490> be<00:01:08.549> setting<00:01:08.880> a<00:01:08.970> string<00:01:09.299> value<00:01:11.090> here

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
going to be setting a string value here

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.830 
going to be setting a string value here
we're<00:01:12.299> gonna<00:01:12.390> enter<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:13.110> registry<00:01:14.010> key<00:01:14.220> path

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
we're gonna enter the registry key path

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.280 
we're gonna enter the registry key path
so<00:01:15.840> this<00:01:15.960> is<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.290> key<00:01:17.040> path<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.930> value

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
so this is the key path to the value

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.980 
so this is the key path to the value
that<00:01:19.409> we<00:01:19.530> want<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.799> change<00:01:20.040> or<00:01:20.430> add<00:01:20.990> now

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
that we want to change or add now

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.340 
that we want to change or add now
governor<00:01:22.439> will<00:01:22.740> create<00:01:23.689> the<00:01:24.689> registry<00:01:25.170> key

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
governor will create the registry key

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.289 
governor will create the registry key
path<00:01:25.619> if<00:01:25.950> it<00:01:26.250> doesn't<00:01:26.580> exist<00:01:26.729> so<00:01:29.030> it'll<00:01:30.030> create

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
path if it doesn't exist so it'll create

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:36.050 
path if it doesn't exist so it'll create
each<00:01:30.630> key<00:01:31.259> folder<00:01:32.210> that's<00:01:33.210> listed<00:01:34.820> now<00:01:35.820> we're

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
each key folder that's listed now we're

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.270 
each key folder that's listed now we're
going<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.420> give<00:01:36.630> our<00:01:36.840> value<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.200> name<00:01:37.409> in<00:01:37.680> this

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
going to give our value a name in this

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.300 
going to give our value a name in this
case<00:01:38.670> it<00:01:39.000> is<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.570> application<00:01:40.009> central<00:01:41.009> data

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
case it is the application central data

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.990 
case it is the application central data
repo<00:01:42.380> but<00:01:43.380> this<00:01:43.560> could<00:01:43.740> be<00:01:43.860> any<00:01:44.520> value<00:01:44.970> that

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
repo but this could be any value that

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.749 
repo but this could be any value that
you<00:01:45.329> need<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.600> configure<00:01:46.340> this<00:01:47.340> is<00:01:47.579> an

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
you need to configure this is an

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.310 
you need to configure this is an
expandable<00:01:48.240> string<00:01:48.600> so<00:01:48.810> we'll<00:01:48.960> set<00:01:49.140> that<00:01:49.170> to

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
expandable string so we'll set that to

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.210 
expandable string so we'll set that to
true<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:50.420> the<00:01:51.420> value<00:01:51.840> data<00:01:52.229> in<00:01:52.500> this<00:01:52.710> case<00:01:52.770> is

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
true and the value data in this case is

00:01:53.220 --> 00:02:00.090 
true and the value data in this case is
a<00:01:53.750> network<00:01:54.750> share<00:01:55.110> path

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.530 

here's<00:02:01.100> the<00:02:01.340> remote<00:02:01.850> registry<00:02:02.060> of<00:02:02.450> the

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
here's the remote registry of the

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.600 
here's the remote registry of the
machine<00:02:02.870> that<00:02:03.110> we're<00:02:03.230> gonna<00:02:03.350> be<00:02:03.650> adding<00:02:04.460> the

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
machine that we're gonna be adding the

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.390 
machine that we're gonna be adding the
key<00:02:04.820> to<00:02:05.260> and<00:02:06.260> here<00:02:06.500> you'll<00:02:06.620> see<00:02:06.800> we<00:02:06.950> don't<00:02:07.190> have

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
key to and here you'll see we don't have

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:13.360 
key to and here you'll see we don't have
it<00:02:08.619> so<00:02:09.619> we'll<00:02:09.740> click<00:02:09.890> OK<00:02:10.250> click<00:02:11.290> OK<00:02:12.290> again<00:02:12.590> next

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
it so we'll click OK click OK again next

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.050 
it so we'll click OK click OK again next
and<00:02:13.670> finish<00:02:14.890> so<00:02:15.890> now<00:02:16.010> we're<00:02:16.220> going<00:02:16.340> to<00:02:16.460> run

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
and finish so now we're going to run

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.500 
and finish so now we're going to run
this<00:02:17.300> scope<00:02:17.840> action<00:02:18.260> and<00:02:18.970> in<00:02:19.970> running<00:02:20.240> this

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
this scope action and in running this

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.640 
this scope action and in running this
scope<00:02:20.720> action<00:02:22.210> it'll<00:02:23.210> actually<00:02:23.570> process<00:02:24.440> the

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
scope action it'll actually process the

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.190 
scope action it'll actually process the
information<00:02:24.860> and<00:02:25.370> add<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:25.850> registry<00:02:26.240> key<00:02:26.390> so

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
information and add the registry key so

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.020 
information and add the registry key so
here's<00:02:27.410> the<00:02:27.530> remote<00:02:27.740> registry<00:02:28.010> key<00:02:28.550> let<00:02:28.910> me

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
here's the remote registry key let me

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.550 
here's the remote registry key let me
