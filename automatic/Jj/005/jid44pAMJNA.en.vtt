attack and a lot of the other cars have
got<00:05:09.800> a<00:05:09.830> lot<00:05:10.010> of<00:05:10.070> horsepower<00:05:10.400> we<00:05:10.730> know<00:05:10.940> that

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
got a lot of horsepower we know that

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:12.550 
got a lot of horsepower we know that
your<00:05:11.240> power<00:05:11.420> to<00:05:11.570> weight<00:05:11.720> ratio<00:05:11.780> is<00:05:12.230> fairly

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
your power to weight ratio is fairly

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.620 
your power to weight ratio is fairly
good<00:05:12.860> but<00:05:13.340> it<00:05:13.490> you<00:05:13.940> have<00:05:14.180> a<00:05:14.210> personal

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 
good but it you have a personal

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.260 
good but it you have a personal
satisfaction<00:05:14.920> being<00:05:15.920> sort<00:05:16.220> of<00:05:16.280> like<00:05:16.460> a<00:05:16.490> David

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:17.270 
satisfaction being sort of like a David

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:19.600 
satisfaction being sort of like a David
and<00:05:17.330> Goliath<00:05:17.480> situation<00:05:17.900> oh<00:05:18.560> for<00:05:19.250> sure<00:05:19.310> but

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
and Goliath situation oh for sure but

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.280 
and Goliath situation oh for sure but
it's<00:05:19.760> not<00:05:19.850> like<00:05:20.000> we've<00:05:20.150> only<00:05:20.300> got<00:05:20.540> 300<00:05:21.080> or<00:05:21.170> 400

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:21.290 
it's not like we've only got 300 or 400

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:23.290 
it's not like we've only got 300 or 400
horsepower<00:05:21.680> we've<00:05:22.100> got<00:05:22.310> over<00:05:22.460> 500<00:05:22.820> horsepower

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
horsepower we've got over 500 horsepower

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.020 
horsepower we've got over 500 horsepower
so<00:05:24.020> the<00:05:24.710> car<00:05:24.890> weighs<00:05:25.160> two-thirds<00:05:25.850> of<00:05:25.940> what

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
so the car weighs two-thirds of what

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:27.280 
so the car weighs two-thirds of what
there's<00:05:26.240> does<00:05:26.390> so<00:05:26.480> we<00:05:26.570> are<00:05:26.690> slightly<00:05:26.960> down<00:05:27.170> on

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:27.290 
there's does so we are slightly down on

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:28.840 
there's does so we are slightly down on
the<00:05:27.380> power-to-weight<00:05:27.650> ratio<00:05:28.190> but<00:05:28.400> it's<00:05:28.580> um

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:28.850 
the power-to-weight ratio but it's um

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:30.550 
the power-to-weight ratio but it's um
yeah<00:05:29.540> we're<00:05:29.690> proving<00:05:29.810> it<00:05:30.050> you<00:05:30.140> can<00:05:30.320> get<00:05:30.470> it

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.560 
yeah we're proving it you can get it

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.750 
yeah we're proving it you can get it
done<00:05:30.650> with<00:05:30.830> a<00:05:30.860> rear-wheel<00:05:31.130> drive<00:05:31.250> as<00:05:31.490> long<00:05:31.640> as

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:31.760 
done with a rear-wheel drive as long as

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.400 
done with a rear-wheel drive as long as
it's<00:05:31.880> dry<00:05:32.060> we<00:05:32.690> have<00:05:32.810> a<00:05:32.840> strategy<00:05:33.140> for<00:05:33.200> that

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:33.410 
it's dry we have a strategy for that

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:34.990 
it's dry we have a strategy for that
next<00:05:33.590> year<00:05:33.860> we're<00:05:34.010> traction<00:05:34.370> control<00:05:34.490> and<00:05:34.910> a

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 
next year we're traction control and a

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.640 
next year we're traction control and a
bit<00:05:35.120> of<00:05:35.150> aero<00:05:35.330> package<00:05:35.570> package<00:05:36.200> room<00:05:36.500> it's

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:36.650 
bit of aero package package room it's

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.490 
bit of aero package package room it's
wet<00:05:36.860> but<00:05:37.100> I<00:05:37.550> know<00:05:37.790> it's<00:05:38.210> a<00:05:38.270> good<00:05:38.420> mix<00:05:38.540> bunch<00:05:39.350> of

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.500 
wet but I know it's a good mix bunch of

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.360 
wet but I know it's a good mix bunch of
guys<00:05:39.620> and<00:05:40.010> powerful<00:05:40.790> powerful<00:05:40.970> cars
