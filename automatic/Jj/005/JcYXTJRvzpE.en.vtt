00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
okay we have our GoPro camera right here

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.660 
okay we have our GoPro camera right here
you<00:00:03.959> can<00:00:04.080> see<00:00:04.290> that<00:00:04.440> the<00:00:04.680> charging<00:00:05.100> LEDs<00:00:05.490> on

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
you can see that the charging LEDs on

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.940 
you can see that the charging LEDs on
and<00:00:06.480> that's<00:00:06.600> because<00:00:06.960> the<00:00:07.170> receivers<00:00:07.680> turned

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
and that's because the receivers turned

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.500 
and that's because the receivers turned
on<00:00:08.130> which<00:00:08.460> is<00:00:08.670> being<00:00:08.910> powered<00:00:09.179> by<00:00:09.450> this

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
on which is being powered by this

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
background on my monitor you can see

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.350 
background on my monitor you can see
that<00:00:41.309> I<00:00:41.340> have<00:00:41.550> video<00:00:43.700> this<00:00:44.700> is<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:44.910> nice<00:00:45.149> feature

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
that I have video this is a nice feature

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.459 
that I have video this is a nice feature
because<00:00:45.809> it<00:00:45.840> allows<00:00:45.960> someone<00:00:46.500> who<00:00:46.620> flies<00:00:47.090> fpv

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:48.469 
because it allows someone who flies fpv

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:50.779

you can see that it's charging right
here<00:01:28.100> that's<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.280> nice<00:01:29.460> feature<00:01:29.759> again<00:01:30.439> it's

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
here that's a nice feature again it's

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.020 
here that's a nice feature again it's
another<00:01:31.590> option<00:01:32.220> that<00:01:32.250> you<00:01:32.430> can<00:01:32.579> do<00:01:32.759> there's

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
another option that you can do there's

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.770 
another option that you can do there's
not<00:01:33.409> this<00:01:34.409> is<00:01:34.560> all<00:01:34.680> done<00:01:34.950> by<00:01:35.479> soldering<00:01:36.479> in

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
not this is all done by soldering in

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.319 
not this is all done by soldering in
your<00:01:36.900> switch<00:01:37.229> under<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.890> mode<00:01:38.150> grounding<00:01:39.150> it

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
your switch under the mode grounding it

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.740 
your switch under the mode grounding it
and<00:01:39.509> then<00:01:40.200> this<00:01:40.409> is<00:01:40.619> our<00:01:40.799> 5<00:01:41.130> volts<00:01:41.520> in<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:41.970> here

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
and then this is our 5 volts in and here

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.170 
and then this is our 5 volts in and here
is<00:01:42.840> signal<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.470> ground<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:44.180> that's

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
is signal and ground and that's

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.749 
is signal and ground and that's
basically<00:01:45.630> our<00:01:45.899> system<00:01:46.439> as<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:47.280> can<00:01:47.310> see<00:01:47.610> it's

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
basically our system as you can see it's

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.319 
basically our system as you can see it's
a<00:01:47.880> totally<00:01:48.329> closed-loop<00:01:49.079> system<00:01:49.590> there's

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:50.329 
a totally closed-loop system there's

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:53.300 
a totally closed-loop system there's
nothing<00:01:51.329> being<00:01:51.780> hooked<00:01:52.020> up<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.470> our<00:01:52.500> monitor

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
nothing being hooked up to our monitor

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.929 
nothing being hooked up to our monitor
over<00:01:53.549> here<00:01:53.790> and<00:01:54.740> this<00:01:55.740> allows<00:01:55.890> you<00:01:56.280> get<00:01:56.490> live

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
over here and this allows you get live

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.120 
over here and this allows you get live
video<00:01:57.299> for<00:01:58.049> any<00:01:58.200> kind<00:01:58.409> of<00:01:58.439> application<00:01:58.590> you'd

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
video for any kind of application you'd

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.700 
video for any kind of application you'd
want<00:01:59.369> it<00:01:59.460> for
