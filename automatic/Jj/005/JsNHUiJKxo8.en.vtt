00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.860

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:26.619
 automatic 700 shots per minute 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:29.020
 effective in medium and long distances and 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:33.450
 here we see the attachments that I myself 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.450
 I recommend for your use 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:41.700
 and well let's go to the part of the gameplay is 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:45.220

 heaven I do not know I do not remember very well 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:59.830
 and well this is one of the best weapons 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:02.630
 in the package close workers the truth 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.519
 recommends disguising them recommended and 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:08.000
 ximo 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:10.670
 for everyone it is a rifle 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.149
 very effective assault aesthetically looks 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:16.130
 very modern as you can see it has more 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:20.560
 rich the most lateral recoil that 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.560
 vertical so good 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.539
 with a handle everything is solved and 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.630
 good as you can see in the gameplay 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:32.219
 I am using the weapon completely 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.799
 completely choose as it comes from 

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:36.370
 factory without attachments or anything like that 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.650
 good 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:41.560
 I hope that the gameplay is being of his 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.610
 I like it and the truth is that it is very good 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.920
 very good weapon 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:49.300
 It is very easy to use it like almost all 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.300
 quarters weapons 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:56.880
 the level reaches the acr equal to being 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:01.050
 21 that those are the three monsters are 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:04.040
 the three monsters let me tell you they are 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:07.380
 of the best weapons in the 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:10.050
 package and why not also in the game 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.560
 they are the best weapons the truth is 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.810
 that gives and has been worked as they say 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.350
 Spanish has done an excellent job 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:22.250
 in terms of design 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:24.170
 and development of weapons so good 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.910
 They are very easy to use for everything 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.720
 public 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.460
 they kill quite a lot that are very good and 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.820
 good 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:37.190
 maybe not and I do not mention all the 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:40.100
 weapons guides simply want 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:43.460
 comment is because I find I found 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.760
 a space to comment this is 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.099
 guide 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.159
 and good of what this guide will consist of 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:52.799
 I'm going to make this guide with all the 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:58.900
 weapons of the rooms or the scale of 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:03:01.460
 the afternoon 21 the l sad the l 86 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:06.850
 mm 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:06.850
 3 17 m 4 17 sorry 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:17.100
 the other bolt sniper the 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:18.900
 swords 12 and finally the m 5 k 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.930
 well the truth and unlock all the 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.600
 weapons and honestly they are great 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.640
 everyone has their own pros and 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.630
 cons 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.370
 but they are good enough both 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:35.370
 let's say they are all reindeer giving them 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.620
 long in short distances and in 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.940
 any situation are recommendable and 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.310
 more so good 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:45.430
 I recommend that you do the assignments 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:49.150
 to remove them because this yes 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:51.580
 it's worth it as you assign them 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.230
 now they are easier because in the 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.390
 back to karkand package were 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.510
 too difficult to get the 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:02.170
 souls and some of them were not worth the 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.940
 sorry and good I hope the gameplay has 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.730
