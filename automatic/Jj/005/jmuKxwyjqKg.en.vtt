processor I did a little bit of research

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.690 
processor I did a little bit of research
before<00:00:09.469> having<00:00:10.469> my<00:00:10.590> baby<00:00:10.769> shower<00:00:11.099> and<00:00:11.460> having

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
before having my baby shower and having

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.870 
before having my baby shower and having
the<00:00:12.090> baby<00:00:12.240> really<00:00:12.660> and<00:00:13.019> I<00:00:13.440> didn't<00:00:14.370> really<00:00:14.730> just

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
the baby really and I didn't really just

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.430 
the baby really and I didn't really just
want<00:00:15.120> any<00:00:15.330> type<00:00:15.570> of<00:00:15.599> blender<00:00:16.049> I<00:00:16.080> wanted

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
want any type of blender I wanted

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.599 
want any type of blender I wanted
something<00:00:16.710> that<00:00:16.740> could<00:00:16.890> do<00:00:17.100> a<00:00:17.130> little<00:00:17.279> more

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
something that could do a little more

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.849 
something that could do a little more
because<00:00:18.300> really<00:00:18.720> I<00:00:18.750> could<00:00:18.960> just<00:00:19.109> buy<00:00:19.230> any

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
because really I could just buy any

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.630 
because really I could just buy any
blender<00:00:20.340> so<00:00:20.850> I<00:00:20.880> found<00:00:21.359> this<00:00:22.020> one<00:00:22.289> and<00:00:22.609> what<00:00:23.609> I

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
blender so I found this one and what I

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.939 
blender so I found this one and what I
loved<00:00:24.029> about<00:00:24.210> this<00:00:24.630> is<00:00:24.869> that<00:00:25.050> you<00:00:25.199> can<00:00:25.439> steam

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
loved about this is that you can steam

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.939 
loved about this is that you can steam
and<00:00:26.220> blend<00:00:26.789> your<00:00:27.090> items<00:00:27.449> in<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.960> same<00:00:28.260> thing

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
and blend your items in the same thing

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.089 
and blend your items in the same thing
so<00:00:29.730> basically<00:00:30.140> you<00:00:31.140> cut<00:00:31.349> up<00:00:31.439> your<00:00:31.590> fruit<00:00:31.859> your

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
so basically you cut up your fruit your

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.680 
so basically you cut up your fruit your
vegetables<00:00:32.610> whatever<00:00:33.000> you<00:00:33.149> want<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.390> puree

vegetables whatever you want to puree

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.760 
vegetables whatever you want to puree

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
you will place it inside of the process

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.470 
you will place it inside of the process
there<00:00:37.920> aren't<00:00:38.040> any<00:00:38.129> consumed<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.969> fruit<00:00:39.360> or

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
vegetable depending on the softness of

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.569 
vegetable depending on the softness of
the<00:00:41.899> you<00:00:42.899> know<00:00:43.020> some<00:00:43.320> fruits<00:00:43.590> like<00:00:43.800> mangoes

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
the you know some fruits like mangoes

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.520 
the you know some fruits like mangoes
are<00:00:44.730> pretty<00:00:44.910> soft<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.329> puree<00:00:45.989> them<00:00:46.260> maybe

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
are pretty soft you puree them maybe

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.560 
are pretty soft you puree them maybe
with<00:00:46.770> ten<00:00:47.010> minutes<00:00:47.190> of<00:00:47.550> steaming<00:00:47.789> but<00:00:48.180> overall

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
with ten minutes of steaming but overall

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.790 
with ten minutes of steaming but overall
the<00:00:48.719> best<00:00:48.870> thing<00:00:49.140> is<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:49.379> you<00:00:49.440> can<00:00:49.590> press

this<00:01:20.070> cost<00:01:20.460> this<00:01:20.729> was<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:21.030> good<00:01:21.240> overall<00:01:21.750> the

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
this cost this was it good overall the

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.410 
this cost this was it good overall the
size<00:01:22.320> of<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.770> food<00:01:22.950> processor<00:01:23.520> is<00:01:23.729> not<00:01:23.790> bad

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
size of the food processor is not bad

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.830 
size of the food processor is not bad
this<00:01:25.290> is<00:01:25.530> one<00:01:25.830> large<00:01:26.250> mango<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.270> I'll<00:01:27.390> see<00:01:27.630> how

this is one large mango and I'll see how

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.530 
this is one large mango and I'll see how
high<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.170> goes<00:01:28.500> up<00:01:28.829> first<00:01:29.729> off<00:01:29.970> you<00:01:30.180> will<00:01:30.360> need

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
high it goes up first off you will need

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.190 
high it goes up first off you will need
to<00:01:30.659> fill<00:01:32.090> there's<00:01:33.090> an<00:01:33.240> amount<00:01:33.509> that<00:01:33.630> says<00:01:33.810> 60

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
to fill there's an amount that says 60

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.749 
to fill there's an amount that says 60
milliliters<00:01:34.470> I<00:01:34.860> believe<00:01:35.100> now<00:01:35.250> 160

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
milliliters I believe now 160

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.730 
milliliters I believe now 160
milliliters<00:01:36.180> you<00:01:36.720> need<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:36.960> fill<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.229> water<00:01:37.470> to

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
milliliters you need to fill it water to

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.880 
milliliters you need to fill it water to
there<00:01:38.009> then<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:38.850> open<00:01:39.270> this<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.590> that's

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
there then you open this and that's

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.460 
there then you open this and that's
where<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.159> will<00:01:41.280> drain<00:01:41.520> your<00:01:41.700> water<00:01:42.470> now

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
where you will drain your water now

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.950 
where you will drain your water now
after<00:01:43.680> that's<00:01:43.860> done<00:01:44.130> I<00:01:44.399> generally<00:01:45.390> keep<00:01:45.600> water

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
after that's done I generally keep water

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:52.000 
after that's done I generally keep water
in<00:01:46.170> there<00:01:46.290> at<00:01:46.380> all<00:01:46.409> times<00:01:46.799> just<00:01:46.979> so<00:01:47.130> it's<00:01:47.369> quick

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.340 

now<00:01:52.610> a<00:01:52.640> light<00:01:53.120> will<00:01:53.270> light<00:01:53.450> up<00:01:53.600> at<00:01:53.810> the<00:01:54.020> time

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
now a light will light up at the time

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.380 
now a light will light up at the time
period<00:01:54.830> of<00:01:55.010> the<00:01:55.430> steaming<00:01:55.880> that<00:01:56.030> you<00:01:56.210> would

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
period of the steaming that you would

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.570 
period of the steaming that you would
like<00:01:56.600> I<00:01:56.900> think<00:01:57.200> for<00:01:57.620> the<00:01:57.710> small<00:01:57.920> mango<00:01:58.280> we<00:01:58.400> just

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
like I think for the small mango we just

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.760 
like I think for the small mango we just
need<00:01:58.730> ten<00:01:58.940> minutes<00:01:59.270> of<00:01:59.420> steam<00:01:59.720> but<00:02:00.350> I<00:02:00.620> also

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
need ten minutes of steam but I also

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.200 
need ten minutes of steam but I also
want<00:02:01.100> it<00:02:01.220> blended<00:02:01.580> so<00:02:01.760> I'm<00:02:01.880> just<00:02:02.030> going<00:02:02.150> to

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
want it blended so I'm just going to

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:03.940 
want it blended so I'm just going to
press<00:02:02.480> demon<00:02:02.810> blend<00:02:02.990> once<00:02:03.260> for<00:02:03.500> 10<00:02:03.680> minutes

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
press demon blend once for 10 minutes

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.790 
press demon blend once for 10 minutes
and<00:02:04.220> press<00:02:04.400> Start<00:02:04.850> you'll<00:02:05.810> hear<00:02:06.020> a<00:02:06.050> click<00:02:06.470> go

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
and press Start you'll hear a click go

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.670 
and press Start you'll hear a click go
on<00:02:07.010> and<00:02:07.370> then<00:02:07.700> that<00:02:07.880> will<00:02:08.090> flash<00:02:08.390> it<00:02:09.200> can<00:02:09.470> make

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:09.680 
on and then that will flash it can make

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.350 
on and then that will flash it can make
a<00:02:09.710> beeping<00:02:09.980> noise<00:02:10.190> if<00:02:10.580> there's<00:02:10.760> not<00:02:10.880> enough<00:02:10.970> of

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
a beeping noise if there's not enough of

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.880 
a beeping noise if there's not enough of
water<00:02:11.570> in<00:02:11.780> the<00:02:11.900> reservoir<00:02:12.020> to<00:02:12.410> do<00:02:12.740> the

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
water in the reservoir to do the

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.860 
water in the reservoir to do the
steaming<00:02:13.250> so<00:02:13.850> I'm<00:02:14.030> going<00:02:14.180> to<00:02:14.240> come<00:02:14.360> back<00:02:14.510> in<00:02:14.660> 10

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
steaming so I'm going to come back in 10

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.450 
steaming so I'm going to come back in 10
minutes<00:02:14.900> to<00:02:15.350> see<00:02:15.530> when<00:02:15.710> it's<00:02:15.860> about<00:02:16.010> to<00:02:16.160> blend

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
minutes to see when it's about to blend

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:21.130 
minutes to see when it's about to blend
is<00:02:18.130> 1228<00:02:19.130> now<00:02:19.370> so<00:02:19.700> about<00:02:19.910> 12:30<00:02:20.630> a<00:02:20.720> it<00:02:20.930> should

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
is 1228 now so about 12:30 a it should

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:43.199 
is 1228 now so about 12:30 a it should
be<00:02:21.260> good<00:02:21.440> and<00:02:21.710> will

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.940 

okay<00:02:44.209> so<00:02:44.569> that<00:02:44.750> did<00:02:44.959> that<00:02:45.110> all<00:02:45.290> on<00:02:45.379> its<00:02:45.530> own<00:02:45.709> I

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
okay so that did that all on its own I

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.530 
okay so that did that all on its own I
was<00:02:46.069> a<00:02:46.129> little<00:02:46.430> late<00:02:46.580> to<00:02:46.790> catch<00:02:46.970> the<00:02:47.150> blending

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
was a little late to catch the blending

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.449 
was a little late to catch the blending
I<00:02:47.690> just<00:02:47.930> realized<00:02:48.260> the<00:02:48.409> time<00:02:48.620> it<00:02:48.799> was<00:02:48.920> like<00:02:49.370> I

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
I just realized the time it was like I

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:50.890 
I just realized the time it was like I
said<00:02:49.640> before<00:02:49.940> I<00:02:49.970> didn't<00:02:50.269> have<00:02:50.330> to<00:02:50.480> do<00:02:50.599> a<00:02:50.629> thing

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
said before I didn't have to do a thing

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.949 
said before I didn't have to do a thing
as<00:02:51.200> you<00:02:51.769> were<00:02:51.890> watching<00:02:52.069> you<00:02:52.400> probably<00:02:53.030> as<00:02:53.900> you

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
as you were watching you probably as you

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:55.600 
as you were watching you probably as you
were<00:02:54.379> watching<00:02:54.590> before<00:02:55.159> you<00:02:55.310> could<00:02:55.430> probably

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
were watching before you could probably

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.180 
were watching before you could probably
see<00:02:56.150> a<00:02:56.360> few<00:02:56.420> chunks<00:02:57.080> of<00:02:57.319> mango<00:02:57.680> still<00:02:57.950> floating

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
see a few chunks of mango still floating

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.819 
see a few chunks of mango still floating
around<00:02:58.370> so<00:02:59.299> maybe<00:02:59.540> the<00:02:59.810> ten<00:03:00.049> minutes<00:03:00.379> wasn't

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:00.829 
around so maybe the ten minutes wasn't

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:04.350 
around so maybe the ten minutes wasn't
quite<00:03:01.010> enough<00:03:01.310> I<00:03:01.489> can't<00:03:02.269> say<00:03:03.170> it's<00:03:03.500> the<00:03:04.040> best

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
quite enough I can't say it's the best

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.819 
quite enough I can't say it's the best
blender<00:03:05.360> so<00:03:05.720> to<00:03:05.780> speak<00:03:06.049> I've<00:03:06.200> had<00:03:06.409> but<00:03:06.739> then

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:06.829 
blender so to speak I've had but then

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:08.559 
blender so to speak I've had but then
again<00:03:06.950> I've<00:03:07.220> put<00:03:07.549> in<00:03:07.700> fruits<00:03:08.030> and<00:03:08.120> veggies<00:03:08.450> to

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 
again I've put in fruits and veggies to

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:10.390 
again I've put in fruits and veggies to
be<00:03:08.690> steamed<00:03:09.079> in<00:03:09.260> here<00:03:09.440> before<00:03:09.650> blended<00:03:10.220> so

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
be steamed in here before blended so

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.369 
be steamed in here before blended so
maybe<00:03:10.670> I<00:03:10.790> just<00:03:11.030> needed<00:03:11.239> to<00:03:11.420> blasting<00:03:12.260> them<00:03:12.349> a

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:12.379 
maybe I just needed to blasting them a

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:12.970 
maybe I just needed to blasting them a
little<00:03:12.620> longer

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
little longer

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.250 
little longer
pretty<00:03:13.610> much<00:03:13.760> everything<00:03:14.150> I've<00:03:14.510> ever<00:03:14.540> steamed

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
pretty much everything I've ever steamed

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.349 
pretty much everything I've ever steamed
in<00:03:15.410> here<00:03:15.590> has<00:03:15.739> worked<00:03:16.010> out<00:03:16.129> great<00:03:16.489> though

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:17.359 
in here has worked out great though

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:19.990 
in here has worked out great though
carrots<00:03:17.989> were<00:03:18.170> really<00:03:18.500> really<00:03:18.620> hard<00:03:19.010> I<00:03:19.310> didn't

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
carrots were really really hard I didn't

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.610 
carrots were really really hard I didn't
really<00:03:20.390> pay<00:03:20.569> attention<00:03:20.599> to<00:03:21.109> how<00:03:21.260> long<00:03:21.319> I

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
really pay attention to how long I

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.650 
really pay attention to how long I
should<00:03:21.650> steam<00:03:22.040> them<00:03:22.250> I<00:03:22.370> just<00:03:22.400> guessed<00:03:22.879> this

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
should steam them I just guessed this

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.690 
should steam them I just guessed this
does<00:03:23.930> come<00:03:24.170> with<00:03:24.290> a<00:03:24.349> manual<00:03:24.829> that<00:03:25.010> kind<00:03:25.579> of

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
does come with a manual that kind of

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.630 
does come with a manual that kind of
gives<00:03:25.910> you<00:03:26.030> an<00:03:26.120> idea<00:03:26.590> for<00:03:27.590> certain<00:03:28.069> foods<00:03:28.370> how

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
gives you an idea for certain foods how

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.280 
gives you an idea for certain foods how
long<00:03:28.879> you<00:03:29.030> should<00:03:29.090> do<00:03:29.359> it<00:03:29.480> and<00:03:29.629> I<00:03:30.049> have

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
long you should do it and I have

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.649 
long you should do it and I have
misplaced<00:03:30.620> that<00:03:30.859> so<00:03:31.280> who<00:03:31.489> taking<00:03:32.299> a<00:03:32.359> wild

00:03:32.649 --> 00:03:32.659 
misplaced that so who taking a wild

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:34.630 
misplaced that so who taking a wild
guess<00:03:32.840> at<00:03:33.079> 20-25<00:03:33.829> minutes<00:03:34.010> for<00:03:34.250> the<00:03:34.310> carrots

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
guess at 20-25 minutes for the carrots

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.000 
guess at 20-25 minutes for the carrots
still<00:03:35.359> wasn't<00:03:35.720> enough<00:03:35.959> I<00:03:36.230> think<00:03:36.590> I'd<00:03:36.859> rather

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
still wasn't enough I think I'd rather

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.839 
still wasn't enough I think I'd rather
do<00:03:37.400> them<00:03:37.579> on<00:03:37.849> stovetop<00:03:38.629> next<00:03:39.170> time<00:03:39.379> and<00:03:39.849> then

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:40.849 
do them on stovetop next time and then

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:43.839 
do them on stovetop next time and then
blend<00:03:41.180> but<00:03:42.040> overall<00:03:43.040> I'm<00:03:43.280> very<00:03:43.310> very

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:43.849 
blend but overall I'm very very

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:45.309 
blend but overall I'm very very
satisfied<00:03:44.359> with<00:03:44.390> this<00:03:44.659> I<00:03:44.900> think<00:03:45.079> this<00:03:45.170> is<00:03:45.290> a

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:45.319 
satisfied with this I think this is a
