issues that overlap at random times and

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:55.199 
issues that overlap at random times and
it's<00:02:52.659> it's<00:02:53.019> nice<00:02:53.319> to<00:02:53.799> have<00:02:53.920> them<00:02:54.180> separate<00:02:55.180> and

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
it's it's nice to have them separate and

apart<00:02:59.170> they're<00:02:59.409> just<00:02:59.680> not<00:03:00.250> always<00:03:00.639> dealing

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299

much higher up there on the importance
level<00:03:09.730> they<00:03:10.239> are<00:03:10.299> still<00:03:10.540> very<00:03:10.720> important<00:03:11.290> but

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
level they are still very important but

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.410

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
did a really good job with his character

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.360 
did a really good job with his character
because<00:03:29.230> he's<00:03:29.440> definitely<00:03:29.889> going<00:03:30.069> through<00:03:30.310> a

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680

hundred<00:04:01.569> fifty<00:04:02.109> pages<00:04:02.319> were<00:04:02.620> kind<00:04:02.829> of<00:04:02.949> hard<00:04:03.099> to

00:04:03.149 --> 00:04:03.159 
hundred fifty pages were kind of hard to

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:05.069 
hundred fifty pages were kind of hard to
get<00:04:03.340> into<00:04:03.519> but<00:04:04.150> then<00:04:04.329> I<00:04:04.359> would<00:04:04.599> like<00:04:04.720> literally

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.079 
get into but then I would like literally

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:07.349 
get into but then I would like literally
fall<00:04:05.500> asleep<00:04:05.919> with<00:04:06.099> it<00:04:06.250> in<00:04:06.370> my<00:04:06.400> hands<00:04:07.030> in<00:04:07.239> a

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:07.359 
fall asleep with it in my hands in a

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:09.869 
fall asleep with it in my hands in a
good<00:04:07.659> way<00:04:07.840> like<00:04:08.079> I<00:04:08.290> did<00:04:08.590> not<00:04:08.859> stop<00:04:09.250> until<00:04:09.459> my

00:04:09.869 --> 00:04:09.879 
good way like I did not stop until my

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:12.300 
good way like I did not stop until my
brain<00:04:10.180> stopped<00:04:10.659> I<00:04:10.930> actually<00:04:11.409> fell<00:04:11.919> asleep

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
brain stopped I actually fell asleep

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.560 
brain stopped I actually fell asleep
with<00:04:12.940> three<00:04:13.359> pages<00:04:13.750> left<00:04:14.290> major<00:04:14.979> FML<00:04:15.760> moment

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
with three pages left major FML moment

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.599 
with three pages left major FML moment
and<00:04:16.840> then<00:04:16.959> I<00:04:16.989> had<00:04:17.139> to<00:04:17.320> go<00:04:17.349> to<00:04:17.500> school<00:04:17.829> I<00:04:18.159> think

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
and then I had to go to school I think

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:20.339 
and then I had to go to school I think

the universe on my scale I was honestly

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:30.870 
the universe on my scale I was honestly
kind<00:04:29.350> of<00:04:29.500> afraid<00:04:29.740> to<00:04:29.860> start<00:04:30.430> it<00:04:30.580> at<00:04:30.700> first

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
kind of afraid to start it at first

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.270 
kind of afraid to start it at first
because<00:04:31.290> across<00:04:32.290> the<00:04:32.530> universe<00:04:32.800> I<00:04:32.980> couldn't

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
because across the universe I couldn't

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.800 
because across the universe I couldn't
get<00:04:33.430> into<00:04:33.700> it<00:04:33.730> for<00:04:34.030> a<00:04:34.090> while<00:04:34.300> but<00:04:34.600> then<00:04:34.780> I

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
get into it for a while but then I

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.490 
get into it for a while but then I
pushed<00:04:35.230> my<00:04:35.440> way<00:04:35.470> through<00:04:35.890> it<00:04:36.070> and<00:04:36.810> the<00:04:37.810> last

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
pushed my way through it and the last

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.220 
pushed my way through it and the last
half<00:04:38.920> was<00:04:38.950> just<00:04:39.640> fantastic<00:04:40.120> and<00:04:40.750> it<00:04:41.020> was<00:04:41.110> the

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:41.230 
half was just fantastic and it was the

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:43.110 
half was just fantastic and it was the
same<00:04:41.260> way<00:04:41.500> in<00:04:41.830> a<00:04:41.890> million<00:04:42.190> suns<00:04:42.400> I<00:04:42.610> can't<00:04:42.970> even

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120

put<00:04:43.270> my<00:04:43.420> finger<00:04:43.840> on<00:04:43.870> it<00:04:43.990> cuz<00:04:44.320> it's<00:04:44.980> not<00:04:45.130> like

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:45.640 
put my finger on it cuz it's not like

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.690 
put my finger on it cuz it's not like
it's<00:04:45.930> boring<00:04:46.930> it's<00:04:47.140> I<00:04:47.410> just<00:04:47.800> can't<00:04:48.130> really<00:04:48.520> get

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700 
it's boring it's I just can't really get

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.640 
it's boring it's I just can't really get
into<00:04:48.730> it<00:04:49.060> for<00:04:49.300> a<00:04:49.360> little<00:04:49.570> bit<00:04:49.690> but<00:04:50.260> then<00:04:50.440> I<00:04:50.500> do

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
into it for a little bit but then I do

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.980 
into it for a little bit but then I do
and<00:04:51.160> then<00:04:51.280> it<00:04:51.400> ends<00:04:51.820> and<00:04:52.000> shades<00:04:52.570> of<00:04:52.810> Earth

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
and then it ends and shades of Earth

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.590 
and then it ends and shades of Earth
comes<00:04:53.350> out<00:04:53.590> next<00:04:53.860> January<00:04:54.700> so<00:04:55.060> that<00:04:55.300> should<00:04:55.570> be

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 
comes out next January so that should be

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.780 
comes out next January so that should be
interesting<00:04:55.890> there<00:04:56.890> were<00:04:57.010> lots<00:04:57.220> of<00:04:57.520> really

interesting there were lots of really
really<00:04:58.300> really<00:04:58.540> good<00:04:58.900> plot<00:04:59.230> twists<00:04:59.770> there<00:05:00.160> was

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
really really good plot twists there was

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
like four or five split up everywhere

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.030

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:06.040 
there's also no reversible cover like

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.400
