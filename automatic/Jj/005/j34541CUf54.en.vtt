00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:11.670
 to this address seen in the title of 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.200
 Castilla translated into Spanish 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.629
 tuning 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.970
 simple let's start with chords of 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:19.920
 power on the rope 5 and let's drop 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.230
 three power chords fret two of 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.000
 the five elongated rope is worth the 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.339
 third we're going to cut it and we're going to 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.439
 accompany with two quick dry blows 

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:31.199
 Fret two of the rope 5 to make a 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.050
 Quick slide to fret 3 of the agreement to 5 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:37.040
 theory power chord that 's the 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.040
 practice how it would look 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.940
 and three and in this third 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.710
 you see those two taps rope 5 fret 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.710
 two 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.180
 to do is light to the agreed of 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.489
 power fret 3 of the rope 5 and 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.010
 we do the same thing a similar transition 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:07.640
 from the power agreement of the after 3 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:10.570
 string 5 string chord 6 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.570
 after 32 worth 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.470
 you will leave facing death 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:26.310
 and these are frets 32 of the rope 6 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.310
 power agreement 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.960
 and we improve them a bit with a law 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.960
 fast from 5 to 7 and we go fast to 2 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.170
 and how we ended this king later with 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:45.310
 two strokes to 5 2 strokes to 2 2 strokes to 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.310
 5 2 hits to 2 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.860
 this game only does it at the beginning 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:58.680
 In the first the first king of the 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:01.290
 theme as I said the corner ends 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.080
 ok and then only in the first part 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:07.970
 of the flame without copamos chords of 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.970
 power fret two with the six 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.120
 we repeat the game again 5 2 5 2 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.550
 and power chords frets two 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.550
 strings 6 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.930
 and we went down to 1 and into the air 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.050
 you have not seen very simple 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.530
 chorus 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.610
 what we are going to do is again that 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.610
 we have seen at the beginning 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.010
 and again 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.650
 it would splice as we have seen before 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.650
 with this 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.830
 and what happens is that this time 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.840
 syncopated 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.110
 we jump and start directly 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.110
 with the 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:26.580
 well we have already seen almost everything and we are going to 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:29.160
 see the end 'that is an accompaniment 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:32.209
 that is kind of like the chorus 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.209
 then let's start 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:41.520
 power chord fret two strings 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.520
 five various ways to touch it 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.510
 It is worth then this time instead of doing it 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.739
 so long 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.739
 we do not make stronger 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:58.130
 and this one remembered power the only thing 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:00.380
 we do is move finger 4 to fret 5 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.630
 of agreement 3 is worth and then finger 1 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:06.140
 remains on the fret 2 of the rope 5 and the 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:08.390
 finger 3 remains on the 4th fret of the agreement 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.730
 to 4 is worth then we pass a chord 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.650
 normal power to this new chord of 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.040
 power on finger 4 we down a 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.040
 fret 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:22.340
 from here we passed power chord 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:22.340
 fret 345 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:31.070
 and we go back and come back it's the same all 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:33.169
 which is at the beginning we end up with this 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.630
 small contribution with that little 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:37.820
 center in that little novelty when 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.229
 we make the new power chord or 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.930
 be in the variation of the agreement of 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:44.870
 power we do not see finger 4 what's his is 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.820
 what traits also up so that 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:50.050
 be the first note that you touch that of the 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.050
 rope 3 and the diesel 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:56.630
 acute 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:58.610
 there is an effective that make stable key 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:02.350
 and I'll explain how you can get it out 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:06.920
 the notes match the frets 5 3 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:09.790
 10 of rope 1 and 4 of rope 2 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.790
 you can take it out 

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:19.300
 not going is a matter of taking the 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:22.840
 speed 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:25.139
 5 air rope 14 stop is 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:28.680
 saved 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:31.020
 The law keeps one 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.520
 and then each one of the notes you go 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.910
 alternating with the rope one to the air 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.910
 OK 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:43.710
 5 air 4 2 air 3 air 5 al 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:45.000
 air 135 is worth ys 135 you are alternating with 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:48.080
 rope 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.080
 It's a little dragon 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:55.060
 to make a little more interesting 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:55.060
 I hope you liked it 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:03.650
 the tuning and that you like to visit and 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:07.000
 from the sky 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:07.000
 a greeting
