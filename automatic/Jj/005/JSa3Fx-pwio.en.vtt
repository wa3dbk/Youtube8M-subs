00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
gotten grown up in an age now in which

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.919 
gotten grown up in an age now in which
this<00:00:07.529> whole<00:00:07.770> issue<00:00:08.040> of<00:00:08.280> the<00:00:08.370> ego<00:00:08.790> has<00:00:09.630> become

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
this whole issue of the ego has become

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.830 
this whole issue of the ego has become
quite<00:00:10.139> an<00:00:10.410> issue<00:00:10.559> hasn't<00:00:10.950> it<00:00:11.300> and<00:00:12.300> a<00:00:12.450> bit<00:00:12.630> of<00:00:12.780> a

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
quite an issue hasn't it and a bit of a

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.140 
quite an issue hasn't it and a bit of a
struggle<00:00:13.400> switch<00:00:14.400> when<00:00:14.610> you<00:00:14.639> start<00:00:14.940> dealing

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
struggle switch when you start dealing

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.330 
struggle switch when you start dealing
with<00:00:15.480> these<00:00:15.870> ideas<00:00:16.109> as<00:00:16.529> somehow<00:00:16.710> getting<00:00:17.070> rid

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
with these ideas as somehow getting rid

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.200 
with these ideas as somehow getting rid
of<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.550> ego<00:00:18.140> it's<00:00:19.140> simply<00:00:19.470> not<00:00:19.500> possible<00:00:20.210> but

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
of the ego it's simply not possible but

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.580 
of the ego it's simply not possible but
totally<00:00:21.510> should<00:00:21.689> try<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:22.020> do<00:00:22.140> is<00:00:22.289> examine

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
totally should try and do is examine

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.320 
totally should try and do is examine
what<00:00:22.890> an<00:00:23.039> ego<00:00:23.250> is<00:00:23.400> I<00:00:23.789> mean<00:00:24.269> what<00:00:24.420> is<00:00:24.689> it<00:00:25.760> and<00:00:26.760> you

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
what an ego is I mean what is it and you

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.200 
what an ego is I mean what is it and you
will<00:00:27.449> find<00:00:27.779> upon<00:00:28.140> just<00:00:28.970> examination<00:00:29.970> if<00:00:30.119> you

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
will find upon just examination if you

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.620 
will find upon just examination if you
simply<00:00:30.570> look<00:00:30.599> at<00:00:30.960> it<00:00:32.090> the<00:00:33.090> most<00:00:33.270> simple

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
simply look at it the most simple

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.319 
simply look at it the most simple
analogy<00:00:34.170> that<00:00:34.290> we<00:00:34.469> can<00:00:34.680> make<00:00:35.040> with<00:00:35.700> respect<00:00:35.910> to

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
analogy that we can make with respect to

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.560 
analogy that we can make with respect to
what<00:00:36.540> in<00:00:36.690> ego<00:00:37.050> is<00:00:37.370> is<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.610> analogy<00:00:39.120> of<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.270> movie

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
what in ego is is the analogy of a movie

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.530 
what in ego is is the analogy of a movie
projector<00:00:40.550> the<00:00:41.550> point<00:00:41.820> here<00:00:42.059> is<00:00:42.180> that<00:00:42.210> the

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
projector the point here is that the

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.970 
projector the point here is that the
movie<00:00:42.840> projector<00:00:43.410> can<00:00:43.590> have<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:44.989> film<00:00:45.989> you<00:00:46.770> see

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
movie projector can have a film you see

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.880 
movie projector can have a film you see
but<00:00:47.550> if<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:47.760> does<00:00:47.910> not<00:00:47.940> have<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.390> lens<00:00:48.780> we<00:00:49.739> are

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
but if it does not have a lens we are

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.830 
but if it does not have a lens we are
not<00:00:50.129> going<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.489> have<00:00:50.670> an<00:00:50.820> image<00:00:51.120> are<00:00:51.329> we<00:00:51.480> on<00:00:51.690> the

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
not going to have an image are we on the

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.740 
not going to have an image are we on the
screen<00:00:52.430> the<00:00:53.430> film<00:00:53.670> is<00:00:53.850> simply<00:00:54.149> gonna<00:00:54.300> go<00:00:54.480> round

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
screen the film is simply gonna go round

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.529 
screen the film is simply gonna go round
and<00:00:54.930> round<00:00:55.020> around<00:00:55.610> with<00:00:56.610> no<00:00:56.879> image<00:00:57.300> on<00:00:57.449> the

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
and round around with no image on the

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.680 
and round around with no image on the
screen<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:58.050> therefore<00:00:58.410> it's<00:00:58.530> diffuse<00:00:59.600> so<00:01:00.600> the

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
screen and therefore it's diffuse so the

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.689 
screen and therefore it's diffuse so the
point<00:01:00.960> here<00:01:01.079> is<00:01:01.260> that<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.590> lens<00:01:01.829> in<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.399> movie

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
point here is that the lens in the movie

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.270 
point here is that the lens in the movie
projector<00:01:03.300> is<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.690> create<00:01:04.019> an<00:01:04.199> image<00:01:04.589> to

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
projector is to create an image to

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.840 
projector is to create an image to
integrate<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:06.450> focus<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.619> identify<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.670> give

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
integrate to focus to identify to give

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.190 
integrate to focus to identify to give
form<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.890> to<00:01:10.890> give<00:01:11.040> an<00:01:11.159> image<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.810> in<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.930> very

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
form to to give an image to in a very

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.270 
form to to give an image to in a very
same<00:01:13.560> way<00:01:13.770> all<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:14.850> us<00:01:15.000> must<00:01:15.360> have<00:01:15.630> an<00:01:15.960> eagle<00:01:16.290> to

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
same way all of us must have an eagle to

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.450 
same way all of us must have an eagle to
give<00:01:17.460> us<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.790> Celt<00:01:18.540> image<00:01:19.189> they<00:01:20.189> wave

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
give us a Celt image they wave

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.969 
give us a Celt image they wave
integrating<00:01:21.330> on<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.479> conscious<00:01:21.810> level<00:01:22.049> of

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
integrating on a conscious level of

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.999 
integrating on a conscious level of
giving<00:01:23.310> form<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.939> that<00:01:24.090> which<00:01:24.450> you<00:01:24.479> are<00:01:24.770> it<00:01:25.770> is

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
giving form to that which you are it is

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.880 
giving form to that which you are it is
actually<00:01:26.520> necessary<00:01:27.060> isn't<00:01:27.270> it<00:01:27.509> if<00:01:28.380> we<00:01:28.590> didn't

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
actually necessary isn't it if we didn't

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.469 
actually necessary isn't it if we didn't
have<00:01:29.040> it<00:01:29.280> we<00:01:29.460> couldn't<00:01:29.759> even<00:01:29.909> utter<00:01:30.210> her<00:01:30.450> name

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
have it we couldn't even utter her name

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.910 
have it we couldn't even utter her name
could<00:01:30.900> we<00:01:32.090> even<00:01:33.090> your<00:01:33.390> great<00:01:33.600> avatar<00:01:34.259> zebras

could we even your great avatar zebras

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
the restaurant they could not utter

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.749 
the restaurant they could not utter
their<00:01:39.299> name<00:01:39.479> unless<00:01:39.990> they<00:01:40.770> had<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:41.009> conscious

their name unless they had a conscious
focusing<00:01:42.570> agent<00:01:43.079> within<00:01:43.409> their<00:01:43.590> total<00:01:44.040> nature

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
focusing agent within their total nature

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.840 
focusing agent within their total nature
to<00:01:44.579> say<00:01:44.729> I<00:01:44.759> am<00:01:45.119> Jesus<00:01:45.390> I<00:01:45.689> am<00:01:45.810> boat<00:01:46.020> I'm<00:01:46.290> hemella

to say I am Jesus I am boat I'm hemella

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.359 
to say I am Jesus I am boat I'm hemella
you<00:01:47.850> see<00:01:48.000> my<00:01:48.119> point<00:01:48.329> yeah<00:01:48.560> so<00:01:49.560> its<00:01:49.740> artfully

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
you see my point yeah so its artfully

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.120 
you see my point yeah so its artfully
necessary<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:52.110> moon<00:01:52.350> directly

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
necessary and the moon directly

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.889 
necessary and the moon directly
correlates<00:01:53.700> with<00:01:53.939> this<00:01:54.180> thing<00:01:54.390> that<00:01:54.420> you<00:01:54.720> call

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
correlates with this thing that you call

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.800 
correlates with this thing that you call
the<00:01:55.049> eagle<00:01:55.670> so<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.790> point<00:01:57.060> here<00:01:57.180> is<00:01:57.360> that<00:01:57.479> your

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
the eagle so the point here is that your

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.600 
the eagle so the point here is that your
moons<00:01:58.020> gonna<00:01:58.259> have<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.560> house<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.159> sign<00:01:59.340> isn't

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
moons gonna have a house and sign isn't

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.120 
moons gonna have a house and sign isn't
it<00:01:59.960> it's<00:02:00.960> gonna<00:02:01.170> have<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.409> normal<00:02:01.740> axis

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
it it's gonna have a normal axis
