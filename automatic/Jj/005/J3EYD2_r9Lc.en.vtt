&amp; A so let's do it

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.099 
&amp; A so let's do it
how<00:00:12.660> to<00:00:12.719> optimize<00:00:13.440> Wendler<00:00:14.219> 531<00:00:15.000> for<00:00:15.330> naturals

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
how to optimize Wendler 531 for naturals

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.930 
how to optimize Wendler 531 for naturals
let's<00:00:16.710> not<00:00:16.859> use<00:00:16.980> that<00:00:17.130> word<00:00:17.190> optimized<00:00:17.670> let's

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
let's not use that word optimized let's

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.519 
let's not use that word optimized let's
say<00:00:18.150> how<00:00:18.449> do<00:00:18.510> we<00:00:18.690> make<00:00:18.900> sure<00:00:18.930> we<00:00:19.230> get<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.500> best

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
say how do we make sure we get the best

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.250 
say how do we make sure we get the best
protein<00:00:20.039> synthesis<00:00:20.520> because<00:00:20.960> here's<00:00:21.960> a<00:00:22.020> joke

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260

basically written as a bro split you

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.860 
basically written as a bro split you
have<00:00:35.190> an<00:00:35.370> overhead<00:00:35.820> press<00:00:36.180> today<00:00:36.420> an<00:00:36.600> overhead

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
have an overhead press today an overhead

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.690 
have an overhead press today an overhead
press<00:00:37.110> accessory<00:00:37.590> against<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:38.040> bench<00:00:38.579> press

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
press accessory against a bench press

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.780 
press accessory against a bench press
accessory<00:00:39.270> squat<00:00:39.629> they<00:00:40.530> back<00:00:40.980> date<00:00:41.219> it's

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
accessory squat they back date it's

accessory squat they back date it's
basically<00:00:42.559> two<00:00:43.559> different<00:00:43.590> push<00:00:44.100> days<00:00:44.309> one<00:00:44.550> of

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
basically two different push days one of

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.950 
basically two different push days one of
them<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.820> chest<00:00:45.090> day<00:00:45.210> one<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.510> shoulder<00:00:45.809> day

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
them the chest day one the shoulder day

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.690 
them the chest day one the shoulder day
a<00:00:46.640> full<00:00:47.640> day<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.239> legs<00:00:48.480> day<00:00:49.250> so<00:00:50.250> how<00:00:50.489> do<00:00:50.550> you

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
a full day and a legs day so how do you

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.220 
a full day and a legs day so how do you
optimize<00:00:50.879> it<00:00:51.360> with<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.660> way<00:00:51.780> you<00:00:51.840> do<00:00:52.079> your

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
optimize it with the way you do your

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.939 
optimize it with the way you do your
accessories<00:00:53.660> so<00:00:54.660> how<00:00:55.110> do<00:00:55.170> you<00:00:55.350> make<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:55.680> better

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
accessories so how do you make it better

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.950 
accessories so how do you make it better
for<00:00:56.309> total<00:00:56.670> muscle<00:00:56.879> proteins<00:00:57.390> as<00:00:57.539> if<00:00:57.660> this<00:00:57.809> up

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
for total muscle proteins as if this up

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.569 
for total muscle proteins as if this up
time<00:00:58.170> for<00:00:58.350> someone<00:00:58.680> not<00:00:58.829> using<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.219> shitload<00:00:59.550> of

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
time for someone not using a shitload of

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.410 
time for someone not using a shitload of
drugs<00:01:00.140> very<00:01:01.140> simple<00:01:01.620> you<00:01:02.609> turn<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.270> into

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
drugs very simple you turn it into

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.620 
drugs very simple you turn it into
essentially<00:01:03.989> an<00:01:04.260> upper<00:01:04.559> lower<00:01:04.799> I<00:01:05.630> would

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
essentially an upper lower I would

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.620 
essentially an upper lower I would
recommend<00:01:07.380> that<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:08.000> do<00:01:09.000> all<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.330> deadlift

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
recommend that you do all the deadlift

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.330 
recommend that you do all the deadlift
accessory<00:01:10.110> work<00:01:10.320> on<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.590> squat<00:01:10.830> day<00:01:11.040> all<00:01:11.220> the

accessory work on the squat day all the
squat<00:01:11.640> accessory<00:01:12.150> work<00:01:12.299> on<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.570> deadlift<00:01:12.840> day

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
squat accessory work on the deadlift day

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.359

press so that essentially you get two

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.670 
press so that essentially you get two

to get more hamstring feel free to do so

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.030 
to get more hamstring feel free to do so
by<00:01:54.180> customizing<00:01:54.750> your<00:01:54.990> accessory<00:01:55.649> work<00:01:55.890> you

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
by customizing your accessory work you

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.039 
by customizing your accessory work you
can<00:01:56.219> induce<00:01:56.490> additional<00:01:57.049> hypertrophy

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
can induce additional hypertrophy

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.499 
can induce additional hypertrophy
through<00:01:58.409> muscle<00:01:58.829> protein<00:01:59.430> synthesis<00:01:59.939> up<00:02:00.149> time

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
through muscle protein synthesis up time

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.660 
through muscle protein synthesis up time
and<00:02:00.840> how<00:02:01.290> you<00:02:01.320> select<00:02:01.799> your<00:02:01.920> accessory<00:02:02.460> works

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
and how you select your accessory works

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.539 
and how you select your accessory works
on<00:02:02.850> Windler<00:02:03.240> that's<00:02:04.229> your<00:02:04.799> real<00:02:05.009> ticket<00:02:05.369> there

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
on Windler that's your real ticket there

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.310 
on Windler that's your real ticket there
because<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.299> base<00:02:06.479> system<00:02:06.719> works<00:02:07.110> I<00:02:07.290> mean

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
because the base system works I mean

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.430 
because the base system works I mean
it's<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:07.680> good<00:02:08.599> progressive<00:02:09.599> overload<00:02:09.869> system

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
it's a good progressive overload system

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.720 
it's a good progressive overload system
on<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:10.979> for<00:02:11.220> for<00:02:11.520> big<00:02:11.730> basic<00:02:12.090> list

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
on the for for big basic list

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.449 
on the for for big basic list
so<00:02:13.090> the<00:02:13.209> base<00:02:13.360> template<00:02:13.780> is<00:02:13.900> fine<00:02:14.200> as<00:02:14.500> long<00:02:14.950> as

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
so the base template is fine as long as

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.790 
so the base template is fine as long as
you're<00:02:15.879> programming<00:02:16.450> the<00:02:16.540> accessories<00:02:17.500> to

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
you're programming the accessories to

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.740 
you're programming the accessories to
get<00:02:18.489> what<00:02:18.640> you<00:02:18.760> need<00:02:18.940> that's<00:02:19.180> really<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:19.599> key

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
get what you need that's really the key

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.210 
get what you need that's really the key
to<00:02:19.900> and<00:02:20.080> even<00:02:20.260> those<00:02:20.349> accessories<00:02:20.890> can

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
to and even those accessories can

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.650 
to and even those accessories can
sometimes<00:02:21.550> be<00:02:21.760> extra<00:02:22.060> squatting<00:02:22.480> bench

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
sometimes be extra squatting bench

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.750 
sometimes be extra squatting bench

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
pressing and dead lifting so keep that

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.160 
pressing and dead lifting so keep that
in<00:02:24.819> mind<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.239> accessory<00:02:25.660> work<00:02:25.840> isn't

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
in mind the accessory work isn't

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.449 
in mind the accessory work isn't
