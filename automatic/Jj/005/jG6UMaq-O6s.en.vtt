00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.019
 another place where it was possible to appreciate 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:14.340
 partial way this solar eclipse was in 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:16.440
 Spain despite the bad weather 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.420
 bad weather this morning in almost all 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.960
 Spain with many clouds and rain but 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.950
 even so it has been enjoyed during 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:26.010
 about an hour and a half of a 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:29.130
 privilege this eclipse of sun not total 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.170
 but almost almost we go to science not 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.600
 there is sun crisis is a moment in the 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.850
 which the solar disk is hidden because the 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.489
 moon goes past this science 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.620
 now the beauty itself they remember 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.489
 you what they felt when they saw 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.170
 your first eclipse if you do not try 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.420
 remember with this experiment that we have 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.149
 wanted to make the sensations of the first 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.070
 eclipse in your life a seen eclipse 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:01:03.020
 from the eyes of a child the first time 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:06.270
 with glasses but it has been very cool because 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:08.070
 I have never seen an eclipse and Asia a 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.720
 very good experience clear that when 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.610
 you see they will be kids they could not even 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.220
 get to imagine taking pictures in the sun 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.940
 like who breathes and for the kids 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.940
 it is something elementary 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:28.170
 put the glasses here to the camera and 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.420
 It is obvious that they have been fascinated with 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.700
 something so present that we do not even notice 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.270
 it is like the sun and the moon of pure 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.270
 everyday 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.210
 it looks like the moon 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.010
 the mystery and the utility that can 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.390
 enclose a few simple cardboard glasses 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:50.100
 to see why you can not see 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.850
 directly because if you can not 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.850
 remain forever 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:07.200
 he turned off the bites of course the 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:16.890
 different colors for each eye of a 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:18.690
 child although the magic of an eclipse what 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.319
 There is no doubt that it also involves 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.420
 old 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:26.269
 it's spectacular or it's not scientific 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.730
 escape from work and school 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:32.000
 Nothing is worth it and of course 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.189
 many lovers who come here in the 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.480
 belief that if they kiss with this 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:41.299
 intensity under the flow of an eclipse 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:43.879
 we will be forever after all 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:47.359
 this eclipse has coincided with the beginning 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:49.700
 today of spring and spring is the 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:52.030
 love station reported with petro 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.030
 Apple tree 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:59.730
 we invite you to continue questioning the 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.730
 information with the following videos
