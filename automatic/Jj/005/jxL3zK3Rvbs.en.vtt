00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
cooked so all I'm going to do is

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.100 
cooked so all I'm going to do is
literally<00:01:14.189> lift<00:01:14.460> it<00:01:14.700> out<00:01:14.820> of<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.240> milk<00:01:15.479> and

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
literally lift it out of the milk and

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.530 
literally lift it out of the milk and
pop<00:01:16.409> it<00:01:16.560> straight<00:01:16.590> into<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.219> dish<00:01:17.549> as<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.390> can

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
pop it straight into the dish as you can

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.749 
pop it straight into the dish as you can
see<00:01:18.719> the<00:01:18.869> butter<00:01:19.049> is<00:01:19.259> nearly<00:01:19.590> melted<00:01:19.740> so<00:01:20.640> we'll

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
see the butter is nearly melted so we'll

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.389 
see the butter is nearly melted so we'll
be<00:01:20.880> adding<00:01:21.060> in<00:01:21.360> some<00:01:21.600> plain<00:01:22.110> flour<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:23.219> then

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:23.399 
be adding in some plain flour and then

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:25.550 
be adding in some plain flour and then
once<00:01:23.640> that<00:01:23.789> begins<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.450> bubble<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:25.079> gradually

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
once that begins to bubble you gradually

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.209 
once that begins to bubble you gradually
add<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:27.270> liquid<00:01:28.140> from<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.500> fish<00:01:28.740> that<00:01:29.100> we've

00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:29.219 
add the liquid from the fish that we've

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:31.039 
add the liquid from the fish that we've
drained<00:01:29.729> off<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.240> this<00:01:30.329> is<00:01:30.390> going<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.719> be<00:01:30.899> the

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
drained off and this is going to be the

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.959 
drained off and this is going to be the
base<00:01:31.200> for<00:01:31.229> our<00:01:31.770> sauce<00:01:31.799> for<00:01:32.399> the<00:01:32.579> fish<00:01:32.610> kind

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:32.969 
base for our sauce for the fish kind

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:34.459 
base for our sauce for the fish kind
butters<00:01:33.869> all<00:01:33.990> melted

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:34.469 
butters all melted

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:43.289 
butters all melted
so<00:01:34.890> in<00:01:35.070> Widget<00:01:35.460> flour

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:47.380 

so<00:01:44.299> you<00:01:44.360> just<00:01:44.570> need<00:01:44.840> enough<00:01:45.110> flour<00:01:45.939> to<00:01:46.939> make<00:01:46.969> it

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
so you just need enough flour to make it

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.419 
so you just need enough flour to make it
fairly<00:01:47.840> thick<00:01:49.600> steep<00:01:50.600> stirring<00:01:51.110> it<00:01:51.229> boys<00:01:51.530> get

00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:52.429 
fairly thick steep stirring it boys get

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:55.749 
fairly thick steep stirring it boys get
lumps<00:01:53.470> but<00:01:54.470> the<00:01:54.560> idea<00:01:54.860> is<00:01:55.009> to<00:01:55.159> cook<00:01:55.340> the<00:01:55.490> starch

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
lumps but the idea is to cook the starch

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:57.880 
lumps but the idea is to cook the starch
out<00:01:56.179> of<00:01:56.240> the<00:01:56.539> flour<00:01:56.750> so<00:01:57.200> the<00:01:57.229> actual<00:01:57.590> starch

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
out of the flour so the actual starch

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.399 
out of the flour so the actual starch
grains<00:01:58.189> burst<00:01:58.729> and<00:01:59.509> that's<00:01:59.659> what<00:01:59.869> makes<00:02:00.110> the

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
grains burst and that's what makes the

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:03.219 
grains burst and that's what makes the
sauce<00:02:00.649> thicken<00:02:01.130> you<00:02:02.090> can<00:02:02.240> remove<00:02:02.509> it<00:02:02.719> from<00:02:03.079> the

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
sauce thicken you can remove it from the

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.520 
sauce thicken you can remove it from the
heat
