00:01:21.349 --> 00:01:21.359 
she made like I said she made her own

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:24.709 
she made like I said she made her own
labels<00:01:21.929> here<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.700> the<00:01:23.700> shape<00:01:23.880> matches<00:01:24.450> on<00:01:24.659> the

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:24.719 
labels here and the shape matches on the

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:28.580 
labels here and the shape matches on the
candle<00:01:25.619> box<00:01:25.939> there<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:27.299> she<00:01:28.170> hasn't<00:01:28.320> seen

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
candle box there and she hasn't seen

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.709 
candle box there and she hasn't seen
these<00:01:28.799> I<00:01:28.829> just<00:01:29.159> put<00:01:29.369> these<00:01:29.549> tags<00:01:29.850> on<00:01:30.090> so<00:01:30.390> if<00:01:30.539> she

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:30.719 
these I just put these tags on so if she

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:33.169 
these I just put these tags on so if she
doesn't<00:01:30.960> like<00:01:31.079> them<00:01:31.350> she<00:01:31.979> could<00:01:32.159> just<00:01:32.429> take

00:01:33.169 --> 00:01:33.179 
doesn't like them she could just take

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:34.880 
doesn't like them she could just take
the<00:01:33.329> tag<00:01:33.509> off<00:01:33.719> and<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.200> can<00:01:34.350> be<00:01:34.469> clear<00:01:34.770> like

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
the tag off and it can be clear like

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.580 
the tag off and it can be clear like
that<00:01:35.130> so<00:01:36.060> she<00:01:36.479> can<00:01:36.600> decide<00:01:36.869> what<00:01:37.109> she<00:01:37.229> wants<00:01:37.259> to

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
that so she can decide what she wants to

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.010 
that so she can decide what she wants to
do<00:01:37.710> with<00:01:37.829> them<00:01:38.039> so<00:01:38.759> this<00:01:38.999> is<00:01:39.149> her<00:01:39.359> project<00:01:39.929> and

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.580 
frustrating that is so I came up with
this<00:01:51.840> idea<00:01:52.079> to<00:01:52.350> make<00:01:52.679> these<00:01:52.859> candle<00:01:53.399> boxes<00:01:53.880> and

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
this idea to make these candle boxes and

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.879 
this idea to make these candle boxes and
I<00:01:55.789> got<00:01:56.789> the<00:01:56.969> idea<00:01:56.999> well<00:01:57.929> the<00:01:58.109> first<00:01:58.289> time<00:01:58.499> I<00:01:58.530> saw

00:01:58.879 --> 00:01:58.889 
I got the idea well the first time I saw

00:01:58.889 --> 00:02:01.459 
I got the idea well the first time I saw
it<00:01:58.920> actually<00:01:59.189> was<00:02:00.030> in<00:02:00.209> this<00:02:00.359> Magnolia<00:02:01.200> ink

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
it actually was in this Magnolia ink

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:07.279 
it actually was in this Magnolia ink
magazine<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:04.249> here<00:02:05.249> is<00:02:05.749> one<00:02:06.749> of<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.929> pictures

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:07.289 
magazine and here is one of the pictures

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:10.580 
magazine and here is one of the pictures
of<00:02:07.499> it<00:02:08.509> and<00:02:09.509> they<00:02:09.600> put<00:02:09.780> candy<00:02:10.259> in<00:02:10.289> it<00:02:10.410> and<00:02:10.560> I

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
of it and they put candy in it and I

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.080 
of it and they put candy in it and I
think<00:02:10.770> I'm<00:02:10.860> gonna<00:02:10.950> make<00:02:11.160> a<00:02:11.220> couple<00:02:11.400> with<00:02:11.640> candy

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
think I'm gonna make a couple with candy

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.069 
think I'm gonna make a couple with candy
and

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:15.079 

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:18.349 

here<00:02:16.079> is<00:02:16.379> another<00:02:16.620> one<00:02:16.829> and<00:02:17.579> I<00:02:18.000> was<00:02:18.090> trying<00:02:18.329> to

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:18.359 
here is another one and I was trying to

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:19.910 
here is another one and I was trying to
figure<00:02:18.569> out<00:02:18.599> how<00:02:18.810> I<00:02:18.840> could<00:02:19.200> make<00:02:19.349> these<00:02:19.620> and<00:02:19.859> I

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
figure out how I could make these and I

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.470 
figure out how I could make these and I
thought<00:02:20.099> maybe<00:02:20.370> getting<00:02:20.819> like<00:02:21.060> a<00:02:21.090> deck<00:02:21.450> of

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
thought maybe getting like a deck of

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.800 
thought maybe getting like a deck of
cards<00:02:21.629> and<00:02:22.609> using<00:02:23.609> the<00:02:23.700> inside<00:02:24.329> of<00:02:24.569> a<00:02:24.629> deck<00:02:24.780> of

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
cards and using the inside of a deck of

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.830 
cards and using the inside of a deck of
cards<00:02:25.349> to<00:02:25.439> put<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.769> candles<00:02:26.189> in<00:02:26.659> so<00:02:27.659> here's

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.379 
and some flowers and a little charm and
then<00:03:54.030> in<00:03:54.180> here<00:03:54.540> I<00:03:54.690> put<00:03:54.959> the<00:03:55.709> candles<00:03:56.250> and<00:03:56.489> I

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:57.389

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:00.140 
then in here I put the candles and I
tied<00:03:57.959> it<00:03:57.989> up<00:03:58.379> and<00:03:58.650> I<00:03:59.159> just<00:03:59.400> left<00:03:59.579> this<00:03:59.790> part
