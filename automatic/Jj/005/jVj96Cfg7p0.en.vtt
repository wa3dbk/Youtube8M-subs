00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:31.230 
this is supposed to be green wood
something<00:04:27.220> holding<00:04:27.520> it<00:04:27.670> up<00:04:28.080> and<00:04:29.520> you<00:04:30.520> have<00:04:30.670> log

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
something holding it up and you have log

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:36.000 
something holding it up and you have log
share<00:04:31.570> and<00:04:31.980> they<00:04:32.980> have<00:04:33.160> a<00:04:33.190> stopper<00:04:33.790> and<00:04:35.010> as

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
share and they have a stopper and as

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:40.260 
share and they have a stopper and as
soon<00:04:36.190> as<00:04:36.370> the<00:04:36.460> fire<00:04:36.670> burns<00:04:37.920> when<00:04:38.920> I<00:04:39.280> guess<00:04:40.060> this

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
soon as the fire burns when I guess this

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.140 
soon as the fire burns when I guess this
is<00:04:40.390> supposed<00:04:40.630> to<00:04:40.660> be<00:04:40.750> a<00:04:40.840> bit<00:04:41.050> closer<00:04:41.460> but<00:04:42.460> when

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
is supposed to be a bit closer but when

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.580 
is supposed to be a bit closer but when
these<00:04:43.510> guys<00:04:43.750> go<00:04:44.790> they<00:04:45.790> start<00:04:46.120> rolling<00:04:46.750> the

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
these guys go they start rolling the

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.710 
these guys go they start rolling the
logs<00:04:47.830> you<00:04:48.070> put<00:04:48.280> here<00:04:48.520> they<00:04:48.970> start<00:04:49.270> rolling

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
logs you put here they start rolling

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:56.580 
logs you put here they start rolling
down<00:04:49.900> hill<00:04:50.140> and<00:04:50.520> into<00:04:51.520> your<00:04:51.760> fire<00:04:53.730> but<00:04:54.730> I<00:04:55.590> can

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
down hill and into your fire but I can

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.120 
down hill and into your fire but I can
imagine<00:04:56.770> if<00:04:57.040> the<00:04:57.160> woods<00:04:57.340> really<00:04:57.670> dry<00:04:57.940> or<00:04:59.130> if

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.130 
imagine if the woods really dry or if

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:03.780 
imagine if the woods really dry or if
something<00:05:00.550> sparks<00:05:01.270> it<00:05:01.660> might<00:05:01.930> jump<00:05:02.320> and<00:05:02.790> it

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:03.790 
something sparks it might jump and it

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:06.570 
something sparks it might jump and it
item<00:05:04.060> might<00:05:04.180> stop<00:05:04.480> because<00:05:04.900> of<00:05:05.020> the<00:05:05.080> ash<00:05:05.400> so<00:05:06.400> it

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
item might stop because of the ash so it

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.330 
item might stop because of the ash so it
won't<00:05:06.880> be<00:05:07.000> a<00:05:07.030> constant<00:05:07.510> flyer<00:05:07.750> or<00:05:07.990> it<00:05:08.980> could

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
won't be a constant flyer or it could

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:14.910 
won't be a constant flyer or it could
catch<00:05:09.970> on<00:05:10.150> fire<00:05:10.420> going<00:05:11.170> up<00:05:12.930> so<00:05:13.930> I<00:05:14.260> can't

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:14.920 
catch on fire going up so I can't

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.010 
catch on fire going up so I can't
imagine<00:05:14.980> how<00:05:15.340> you<00:05:15.400> can<00:05:15.580> make<00:05:15.700> this<00:05:15.880> work<00:05:16.020> this

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
imagine how you can make this work this

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.380 
imagine how you can make this work this
is<00:05:17.170> a<00:05:17.200> smaller<00:05:17.560> scale<00:05:18.010> we're<00:05:18.880> gonna<00:05:19.060> leave<00:05:19.180> it

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:19.390 
is a smaller scale we're gonna leave it

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:22.620 
is a smaller scale we're gonna leave it
of<00:05:19.480> that<00:05:20.040> but<00:05:21.060> it's<00:05:22.060> a<00:05:22.360> very<00:05:22.540> interesting

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.630 
of that but it's a very interesting

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:25.530 
of that but it's a very interesting
concept<00:05:23.350> I<00:05:23.590> have<00:05:23.860> never<00:05:24.040> seen<00:05:24.310> it<00:05:24.490> i've<00:05:25.240> never

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:25.540 
concept I have never seen it i've never

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.980 
concept I have never seen it i've never
seen<00:05:25.780> anybody<00:05:25.990> do<00:05:26.710> it<00:05:26.860> on<00:05:27.040> youtube<00:05:27.880> or<00:05:28.060> TV<00:05:28.960> or
