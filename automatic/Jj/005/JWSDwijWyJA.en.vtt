00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
a Jedi that does not mean he couldn't be

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.170

tempted<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.320> dark<00:01:49.530> side<00:01:49.829> in<00:01:50.130> fact<00:01:50.939> I<00:01:51.090> think

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
tempted to the dark side in fact I think

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.060 
tempted to the dark side in fact I think

rebels could be building up to something
terrible<00:01:54.060> happening<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.750> Kanan<00:01:55.079> as<00:01:55.229> the

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770
