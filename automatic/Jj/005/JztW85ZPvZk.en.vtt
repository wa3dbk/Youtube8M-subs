00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
was working well for me because kind of

mattified<00:02:02.410> that<00:02:02.710> area<00:02:03.190> and<00:02:03.460> I<00:02:04.060> really<00:02:04.360> did

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
mattified that area and I really did

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.770 
mattified that area and I really did
like<00:02:04.780> this<00:02:05.110> but<00:02:05.650> I<00:02:05.950> decided<00:02:06.520> to<00:02:06.850> give<00:02:07.090> this<00:02:07.540> a

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
like this but I decided to give this a

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.250 
like this but I decided to give this a
try<00:02:08.050> just<00:02:08.170> to<00:02:08.739> see<00:02:08.769> how<00:02:09.190> it<00:02:09.369> worked<00:02:09.670> this<00:02:10.509> is<00:02:10.899> a

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
try just to see how it worked this is a

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.100 
try just to see how it worked this is a
little<00:02:11.770> bit<00:02:11.980> oilier<00:02:12.630> than<00:02:13.630> my

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
little bit oilier than my

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.970 
little bit oilier than my
tart<00:02:15.370> maybe<00:02:15.970> tinted<00:02:16.780> treatment<00:02:17.470> just<00:02:17.770> a

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
tart maybe tinted treatment just a

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.740 
tart maybe tinted treatment just a
little<00:02:18.250> bit<00:02:18.340> oilier<00:02:18.700> so<00:02:18.970> if<00:02:19.030> you<00:02:19.150> have<00:02:19.360> oily

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
little bit oilier so if you have oily

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.950 
little bit oilier so if you have oily
skin<00:02:20.220> you<00:02:21.220> may<00:02:21.670> want<00:02:21.940> to<00:02:22.000> test<00:02:22.210> this<00:02:22.390> out<00:02:22.600> first

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
skin you may want to test this out first

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.870 
skin you may want to test this out first
