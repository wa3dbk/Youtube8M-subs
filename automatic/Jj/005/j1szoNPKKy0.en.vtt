remember that number so I went here the

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.520 
remember that number so I went here the
numbers<00:01:11.189> going<00:01:11.790> across<00:01:12.090> across<00:01:12.780> across<00:01:12.900> I

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
numbers going across across across I

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.039 
numbers going across across across I
came<00:01:13.740> up<00:01:13.920> with<00:01:13.950> 48<00:01:14.610> boom<00:01:14.850> right<00:01:15.240> there<00:01:15.299> so<00:01:15.689> 48

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
came up with 48 boom right there so 48

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.230 
came up with 48 boom right there so 48
width<00:01:16.439> of<00:01:16.680> six<00:01:16.890> anteriors<00:01:17.430> on<00:01:17.610> curve<00:01:17.909> you

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
width of six anteriors on curve you

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.950 
width of six anteriors on curve you
slashed<00:01:18.540> flat<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:23.330> because<00:01:24.330> it's<00:01:24.509> on<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.659> curve

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
slashed flat and because it's on a curve

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.300 
slashed flat and because it's on a curve
that's<00:01:25.200> right<00:01:25.409> not<00:01:25.710> flat<00:01:25.979> across

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
that's right not flat across

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.350 
that's right not flat across

a<00:01:38.179> little<00:01:38.869> bit<00:01:38.960> of<00:01:39.049> flexibility<00:01:39.590> I'm<00:01:39.710> not<00:01:39.829> used

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
a little bit of flexibility I'm not used

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.389 
a little bit of flexibility I'm not used
to<00:01:40.070> that<00:01:41.020> don't<00:01:42.020> know<00:01:42.079> what<00:01:42.200> to<00:01:42.289> do<00:01:42.409> I<00:01:43.039> made<00:01:43.340> a

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
to that don't know what to do I made a

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:47.919 
to that don't know what to do I made a
choice<00:01:43.670> and<00:01:44.570> I<00:01:45.380> went<00:01:45.590> with<00:01:45.710> it<00:01:46.569> when<00:01:47.569> I<00:01:47.659> go<00:01:47.810> with

00:01:47.919 --> 00:01:47.929 
choice and I went with it when I go with

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:49.630 
choice and I went with it when I go with
go<00:01:48.469> through<00:01:48.649> the<00:01:48.740> G<00:01:48.920> I<00:01:49.100> will<00:01:49.340> just<00:01:49.490> do<00:01:49.609> it

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
go through the G I will just do it

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.249 
go through the G I will just do it
that's<00:01:50.390> unique<00:01:50.630> so<00:01:50.840> I<00:01:50.869> will<00:01:50.990> right<00:01:51.140> in<00:01:51.200> the

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
that's unique so I will right in the

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:54.249 
that's unique so I will right in the
middle<00:01:51.969> margin<00:01:52.969> so<00:01:53.179> we're<00:01:53.569> going<00:01:53.659> to<00:01:53.750> want<00:01:53.869> b1

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
middle margin so we're going to want b1

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:58.059 
middle margin so we're going to want b1
and<00:01:54.590> those<00:01:55.520> sets<00:01:56.209> of<00:01:56.329> teeth<00:01:56.509> and<00:01:57.079> another<00:01:57.709> one

and those sets of teeth and another one

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:59.529 
and those sets of teeth and another one
we'll<00:01:58.250> do<00:01:58.369> is<00:01:58.490> we'll<00:01:58.579> talk<00:01:58.759> about<00:01:58.939> seven<00:01:59.360> teeth
