00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:12.030
 168 valves 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:16.560
 the problem is that with 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:22.680
 and causes an error to just skip me 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:25.800
 no 4 cylinder goes gray smoke column 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.660
 moreover, after peregazovki shot down 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.220
 computer errors all of course 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.600
 tune in after a while 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:36.390
 all back to show when twisting 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:40.020
 candles mean candle was in antifreeze 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.329
 was replaced head gasket but 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.700
 it was head checked completely under 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.440
 press and block the same thing it was 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.309
 done 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:53.850
 4 cylinder was and the door and gold somehow 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.510
 there was a scratch but we thought it was a crack 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.730
 on called just in case 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.020
 then all the same we have repeated 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.250
 nothing helped 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:07.260
 antifreeze goes oil he did not fall as 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.200
 got on a bit of it 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.240
 practically there is no well on the cylinder and 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.580
 accordingly, he fell and the piston 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:19.229
 sucked in this antifreeze 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:23.070
 sat and thought that we could still 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.810
 it turns out here on here 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.600
 I will show you the throttle 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.840
 here they are two pipes that go with 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.150
 coolant with antifreeze 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.939
 I think you can never come here 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.900
 antifreeze we removed the throttle 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:42.560
 looked yes there is the presence of antifreeze 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:46.170
 present we cleaned all the shutter 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:49.560
 gasoline am rubbed it all and did 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.060
 so let's say such a check we can do 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.450
 will help us check the engine 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.880
 may no one show him it's all here it 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.890
 this and the antifreeze nozzles which is here 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:03.420
 connect we mean they are connected 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.040
 kneading them put such a tube on 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.820
 any case though it was possible and not 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.820
 to put 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:14.840
 so it turns out what was the problem took 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:17.959
 throttle and when i blow in 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.680
 this is any of the connections and close 2 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.940
 my finger comes out the air 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.090
 some wrong direction through 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.850
 air through the air connected here 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.819
 through this pipe he goes here and here 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.940
 this air goes card emissions like 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:38.260
 this valve covers do not know how exactly 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:41.269
 call in general such a problem 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:44.600
 antifreeze it bothers me and now 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:46.519
 we will try something we donâ€™t already know 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.680
 what to do and the engine was sent to 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:51.350
 checking everything and nobody can do anything 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.370
 really can be yourself and 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:57.470
 and do everything without any help 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:01.840
 professionals thanks to everyone can someone 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.840
 this video helped meeting
