00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.100
 her pay it as hardly to my first oil's GDP before Schulz I'm doing here 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.359
 So while we become I became 

00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:12.959
 Beijing just let a little bit of insight into the game go quietly 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:17.240
 and a trolley of games I would not have mimicked the storey episodes from the 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.019
 Campaign because I'm already there because I played the 2 Weeze time and 

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:22.970
 is shortly after 8 o'clock 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.789
 I have too 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:28.239
 Zacher was soon to see progress 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:31.669
 she had not played for a year 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:34.669
 and I have to come in here too 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.250
 please under load in the Lenin minute or as soon as I said the same 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.250
 I have not played for a long time 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.350
 the first time with the skills with those in general 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.340
 To count cards have what is Battleforge at all 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.260
 The word seems is a card game you can see here 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
 There are Ficenec cards that you can buy 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.640
 See ticket I hate it a card and 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.060
 then comes a unit 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.060
 the giants one must then fight Kant 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.700
 you can see her there are moments 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.340
 That means if I am currently possible I can decide what 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.180
 for a moment monument I want to build fire there are different m 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.890
 there are starting last year 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.100
 Naturo and frost 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.800
 if I am not wrong 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.410
 and that is quite different which main-post just like the rest see 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.410
 doesn't make 2 Ralf KrÃ¤mer my tour times 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.480
 the subject two seasons 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.480
 Pure nature winter day points a second mon 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.900
 Natural monument because I can build it 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.820
 consequently, second can have built i can only do this thing yet 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.970
 do not build but it is now right up here 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.970
 I played style and players 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.640
 and this is a map and that's called percent 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.200
 as a random SpVg scenario with other players 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.729
 now you can see 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.229
 we want here 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.689
 an example is called the thing 

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:14.889
 Energy crowns 

00:02:14.889 --> 00:02:19.009
 Tesco Stuber's cell phone above can give the animals any ideas we have available 

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:21.029
 to have 

00:02:21.029 --> 00:02:21.769
 and build it
