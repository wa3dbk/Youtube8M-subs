metal bars that I cut with some bolt
cutters<00:00:17.690> with<00:00:18.690> some<00:00:19.670> electrical<00:00:20.670> tape<00:00:20.869> that

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
cutters with some electrical tape that

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.480 
cutters with some electrical tape that
was<00:00:22.020> just<00:00:22.289> for<00:00:22.439> temporary<00:00:22.920> and<00:00:23.130> then<00:00:23.220> I<00:00:23.279> put

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.400 
of these not all of them yet yeah I
stopped<00:00:41.879> about<00:00:42.120> there<00:00:42.450> I<00:00:42.719> just<00:00:43.170> need<00:00:43.290> that

last one and now i'm thinking i might do
some<00:00:47.640> of<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.820> middle<00:00:48.059> ones<00:00:48.270> right<00:00:48.450> here<00:00:48.800> i'm

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
some of the middle ones right here i'm

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.600 
some of the middle ones right here i'm
not<00:00:50.010> quite<00:00:50.219> sure<00:00:50.250> but<00:00:50.780> that's<00:00:51.780> my<00:00:51.960> grass<00:00:52.199> plate

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
not quite sure but that's my grass plate

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.549 
not quite sure but that's my grass plate
and<00:00:53.610> then<00:00:53.730> for<00:00:53.940> my<00:00:54.059> hull<00:00:54.329> i<00:00:54.570> just<00:00:55.020> use<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.320> body

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
and then for my hull i just use the body

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.310 
and then for my hull i just use the body
board<00:00:55.829> or<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.070> boogie<00:00:56.340> board<00:00:56.370> or<00:00:56.699> whatever<00:00:57.320> and

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
board or a boogie board or whatever and

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.720 
board or a boogie board or whatever and
I've<00:00:58.440> got<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:59.809> like<00:01:00.809> handle<00:01:01.350> type<00:01:01.829> things<00:01:02.129> at

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
I've got to like handle type things at

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.350 
I've got to like handle type things at
the<00:01:02.969> same<00:01:03.180> bar<00:01:03.480> that<00:01:03.690> I<00:01:03.719> use<00:01:03.899> for<00:01:03.930> that<00:01:05.360> which

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
the same bar that I use for that which

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.590 
the same bar that I use for that which
I'll<00:01:06.689> use<00:01:07.280> most<00:01:08.280> likely<00:01:08.729> i'll<00:01:08.939> use<00:01:09.210> them<00:01:09.360> for

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
I'll use most likely i'll use them for

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.350 
I'll use most likely i'll use them for
if<00:01:12.600> I<00:01:13.549> what<00:01:14.549> I'm<00:01:14.640> thinking<00:01:14.880> I'm<00:01:14.939> gonna<00:01:15.030> do<00:01:15.180> is

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
if I what I'm thinking I'm gonna do is

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.719 
if I what I'm thinking I'm gonna do is
make<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:16.170> thing<00:01:16.439> on<00:01:16.560> here<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:17.100> where<00:01:17.250> I<00:01:17.610> can

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
make a thing on here to where I can

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.030 
make a thing on here to where I can
raise<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.450> drop<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:20.780> bridge<00:01:21.780> type<00:01:22.170> thing<00:01:22.470> so<00:01:22.680> i

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
raise and drop a bridge type thing so i

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.740 
raise and drop a bridge type thing so i
can<00:01:23.159> drop<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.460> down<00:01:23.549> however<00:01:23.850> RC<00:01:24.240> truck<00:01:24.570> come

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
can drop it down however RC truck come

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.660 
can drop it down however RC truck come
up<00:01:24.869> here<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.290> i'm<00:01:26.070> probably<00:01:26.280> going<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.549> do

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
up here and i'm probably going to do

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.609 
up here and i'm probably going to do
this<00:01:26.909> house<00:01:27.869> that's<00:01:28.140> coming<00:01:28.380> all<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.590> way

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
this house that's coming all the way

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.649 
this house that's coming all the way
around<00:01:28.799> here<00:01:30.320> except<00:01:31.320> for<00:01:31.350> right<00:01:31.590> here

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
around here except for right here

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:34.640 
around here except for right here
probably<00:01:33.659> won't<00:01:33.720> do<00:01:33.930> right<00:01:34.079> here<00:01:34.290> then<00:01:34.530> I'll

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
probably won't do right here then I'll

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.950 
probably won't do right here then I'll
just<00:01:34.680> have<00:01:34.829> this<00:01:35.159> one<00:01:35.400> going<00:01:36.329> all<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.900> way

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
just have this one going all the way

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.859 
just have this one going all the way
across<00:01:37.110> that<00:01:37.619> one<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.549> just<00:01:38.850> like<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.030> thing<00:01:39.360> so

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
across that one and just like a thing so

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.510 
across that one and just like a thing so
I'm<00:01:39.960> just<00:01:40.110> put<00:01:40.320> RC<00:01:40.829> trucks<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.250> stuff<00:01:41.310> on

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
I'm just put RC trucks and stuff on

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.260 
I'm just put RC trucks and stuff on
there<00:01:41.720> then<00:01:42.720> for<00:01:43.079> my<00:01:43.200> dry<00:01:43.409> box<00:01:43.700> type<00:01:44.700> deal<00:01:44.970> I've

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
there then for my dry box type deal I've

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.200 
there then for my dry box type deal I've
got<00:01:45.509> a<00:01:48.079> hair<00:01:49.079> cutter<00:01:49.439> thing<00:01:49.860> I've<00:01:50.820> got<00:01:51.090> my

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
got a hair cutter thing I've got my

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.719 
got a hair cutter thing I've got my
wires<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:52.110> some<00:01:53.009> stuff<00:01:53.220> I<00:01:53.369> was<00:01:53.490> using<00:01:53.640> to

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
wires and some stuff I was using to

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.350 
wires and some stuff I was using to
build<00:01:53.909> this<00:01:54.119> so<00:01:54.329> far<00:01:55.579> in<00:01:56.579> it<00:01:56.790> right<00:01:56.939> now<00:01:57.000> but

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
build this so far in it right now but

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.850 
build this so far in it right now but
that's<00:01:57.570> probably<00:01:57.780> where<00:01:57.960> am<00:01:58.049> I<00:01:58.140> put<00:01:58.320> my<00:01:58.439> servos

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
that's probably where am I put my servos

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.070 
that's probably where am I put my servos
and<00:01:58.890> stuff<00:01:59.579> like<00:01:59.729> that

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:12.720

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
and and then that is hot glued to the

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.980 
and and then that is hot glued to the
fourth<00:02:13.890> and<00:02:14.890> then<00:02:14.980> I<00:02:15.250> used<00:02:15.520> for<00:02:15.910> my<00:02:16.090> motor

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
fourth and then I used for my motor

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.770 
fourth and then I used for my motor
motor<00:02:17.800> mount<00:02:18.060> I've<00:02:19.060> got<00:02:19.270> some<00:02:19.510> duct<00:02:19.720> tape

motor mount I've got some duct tape
going<00:02:19.900> all<00:02:20.350> the<00:02:20.470> way<00:02:20.590> around<00:02:21.240> the<00:02:22.240> board<00:02:22.770> on

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
going all the way around the board on

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.890 
going all the way around the board on
the<00:02:23.920> other<00:02:24.070> side<00:02:24.280> then<00:02:24.460> I<00:02:24.550> put<00:02:25.000> and<00:02:25.210> then<00:02:25.420> I<00:02:25.630> put
