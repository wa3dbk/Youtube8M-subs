 consists here of plastic which is what 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.790
 the cover is not going to uncover the good 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.040
 once we have removed the 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.070

 black carbon does not make a black very 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.049
 I clarify the part of here if they can be seen 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.819
 it becomes transparent what we say 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:09.650
 the fingers as you can see it here but 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:11.510
 good is a case that brings the buttons 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.180
 from here and well let's see how it 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.069

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.860
 pretty fast we have our iphone 5 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:21.170
 but hey we slipped it first shot me 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:24.170

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.420
 putting the power button and the buttons 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.579
 of raising and lowering volume 2 and the other the 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.220
 we press a little bit gently and as 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:32.870
 can see exactly what goes on 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.519
 it's been the iphone 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.379
 in the back you get to appreciate 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:37.640
 little will not reach to see by the 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:40.540
 camera but good if you can see 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.950
 locate an apple that was a hole 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.209
 very roomy for the camera so it does not 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.250
 we have no problem with the flash 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:48.440
 how your investment is exactly very 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.610
 nice thing about the camera we have what 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.190
 is the buttons to go up and 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:54.260
 download the volume very quickly access nothing 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.730
 difficult as you can see here is the button 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.340
 Hong Kong is covered with a button 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.560
 in black the cover surroundings 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.030
 pink melon color something like that if I do not 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.540

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.890

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.120

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:13.160
 very thin button very very easy to 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.750
 accessing the side is what's coming 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.789
