like all seasons summer is the result of
an<00:00:13.500> astronomical<00:00:14.070> fact<00:00:14.639> of<00:00:14.820> life

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:16.930 
an astronomical fact of life

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.830 
an astronomical fact of life
the<00:00:17.260> earth<00:00:17.470> is<00:00:17.770> tilted<00:00:18.010> on<00:00:18.310> its<00:00:18.340> axis<00:00:18.689> 23<00:00:19.689> and<00:00:19.810> a

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:19.840 
the earth is tilted on its axis 23 and a

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.730 
the earth is tilted on its axis 23 and a
half<00:00:19.990> degrees<00:00:21.480> as<00:00:22.480> the<00:00:22.660> planet<00:00:23.050> moves<00:00:23.320> in<00:00:23.619> its

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:23.740 
half degrees as the planet moves in its

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.950 
half degrees as the planet moves in its
yearly<00:00:24.009> orbit<00:00:24.340> that<00:00:24.910> angle<00:00:25.419> comes<00:00:25.660> as<00:00:25.840> the

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:25.960 
yearly orbit that angle comes as the

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.510 
yearly orbit that angle comes as the
position<00:00:26.410> of<00:00:26.500> the<00:00:26.590> northern<00:00:26.890> hemisphere<00:00:27.070> to

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:27.520 
position of the northern hemisphere to

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.420 
position of the northern hemisphere to
change<00:00:27.820> relative<00:00:28.419> to<00:00:28.539> the<00:00:28.630> Sun<00:00:28.869> in<00:00:29.500> the<00:00:30.400> winter

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:30.430 
change relative to the Sun in the winter

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:35.430 
change relative to the Sun in the winter
it's<00:00:31.060> tilted<00:00:31.570> away<00:00:31.660> from<00:00:31.779> the<00:00:32.020> Sun<00:00:34.379> in<00:00:35.379> the

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
it's tilted away from the Sun in the

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.640 
it's tilted away from the Sun in the
summer<00:00:35.860> it<00:00:36.309> angles<00:00:36.760> towards<00:00:37.120> the<00:00:37.269> center

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:37.650 
summer it angles towards the center

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.650 
summer it angles towards the center
because<00:00:38.650> of<00:00:38.830> the<00:00:39.040> planets<00:00:39.430> tilt<00:00:39.760> during<00:00:40.540> the

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:40.660 
because of the planets tilt during the

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.600 
because of the planets tilt during the
summer<00:00:40.900> sunlight<00:00:41.500> hits<00:00:41.739> the<00:00:41.860> earth<00:00:42.100> at<00:00:42.339> a<00:00:42.370> more

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:42.610 
summer sunlight hits the earth at a more

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.720 
summer sunlight hits the earth at a more
direct<00:00:43.000> angle<00:00:43.739> so<00:00:44.739> the<00:00:44.860> warming<00:00:45.280> effect<00:00:45.610> of

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:45.730 
direct angle so the warming effect of

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.070 
direct angle so the warming effect of
the<00:00:45.820> sunlight<00:00:46.210> is<00:00:46.360> more<00:00:46.570> intense<00:00:48.449> plus<00:00:49.449> the

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:50.080 
the sunlight is more intense plus the

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.930 
the sunlight is more intense plus the
Sun<00:00:50.350> is<00:00:50.559> at<00:00:50.680> its<00:00:50.710> highest<00:00:51.070> point<00:00:51.339> in<00:00:51.640> the<00:00:51.699> sky

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
Sun is at its highest point in the sky

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.060 
Sun is at its highest point in the sky
so<00:00:52.600> there<00:00:52.750> are<00:00:52.839> more<00:00:53.019> hours<00:00:53.379> of<00:00:53.409> sunlight<00:00:53.739> to

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
so there are more hours of sunlight to

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.630 
so there are more hours of sunlight to
provide<00:00:54.430> Heat<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:56.500> opposite<00:00:57.070> is<00:00:57.190> true<00:00:57.220> for

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 
provide Heat the opposite is true for

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.070 
provide Heat the opposite is true for
the<00:00:57.729> southern<00:00:58.059> hemisphere<00:00:58.210> where<00:00:58.960> the

00:00:59.070 --> 00:00:59.080 
the southern hemisphere where the

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.530 
the southern hemisphere where the
seasons<00:00:59.290> are<00:00:59.650> reversed<00:00:59.879> when<00:01:00.879> we're<00:01:01.119> angled

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:01.540 
seasons are reversed when we're angled

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.490 
seasons are reversed when we're angled
toward<00:01:01.809> the<00:01:01.960> Sun<00:01:02.199> they're<00:01:02.739> angled<00:01:03.159> away<00:01:04.500> so

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
toward the Sun they're angled away so

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.320 
toward the Sun they're angled away so
