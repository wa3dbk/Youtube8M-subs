 I have here next to the command center 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.500
 that I call with the laptop and the 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.950
 monitor let's get a little 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.399
 detail the laptops as you see there yes 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:53.760

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:56.160
 processed and 7 256 GB hard drive ssd 8 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.100
 gigas of ram good in short is the top of 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.010
 This range is from that range of laptops 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.559
 of the macbook air 13 inches and good 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.070
 here you are watching the connector 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.470
 current and the usb of the capturing 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.810
 what are you going to see now in a second what 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.320
 I am always connected then by the 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:21.000
 another side the adapter to the monitor 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:24.210
 usb bluetooth for the mouse and this is my 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.720
 micro the samsung meteor me that I already taught 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:31.229
 in a good boxing is a tiny mic 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:35.100
 You see that the table takes up very little and 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.920
 nothing is quite good 60 between 60 and 70 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.470
 euros in amazon 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:45.320
 and then my samsung monitor 22 inches 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:47.210
 here the apple bluetooth keyboard and the 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:51.350
 mouse 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:53.210
 logitech and around here we have what 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.550
 that would be the cat catcher there 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.340
 hidden as you see is dwarf the truth 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.649
 it does not take up anything 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.710
 if we follow the cable it takes us here 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:05.700
 to this area where I have another 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.899
 old laptop with windows and such 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.260
 just connect me to this TV for 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:15.250
 watch movies stories and here below and 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:19.239
 we have the console the xbox of 250 gigs 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:21.519
 the elite by his side a hard drive and the 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:24.519
 This battery charger I do not usually use 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:26.769
 the command because I like this other 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:29.920
 since well, I always have a 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:31.840
 charged battery and just what 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.569
 I do that's when I finish the other quito 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.870
 is I put it to load the one that is 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:40.220
 downloaded and ready 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:43.260
 and that as I say is a network hard drive 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:46.680
 some that are called from unter to where 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:49.780
 I usually hang up and leave all the 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.720
 videos that I already have made 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:56.770
 so nothing this would be this other area 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:03:00.280
 then out there I have the router bunch of 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:05.190
 typical cables mess you know 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:06.930
 and this is my little entertainment area game 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.109
 edition 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.849
 watch series movies and everything unique 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:14.340
 who wants to teach a little more in 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:16.950
 detail if it is that you see the 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.460
 programs that you used to 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.740
 and record and edit 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.160
 just like that a little bit above this 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:26.030
 is the 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.950
 the captor's own one that brings 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.819
 the data software 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:35.220
 and well here we have nothing 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:36.840
 just to capture the little eyelash 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.140
 is 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.629
 and then here in edit they go 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:45.150
 leaving all the videos that we have 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:46.980
 What I do here is what I usually do 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.099
 well with this tool that has 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:54.060
 here I'm cutting and adjusting and 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:57.060
 then exported them to errors because it's the 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:00.120
 format that I use for the program 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.250
 edition that is the final cut is exclusive 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.920
 of 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.480
 of mack and good I'll show you a 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.760
 little above so you see it for 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.830
 simple curiosity and I tell you if you have 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.170
 some doubt of this kind of thing good 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:15.170
 you ask me in the comments or a 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:17.390
 private message and I without any problem 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:20.480
 I answer it and well this would be a 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:23.420
 little the interface of the program is very 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.130
 simple and nothing here we would have the 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.260
 projects you are going to see one for example 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.249
 this is the one of the video that I made of 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.859
 France 

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:34.199
 nothing is simply because that is the 

00:04:31.859 --> 00:04:37.259
 edit line you are mounting the clips 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:39.089
 the audio is down here and little else 

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:43.109
 just show you a little bit above 

00:04:39.089 --> 00:04:44.819
 the editing programs that I use and 

00:04:43.109 --> 00:04:47.669
 nothing more guys again thank you 

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:51.689
 all of course the support I love 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:56.489
 that you like what I do and nothing 

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:58.679
 you know I'm a little bit of a break 

00:04:56.489 --> 00:05:01.949
 these days because good my situation 

00:04:58.679 --> 00:05:03.719
 work has changed for the better but in 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:06.329
 As regards YouTube, now 

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:09.389
 I have less time but as I said 

00:05:06.329 --> 00:05:11.279
 on twitter I will continue giving cane for these 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:13.139
 worlds so do not worry maybe 

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:16.229
 there are fewer videos 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:19.349
 logically but good still I will continue 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:22.709
 uploading everything you can and what you 

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:23.939
