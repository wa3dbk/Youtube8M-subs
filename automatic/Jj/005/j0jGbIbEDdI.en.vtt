00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
much more to a workout than just feeling

much more to a workout than just feeling
stimulated<00:00:37.080> I<00:00:37.110> mean<00:00:37.230> you<00:00:37.320> got<00:00:37.470> any<00:00:37.710> other

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:37.740 
stimulated I mean you got any other

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.350 
stimulated I mean you got any other
things<00:00:38.070> maybe<00:00:38.280> hydrated<00:00:38.910> you<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.060> be<00:00:39.180> focused

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
so in terms going to be more strength

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.320 
so in terms going to be more strength
more<00:00:43.260> endurance<00:00:43.680> peak<00:00:43.950> ATP<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.760> this<00:00:45.090> is<00:00:45.180> what

and we're proving it by releasing this
food<00:01:28.770> now<00:01:29.640> is<00:01:29.670> there<00:01:29.850> any<00:01:29.940> creates<00:01:30.240> in<00:01:30.330> this

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.510 
food now is there any creates in this

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.190 
food now is there any creates in this
one<00:01:30.659> yes<00:01:31.380> okay<00:01:31.860> okay<00:01:32.400> so<00:01:33.390> more<00:01:33.840> that's<00:01:34.110> what

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
one yes okay okay so more that's what

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.570 
one yes okay okay so more that's what
we're<00:01:34.350> looking<00:01:34.560> at<00:01:34.650> is<00:01:34.830> and<00:01:35.070> also<00:01:35.250> just

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
we're looking at is and also just

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.430 
we're looking at is and also just
without<00:01:35.940> stimulant<00:01:36.450> look<00:01:36.540> out<00:01:36.690> soon<00:01:36.990> so<00:01:37.320> it's

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
without stimulant look out soon so it's

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.170 
without stimulant look out soon so it's
like<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:37.710> said<00:01:37.890> for<00:01:38.070> somebody<00:01:38.369> who<00:01:38.549> works<00:01:38.940> a

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
like you said for somebody who works a

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.820 
like you said for somebody who works a
late<00:01:39.390> shift<00:01:39.630> or<00:01:40.020> works<00:01:40.409> out<00:01:40.560> at<00:01:40.650> night

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
late shift or works out at night

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.859 
late shift or works out at night
sometimes<00:01:41.580> the<00:01:41.909> stimulants<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:42.600> know<00:01:42.690> kind

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
sometimes the stimulants you know kind

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:43.940 
sometimes the stimulants you know kind
of<00:01:42.900> gets<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.140> them<00:01:43.260> and<00:01:43.380> another<00:01:43.560> way<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:43.740> do

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
of gets to them and another way to do

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.859 
of gets to them and another way to do
that<00:01:44.100> too<00:01:44.220> is<00:01:44.280> if<00:01:44.430> you<00:01:44.580> like<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.299> stimulants

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
that too is if you like the stimulants

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.450 
that too is if you like the stimulants
just<00:01:45.990> take<00:01:46.140> it<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.290> couple<00:01:46.500> hours<00:01:46.830> before<00:01:47.010> it's

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
just take it a couple hours before it's

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.500 
just take it a couple hours before it's
not<00:01:47.549> like<00:01:47.729> you're<00:01:47.909> gonna<00:01:47.970> crash<00:01:48.270> something

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:48.510 
not like you're gonna crash something

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.539 
not like you're gonna crash something
that's<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.869> other<00:01:48.930> option<00:01:49.080> too<00:01:49.650> or<00:01:50.159> just<00:01:50.189> some

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
that's the other option too or just some

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:51.890 
that's the other option too or just some
people<00:01:50.850> are<00:01:50.939> sensitive<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.390> stimulants

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:51.900 
people are sensitive to stimulants

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.200 
people are sensitive to stimulants
though<00:01:52.049> is<00:01:52.500> there<00:01:52.680> anything<00:01:52.860> in<00:01:53.130> here<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.820> help

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
though is there anything in here to help

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.230 
though is there anything in here to help
with<00:01:54.799> performance<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:56.189> has<00:01:56.369> been<00:01:56.520> outside<00:01:57.180> of

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
with performance and has been outside of

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.450 
with performance and has been outside of
nitric<00:01:57.659> oxide<00:01:58.020> production<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:59.040> she<00:01:59.220> beta

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
nitric oxide production and she beta

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.640 
nitric oxide production and she beta
alanine<00:01:59.880> in<00:02:00.060> here<00:02:00.299> that's<00:02:00.900> been<00:02:01.140> at<00:02:01.290> all<00:02:01.409> known

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.650 
alanine in here that's been at all known

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.740 
alanine in here that's been at all known
I<00:02:01.830> think<00:02:01.860> it's<00:02:02.610> real<00:02:02.850> real<00:02:03.000> popular<00:02:03.509> but<00:02:03.659> they

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
I think it's real real popular but they

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.690 
I think it's real real popular but they
we<00:02:03.840> also<00:02:03.960> have<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.290> AV<00:02:04.500> PT<00:02:04.830> which<00:02:05.070> is<00:02:05.220> the<00:02:05.430> form

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
we also have the AV PT which is the form

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.969 
we also have the AV PT which is the form
of<00:02:05.790> creatine<00:02:05.970> analogs<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:06.720> again<00:02:07.500> we<00:02:07.770> put

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
of creatine analogs and again we put

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.259 
of creatine analogs and again we put
just<00:02:08.129> enough<00:02:08.310> creatine<00:02:08.819> in<00:02:08.909> there<00:02:09.030> but<00:02:09.179> we

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:09.269 
just enough creatine in there but we

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:11.149 
just enough creatine in there but we
back<00:02:09.450> it<00:02:09.629> up<00:02:09.689> by<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:09.899> seal<00:02:10.110> in<00:02:10.319> to<00:02:10.500> make<00:02:11.009> sure

00:02:11.149 --> 00:02:11.159 
back it up by the seal in to make sure

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:12.030 
back it up by the seal in to make sure
that<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.549> creatine

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
that the creatine

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.080 
that the creatine
it's<00:02:12.129> in<00:02:12.250> there<00:02:12.430> but<00:02:12.459> then<00:02:12.670> it<00:02:12.700> shuttle

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
it's in there but then it shuttle

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.250 
it's in there but then it shuttle
directly<00:02:13.420> to<00:02:13.540> the<00:02:13.599> muscles<00:02:13.989> so<00:02:14.019> it's

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
directly to the muscles so it's

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.920 
directly to the muscles so it's
immediate<00:02:14.620> use<00:02:14.829> of<00:02:14.950> ATP<00:02:15.480> this<00:02:16.480> is<00:02:16.629> what<00:02:16.780> we're

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
immediate use of ATP this is what we're

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.449 
immediate use of ATP this is what we're
doing<00:02:17.140> middle<00:02:17.409> school<00:02:17.620> chorus<00:02:18.099> also<00:02:18.340> we're

pure<00:02:25.299> performance<00:02:25.599> and<00:02:26.109> you<00:02:26.650> know<00:02:26.739> without

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
pure performance and you know without

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.949 
pure performance and you know without
the<00:02:27.340> interference<00:02:28.030> of<00:02:28.299> stimulants

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
the interference of stimulants

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.289 
the interference of stimulants
okay<00:02:29.260> well<00:02:29.500> that<00:02:30.310> I<00:02:30.519> think<00:02:30.549> covers<00:02:31.030> it<00:02:31.180> you
