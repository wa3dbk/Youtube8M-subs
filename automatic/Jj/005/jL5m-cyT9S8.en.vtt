 only two days after receiving the orders 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.140

 Delivery free shipping is understood 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.750
 we still need to unpack it and insert it 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:55.840
 start 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.220

 Obertor you will be amazed 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.910
 Roolf 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.770
 s 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.770
 Dr 

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:58.959
 Dakar this was obviously ridiculous robots 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.959
 that was obviously not anymore 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.399
 Now I'll show you next to the robot the first time state 

00:03:05.499 --> 00:03:08.569
 League too flat on the ground face down 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.319
 and push the fabric slightly upwards 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.929
 he visits and places where the batteries are used at this point 

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:20.189
 also make the series when the job has found open the lid 

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:21.949
 a cross screwdriver 

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:24.189
 it is very easy 

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:26.150
 miss by the will of the citizens 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.029
 Set the batteries Ahlen 

00:03:28.029 --> 00:03:29.839
 pay attention to the order 

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:33.429
 you always have to use from right to left otherwise the robot will work 

00:03:33.429 --> 00:03:35.619
 not perfect 

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:39.699
 if you put the batteries in lids and reinsert 

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:43.139
 and then screwed with the screwdriver 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:46.139
 Keating falters over it again so you fail the lid 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:00.900
 Now the robot is ready for work and the most common household tasks 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.099
 programmed 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:04.859
 before I go to show some features now 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:08.870
 It should be remembered that the robot also has human needs 

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:10.289
 learns constantly 

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:13.869
 and in some situations you should basically leave alone 

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:21.659
 there 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.650
 Bremen 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:45.639
 No no 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.419
 you'll be surprised sometimes Tyrolean a surprise what I give them 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:01.419
 say 

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:16.069
 also handles unpleasant things 

00:05:19.339 --> 00:05:22.339
 dollar 

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:27.369
 while you calmly do television shows the robot all work in 

00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:30.369
 the kitchen 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.979
 so seen what that thing is down yes 

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:04.080
 that me too that would refuse to work in a household then order him 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.689
 it's easy to do it within two days at Dr it's easy 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.039
 I always think about it 

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:13.930
 if something goes wrong he will not be angry because he will learn it
