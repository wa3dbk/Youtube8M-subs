what fiber X is made out of is reclaimed
wood<00:01:58.729> fiber<00:01:59.000> and<00:01:59.780> that<00:01:59.930> wood<00:02:00.109> fiber<00:02:00.380> comes<00:02:00.710> as

wood fiber and that wood fiber comes as
a<00:02:01.009> byproduct<00:02:01.909> of<00:02:02.420> the<00:02:02.570> manufacturing<00:02:03.229> that<00:02:03.380> we

one of the other great benefits of the
fibrous<00:02:07.759> material<00:02:08.390> is<00:02:08.570> that<00:02:08.869> it's<00:02:09.050> a<00:02:09.289> highly

fibrous material is that it's a highly

times better insulator than aluminum is
which<00:02:16.610> again<00:02:16.880> improves<00:02:17.330> the<00:02:17.450> energy

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
which again improves the energy
