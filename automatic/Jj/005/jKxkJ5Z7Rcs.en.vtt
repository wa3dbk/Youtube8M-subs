here<00:00:01.410> we<00:00:01.500> go<00:00:01.650> again<00:00:01.740> this<00:00:02.490> is<00:00:02.639> the<00:00:02.669> new<00:00:02.820> bold

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
here we go again this is the new bold

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.960 
here we go again this is the new bold
9900<00:00:03.899> it's<00:00:04.859> the<00:00:04.920> new<00:00:05.040> center<00:00:05.279> bold<00:00:05.490> line<00:00:05.700> there

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
9900 it's the new center bold line there

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.670 
9900 it's the new center bold line there
are<00:00:06.029> two<00:00:06.120> devices<00:00:06.330> actually<00:00:06.660> there's<00:00:06.960> a<00:00:06.990> 9900

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
are two devices actually there's a 9900

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.500 
are two devices actually there's a 9900
and<00:00:07.830> that's<00:00:08.010> compatible<00:00:08.340> with<00:00:08.730> hspa+

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
and that's compatible with hspa+

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.600 
and that's compatible with hspa+
networks<00:00:09.870> and<00:00:10.440> then<00:00:10.530> we<00:00:10.620> also<00:00:10.740> have<00:00:10.860> the<00:00:11.010> 9930

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
networks and then we also have the 9930

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.289 
networks and then we also have the 9930
which<00:00:11.849> is<00:00:12.000> compatible<00:00:12.210> cdma<00:00:12.809> ev-do<00:00:13.200> rev<00:00:13.230> a<00:00:14.299> the

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
which is compatible cdma ev-do rev a the

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.390 
which is compatible cdma ev-do rev a the
CDMA<00:00:15.630> device<00:00:15.900> is<00:00:16.350> also<00:00:16.680> a<00:00:16.710> world<00:00:16.920> phone<00:00:17.100> so<00:00:17.279> it

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
CDMA device is also a world phone so it

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.929 
CDMA device is also a world phone so it
supports<00:00:17.570> hspa+<00:00:18.570> roaming<00:00:18.900> on<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.230> 2100<00:00:19.939> it

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
supports hspa+ roaming on the 2100 it

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.529 
supports hspa+ roaming on the 2100 it
also<00:00:21.150> sports<00:00:22.760> Angela<00:00:23.760> it's<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.359> newest

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
also sports Angela it's the newest

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:25.910 
also sports Angela it's the newest
member<00:00:24.810> of<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:24.960> bold<00:00:25.170> line<00:00:25.380> you<00:00:25.680> probably

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
member of a bold line you probably

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.460 
member of a bold line you probably
recognize<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.910> iconic<00:00:27.300> form<00:00:27.480> factor<00:00:27.900> very

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
recognize the iconic form factor very

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.630 
recognize the iconic form factor very
very<00:00:28.560> similar<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:28.949> what<00:00:29.039> we<00:00:29.189> did<00:00:29.279> with<00:00:29.340> bold

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
very similar to what we did with bold

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.070 
very similar to what we did with bold
9000<00:00:30.240> however<00:00:30.480> we've<00:00:30.660> made<00:00:30.779> some<00:00:30.900> pretty

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
9000 however we've made some pretty

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.540 
9000 however we've made some pretty
significant<00:00:31.650> upgrades<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.340> both<00:00:32.430> the

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
significant upgrades and both the

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.030 
significant upgrades and both the
hardware<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.239> software<00:00:33.890> first<00:00:34.890> the

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
hardware and the software first the

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.790 
hardware and the software first the
design<00:00:35.340> ID<00:00:35.550> so<00:00:36.480> it's<00:00:36.870> very<00:00:37.050> very<00:00:37.170> similar<00:00:37.530> but

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
design ID so it's very very similar but

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.650 
design ID so it's very very similar but
what<00:00:37.950> you<00:00:38.040> will<00:00:38.160> notice<00:00:38.399> one<00:00:39.329> big<00:00:39.510> difference

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
what you will notice one big difference

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:40.970 
what you will notice one big difference
is<00:00:39.930> it's<00:00:40.079> quite<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.350> bit<00:00:40.500> thinner<00:00:40.710> than<00:00:40.860> the

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
is it's quite a bit thinner than the

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.340 
is it's quite a bit thinner than the
original<00:00:41.340> bold<00:00:41.520> 9000<00:00:42.090> at<00:00:42.239> 10.5<00:00:42.840> millimeters

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
original bold 9000 at 10.5 millimeters

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.790 
original bold 9000 at 10.5 millimeters
very<00:00:44.160> very<00:00:44.250> sad<00:00:44.370> is<00:00:44.670> 130<00:00:45.180> 30<00:00:45.690> grams<00:00:45.989> what<00:00:46.710> you

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
very very sad is 130 30 grams what you

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.410 
very very sad is 130 30 grams what you
find<00:00:46.980> when<00:00:47.430> you<00:00:47.489> feel<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.820> device<00:00:48.090> is<00:00:48.300> it

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
find when you feel the device is it

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.720 
find when you feel the device is it
feels<00:00:48.629> very<00:00:48.870> very<00:00:49.050> nice<00:00:49.200> very<00:00:49.500> very<00:00:49.620> light<00:00:50.550> in

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
feels very very nice very very light in

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.110 
feels very very nice very very light in
the<00:00:50.789> hand<00:00:51.770> we've<00:00:52.770> also<00:00:52.920> improved<00:00:53.340> materials

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
the hand we've also improved materials

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.000 
the hand we've also improved materials
as<00:00:54.300> well<00:00:54.329> we've<00:00:55.199> got<00:00:55.230> stainless<00:00:55.800> steel

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
as well we've got stainless steel

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.939 
as well we've got stainless steel
construction<00:00:56.699> with<00:00:57.320> woven<00:00:58.320> glass<00:00:58.530> on<00:00:58.920> the

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
construction with woven glass on the

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.490 
construction with woven glass on the
back<00:00:59.129> we<00:00:59.340> get<00:00:59.690> so<00:01:00.690> it's<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.840> very<00:01:01.079> very<00:01:01.140> nice

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
back we get so it's a very very nice

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.280 
back we get so it's a very very nice
very<00:01:01.800> very<00:01:01.920> iconic<00:01:02.129> ID<00:01:02.690> and<00:01:03.690> even<00:01:04.080> though<00:01:04.170> it

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
very very iconic ID and even though it

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.050 
very very iconic ID and even though it
has<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.559> same<00:01:04.769> surface<00:01:05.220> dimensions<00:01:05.820> as<00:01:05.970> the

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
has the same surface dimensions as the

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.399 
has the same surface dimensions as the
bold<00:01:06.210> 9000<00:01:06.689> we've<00:01:06.810> actually<00:01:06.930> been<00:01:07.140> able<00:01:07.229> to

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
bold 9000 we've actually been able to

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.750 
bold 9000 we've actually been able to
make<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.619> keyboard<00:01:08.040> with<00:01:08.220> six<00:01:08.430> percent

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
make the keyboard with six percent

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.760 
make the keyboard with six percent
bigger<00:01:08.939> but<00:01:09.720> I<00:01:09.810> suppose<00:01:10.080> so<00:01:10.290> what<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:10.470> find<00:01:10.500> is

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
bigger but I suppose so what you find is

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.109 
bigger but I suppose so what you find is
you<00:01:10.830> get<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:10.950> fantastic<00:01:11.220> typing<00:01:12.030> experience

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
you get a fantastic typing experience

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.969 
you get a fantastic typing experience
the<00:01:12.630> keyboard<00:01:12.960> feels<00:01:13.110> very<00:01:13.409> very<00:01:13.619> very<00:01:13.770> made

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
the keyboard feels very very very made

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.929 
the keyboard feels very very very made
with<00:01:15.530> that's<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.650> ID<00:01:16.799> in<00:01:17.430> terms<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.820> hardware

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
with that's the ID in terms of hardware

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.200 
with that's the ID in terms of hardware
itself<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.659> made<00:01:18.750> some<00:01:18.900> pretty<00:01:19.040> impressive

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
itself and made some pretty impressive

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.240 
itself and made some pretty impressive
upgrades<00:01:21.210> in<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.540> internals<00:01:22.409> as<00:01:22.530> well<00:01:22.740> the

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
upgrades in the internals as well the

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.999 
upgrades in the internals as well the
first<00:01:23.460> you'll<00:01:23.610> notice<00:01:23.820> is<00:01:24.200> so<00:01:25.200> this<00:01:25.320> is<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.470> 2.8

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
first you'll notice is so this is a 2.8

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.010 
first you'll notice is so this is a 2.8
inch<00:01:26.189> VGA<00:01:26.700> display<00:01:27.320> with<00:01:28.340> 287<00:01:29.340> CPI<00:01:29.820> wood<00:01:30.390> so

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
inch VGA display with 287 CPI wood so

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.929 
inch VGA display with 287 CPI wood so
it's<00:01:31.170> very<00:01:31.530> high<00:01:31.740> resolution<00:01:31.890> display<00:01:32.310> I<00:01:32.820> no

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
it's very high resolution display I no

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.359 
it's very high resolution display I no
matter<00:01:33.150> given<00:01:33.390> a<00:01:33.509> 2-point<00:01:33.900> inch<00:01:34.049> display<00:01:34.530> size

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
matter given a 2-point inch display size

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.960 
matter given a 2-point inch display size
and<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.670> diagonal<00:01:36.060> looks<00:01:36.240> very<00:01:36.420> very<00:01:36.479> nice

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
and the diagonal looks very very nice

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.520 
and the diagonal looks very very nice
we've<00:01:38.970> also<00:01:39.119> upgraded<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.810> chipset<00:01:40.200> so<00:01:40.409> it's

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
we've also upgraded the chipset so it's

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.550 
we've also upgraded the chipset so it's
a<00:01:40.590> 1.2<00:01:41.100> g<00:01:41.250> trip<00:01:41.729> than<00:01:41.850> that<00:01:42.140> we've<00:01:43.140> also<00:01:43.320> added

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
a 1.2 g trip than that we've also added

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.740 
a 1.2 g trip than that we've also added
a<00:01:43.950> number<00:01:44.369> of<00:01:44.549> different<00:01:44.640> sensors<00:01:45.210> so<00:01:45.450> we<00:01:45.570> have

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
a number of different sensors so we have

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.399 
a number of different sensors so we have
a<00:01:45.990> gyroscope<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.740> accelerometer<00:01:48.409> digital

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
a gyroscope and accelerometer digital

results<00:06:30.959> we've<00:06:31.339> reduced<00:06:32.339> the<00:06:32.579> latency<00:06:32.999> in<00:06:33.059> the

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:33.149 
results we've reduced the latency in the

00:06:33.149 --> 00:06:37.030 
results we've reduced the latency in the
shutter<00:06:33.360> as<00:06:33.569> well<00:06:34.129> pretty<00:06:35.129> quick

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:37.040 
shutter as well pretty quick

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.770 
shutter as well pretty quick

so those capabilities are are there in

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:42.260 
so those capabilities are are there in
terms<00:06:39.900> of<00:06:40.140> accessing<00:06:41.010> those<00:06:41.250> sensors<00:06:41.700> the

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:42.270 
terms of accessing those sensors the
