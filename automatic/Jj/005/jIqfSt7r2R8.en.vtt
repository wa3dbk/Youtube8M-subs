00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
my thoughts on it all of the equipment's

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.120 
my thoughts on it all of the equipment's
I<00:00:12.360> usually<00:00:12.750> attached<00:00:13.019> to<00:00:13.380> this<00:00:13.530> weapon<00:00:13.950> and

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
I usually attached to this weapon and

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.829 
I usually attached to this weapon and
the<00:00:14.160> ranges<00:00:14.759> I<00:00:14.849> feel<00:00:15.089> that<00:00:15.269> are<00:00:15.389> most

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
the ranges I feel that are most

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.510 
the ranges I feel that are most
successful<00:00:16.049> for<00:00:16.590> it<00:00:16.710> and<00:00:16.800> of<00:00:16.859> course<00:00:17.100> compare

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
successful for it and of course compare

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.010 
successful for it and of course compare
it<00:00:17.609> to<00:00:17.730> other<00:00:17.760> weapons<00:00:18.359> to<00:00:18.539> see<00:00:18.720> if<00:00:18.840> it's

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
it to other weapons to see if it's

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.590 
it to other weapons to see if it's
worthy<00:00:19.350> of<00:00:19.500> using<00:00:20.160> at<00:00:20.279> all<00:00:20.430> so<00:00:21.240> let's<00:00:21.449> get

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
worthy of using at all so let's get

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.450 
worthy of using at all so let's get

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
basically where this weapon will be

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.119 
basically where this weapon will be
strong<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.809> weak<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.320> you<00:00:40.559> have<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.860> make<00:00:40.980> the

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
strong and weak and you have to make the

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.950 
strong and weak and you have to make the
adjustments<00:00:41.730> their<00:00:41.969> 4th<00:00:42.950> max<00:00:43.950> damage<00:00:44.190> is<00:00:44.460> 25

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
adjustments their 4th max damage is 25

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.139 
adjustments their 4th max damage is 25
minimum<00:00:45.960> is<00:00:46.079> 15.4<00:00:47.039> so<00:00:47.309> already<00:00:47.610> it's<00:00:47.850> dropping

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
minimum is 15.4 so already it's dropping

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.200 
minimum is 15.4 so already it's dropping
lower<00:00:48.539> than<00:00:48.870> most<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.559> LMGs<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.760> assault

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
lower than most of the LMGs and assault

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.700 
lower than most of the LMGs and assault
rifles<00:00:51.570> out<00:00:51.690> there<00:00:51.870> so<00:00:52.050> already<00:00:52.289> you<00:00:52.559> were<00:00:52.649> at

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
rifles out there so already you were at

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.939 
rifles out there so already you were at
a<00:00:52.739> detriment<00:00:53.480> the<00:00:54.480> drop<00:00:54.899> off<00:00:55.050> start<00:00:55.410> damage<00:00:55.800> is

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
a detriment the drop off start damage is

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.369 
a detriment the drop off start damage is
at<00:00:56.070> 8<00:00:56.280> meters<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.940> ends<00:00:57.360> at<00:00:57.449> 50<00:00:57.840> s<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.079> again

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
at 8 meters and ends at 50 s and again

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.680 
at 8 meters and ends at 50 s and again
because<00:00:59.219> it's<00:00:59.399> dropping<00:00:59.699> off<00:00:59.940> at<00:01:00.149> 50<00:01:00.539> meters

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
because it's dropping off at 50 meters

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.410 
because it's dropping off at 50 meters
instead<00:01:01.109> of<00:01:01.230> say<00:01:01.410> 75<00:01:01.980> you're<00:01:02.579> losing<00:01:03.030> damage

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
instead of say 75 you're losing damage

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.359 
instead of say 75 you're losing damage
over<00:01:03.719> range<00:01:03.960> per<00:01:04.290> bullet<00:01:04.500> so<00:01:04.890> that's<00:01:05.040> again

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
over range per bullet so that's again

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.120 
over range per bullet so that's again
another<00:01:05.430> issue<00:01:06.560> so<00:01:07.560> you're<00:01:07.710> at<00:01:07.830> it<00:01:07.950> alright

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
another issue so you're at it alright

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.530 
another issue so you're at it alright
already<00:01:08.580> it's<00:01:08.820> painted<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.150> picture<00:01:09.270> that

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
already it's painted the picture that

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.179 
already it's painted the picture that
you're<00:01:09.659> at<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.810> disadvantage<00:01:09.990> versus<00:01:10.860> multi

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
you're at a disadvantage versus multi

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.780 
you're at a disadvantage versus multi

rates 880 rounds per minute which is

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.380 
rates 880 rounds per minute which is
quite<00:01:17.009> high<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.549> you'll<00:01:17.759> have<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:17.909> advantage

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
quite high and you'll have the advantage

terms of horizontal recoil there's a

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.870 
terms of horizontal recoil there's a

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
decimal point

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.220

or<00:02:13.910> to<00:02:14.000> the<00:02:14.030> left<00:02:14.120> and<00:02:14.450> point<00:02:14.720> three<00:02:15.020> to<00:02:15.140> the

or to the left and point three to the

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.500 
or to the left and point three to the

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
right so the higher the decimal the more

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.390

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
the recoil to that way so obviously it

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.510 
the recoil to that way so obviously it
has<00:02:19.580> a<00:02:19.610> vertical<00:02:20.410> horizontal<00:02:21.410> recoil<00:02:22.010> to<00:02:22.400> the

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
has a vertical horizontal recoil to the

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.240 
has a vertical horizontal recoil to the
left<00:02:23.260> but<00:02:24.260> it's<00:02:24.410> easy<00:02:24.560> to<00:02:24.740> counter<00:02:25.040> as<00:02:25.100> well

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
left but it's easy to counter as well

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.100 
left but it's easy to counter as well
because<00:02:25.550> it's<00:02:25.670> not<00:02:25.820> a<00:02:26.030> large<00:02:26.390> it's<00:02:26.840> only<00:02:27.020> a

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
because it's not a large it's only a

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.450 
because it's not a large it's only a
point<00:02:27.380> one<00:02:27.500> different<00:02:27.980> so<00:02:28.160> it's<00:02:28.310> not

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
point one different so it's not

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.970 
point one different so it's not
manageable<00:02:28.940> it's<00:02:29.240> not<00:02:29.360> unmanageable<00:02:29.980> so

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
manageable it's not unmanageable so

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.650 
manageable it's not unmanageable so
overall<00:02:31.640> when<00:02:31.820> you<00:02:31.910> break<00:02:32.090> it<00:02:32.240> down<00:02:32.360> its

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
overall when you break it down its

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.350 
overall when you break it down its
vertical<00:02:33.080> recoil<00:02:33.260> is<00:02:33.680> very<00:02:33.920> manageable<00:02:34.370> and

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
vertical recoil is very manageable and

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.120 
vertical recoil is very manageable and
it's<00:02:35.570> horizontal<00:02:35.810> recall<00:02:36.470> you<00:02:36.620> have<00:02:36.800> you<00:02:36.980> do

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
it's horizontal recall you have you do

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:38.440 
it's horizontal recall you have you do
have<00:02:37.250> to<00:02:37.370> compensate<00:02:37.640> for<00:02:37.880> the<00:02:37.970> fact<00:02:38.000> that<00:02:38.270> it

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
have to compensate for the fact that it

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.630 
have to compensate for the fact that it
wants<00:02:38.840> to<00:02:38.930> fire<00:02:39.140> to<00:02:39.350> the<00:02:39.440> left<00:02:39.650> a<00:02:39.800> bit<00:02:39.830> other

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
wants to fire to the left a bit other

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.030 
wants to fire to the left a bit other
than<00:02:40.850> that<00:02:41.030> it's<00:02:41.270> not<00:02:41.480> a<00:02:41.510> huge<00:02:41.780> deal<00:02:42.110> when<00:02:42.950> you

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
than that it's not a huge deal when you

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.130 
than that it's not a huge deal when you
compare<00:02:43.460> this<00:02:43.610> weapon<00:02:44.030> to<00:02:44.240> basically<00:02:44.840> my
