00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.400
 today I would like to make a video in 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:11.160
 continuation of the topic correct and useful 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:14.880
 food all probably always often very 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:19.320
 often heard such an expression as salt 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:21.900
 white poison is not very scary if it 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:29.179
 white poison than we eat with everything 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:32.790
 everywhere we put in each dish and consume 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:36.270
 all the other spices to give healthy pepper 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.070
 wholesome turmeric and everything else is it 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:43.879
 Is n't it really that bad ? 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:49.219
 salt as her answer answer yes and no all 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:53.329
 do salt amount if we eat 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:55.920
 on the day kirieshki in the morning crunches 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:58.739
 any other lunch study 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.770
 in the evening, plus everything is polished red 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.970
 fish salty then naturally we own 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:08.850
 body causes irreparable harm and 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:11.610
 we introduce ourselves systematic diseases but at that 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.909
 same time if we sit on without salt 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.570
 diet it is fraught for us also many 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.729
 diseases 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.130
 one of which is a disease 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.509
 Alzheimer's 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:28.950
 senile dementia 40 years with 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:32.040
 salt-free diet can go mad them 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.170
 no longer wake up to normal 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.229
 state 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:39.750
 so first of all when it comes 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:43.530
 comes about salt talk about the right 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:46.850
 the amount of salt should be included in the diet 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:50.820
 daily diet not more than five grams 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.600
 a day yes that is no more than five grams 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.820
 salt 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.770
 what is 5 grams really is 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:00.920
 quite a lot but you need to take into account 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:04.860
 that salt and vaults come in vegetables and fruits 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:07.229
 so watch carefully for the composition 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.630
 ate candy you know there is a conflict 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.590
 salt despite the fact that the concerts are sweet 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:16.380
 salt is used as in the earring taste 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:19.110
 ate vegetables you know what's there too 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.709
 only this is better 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.510
 the dish is a little not to salty and 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:27.890
 soon do not understand that the dish have 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:31.739
 own unpleasant taste and salt 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.620
 resettlement she doesn't need it only 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:36.330
 receptor irritation 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.030
 but why did I start talking salt and 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.800
 that I suppose I myself ordinary salt is not 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.860
 I do not accept 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:47.250
 and not used by their little 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:50.220
 why men because salt which 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.819
 transferred to the table salt stores 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:57.120
 industrial salt actually which 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:59.850
 convenient to sprinkle the tracks in the winter so they 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:03.380
 were not slippery but take it in 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:07.109
 I do not recommend eating a good substitute 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:10.709
 usually purposes this is himalayan salt 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:12.209
 pink yes and talk about her because 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.100
 it is sold in our store 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:17.010
 online store botany from the Urals. 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:20.450
 It is sold there for a reason namely 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:24.370
 because I myself am a supporter of this salt 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:26.810
 I want to share such useful with 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.790
 healthy spices with you 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:33.379
 by customers 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:38.680
 it looks like the manufacturer's 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:42.260
 by the way indigo this is Yekaterinburg more precisely 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:44.900
 city ​​of Berezovsky, Kirov region 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:50.360
 so the manufacturer can be trusted 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:54.640
 personal in production neatly good 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:58.940
 cozy beautiful suppliers are very good 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:02.060
 This is how it looks like salt 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:06.739
 There is this pink crystals which 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:09.980
 dissolve in water and pink they 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:12.200
 of course do not leave pink 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.930
 due only to the fact that salt is preserved 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:18.290
 all the original minerals that are 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:21.829
 it was and is what the salt is different 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:24.470
 Himalayan pink salt to normal 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:27.680
 huge in fact the amount of difference 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:29.780
 She has it in the first place 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.700
 the back is written unfortunately on video 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.650
 not visible but I think you will gain and 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.210
 read a huge amount 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:40.550
 trace elements which are part 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:45.020
 salts 74 beneficial trace elements 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:48.220
 list them this for 10 minutes of ours 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:53.139
 video and do i'm assigned on because 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:53.139
 I think you can read all this 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:05:00.080
 There is certainly another alternative to the usual 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:03.860
 salt is sea salt is indian 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:06.590
 black salt is also such a salt too 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:09.020
 from the manufacturer and deg with reduced 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:11.479
 sodium content but this is really 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:13.060
 business of pampering for those who simply do not 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:17.289
 can deny yourself the pleasure 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:19.510
 eat the usual salty food 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:21.520
 himalayan pink salt she 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:24.790
 and for some difficult to use 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.410
 that is, let's say some definite 

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:30.130
 dishes must first be dissolved in water 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:33.010
 then this water already loved yes I do not 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:36.340
 do i cook everything in the slow cooker in 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:38.620
 my favorite and actually throw there 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:41.460
 salt she is there to dissolve here plus 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:44.410
 still for example there is a handy thing like 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:46.830
 so same degas same 

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:51.160
 Himalayan pink in the mill here 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:54.610
 zaparivatsya it is not necessary from a milled 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:56.860
 crushed sprinkled and enjoy life but 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:06:00.820
 salt with reduced drop inside 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:04.300
 which I have already said it is in principle 

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:06.040
 better absorbed by the body and not 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:10.240
 the body is removed all the rest 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:12.940
 useful salts are salts of potassium or magnesium and 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:17.320
 other stuff yes what else is there especially 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:20.740
 useful and there is degas salt himalayan 

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:22.870
 pink also has a pleasant 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:27.400
 she does not give taste 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:31.240
 such an annoying salty taste she 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:35.230
 gives you a nicer soft complement to the dish 

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:38.130
 taste which is very harmoniously combined 

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:40.810
 and with vegetables and meat dishes 

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:45.310
 very, very everything that you eat I'm not with 

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:47.170
 but I use meat for my husband 

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:52.030
 from spread salt to him too 

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:57.600
 like here but the main use 

00:06:52.030 --> 00:07:00.730
 this salt you save on one side 

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:03.490
 keep in your diet the necessary 

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:07.360
 trace elements yes salt will 

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:09.520
 maintain and water-salt balance in 

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:12.490
 body also nourish brain cells 

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:15.720
 and at the same time you do not harm your 

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:17.850
 body because you won't 

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:23.140
 use 

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:25.270
 chemically processed foods in their 

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:27.730
 daily nutrition itself daily 

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:30.400
 the diet therefore I strongly advise you 

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:33.520
 still try this salt not 

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:35.860
 be sure to buy in the online store 

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:37.300
