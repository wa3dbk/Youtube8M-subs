will have to rotate through but for our

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
a very nice day once we get these like

a very nice day once we get these like
clouds<00:00:30.119> out<00:00:30.300> of<00:00:30.420> here<00:00:30.510> this<00:00:30.630> morning<00:00:30.960> and

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
clouds out of here this morning and

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
here on the eastern areas but i think

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.220 
here on the eastern areas but i think
that<00:00:35.370> quickly<00:00:35.640> moves<00:00:35.940> out<00:00:36.149> here<00:00:36.180> we'll<00:00:37.140> have

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
that quickly moves out here we'll have

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.720 
that quickly moves out here we'll have
some<00:00:37.350> freezing<00:00:37.620> conditions<00:00:37.890> behind<00:00:38.460> this<00:00:38.550> low

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
some freezing conditions behind this low

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.400 
some freezing conditions behind this low
pressure<00:00:38.969> that's<00:00:39.360> because<00:00:39.629> you<00:00:39.780> have<00:00:39.989> these

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
pressure that's because you have these

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.920 
pressure that's because you have these
isobars<00:00:41.309> are<00:00:41.489> not<00:00:42.270> really<00:00:42.510> too<00:00:42.660> tightly

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
isobars are not really too tightly

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.680 
isobars are not really too tightly
packed<00:00:43.320> together<00:00:43.860> here<00:00:44.340> but<00:00:44.550> enough<00:00:45.420> that

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
packed together here but enough that

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.410 
packed together here but enough that
will<00:00:46.170> be<00:00:46.320> you<00:00:46.469> will<00:00:46.500> have<00:00:46.770> a<00:00:46.890> breeze<00:00:47.420> around

here you see this Ford Falls a party or
six<00:01:06.960> seven<00:01:07.320> o'clock<00:01:07.560> in<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.740> morning<00:01:08.070> so<00:01:08.580> once

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
you get past seven eight o'clock I think

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.990 
you get past seven eight o'clock I think
it's<00:01:10.560> pretty<00:01:10.860> much<00:01:11.040> out<00:01:11.250> of<00:01:11.280> here<00:01:11.490> some<00:01:11.700> some

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
it's pretty much out of here some some

was<00:01:14.220> talking<00:01:14.549> about<00:01:14.670> up<00:01:14.939> but<00:01:15.150> that's<00:01:15.420> convenor

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
was talking about up but that's convenor

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.289 
was talking about up but that's convenor
for<00:01:16.049> northwestern<00:01:16.650> zones<00:01:16.920> so<00:01:17.610> places<00:01:18.030> that<00:01:18.180> by

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
for northwestern zones so places that by

State College Williamsport will still be
under<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.369> influence<00:01:20.549> of<00:01:20.759> some<00:01:20.909> clouds<00:01:21.210> and

perhaps<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.380> spotty<00:01:22.650> shower<00:01:23.030> or<00:01:24.030> you<00:01:24.689> know

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
perhaps a spotty shower or you know

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.710 
perhaps a spotty shower or you know
maybe<00:01:25.020> some<00:01:25.530> drizzle<00:01:25.799> yet<00:01:26.210> until<00:01:27.210> this<00:01:27.360> energy

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
maybe some drizzle yet until this energy

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.330 
maybe some drizzle yet until this energy
pulls<00:01:27.930> away<00:01:28.080> in<00:01:28.320> this<00:01:28.409> will<00:01:28.619> be<00:01:28.680> primarily<00:01:28.890> for

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
pulls away in this will be primarily for

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.530 
pulls away in this will be primarily for
the<00:01:29.369> morning<00:01:29.700> hours<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:29.970> it<00:01:30.180> pulls<00:01:30.390> away

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
the morning hours and it pulls away

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.710 
the morning hours and it pulls away
because<00:01:31.530> of<00:01:31.740> that<00:01:32.390> temperatures<00:01:33.390> down<00:01:33.479> here

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
because of that temperatures down here

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.260 
because of that temperatures down here
going<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:33.869> get<00:01:33.960> into<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.170> 60s<00:01:34.619> I<00:01:34.860> got<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:35.880> circle

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270

especially out here in this area here
you're<00:01:51.119> going<00:01:51.240> to<00:01:51.299> be<00:01:51.390> stuck<00:01:51.450> in<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.899> in<00:01:52.110> the

lower<00:01:52.680> 50<00:01:53.220> is<00:01:53.340> lower<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:53.729> mid<00:01:53.909> 50s<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.390> that's

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
lower 50 is lower to mid 50s and that's

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.880 
lower 50 is lower to mid 50s and that's
because<00:01:54.720> you<00:01:54.840> have<00:01:55.020> those<00:01:55.110> clouds<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.710> that

because you have those clouds and that

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.910 
because you have those clouds and that
shower<00:01:56.189> threat<00:01:56.520> early<00:01:56.790> on<00:01:57.000> so<00:01:57.409> you<00:01:58.409> know<00:01:58.500> areas

further for the reefs again in the
sunshine<00:02:01.049> sooner<00:02:01.409> we'll<00:02:01.590> have<00:02:01.799> a<00:02:02.159> chance<00:02:02.610> to

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
warm up a little bit faster you see that

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.560 
warm up a little bit faster you see that
precipitation<00:02:05.280> does<00:02:05.579> end<00:02:05.850> as<00:02:06.119> we<00:02:06.329> go<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.479> the

Friday pretty much the same deal and the

Friday pretty much the same deal and the
GFS<00:02:44.750> has<00:02:44.930> slowed<00:02:45.230> down<00:02:45.379> the<00:02:45.560> front<00:02:45.739> just<00:02:46.040> a

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:46.129 
GFS has slowed down the front just a

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:49.150 
GFS has slowed down the front just a
little<00:02:46.519> bit<00:02:46.810> but<00:02:47.810> there<00:02:48.079> will<00:02:48.230> be<00:02:48.319> some<00:02:48.500> more

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
little bit but there will be some more

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.569 
little bit but there will be some more
clouds<00:02:49.489> and<00:02:50.500> perhaps<00:02:51.500> a<00:02:51.799> shower<00:02:52.010> here<00:02:52.370> it's

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:52.579 
clouds and perhaps a shower here it's

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:54.069 
clouds and perhaps a shower here it's
just<00:02:52.640> a<00:02:52.879> very<00:02:53.090> light<00:02:53.359> shower<00:02:53.629> you're<00:02:53.870> not<00:02:54.049> a

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:54.079 
just a very light shower you're not a

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:55.839 
just a very light shower you're not a
big<00:02:54.290> deal<00:02:54.470> here<00:02:54.799> we're<00:02:55.160> looking<00:02:55.430> for<00:02:55.670> on

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:55.849 
big deal here we're looking for on

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:58.030 
big deal here we're looking for on
Friday<00:02:56.209> here<00:02:56.599> but<00:02:57.230> this<00:02:57.379> is<00:02:57.560> definitely<00:02:57.829> a

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
Friday here but this is definitely a

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.559 
Friday here but this is definitely a
cold<00:02:58.430> front<00:02:58.670> that's<00:02:58.790> moving<00:02:58.910> through<00:02:59.329> here

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 
cold front that's moving through here

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:00.729 
cold front that's moving through here
it's<00:02:59.629> going<00:02:59.750> to<00:02:59.840> take<00:02:59.959> its<00:03:00.109> time<00:03:00.319> moving

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
it's going to take its time moving

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.979 
it's going to take its time moving
through<00:03:01.069> and<00:03:01.510> because<00:03:02.510> of<00:03:02.540> that<00:03:02.629> you<00:03:02.750> can<00:03:02.840> have

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
through and because of that you can have

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:04.960 
through and because of that you can have
some<00:03:03.200> more<00:03:03.829> clouds<00:03:04.069> and<00:03:04.280> Sun<00:03:04.459> are<00:03:04.489> probably<00:03:04.879> on

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
some more clouds and Sun are probably on

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.910 
some more clouds and Sun are probably on
Friday<00:03:05.329> and<00:03:05.660> that<00:03:06.230> change<00:03:06.440> to<00:03:06.560> the<00:03:06.680> shower

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
Friday and that change to the shower

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.860 
Friday and that change to the shower
because<00:03:07.519> of<00:03:07.790> that<00:03:07.910> temperature<00:03:08.299> me<00:03:08.510> or<00:03:08.690> not

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
because of that temperature me or not

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.059 
because of that temperature me or not
going<00:03:09.019> to<00:03:09.079> be<00:03:09.140> quite<00:03:09.379> as<00:03:09.560> warm<00:03:09.709> as<00:03:09.890> they<00:03:10.010> were

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
going to be quite as warm as they were

to the southwest there's me a cold front
that's<00:03:57.739> going<00:03:57.919> to<00:03:57.980> be<00:03:58.040> moving<00:03:58.190> through<00:03:58.519> here

sunday i think many locations are at

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:12.069 
sunday i think many locations are at
least<00:04:10.250> from<00:04:10.430> our<00:04:10.579> central<00:04:11.090> and<00:04:11.329> southern

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:12.079 
least from our central and southern

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:14.670 
least from our central and southern
areas<00:04:12.560> we're<00:04:12.650> going<00:04:12.769> to<00:04:12.829> get<00:04:13.000> 70<00:04:14.000> or<00:04:14.120> higher<00:04:14.389> on

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680

this going to be

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:28.839 
this going to be

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:30.070 
through but that's not going to be until
here's<00:04:29.210> something<00:04:29.479> that<00:04:29.629> we're<00:04:29.780> looking<00:04:29.870> at

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
here's something that we're looking at

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.320 
here's something that we're looking at
right<00:04:30.199> now<00:04:30.259> study<00:04:30.770> is<00:04:30.889> still<00:04:31.210> draped<00:04:32.210> across

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
right now study is still draped across

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.629 
right now study is still draped across
Northwest<00:04:33.229> PA<00:04:33.409> and<00:04:33.800> western<00:04:34.189> New<00:04:34.340> York<00:04:34.400> at

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:34.639 
Northwest PA and western New York at

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:36.909 
Northwest PA and western New York at
this<00:04:34.789> point<00:04:35.060> so<00:04:35.270> because<00:04:35.599> of<00:04:35.629> that<00:04:35.810> this<00:04:36.770> will

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:36.919 
this point so because of that this will

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:38.800 
this point so because of that this will
be<00:04:36.949> aided<00:04:37.400> with<00:04:37.909> a<00:04:37.939> southwesterly<00:04:38.539> wooden

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
be aided with a southwesterly wooden

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:40.089 
be aided with a southwesterly wooden
flow<00:04:38.930> ahead<00:04:39.169> of<00:04:39.289> a<00:04:39.349> cold<00:04:39.379> front<00:04:39.620> like<00:04:40.009> it

00:04:40.089 --> 00:04:40.099 
flow ahead of a cold front like it

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:41.769 
flow ahead of a cold front like it
normally<00:04:40.219> is<00:04:40.580> so<00:04:41.210> those<00:04:41.389> temperatures<00:04:41.629> are

00:04:41.769 --> 00:04:41.779 
normally is so those temperatures are

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:43.689
