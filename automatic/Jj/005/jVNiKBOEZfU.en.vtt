the tip you want to use the one at the

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.530 
the tip you want to use the one at the
base<00:01:48.210> first<00:01:52.160> you<00:01:53.160> lay<00:01:53.370> the<00:01:53.520> crimp<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.000> crimp

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
base first you lay the crimp to a crimp

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.420 
base first you lay the crimp to a crimp
bead<00:01:54.630> in<00:01:55.400> that<00:01:56.400> slot<00:01:56.760> and<00:01:57.600> mash<00:01:58.260> it<00:01:58.340> till<00:01:59.340> you

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
bead in that slot and mash it till you

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.200 
bead in that slot and mash it till you
get<00:01:59.580> this<00:01:59.760> little<00:02:00.410> Halfmoon<00:02:01.410> shape<00:02:02.210> crescent

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
get this little Halfmoon shape crescent

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.800 
get this little Halfmoon shape crescent
shape<00:02:03.830> then<00:02:04.830> you<00:02:04.979> turn<00:02:05.220> it<00:02:05.400> up<00:02:05.850> sideways<00:02:06.600> like

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
shape then you turn it up sideways like

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:14.810 
shape then you turn it up sideways like
this<00:02:06.870> put<00:02:07.860> it<00:02:07.950> in<00:02:08.130> the<00:02:08.280> front<00:02:08.520> channel<00:02:13.820> now

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
this put it in the front channel now

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.670 
this put it in the front channel now
shake<00:02:15.090> em<00:02:16.640> till<00:02:17.640> it<00:02:17.760> folds<00:02:18.150> it<00:02:18.270> over<00:02:18.390> and<00:02:19.350> then

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
shake em till it folds it over and then

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.440 
shake em till it folds it over and then
what<00:02:19.920> I<00:02:19.950> often<00:02:20.550> do<00:02:20.730> is<00:02:20.940> we'll<00:02:21.090> go<00:02:21.209> back<00:02:21.420> and

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
what I often do is we'll go back and

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.449 
what I often do is we'll go back and
match<00:02:21.900> it<00:02:22.110> again<00:02:22.440> with<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.680> very<00:02:22.860> tip<00:02:23.130> of<00:02:23.310> the

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
match it again with the very tip of the

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.310 
match it again with the very tip of the
crimp<00:02:23.910> tool<00:02:24.090> just<00:02:24.959> to<00:02:25.140> make<00:02:25.410> sure<00:02:25.440> it's<00:02:25.770> flat

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
crimp tool just to make sure it's flat

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.680 
crimp tool just to make sure it's flat
this<00:02:28.320> is<00:02:28.470> how<00:02:28.590> you<00:02:28.650> crimp<00:02:29.010> your<00:02:29.130> bead<00:02:29.690> next

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
this is how you crimp your bead next

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:31.460 
this is how you crimp your bead next
thing<00:02:30.780> you're<00:02:30.900> going<00:02:30.990> to<00:02:31.050> do<00:02:31.170> is<00:02:31.320> start

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
thing you're going to do is start

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.320 
thing you're going to do is start
stringing<00:02:31.800> your<00:02:31.920> beads<00:02:31.980> on

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:36.790 

all<00:02:35.780> you<00:02:35.930> would<00:02:36.020> do<00:02:36.140> is<00:02:36.170> just<00:02:36.440> ring<00:02:36.680> the

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
all you would do is just ring the

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.480 
all you would do is just ring the
pattern<00:02:37.190> that<00:02:37.600> you've<00:02:38.600> got<00:02:38.810> laid<00:02:38.960> out<00:02:39.490> onto

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
pattern that you've got laid out onto

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:46.780 
pattern that you've got laid out onto
the<00:02:40.610> wire<00:02:44.500> the<00:02:45.500> first<00:02:45.770> couple<00:02:46.250> of<00:02:46.340> beads<00:02:46.490> will

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
the wire the first couple of beads will

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.630 
the wire the first couple of beads will
cover<00:02:47.060> your<00:02:47.270> tail<00:02:47.600> of<00:02:48.200> the<00:02:48.800> wire<00:02:48.980> right<00:02:49.340> below

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
cover your tail of the wire right below

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.820 
cover your tail of the wire right below
the<00:02:49.850> crimp<00:02:50.120> bead<00:02:53.380> then<00:02:54.380> you<00:02:54.470> continue

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
the crimp bead then you continue

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.320 
the crimp bead then you continue
stringing<00:02:55.430> until<00:02:55.730> you<00:02:55.790> get<00:02:55.940> to<00:02:56.060> the<00:02:56.180> other

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
stringing until you get to the other

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:01.510 
stringing until you get to the other
hand<00:02:59.560> now<00:03:00.560> that<00:03:00.740> you've<00:03:00.890> got<00:03:01.070> most<00:03:01.280> of<00:03:01.400> the

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
hand now that you've got most of the

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
finish stringing the rest of the beads

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.980 
finish stringing the rest of the beads
on<00:03:04.640> and<00:03:04.910> then<00:03:05.090> we're<00:03:05.240> going<00:03:05.330> to<00:03:05.390> crimp<00:03:05.750> the

other end of the bracelet and you'll

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:24.119 
other end of the bracelet and you'll
have<00:03:09.380> a<00:03:09.410> completed<00:03:09.800> bracelet

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:24.129 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:26.489 

this<00:03:24.609> is<00:03:24.760> my<00:03:24.909> last<00:03:25.120> bead<00:03:25.420> and<00:03:25.629> I'm<00:03:26.079> going<00:03:26.439> to

a tad bit longer so you can remove or

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.070 
a tad bit longer so you can remove or
add<00:03:43.590> beads<00:03:43.950> as<00:03:44.340> needed<00:03:44.760> next<00:03:45.450> thing<00:03:45.750> you'll<00:03:45.900> do

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
add beads as needed next thing you'll do

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:54.280 
add beads as needed next thing you'll do
is<00:03:46.260> you'll<00:03:46.760> string<00:03:47.760> on<00:03:47.880> another<00:03:48.360> crimp<00:03:48.690> bead

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.780 

run<00:03:55.290> it<00:03:55.440> through<00:03:55.620> the<00:03:55.830> other<00:03:56.250> end<00:03:56.580> of<00:03:56.670> the

then do the same here neat little test
is<00:04:34.949> to<00:04:35.099> kind<00:04:35.310> of<00:04:35.370> take<00:04:35.580> the<00:04:35.699> bracelet<00:04:36.000> before

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
is to kind of take the bracelet before

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.640 
is to kind of take the bracelet before
you<00:04:36.419> crimp<00:04:36.660> the<00:04:36.780> other<00:04:36.930> end<00:04:37.169> and<00:04:37.380> kind<00:04:37.500> of

you crimp the other end and kind of

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.040 
you crimp the other end and kind of
crinkle<00:04:38.220> it<00:04:38.340> up<00:04:38.910> into<00:04:39.120> your<00:04:39.360> hand<00:04:39.630> and<00:04:39.840> that
