00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
but all of a sudden I was aware of

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.240 
but all of a sudden I was aware of
myself<00:00:15.230> meditating<00:00:16.230> in<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.410> room<00:00:19.250> everything

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
myself meditating in the room everything

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.500 
myself meditating in the room everything
was<00:00:20.460> clear<00:00:22.430> not<00:00:23.430> only<00:00:23.460> was<00:00:23.970> everything

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510

optically<00:00:25.260> clear<00:00:25.710> I<00:00:26.240> realized<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.510> air<00:00:27.750> was

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
optically clear I realized the air was

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.479 
optically clear I realized the air was
not<00:00:28.500> empty<00:00:29.449> it<00:00:30.449> was<00:00:31.230> filled<00:00:31.619> with<00:00:32.130> little

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
sparkles like those balls that they have

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.490 
sparkles like those balls that they have
christmas<00:00:36.030> time<00:00:36.239> that<00:00:36.480> you<00:00:36.600> turn<00:00:37.079> off<00:00:37.140> side

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
christmas time that you turn off side

sparkles<00:00:43.500> of<00:00:43.649> light<00:00:44.510> everywhere<00:00:45.510> I<00:00:46.879> realized

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
sparkles of light everywhere I realized

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.430 
sparkles of light everywhere I realized

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.400 
it was an entire world between the me
that<00:00:53.010> thought<00:00:53.280> I<00:00:53.340> was<00:00:53.699> looking<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.420> that<00:00:55.110> that

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
that thought I was looking and that that

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.950 
that thought I was looking and that that
I<00:00:55.710> thought<00:00:56.100> I<00:00:56.129> was<00:00:56.430> looking<00:00:56.670> at<00:00:58.609> and<00:00:59.960> then

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
I thought I was looking at and then

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.380 
I thought I was looking at and then
something<00:01:01.440> else<00:01:01.559> happened<00:01:02.190> I<00:01:05.270> don't<00:01:06.270> even

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
something else happened I don't even

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.080 
something else happened I don't even
know<00:01:06.630> how<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.810> speak<00:01:07.200> about<00:01:07.350> this<00:01:09.260> but<00:01:10.260> I<00:01:11.090> seem

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
know how to speak about this but I seem

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.550 
know how to speak about this but I seem
to<00:01:12.119> be<00:01:12.420> able<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:13.080> simultaneously<00:01:14.420> notice<00:01:15.560> from

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
to be able to simultaneously notice from

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.920 
to be able to simultaneously notice from
all<00:01:16.740> points<00:01:17.280> in<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.460> room<00:01:20.299> the<00:01:21.299> experience

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
all points in the room the experience

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.070 
all points in the room the experience
was<00:01:22.140> so<00:01:22.350> profound<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:23.280> when<00:01:24.270> I<00:01:24.299> was<00:01:24.570> asked

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
was so profound that when I was asked

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.109 
was so profound that when I was asked
about<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.350> later<00:01:25.770> I<00:01:25.890> said<00:01:26.250> I<00:01:26.400> felt<00:01:26.700> as<00:01:26.909> though<00:01:26.939> I

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
about it later I said I felt as though I

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.510 
about it later I said I felt as though I
had<00:01:27.450> become<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.110> sky<00:01:30.170> after<00:01:31.170> that<00:01:32.040> experience

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
had become the sky after that experience

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.310 
had become the sky after that experience
I<00:01:32.880> opened<00:01:33.750> my<00:01:33.900> eyes<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:35.840> my<00:01:36.840> eyesight<00:01:37.290> was

God<00:02:17.280> is<00:02:17.430> confused<00:02:17.970> as<00:02:18.180> my<00:02:18.390> patients<00:02:18.930> used<00:02:19.140> to

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:26.300 
God is confused as my patients used to
can<00:02:20.910> I<00:02:20.940> see<00:02:21.270> it<00:02:21.390> again<00:02:22.400> and<00:02:24.590> when<00:02:25.590> I<00:02:25.620> got<00:02:25.950> to<00:02:26.190> the

can I see it again and when I got to the

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.050 
can I see it again and when I got to the
optimal<00:02:26.940> prescription<00:02:27.870> I<00:02:28.130> was<00:02:29.130> sure<00:02:29.490> I<00:02:29.520> was

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
optimal prescription I was sure I was

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.360 
optimal prescription I was sure I was
going<00:02:30.330> to<00:02:30.540> step<00:02:30.840> out<00:02:31.050> from<00:02:31.290> behind<00:02:31.380> the<00:02:32.040> device

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
going to step out from behind the device

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.450 
going to step out from behind the device
and<00:02:32.760> it<00:02:33.570> would<00:02:33.750> save<00:02:33.960> Plano<00:02:34.560> zero<00:02:35.040> no

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
and it would save Plano zero no

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.900 
and it would save Plano zero no
prescription<00:02:36.830> but<00:02:37.830> instead<00:02:38.280> what<00:02:38.490> happened

prescription but the optical
measurements<00:03:02.670> of<00:03:02.820> my<00:03:03.030> eyes<00:03:03.210> had<00:03:03.720> not<00:03:04.050> changed

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.060 

it<00:03:10.320> took<00:03:10.620> a<00:03:10.650> while<00:03:10.980> for<00:03:11.040> me<00:03:11.490> to<00:03:11.730> realize<00:03:12.240> that

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
it took a while for me to realize that

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:17.140 
it took a while for me to realize that
that<00:03:14.070> could<00:03:14.130> only<00:03:14.520> mean<00:03:14.850> one<00:03:14.880> thing

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
that could only mean one thing

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:24.860 
that could only mean one thing
we<00:03:18.150> don't<00:03:18.390> see<00:03:18.660> from<00:03:18.960> the<00:03:19.080> eyes<00:03:19.230> I<00:03:23.870> then

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
we don't see from the eyes I then

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.220 
we don't see from the eyes I then
realized<00:03:25.440> that<00:03:25.680> there<00:03:25.950> was<00:03:26.160> nothing<00:03:26.520> in<00:03:27.230> the

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
realized that there was nothing in the

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.180 
realized that there was nothing in the
literature<00:03:28.890> that<00:03:29.840> could<00:03:30.840> even<00:03:31.230> explain<00:03:32.160> how

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
literature that could even explain how

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.660 
literature that could even explain how
it<00:03:32.790> was<00:03:32.940> possible<00:03:33.240> for<00:03:33.690> the<00:03:33.990> brain<00:03:34.640> to<00:03:35.640> change

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
it was possible for the brain to change

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:41.420 
it was possible for the brain to change
that<00:03:36.270> quickly<00:03:37.610> so<00:03:38.610> the<00:03:38.760> realization<00:03:39.150> is<00:03:40.430> the

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
that quickly so the realization is the

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.580 
that quickly so the realization is the
seeing<00:03:41.760> is<00:03:42.060> not<00:03:42.090> only<00:03:42.480> not<00:03:42.750> occurring<00:03:43.200> in<00:03:43.470> the

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
seeing is not only not occurring in the

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.580 
seeing is not only not occurring in the
eye<00:03:44.120> it's<00:03:45.120> not<00:03:45.390> occurring<00:03:45.930> in<00:03:46.050> the<00:03:46.170> physical

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
eye it's not occurring in the physical

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.950 
eye it's not occurring in the physical
machine
