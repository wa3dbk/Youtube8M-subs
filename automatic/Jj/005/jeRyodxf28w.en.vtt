00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:56.240 

and<00:01:49.500> here<00:01:50.500> is<00:01:50.860> the<00:01:51.670> wii<00:01:51.880> menu<00:01:52.060> on<00:01:52.630> the<00:01:52.689> gamepad

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.249 

now<00:01:57.250> you<00:01:57.430> can't<00:01:57.790> necessarily<00:01:58.390> do<00:01:58.840> anything

00:01:59.249 --> 00:01:59.259 
now you can't necessarily do anything

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:00.300 
now you can't necessarily do anything
with<00:01:59.380> the<00:01:59.470> game<00:01:59.650> package<00:01:59.860> that<00:02:00.040> sentry

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
with the game package that sentry

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.190 
with the game package that sentry
software<00:02:00.790> it<00:02:00.880> cannot<00:02:01.180> be<00:02:01.390> controlled<00:02:01.869> with

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
software it cannot be controlled with

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.350 
software it cannot be controlled with
the<00:02:02.530> wii<00:02:02.649> u<00:02:02.799> gamepad<00:02:03.369> so<00:02:03.790> you<00:02:03.880> can<00:02:04.090> even<00:02:04.210> at

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
the wii u gamepad so you can even at

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.080

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
could actually point at the gamepad and

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:12.930

there told you will see far away and
yeah

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.630 

as<00:03:16.200> we<00:03:16.530> all<00:03:16.650> know<00:03:16.680> u<00:03:16.980> gamepad<00:03:17.460> and<00:03:19.280> I<00:03:20.280> think

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
as we all know u gamepad and I think

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:28.010 
as we all know u gamepad and I think
it's<00:03:20.880> a<00:03:21.180> little<00:03:21.450> bit<00:03:21.630> faster<00:03:22.140> as<00:03:22.890> well<00:03:26.780> we<00:03:27.780> go

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
it's a little bit faster as well we go

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.760 
it's a little bit faster as well we go
back<00:03:28.230> to<00:03:28.470> the<00:03:28.590> Wii<00:03:28.800> U<00:03:28.980> menu<00:03:29.160> a<00:03:29.750> lopes<00:03:30.750> faster<00:03:31.530> I

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
back to the Wii U menu a lopes faster I

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:52.270 
back to the Wii U menu a lopes faster I
believe

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.750 

so<00:03:53.280> yeah<00:03:53.459> loads<00:03:53.730> faster<00:03:54.420> and<00:03:54.659> jump<00:03:55.580> so<00:03:56.580> yeah

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
so yeah loads faster and jump so yeah

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.220
