00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.370
 so let's say yet another the nth 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.390
 record of goal goals here in England 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:11.429
 beautiful a touch of billiards sky 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:13.920
 you want to comment on Italian as a souvenir 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.049
 not only is the ball still missing 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.900
 depth 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.410
 there will also be the concierge with a 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.410
 touch of exterior 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.350
 knowing that it is not the left this is 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.689
 the Rome from champions that always marked 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:32.300
 because this is a true test it is 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:35.150
 important test is significant that 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:39.190
 we knew we were facing a team 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:43.309
 europe fort come here is a game 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:45.320
 I think the last one for a great team 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.059
 me what juventus will have thought is 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.480
 tonight with this performance of the 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:54.680
 Rome, but honestly I do n't know what it has 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:56.890
 thought, however, they know their strength 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:01.070
 they know they gave strength for what 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:04.070
 they think of ourselves and us from today 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:06.560
 onwards we will think of coming for us is one 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.160
 very nice match with another 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.410
 photography 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:14.750
 after the crisis francesco is your gift 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:17.240
 birthday gift beautiful 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.250
 you were expecting the proof like that 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.080
 I dreamed of a proof that generally a 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.290
 such goals 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.160
 what is there I was hoping to score before 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.590
 possible 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.780
 in these days we do not mark 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.870
 people expected it 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.270
 but I have always said I think more about the 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:37.910
 team that to myself when they arrive 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.950
 the results also by delivering the 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:43.470
 himself passed the maturity exam 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:46.740
 this rome has agreed so I think 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:52.410
 this evening to show every of 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:55.380
 be different from played containment 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:58.350
 strong and well organized that he did not have 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.330
 fear of nobody 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:05.330
 as I said before impose the game on 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.330
 manchester simple if what then fill 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:14.180
 that tweet those messages from the city that 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:16.890
 they did a great dinner for me but 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.800
 you simply don't want the architect 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.620
 does not use 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.040
 just so it was that he brought 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.500
 luck 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.900
 that's why then I type the states that you 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:31.130
 missing this was the first sweet 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:33.800
 time you make me so beautiful handsome 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:37.850
 nice performance 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.320
 but not before everything 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.590
 as I said before I am happy with the 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:44.420
 team because it has proven to have a 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.790
 big group with a big big one 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.340
 strength and above all the field 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:54.950
 international is not easy to set up 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:58.100
 exaggerated provision to say that this 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.610
 We passed around went forward 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:04.730
 at first they all gave us up for dead 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:07.340
 however these two first matches we have 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.800
 demonstrated to be able to play accomplished 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.130
 even if the strongest team still doesn't 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:16.030
 we met though 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:18.360
 among the top three and I think if it is certain 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.160
 what can he teach 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.890
 I do 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.940
 no games have to see us 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:29.810
 they must calmly understand 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:33.620
 how to behave 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:35.989
 respect for the milan versions therefore the 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:41.420
 based on Sunday the juventus spoke to me 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:44.239
 even garcia just now can be a 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.530
 warning you could be a 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:50.380
 warning but we know 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:53.269
 the team she is afraid of 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:56.900
 the strong team for me the team 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:04:00.110
 stronger than Italy because champions 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:02.620
 winners to go to turin and do the 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.620
 our game
