the<00:01:45.240> labels<00:01:45.570> we<00:01:46.229> cut<00:01:46.470> them<00:01:46.620> where<00:01:46.740> everyone

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
the labels we cut them where everyone

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.920 
the labels we cut them where everyone
vertically<00:01:47.460> using<00:01:47.790> torches<00:01:48.060> again<00:01:48.630> using

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
vertically using torches again using

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.690 
vertically using torches again using
torches<00:01:49.170> we<00:01:49.440> melt<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.860> rims<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.280> just<00:01:50.610> the

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
torches we melt the rims and just the

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.670 
torches we melt the rims and just the
rims<00:01:50.909> which<00:01:51.120> is<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.390> hardest<00:01:51.720> part<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.080> then

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
rims which is the hardest part and then

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.260 
rims which is the hardest part and then
we<00:01:52.799> stress<00:01:53.100> relieve<00:01:53.400> them<00:01:53.520> in<00:01:53.610> an<00:01:53.729> oven<00:01:53.909> called

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
we stress relieve them in an oven called

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.060 
we stress relieve them in an oven called
annealing<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:55.260> so<00:01:55.409> that's<00:01:55.560> so<00:01:55.950> they're

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
annealing and so that's so they're

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.530 
annealing and so that's so they're
completely<00:01:56.400> dishwasher<00:01:56.640> safe<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.330> then<00:01:57.450> we

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
completely dishwasher safe and then we

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.630 
completely dishwasher safe and then we
wash<00:01:57.720> and<00:01:57.750> we<00:01:57.960> pack<00:01:58.140> them<00:01:58.290> so<00:01:58.770> can<00:01:58.920> we<00:01:59.010> see<00:01:59.220> yeah

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640

let's go No he won't let us back there

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.080 
let's go No he won't let us back there

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
because it's a very proprietary process

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.290 
because it's a very proprietary process
so<00:02:06.659> we<00:02:06.750> have<00:02:06.869> to<00:02:06.990> respect<00:02:07.320> that<00:02:07.380> but<00:02:07.950> I
