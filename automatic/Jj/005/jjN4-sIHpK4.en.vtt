are you know we got our inbox gets
flooded<00:00:33.809> with<00:00:34.080> what<00:00:34.290> happened<00:00:34.710> where<00:00:34.830> are

00:00:34.939 --> 00:00:34.949 
flooded with what happened where are

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:36.590 
flooded with what happened where are
these<00:00:35.100> figures<00:00:35.400> how<00:00:35.730> come<00:00:35.879> I<00:00:35.970> can<00:00:36.150> order<00:00:36.330> them

these figures how come I can order them

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.079 
these figures how come I can order them
well<00:00:38.479> we<00:00:39.479> love<00:00:39.750> what<00:00:39.960> we<00:00:40.049> showed<00:00:40.519> but<00:00:41.519> we<00:00:41.909> are

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:42.089 
well we love what we showed but we are

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:48.020 
well we love what we showed but we are
having<00:00:42.449> some<00:00:42.930> internal<00:00:45.170> questions<00:00:46.170> as<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:47.030> the

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
having some internal questions as to the

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.380 
having some internal questions as to the
balance<00:00:48.510> of<00:00:50.030> articulation<00:00:51.320> versus<00:00:53.119> the<00:00:54.119> the

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
balance of articulation versus the the

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.869 
balance of articulation versus the the
cleanness<00:00:55.080> of<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.409> look<00:00:55.619> the<00:00:55.830> visual<00:00:56.220> look<00:00:56.699> of

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
cleanness of the look the visual look of

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.509 
cleanness of the look the visual look of
the<00:00:56.940> figure<00:00:57.799> you<00:00:58.799> know<00:00:58.920> hot<00:00:59.220> toys<00:00:59.519> will<00:01:00.449> have

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:01.519 
the figure you know hot toys will have

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:05.780 
the figure you know hot toys will have
for<00:01:02.519> example<00:01:02.940> on<00:01:03.059> an<00:01:03.150> arm<00:01:04.159> hot<00:01:05.159> toys<00:01:05.430> will<00:01:05.640> have

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
for example on an arm hot toys will have

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.390 
for example on an arm hot toys will have
a<00:01:05.820> full<00:01:06.299> rubber<00:01:07.020> sleeve<00:01:07.439> with<00:01:08.250> the

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
a full rubber sleeve with the

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.460 
a full rubber sleeve with the
articulation<00:01:08.700> inside<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.900> arm<00:01:10.110> so<00:01:10.260> you

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
articulation inside of the arm so you

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.600 
articulation inside of the arm so you
don't<00:01:10.710> see<00:01:11.010> any<00:01:11.190> articulation<00:01:13.220> that<00:01:14.220> looks

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
don't see any articulation that looks

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.240 
don't see any articulation that looks
great<00:01:14.940> but<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.660> the<00:01:16.200> level<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.680> movement<00:01:17.130> you

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
great but the the level of movement you

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.020 
great but the the level of movement you
get<00:01:17.400> is<00:01:17.550> limited<00:01:17.990> so<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.770> know<00:01:19.890> our<00:01:20.220> question

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
get is limited so you know our question

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.600 
get is limited so you know our question
is<00:01:21.180> for<00:01:21.330> Street<00:01:21.660> Fighter<00:01:21.690> 1/6<00:01:22.560> scale<00:01:22.680> what's

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
is for Street Fighter 1/6 scale what's

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.990 
is for Street Fighter 1/6 scale what's
more<00:01:23.910> important<00:01:24.530> the<00:01:25.530> clean<00:01:25.920> look<00:01:26.250> of<00:01:26.490> having

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
more important the clean look of having

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.300 
more important the clean look of having
a<00:01:27.210> smooth<00:01:27.570> arm<00:01:27.960> that<00:01:28.230> looks<00:01:28.380> real<00:01:28.680> but<00:01:29.190> with

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
a smooth arm that looks real but with

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.250 
a smooth arm that looks real but with
limited<00:01:29.730> articulation<00:01:29.880> for<00:01:30.690> example<00:01:31.110> you

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:31.260 
limited articulation for example you

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.440 
limited articulation for example you
wouldn't<00:01:31.440> be<00:01:31.560> able<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.830> do<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:31.980> Hadouken<00:01:32.550> pose<00:01:33.150> a

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
wouldn't be able to do a Hadouken pose a

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.930 
wouldn't be able to do a Hadouken pose a
full<00:01:33.810> Hadouken<00:01:34.260> pose<00:01:34.640> at<00:01:35.640> least<00:01:35.850> the

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:35.940 
full Hadouken pose at least the

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.160 
full Hadouken pose at least the
beginning<00:01:36.060> of<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.450> Hadouken<00:01:36.900> when<00:01:37.020> you're

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
beginning of the Hadouken when you're

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.140 
beginning of the Hadouken when you're
forming<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:39.830> versus<00:01:40.830> having<00:01:41.430> an<00:01:41.760> actual

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
forming the versus having an actual

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.470 
forming the versus having an actual
exposed<00:01:42.840> articulation<00:01:43.770> joint<00:01:44.040> this<00:01:45.030> is<00:01:45.090> our

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:45.480 
exposed articulation joint this is our

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:50.390 
exposed articulation joint this is our
prototype<00:01:46.020> of<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:47.340> arm<00:01:47.670> for<00:01:48.630> Rio<00:01:48.979> you<00:01:49.979> can<00:01:50.190> see

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400 
prototype of the arm for Rio you can see

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.580 
prototype of the arm for Rio you can see
there's<00:01:50.610> a<00:01:50.670> it's<00:01:50.970> broken<00:01:51.270> but<00:01:51.900> there's<00:01:52.890> joint

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
there's a it's broken but there's joint

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.899 
there's a it's broken but there's joint
that<00:01:55.220> would<00:01:55.340> be<00:01:55.460> exposed<00:01:57.340> but<00:01:58.340> you<00:01:58.549> would<00:01:58.670> get

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
that would be exposed but you would get

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:01.929 
that would be exposed but you would get
a<00:01:59.090> lot<00:01:59.329> more<00:01:59.630> movement<00:02:00.020> than<00:02:00.470> you<00:02:00.619> would<00:02:00.860> if<00:02:01.610> it

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
a lot more movement than you would if it

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:05.590 
a lot more movement than you would if it
was<00:02:02.060> a<00:02:02.119> full<00:02:02.360> rubber<00:02:02.600> sleeve<00:02:03.640> so<00:02:04.640> you<00:02:05.450> know

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
was a full rubber sleeve so you know

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.870 
was a full rubber sleeve so you know
that's<00:02:05.930> what's<00:02:06.170> caused<00:02:06.439> the<00:02:06.680> delay<00:02:06.880> the

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
that's what's caused the delay the

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.639 
that's what's caused the delay the
factory's<00:02:08.330> been<00:02:08.360> working<00:02:08.929> we've<00:02:09.080> been<00:02:09.259> doing

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
factory's been working we've been doing

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.190 
factory's been working we've been doing
tests<00:02:10.069> and<00:02:10.190> things<00:02:10.340> like<00:02:10.550> that<00:02:10.819> but<00:02:11.090> I<00:02:11.330> haven't

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
tests and things like that but I haven't

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.960 
tests and things like that but I haven't
been<00:02:12.440> able<00:02:12.560> to<00:02:13.120> commit<00:02:14.120> to<00:02:14.959> one<00:02:14.989> or<00:02:15.380> the<00:02:15.530> other

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
been able to commit to one or the other

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.100 
been able to commit to one or the other
so<00:02:16.970> I'm<00:02:17.090> very<00:02:17.209> interested<00:02:17.390> in<00:02:17.810> hearing<00:02:18.019> what

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
so I'm very interested in hearing what

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.740 
so I'm very interested in hearing what
the<00:02:18.410> fans<00:02:18.650> think<00:02:19.480> particularly<00:02:20.480> if<00:02:20.630> you

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
the fans think particularly if you

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.880 
the fans think particularly if you
actually<00:02:20.959> do<00:02:21.380> buy<00:02:21.560> six<00:02:21.890> scale<00:02:22.130> figures<00:02:23.319> if<00:02:24.319> you

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
actually do buy six scale figures if you

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.270 
actually do buy six scale figures if you
feel<00:02:25.130> yes<00:02:25.489> you<00:02:26.360> know<00:02:26.510> the<00:02:27.440> look<00:02:27.680> is<00:02:27.950> more

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
feel yes you know the look is more

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.340 
feel yes you know the look is more
important<00:02:28.670> than<00:02:28.790> full<00:02:29.150> mobility<00:02:29.510> on<00:02:30.110> the

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
important than full mobility on the

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.050 
important than full mobility on the
figure<00:02:30.880> here<00:02:31.880> is<00:02:32.530> the<00:02:33.530> little<00:02:34.400> scratched<00:02:34.790> up

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
figure here is the little scratched up

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.470 
figure here is the little scratched up
but<00:02:35.239> this<00:02:35.360> is<00:02:35.420> the<00:02:35.630> prototype<00:02:36.170> of<00:02:36.200> the<00:02:36.470> head<00:02:36.709> of

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
but this is the prototype of the head of

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.930 
but this is the prototype of the head of
really<00:02:38.480> you<00:02:38.600> can<00:02:38.780> see<00:02:38.930> the<00:02:39.049> quality<00:02:39.880> it's<00:02:40.880> very

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
really you can see the quality it's very

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:47.890 
really you can see the quality it's very
nice<00:02:41.360> got<00:02:41.870> the<00:02:42.049> the<00:02:42.739> fabric<00:02:42.980> headband<00:02:46.900> I'm

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
nice got the the fabric headband I'm

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.089 
nice got the the fabric headband I'm
pretty<00:02:48.200> happy<00:02:48.410> with<00:02:48.620> it<00:02:49.599> but<00:02:50.599> yeah<00:02:51.110> so<00:02:51.470> the<00:02:51.860> six

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:52.099 
pretty happy with it but yeah so the six

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:53.110 
pretty happy with it but yeah so the six
scale<00:02:52.310> is<00:02:52.489> a<00:02:52.519> big<00:02:52.730> deal

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
scale is a big deal

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.390 
scale is a big deal
my<00:02:53.510> plan<00:02:53.810> is<00:02:54.160> to<00:02:56.860> limit<00:02:57.860> the<00:02:57.980> time<00:02:58.010> between

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
my plan is to limit the time between

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.880 
my plan is to limit the time between
pre-order<00:02:59.060> and<00:02:59.209> deliveries<00:02:59.660> so<00:02:59.959> the

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
pre-order and deliveries so the

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.979 
pre-order and deliveries so the
pre-order<00:03:01.370> is<00:03:01.459> scheduled<00:03:02.000> to<00:03:02.120> go<00:03:02.269> up<00:03:02.299> either

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
pre-order is scheduled to go up either

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.229 
pre-order is scheduled to go up either
late<00:03:03.320> late<00:03:03.500> this<00:03:03.680> year<00:03:03.739> or<00:03:03.980> early<00:03:04.190> early<00:03:04.760> 2016

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
late late this year or early early 2016

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:07.930 
late late this year or early early 2016
with<00:03:06.230> delivery<00:03:06.680> only<00:03:07.010> two<00:03:07.280> or<00:03:07.430> three<00:03:07.459> months

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
with delivery only two or three months

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.690 
with delivery only two or three months
after<00:03:08.269> that<00:03:08.299> the<00:03:09.049> reason<00:03:09.859> we<00:03:09.980> can<00:03:10.160> do<00:03:10.310> that<00:03:10.340> is

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
after that the reason we can do that is

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.809 
after that the reason we can do that is
because<00:03:11.410> as<00:03:12.410> opposed<00:03:12.799> to<00:03:12.890> the<00:03:13.040> statues<00:03:13.549> where

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
because as opposed to the statues where

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:15.640 
because as opposed to the statues where
we<00:03:14.060> show<00:03:14.299> a<00:03:14.329> prototype<00:03:14.900> design<00:03:15.170> we<00:03:15.290> set<00:03:15.500> it<00:03:15.620> to

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
we show a prototype design we set it to

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.920 
we show a prototype design we set it to
the<00:03:15.829> factory<00:03:16.190> and<00:03:16.370> begin<00:03:16.640> production<00:03:16.880> we<00:03:17.840> are

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
the factory and begin production we are

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.559 
the factory and begin production we are
already<00:03:18.170> working<00:03:18.440> on<00:03:18.739> these<00:03:18.950> in<00:03:19.190> China<00:03:19.489> and<00:03:19.819> by

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:20.569 
already working on these in China and by

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:22.690 
already working on these in China and by
the<00:03:20.630> time<00:03:21.049> we<00:03:21.200> do<00:03:21.380> the<00:03:21.530> pre-order<00:03:22.069> we<00:03:22.549> will

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
the time we do the pre-order we will

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.970 
the time we do the pre-order we will
have<00:03:22.880> been<00:03:23.030> well<00:03:23.299> into<00:03:23.720> production<00:03:24.049> on<00:03:24.410> them

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
have been well into production on them

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.479 
have been well into production on them
in<00:03:25.220> China<00:03:25.760> and<00:03:26.209> China<00:03:26.540> so<00:03:26.930> the<00:03:27.859> delivery<00:03:28.190> will

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
in China and China so the delivery will

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:32.110 
in China and China so the delivery will
only<00:03:28.639> be<00:03:28.819> a<00:03:28.850> few<00:03:29.060> months<00:03:29.359> later<00:03:29.950> the<00:03:30.950> line<00:03:31.459> the

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
only be a few months later the line the

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.420 
only be a few months later the line the
six<00:03:32.359> scale<00:03:32.540> line<00:03:32.750> is<00:03:32.930> huge<00:03:33.200> I<00:03:33.560> mean<00:03:33.859> we<00:03:33.980> have<00:03:34.190> so

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
six scale line is huge I mean we have so

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.590 
six scale line is huge I mean we have so
many<00:03:34.549> figures<00:03:34.819> planned<00:03:35.269> and<00:03:35.630> being<00:03:35.900> sculpted

can't tell if it's alright but uh you
know<00:04:34.980> this<00:04:35.400> is<00:04:35.550> the<00:04:35.669> scowl<00:04:35.940> so<00:04:36.180> it's<00:04:36.300> 12<00:04:36.570> inch

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
know this is the scowl so it's 12 inch

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.880 
know this is the scowl so it's 12 inch
scale<00:04:37.400> same<00:04:38.400> as<00:04:38.520> hot<00:04:38.880> toys<00:04:39.240> and<00:04:39.720> all<00:04:40.320> the<00:04:40.650> all

the cool 1/6 scale figures that are out
right<00:04:42.810> now<00:04:44.240> so<00:04:45.240> it's<00:04:45.660> too<00:04:45.960> design-wise<00:04:46.560> it's<00:04:46.800> a

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100
