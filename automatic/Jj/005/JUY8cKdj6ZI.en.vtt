00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
easy let's go and check out the pocket

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.330 
easy let's go and check out the pocket
clip<00:02:06.780> here<00:02:06.960> so<00:02:07.560> you<00:02:07.649> notice<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:07.890> pocket<00:02:08.220> clip

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
clip here so you notice the pocket clip

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.520 
clip here so you notice the pocket clip
is<00:02:08.520> a<00:02:08.580> very<00:02:08.849> low<00:02:09.030> carry<00:02:09.330> not<00:02:10.020> as<00:02:10.140> low<00:02:10.259> carries

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
is a very low carry not as low carries

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.800 
is a very low carry not as low carries
the<00:02:10.619> kiyose<00:02:11.039> but<00:02:11.700> it<00:02:11.790> pretty<00:02:11.970> much<00:02:12.090> flush<00:02:12.480> with

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
the kiyose but it pretty much flush with

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.700 
the kiyose but it pretty much flush with
the

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
the

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.760 
the
with<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:14.010> handle<00:02:14.700> scale<00:02:14.940> here<00:02:15.210> is<00:02:15.360> very<00:02:15.990> slim

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
with the handle scale here is very slim

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.200 
with the handle scale here is very slim
profile<00:02:17.190> too<00:02:17.340> because<00:02:17.550> the<00:02:17.670> kiyose<00:02:17.940> was<00:02:18.090> like

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
profile too because the kiyose was like

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:19.880 
profile too because the kiyose was like
this<00:02:18.360> big<00:02:18.420> tall<00:02:18.840> pocket<00:02:19.320> clip<00:02:19.470> whereas<00:02:19.800> this

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
this big tall pocket clip whereas this

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.010 
this big tall pocket clip whereas this
one<00:02:19.950> is<00:02:20.220> a<00:02:20.250> lot<00:02:20.490> slimmer<00:02:20.790> you<00:02:21.480> know<00:02:21.600> it<00:02:21.840> is

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
one is a lot slimmer you know it is

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.920 
one is a lot slimmer you know it is
strong<00:02:22.380> you<00:02:23.340> know<00:02:23.460> so<00:02:23.820> it's<00:02:23.850> a<00:02:24.330> very<00:02:24.600> nice

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
strong you know so it's a very nice

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.500 
strong you know so it's a very nice
pocket<00:02:25.320> clip<00:02:25.440> I<00:02:25.590> think<00:02:25.820> three<00:02:26.820> screws<00:02:27.150> hold<00:02:27.390> it

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
pocket clip I think three screws hold it

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:28.850 
pocket clip I think three screws hold it
together<00:02:27.600> you<00:02:27.900> can<00:02:28.020> remove<00:02:28.230> if<00:02:28.380> you<00:02:28.470> want<00:02:28.680> but

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
together you can remove if you want but

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.440 
together you can remove if you want but
of<00:02:28.980> course<00:02:29.130> you<00:02:29.220> want<00:02:29.370> to<00:02:29.430> remove<00:02:29.640> it<00:02:29.820> it's<00:02:30.300> not

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
of course you want to remove it it's not

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.060 
of course you want to remove it it's not
tap<00:02:30.750> anywhere<00:02:30.990> else<00:02:31.320> where<00:02:31.650> you<00:02:31.740> can<00:02:31.860> reattach

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
tap anywhere else where you can reattach

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.310 
tap anywhere else where you can reattach
again<00:02:32.520> so<00:02:32.700> it<00:02:32.790> is<00:02:33.000> only<00:02:33.360> right-handed<00:02:34.110> tip

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
again so it is only right-handed tip

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.550 
again so it is only right-handed tip
down<00:02:34.470> carry<00:02:35.930> the<00:02:36.930> beautiful<00:02:37.230> thing<00:02:37.350> about<00:02:37.380> the

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
down carry the beautiful thing about the

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.560 
down carry the beautiful thing about the
pocket<00:02:37.830> clip<00:02:37.950> is<00:02:38.100> that<00:02:38.280> it<00:02:38.430> does<00:02:38.850> overlap<00:02:39.270> the

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
pocket clip is that it does overlap the

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.660 
pocket clip is that it does overlap the
frame<00:02:39.870> lock<00:02:40.050> and<00:02:40.380> see<00:02:40.950> a<00:02:40.980> little<00:02:41.280> pointy

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
frame lock and see a little pointy

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.630 
frame lock and see a little pointy
little<00:02:41.910> point<00:02:42.690> here<00:02:42.930> that<00:02:42.960> were<00:02:43.200> kind<00:02:43.410> of

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
little point here that were kind of

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.800 
little point here that were kind of
doesn't<00:02:44.640> line<00:02:44.760> up<00:02:44.790> with<00:02:44.940> the<00:02:45.060> with<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:45.570> frame

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
doesn't line up with the with the frame

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.050 
doesn't line up with the with the frame
itself<00:02:45.960> this<00:02:46.410> acts<00:02:46.650> like<00:02:46.860> a<00:02:46.890> lock<00:02:47.130> stop<00:02:47.430> so

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
itself this acts like a lock stop so

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.660 
itself this acts like a lock stop so
when<00:02:48.630> you<00:02:48.720> have<00:02:48.840> this<00:02:48.960> open<00:02:49.110> if<00:02:49.830> you<00:02:49.980> if<00:02:50.190> i<00:02:50.310> push

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
when you have this open if you if i push

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.700 
when you have this open if you if i push
it<00:02:50.700> see<00:02:51.270> here<00:02:51.450> see<00:02:51.750> it<00:02:51.840> doesn't<00:02:52.110> it<00:02:52.380> doesn't<00:02:52.440> go

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
it see here see it doesn't it doesn't go

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.290 
it see here see it doesn't it doesn't go
past<00:02:52.890> this<00:02:53.100> point<00:02:53.340> because<00:02:53.850> this<00:02:54.060> part<00:02:54.240> is

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
past this point because this part is

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.550 
past this point because this part is
putting<00:02:54.390> pressure<00:02:54.630> on<00:02:54.870> it<00:02:55.050> and<00:02:55.200> then<00:02:55.380> this

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
putting pressure on it and then this

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.590 
putting pressure on it and then this
part<00:02:55.770> overlaps<00:02:56.280> it<00:02:56.490> and<00:02:56.640> keeps<00:02:56.820> the<00:02:57.030> locking

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
part overlaps it and keeps the locking

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:58.790 
part overlaps it and keeps the locking
bar<00:02:57.750> there<00:02:57.960> so<00:02:58.140> it's<00:02:58.230> very<00:02:58.320> nice<00:02:58.530> they

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
bar there so it's very nice they

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.430 
bar there so it's very nice they
incorporated<00:02:59.370> that<00:02:59.640> into<00:02:59.700> design<00:03:00.210> now<00:03:01.140> I<00:03:01.170> have

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
incorporated that into design now I have

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.750 
incorporated that into design now I have
been<00:03:01.710> playing<00:03:01.950> with<00:03:02.070> this<00:03:02.130> a<00:03:02.250> lot<00:03:02.430> although<00:03:02.640> it

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
been playing with this a lot although it

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:03.860 
been playing with this a lot although it
doesn't<00:03:02.880> look<00:03:03.060> like<00:03:03.270> it<00:03:03.390> because<00:03:03.480> look<00:03:03.720> look

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
doesn't look like it because look look

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.320 
doesn't look like it because look look
where<00:03:04.020> the<00:03:04.080> lock-up<00:03:04.470> is<00:03:04.650> still<00:03:04.920> so<00:03:05.340> it's<00:03:06.030> a

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
where the lock-up is still so it's a

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.720 
where the lock-up is still so it's a

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.710 
percent maybe it's not even not a lot
but<00:03:11.040> it<00:03:11.340> still<00:03:11.640> locked<00:03:11.820> up<00:03:11.940> tight<00:03:12.150> it<00:03:12.390> doesn't

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
but it still locked up tight it doesn't

gotten to fold on me yet so let's hope

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.730 
gotten to fold on me yet so let's hope
it<00:03:15.510> doesn't<00:03:15.630> happen<00:03:15.810> so<00:03:16.170> keep<00:03:16.440> on<00:03:16.530> playing

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
this but I got rid of the crunchiness so

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.110 
this but I got rid of the crunchiness so
the<00:03:19.470> crunchies<00:03:19.860> the<00:03:20.130> the<00:03:20.430> little<00:03:20.670> clicking

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
the crunchies the the little clicking

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.770 
the crunchies the the little clicking
sound<00:03:21.360> went<00:03:21.870> away<00:03:21.930> so<00:03:22.710> hey<00:03:23.280> at<00:03:23.910> least<00:03:23.970> it<00:03:24.360> it

sound went away so hey at least it it

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.900 
sound went away so hey at least it it
opens<00:03:25.110> a<00:03:25.170> lot<00:03:25.320> smoother<00:03:25.620> down<00:03:25.830> and<00:03:26.100> disengages

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
opens a lot smoother down and disengages

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.360 
opens a lot smoother down and disengages
lot<00:03:27.060> smoother<00:03:27.420> it<00:03:28.350> does<00:03:28.530> say<00:03:28.710> AG<00:03:29.040> russell

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
lot smoother it does say AG russell

at<00:03:38.250> that<00:03:38.340> nice<00:03:38.550> point<00:03:38.940> that<00:03:39.090> this<00:03:39.180> thing<00:03:39.390> comes

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
at that nice point that this thing comes

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.310 
at that nice point that this thing comes
to<00:03:40.250> and<00:03:41.250> now<00:03:41.640> the<00:03:41.700> thumb<00:03:41.940> studs<00:03:42.210> are<00:03:42.360> very<00:03:43.110> very

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
to and now the thumb studs are very very

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.960 
to and now the thumb studs are very very
good<00:03:43.560> let<00:03:43.800> me<00:03:43.830> show<00:03:43.980> you<00:03:44.010> these<00:03:44.190> really<00:03:44.820> quick

good let me show you these really quick
so<00:03:45.120> you<00:03:45.150> see<00:03:45.510> where<00:03:45.660> the<00:03:45.980> the<00:03:46.980> handle<00:03:47.550> scales

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
so you see where the the handle scales

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.640 
so you see where the the handle scales
are<00:03:47.940> so<00:03:48.390> notice<00:03:48.570> how<00:03:48.630> the<00:03:48.690> thumper<00:03:49.260> true<00:03:49.440> pass

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
are so notice how the thumper true pass

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.470 
are so notice how the thumper true pass
to<00:03:49.800> handle<00:03:49.890> scales<00:03:50.190> it's<00:03:50.760> perfect<00:03:51.000> I<00:03:51.330> mean

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
to handle scales it's perfect I mean

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.480 
to handle scales it's perfect I mean
your<00:03:51.630> thumb<00:03:51.900> always<00:03:52.440> is<00:03:52.650> able<00:03:53.100> to<00:03:53.190> get<00:03:53.280> to<00:03:53.460> them

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:53.490 
your thumb always is able to get to them

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:55.580 
your thumb always is able to get to them
you<00:03:54.030> know<00:03:54.060> there's<00:03:54.600> like<00:03:54.750> there's<00:03:54.960> like<00:03:55.080> no

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
you know there's like there's like no

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:56.870 
you know there's like there's like no
reason<00:03:55.620> why<00:03:55.950> you<00:03:55.980> can't<00:03:56.220> get<00:03:56.280> the<00:03:56.400> thumb<00:03:56.610> studs

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
reason why you can't get the thumb studs

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.090 
reason why you can't get the thumb studs
you<00:03:57.180> know<00:03:57.330> so<00:03:57.660> Hannah<00:03:58.530> lock<00:03:58.680> scales<00:03:58.920> are<00:03:58.980> both

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
you know so Hannah lock scales are both

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.220 
you know so Hannah lock scales are both
ends<00:03:59.370> thumb<00:03:59.670> studs<00:03:59.940> are<00:04:00.060> really<00:04:00.240> long<00:04:00.420> so<00:04:00.810> very

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
ends thumb studs are really long so very

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.680 
ends thumb studs are really long so very
very<00:04:01.440> good<00:04:01.590> on<00:04:01.740> the<00:04:01.800> thumb<00:04:01.980> studs<00:04:02.220> alright<00:04:03.120> so

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
let me show you how this thing opens

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.240 
let me show you how this thing opens
here<00:04:06.080> so<00:04:07.080> I've<00:04:07.440> loosened<00:04:07.770> it<00:04:07.980> up<00:04:08.040> completely

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
here so I've loosened it up completely

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.270 
here so I've loosened it up completely
so<00:04:08.580> watch<00:04:08.910> this<00:04:09.230> look<00:04:10.230> how<00:04:10.320> fast<00:04:10.770> that<00:04:11.010> swings

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
so watch this look how fast that swings

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.740 
so watch this look how fast that swings
out<00:04:11.430> now<00:04:11.610> and<00:04:11.880> it's<00:04:12.090> completely<00:04:12.480> I'm

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
out now and it's completely I'm

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.600 
out now and it's completely I'm
ambidextrous<00:04:13.080> look<00:04:13.830> no<00:04:14.010> risk<00:04:14.250> look<00:04:14.400> at<00:04:14.490> all

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
ambidextrous look no risk look at all

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.960 
ambidextrous look no risk look at all
now<00:04:15.090> this<00:04:15.300> is<00:04:15.360> by<00:04:15.660> no<00:04:15.720> means<00:04:15.840> as<00:04:16.230> a<00:04:16.260> as<00:04:17.160> smooth

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
now this is by no means as a as smooth

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.380 
now this is by no means as a as smooth
as<00:04:18.150> Maya<00:04:18.299> keas<00:04:18.750> but<00:04:19.380> I<00:04:19.590> mean<00:04:19.859> look<00:04:20.390> left-handed

no problems and it can be used

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.270 
no problems and it can be used
ambidextrous<00:04:24.120> lee<00:04:24.360> so<00:04:24.930> and<00:04:25.290> because<00:04:25.950> of<00:04:26.100> this

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
ambidextrous lee so and because of this

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.500 
ambidextrous lee so and because of this
nice<00:04:26.460> recurve

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
nice recurve

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.840 
nice recurve
nala<00:04:27.990> just<00:04:28.230> is<00:04:28.380> maybe<00:04:29.070> the<00:04:29.220> blade<00:04:29.550> is<00:04:29.640> really

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
nala just is maybe the blade is really

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:31.250 
nala just is maybe the blade is really
thin<00:04:30.060> first<00:04:30.390> of<00:04:30.510> all<00:04:30.600> so<00:04:30.780> it's<00:04:30.900> very<00:04:31.080> good<00:04:31.200> for

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
thin first of all so it's very good for

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.230 
thin first of all so it's very good for
piercing<00:04:31.740> but<00:04:31.860> this<00:04:31.980> recurve<00:04:32.430> affords<00:04:32.880> a<00:04:32.940> lot

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
piercing but this recurve affords a lot

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.770
