00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
periods i think it's settled down a

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.499 
periods i think it's settled down a
little<00:00:03.810> bit<00:00:04.049> more<00:00:04.290> than<00:00:04.350> a<00:00:04.500> third<00:00:05.299> seem<00:00:06.299> like

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
first one all the way well I thought you

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.940 
first one all the way well I thought you
know<00:00:36.510> some<00:00:36.750> of<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.899> some<00:00:37.350> stuff<00:00:37.559> we<00:00:37.649> worked<00:00:37.829> on

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
know some of the some stuff we worked on

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.170 
know some of the some stuff we worked on
the<00:00:38.040> last<00:00:38.219> few<00:00:38.309> days<00:00:38.430> just<00:00:38.489> and<00:00:38.850> wise<00:00:38.940> I

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
the last few days just and wise I

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.340 
the last few days just and wise I
thought<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.480> guys<00:00:39.629> are<00:00:39.780> working<00:00:39.899> trying<00:00:40.320> to

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
thought the guys are working trying to

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.500 
thought the guys are working trying to
get<00:00:40.500> that<00:00:40.649> new<00:00:40.860> place<00:00:41.120> and<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:42.239> thought<00:00:42.390> the

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
get that new place and I thought the

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.389 
get that new place and I thought the
execution<00:00:43.020> was<00:00:43.050> was<00:00:43.739> pretty<00:00:43.980> good<00:00:44.129> overall

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
execution was was pretty good overall

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.490 
execution was was pretty good overall
and<00:00:44.670> I<00:00:44.730> thought<00:00:44.910> you<00:00:45.600> know<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.079> pace<00:00:46.469> for

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
and I thought you know the the pace for

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.619 
and I thought you know the the pace for
the<00:00:46.800> most<00:00:47.010> part<00:00:47.210> stay<00:00:48.210> pretty<00:00:48.420> high

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
the most part stay pretty high

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:49.819 
the most part stay pretty high
throughout<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.140> whole<00:00:49.289> game<00:00:49.320> considering

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
throughout the whole game considering

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.229 
throughout the whole game considering
this<00:00:49.950> was<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.190> first<00:00:50.430> kind<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:50.700> scrimmage<00:00:51.059> and

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
this was the first kind of scrimmage and

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.430 
this was the first kind of scrimmage and
all<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.420> sudden<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.719> lot<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:51.930> banging<00:00:52.110> and

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
all of a sudden a lot of banging and

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.799 
all of a sudden a lot of banging and
stops<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:52.980> starts<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.550> overall<00:00:54.510> I<00:00:54.539> thought

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
stops and starts and overall I thought

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:55.910 
stops and starts and overall I thought
there<00:00:54.960> were<00:00:55.050> some<00:00:55.140> good<00:00:55.230> things<00:00:55.289> out<00:00:55.559> there<00:00:55.620> I

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
there were some good things out there I

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.279 
there were some good things out there I
guess<00:00:56.309> it's<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.750> little<00:00:57.750> bit<00:00:57.870> different<00:00:58.199> this

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
guess it's a little bit different this

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.040 
guess it's a little bit different this
year<00:00:58.350> obviously<00:00:58.760> you<00:00:59.760> know<00:00:59.879> with<00:01:00.059> all<00:01:00.239> all<00:01:00.840> the

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
year obviously you know with all all the

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.110 
year obviously you know with all all the
guys<00:01:01.199> that<00:01:01.410> we<00:01:01.530> got<00:01:01.710> down<00:01:01.920> from<00:01:02.579> Carolina

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
guys that we got down from Carolina

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.490 
guys that we got down from Carolina
there's<00:01:03.979> you<00:01:04.979> know<00:01:05.330> probably<00:01:06.330> over<00:01:06.810> 15<00:01:07.260> guys

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
there's you know probably over 15 guys

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.710 
there's you know probably over 15 guys
that<00:01:07.830> could<00:01:08.430> potentially<00:01:08.580> be<00:01:09.090> call-ups<00:01:09.510> this

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
that could potentially be call-ups this

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.289 
that could potentially be call-ups this
year<00:01:09.990> for<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:11.070> Hurricanes<00:01:11.850> if<00:01:12.060> there's<00:01:12.240> a

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
year for the Hurricanes if there's a

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.300

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
season so you want to be that guy that

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.960 
season so you want to be that guy that
stands<00:01:14.729> out<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.920> you<00:01:16.920> don't<00:01:17.100> want<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.430> be

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
inconsistent you want to do it every day

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.609 
inconsistent you want to do it every day
you<00:01:20.189> want<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.430> start<00:01:20.640> right<00:01:20.850> from<00:01:20.880> day<00:01:21.270> one<00:01:21.509> and

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
you want to start right from day one and

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:24.170 
you want to start right from day one and
it<00:01:22.619> comes<00:01:22.860> into<00:01:23.100> practice<00:01:23.549> that<00:01:23.700> comes<00:01:23.939> in<00:01:24.090> the

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
it comes into practice that comes in the

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.780 
it comes into practice that comes in the
testing<00:01:24.659> it<00:01:25.259> comes<00:01:25.500> in<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.770> game<00:01:25.950> so<00:01:26.280> it's

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
testing it comes in the game so it's

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.899 
testing it comes in the game so it's
kind<00:01:27.000> of<00:01:27.380> an<00:01:28.380> all-around<00:01:28.799> thing<00:01:29.040> yeah<00:01:29.790> it's

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
kind of an all-around thing yeah it's

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.700 
kind of an all-around thing yeah it's
hard<00:01:30.119> makes<00:01:30.570> camp<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:30.960> much<00:01:31.110> better<00:01:31.320> I<00:01:31.470> mean

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
hard makes camp that much better I mean

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.109 
hard makes camp that much better I mean
obviously<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:32.280> circumstances<00:01:32.880> are<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:33.000> lot

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
obviously the circumstances are a lot

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.330 
obviously the circumstances are a lot
different<00:01:33.150> than<00:01:33.630> in<00:01:34.500> past<00:01:34.710> years<00:01:35.040> with<00:01:35.310> the

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
different than in past years with the
