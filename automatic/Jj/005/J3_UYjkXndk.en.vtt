that<00:00:22.680> you<00:00:23.100> can<00:00:23.279> actually<00:00:23.430> resolve<00:00:24.119> if<00:00:24.449> you

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
that you can actually resolve if you

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.310 
that you can actually resolve if you

switch the sim too so I know it's very
frustrating<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:09.479> actually<00:01:10.260> switch<00:01:11.250> between

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
frustrating to actually switch between

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.830 
frustrating to actually switch between
scenes<00:01:12.000> just<00:01:12.210> like<00:01:12.450> this<00:01:12.630> but<00:01:14.330> actually<00:01:15.330> I'm

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
set up a hotkey for that one so it's

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.920 
set up a hotkey for that one so it's
very<00:01:22.110> easy<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.650> can<00:01:22.830> just<00:01:23.009> go<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.490> tools

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930

problems because i'm streaming at the

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:14.490 
problems because i'm streaming at the
moment<00:06:11.860> plus<00:06:12.130> using<00:06:12.820> Camtasia<00:06:13.300> and<00:06:13.660> I'm<00:06:14.290> not

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:14.500
