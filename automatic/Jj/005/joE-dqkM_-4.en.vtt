cool
one<00:06:38.280> is<00:06:38.460> with<00:06:39.150> this<00:06:39.300> kind<00:06:39.840> of<00:06:39.900> digital

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:40.140 
one is with this kind of digital

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:43.190 
one is with this kind of digital
technology<00:06:40.640> your<00:06:41.640> signal<00:06:42.240> is<00:06:42.360> so<00:06:42.660> preserved

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:43.200 
technology your signal is so preserved

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.650 
technology your signal is so preserved
all<00:06:43.530> of<00:06:43.710> the<00:06:43.830> tone<00:06:44.100> from<00:06:44.370> your<00:06:44.520> hands<00:06:44.970> makes<00:06:45.510> it

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:45.660 
all of the tone from your hands makes it

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:47.600 
all of the tone from your hands makes it
right<00:06:45.810> to<00:06:45.990> your<00:06:46.110> amp<00:06:46.710> as<00:06:46.950> you'd<00:06:47.130> expect<00:06:47.220> with<00:06:47.460> a

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:47.610 
right to your amp as you'd expect with a

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:49.880 
right to your amp as you'd expect with a
cable<00:06:47.910> but<00:06:48.660> in<00:06:48.750> fact<00:06:48.900> it<00:06:49.110> actually<00:06:49.140> came<00:06:49.680> out<00:06:49.830> a

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:49.890 
cable but in fact it actually came out a

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:51.710 
cable but in fact it actually came out a
little<00:06:50.070> better<00:06:50.370> than<00:06:50.670> a<00:06:50.700> cable<00:06:51.180> so<00:06:51.600> we've

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:51.720 
little better than a cable so we've

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.020 
little better than a cable so we've
added<00:06:51.870> a<00:06:52.050> cable<00:06:52.470> tone<00:06:52.710> emulations<00:06:53.400> features

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:54.030 
added a cable tone emulations features

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:55.940 
added a cable tone emulations features
so<00:06:54.270> you<00:06:54.330> can<00:06:54.600> make<00:06:55.200> it<00:06:55.350> sound<00:06:55.560> like<00:06:55.710> you're

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:55.950 
so you can make it sound like you're

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:58.940 
so you can make it sound like you're
wonderful<00:06:56.640> or<00:06:56.820> crappy<00:06:57.090> cable<00:06:57.680> just<00:06:58.680> putting

00:06:58.940 --> 00:06:58.950 
wonderful or crappy cable just putting

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:01.740 
on how far you turn the knob and like I

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:03.260 
on how far you turn the knob and like I
said<00:07:01.890> it's<00:07:02.130> really<00:07:02.400> bonehead<00:07:02.820> simple<00:07:03.150> to<00:07:03.240> use

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:03.270 
said it's really bonehead simple to use

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:06.440 
said it's really bonehead simple to use
just<00:07:03.870> jack<00:07:04.080> it<00:07:04.110> in<00:07:04.410> and<00:07:04.710> get<00:07:04.920> wired<00:07:05.310> tone<00:07:05.730> out

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:06.450 
just jack it in and get wired tone out

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:09.560 
just jack it in and get wired tone out
of<00:07:06.690> a<00:07:06.810> wireless<00:07:07.350> so<00:07:07.650> that's<00:07:07.860> from<00:07:08.010> line<00:07:08.190> 6<00:07:08.570> give
