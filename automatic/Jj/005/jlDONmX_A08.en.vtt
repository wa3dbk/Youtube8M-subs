I<00:06:44.550> can't<00:06:44.759> wait<00:06:44.939> to<00:06:44.969> use<00:06:45.270> it<00:06:45.300> I'm<00:06:45.960> not<00:06:46.199> a<00:06:46.229> person

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:46.500 
I can't wait to use it I'm not a person

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.860 
I can't wait to use it I'm not a person
that<00:06:46.680> uses<00:06:46.949> tons<00:06:47.400> of<00:06:47.550> different<00:06:47.699> colors<00:06:48.389> on<00:06:48.719> my

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:48.870

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:51.439 
that uses tons of different colors on my
eyes<00:06:49.110> at<00:06:49.469> the<00:06:49.590> same<00:06:49.800> time<00:06:50.099> I<00:06:50.490> typically<00:06:51.300> use

00:06:51.439 --> 00:06:51.449 
eyes at the same time I typically use

00:06:51.449 --> 00:06:53.809 
eyes at the same time I typically use
just<00:06:52.319> an<00:06:52.439> all-over<00:06:52.620> lid<00:06:53.069> color<00:06:53.370> up<00:06:53.610> through

00:06:53.809 --> 00:06:53.819 
just an all-over lid color up through

00:06:53.819 --> 00:06:55.850 
just an all-over lid color up through
the<00:06:53.909> crease<00:06:54.240> and<00:06:54.599> then<00:06:54.689> just<00:06:55.080> a<00:06:55.139> highlight<00:06:55.589> for

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:55.860 
the crease and then just a highlight for

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:59.329 
the crease and then just a highlight for
the<00:06:56.400> brow<00:06:56.580> bone<00:06:56.879> and<00:06:57.259> so<00:06:58.259> this<00:06:58.680> is<00:06:58.830> a<00:06:58.860> great

00:06:59.329 --> 00:06:59.339 
the brow bone and so this is a great

00:06:59.339 --> 00:07:01.519 
the brow bone and so this is a great
size<00:06:59.669> brush<00:07:00.150> for<00:07:00.509> just<00:07:00.719> applying<00:07:01.020> all<00:07:01.469> over

00:07:01.519 --> 00:07:01.529 
size brush for just applying all over

00:07:01.529 --> 00:07:04.519 
size brush for just applying all over
the<00:07:02.039> whole<00:07:02.159> entire<00:07:02.580> lid<00:07:03.169> with<00:07:04.169> the<00:07:04.289> least

00:07:04.519 --> 00:07:04.529 
the whole entire lid with the least

00:07:04.529 --> 00:07:07.040 
the whole entire lid with the least
amount<00:07:04.710> of<00:07:05.009> strokes<00:07:05.249> as<00:07:05.490> possible<00:07:05.520> there<00:07:06.180> so

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:07.050 
amount of strokes as possible there so

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:11.149 
amount of strokes as possible there so
that's<00:07:07.259> that<00:07:07.500> one<00:07:07.740> again<00:07:08.009> it's<00:07:08.189> the<00:07:08.339> e<00:07:08.370> 50<00:07:10.159> so

00:07:11.149 --> 00:07:11.159 
that's that one again it's the e 50 so

00:07:11.159 --> 00:07:13.670 
that's that one again it's the e 50 so
