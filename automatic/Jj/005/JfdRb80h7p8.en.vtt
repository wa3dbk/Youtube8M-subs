it so I walked into walmart yeah it's
then<00:03:40.840> right<00:03:41.079> on<00:03:41.319> the<00:03:41.380> shelf<00:03:41.620> I<00:03:41.829> didn't<00:03:42.130> even

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
then right on the shelf I didn't even

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.039 
then right on the shelf I didn't even
need<00:03:42.430> a<00:03:42.489> pre-order<00:03:42.940> that<00:03:43.269> was<00:03:43.389> so<00:03:43.630> dumb<00:03:43.840> I'm

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
need a pre-order that was so dumb I'm

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:46.259 
need a pre-order that was so dumb I'm
not<00:03:44.230> gonna<00:03:44.350> do<00:03:44.530> that<00:03:44.560> again<00:03:45.030> anyways<00:03:46.030> I<00:03:46.239> think

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
not gonna do that again anyways I think

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:48.059 
not gonna do that again anyways I think
that's<00:03:46.569> why<00:03:46.840> I<00:03:46.870> kind<00:03:47.200> of<00:03:47.230> like<00:03:47.380> didn't<00:03:47.709> start

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:48.069 
that's why I kind of like didn't start

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:49.710 
that's why I kind of like didn't start
it<00:03:48.220> because<00:03:48.400> once<00:03:48.579> I<00:03:48.670> did<00:03:48.940> get<00:03:49.090> it<00:03:49.239> it<00:03:49.420> was<00:03:49.540> just

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
it because once I did get it it was just

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.990 
it because once I did get it it was just
like<00:03:49.870> bad<00:03:50.500> timing<00:03:50.920> like<00:03:51.220> I<00:03:51.310> worked<00:03:51.549> a<00:03:51.639> 12-hour

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
like bad timing like I worked a 12-hour

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.210 
like bad timing like I worked a 12-hour
shift<00:03:52.359> the<00:03:52.989> next<00:03:53.019> day<00:03:53.410> and<00:03:53.620> I<00:03:53.739> didn't<00:03:54.100> have

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
shift the next day and I didn't have

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:55.740 
shift the next day and I didn't have
time<00:03:54.400> to<00:03:54.549> read<00:03:54.730> and<00:03:54.940> then<00:03:55.030> I<00:03:55.120> was<00:03:55.269> tired<00:03:55.510> and

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750
