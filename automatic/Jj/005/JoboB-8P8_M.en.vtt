 we are going to make it very simple and this is 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.049

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:22.740
 making the sauce let's add the 

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:25.229
 chiles that previously hydrated make 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.930
 a lot of bible I recommend you do more than 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.750
 500 grams of meat because he does not know what 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.390
 rich that remains the next day between 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.720
 more days go by, the more good the 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.360
 birria truth today the lime reheated 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.700
 when we did live at home I would 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.280
 agreement that we almost ate almost in the 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.990
 Come and have breakfast, live how rich 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.409
 was then the most start liquefying a 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.409
 bit 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:56.910
 let's add spices that are very 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:00.780
 important cilantro seeds we are going to 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:03.030
 put with 1 this is the taste of 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.820
 bible that knows how to smoke well 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:09.600
 seasoned oregano you can put 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.130
 also dry ginger and cinnamon is another 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.680
 the ingredients that can also 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:17.010
 bring the bible and it's going excellent and you 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:20.210
 let's put onion then we liquefy 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.210
 very very good 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.830
 also to use 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.470
 in little houses a minute or two to 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.989
 finish liquefying and see the color of 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.190
 this wonderful sauce then the 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.890
 we put in a saucepan 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:06.820
 and he knows that another advice that I give him if 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:10.090
 you have time you can leave about two 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:12.430
 or three hours marinating the raw meat 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.920
 in the sauce so the meat will absorb 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.170
 all the taste of fact from a day 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.840
 earlier you can put the meat in 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:22.300
 this salsita and it is going to be softened 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.240
 is going to be macerating and at the time of 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.730
 cook good 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:29.370
 how wonderful the sauce is 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.650
 so here how much time are we going to 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.110
 cooking let's bring it to a boil 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.470
 important that it releases the boil because 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:39.350
 boil we are going to cover 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:41.810
 we cover our bible and we download it to 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.720
 medium fire and let's count 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:47.630
 two hours in two hours the meat should 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.790
 be super soft all the flavor of 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.830
 the bible and you saw how easy it is 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.110
 do it in the kitchen we do not have to 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.120

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.710
