took off the parts that I wanted painted
and<00:00:33.739> basically<00:00:34.739> just<00:00:34.950> used<00:00:35.250> plastic<00:00:36.290> krylon

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
and basically just used plastic krylon

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.709 
and basically just used plastic krylon
paint<00:00:37.590> I<00:00:37.829> just<00:00:38.489> prepped<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.879> plastic<00:00:39.329> up<00:00:39.510> real

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
paint I just prepped the plastic up real

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.810 
paint I just prepped the plastic up real
good<00:00:39.750> make<00:00:40.140> sure<00:00:40.170> any<00:00:40.829> any<00:00:41.190> grease<00:00:41.489> or<00:00:41.670> any

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
good make sure any any grease or any

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.790 
good make sure any any grease or any
oils<00:00:42.149> that<00:00:42.270> are<00:00:42.329> around<00:00:42.510> there<00:00:42.750> did<00:00:43.440> probably

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
oils that are around there did probably

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.010 
oils that are around there did probably
around<00:00:44.309> four<00:00:44.610> or<00:00:44.730> five<00:00:44.910> coats<00:00:45.239> on<00:00:45.480> each<00:00:45.690> piece

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
around four or five coats on each piece

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.490 
around four or five coats on each piece
so<00:00:46.379> it's<00:00:46.980> pretty<00:00:47.520> durable<00:00:47.840> scratch<00:00:48.840> resistant

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
so it's pretty durable scratch resistant

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.500 
so it's pretty durable scratch resistant
to<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.620> degree<00:00:49.860> but<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.640> parts<00:00:50.910> that<00:00:51.059> I<00:00:51.149> want<00:00:51.180> to

to a degree but the parts that I want to

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.170 
to a degree but the parts that I want to
putting<00:00:51.719> it<00:00:51.870> on<00:00:52.100> really<00:00:53.100> don't<00:00:53.370> get<00:00:53.520> any<00:00:53.579> abuse

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
were pretty short and I found that the

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.880 
were pretty short and I found that the
my<00:02:47.030> little<00:02:47.210> thumb<00:02:47.540> screws<00:02:47.930> kept<00:02:48.140> on<00:02:48.320> turning

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
my little thumb screws kept on turning

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.220 
my little thumb screws kept on turning
out<00:02:49.280> and<00:02:49.580> falling<00:02:49.940> off<00:02:50.240> during<00:02:50.510> a<00:02:50.690> race<00:02:50.930> or

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
out and falling off during a race or

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.980 
out and falling off during a race or
just<00:02:51.560> even<00:02:51.710> just<00:02:52.040> around<00:02:52.340> the<00:02:52.490> house<00:02:52.810> so<00:02:53.810> what

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
just even just around the house so what

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.260 
just even just around the house so what
I<00:02:54.050> wound<00:02:54.380> up<00:02:54.500> doing<00:02:54.560> is<00:02:55.460> because<00:02:55.880> I<00:02:55.910> have<00:02:56.240> a

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
I wound up doing is because I have a

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.420 
I wound up doing is because I have a
thicker<00:02:56.600> battery<00:02:57.110> that<00:02:57.350> I<00:02:57.380> use<00:02:57.680> in<00:02:57.920> this<00:02:58.130> I'm

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430

using the the 8000 and so I had to make

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.440 
using the the 8000 and so I had to make
a<00:03:02.960> special<00:03:03.650> bracket<00:03:04.340> for<00:03:04.580> it<00:03:04.700> for<00:03:05.030> it<00:03:05.090> to<00:03:05.240> fit

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
a special bracket for it for it to fit

bulkhead<00:05:15.870> I<00:05:16.020> got<00:05:16.350> but<00:05:17.310> you<00:05:17.460> notice<00:05:17.760> on<00:05:18.740> when

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
bulkhead I got but you notice on when

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.430 
bulkhead I got but you notice on when
you<00:05:19.830> use<00:05:19.890> the<00:05:20.100> RPM<00:05:20.550> arms<00:05:20.880> you<00:05:21.060> don't<00:05:21.540> need<00:05:22.110> that

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
you use the RPM arms you don't need that

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.980 
you use the RPM arms you don't need that
brace<00:05:22.830> that<00:05:23.070> sits<00:05:23.400> right<00:05:23.490> in<00:05:23.790> front<00:05:24.120> so<00:05:24.780> they

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
brace that sits right in front so they

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:26.990 
brace that sits right in front so they
have<00:05:25.200> alleviated<00:05:25.680> that<00:05:26.130> so<00:05:26.430> I<00:05:26.460> bought<00:05:26.760> that

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
have alleviated that so I bought that

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.390 
have alleviated that so I bought that
part<00:05:27.570> that<00:05:27.750> was<00:05:27.930> to<00:05:28.080> go<00:05:28.200> there<00:05:28.470> but<00:05:28.710> after<00:05:28.980> I

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
part that was to go there but after I

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.210

got<00:05:29.880> my<00:05:30.060> rpm<00:05:30.510> arms<00:05:30.810> I<00:05:30.960> no<00:05:31.260> longer<00:05:31.590> needed<00:05:31.950> it

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:32.220 
got my rpm arms I no longer needed it

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.210 
got my rpm arms I no longer needed it
and<00:05:32.600> the<00:05:33.600> rear<00:05:33.870> you<00:05:34.260> can<00:05:34.320> see<00:05:34.470> that<00:05:34.650> I<00:05:34.950> did<00:05:35.130> the

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.220 
and the rear you can see that I did the

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.710 
and the rear you can see that I did the
same<00:05:35.250> thing<00:05:35.460> in<00:05:35.820> the<00:05:35.910> rear<00:05:36.210> and<00:05:38.600> everything<00:05:39.600> is

same thing in the rear and everything is
perfect<00:05:40.260> I<00:05:40.500> did<00:05:41.100> make<00:05:41.310> a<00:05:41.340> front<00:05:42.060> skid<00:05:42.420> plate

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750 
perfect I did make a front skid plate

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:46.700 
perfect I did make a front skid plate
for<00:05:43.140> it<00:05:44.600> flip<00:05:45.600> this<00:05:45.750> around<00:05:45.810> get<00:05:46.410> underneath

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
for it flip this around get underneath

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:51.260 
for it flip this around get underneath
and<00:05:47.900> basically<00:05:48.900> all<00:05:49.080> I<00:05:49.110> did<00:05:49.790> was<00:05:50.790> just<00:05:50.970> cut<00:05:51.150> out

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.270 
and basically all I did was just cut out

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.080 
and basically all I did was just cut out
a<00:05:51.330> piece<00:05:51.540> of<00:05:51.690> plastic<00:05:52.110> in<00:05:52.260> the<00:05:52.410> form<00:05:52.710> of<00:05:53.090> the

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:54.090 
a piece of plastic in the form of the

a piece of plastic in the form of the
front<00:05:54.360> bumper<00:05:54.570> and<00:05:55.820> just<00:05:56.820> screwed<00:05:57.450> that<00:05:57.570> on

that and let's see if flip this over so
you<00:06:04.020> can<00:06:04.110> see<00:06:04.320> a<00:06:04.350> little<00:06:04.590> better

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:07.370 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:13.300 

you<00:06:07.580> know<00:06:08.500> stiffens<00:06:09.500> it<00:06:09.650> up<00:06:09.800> a<00:06:09.919> bit<00:06:12.100> really<00:06:13.100> not

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:13.310 
you know stiffens it up a bit really not

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:15.159 
you know stiffens it up a bit really not
much<00:06:13.490> other<00:06:13.970> than<00:06:14.150> that<00:06:14.510> there's<00:06:14.780> really<00:06:14.960> not

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:15.169

I don't know how well you can see the

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:44.860 
I don't know how well you can see the
holes<00:07:42.860> but<00:07:43.520> I<00:07:43.610> did<00:07:43.820> put<00:07:44.030> some<00:07:44.060> holes<00:07:44.449> in<00:07:44.750> it

just<00:07:45.080> for<00:07:45.199> some<00:07:45.349> ventilation<00:07:46.130> purposes<00:07:46.370> if

00:07:46.839 --> 00:07:46.849 
just for some ventilation purposes if

00:07:46.849 --> 00:07:49.770 
just for some ventilation purposes if
somebody<00:07:47.180> at<00:07:47.270> the<00:07:47.389> track<00:07:47.660> did<00:07:47.900> the<00:07:48.020> same<00:07:48.229> thing

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:49.780 
somebody at the track did the same thing

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:52.860 
somebody at the track did the same thing
at<00:07:50.780> the<00:07:51.020> time<00:07:51.229> I<00:07:51.530> thought<00:07:51.800> it<00:07:51.860> was<00:07:51.979> a<00:07:52.099> good<00:07:52.340> idea

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:52.870 
at the time I thought it was a good idea

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:56.830 
at the time I thought it was a good idea
but<00:07:53.889> it<00:07:54.889> seems<00:07:55.250> to<00:07:55.430> be<00:07:55.460> okay<00:07:55.970> I<00:07:56.150> mean<00:07:56.510> if<00:07:56.660> you

00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:56.840 
but it seems to be okay I mean if you

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:58.450 
but it seems to be okay I mean if you
want<00:07:57.020> to<00:07:57.080> do<00:07:57.229> it<00:07:57.380> you<00:07:57.500> can<00:07:57.650> do<00:07:57.770> it<00:07:57.919> I<00:07:58.099> don't

00:07:58.450 --> 00:07:58.460 
want to do it you can do it I don't

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:02.460 
want to do it you can do it I don't
think<00:07:58.669> it<00:07:58.910> makes<00:07:59.060> that<00:07:59.300> much<00:07:59.510> of<00:07:59.690> a<00:07:59.780> difference

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:02.470 

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:05.830 

that<00:08:03.470> is<00:08:03.680> pretty<00:08:04.039> much<00:08:04.250> about<00:08:04.610> it<00:08:04.669> well<00:08:05.360> I<00:08:05.539> hope

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:05.840 
that is pretty much about it well I hope

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:07.960 
that is pretty much about it well I hope
