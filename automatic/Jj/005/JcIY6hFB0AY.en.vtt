00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
you've got your new set up so from an

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.650 
you've got your new set up so from an
overall<00:01:31.830> this<00:01:32.490> is<00:01:32.550> a<00:01:33.090> pretty<00:01:33.390> standard

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:33.660 
overall this is a pretty standard

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.719 
overall this is a pretty standard
headlamp<00:01:34.229> I<00:01:34.380> think<00:01:34.619> of<00:01:34.740> what<00:01:35.190> you're<00:01:35.369> used<00:01:35.580> to

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
headlamp I think of what you're used to

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.029 
headlamp I think of what you're used to
in<00:01:35.910> this<00:01:36.030> sort<00:01:36.240> of<00:01:36.300> mid-range<00:01:36.630> mid<00:01:37.349> brightness

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:38.039 
in this sort of mid-range mid brightness

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:41.300 
in this sort of mid-range mid brightness
about<00:01:38.759> 68<00:01:39.420> lumens<00:01:39.959> is<00:01:40.140> where<00:01:40.440> this<00:01:40.649> clocks<00:01:41.009> in

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
about 68 lumens is where this clocks in

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.609 
about 68 lumens is where this clocks in
at<00:01:41.459> and<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:42.119> is<00:01:42.240> quite<00:01:42.539> bright<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.110> that<00:01:43.500> was

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
at and it is quite bright and that was

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.199 
at and it is quite bright and that was
one<00:01:43.770> of<00:01:43.800> the<00:01:43.979> things<00:01:44.130> that<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.369> noticed<00:01:44.819> right

00:01:45.199 --> 00:01:45.209 
one of the things that I noticed right

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:47.330 
one of the things that I noticed right
out<00:01:45.360> of<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.569> gate<00:01:45.780> was<00:01:46.020> for<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.530> light<00:01:46.770> for<00:01:47.250> as

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
out of the gate was for the light for as

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.279 
out of the gate was for the light for as
lightweight<00:01:47.610> as<00:01:47.940> this<00:01:48.240> is<00:01:48.479> this<00:01:48.959> front

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:49.289 
lightweight as this is this front

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:51.050 
lightweight as this is this front
assembly<00:01:49.560> is<00:01:49.860> really<00:01:50.160> lightweight<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.880> then

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
assembly is really lightweight and then

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.630 
assembly is really lightweight and then
they<00:01:51.179> use<00:01:51.420> lithium<00:01:52.140> polymer<00:01:52.429> batteries<00:01:53.429> here

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
they use lithium polymer batteries here

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.339 
they use lithium polymer batteries here
in<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.819> back<00:01:54.000> so<00:01:54.450> this<00:01:54.630> whole<00:01:54.840> thing<00:01:54.869> has<00:01:55.319> a

00:01:55.339 --> 00:01:55.349 
in the back so this whole thing has a

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:59.029 
in the back so this whole thing has a
really<00:01:55.770> nice<00:01:56.039> lightweight<00:01:56.759> feel<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.660> it<00:01:58.039> your

00:01:59.029 --> 00:01:59.039 
really nice lightweight feel to it your

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:01.130 
really nice lightweight feel to it your
headlamp<00:01:59.429> itself<00:01:59.849> so<00:02:00.360> let's<00:02:00.539> turn<00:02:00.750> that<00:02:00.929> on

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
headlamp itself so let's turn that on

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.930 
headlamp itself so let's turn that on
you<00:02:01.440> can<00:02:01.470> see<00:02:01.739> you<00:02:01.860> get<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.009> nice<00:02:02.280> bright<00:02:02.640> beam

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
you can see you get a nice bright beam

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.270 
you can see you get a nice bright beam
it's<00:02:03.450> an<00:02:03.569> oval<00:02:03.929> versus<00:02:04.410> just<00:02:04.649> around<00:02:04.950> so<00:02:05.190> you

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
it's an oval versus just around so you

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.520 
it's an oval versus just around so you
do<00:02:05.399> get<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.580> little<00:02:05.729> wider<00:02:06.149> aspect<00:02:06.899> you<00:02:07.289> can't

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
do get a little wider aspect you can't

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.139 
do get a little wider aspect you can't
change<00:02:07.800> that<00:02:08.130> there's<00:02:08.399> not<00:02:08.520> a<00:02:08.580> diffuser<00:02:09.030> or

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
change that there's not a diffuser or

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.110 
change that there's not a diffuser or
anything<00:02:09.450> and<00:02:10.550> one<00:02:11.550> of<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.760> things<00:02:11.970> that

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
anything and one of the things that

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.360 
anything and one of the things that
you'll<00:02:12.239> note<00:02:12.510> is<00:02:12.720> that<00:02:13.050> when<00:02:13.830> you<00:02:13.920> turn<00:02:14.069> it<00:02:14.220> on

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
you'll note is that when you turn it on

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.020 
you'll note is that when you turn it on
you<00:02:14.790> have<00:02:14.819> a<00:02:15.209> flood<00:02:15.540> or<00:02:15.810> in<00:02:16.319> a<00:02:16.410> flash<00:02:16.790> light<00:02:17.790> and

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
you have a flood or in a flash light and

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.820 
you have a flood or in a flash light and
that's<00:02:18.270> kind<00:02:18.510> of<00:02:18.569> it<00:02:18.780> so<00:02:19.170> what<00:02:19.319> you<00:02:19.410> have<00:02:19.530> to<00:02:19.680> do

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
that's kind of it so what you have to do

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.679 
that's kind of it so what you have to do
is<00:02:20.010> actually<00:02:20.160> hold<00:02:20.489> this<00:02:20.640> button<00:02:20.849> down<00:02:21.030> and

00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:21.689 
is actually hold this button down and

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:23.479 
is actually hold this button down and
that's<00:02:21.900> actually<00:02:22.260> going<00:02:22.439> to<00:02:22.590> dim<00:02:23.310> your

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
that's actually going to dim your

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.980 
that's actually going to dim your
brightness<00:02:24.030> and<00:02:24.239> then<00:02:24.390> you<00:02:24.930> can<00:02:25.079> also<00:02:25.200> go<00:02:25.530> into

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
brightness and then you can also go into

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:32.370 
brightness and then you can also go into
a<00:02:26.050> low<00:02:27.090> setting<00:02:28.780> flash<00:02:29.500> also<00:02:30.300> on<00:02:31.300> the<00:02:31.570> back<00:02:31.810> you

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
a low setting flash also on the back you

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.920 
a low setting flash also on the back you
have<00:02:32.410> a<00:02:32.950> flashing<00:02:33.550> safety<00:02:34.210> light<00:02:34.420> so<00:02:34.810> I've

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
have a flashing safety light so I've

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.440 
have a flashing safety light so I've
reviewed<00:02:35.260> another<00:02:35.590> light<00:02:36.220> before<00:02:36.730> that<00:02:37.270> had

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
reviewed another light before that had

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:38.970 
reviewed another light before that had
one<00:02:37.630> of<00:02:37.720> these<00:02:37.810> on<00:02:38.020> the<00:02:38.050> back<00:02:38.290> and<00:02:38.530> and<00:02:38.710> one<00:02:38.890> of

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
one of these on the back and and one of

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.860 
one of these on the back and and one of
my<00:02:39.070> ding<00:02:39.370> zon<00:02:39.670> it<00:02:39.790> was<00:02:39.970> that<00:02:40.180> you<00:02:40.600> couldn't

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
my ding zon it was that you couldn't

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.450 
my ding zon it was that you couldn't
turn<00:02:41.110> it<00:02:41.290> off<00:02:41.470> and<00:02:41.920> that's<00:02:42.130> not<00:02:42.250> always

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:42.460 
turn it off and that's not always

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:43.800 
turn it off and that's not always
something<00:02:42.850> that<00:02:42.880> you<00:02:43.000> want<00:02:43.210> to<00:02:43.300> have<00:02:43.420> on<00:02:43.630> if

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
something that you want to have on if

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.780 
something that you want to have on if
you're<00:02:43.930> in<00:02:44.020> a<00:02:44.050> race<00:02:44.350> you're<00:02:45.340> probably<00:02:45.610> not

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
you're in a race you're probably not

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.130 
you're in a race you're probably not
going<00:02:45.940> to<00:02:46.000> be<00:02:46.150> as<00:02:46.240> apt<00:02:46.420> to<00:02:46.570> use<00:02:46.720> that<00:02:46.900> but<00:02:47.050> if

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
going to be as apt to use that but if

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.030 
going to be as apt to use that but if
you're<00:02:47.260> running<00:02:47.350> on<00:02:47.530> the<00:02:47.650> road<00:02:47.860> at<00:02:48.010> night

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
you're running on the road at night

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.430 
you're running on the road at night
which<00:02:48.460> I<00:02:48.610> think<00:02:48.820> this<00:02:48.910> headlamp<00:02:49.300> is<00:02:49.450> really

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
which I think this headlamp is really

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.010 
which I think this headlamp is really
well<00:02:50.590> suited<00:02:50.980> for<00:02:51.010> this<00:02:51.790> is<00:02:52.060> something<00:02:52.870> that's

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
well suited for this is something that's

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.720 
well suited for this is something that's
nice<00:02:53.170> to<00:02:53.380> have<00:02:53.530> but<00:02:53.920> you<00:02:54.040> do<00:02:54.130> have<00:02:54.340> a<00:02:54.370> button

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
nice to have but you do have a button

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.450 
nice to have but you do have a button
that<00:02:54.880> you<00:02:55.120> can<00:02:55.240> just<00:02:55.390> turn<00:02:55.600> that<00:02:55.630> off<00:02:56.280> so<00:02:57.280> from

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:57.460 
that you can just turn that off so from

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.570 
that you can just turn that off so from
a<00:02:57.520> performance<00:02:57.940> standpoint<00:02:58.750> I<00:02:59.340> charge<00:03:00.340> this

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
a performance standpoint I charge this

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.390 
a performance standpoint I charge this
thing<00:03:00.880> up<00:03:01.090> and<00:03:01.240> and<00:03:01.810> discharge<00:03:02.410> it<00:03:02.620> about<00:03:03.100> four

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
thing up and and discharge it about four

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.340 
thing up and and discharge it about four
times<00:03:03.430> just<00:03:04.330> to<00:03:04.420> really<00:03:04.660> make<00:03:04.750> sure<00:03:05.110> that<00:03:05.290> I

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
times just to really make sure that I

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.590 
times just to really make sure that I
got<00:03:05.560> that<00:03:05.740> initial<00:03:06.220> juice<00:03:06.880> out<00:03:07.150> of<00:03:07.300> it

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
got that initial juice out of it

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.510 
got that initial juice out of it
charged<00:03:08.230> it<00:03:08.380> up<00:03:08.500> all<00:03:08.650> the<00:03:08.680> way<00:03:08.830> burnt<00:03:09.400> the

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
charged it up all the way burnt the

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.920 
charged it up all the way burnt the
light<00:03:09.670> all<00:03:09.850> the<00:03:09.970> way<00:03:10.000> down<00:03:10.270> and<00:03:10.420> repeated<00:03:10.810> that

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
light all the way down and repeated that

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.080 
light all the way down and repeated that
a<00:03:10.990> couple<00:03:11.260> of<00:03:11.440> times<00:03:11.680> before<00:03:12.370> I<00:03:12.550> really<00:03:12.880> kind

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
a couple of times before I really kind

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.970 
a couple of times before I really kind
of<00:03:13.150> weighed<00:03:13.360> in<00:03:13.600> and<00:03:14.080> what<00:03:14.230> I<00:03:14.260> found<00:03:14.560> was<00:03:14.950> that

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
of weighed in and what I found was that

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.700 
of weighed in and what I found was that
a<00:03:15.370> it<00:03:15.730> took<00:03:15.970> anywhere<00:03:16.480> from<00:03:16.690> about<00:03:16.840> four<00:03:17.530> to

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:17.710 
a it took anywhere from about four to

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:19.980 
a it took anywhere from about four to
five<00:03:17.950> hours<00:03:18.370> to<00:03:18.550> charge<00:03:18.790> up<00:03:19.030> the<00:03:19.150> headlamp<00:03:19.570> so

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:19.990 
five hours to charge up the headlamp so

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:21.600 
five hours to charge up the headlamp so
I<00:03:20.020> wasn't<00:03:20.200> able<00:03:20.380> to<00:03:20.560> monitor<00:03:21.160> every<00:03:21.580> single

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
I wasn't able to monitor every single

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.460 
I wasn't able to monitor every single
second<00:03:22.270> but<00:03:22.390> that<00:03:22.540> was<00:03:22.690> about<00:03:22.960> the<00:03:23.170> amount<00:03:23.410> of

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
second but that was about the amount of

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:24.720 
second but that was about the amount of
time<00:03:23.680> so<00:03:23.950> that's<00:03:24.070> something<00:03:24.310> that<00:03:24.460> you'll

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
time so that's something that you'll

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.610 
time so that's something that you'll
want<00:03:24.940> to<00:03:25.000> keep<00:03:25.510> in<00:03:25.660> mind<00:03:25.690> when<00:03:26.200> the<00:03:26.320> battery

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
want to keep in mind when the battery

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.310 
want to keep in mind when the battery
goes<00:03:26.860> down<00:03:27.190> it's<00:03:27.730> gonna<00:03:27.850> take<00:03:28.180> you<00:03:28.330> from<00:03:28.570> zero

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
goes down it's gonna take you from zero

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.260 
goes down it's gonna take you from zero
all<00:03:29.680> the<00:03:29.710> way<00:03:29.860> discharge<00:03:30.460> you're<00:03:30.850> looking<00:03:31.180> at

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:31.270 
all the way discharge you're looking at

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:33.480 
all the way discharge you're looking at
about<00:03:31.450> four<00:03:31.780> four<00:03:32.620> or<00:03:32.770> five<00:03:32.920> hours<00:03:33.220> to<00:03:33.370> get

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:33.490 
about four four or five hours to get

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:36.240 
about four four or five hours to get
that<00:03:33.670> back<00:03:34.260> from<00:03:35.260> a<00:03:35.410> performance<00:03:35.920> standpoint

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
that back from a performance standpoint

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.510 
that back from a performance standpoint
I<00:03:36.670> was<00:03:36.940> able<00:03:37.150> to<00:03:37.180> run<00:03:37.390> it<00:03:37.510> on<00:03:37.660> high<00:03:38.110> without<00:03:38.950> the

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:39.520 
I was able to run it on high without the

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.480 
I was able to run it on high without the
safety<00:03:39.880> light<00:03:40.090> on<00:03:40.270> in<00:03:40.420> the<00:03:40.450> back<00:03:40.720> for<00:03:41.500> roughly

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:42.490 
safety light on in the back for roughly

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:45.440 
safety light on in the back for roughly
eight<00:03:42.790> hours<00:03:43.300> before<00:03:43.930> I<00:03:43.960> saw<00:03:44.290> a<00:03:44.590> noticeable

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
eight hours before I saw a noticeable

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.630 
eight hours before I saw a noticeable
decrease<00:03:46.620> decrease<00:03:47.620> and<00:03:48.310> the<00:03:48.370> amount<00:03:48.580> of

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
decrease decrease and the amount of

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.160 
decrease decrease and the amount of
output<00:03:48.880> that<00:03:49.240> the<00:03:49.360> light<00:03:49.540> was<00:03:49.720> putting<00:03:50.050> out

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
output that the light was putting out

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.740 
output that the light was putting out
basically<00:03:50.920> going<00:03:51.100> from<00:03:51.490> a<00:03:51.820> high<00:03:52.240> beam<00:03:52.540> that

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
basically going from a high beam that

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.510 
basically going from a high beam that
you<00:03:52.870> saw<00:03:53.080> at<00:03:53.230> the<00:03:53.290> beginning<00:03:53.410> to<00:03:54.100> that<00:03:54.250> lower

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:54.520 
you saw at the beginning to that lower

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.610 
you saw at the beginning to that lower
beam<00:03:54.820> was<00:03:55.240> about<00:03:55.540> that<00:03:55.720> difference<00:03:56.200> pretty

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
beam was about that difference pretty

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.140 
beam was about that difference pretty
unscientific<00:03:57.340> how<00:03:57.460> I<00:03:57.490> did<00:03:57.730> it<00:03:57.820> but<00:03:58.000> basically

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
unscientific how I did it but basically

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.330 
unscientific how I did it but basically
I<00:03:58.690> had<00:03:59.020> it<00:03:59.140> in<00:03:59.200> the<00:03:59.290> dark<00:03:59.500> room<00:03:59.770> I<00:03:59.980> sort<00:04:00.280> of

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
I had it in the dark room I sort of

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.340 
I had it in the dark room I sort of
looked<00:04:00.670> at<00:04:00.820> it<00:04:00.850> shined<00:04:01.330> at<00:04:01.450> my<00:04:01.600> eyes<00:04:01.750> it<00:04:02.290> was

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
looked at it shined at my eyes it was

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.530 
looked at it shined at my eyes it was
really<00:04:02.620> bright<00:04:02.800> at<00:04:02.980> first<00:04:03.190> 68<00:04:03.670> lumens<00:04:04.090> is<00:04:04.210> a

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
really bright at first 68 lumens is a

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.990 
really bright at first 68 lumens is a
nice<00:04:04.870> amount<00:04:05.230> of<00:04:05.320> light<00:04:06.220> that<00:04:06.430> this<00:04:06.580> puts<00:04:06.820> out

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
nice amount of light that this puts out

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.970 
nice amount of light that this puts out
but<00:04:07.600> about<00:04:07.840> it<00:04:07.960> that<00:04:08.110> seven<00:04:08.470> and<00:04:08.530> a<00:04:08.650> half<00:04:08.680> to

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
but about it that seven and a half to

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.710 
but about it that seven and a half to
eight<00:04:09.160> hour<00:04:09.340> mark<00:04:09.670> I<00:04:09.880> could<00:04:10.240> really<00:04:10.420> start

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
eight hour mark I could really start

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.110 
eight hour mark I could really start
noticing<00:04:11.080> that<00:04:11.740> light<00:04:12.010> come<00:04:12.400> down<00:04:12.610> just<00:04:12.970> by

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
noticing that light come down just by

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.070 
noticing that light come down just by
simply<00:04:13.540> looking<00:04:13.990> at<00:04:14.260> the<00:04:14.350> light<00:04:14.530> itself<00:04:16.080> it

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:17.080 
simply looking at the light itself it

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.039 
simply looking at the light itself it
does<00:04:17.380> have<00:04:17.620> a<00:04:17.890> strap<00:04:18.760> that<00:04:19.239> goes<00:04:19.299> on<00:04:19.690> to<00:04:20.020> the

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
does have a strap that goes on to the

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:21.960 
does have a strap that goes on to the
top<00:04:20.170> I<00:04:20.560> mentioned<00:04:21.010> it's<00:04:21.160> lightweight<00:04:21.400> which

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
top I mentioned it's lightweight which

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.670 
top I mentioned it's lightweight which
is<00:04:22.180> really<00:04:22.450> important<00:04:22.930> because<00:04:23.020> I<00:04:23.230> do<00:04:23.290> think

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
is really important because I do think

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.740 
is really important because I do think
that's<00:04:23.770> one<00:04:24.010> of<00:04:24.040> the<00:04:24.160> the<00:04:24.730> major<00:04:25.030> high<00:04:25.330> points

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
that's one of the the major high points

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.810 
that's one of the the major high points
of<00:04:25.870> this<00:04:25.990> is<00:04:26.230> is<00:04:26.410> how<00:04:26.590> lightweight<00:04:26.860> it<00:04:27.100> is<00:04:27.340> but

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
of this is is how lightweight it is but

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.520 
of this is is how lightweight it is but
if<00:04:27.910> you<00:04:28.000> do<00:04:28.120> want<00:04:28.330> some<00:04:28.450> extra<00:04:28.570> stability<00:04:28.870> you

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
if you do want some extra stability you

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.710 
if you do want some extra stability you
can<00:04:29.680> just<00:04:29.890> simply<00:04:30.040> run<00:04:30.640> this<00:04:30.850> and<00:04:31.090> hook<00:04:31.480> it<00:04:31.630> on

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
can just simply run this and hook it on

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.690 
can just simply run this and hook it on
the<00:04:31.810> top<00:04:32.020> to<00:04:32.410> have<00:04:32.530> a<00:04:32.560> little<00:04:32.830> bit<00:04:32.950> more<00:04:33.100> going

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:33.700 
the top to have a little bit more going

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.570 
the top to have a little bit more going
over<00:04:33.880> the<00:04:34.000> top<00:04:34.479> of<00:04:34.690> your<00:04:34.810> head

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
over the top of your head

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.939 
over the top of your head
a<00:04:36.639> couple<00:04:37.300> other<00:04:37.389> things<00:04:37.479> of<00:04:37.840> note<00:04:38.050> were<00:04:38.439> the

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:38.949 
a couple other things of note were the

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:40.920 
a couple other things of note were the
court<00:04:39.250> is<00:04:39.460> very<00:04:39.520> well<00:04:39.970> hidden<00:04:40.360> so<00:04:40.629> I

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
court is very well hidden so I

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.929 
court is very well hidden so I
personally<00:04:41.770> wear<00:04:42.009> a<00:04:42.250> headlamp

00:04:42.929 --> 00:04:42.939 
personally wear a headlamp

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:45.990 
personally wear a headlamp
like<00:04:43.479> this<00:04:43.870> for<00:04:44.409> races<00:04:44.800> but<00:04:44.979> that<00:04:45.250> try<00:04:45.819> of

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
like this for races but that try of

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.760 
like this for races but that try of
triple-a<00:04:46.389> batteries<00:04:46.870> in<00:04:46.960> the<00:04:47.050> back<00:04:47.229> and<00:04:47.650> of

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
triple-a batteries in the back and of

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.469 
triple-a batteries in the back and of
course<00:04:47.949> a<00:04:48.009> light<00:04:48.189> assembly<00:04:48.669> on<00:04:48.819> the<00:04:49.000> front<00:04:49.300> and

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:49.479 
course a light assembly on the front and

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:51.659 
course a light assembly on the front and
that<00:04:49.810> cord<00:04:50.080> runs<00:04:50.349> across<00:04:50.590> the<00:04:50.889> side<00:04:51.159> here<00:04:51.490> on

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:51.669 
that cord runs across the side here on

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:53.700 
that cord runs across the side here on
the<00:04:51.789> outside<00:04:52.210> and<00:04:52.539> has<00:04:52.810> a<00:04:52.840> coil<00:04:53.199> on<00:04:53.409> the<00:04:53.439> side

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
the outside and has a coil on the side

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.469 
the outside and has a coil on the side
of<00:04:53.740> it<00:04:54.009> they<00:04:54.400> did<00:04:54.550> kind<00:04:54.699> of<00:04:54.789> a<00:04:54.879> nice<00:04:55.060> thing<00:04:55.090> and

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:55.479 
of it they did kind of a nice thing and

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:59.010 
of it they did kind of a nice thing and
actually<00:04:55.990> built<00:04:56.710> another<00:04:56.979> piece<00:04:57.340> on<00:04:58.330> top<00:04:58.810> of

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
actually built another piece on top of

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.749 
actually built another piece on top of
the<00:04:59.139> head<00:04:59.349> the<00:04:59.919> headband<00:05:00.340> here

00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:00.759 
the head the headband here

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:03.089 
the head the headband here
to<00:05:01.000> actually<00:05:01.090> hide<00:05:01.569> or<00:05:01.900> thread<00:05:02.590> that<00:05:02.740> cord

00:05:03.089 --> 00:05:03.099 
to actually hide or thread that cord

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:04.499 
to actually hide or thread that cord
through<00:05:03.280> so<00:05:03.460> it<00:05:03.550> keeps<00:05:03.669> it<00:05:03.819> a<00:05:03.909> little<00:05:04.090> safer

00:05:04.499 --> 00:05:04.509 
through so it keeps it a little safer

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:05.939 
through so it keeps it a little safer
keep<00:05:04.960> you<00:05:05.050> from<00:05:05.169> getting<00:05:05.409> snagged<00:05:05.650> in<00:05:05.830> your

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:05.949 
keep you from getting snagged in your

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:07.559 
keep you from getting snagged in your
bag<00:05:06.129> or<00:05:06.340> something<00:05:06.639> like<00:05:06.759> that<00:05:06.819> so<00:05:07.330> a<00:05:07.360> nice

00:05:07.559 --> 00:05:07.569 
bag or something like that so a nice

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:09.749 
bag or something like that so a nice
feature<00:05:07.599> there

00:05:09.749 --> 00:05:09.759 
feature there

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:14.219 
feature there
I<00:05:10.169> guess<00:05:11.169> my<00:05:11.379> my<00:05:11.770> pros<00:05:12.669> and<00:05:12.940> cons<00:05:13.180> here<00:05:13.599> so<00:05:14.080> the

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:14.229 
I guess my my pros and cons here so the

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:15.869 
I guess my my pros and cons here so the
pros<00:05:14.500> are<00:05:14.770> that<00:05:14.800> this<00:05:15.190> is<00:05:15.250> really<00:05:15.639> lightweight

00:05:15.869 --> 00:05:15.879 
pros are that this is really lightweight
