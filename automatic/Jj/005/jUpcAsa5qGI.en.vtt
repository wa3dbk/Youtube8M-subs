think it would it would decrease the
value<00:02:36.570> I<00:02:36.750> mean<00:02:36.960> look<00:02:37.380> at<00:02:37.470> what<00:02:37.620> it<00:02:37.710> does<00:02:37.800> to

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
value I mean look at what it does to

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.800 
value I mean look at what it does to
jordans<00:02:38.370> were<00:02:38.550> like<00:02:38.760> the<00:02:38.910> penny<00:02:39.270> foamposites

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
jordans were like the penny foamposites

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.470 
jordans were like the penny foamposites
like<00:02:39.930> those<00:02:40.580> conchords<00:02:41.580> before<00:02:41.970> they<00:02:42.090> retro

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
like those conchords before they retro

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.970 
like those conchords before they retro
them<00:02:42.720> again<00:02:42.990> I<00:02:43.020> think<00:02:43.380> they<00:02:43.440> were<00:02:43.530> going<00:02:43.710> for

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
them again I think they were going for

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.800 
them again I think they were going for
four<00:02:44.220> or<00:02:44.250> five<00:02:44.340> something<00:02:44.880> hundred<00:02:45.120> and<00:02:45.540> it

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
four or five something hundred and it

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.470 
four or five something hundred and it
knocked<00:02:46.080> down<00:02:46.350> like<00:02:46.700> two<00:02:47.700> thirds<00:02:47.970> in<00:02:48.060> price<00:02:48.270> I

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
knocked down like two thirds in price I

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.610 
knocked down like two thirds in price I
mean<00:02:48.600> you<00:02:48.690> can<00:02:48.780> pick<00:02:49.110> them<00:02:49.230> up<00:02:49.260> for<00:02:49.380> probably

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
mean you can pick them up for probably

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.820 
mean you can pick them up for probably
three<00:02:50.100> hundred<00:02:50.340> or<00:02:50.460> so<00:02:50.700> or<00:02:51.030> whatever<00:02:51.270> now<00:02:51.830> the

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
myself if it gives more people the

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.250 
myself if it gives more people the
opportunity<00:03:26.670> to<00:03:26.730> be<00:03:26.760> able<00:03:26.850> to<00:03:27.000> buy<00:03:27.230> some<00:03:28.230> of

opportunity to be able to buy some of
those<00:03:28.380> sneakers<00:03:28.739> you<00:03:29.430> know<00:03:29.550> I'm<00:03:29.880> kind<00:03:30.090> of<00:03:30.120> torn

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.270 
those sneakers you know I'm kind of torn

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:31.640 
those sneakers you know I'm kind of torn
i<00:03:30.450> think<00:03:30.660> it's<00:03:30.780> it's<00:03:30.959> great<00:03:31.230> that<00:03:31.380> I<00:03:31.410> was<00:03:31.560> able

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
i think it's it's great that I was able

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.520 
i think it's it's great that I was able
to<00:03:31.830> cop<00:03:32.010> a<00:03:32.040> pair<00:03:32.310> when<00:03:32.820> I<00:03:32.850> did<00:03:33.120> I<00:03:33.660> feel<00:03:34.350> for

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
to cop a pair when I did I feel for

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:35.810 
to cop a pair when I did I feel for
those<00:03:34.620> that<00:03:34.860> want<00:03:34.920> them<00:03:35.220> that<00:03:35.370> couldn't<00:03:35.700> copy

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
those that want them that couldn't copy

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.199 
those that want them that couldn't copy
the<00:03:36.239> I<00:03:36.930> kind<00:03:37.560> of<00:03:37.620> i'm<00:03:37.980> torn<00:03:38.610> in<00:03:38.730> between<00:03:38.760> i

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
the I kind of i'm torn in between i

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.199 
the I kind of i'm torn in between i
think<00:03:39.450> it<00:03:39.570> could<00:03:40.350> generate<00:03:40.650> some<00:03:41.160> revenue<00:03:41.209> for

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
think it could generate some revenue for

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.330 
think it could generate some revenue for
for<00:03:42.420> nike<00:03:42.690> but<00:03:42.870> let's<00:03:43.530> be<00:03:43.709> honest<00:03:43.980> it<00:03:44.070> nike

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
for nike but let's be honest it nike

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.800 
for nike but let's be honest it nike
probably<00:03:44.640> doesn't<00:03:44.820> really<00:03:44.970> care<00:03:45.209> most<00:03:45.510> about

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
probably doesn't really care most about

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.400 
probably doesn't really care most about
the<00:03:46.739> the<00:03:47.310> revenue<00:03:47.730> I<00:03:47.940> think<00:03:48.900> that<00:03:49.020> Maggie

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
the the revenue I think that Maggie

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.020 
the the revenue I think that Maggie
smarten<00:03:49.800> they<00:03:49.860> look<00:03:50.010> long<00:03:50.220> term<00:03:50.250> because<00:03:50.790> they

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
smarten they look long term because they

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.210 
smarten they look long term because they

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:50.170 
mean the other sounds like a thousand
two<00:04:48.290> thousand<00:04:48.650> but<00:04:49.490> when<00:04:49.610> you<00:04:49.700> get<00:04:49.820> up<00:04:49.940> to<00:04:50.030> the
