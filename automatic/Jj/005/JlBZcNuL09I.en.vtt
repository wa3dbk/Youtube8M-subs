00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.510
 I'm Achilles Chávez and here I come to 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.270
 cook conscience and let's make a 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.150
 classic Yucatec child that we are going to make 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.380
 on a cibils mat but very 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.029
 modern 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.550
 the kitchen to live is a good dish 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.829
 traditional of Yucatan but it is done in 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.260
 civilian fact oven has the word 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.630
 maya fit that is oven on land but that 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.050
 think we're going to make it in a pot 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:45.840
 pressure and many people are afraid to use 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.719
 this type of hole but who believes that without 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.699
 a pot that has five was developed 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.469
 security systems so that it does not end 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:55.920
 in tragedy the cooked I'll start 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:59.850
 first of all they contribute neither spices 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.190
 because I'm going to make my marinade for me 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:07.440
 cochinita pibil here I have pepper 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:10.710
 fat a little bit of oregano and a little 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:13.380
 of cinnamon and what is important is that 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:17.460
 our spices begin to toast 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:20.340
 to pay and I'm going to make in my blender 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.890
 I will place a driver acció te 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.500
 commercial that has gastric shock 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:29.869
 It 's a luxury that is worth it and we're going 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:33.990
 to use orange juice and I'm going to put 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:37.500
 white cane vinegar vinegar 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:41.130
 baratito of the most common a jet and 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:44.850
 then here is going to be precisely the 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:49.159
 flavor of our orange and lemon 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:53.200
 I will add anything to me 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:59.049
 of pork and I'm going to mix 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:01.210
 tweezers because I let him talk too 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:03.899
 one of the advantages that the pot has 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:07.299
 pressure is that it reduces time and money 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:10.030
 especially many but many I'm going to 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:13.840
 do in some banana leaves I'm going to 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:16.660
 use only give a warm 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.540
 my leaves and do not break us at the time 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:22.180
 that we wrap our pork 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:25.260
 marinated good that other advantages have 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:28.409
 the liter of the pressure cooker 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.079
 and you can preserve all your juices and 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:34.409
 natural nutrients are cooked in their 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:36.930
 own juices and how they do not evaporate 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:39.390
 you are spinning around in it 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.610
 cubes and that will also make the 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:46.049
 things are good 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:48.510
 pressure cooker I have my grid with crazy 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:52.459
 what I had told him I leafed through 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.459
 banana and about this 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.110
 he said me that the pressure cooker 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.570
 they have 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.970
 I made some advantages as a result of what 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:03.190
 we cook their kitchens there with their 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.530
 own juices and will conserve their 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.470
 natural nutrients because everything 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.880
 literally stays there is already great 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.270
 accounts is malnutrition 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:16.180
 that's taste and economy because in the 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:18.460
 pressure cooker when they are already starting to 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.280
 be noisy from there we go to 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:23.950
 count the time and we will lower the 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.200
 temperature then what will happen that 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:29.230
 things cook much faster 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.720
 that we are well gassed and this is that 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:36.700
 I tell you that saving an economy 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:37.840
 we cover those from here and coffee as well 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.170
 Quick 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:45.280
 click and let's start cooking our 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:47.410
 cook 45 minutes apart from starting 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.590
 to be unique I'm going to make two onions 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:53.800
 can do one for adults and one 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:57.610
 for the kids we are going to silence well 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:04:00.000
 finite my onion and on each one 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.000
 I will add 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.990
 a little bit of salt and a little bit of 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.890
 oregano 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:13.070
 pretty and we're going to do the adults 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:15.170
 some finite habanero chiles that 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:18.320
 today under pressure and is making noise the 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:21.250
 valve is dancing to what good I am a 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:24.050
 please, I'm going to start cleaning 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:26.770
 while and cochinita is finished 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.770
 Cook 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:48.940
 once the 45 minutes have passed or the 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:51.190
 Cochinita pibil in a fast way and 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.770
 see just what a most wonderful thing 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.560
 the cochinita a cochinita that is a 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.530
 typical dish 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.930
 dedicate yourself here that seems complicated but 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.419
 it's very easy to do and because we say 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:06.690
 in a pressure cooker and I can not stand the 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:09.750
 temptation to make a taquito see 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:12.660
 just like the meat gets rid of that 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:15.090
 It is super well cooked but very juicy 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:17.250
 because it is precisely the advantages that 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:18.300
 we have when we cook in a pot 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:21.180
 Pressure 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:24.000
 a little bit of onions and I am here 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:28.040
 of salts and here 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.040
 and here I am going to use this tractor
