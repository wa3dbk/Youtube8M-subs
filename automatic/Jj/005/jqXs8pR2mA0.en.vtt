00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.740

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.250
 so let's start right away and go to 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:20.939
 see what it is then 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:23.430

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.640
 home after trying this game 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:32.420

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:35.610
 say we have to be this 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:39.090
 red knowledge on this car 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.530
 black so far quite simple take ex 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.239
 lea 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.370
 we take in jeans ok this is the first one 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.289
 thing to do 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.739
 from what he can hold there is something 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:52.320
 in your stomach that is wrong here 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.239
 are three doors we were wrong but ok 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.920
 we went to the door 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.829
 stomach operations 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.570
 we continue senses 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.670
 we are already the experienced doctors not 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.960
 We need to read these stupid things 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:09.900
 then air tube claims ok some 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.780
 stuff in english no we were wrong 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.540
 ok we're messing with the patient 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.070
 he would have been dead by now but finally 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:22.220
 we took the right thing 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:29.090
 what is it because they have to put it there 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:33.210
 that sucks enough then we put 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:36.180
 chisel no we did wrong train who 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.520

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.770
 a little blindly they are announced already was 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.270
 the only thing that was not clicked was that 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.520

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:48.110

 great now ice cube ok this time 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.190
 we immediately looked for a perfect tube 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.750
 air 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:05.630
 now we turn on the all on 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:10.289
 perfect and now ok what should be done 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:17.330

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:24.450
 chisel in the flute yard with hears 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.750
 but I understand my name is everything because 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:31.140
 what we must do here is what it is 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:35.250
 draw type of cotton here and clean 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:42.750
 perfect now i would say take a 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:45.530
 knife to open here ok a year earlier a 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.510
 marker to mark the crucial points 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:52.250
 that is calm that you are in good hands 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:57.540

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:59.970

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.620
 we are doing a good job we are 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:06.269
 doing a good job 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:08.940
 now I hear the heartbeats 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.989
 ok here if there are the motions of the heart is one 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.660

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.470
 ok 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:25.410
 what should we do with this beautiful 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:30.630
 tool ok we have to raise the blood 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:34.350
 now we have to take things and what 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:40.920

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:43.049
 oh ok this is a bit disgusting that 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:49.019
 it sucks or something we must 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:52.950
 then take the claps again says 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:56.010
 so we moved something I don't know 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:58.410
 what was i think was the intestine now 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:01.290
 what else we have to move to take 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.299
 the chisel that is the translation into 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.120
 Italian and I don't know if it is scarp however 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:09.660
 we call the trento chisel 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.889
 we did an excellent engraving or 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.840
 which is our patient can stand 

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:15.989
 be quiet with us because we are gods 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.630
 perfect doctors and experts now 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:20.449
 take a video camera to see 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.889
 what's inside here 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:25.440
 let's see let's see what he ate 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:27.750
 our girls don't like a marble 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.610
 the marbles there are very good 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:34.490
 I recommend eating in large quantities 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:37.650
 so now let's take the tweezers 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:41.000
 let's stay in here it's done 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:46.040
 we have raised the thick ball now 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.040
 is that we must rest the stomach 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:54.240
 we are doing it perfect, that is, now 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:05:00.350
 We raise all these things 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:05:04.500
 all ok, get all the tweezers 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:06.900
 and now all that remains is to stitch this together 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:10.740

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.790
 we saved our patient that 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.729

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:35.770
 fucking vineyard 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:38.830

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:43.719
