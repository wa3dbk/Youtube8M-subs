00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
seventh chord during this tutorial we'll

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.700 
seventh chord during this tutorial we'll
look<00:00:17.820> at<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.120> major<00:00:18.330> seventh<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.410> minor

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
look at the major seventh the minor

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.880 
look at the major seventh the minor
seventh<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.940> dominant<00:00:21.360> seventh<00:00:21.890> in

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
order to understand this tutorial you

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.160 
order to understand this tutorial you
should<00:00:25.679> know<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.429> major<00:00:26.640> scale<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.929> minor

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
should know the major scale the minor

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.330 
should know the major scale the minor
natural<00:00:28.439> scale<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.880> mixolydian<00:00:30.359> scale

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.980 
natural scale and the mixolydian scale
it's<00:00:32.340> also<00:00:32.490> useful<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:33.210> go<00:00:33.360> over<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.780> lesson

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:33.990 
it's also useful to go over the lesson

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:37.400 
it's also useful to go over the lesson

map<00:00:40.410> would<00:00:40.620> be<00:00:40.770> useful<00:00:40.950> for<00:00:41.340> reference<00:00:42.890> the

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
map would be useful for reference the

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.350 
map would be useful for reference the

structure of the major 7th chord the

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.810 
structure of the major 7th chord the
major<00:00:48.600> 7th<00:00:49.140> chord<00:00:49.469> is<00:00:49.649> derived<00:00:50.370> from<00:00:50.520> the

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
major 7th chord is derived from the

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.630 
major 7th chord is derived from the
notes<00:00:51.059> in<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.390> major<00:00:51.930> scale<00:00:52.199> for<00:00:52.680> this

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
notes in the major scale for this

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.229 
notes in the major scale for this
tutorial<00:00:53.910> we'll<00:00:54.750> use<00:00:54.809> C<00:00:55.320> major<00:00:55.969> the<00:00:56.969> first

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
tutorial we'll use C major the first

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.599 
tutorial we'll use C major the first
step<00:00:57.570> is<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.289> find<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.620> triad<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.399> major

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
step is to find the triad of the major

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.740 
step is to find the triad of the major
scale<00:01:00.140> the<00:01:01.140> Triad<00:01:01.469> is<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:02.280> first<00:01:02.579> third<00:01:03.510> and

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
scale the Triad is the first third and

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.570 
scale the Triad is the first third and
fifth<00:01:03.840> note<00:01:05.090> the<00:01:06.090> C<00:01:06.360> major<00:01:06.600> triad<00:01:06.930> then<00:01:07.380> is<00:01:07.590> C<00:01:08.280> E

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
fifth note the C major triad then is C E

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.230 
fifth note the C major triad then is C E
and<00:01:09.390> G<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.350> this<00:01:10.979> is<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.280> basic<00:01:11.700> structure<00:01:12.000> of

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
and G and this is the basic structure of

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.740 
and G and this is the basic structure of
the<00:01:12.450> C<00:01:12.780> major<00:01:12.810> chord<00:01:13.850> to<00:01:14.850> complete<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.509> notes

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
the C major chord to complete the notes

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.950 
the C major chord to complete the notes
needed<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.710> construct<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.369> major<00:01:17.580> 7th<00:01:18.030> chord<00:01:18.299> we

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
needed to construct a major 7th chord we

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.100 
needed to construct a major 7th chord we
take<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.380> major<00:01:19.590> triad<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.340> now<00:01:20.939> add<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.659> 7th

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
take the major triad and now add the 7th

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.300 
take the major triad and now add the 7th
note<00:01:22.439> of<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.920> major<00:01:23.100> scale<00:01:23.630> this<00:01:24.630> is<00:01:24.930> B

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
note of the major scale this is B

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.200 
note of the major scale this is B
so<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.600> notes<00:01:27.869> required<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.740> make<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:29.130> C<00:01:29.610> major

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
so the notes required to make a C major

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.980 
so the notes required to make a C major
seventh<00:01:30.750> chord<00:01:30.810> or<00:01:31.460> c<00:01:32.460> e<00:01:33.290> G<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.770> B<00:01:35.540> this<00:01:36.540> can<00:01:36.869> be

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
seventh chord or c e G and B this can be

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.399 
seventh chord or c e G and B this can be
demonstrated<00:01:37.369> by<00:01:38.369> taking<00:01:38.850> a<00:01:39.000> C<00:01:39.360> major<00:01:39.840> open

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
demonstrated by taking a C major open

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.580 
demonstrated by taking a C major open
chord<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:41.520> converting<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.330> to<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.540> C<00:01:42.840> major<00:01:43.080> 7th

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
chord and converting it to a C major 7th

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.700 
chord and converting it to a C major 7th
open<00:01:43.979> chord<00:01:44.570> this<00:01:45.570> can<00:01:45.840> be<00:01:45.990> done<00:01:46.170> by<00:01:46.470> taking

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
open chord this can be done by taking

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.730 
open chord this can be done by taking
the<00:01:47.070> first<00:01:47.340> finger<00:01:47.909> which<00:01:48.509> is<00:01:48.720> a<00:01:48.750> C<00:01:49.080> and

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
the first finger which is a C and

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.910 
the first finger which is a C and
removing<00:01:50.369> it<00:01:50.479> exposing<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.690> be<00:01:51.899> open<00:01:52.680> string

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
removing it exposing the be open string

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.630 
removing it exposing the be open string
this<00:01:53.909> now<00:01:54.210> then<00:01:54.479> is<00:01:54.720> a<00:01:54.780> seen<00:01:55.229> major<00:01:55.530> 7th<00:01:56.009> open

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
this now then is a seen major 7th open

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.030 
this now then is a seen major 7th open
chord

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
chord

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.980 
chord
there<00:01:58.640> are<00:01:58.760> several<00:01:58.970> different<00:01:59.450> ways<00:01:59.480> to<00:01:59.870> play

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
there are several different ways to play

shared the same notes even though the

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.840 
shared the same notes even though the

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.410 
notes of the minor natural scale in this
case<00:02:20.690> we<00:02:21.140> will<00:02:21.320> use<00:02:21.350> the<00:02:21.830> a<00:02:21.980> minor<00:02:22.910> natural

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
case we will use the a minor natural

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.820 
case we will use the a minor natural
scale<00:02:24.790> to<00:02:25.790> find<00:02:26.030> the<00:02:26.150> notes<00:02:26.390> of<00:02:26.660> the<00:02:27.140> minor<00:02:27.380> 7th

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.430 
scale to find the notes of the minor 7th
chord<00:02:27.890> we<00:02:28.580> use<00:02:28.760> exactly<00:02:29.300> the<00:02:29.450> same<00:02:29.660> formula<00:02:30.020> as

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
chord we use exactly the same formula as

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.400 
chord we use exactly the same formula as
we<00:02:30.770> did<00:02:30.950> for<00:02:31.190> the<00:02:31.280> major<00:02:31.490> 7th<00:02:31.910> chord<00:02:32.180> that<00:02:33.110> is

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
we did for the major 7th chord that is

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.580 
we did for the major 7th chord that is
the<00:02:33.980> first<00:02:34.280> note<00:02:34.580> of<00:02:34.610> the<00:02:34.820> scale<00:02:35.020> the<00:02:36.020> 3rd<00:02:36.290> note

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590
