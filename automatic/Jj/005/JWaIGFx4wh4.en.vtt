00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.190
 Wow 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:19.020
 you want to play will also have 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.700
 funny and now the white girl spoke of 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.040
 twice here to another video of the 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.500
 single flanges and today bringing 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:28.320
 to you our short place there that I 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.750
 I caught playing dn support does not bump 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.620
 anime to testify in indignant tone and everything else 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.510
 is the title of the video is not on the n 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.460
 Because it's going to take an hour, I think it's the 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.590
 second clip that does not know you're done 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.480
 taking a little because the defendant 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.220
 He ended up coming back half and I radu 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.809
 I managed to study it and how it is already 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.430
 stopped with his uncle 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.199
 I enjoyed getting a snack 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.470
 leaving here to thank and that's it 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:55.650
 I live but I've put the support 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:58.860
 that game night every month but also 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.809
 five then can be can be can 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.890
 say it was not so printed and so the 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:07.170
 whole match I have the match 10/5 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.540
 too much has not done much if 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.670
 the exam is supported 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.610
 I think I just lost the game. 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.530
 I think if I had left more 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.930
 kills for my team I think it would 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.030
 To win the match, I went with the 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.480
 mine is something that is always good 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.450
 I think you missed what I ask for a 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.700
 little sad and did so and if you 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.770
 improve in the game I do not say that I am 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.930
 Good, but I feel I can improve. 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.830
 your with your focus is on the things that I did 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.420
 wrong while starting 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:43.350
 Maybe I could have helped my 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:46.140
 team not only help by killing others but 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.060

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.190

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.160
 People who already know a little I'm still 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.730
 novice in so saying the game has a one 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.290
 mail to 2000 main account for 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.810
 Just as I stopped playing a little 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.780
 normal in the same practice by a 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.610
 of the most ctc hour clips for and games 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.230
 My friends are silly then. 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.870
 I can use it to climb it, I want it. 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.430
 leave the platinum and the final goal is 30 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.760
 period at the end of the night but sisu 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.920
 I still have a little more but that's what I 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.690
 I wanted to talk to you, it 's expression. 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.910
 tanned play cn 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.520
 and for those who like flash connectivity and I hope 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.980
 enjoy is the videos you are listening to on 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.690
 channel, and for those who do not know the flash 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.160
 not bringing more and more videos 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.840
 showing you how it works 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.780
 the game and everything else for those who have 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.670
 interest also to start playing and 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.890
 can not improve because far away is not 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.920
 complicated in the beginning of that you play 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.870
 because there was a lot of shit you run out 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.820
 talking things you should not and 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:28.210
 mechanically it is very difficult to 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:32.020
 get used to it when you get used to it 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:33.370
 fucking is very easy to play it flows 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:35.680
 very fast if you can get 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.530
 get used to it so it turns out to be 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.400
 an automatic thing if it explains right 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.260
 it's that 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.930
 is the notion of game ended up getting 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:47.410
 automatic 7 for the new one needs to stay 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.780
 Thinking, this is what we have to do. 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:54.940
 Automatically finish everything 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:57.700
 sometimes it's good tonight , tomorrow or later 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.930
 I can already video showing you the 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.880
 that he goose the people to whom not 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.260
 and how the channel was focused on 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.090
 causes the future 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.080
 so I want to introduce my things 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.450

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.920
