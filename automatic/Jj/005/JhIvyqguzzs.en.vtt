engine<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.619> enhance<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:13.979> graphics<00:01:14.400> during<00:01:14.939> a

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
engine to enhance the graphics during a

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
good hard with a single player and I

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.020 
good hard with a single player and I
also<00:01:19.259> believe<00:01:19.799> that<00:01:19.830> there<00:01:20.759> were<00:01:20.850> some

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
also believe that there were some

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.340 
also believe that there were some
glitches<00:01:21.119> in<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.479> game<00:01:21.630> when<00:01:21.780> I<00:01:21.810> played<00:01:22.140> that

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
glitches in the game when I played that

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.039 
glitches in the game when I played that
should<00:01:22.740> be<00:01:22.860> fixed<00:01:23.100> for<00:01:23.700> example<00:01:24.119> it<00:01:24.570> was<00:01:24.780> where

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
should be fixed for example it was where

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.539 
should be fixed for example it was where
the<00:01:25.380> aim<00:01:25.530> of<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.799> gun<00:01:25.920> disappeared<00:01:26.430> during

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
the aim of the gun disappeared during

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.070 
the aim of the gun disappeared during
multiplayer<00:01:27.030> but<00:01:27.150> it<00:01:27.240> wasn't<00:01:27.420> as<00:01:27.479> for<00:01:27.630> me<00:01:27.720> is

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
multiplayer but it wasn't as for me is

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.149 
multiplayer but it wasn't as for me is
that<00:01:28.200> one<00:01:28.350> on<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.500> map<00:01:28.650> so<00:01:28.799> you<00:01:28.860> couldn't<00:01:29.070> name

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
that one on the map so you couldn't name

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.590 
that one on the map so you couldn't name
again<00:01:29.430> which<00:01:29.520> I<00:01:29.610> felt<00:01:29.790> was<00:01:29.880> kind<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.390> problem

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.289 
again which I felt was kind of a problem
also<00:01:31.590> there<00:01:31.740> was<00:01:31.799> a<00:01:31.860> glitch<00:01:32.009> where<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:33.000> person

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
also there was a glitch where the person

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.179 
also there was a glitch where the person
molecule<00:01:33.630> I<00:01:33.659> was<00:01:33.810> shooting<00:01:33.869> at<00:01:34.110> lag<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:35.159> I

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
molecule I was shooting at lag so I

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.350 
molecule I was shooting at lag so I
haven't<00:01:35.369> lived<00:01:35.549> two<00:01:35.759> clips<00:01:35.970> on<00:01:36.090> them<00:01:36.270> and

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
haven't lived two clips on them and

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.179 
haven't lived two clips on them and
stabbed<00:01:36.570> in<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.689> twice<00:01:36.930> before<00:01:37.140> they<00:01:37.259> died<00:01:37.530> so

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
stabbed in the twice before they died so

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.560 
stabbed in the twice before they died so
I<00:01:38.220> basically<00:01:38.520> kill<00:01:38.790> them<00:01:38.939> four<00:01:39.150> times<00:01:39.180> over

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
I basically kill them four times over

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.630 
I basically kill them four times over
before<00:01:40.500> they<00:01:40.590> died<00:01:40.799> this<00:01:41.070> part<00:01:41.280> of<00:01:41.340> realism

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
before they died this part of realism

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.100 
before they died this part of realism
the<00:01:41.909> game<00:01:42.060> was<00:01:42.180> very<00:01:42.360> realistic<00:01:42.689> put<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:42.960> guns

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
the game was very realistic put the guns

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.109 
the game was very realistic put the guns
being<00:01:43.320> accurate<00:01:43.649> down<00:01:43.799> they<00:01:44.040> would<00:01:44.670> fire<00:01:44.909> and

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
being accurate down they would fire and

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.090 
being accurate down they would fire and
be<00:01:45.240> in<00:01:45.329> real<00:01:45.479> life<00:01:45.689> and<00:01:45.930> you're<00:01:46.799> able<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.070> pick

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
the Chris submachine gun and I would

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
give the game of a 10 out of 10 for find

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.260 
give the game of a 10 out of 10 for find
