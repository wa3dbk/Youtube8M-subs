00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:07.350
 hello in this video review i want 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.179
 tell you about two models of hydra 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.719
 wings from the Taiwanese manufacturer and 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:16.230
 country 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:17.910
 these are models from the 88th 62 and from 88 notes 61 on 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.130
 in fact it is one of the most inexpensive 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.660
 hydra wings for today and price 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.039
 in our online store they are not 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.789
 exceeds more rubles and for those who want 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:27.779
 experiment with installing hydra 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.390
 wing on your motor 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.090
 This is a very good option so let's 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.940
 consider in more detail these models as 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.489
 see it factory purchase it was their 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.559
 plastic blister 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:43.110
 model c80 8.1 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.480
 bit more and it is positioned for 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:49.350
 motors up to 200 horsepower 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.660
 model output 80 is 62 Guibert transportation 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.739
 smaller and from the manufacturer 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:59.390
 have a recommendation of 250 horsepower 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.390
 let's take this little one 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:11.030
 packaging as you see hydra forged consists 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.030
 of the two halves 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:20.320
 also included instruction 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:22.200
 with mounting recommendations and kit 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.350
 fastener which consists of four 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.520
 bolts 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:32.159
 4 self-locking burns and eight pucks and 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:40.119
 all made of stainless steel 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:48.369
 another box also we see hydra whom 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:53.320
 consists of 2 logical and services at the same time 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:02:00.429
 The instruction is absolutely one with 1 and 2 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:02:02.619
 kit similar kit for 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:04.539
 installations can see that 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:07.390
 constructively this wing reminds 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:10.149
 aircraft wing bowl on him act 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.880
 same physical laws area 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:15.370
 the upper part is larger than the lower area 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.310
 parts and therefore movement in density 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.070
 there is no lift which is 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.540
 bottom up and raise this hydra 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.000
 grams accordingly if we 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:29.079
 motor mounted on motor installed 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.400
 on the boat then with increasing speed the whole 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:32.799
 This design will be committed 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.620
 climb up on top surface 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:38.980
 here are the thighs of the wing 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:42.150
 notches whose task is to stabilize 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.920
 water flow so that it does not smear 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:48.000
 chela in a certain board task 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:53.019
 it will improve hydrodynamic properties 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:56.040
 also on the younger model are the same notches 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.040
 and another element 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.849
 whose task is again stabilization 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.769
 flow here is such an element again you can 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:05.500
 see on the wing of the plane only usually 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:07.739
 water is turned up here 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.739
 is below respectively for 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:14.049
 the best hydrodynamics made such 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:15.310
 stabilizer from this angle you can 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:18.840
 estimate real size 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:23.440
 hydrocele as you can see the model 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:25.720
 88 but 62 is noticeably less than 80 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:29.650
 and here on the subject and this is not the only thing 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:34.359
 difference because when installing this 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:36.660
 hydroxide tips models will be raised 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:40.420
 upstairs 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:44.110
 In this model, this is not they will 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:46.180
 can be strictly horizontally 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.830
 there is a natural question why in 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.210
 one model 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:55.480
 wings is in horizontal 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:57.370
 plane and in another limit switches understandable 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.900
 probably the fact is that this model 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.410
 designed for motors small 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.590
 power and critical for them 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.120
 resistance 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:08.740
 opened the oncoming flow and 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.630
 in order for it to just lower it 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:13.060
 resistance is already in the lowering mode 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:16.450
 Such a form is chosen because when 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.910
 the boat is already in lessor mode 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.230
 wing 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:22.480
 rises from the water accordingly not 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:26.160
 has no resistance but 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:29.320
 cornering will have you work these here 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:32.280
 hydrodynamic elements that will be 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:35.620
 stabilize from the boat not to give 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:38.890
 screwed screw here and at the moment 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.210
 when the boat goes to gliding then 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:42.970
 there is this whole construction will be 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:45.000
 immersed underneath here and will perform 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.380
 its immediate functions 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.480
 help vodka get out near believers mode 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.190
 as here someone came out a lessor mode 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.810
 us 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:57.379
 climb such elements and say 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:05:00.229
 50 percent here these wings will be 

00:04:57.379 --> 00:05:02.810
 be already on the air and do not interfere 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:05.150
 one is not now about the method of attachment as 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:08.000
 you probably guessed the wings 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:11.870
 mounted on an anti-gravity plate with 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.750
 using bolts and burn and for that you 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:17.259
 need to make a hole on 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:20.030
 your motor's anti-gravity plate 

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:24.440
 respectively, two holes with the right 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:28.580
 side two drain holes then put on 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:29.629
 wings well here it is and secure with 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:33.740
 this fastener 

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:37.539
 the instructions show what is starting up 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:41.030
 a washer is put on the bottom of the bolt afterwards 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:44.259
 above another puck and above already 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:46.940
 self-locking nut tightens 

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:47.469
 That's exactly the way described in 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:51.620
 instructions 

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:56.270
 also note that the model 8880 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:57.669
 one sits down on his own vi path 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:02.259
 slab 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:02.259
 practically parallel to the plate itself 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:09.830
 88 notes 62 

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:13.759
 at installation you see that it is displaced 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:19.300
 the part is closer to the feed that is, it sits down 

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:24.139
 deeper and that is how this wing is made 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:26.690
 this is not some kind of brother or 

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:27.169
 flaw that is all led from this 

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:30.199
 models 

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:32.599
 it does not sit down parallel to a little 

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:35.449
 with a shift in the stern have it in mind 

00:06:32.599 --> 00:06:36.920
 Now for example, I set the data 

00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:39.290
 hydra wings 

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:42.980
 one of suzuki's portable motors 

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:45.380
 model 15 either you horsepower you 

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:49.600
 look how they already sit in one place 

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:49.600
 it is on the antigravity plate 

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:16.470
 but since we have model 88 061 

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:18.020
 positioned for motors up to 200 

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:22.349
 horsepower i think makes sense 

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:27.310
 put this hydroplane field powerful 

00:07:22.349 --> 00:07:29.770
 motor from for example let's take 100 

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:32.490
 just so great it will look on 

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:32.490
 this motor 

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:38.890
 Well, I hope this video will help you 

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:40.000
 to decide on the choice of accessories for 

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:41.770
 your motor 

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.780
 I want to note that in our Internet 

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:45.850
 the store the choice of hydra wings is not 

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:49.330
 limited by the manufacturer 

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:51.340
 Internet also you can choose others 

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:53.440
 manufacturers and more importantly 

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:55.600
 there are such hydra wings that are not 

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:58.510
 requires drilling antique rotary 

00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:00.540
 plates and they are here in our internet 

00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:00.540
 the store
