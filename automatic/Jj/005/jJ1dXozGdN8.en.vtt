00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
very vented helmet it is gonna be a

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.529 
very vented helmet it is gonna be a
little<00:00:23.160> bit<00:00:23.310> more<00:00:23.430> difficult<00:00:23.970> to<00:00:24.029> get<00:00:24.330> this

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
little bit more difficult to get this

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.080 
little bit more difficult to get this
into<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.560> exact<00:00:25.859> position<00:00:26.070> you<00:00:26.340> want<00:00:26.580> but<00:00:26.880> as

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
into the exact position you want but as

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.269 
into the exact position you want but as
long<00:00:27.269> as<00:00:27.300> you've<00:00:27.570> got<00:00:27.619> three<00:00:28.619> or<00:00:28.710> four<00:00:28.740> it

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
long as you've got three or four it

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.780 
long as you've got three or four it
should<00:00:29.519> be<00:00:29.670> possible<00:00:31.160> I'm<00:00:32.160> gonna<00:00:32.369> start<00:00:32.669> by

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
should be possible I'm gonna start by

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.310 
should be possible I'm gonna start by
figuring<00:00:33.000> out<00:00:33.210> exactly<00:00:33.329> where<00:00:33.960> I<00:00:33.989> want<00:00:34.230> my

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
figuring out exactly where I want my

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.770 
figuring out exactly where I want my
mount<00:00:34.530> to<00:00:34.649> sit<00:00:34.920> I'm<00:00:35.550> thinking<00:00:36.270> that<00:00:36.450> right

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
mount to sit I'm thinking that right

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.040 
mount to sit I'm thinking that right
about<00:00:37.170> here<00:00:37.800> looks<00:00:38.340> pretty<00:00:38.430> good<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.050> then

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
about here looks pretty good and then

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.139 
about here looks pretty good and then
I'm<00:00:40.290> gonna<00:00:40.440> look<00:00:40.649> at<00:00:40.829> what<00:00:40.980> some<00:00:41.070> vents<00:00:41.850> I<00:00:41.940> want

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
I'm gonna look at what some vents I want

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.549 
I'm gonna look at what some vents I want
my<00:00:42.239> straps<00:00:42.540> to<00:00:42.690> go<00:00:42.719> through<00:00:42.989> so<00:00:43.140> I'm<00:00:43.230> thinking

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
my straps to go through so I'm thinking

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.130 
my straps to go through so I'm thinking
I'm<00:00:43.620> gonna<00:00:43.770> go<00:00:43.890> down<00:00:44.160> these<00:00:44.520> two<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.059> then<00:00:46.020> I'm

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
I'm gonna go down these two and then I'm

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.700 
I'm gonna go down these two and then I'm
probably<00:00:46.350> going<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.680> come<00:00:46.920> back<00:00:47.070> up<00:00:47.129> these<00:00:47.969> two

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
probably going to come back up these two

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.750 
probably going to come back up these two
it's<00:00:49.710> important<00:00:50.129> that<00:00:50.160> this<00:00:50.309> strap<00:00:50.550> has<00:00:50.730> a

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
it's important that this strap has a

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.220 
it's important that this strap has a
good<00:00:52.129> beam<00:00:53.129> or<00:00:53.460> post<00:00:53.760> here<00:00:54.059> in<00:00:54.420> this<00:00:54.840> case<00:00:55.079> to

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
good beam or post here in this case to

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.500 
good beam or post here in this case to
go<00:00:55.410> around<00:00:55.649> so<00:00:55.949> I'm<00:00:56.579> gonna<00:00:56.850> start<00:00:57.210> with<00:00:57.329> this

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
go around so I'm gonna start with this

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.810 
go around so I'm gonna start with this
side<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:58.109> I'm<00:00:58.230> gonna<00:00:58.350> pass<00:00:58.680> my<00:00:58.710> strap<00:00:59.250> down<00:00:59.520> it

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820

just like that now I'm going to just

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.929 
just like that now I'm going to just

through the clips not pulling them too
tight<00:01:40.320> just<00:01:40.920> yet<00:01:41.460> I'm<00:01:42.390> also<00:01:42.990> not<00:01:43.290> closing<00:01:43.890> down

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
tight just yet I'm also not closing down

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.429

the<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.880> straps<00:01:45.210> now<00:01:45.930> this<00:01:46.049> is<00:01:46.140> when<00:01:46.290> it's

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
the the straps now this is when it's

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.120 
the the straps now this is when it's
important<00:01:46.920> you've<00:01:47.040> got<00:01:47.189> to<00:01:47.310> pull<00:01:48.799> like<00:01:49.799> this

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
important you've got to pull like this

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.730 
important you've got to pull like this
on<00:01:50.399> both<00:01:50.820> of<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.119> straps<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:52.079> put<00:01:52.290> on<00:01:52.409> equal

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
on both of the straps to put on equal

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.670 
on both of the straps to put on equal
pressure<00:01:53.040> on<00:01:53.250> either<00:01:54.200> sides<00:01:55.200> need<00:01:55.439> equal

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
pressure on either sides need equal

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.499 
pressure on either sides need equal
pressure<00:01:55.950> so<00:01:56.850> you<00:01:56.939> don't<00:01:57.090> really<00:01:57.240> want<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.390> do

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
pressure so you don't really want to do

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:58.609 
pressure so you don't really want to do
the<00:01:57.600> one<00:01:57.840> up<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.110> then<00:01:58.200> pull<00:01:58.409> in<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.560> other

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
the one up and then pull in the other

00:01:58.619 --> 00:01:59.870 
the one up and then pull in the other
one<00:01:58.829> you<00:01:58.890> want<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.100> do<00:01:59.189> them<00:01:59.340> both<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.670> same

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
one you want to do them both the same

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.940 
one you want to do them both the same
time<00:02:00.119> so<00:02:00.810> I'm<00:02:00.930> pulling<00:02:01.320> on<00:02:01.409> both<00:02:01.710> of<00:02:01.860> these

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
time so I'm pulling on both of these

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.609 
time so I'm pulling on both of these
