00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.279
 email I will prepare 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.650
 a rich cabbage salad and we are here 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:26.230
 of grilled meat or barbecue with 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:28.400
 children know who you are to take care of and there 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:32.060
 so what do you think if we start 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:34.910
 cutting purple cabbage and green cabbage 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.950
 a question can this use a 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.620
 potato grater if they want the chicken 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.150
 more finite this salad is excellent 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.550
 for when you have a barbecue in 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:46.100
 home so you do not eat so many tortillas 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.110
 or eat so much meat you can accompany 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.730
 always with a cabbage salad that you 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.160
 will help a lot for digestion 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:55.770
 especially when we eat red meats 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.030
 and a way to get your children 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.310
 they start to eat vegetables is 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.290
 they involved the kitchens to involve them 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.910
 in fun things that will help you little 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.070
 little and you'll see that in that way they're going to 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.740
 feel proud of what they prepared and 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.040
 they will start to eat cabbage not 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.040
 vouchers 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.270
 let's cut now a little onion 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.490
 the amounts the onion around 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.189
 a quarter of onion is going to be a 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.850
 just a little bit to give it more flavor and 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:26.159
 we are cutting the finely 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.600
 why do not you put the grated carrot 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.020
 carrots and we will add the 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.020
 salad 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.780
 and cut the onion very finite so that 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.310
 do not feel the taste so strong inside 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.070
 of the salad what we want is for you 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.850
 give a little touch but you do not know how to feel 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.950
 well the onion 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.070
 now yes place the guide is that is 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.080
 ground is not going to put is 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.360
 here 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.369
 do not 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.799
 and now naomi is going to help us rinse 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:00.830
 the salad we are going to take it to wash the 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:03.890
 anemones amounts around each 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.750
 two cups of purple cabbage and two cups 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.179
 of green and around two carrots 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.220
 I'm going to add a big spoonful that 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.470
 they are like two of the normal mayonnaise 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.959
 to mix here and we're going to add 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.209
 also a spoonful of yogurt that 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.470
 We have natural yogurt here or can 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.910
 be gray yogurt is the Greek yogurt 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.340
 as well 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.960
 there goes this will help us to 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.940
 replace it instead of the cream that 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.920
 contain less fat apart than also 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.020
 It is helpful for digestion slightly 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.050
 of salt to taste and here we had 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:36.810
 also pepper and there the boys 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:40.740
 are doing that with oranges and 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:43.230
 they are squeezing the oranges 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:46.440
 now if you spend the month of orange juice 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:50.040

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.830
 Jewish half-orange juice is us 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.400
 it annoys the helpers because naomi los 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.400
 full 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.069
 because you do not want to help us anymore 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.689
 Now let's put a little bit of 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:04.780
 pepper in ahome will help us put 

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:08.470
