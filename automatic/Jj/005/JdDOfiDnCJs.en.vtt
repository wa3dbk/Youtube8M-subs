00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.429
 in the so-called finally sometimes have to speak in German 

00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:08.300
 Various pieces of glass will merge at FC Köln 780 to 900 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.149
 Grad fused together 

00:00:10.149 --> 00:00:14.309
 the set temperatures are always on the composition of the glass 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:15.900
 and its ceiling dependent 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.750
 This makes quick tempo 2 changes when editing glass tension 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:20.470
 arise 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.429
 the artist used for the pain used digitally controlled special crane 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:25.119
 check 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.640
 in these fires Fon the so-called Branco can be set white 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.570
 Then the glass is always on the before for a certain time 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.130
 heated temperature and it is allowed to cool very slowly at the end 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.210
 The production of such conclusion in pieces therefore requires a lot of knowledge 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.010
 the process technology and a dr euro home who access for the 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.250
 glass processing 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.590
 Vollstadt recorded Brändle then became unstable structures and visible 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.340
 Lead quantities of the piece of jewelry 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.450
 such a closing emblazoned there over several hours must have regularly 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.750
 checked and possibly the print embratur manually changed 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.030
 The finished product product percent can always be different 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.240
 Every glass in its structure turns out differently 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.360
 Per cent, according to archaeological research, the promenade was the 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.380
 River and technology developed more than 2200 years ago 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.700
 but only since the last decades was the technique of the preliminary work Unken 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.790
 is getting more and more 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.420
 Perfectly imitated and refined percent so that you meanwhile from too 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.460
 Design structures and shapes 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.020
 The closing articles offered by Antlers craftsmen are 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.340
 mainly much is the chromatic SLAs 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.500
 which was steamed with different colored luminous metals and in the form 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.700
 has very different structures 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.680
 this the chromatic glass 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.140
 will then see through Theo with transparent different forms 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.200
 Class covered by the combination of Theo Siegen and the chromatic 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.200
 Blast it arises from incidence of light from different angles again and again 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.870
 the glowing colors have an effect on it
