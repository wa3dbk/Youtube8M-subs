00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
use a spanner they're amazing

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.260 
use a spanner they're amazing
and<00:02:39.840> then<00:02:39.930> this<00:02:40.730> opens<00:02:41.730> and<00:02:41.880> close<00:02:42.030> to<00:02:42.180> the

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
and then this opens and close to the

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:48.979 
and then this opens and close to the
aperture<00:02:42.720> you<00:02:42.870> just<00:02:43.020> want<00:02:43.200> undo<00:02:43.470> this<00:02:47.989> then

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
aperture you just want undo this then

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.380 
aperture you just want undo this then
there's<00:02:49.290> three<00:02:49.440> screws<00:02:49.830> along<00:02:49.980> here<00:02:50.519> won't

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
there's three screws along here won't

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.559 
there's three screws along here won't
undo<00:02:51.690> them

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:57.989 

I<00:02:55.659> normally<00:02:56.530> have<00:02:56.709> separate<00:02:57.640> little<00:02:57.819> dishes

00:02:57.989 --> 00:02:57.999 
I normally have separate little dishes

00:02:57.999 --> 00:03:01.739 
I normally have separate little dishes
for<00:02:58.299> everything<00:02:58.719> but<00:02:59.760> just<00:03:00.760> I<00:03:01.030> just<00:03:01.299> kind<00:03:01.629> of

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:01.749 
for everything but just I just kind of

00:03:01.749 --> 00:03:03.410 
for everything but just I just kind of
decided<00:03:01.989> to<00:03:02.290> throw<00:03:02.409> this<00:03:02.590> video<00:03:02.889> together

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
decided to throw this video together

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.670 
decided to throw this video together
quickly<00:03:04.420> so<00:03:04.930> I'm<00:03:06.030> just<00:03:07.139> separating<00:03:08.139> them<00:03:08.290> just

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
quickly so I'm just separating them just

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.890 
quickly so I'm just separating them just
make<00:03:08.859> sure<00:03:09.040> you<00:03:09.159> know<00:03:09.249> they're<00:03:09.609> separated<00:03:10.329> now

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
make sure you know they're separated now

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.330 
make sure you know they're separated now
before<00:03:11.379> you<00:03:11.439> pull<00:03:11.620> this<00:03:11.709> out<00:03:11.889> you<00:03:12.159> need<00:03:12.310> to

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
before you pull this out you need to

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.129 
before you pull this out you need to
take<00:03:12.579> note<00:03:12.879> of<00:03:12.909> what's<00:03:13.359> going<00:03:13.569> on<00:03:13.659> here

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:14.139 
take note of what's going on here

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:17.550 
take note of what's going on here
this<00:03:14.849> stops<00:03:15.849> the<00:03:16.030> aperture<00:03:16.930> from<00:03:17.049> closing<00:03:17.439> too

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
this stops the aperture from closing too

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.129 
this stops the aperture from closing too
far<00:03:17.829> and<00:03:18.120> it<00:03:19.120> sits<00:03:19.329> on<00:03:19.540> the<00:03:20.530> left<00:03:20.739> side<00:03:21.010> of<00:03:21.310> this

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:22.139 
far and it sits on the left side of this

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:26.789 
far and it sits on the left side of this
spring-loaded<00:03:23.579> this<00:03:25.109> stopper<00:03:26.109> whatever<00:03:26.530> and

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
spring-loaded this stopper whatever and

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.179 
spring-loaded this stopper whatever and
then<00:03:27.370> you<00:03:27.730> also<00:03:28.120> have<00:03:28.500> what<00:03:29.500> we<00:03:29.620> did<00:03:29.769> undid

00:03:30.179 --> 00:03:30.189 
then you also have what we did undid

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:34.379 
then you also have what we did undid
earlier<00:03:30.519> the<00:03:31.319> what<00:03:32.319> closes<00:03:32.980> the<00:03:33.400> aperture<00:03:33.909> on

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:34.389 
earlier the what closes the aperture on

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:38.729 
earlier the what closes the aperture on
this<00:03:34.659> it's<00:03:35.169> on<00:03:35.379> the<00:03:35.560> right-hand<00:03:35.859> side<00:03:35.980> so<00:03:37.739> just

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
this it's on the right-hand side so just

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:39.420 
this it's on the right-hand side so just
take<00:03:38.919> note<00:03:38.949> of<00:03:39.129> that

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
take note of that

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.309 
take note of that
because<00:03:40.120> you<00:03:40.659> have<00:03:40.750> to<00:03:40.840> put<00:03:40.989> it<00:03:41.079> back<00:03:41.139> together

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:41.319 
because you have to put it back together

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:42.869 
because you have to put it back together
so<00:03:41.650> as<00:03:41.709> you<00:03:41.769> pull<00:03:41.949> this<00:03:42.040> out<00:03:42.219> the<00:03:42.459> spring<00:03:42.760> is

00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:42.879 
so as you pull this out the spring is

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:45.000 
so as you pull this out the spring is
going<00:03:43.000> to<00:03:43.090> eject<00:03:43.389> and<00:03:44.349> there<00:03:44.530> it<00:03:44.590> goes

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
going to eject and there it goes

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.709 
going to eject and there it goes
so<00:03:45.250> to<00:03:45.310> reset<00:03:45.969> that<00:03:46.150> when<00:03:46.329> you<00:03:46.419> put<00:03:46.599> it<00:03:46.689> back

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:46.719 
so to reset that when you put it back

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:50.909 
so to reset that when you put it back
together<00:03:47.280> just<00:03:48.280> spin<00:03:48.939> it<00:03:49.090> around<00:03:49.180> here<00:03:49.919> put

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:50.919 
together just spin it around here put

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:54.119 
together just spin it around here put
the<00:03:51.010> spring<00:03:51.340> on<00:03:51.489> there<00:03:51.909> and<00:03:52.650> you<00:03:53.650> would<00:03:53.829> hold

00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:54.129 
the spring on there and you would hold

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:58.559 
the spring on there and you would hold
it<00:03:54.280> like<00:03:54.489> so<00:03:56.519> I'd<00:03:57.519> hold<00:03:57.730> it<00:03:57.879> like<00:03:58.000> that<00:03:58.030> and<00:03:58.180> put

00:03:58.559 --> 00:03:58.569 
it like so I'd hold it like that and put

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:00.689 
it like so I'd hold it like that and put
it<00:03:58.599> back<00:03:58.780> in<00:03:59.049> on<00:03:59.290> the<00:03:59.889> right-hand<00:04:00.250> side<00:04:00.340> of

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:00.699 
it back in on the right-hand side of

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:04.050 
it back in on the right-hand side of
that<00:04:01.060> remember<00:04:01.689> that<00:04:02.019> silver<00:04:02.650> guy<00:04:02.769> there<00:04:03.060> but

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
that remember that silver guy there but

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.199 
that remember that silver guy there but
I'm<00:04:04.269> not<00:04:04.329> going<00:04:04.540> to<00:04:04.599> do<00:04:04.720> that<00:04:04.900> because<00:04:05.530> you<00:04:05.859> can

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
I'm not going to do that because you can

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:09.119 
I'm not going to do that because you can
rewind<00:04:07.209> a<00:04:07.329> video<00:04:07.540> and<00:04:07.689> see<00:04:07.810> how<00:04:07.840> it<00:04:08.049> goes<00:04:08.199> so

00:04:09.119 --> 00:04:09.129 
rewind a video and see how it goes so

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:12.629 
rewind a video and see how it goes so
then<00:04:09.280> you<00:04:09.519> pull<00:04:09.759> this<00:04:10.030> up<00:04:10.269> and<00:04:10.780> out<00:04:11.609> make<00:04:12.609> sure

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:12.639 
then you pull this up and out make sure

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:14.520 
then you pull this up and out make sure
you<00:04:12.879> know<00:04:13.090> what<00:04:13.419> side<00:04:13.689> don't<00:04:14.079> flip<00:04:14.349> it<00:04:14.470> around

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
you know what side don't flip it around

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.300 
you know what side don't flip it around
goes<00:04:15.129> this<00:04:15.310> way<00:04:16.709> you'll<00:04:17.709> want<00:04:17.889> to<00:04:17.949> put<00:04:18.099> it<00:04:18.190> back

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
goes this way you'll want to put it back

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:19.199 
goes this way you'll want to put it back
the<00:04:18.489> same<00:04:18.699> way

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
the same way

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:25.580 
the same way
then<00:04:19.659> now<00:04:19.930> this<00:04:20.199> guy<00:04:20.380> will<00:04:20.590> pull<00:04:20.979> out

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.770 

and<00:04:25.680> you'll<00:04:26.340> want<00:04:26.520> to<00:04:26.610> clean<00:04:26.820> this<00:04:27.090> and<00:04:27.389> the

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
and you'll want to clean this and the

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.310 
and you'll want to clean this and the
aperture<00:04:28.200> blades<00:04:28.380> with<00:04:28.860> alcohol<00:04:29.550> I<00:04:30.290> use<00:04:31.290> a

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
aperture blades with alcohol I use a

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.879 
aperture blades with alcohol I use a
q-tip<00:04:32.510> very<00:04:33.510> gently<00:04:33.810> alcohol<00:04:34.200> is<00:04:34.350> super<00:04:34.680> safe

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:34.889 
q-tip very gently alcohol is super safe

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:37.310 
q-tip very gently alcohol is super safe
it's<00:04:35.280> very<00:04:35.669> gentle<00:04:36.000> but<00:04:36.480> it<00:04:36.630> still<00:04:36.840> gets<00:04:37.080> rid

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
it's very gentle but it still gets rid

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.460 
it's very gentle but it still gets rid
of<00:04:37.380> the<00:04:37.470> oil<00:04:37.680> it's<00:04:38.040> very<00:04:38.100> good<00:04:39.020> now<00:04:40.020> to<00:04:40.200> get<00:04:40.380> the

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
of the oil it's very good now to get the

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.230 
of the oil it's very good now to get the
aperture<00:04:40.860> out<00:04:41.010> you<00:04:41.370> want<00:04:41.550> to<00:04:41.610> be<00:04:41.669> very<00:04:41.700> careful

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
aperture out you want to be very careful

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.450 
aperture out you want to be very careful
you<00:04:42.270> don't<00:04:42.480> want<00:04:42.570> to<00:04:42.750> bend<00:04:42.930> these<00:04:43.110> don't<00:04:44.010> gouge

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
you don't want to bend these don't gouge

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.520 
you don't want to bend these don't gouge
them<00:04:44.760> with<00:04:44.850> the<00:04:44.940> tool<00:04:45.150> or<00:04:45.360> anything<00:04:45.750> try<00:04:46.380> and

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
them with the tool or anything try and

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.670 
them with the tool or anything try and
just<00:04:46.880> bump<00:04:47.880> them<00:04:48.150> out<00:04:48.240> and<00:04:48.480> try<00:04:49.230> not<00:04:49.350> to<00:04:49.500> touch

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
just bump them out and try not to touch

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.260 
just bump them out and try not to touch
the<00:04:49.919> element<00:04:50.720> there<00:04:51.720> they<00:04:51.840> go<00:04:52.880> one<00:04:53.880> more<00:04:54.060> there

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
the element there they go one more there
