00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.039
 ladies, I will not tolerate this 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.260
 kind of behavior 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.300
 monster high is a school that advocates 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.840
 acceptance understanding and the 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.000
 tolerance 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.440
 also to help you acquire his 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.879
 essential qualities 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.830
 you will have to go through all 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.540
 days together everything is possible 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.129
 from now on you will be bound by these 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.510
 magic bracelets you have to stay at 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.180
 less than a meter from each other 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.340
 until 3 pm by then you will pass 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.960
 every second together I think that 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.920
 you will learn many things very 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.140
 precious here more than a meter separates us 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:01.500
 this will be heading the stubborn corridor of 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.780
 eternal homework and payments 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.030
 inflamed will visit your families 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.539
 but it's nothing next to the corridor of 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.729
 eternal must hockey be stuck with 

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:13.590
 you it's not the ideal situation but 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.030
 so much to enjoy then tell me 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.710
 why did you start sending me a 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.330
 snowball I do not understand and 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.580
 yet I am understanding if my 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.710
 trick understanding I have trouble 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.750
 understand this flanked behaves of 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.030
 quite nice way but in this case 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.860
 why do you have the moment 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.539
 started the snowball fight 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.920
 I understand you do not want me 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:33.690
 to say we 'll see that later 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.240
 so where do you come from the summits of 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.970
 the himalaya ah yes and which augis little 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.300
 it's important to not only know 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.310
 see any package is very pretty listen this 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.660
 chatter is totally useless 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.250
 I have the impression that here people 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.780
 talk too much to say nothing 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.520
 sometimes it's better to stay 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.860
 silent then was rude 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.780
 but I'm not badly polite I him 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.520
 lets keep your breath it's very 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.149
 confusing people who do not like me that 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.770
 starts well 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.899

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.220

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.520

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.900

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.290

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.120
 we drink water in the mountains 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.030
