00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 well let's see how 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.600
 make this plane really super 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:10.260
 fast we see it from below we produce from 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:14.160
 above we want to open is a plane indeed 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:17.460
 really fast off the prototypes and let's go 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:22.980
 to do ours with a4 sheets that will go 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:28.050
 all folded in half for the side 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.880
 long we have and we trace the 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.719
 girl let's go first 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.030
 little triangle you take here you take it here 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:38.250
 from the inside to the outside 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.050
 ok traced the line of the first 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.829
 triangle you go to do the same 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.620
 same thing on the other side 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:51.180
 coincides below coincides above is the case 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:53.699
 to draw the line drawn well the 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:58.649
 line of the second triangle we go to 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:02.930
 make even more acute triangles e 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:07.320
 the tip coincides below coincides 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:11.750
 everything coincides, we go on like this 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.750
 let's go nice tip 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:24.290
 let's kill below let's go to 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:30.310
 trace the point well at this point 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:30.310
 will go here going by here 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:40.399
 let's take this little corner like that 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:42.560
 and we are going to create again what 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:46.549
 will be the real tip of our plane 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.140
 while all share the same well-defined 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:50.740
 what is going to happen even from 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.740
 this other part 

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:04.700
 we turn our nay plane before 

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:12.200
 still we take this is we pull it up 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:15.319
 to the end there is so much paper all over 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.660
 dedicated will be nice appreciated a 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:23.260
 point out that this is a super super plane 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:26.269
 fast is a real fast and very good 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:29.000
 we give you what will be ours 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:31.970
 ala let's do the same thing too 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.570
 on the other side there is a lot of paper then 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.940
 a nice pressure here and we go to 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:40.970
 still take good that there is a nice one 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:44.510
 our plane and we did ours 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:47.380
 really super fast plane we go 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:53.560
 immediately to do the flight test 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:53.560
 here we are flying drool 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.020
 this has been favored
