00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:05.930
 luis carlos burgos of the company cara manzur was having breakfast in a motel 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:07.919
 in the fortune of San Carlos 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.230
 and he started to see this unusual flash on the top of the sandy volcano 

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:16.029
 efe 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:19.909
 It arises from the desire hoteliers that must be done is that there be third but it was 

00:00:19.909 --> 00:00:23.699
 captured the previous Monday by this worker of a transport company 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.009
 tourist at about 8 and 35 in the morning 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:33.510
 the image drawn in a digital laboratory clearly shows a circle 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.510
 because it is the flash that was in the city since smoking 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.230
 and adds that the volcano 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.410
 in that frame the poster of a very bright intense 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.410
 in that moment I remembered that I had my camera in in the room 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.610
 and pirate in the quickly and I started filming in 2011 where we 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.940
 we were very curious about the intensity of the brightness they had 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.050
 but what scientists say 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.560
 raúl mora volcanologist jáled meshal before costa rica will start this lived 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.130
 in the power of news 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.130
 and concluded that possibly people have raised that 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.750
 day to the crater of the massif which is prohibited 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.620
 it did not start from zero a light or a reflection caused by a person 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.300
 peron not 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.579
 I think that this 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:39.009
 from the area or collective to the volcano that by the way this was a cover 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:40.160
 tranquility 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.830
 in recent weeks has given no training and it is very possible that tourists 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.140
 and some days 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.240
 up to a point and responsible is entering the park 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.009
 It is clear that since 2001 there is a restriction on the use of land 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.380
 in the sandy area 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.680
 we have information that there are always people who go up 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.270
 then it is very possible that people who in their day enrich from above 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.100
 they are doing some signal with a mirror 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.869
 and that is that today they go up to the sand crater they could find 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.869
 dangers like these 

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:19.359
 It is important to clarify that although the volcano is in a stage 

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:21.389
 relatively calm 

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:26.049
 the walls of the sandy volcano are very unstable then in their simple text 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:29.399
 that landslides and landslides occur even if the volcano is not 

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:33.979
 and erupting at this time then the walls already of themselves 

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:37.439
 this rocky massif are unstable the landslides are going to continue 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:42.379
 observing as in previous years that of yasky as it transpired in the area 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:46.149
 of fortune there are days that organize clandestine excursions 

00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:49.629
 the crater of the volcano for which they charge hundreds of dollars 

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:54.939
 For now, the video will be sent to the park rangers for their 

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:55.089
 analysis
