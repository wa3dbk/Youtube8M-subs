00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.840
 a piece of nougat thanks to de cra and 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:17.060
 I come to present a specific 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.160
 super recipe for dog biscuits 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:22.040
 much healthier than that piece of 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.470
 nougat this recipe has been supervised 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:27.700
 by experts in veterinary nutrition and 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:30.820
 now going let's start 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:33.040
 200 grams of wheat flour 50 grams 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.010
 of corn flour half a teaspoon of 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.800
 salt bad type 100 milliliters of broth 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.710
 chicken low in salt and if you do it at home 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.630
 do not put him at 75 grams of 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.989
 butter without salt at temperature 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.989
 ambient 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.380
 We put all the ingredients in a 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:56.090
 container and mix well with the 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.090
 fingers until a homogeneous mass is obtained 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.370
 We had a good time with your hands up 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.590
 get a fine texture those that 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:11.170
 have thermomix at home you can do 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.630
 the mass programming the one minute to 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.300
 speed 4 and now we make a ball with 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.510
 the mass is wrapped in plastic film 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.970
 that does not dry out 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.270
 and let it sit for 30 minutes in the 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.270
 fridge 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.650
 then we stretch the dough with the 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.390
 help of a roller between two sheets of 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.610
 baking paper so that it does not stick 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.720
 until getting a thickness of 3 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.180
 millimeters 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.130
 remember that this is a prize if your 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.890
 dog is small uses a cortapastas 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.980
 small and give him one or two cookies a day 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.990
 If your dog is medium sized 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.610
 we will use a medium and 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.240
 we can also give one or two 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.240
 cookies a day 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.810
 we mark the dough with the short pasta and 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.860
 this surplus we stretch again for 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.860
 make many more cookies 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.160
 the cookies that we will obtain with this 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.470
 recipe have to last between 10 and 20 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.110
 days according to the size of the dog the 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.090
 time to bake our cookies 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.190
 We preheat the oven to 180 degrees and 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.260
 we put them at half height for about 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.760
 12 14 minutes until they are well 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.189
 golden 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.439
 we take out the tray carefully and when 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:30.909
 the cookies are cold we keep them 

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:34.200
 in an airtight canister so that it 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:34.200
 keep crispy 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.640
 you have seen how easy this is the recipe 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.130
 specific Christmas cookies for 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.010
 your dog and remember that it's just a 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.330
 reward respect the amounts we have 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.490
 said earlier 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.330
 We hope you have a happy Christmas and 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.330
