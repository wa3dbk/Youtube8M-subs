nothing<00:01:48.990> more<00:01:49.140> than<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:49.350> chemical<00:01:49.799> reaction

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
nothing more than a chemical reaction

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.999 
nothing more than a chemical reaction
and<00:01:50.520> plus<00:01:51.180> people<00:01:51.270> have<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.780> understand<00:01:52.350> when

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
and plus people have to understand when

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.670 
and plus people have to understand when
you<00:01:53.280> are<00:01:53.630> compressing<00:01:54.630> snow<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:55.649> are

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
you are compressing snow you are

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.280 
you are compressing snow you are
literally<00:01:56.250> changing<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.729> molecules<00:01:57.360> because

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
literally changing the molecules because

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.130 
literally changing the molecules because
like<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:58.740> couple<00:01:59.250> of<00:01:59.310> people<00:01:59.460> have<00:01:59.790> said<00:02:00.140> snow

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
like a couple of people have said snow

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.870 
like a couple of people have said snow
is<00:02:01.439> basically<00:02:01.860> ten<00:02:02.100> percent<00:02:02.430> water<00:02:02.670> and

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
is basically ten percent water and

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.569 
is basically ten percent water and
ninety<00:02:03.420> percent<00:02:03.450> air<00:02:03.960> so<00:02:04.619> if<00:02:04.770> you<00:02:04.860> compress<00:02:05.369> it

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
ninety percent air so if you compress it

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.039 
ninety percent air so if you compress it
you're<00:02:05.790> basically<00:02:05.909> squeezing<00:02:06.570> out<00:02:06.689> all<00:02:06.719> the

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
you're basically squeezing out all the

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.040 
you're basically squeezing out all the
air<00:02:07.229> turning<00:02:07.770> it<00:02:07.920> more<00:02:08.250> into<00:02:08.610> a<00:02:08.640> solid<00:02:09.270> solids

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
air turning it more into a solid solids

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.080 
air turning it more into a solid solids
are<00:02:10.170> going<00:02:10.379> to<00:02:10.500> take<00:02:10.739> longer<00:02:11.129> to<00:02:11.459> end<00:02:11.700> up

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.410 
I'm not saying the government doesn't
and<00:02:22.200> can't<00:02:22.620> do<00:02:22.830> these<00:02:23.010> things<00:02:23.370> but<00:02:24.030> we<00:02:24.150> have<00:02:24.330> to

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
and can't do these things but we have to

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.570 
and can't do these things but we have to
be<00:02:24.540> very<00:02:24.780> careful<00:02:25.230> with<00:02:25.409> the<00:02:25.830> way<00:02:25.980> we<00:02:26.190> do<00:02:26.400> it

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
be very careful with the way we do it

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.759 
be very careful with the way we do it
because<00:02:27.390> if<00:02:27.629> we're<00:02:27.900> just<00:02:28.049> doing<00:02:28.260> it<00:02:28.530> to<00:02:28.560> get

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
because if we're just doing it to get

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.009 
because if we're just doing it to get
views<00:02:29.190> and<00:02:29.489> not<00:02:30.000> really<00:02:30.360> realizing<00:02:30.780> what

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
views and not really realizing what

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.789 
views and not really realizing what
you're<00:02:31.470> doing<00:02:31.860> you're<00:02:32.730> giving<00:02:33.420> this

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799 
you're doing you're giving this

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.619 
that's not what we want so again this is
all<00:02:40.110> about<00:02:40.319> the<00:02:40.650> fact<00:02:40.890> of<00:02:41.190> just<00:02:41.730> knowing

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
all about the fact of just knowing

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.020 
all about the fact of just knowing
science<00:02:43.110> and<00:02:43.349> understanding<00:02:44.310> it's<00:02:44.549> just<00:02:44.879> the

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
science and understanding it's just the

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.619 
science and understanding it's just the
transfer<00:02:46.609> look<00:02:47.609> at<00:02:47.730> all<00:02:47.819> of<00:02:47.849> the<00:02:47.970> look<00:02:48.390> at<00:02:48.510> all

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:48.629 
transfer look at all of the look at all

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:53.390 
transfer look at all of the look at all
the<00:02:48.720> black<00:02:50.780> it's<00:02:51.780> just<00:02:52.049> the<00:02:52.140> transfer<00:02:52.680> from

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
the black it's just the transfer from

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.259 
the black it's just the transfer from
the<00:02:55.190> there<00:02:56.190> we<00:02:56.280> go<00:02:56.370> I'm<00:02:56.579> gonna<00:02:56.700> set<00:02:56.879> myself<00:02:57.030> on

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
the there we go I'm gonna set myself on

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:58.399 
the there we go I'm gonna set myself on
fire<00:02:57.329> that<00:02:57.510> would<00:02:57.810> have<00:02:57.900> been<00:02:57.989> say<00:02:58.140> good

00:02:58.399 --> 00:02:58.409 
fire that would have been say good

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:00.860 
fire that would have been say good
experiment<00:02:58.890> right<00:02:59.010> there<00:02:59.269> it's<00:03:00.269> just<00:03:00.629> showing

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
experiment right there it's just showing

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.020 
experiment right there it's just showing
the<00:03:01.200> difference<00:03:01.620> between<00:03:02.220> knowing<00:03:02.909> what

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
the difference between knowing what

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.000 
the difference between knowing what
you're<00:03:03.150> doing<00:03:03.180> and<00:03:03.599> just<00:03:03.810> seeing<00:03:04.709> something

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
you're doing and just seeing something

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.339 
you're doing and just seeing something
and<00:03:05.310> you<00:03:06.209> know<00:03:06.329> like<00:03:06.510> I<00:03:06.659> say<00:03:06.810> just<00:03:06.840> because<00:03:07.230> you

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:07.349 
and you know like I say just because you

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:09.410 
and you know like I say just because you
see<00:03:07.560> something<00:03:07.829> doesn't<00:03:08.280> mean<00:03:08.519> it's<00:03:08.849> what<00:03:09.269> you

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
see something doesn't mean it's what you

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.949 
see something doesn't mean it's what you
think<00:03:09.599> it<00:03:09.780> is

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
think it is

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:11.720 
think it is
I<00:03:10.200> mean<00:03:10.440> magicians<00:03:11.099> are<00:03:11.250> counting<00:03:11.579> on<00:03:11.700> that

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
I mean magicians are counting on that

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.420 
I mean magicians are counting on that
now<00:03:12.480> again<00:03:13.109> I'm<00:03:13.379> not<00:03:13.409> suggesting<00:03:13.769> there<00:03:14.280> are

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
now again I'm not suggesting there are

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.280 
now again I'm not suggesting there are
people<00:03:14.700> purposely<00:03:14.940> lying<00:03:15.359> but<00:03:15.870> if<00:03:16.019> you<00:03:16.109> don't
