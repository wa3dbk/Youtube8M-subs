00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:46.450 
on stake so my predictions are for this

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:50.910 
on stake so my predictions are for this
match<00:04:46.690> will<00:04:47.440> be<00:04:47.850> 60<00:04:48.850> 40<00:04:49.210> 60<00:04:49.480> for<00:04:49.840> India<00:04:50.170> and<00:04:50.380> 40

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:50.920 
match will be 60 40 60 for India and 40

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.180 
match will be 60 40 60 for India and 40
for<00:04:51.070> Pakistan<00:04:51.460> because<00:04:51.820> India<00:04:52.510> is<00:04:52.920> at<00:04:53.920> this

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
for Pakistan because India is at this

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.360 
for Pakistan because India is at this
point<00:04:54.520> it's<00:04:55.060> in<00:04:55.660> a<00:04:55.780> very<00:04:56.170> very<00:04:56.680> good<00:04:57.010> form

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
point it's in a very very good form

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.210 
point it's in a very very good form
every<00:04:58.330> best<00:04:58.600> man<00:04:58.870> is<00:04:59.110> in<00:04:59.350> a<00:04:59.440> very<00:04:59.650> good<00:04:59.890> form

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
every best man is in a very good form

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.340 
every best man is in a very good form
and<00:05:00.370> a<00:05:00.550> bowling<00:05:00.970> attack<00:05:01.090> is<00:05:01.390> very<00:05:01.660> good<00:05:02.230> as

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:02.350 
and a bowling attack is very good as

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:05.040 
and a bowling attack is very good as
well<00:05:02.380> and<00:05:02.770> on<00:05:03.610> the<00:05:03.790> other<00:05:03.910> side<00:05:04.030> Pakistan<00:05:04.810> is

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
well and on the other side Pakistan is

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.530 
well and on the other side Pakistan is
the<00:05:05.310> they<00:05:06.310> were<00:05:06.370> not<00:05:06.730> good<00:05:07.060> and<00:05:07.240> they<00:05:07.510> are

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:07.540 
the they were not good and they are

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.510 
the they were not good and they are
still<00:05:07.870> I<00:05:08.080> guess<00:05:08.260> they<00:05:08.410> are<00:05:08.440> still<00:05:08.680> not<00:05:08.710> good<00:05:09.160> in

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
still I guess they are still not good in

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.010 
still I guess they are still not good in
this<00:05:10.330> tournament<00:05:10.660> so<00:05:10.960> I<00:05:11.230> guess<00:05:11.860> it<00:05:12.490> will<00:05:12.730> be

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
this tournament so I guess it will be

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.190 
this tournament so I guess it will be
6040

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:14.200 
6040

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.290 
6040
I<00:05:14.230> guess<00:05:14.470> 60%<00:05:15.040> chance<00:05:15.220> India<00:05:15.790> will<00:05:15.940> win<00:05:15.970> and

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 
I guess 60% chance India will win and

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:21.120 
I guess 60% chance India will win and
40%<00:05:16.660> chance<00:05:17.550> Pakistan<00:05:18.550> will<00:05:18.760> win<00:05:18.790> and<00:05:19.800> so<00:05:20.800> you

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.130 
40% chance Pakistan will win and so you

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:23.160 
40% chance Pakistan will win and so you
guys<00:05:21.310> should<00:05:21.370> decide<00:05:21.970> and<00:05:22.240> write<00:05:22.930> in<00:05:23.080> the

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:23.170 
guys should decide and write in the

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:28.050 
guys should decide and write in the
comment<00:05:23.500> what<00:05:23.650> you<00:05:23.800> guys<00:05:24.220> think<00:05:24.550> so<00:05:24.870> peace<00:05:25.870> out
