00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.049
 well let's analyze them together 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.870
 sustained as are the fishermen the 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.289
 fishermen take us something like that say a 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:13.289
 huge thing that hit a few jumps of 

00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:16.289
 250 kilos but here are images and this 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:19.520
 is what caught one pea pablo 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:23.350
 young fisherman 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.350
 but not that you take the same 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:34.340
 the naval base will be the whale 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.340
 and there appears papal 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:43.840
 to build 40 kilos 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:51.260
 of 40 kilos pablo de santis a has already 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:53.600
 has countless roads in the rivers 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.120
 of the Argentine coast 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:00.199
 but you saw how he brought it and brought it 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:02.089
 half dead does not move and half weird 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:05.449
 this surubí of 40 kilos is like 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:08.530
 delivered and that said the fisherman fabbro 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.530
 distant the following 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.490
 of all 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.380
 this is the prize 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.630
 this is the prize everything we do 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.630
 to be here 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:25.840
 miranda we are talking 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:31.000
 something of 40 kilos a climb to the river of the 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:33.360
 40 kilos and hold my heart five days 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.360
 my life 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.550
 I am moved by the power I remember 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:45.440
 my old man thank you for making me the fisherman 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.440
 do not look what I know 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:52.340
 and what we do with this know 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:54.920
 what we do with this we have 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.930
 what to return look what is this 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.360
 wonder 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.080
 because we do not start to value a little bit 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.080
 what we have 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:08.090
 we take a sin is perfect 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:10.310
 as a sin 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.489
 but we can not notice a saying this but 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.489
 What is it 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:20.410
 well very well I left ecology is 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:24.490
 Pablo Vicente is fine is fine what 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:27.520
 is saying he I agree with him if 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:29.560
 the fishermen do not return it 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.590
 attempting against nature now 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.180
 this is a lazy piola because it says this 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.490
 you have to return it back but it 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.250
 had a long time that is to say that already 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.700
 returns we have been very good but 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.560
 if it takes so long, poor animal dies 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.300
 excited but it's fine I do not know I 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.940
 the one who visited is saying it can not be 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:51.030
 it's trout just to me what I think is 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.490
 this is real 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.610
 we congratulate pablo distant but 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:59.130
 there are several things that happened that 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.020
 they attract attention and in 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.390
 we would have to say that if it is 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:06.319
 a joke is an excellent joke achieved 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.319
 by Pablo distance 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:13.140
 comes as half delivered that animal 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:16.620
 I was in the middle weird, well there it was 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:19.650
 when when the long is supposed 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.269
 it's not the time the plague is like 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.510
 delivered the animal 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:26.370
 there are many gray hair congratulations to Pablo 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.799
 distant and achieved what clear that all 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:34.220
 the fishermen want to fish a 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:34.220
 surubí of 40 kilos a giant
