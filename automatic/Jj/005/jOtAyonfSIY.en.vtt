00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.630
 hello everyone I'm plinio vg and today I 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:19.100
 I bring the review of a monk called 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.230
 equivalent to let's start 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:24.860
 the first object that we have to see is 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:27.190
 the inert stone that is created from this 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.190
 way 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.740
 we took all and fused it directly 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:40.270
 it's a very simple rushing the truth 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.390
 inert stone 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:48.520
 this stone alone does not have any 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:51.699
 effect does not do anything but surrounding the 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:57.100
 fragments of mini 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:57.100
 we get with a very original name 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:05.170
 mime stone 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:08.490
 we already have a cesarean section 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.490
 the stone of me 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:16.530
 this object is going to change block 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.580
 from its original form that are here to 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.830
 others if you see below and a little circle 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.390
 surrounding 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.780
 we go to the right and a little circle 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:29.770
 surrounding an object with which we can 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.770
 change these objects 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:35.450
 have it on land we can put it in 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:37.520
 stone or we can put it on grass 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.219
 green this with these objects because if 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.319
 for example we look here we see that 

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:46.600
 we can change more things to 

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:46.600
 dealing with different notes 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.310
 is 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.230
 as you can see then the berries are not 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.440
 berries and objects that are not yet 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:59.320
 they have nothing but their main utility 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:02.980
 could this be 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:06.460
 coming to us the kraft wick eo 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:09.160
 and filling everything for example iron 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.560
 we received one gold 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.680
 and as you can see it is being spent if we put 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.020
 four gold we get a diamond 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.850
 this is very good to not have to 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.520
 spend hours and hours in the mine 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:24.370
 itching the fragments of me I do not know 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:27.170
 they get killing monsters any 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:30.410
 class of monsters 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:33.460
 so it's going very well 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:36.400
 look one has fallen 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:38.110
 Well I hope you liked the 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.720
 review the mount is in development 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.580
 by updating it I will go up 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.340
 new reviews 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.880
 give you the chance to subscribe and until the 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.880
 next video
