00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:06.070
 Look 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.360
 stay comfortably 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.110
 do not 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.000
 yes 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.250
 and 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:13.620
 We have been such good guests that we have not 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:16.020
 be invited the coffee and the old ones 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.380
 the hotel has cost us a little bit the 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.380
 history 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.090
 listening to life 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:31.650
 and 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.650
 rather she 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:44.340
 we see each other beautiful love there 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:57.240
 I get involved is a word that I say all the 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:02:00.630
 life without selling words that is silly 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.030
 likes to play dumb if you always 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.049
 invent words that if I do not feel 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.049
 bad rest the mortals 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.450
 Since we've known each other, it's always been 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:16.980
 invented with the time 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:19.860
 my love always finished with every thing 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.450
 that I stayed and there were times I did 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.310
 think that I now ounces that I do not 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.700
 I really knew in the existence of that 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.700
 word 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.299
 the word game 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.370
 who understands words that seek me 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:42.830
 I felt like it 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:45.069
 in a word two there are there there are words 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:48.400
 that the people 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:53.099
 discover for the first time not by second 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.099
 once they discover the first time 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:01.380
 no longer talk 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:05.700
 my present discounted well paired 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:08.580
 there are words that I have just heard 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:12.590
 for example and I looked for them in the 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.590
 dictionary if there is more 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:21.880
 of guilt only one person is 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.290
 realized and put it in the video to see 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.970
 who has only one person has 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.140
 put on the video that more people are 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.240
 have realized I do not know because 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.430
 they could have realized but not what 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:33.140
 have put a broad will have started that 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:36.960
 have you speak badly 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.710
 that sense of contact 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:42.790
 can be 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:46.540
 in short is the one that is being fixed by 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:49.160
 the road is taking boogers for 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.730
 be able to breathe well 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:54.560
 everything dry from the flu 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:58.000
 over grabbed and grabbed as a pretext 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.000
 the blow to clean his hand 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.989
 he is a pig 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:13.560
