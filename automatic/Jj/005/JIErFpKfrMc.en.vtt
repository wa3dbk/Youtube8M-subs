 good beer whenever there is a 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.530
 moderate consumption is that it is rich in

 cholesterol levels what is good 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.000
 for the heart and more the bad thing is that the 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.670
 beer has alcohol we already talked about that 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.609
 causes diseases but also per gram 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.470
 contributes 7 calories but empty because no 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.880
 provide nutrients and if you add the 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.570
 calories from the carbohydrates that 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.550
 they contain 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.370
 the cereals with which the 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.860
 result is the tummy bag that is the 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:16.020
 beer if it gets fat and exceeds its consumption and

 elected at 110 calories equivalent to 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.340
 eating a banana budweiser has 145 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.600
 calories the same contribution of a cup of
