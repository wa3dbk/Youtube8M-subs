00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:07.710
 Hello viewers of our channel on 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:11.790
 youtube and site visitor fish form 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:15.299
 Kiev today I want to tell you how 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:19.710
 equip foam fish that can 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:22.830
 make our forms and showed 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:27.390
 previous hook video 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:29.369
 so I want to note as a rule with 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.679
 fish dips use two types 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:39.420
 Circles are hooks 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:40.430
 and hooks tees doubles to 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.640
 to insert 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:51.500
 I want a double, we will need it myself 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:51.500
 foam fish heat source and shiva 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:58.609
 we start up the awl 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:14.540
 and by the size of the hook live holes 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:25.320
 can be installed in two ways 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:31.189
 usually due to this somewhere 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:37.080
 you catch this mounting hook gives us 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:39.149
 more like serif and hook 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:45.659
 you can hide like this 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:50.039
 get not clinging straight holes 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:52.940
 we are ready to we crochet 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:52.940
 fish 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:01.729
 we pass it and drag it like this 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.729
 way a bunch 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:15.520
 here we have a double hook inserted and 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:24.550
 paragon and smile now i want you 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:27.269
 show offset hook mounting 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:32.709
 foam fish mounted 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:36.340
 vertical mounting i'm all tops 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:38.250
 hooks for a couple well, there is a small fish 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:42.450
 difference 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:47.940
 express yourself well in that fish is mounted 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:52.000
 god to even better 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:55.680
 animate the bait just like 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:04.049
 when mounting silicone, we pierce 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:04.049
 first we stretch the fish itself 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:24.359
 and then we mount it this way 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:28.780
 there are essentially we do 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:32.939
 non-sticking and posting bait 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:39.120
 your work is not like this 

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:39.120
 imitates a sick fish thanks
