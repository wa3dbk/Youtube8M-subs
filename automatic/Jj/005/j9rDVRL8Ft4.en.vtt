 name is mario and starting this new 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.030
 stage with a new new logo 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.620
 structure for what is the channel 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.809
 we started with a very application 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.109
 fun and above all very very very 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:19.289
 complete is called tiny three property 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:22.199
 special ops really is a very series 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.840
 good because nothing else is to go killing 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.510
 You are going to build what is uniform 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.550
 you're building weapons you're getting 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.990
 several sacrifices and at the same time more 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.059
 getting medals that allow you 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.610
 unlock other armies and thus be able to 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.320
 destroy the enemies in this case the 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.390
 left side where top shopping is 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.489
 come some tips for you 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.260
 can download directly and do it 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.000
 a little faster I recommend that 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.079
 make the story really doing the 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.570
 story little by little they will go 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.250
 unwrapping the application and over 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.690
 everything that the game is very entertaining what 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.449
 you can play for devices like a 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.180
 ipad or an iphone or ipod touch has a 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.460
 cost of 39 pesos what they are in this 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.469
 case three dollars but really the 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.879
 application is very very good good that 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.199
 start the game you will say what you are going 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.060
 to have ten thousand points for you 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.340
 You can add your command 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.320
 adding a good report if we are going to 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.729
 give you following here come several 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.890
 objectives the advantage is that it is in 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.610
 Spanish you have 10,000 points we are going to 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.610
 give him next 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.420
 and the game is very simple is through 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.770
 of your finger handling the touch you are going 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.590
 to say the location and who goes 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.090
 kill or whoever is attacking for example 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.520
 here the tutorial is telling you how 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:32.020
 you have to move and I did it like that 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.020
 that I can move to where I'm going 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:39.180
 x point the enemy with the tows for 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:39.180
 let him start shooting 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.409
 perfect we come back 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.300
 in that case it is said that it is also 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.680
 making a movement 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.650
 I liked it 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.020
 and we are moving forward and I have a profit 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.710
 I'm going to the left side to get in 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.870
 this case the bazooka we will give buy 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.300
 he came back quickly here he is 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.649
 as he has it and he selected the garbage that 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.190
 is on the right side and pulled him towards 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:14.510
 the cannon to shoot 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.510
 we have advance 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.960
 really the graphics are very good 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.260
 you can go to see how it goes 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.260
 to stay 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.990
 we select the compass in this case 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.030
 it tells us enemy vehicles marks a 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.120
 very complete map so that you do not 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.720
 we can develop we are moving forward 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.720
 let's leave it 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:40.019
 and really the missions are very good 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:42.630
 and we are going to finish the mission we are going to 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:44.160
