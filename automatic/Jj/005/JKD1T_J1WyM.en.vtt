next<00:01:53.799> set<00:01:54.130> of<00:01:54.340> tools<00:01:54.700> i<00:01:55.030> mentioned<00:01:55.810> the<00:01:55.869> last

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
next set of tools i mentioned the last

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.210 
next set of tools i mentioned the last
tutorial<00:01:56.880> hitting<00:01:57.880> ctrl<00:01:58.390> and<00:01:59.220> right-clicking

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
tutorial hitting ctrl and right-clicking

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.520 
tutorial hitting ctrl and right-clicking
I<00:02:00.549> think<00:02:00.789> I<00:02:00.850> said<00:02:00.909> bright<00:02:01.630> key<00:02:02.020> at<00:02:02.170> one<00:02:02.320> point

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
I think I said bright key at one point

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.050 
I think I said bright key at one point
but<00:02:02.710> right-clicking<00:02:03.220> and<00:02:03.430> you<00:02:03.580> can<00:02:03.729> split

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
but right-clicking and you can split

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.499 
but right-clicking and you can split
items<00:02:05.729> some<00:02:06.729> of<00:02:06.850> you<00:02:06.970> might<00:02:07.119> ask<00:02:07.330> yourself

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
items some of you might ask yourself

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.910 
correctly the first time my preferred
correct<00:03:35.940> way<00:03:36.180> of<00:03:36.209> doing<00:03:36.659> this<00:03:36.690> is<00:03:37.019> a<00:03:37.620> little

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
correct way of doing this is a little

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.949 
correct way of doing this is a little
bit<00:03:38.040> off<00:03:38.159> the<00:03:38.310> charts<00:03:38.670> and<00:03:38.909> it<00:03:39.629> takes<00:03:39.810> a<00:03:39.870> little

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
bit off the charts and it takes a little

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.380 
bit off the charts and it takes a little
bit<00:03:40.079> more<00:03:40.230> time<00:03:40.440> to<00:03:40.470> set<00:03:40.859> up<00:03:41.269> but<00:03:42.269> it's

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
bit more time to set up but it's

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.589 
bit more time to set up but it's
actually<00:03:42.629> going<00:03:42.780> to<00:03:42.870> give<00:03:42.959> you<00:03:43.049> a<00:03:43.109> much<00:03:43.409> better

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:44.599 
actually going to give you a much better

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:47.390 
actually going to give you a much better
triangulated<00:03:45.599> surface<00:03:46.200> than<00:03:46.470> than<00:03:47.069> if<00:03:47.250> you

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
triangulated surface than than if you

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.240 
triangulated surface than than if you
were<00:03:47.549> to<00:03:47.730> subtract<00:03:48.450> it<00:03:48.629> out<00:03:48.829> you<00:03:49.829> see<00:03:50.010> what<00:03:50.159> i'm

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
were to subtract it out you see what i'm

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.460 
were to subtract it out you see what i'm
doing<00:03:50.280> here<00:03:50.730> is<00:03:50.790> i'm<00:03:51.030> using<00:03:51.810> the<00:03:51.900> edge<00:03:52.019> tool<00:03:52.349> by

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
doing here is i'm using the edge tool by

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.819 
doing here is i'm using the edge tool by
hitting<00:03:52.709> the<00:03:52.799> e<00:03:52.829> key<00:03:53.370> and<00:03:54.530> putting<00:03:55.530> in<00:03:55.650> those

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
hitting the e key and putting in those

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:57.890 
hitting the e key and putting in those
blue<00:03:56.099> dots<00:03:56.129> there<00:03:56.639> and<00:03:56.849> actually<00:03:57.329> moving

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
blue dots there and actually moving

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.539 
blue dots there and actually moving
these<00:03:58.290> to<00:03:58.530> where<00:03:58.709> they<00:03:58.889> actually<00:03:59.040> line<00:03:59.519> up

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
these to where they actually line up

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:02.149 
these to where they actually line up
perfectly<00:04:00.139> the<00:04:01.139> reasons<00:04:01.440> why<00:04:01.590> I<00:04:01.620> do<00:04:01.739> that<00:04:01.980> is

00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:02.159 
perfectly the reasons why I do that is

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:04.670 
perfectly the reasons why I do that is
because<00:04:02.400> that<00:04:02.579> edge<00:04:02.909> will<00:04:03.120> be<00:04:03.209> cocked<00:04:03.480> now<00:04:04.319> if

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
because that edge will be cocked now if

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.979 
because that edge will be cocked now if
you<00:04:04.829> look<00:04:05.010> down<00:04:05.760> on<00:04:05.819> the<00:04:06.060> top<00:04:06.239> vers<00:04:06.659> at<00:04:06.870> the

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
you look down on the top vers at the

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:11.690 
you look down on the top vers at the
bottom<00:04:07.379> top<00:04:07.769> is<00:04:07.980> perfect<00:04:08.579> bottom<00:04:09.090> is<00:04:09.680> not<00:04:10.700> why

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
bottom top is perfect bottom is not why

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.180 
bottom top is perfect bottom is not why
I<00:04:11.730> mean<00:04:12.030> by<00:04:12.180> that<00:04:12.299> is<00:04:12.540> when<00:04:13.379> you<00:04:13.530> put<00:04:13.680> a<00:04:13.709> texture

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
I mean by that is when you put a texture

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.879 
I mean by that is when you put a texture
on<00:04:14.370> that<00:04:15.239> one<00:04:15.799> it's<00:04:16.799> still<00:04:17.400> being<00:04:17.669> generated

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:18.889 
on that one it's still being generated

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:21.890 
on that one it's still being generated
back<00:04:19.889> behind<00:04:20.099> there<00:04:20.400> it<00:04:20.820> sits<00:04:21.389> underneath

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
back behind there it sits underneath

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.629 
back behind there it sits underneath
there<00:04:22.169> you<00:04:22.380> don't<00:04:22.560> see<00:04:22.800> if<00:04:22.860> the<00:04:23.070> system<00:04:23.340> still

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:23.639 
there you don't see if the system still

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:27.140 
there you don't see if the system still
rendering<00:04:24.030> it<00:04:24.240> and<00:04:25.340> to<00:04:26.340> give<00:04:26.490> you<00:04:26.520> a<00:04:26.610> good<00:04:27.120> idea

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
rendering it and to give you a good idea

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.219 
rendering it and to give you a good idea
of<00:04:27.510> what<00:04:27.690> I'm<00:04:27.780> talking<00:04:28.199> about<00:04:28.260> we're<00:04:29.070> going<00:04:29.220> to

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:30.229 
of what I'm talking about we're going to

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:32.629 
of what I'm talking about we're going to
show<00:04:31.229> you<00:04:31.289> the<00:04:31.650> difference<00:04:32.099> between<00:04:32.520> the

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
show you the difference between the

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:36.170 
show you the difference between the
bottom<00:04:33.000> and<00:04:33.150> the<00:04:33.419> top<00:04:33.449> versions<00:04:34.229> of<00:04:35.060> what<00:04:36.060> I've

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
bottom and the top versions of what I've

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.580 
bottom and the top versions of what I've
done<00:04:36.380> by<00:04:37.380> going<00:04:37.710> into<00:04:38.220> the<00:04:38.340> filters<00:04:38.760> and

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
done by going into the filters and

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.529 
done by going into the filters and
taking<00:04:40.590> off<00:04:40.710> the<00:04:41.010> we<00:04:42.000> can<00:04:42.150> see<00:04:42.300> the<00:04:42.389> back

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:42.539 
taking off the we can see the back

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:45.020 
taking off the we can see the back
side<00:04:42.780> of<00:04:42.810> the<00:04:43.320> wall<00:04:43.470> see<00:04:43.770> the<00:04:43.889> bottom<00:04:44.220> the

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
side of the wall see the bottom the

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.900 
side of the wall see the bottom the
bottom<00:04:45.180> half<00:04:45.479> of<00:04:45.599> it<00:04:45.780> is<00:04:46.190> see<00:04:47.190> that<00:04:47.310> long<00:04:47.520> piece

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
bottom half of it is see that long piece

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.850 
bottom half of it is see that long piece
but<00:04:48.630> yet<00:04:48.870> the<00:04:49.050> top<00:04:49.380> half<00:04:49.740> does<00:04:50.210> not<00:04:51.210> have<00:04:51.419> that

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
but yet the top half does not have that

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.890 
but yet the top half does not have that
this<00:04:52.860> is<00:04:53.070> advanced<00:04:53.460> mapping<00:04:53.789> if<00:04:54.330> you<00:04:54.570> get<00:04:54.720> used

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
this is advanced mapping if you get used

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.270 
this is advanced mapping if you get used
to<00:04:55.050> this<00:04:55.139> right<00:04:55.530> away<00:04:55.710> in<00:04:55.919> the<00:04:56.010> very<00:04:56.159> beginning

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
to this right away in the very beginning

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.520 
to this right away in the very beginning
of<00:04:56.580> your<00:04:56.669> mapping<00:04:56.880> stages<00:04:57.360> you<00:04:57.930> are<00:04:58.139> going<00:04:58.349> to

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
of your mapping stages you are going to

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.279 
of your mapping stages you are going to
have<00:04:58.919> a<00:04:58.949> much<00:04:59.250> nicer<00:04:59.639> quality<00:05:00.270> map<00:05:00.930> and<00:05:01.169> it's

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:01.289 
have a much nicer quality map and it's

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:02.420 
have a much nicer quality map and it's
going<00:05:01.440> to<00:05:01.500> run<00:05:01.650> a<00:05:01.680> lot<00:05:01.860> better<00:05:02.070> it's

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
going to run a lot better it's

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.670 
going to run a lot better it's
essentially<00:05:02.909> for<00:05:03.060> optimization<00:05:03.599> of<00:05:03.960> the

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
essentially for optimization of the

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.649 
essentially for optimization of the
engine<00:05:05.159> so<00:05:05.699> what<00:05:05.880> we<00:05:06.000> would<00:05:06.150> do<00:05:06.330> is<00:05:06.479> we<00:05:06.510> would

00:05:06.649 --> 00:05:06.659 
engine so what we would do is we would

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:09.710 
engine so what we would do is we would
change<00:05:06.990> those<00:05:07.470> and<00:05:07.770> my<00:05:08.070> 2d<00:05:08.460> view<00:05:08.729> here<00:05:09.060> and

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 
change those and my 2d view here and

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.149 
change those and my 2d view here and
we're<00:05:09.990> going<00:05:10.080> to<00:05:10.139> put<00:05:10.229> that<00:05:10.590> back<00:05:10.919> on

00:05:11.149 --> 00:05:11.159 
we're going to put that back on

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:13.279 
we're going to put that back on
just<00:05:11.490> for<00:05:11.729> a<00:05:11.760> moment

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:13.289 
just for a moment

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:16.459 
just for a moment
so<00:05:14.039> it<00:05:14.249> looks<00:05:14.279> like<00:05:14.490> we're<00:05:14.819> almost<00:05:15.419> ready<00:05:16.050> we

00:05:16.459 --> 00:05:16.469 
so it looks like we're almost ready we

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:20.929 
so it looks like we're almost ready we
got<00:05:16.559> two<00:05:16.830> more<00:05:17.039> to<00:05:17.069> go<00:05:17.189> here<00:05:19.309> hit<00:05:20.309> the<00:05:20.430> e<00:05:20.460> key

00:05:20.929 --> 00:05:20.939 
got two more to go here hit the e key

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:25.010 
got two more to go here hit the e key
bring<00:05:21.449> that<00:05:21.629> down<00:05:22.430> Yuki<00:05:23.430> bring<00:05:23.849> that<00:05:24.059> over<00:05:24.270> now

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
bring that down Yuki bring that over now

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.230 
bring that down Yuki bring that over now
we<00:05:25.589> have<00:05:25.710> a<00:05:25.740> little<00:05:25.949> bit<00:05:26.099> of<00:05:26.129> an<00:05:26.249> angled<00:05:26.669> map

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
we have a little bit of an angled map

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.499 
we have a little bit of an angled map
but<00:05:28.139> when<00:05:28.469> you<00:05:29.430> go<00:05:29.550> and<00:05:29.639> place<00:05:29.849> a<00:05:29.879> texture<00:05:30.389> on

00:05:30.499 --> 00:05:30.509 
but when you go and place a texture on

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:37.129 
but when you go and place a texture on
it<00:05:33.050> change<00:05:34.050> a<00:05:34.110> little<00:05:34.199> bit<00:05:34.319> texture<00:05:34.710> there<00:05:36.139> let

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:37.139 
it change a little bit texture there let

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:41.659 
it change a little bit texture there let
me<00:05:37.169> turn<00:05:37.319> the<00:05:37.649> off<00:05:39.229> it<00:05:40.229> is<00:05:40.589> it's<00:05:41.279> the<00:05:41.520> way

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:41.669 
me turn the off it is it's the way

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:45.829 
me turn the off it is it's the way
it's<00:05:41.849> supposed<00:05:41.969> to<00:05:42.240> be<00:05:43.849> that's<00:05:44.849> if<00:05:45.689> you<00:05:45.809> can

00:05:45.829 --> 00:05:45.839 
it's supposed to be that's if you can

00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:47.389 
it's supposed to be that's if you can
see<00:05:46.020> that<00:05:46.050> they're<00:05:46.439> in<00:05:46.589> my<00:05:46.680> little<00:05:46.919> 3d<00:05:47.189> view

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:47.399 
see that they're in my little 3d view

00:05:47.399 --> 00:05:48.649 
see that they're in my little 3d view
I'm<00:05:47.520> zipping<00:05:47.939> around<00:05:48.029> it<00:05:48.270> pretty<00:05:48.449> quick

00:05:48.649 --> 00:05:48.659 
I'm zipping around it pretty quick

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:50.659 
I'm zipping around it pretty quick
because<00:05:48.839> it's<00:05:49.169> a<00:05:49.259> speed<00:05:49.619> mapping<00:05:50.009> baby<00:05:50.189> and

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:50.669 
because it's a speed mapping baby and

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:55.399 
because it's a speed mapping baby and
that's<00:05:51.389> pretty<00:05:51.689> much<00:05:51.899> it<00:05:52.050> for<00:05:54.289> rotation<00:05:55.289> edge

00:05:55.399 --> 00:05:55.409 
that's pretty much it for rotation edge

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:57.769 
that's pretty much it for rotation edge
flip<00:05:55.649> tools<00:05:55.889> and<00:05:56.610> next<00:05:57.209> one<00:05:57.360> I'll<00:05:57.569> go<00:05:57.689> ahead

00:05:57.769 --> 00:05:57.779 
flip tools and next one I'll go ahead

00:05:57.779 --> 00:06:01.820 
flip tools and next one I'll go ahead
and<00:05:59.029> I'll<00:06:00.029> put<00:06:00.209> in<00:06:00.330> the<00:06:00.509> not<00:06:01.199> the<00:06:01.289> subtract<00:06:01.649> but

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
and I'll put in the not the subtract but

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:04.249 
and I'll put in the not the subtract but
i'll<00:06:02.129> do<00:06:02.279> the<00:06:02.399> hollowing<00:06:02.699> out<00:06:02.909> tool<00:06:03.149> but<00:06:03.719> catch

00:06:04.249 --> 00:06:04.259 
i'll do the hollowing out tool but catch

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:06.529 
i'll do the hollowing out tool but catch
me<00:06:04.409> the<00:06:04.499> forms<00:06:04.740> this<00:06:04.860> was<00:06:05.069> a<00:06:05.099> x8<00:06:05.909> 105<00:06:06.240> at<00:06:06.389> solve

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:06.539 
me the forms this was a x8 105 at solve

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:08.239 
me the forms this was a x8 105 at solve
it<00:06:06.629> you<00:06:06.719> can<00:06:06.839> talk<00:06:06.959> about<00:06:07.020> top<00:06:07.619> good<00:06:07.800> zombie
