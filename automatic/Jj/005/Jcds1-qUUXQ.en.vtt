00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 playing had never been so tasty nor 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:16.139
 cook so fun this is cooking 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:17.520
 tower with a lot of help as they are 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.920
 welcome to cook your fridge is going to 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.240
 make a very simple recipe that I 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.769
 I think it will take us more than 15 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.630
 minutes to do it I think you can 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.269
 serve if they have to accompany some 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:31.789
 fish as an input or as a salad 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.789
 it's going very well and we're going to try couscous 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.510
 The first thing you have to do is put 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.250
 the water drink we are going to need a 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.590
 cup of water because we are going to make a 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:54.269
 cup of couscous to water we are going to put 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.269
 a little salt and a little oil 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:07.600
 to discard the tomatoes is very 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.640
 simple the only thing you have to do 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.979
 is to make a cross for the part of 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.439
 where it's like the navel and we're going to 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:17.350
 put in boiling water approximately 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:20.700
 about 30 to 40 seconds you take them out and go to 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.700
 It is very easy to remove the skin 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.280
 how 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.429
 since they are escaped and tomatoes 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.409
 we are going to remove the seeds and we are going 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:44.740
 to chop very finite along with the rest of 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:44.740
 the ingredients 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.450
 no no 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.570
 the couscous is very simple the only thing 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.910
 you have to do is put it in a 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.920
 you're going to put the cup of 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.050
 more or less water to cover it you're going to 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.640
 leave 5 minutes to rest and then with 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.170
 We are going to spin a fork for 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.770
 that is separating and fluff 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.770
 slightly 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.730
