00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
cover with the type cover 2 first let's

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:22.429 
cover with the type cover 2 first let's
unbox<00:00:14.250> this<00:00:20.330> so<00:00:21.330> on<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.689> left<00:00:21.900> here<00:00:22.170> we've<00:00:22.350> got

one<00:01:36.960> you<00:01:37.110> can<00:01:37.229> actually<00:01:37.680> physically<00:01:38.130> clip

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
one you can actually physically clip

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.260 
one you can actually physically clip
down<00:01:39.229> instead<00:01:40.229> of<00:01:40.290> this<00:01:40.740> one<00:01:41.040> which<00:01:41.369> is<00:01:41.400> touch

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
down instead of this one which is touch
