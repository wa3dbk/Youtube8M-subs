doubt and the acceleration activities
but<00:02:11.190> it<00:02:11.520> also<00:02:11.670> shows<00:02:12.000> how<00:02:12.209> well<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.570> car

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
but it also shows how well the car

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.690 
but it also shows how well the car
changes<00:02:13.140> direction<00:02:13.650> and<00:02:14.010> particularly<00:02:14.430> how
