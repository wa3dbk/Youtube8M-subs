00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 well all guys orgasms that are here 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.080
 to bring you a new builder shield 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.840
 we have a very good team a lot 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.330
 strong and interesting to try with mi 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.460
 seems like 4 different leagues e 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.160
 however as you will have seen I think from the 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.660
 Miniature there will be de pajtim I decided 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.640
 which I absolutely wanted to try because 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.730
 has scary statistics therefore 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.490
 we immediately start module 4 3 3 with the 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.310
 playmaker 15 st a good form 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.700
 let's start immediately with the goalkeeper if that 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.540
 I find and it is not weidenfeller is not leno 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.710
 however it is another German that is ter stegen 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.270
 used barcelona goalkeeper 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.219
 several times this year because I am 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.620
 quite a good goalkeeper yes 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.320
 maybe get better next year 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:48.329
 placement would perhaps be a 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.460
 great goalkeeper however has gods 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.640
 tuff values ​​and very good reflections 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.600
 then right back then let's go to 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:00.170
 see here among the not rare 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.690
 grosskreutz of bb borussia dortmund 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.790
 good full back by the way 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.040
 as a jorge player so high then 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.690
 advances and also returns back to defend 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.850
 anyway, as I said, I said good ones 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.399
 statistics in each statistics so it is 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.200
 a great fullback if so faster but 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:17.509
 would be bad is not very fast her 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.740
 department mate here at a like 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:20.810
 central defender on the right ie 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:24.799
 hummels but defensively 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:28.729
 however, 99.9 per fortissimo 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:32.270
 one hundred of the players of altimetry 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:34.310
 beccate anno obama young type tiff in 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.679
 attack with a million speed e 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.270
 so it's also difficult for a month 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:40.940
 however, being able to stop it is known 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:44.720
 when it has to defend really strong 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:47.810
 then as how to call defender 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.909
 left central or a void I swear to you 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.250
 now I will try to look for it but I swear 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:55.510
 that I have a resounding emptiness no otam endi 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:59.110
 terrestrial otamendi that 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:01.750
 which I liked pretty much practically 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.220
 like a mels maybe a bit less in 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.320
 however defense is faster 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.970
 so it's a great player too 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.010
 Get this your upgrade version 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.340
 and to complete the defense as a fullback 

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:15.730
 left or used is the one here 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.620
 behind willems or behind willemsen so 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.810
 how to say that it is strong enough 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.250
 good in the sense is not bad is not 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.560
 too bad 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.990
 it is not the maximum in defense also because 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.080
 it is not very high but you could have the ability 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:31.570
 so fun to use then let's go 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.850
 in midfield we find the right cc 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:36.760
 or used 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:39.640
 let's go here right away with wheelchair 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.260
 is not the best midfielder from 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.200
 use in a two-handed midfield 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.490
 which is a little more defensive than offensive 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.880
 I was expecting something more from the shot 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:50.020
 of the truth instead a little low 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.459
 I repeat this player is better 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.500
 use a three- handed midfield 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:57.040
 away of its defensive qualities a little 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:59.950
 questionable but I had to use him 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.200
 for the way I wanted to play then 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.390
 as the central midfielder of 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.220
 left or used another player 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.959
 who received an upgrade this year 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.650
 that is enzo perez that I really like 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.260
 much 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.940
 four games one goal and two assists not 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.890
 bad for a midfielder anyway 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.540
 a defender's work from da 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.769
 defensive midfielder 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.120
 I found myself really well a 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.890
 great shot from distance this 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.560
 player and I advise you to try if 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.870
 you are if you want to try it 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.720
 then like coc that I actually left 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:32.350
 acts that in any case made agreement is of 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.209
 maria who had already used me twice 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.920
 looks like in the last two scud builders mi 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:38.820
 really like it because it's a second tip 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:42.760
 attacking midfield player who also scores and does 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.989
 many assists as you see four games 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.790
 more or less than I used it with 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:48.850
 this team will have done me both 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.739
 goals and maybe 4 assists so it's a 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.830
 player who in this form as 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:56.739
 makes a great deal of man assists while 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:59.950
 for the attack we go as a right wing 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:01.300
 or used theo walcott who didn't 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.820
 made mad that is a 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:07.300
 3 only fast for the rest to a bad one 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:09.880
 shot that I did not like four steps 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:13.120
 3 stars p3 if the skills I meant 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:16.150
 which are not the best was better 4 is 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.519
 a passage that did not seem to me the 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:21.549
 much but a goal an assist in 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:24.040
 four games is not to be thrown away 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:26.530
 while as acts I have used the 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.930
 great aguero that you believe me this year 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.870
 I had not yet tried I was expecting 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:34.120
 much more from aguero it made only 4 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.860
 goal in 4 games I expected type 18 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.260
 goals in 4 games considering the 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.400
 statistics that he knows are scary 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.130
 considering also the price of 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.660
 player is however the various 4 stars 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.490
 truth autostyle weak foot work 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.430
 perfect I expected something more 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.380
 probably it is strong and maybe even 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.270
 I don't know in a two-man attack 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:55.140
 know what form if you have tried 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:58.090
 aguero 88 in which form via returned more 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:05:00.640
 while to conclude we have as I had 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:02.410
 anticipated depay team of the season that 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:05.080
 I paid the beauty of almost 700 thousand 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:08.890
 credits and in my opinion it is not worth them 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:10.450
 but I tell you that probably what 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:12.100
 I'm telling you now you don't have to 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:14.770
 take it too seriously because I don't know 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:17.020
 because it's when I play when I have too 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.940
 one player iv with this case 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.320
 moment my team decisions 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.690
 players begin to become gods 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.530
 shit no longer pass the ball well not 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:27.100
 they manage to run handicapped 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.210
 I probably have problems with 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:31.930
 probably a problem of the game 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:33.730
 however it has not made much in this 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:36.460
 team probably would have been 

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:38.080
 better a depay does not inform that he would 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.120
 maybe even better played by 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.350
 what I tried did not seem to me 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.270
 a player able to do the 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:45.160
 difference completely that is not valid 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:47.620
 absolutely 700 thousand credits that are 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.720
 a fucking credit money however like 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:52.990
 you can see from these statistics are 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:55.930
 devastating it looks like a Christian 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:58.900
 ronaldo Dutch version with a rating 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:00.669
 a little lower however also 5 st el 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.950
 skill among other things however raga let me 

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:06.850
 know you in the comments if you have tried 

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:08.680
 the various aguero 87 buy in that way 

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:10.660
 you used because they change 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:13.600
 players from module to module let me 

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:14.229

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.150
 found better 

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:17.820
