00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
after that you're going to want to shift

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.849 
after that you're going to want to shift
fewer<00:01:45.490> pins<00:01:45.939> a<00:01:46.179> little<00:01:46.390> bit<00:01:46.509> to<00:01:47.409> catch<00:01:47.560> any

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:47.859 
fewer pins a little bit to catch any

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:49.950

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
where other might come on at the filter

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.090 
where other might come on at the filter
middle<00:01:50.469> isn't<00:01:50.740> like<00:01:50.859> that

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
middle isn't like that

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.709 
middle isn't like that
and<00:01:51.429> I'll<00:01:51.609> get<00:01:51.759> to<00:01:51.909> a<00:01:51.939> point<00:01:52.179> where<00:01:52.420> you<00:01:52.509> can

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:52.719 
and I'll get to a point where you can

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:57.889 
and I'll get to a point where you can
just<00:01:54.509> technically<00:01:55.509> loose<00:01:55.750> it<00:01:55.929> by<00:01:56.079> hand

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
just technically loose it by hand

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.929 
just technically loose it by hand
can<00:01:58.899> you<00:01:58.959> tell<00:01:59.140> us<00:01:59.170> what's<00:01:59.409> happening<00:01:59.799> oh<00:02:00.189> yeah

the right-hand side of the car where the
filter<00:02:11.980> is<00:02:12.220> you're<00:02:12.370> gonna<00:02:12.459> get<00:02:12.730> drenched<00:02:13.150> so

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
filter is you're gonna get drenched so

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.089

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
where do the Y's stay the left next

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:19.500 
where do the Y's stay the left next
you're<00:02:18.400> gonna<00:02:18.519> need<00:02:18.730> to<00:02:18.849> get<00:02:18.940> your<00:02:19.120> new<00:02:19.239> oil

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510
