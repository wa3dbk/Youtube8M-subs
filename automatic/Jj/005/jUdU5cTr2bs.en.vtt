00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
need to look at first is we need to add

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.639 
need to look at first is we need to add
something<00:00:38.010> to<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.309> database<00:00:39.440> right<00:00:40.440> now<00:00:40.590> we

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
something to the database right now we

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.280 
something to the database right now we
have<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.250> navigation<00:00:42.059> being<00:00:42.719> generated<00:00:43.170> from

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
have the navigation being generated from

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.990 
have the navigation being generated from
the<00:00:43.739> pages<00:00:44.129> that<00:00:44.160> are<00:00:44.340> in<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.460> database<00:00:44.760> but

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
the pages that are in the database but

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.440 
the pages that are in the database but

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
as we add more stuff like gallery blog

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.240 
as we add more stuff like gallery blog
things<00:00:48.930> like<00:00:49.140> that<00:00:49.289> other<00:00:49.530> parts<00:00:49.829> of<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.039> site

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250

this<00:00:51.239> method<00:00:51.660> isn't<00:00:51.809> necessarily<00:00:52.410> going<00:00:52.649> to

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
this method isn't necessarily going to

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.430 
this method isn't necessarily going to
work<00:00:52.829> so<00:00:53.820> we're<00:00:53.969> gonna<00:00:54.059> create<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.420> table<00:00:54.690> to

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
work so we're gonna create a table to

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.260 
work so we're gonna create a table to
hold<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.800> navigation<00:00:56.370> items<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:56.940> this<00:00:57.149> is

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
hold the navigation items and this is

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.790 
hold the navigation items and this is
gonna<00:00:57.390> give<00:00:57.570> us<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.750> lot<00:00:57.930> more<00:00:57.960> control<00:00:58.530> over

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
gonna give us a lot more control over

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.959 
gonna give us a lot more control over
this<00:00:59.520> stuff<00:00:59.760> so<00:01:00.300> I've<00:01:00.660> opened<00:01:01.109> up<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.969> old

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
this stuff so I've opened up the old

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.429 
this stuff so I've opened up the old
database<00:01:03.180> sketch<00:01:03.600> that<00:01:03.809> we've<00:01:03.930> used<00:01:04.140> already

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
database sketch that we've used already

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.649 
database sketch that we've used already
and<00:01:04.830> I'm<00:01:05.100> just<00:01:05.250> going<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.430> use<00:01:05.610> this<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:06.030> map

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
and I'm just going to use this to map

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.420 
and I'm just going to use this to map
out<00:01:06.869> what<00:01:06.990> we're<00:01:07.140> gonna<00:01:07.229> do<00:01:07.500> so<00:01:08.070> we'll<00:01:08.310> have<00:01:08.369> a

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
out what we're gonna do so we'll have a

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.010 
out what we're gonna do so we'll have a
table<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:08.970> we'll<00:01:09.119> probably<00:01:09.360> just<00:01:09.570> call<00:01:09.869> it

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
table and we'll probably just call it

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.510 
table and we'll probably just call it
navigation<00:01:11.810> and<00:01:12.810> as<00:01:13.740> usual<00:01:14.159> we're<00:01:14.250> gonna<00:01:14.340> need

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
navigation and as usual we're gonna need

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.969 
navigation and as usual we're gonna need
an<00:01:14.670> ID<00:01:14.820> for<00:01:15.119> this<00:01:15.240> that<00:01:16.170> we're<00:01:16.320> gonna<00:01:16.409> need<00:01:16.710> a

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
an ID for this that we're gonna need a

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.969 
an ID for this that we're gonna need a
label<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:18.090> this<00:01:18.240> would<00:01:18.420> be<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.780> visual<00:01:19.380> end

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
label and this would be the visual end

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.710 
label and this would be the visual end
of<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.220> you<00:01:20.369> know<00:01:20.460> home<00:01:20.790> about<00:01:21.240> us<00:01:21.479> whatever

know my home server if I wanted to put
this<00:05:01.090> up<00:05:01.240> online<00:05:02.010> then<00:05:03.010> I'd<00:05:03.130> have<00:05:03.250> an<00:05:03.370> issue

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.550 
this up online then I'd have an issue

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.330 
this up online then I'd have an issue
because<00:05:03.850> the<00:05:04.810> domain<00:05:05.350> name<00:05:05.560> would<00:05:05.710> change<00:05:05.980> the

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
because the domain name would change the

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.360 
because the domain name would change the
URL<00:05:06.910> would<00:05:07.120> change<00:05:07.360> and<00:05:07.900> now<00:05:08.740> I've<00:05:08.980> got<00:05:09.220> all

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
URL would change and now I've got all

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:10.890 
URL would change and now I've got all
these<00:05:09.490> kind<00:05:09.700> of<00:05:09.730> hard-coded<00:05:10.330> in<00:05:10.450> here<00:05:10.690> and<00:05:10.810> I'd

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
these kind of hard-coded in here and I'd

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.510 
these kind of hard-coded in here and I'd
have<00:05:11.020> to<00:05:11.110> go<00:05:11.230> through<00:05:11.560> and<00:05:11.740> change<00:05:11.980> them<00:05:12.220> each

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
have to go through and change them each

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.890 
have to go through and change them each
so<00:05:13.120> we'll<00:05:13.630> come<00:05:13.930> up<00:05:14.050> with<00:05:14.169> some<00:05:14.320> some<00:05:14.770> ways<00:05:14.919> to

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 
so we'll come up with some some ways to

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:21.110 
so we'll come up with some some ways to
make<00:05:16.900> that<00:05:17.050> work<00:05:17.110> better<00:05:17.550> so<00:05:18.550> I<00:05:18.580> could<00:05:18.880> go

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
make that work better so I could go

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.620 
make that work better so I could go
browse<00:05:22.120> and<00:05:23.940> there<00:05:24.940> we<00:05:25.030> go<00:05:25.180> we<00:05:25.300> should<00:05:25.450> be<00:05:25.510> good

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:25.630 
browse and there we go we should be good

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.780 
browse and there we go we should be good
to<00:05:25.750> go
