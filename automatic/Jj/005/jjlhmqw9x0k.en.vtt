00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:09.769
 what we have done is to open this slit 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:13.580
 from here 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:17.559
 where now will not spend cervo 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.559
 be the rod that will open 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.570
 to it used this trace of aluminum 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.849
 What is it 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:33.619
 an aluminum corner or you can see 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:33.619
 the widths here 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.739
 can see here 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.780
 has a brand 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.780
 more secret that is 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:57.750
 the server 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:00.960
 I would put them here I would put what 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.350
 we introduce here perfect month you will be 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.350
 I would open 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.890
 in the holes 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.020
 here 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.860
 on the other side too 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.979
 you can see 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.990
 when opening the new here and here perfect 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.230
 be up here that is not caught not 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.280
 nothing happens 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.280
 no problem 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.290
 be after 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:37.700
 to the mechanism 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.700
 we will put here your 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:44.050
 the leg of this special that brings the 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.050
 servo and there we will send it 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.190
 the rod that 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.640
 I have cut 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.190
 then yes, of course 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.320
 it would work good it should work 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:00.860
 perfect no 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:03.020
 would go up and down it would have to bend it like this 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.880
 take her to the position so that they pass 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.920
 well over here 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.860
 that's it 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:15.020
 and I think it will not have a problem 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.020
 Of course, the yellow would go through here 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.579
 reservation 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.579
 and it would go down 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.020
 and in the part from here on 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:36.930
 here in here, we'll hook it 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.210
 what is 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.550
 the rod for here inside 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:44.930
 in court inside so you can go 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:49.280
 backwards 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:55.090
 now here it would rise and fall like that for the 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:55.090
 right lateral 22 bases tracks 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:05.430
 it's easy and simple 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:08.540
 this makes a lighthouse stock 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:11.540
 what happens is that they will have to 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.540
 return 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.620
 make it show better in another video 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.840
 is the Serbo also gives you here I 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:25.670
 travel that makes 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.670
 there would be no problems and for the other side 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:33.860
 to test it with servo tester let's go 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.860
 testing 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.310
 I have used 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:42.520
 sometimes it is also now missing sanding 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.010
 a little 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.170
 as it has been scratched a little doing the 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.240
 work then I will throw a 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:54.930
 little putty and fix in the 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:54.930
 things sandpaper and again nothing happens 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.330
 and says that the putty by that rule all 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:01.670
 good 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.070
 this is what I have for now 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.720
 do 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:08.330
 and in the clear front 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:11.420
 this will be the one here 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.730
 the one that opens here and here ahead gets 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.700
 to another 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:18.920
 so to raise it 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:21.079
 will raise and this one will do if you see 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:24.009
 so lift up a little 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:24.009
 and puts his face 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.880
 the work that I will show you how 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.880
 it is staying
