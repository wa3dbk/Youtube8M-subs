00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.190
 more time to my channel and this new tutorial 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.980
 where I will show you how to download and 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.990
 install winrar in version 5 the 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.910
 last version that you have taken in this 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.460
 company and that is fully compatible 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.620
 with windows 8.1 and versions 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.440
 previous windows 8 professional 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:39.230
 preview be windows 7 from the home 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.390
 basic gastaldi mail is compatible with 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.830
 all these operating systems well 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.870
 Well before you start with the tutorial 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.760
 I invite you to overdo by the 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.580
 previous video on how to download 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.409
 in base 2014 how to download it how 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.150
 install it and activate it with a license 

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:56.120
 until 2016 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:58.519
 well I did not upload any extravagant with 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.769
 how they put in other videos or a 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:02.870
 license until 2050 until 2032 for 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:04.519
 reasons that you have to be honest 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.840
 computer will not last with the same 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.090
 installation of the operating system that 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.490
 have now until 2050 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.720
 neither is repealing 22 years in 2016 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.120
 because some mistake you have to make 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:17.720
 format it and you have to go back to 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:19.310
 to install but the difference is that 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.920
 We will use any serial 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.840
 installation but a license key 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.270
 six-month license is activated 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.030
 until 2016 and it activates all the 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:32.060
 functionalities of the antivirus database 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.860
 2014 the latest version well here you will be 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.710
 watching the capture there must already be 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.890
 disappeared I do not know I do not know how 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.300
 would have put it well then let's go with the 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.540
 tutorial in the description of the video 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:47.660
 is the stand the links you will find 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:50.510
 the four links two per mega and two per 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:53.140
 block that in this case is no longer called 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:56.560
 mocking but if not fair drive 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:59.250
 I do not know why they totally changed the 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:02.229
 page well that you will find from 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.350
 files for the two types of 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:07.260
 computer architecture either 32 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.690
 thousand 64 bits 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.950
 be in mega on fire drive in any 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.770
 of the two will find the same 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.260
 files for 64 and for 3 for 32 thousand 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.890
 how to know if your computer is 32 or 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.450
 64 bits in windows 8 or in 8.1 you go to 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.300
 menu here configuration 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:27.840
 pc information and here you go to 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:30.020
 find if your system is 64 of 32 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.020
 bits 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.810
 ok if they are in windows 7 in either 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.890
 of the windows 7 versions 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:41.270
 you're just going to start menu equipment 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.760
 well you put the control magician the mouse 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:46.310
 on the computer right click properties 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.740
 and then this same menu will appear 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.170
 that is that this same are fanning 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:55.220
 sorry system ok and you will be able to know 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:57.080
 if the 64 32 bit that just in case not 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:00.620
 I know but it's almost impossible 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:04.580
 quality does not know how to review is fine 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:06.620
 I'm going to approve 22 mega links 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.980
 as a file drive so they can see that the 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.810
 files are working 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.209
 I'll wait here for you to load in the 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:16.090
 five seconds express copied the mega 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.739
 I already put the fair light you can 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.310
 download the file by any of 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:23.440
 the two of the two pages image as 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.060
 see here is is the interface that will 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.890
 to give now to filter before the 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.420
 call put locker when you give 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:32.069
 download 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.069
 and you have him 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:37.150
 the integrando de manager or is going to 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.510
 start downloading or you can download 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:42.400
 the file directly with the 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.450
 google chrome downloader of the 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.760
 dependent of the browser that is 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.610
 use well as you will see they are both 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.740
 records 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:53.220
 they are fully functional as you see 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:56.290
 here is already starting the download ready 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.810
 well I already have it downloaded 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:02.040
 so I will not download it 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:04.230
 note that these are the two files 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:07.200
 and both are already fully activated 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:09.569
 be it for the 64-bit or 32-bit version 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.680
 everything is already fully activated 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:14.790
 what we have to do is click 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:17.729
 right open or double click to 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:20.820
 start the exe file as you see is a 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:25.590
 ex file we will execute in my case 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:28.530
 it's 64 bits that's why I'm installing 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.000
 64 in your case it will be maybe 32 or 64 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.120
 bits you will choose either the two 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.490
 files you click on install before 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.020
 examine that the folder is not going to 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.370
 install in the winrar folder this 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.789
 folder will create it if you do not have 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:43.139
 installed the winrar or it will create you another 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:44.930
 overwrite data about a 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:47.820
 version of previous questar that you have 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:51.210
 you'll come back in version 5 let's install 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.680
 this is very fast well in this window 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.630
 from here I recommend you leave such and 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.660
 as it is since if we select 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:05:00.300
 iso files place with an extension and 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:03.599
 that is not an extension that manages 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:05.220
 winrar manage this this program so 

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:08.289
 we just let her click on 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:10.119
 accept and we click on and 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:12.819
 ok let's open this file that is 

00:05:10.119 --> 00:05:15.399
 in the windows shortcut and let's go 

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:17.229
 to see that he does not ask us for any serial 

00:05:15.399 --> 00:05:19.629
 activation 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:22.360
 let's go here help about windows 

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:26.020
 and let's see what the program is says 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:28.180
 winrar 5 64 bits 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.190
 says he's registered by 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.169
 evans virtual exchanges 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.599
 are the credits for the page 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:36.099
 virtual exchanges heretic point and 

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:40.449
 that they are the ones who took care of 

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:42.759
 activate the program and share it already 

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:45.550
 activate well what we do is click 

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:47.860
 here in accept and click on close and as 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:50.740
 you will see we have installed our 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:53.349
 winrar the latest compatible version 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:56.129
 windows 8 and good is compatible with 

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:56.129
 previous versions 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:02.970
