how are you sir hey I'm doing pretty
good<00:00:18.000> how<00:00:18.210> about<00:00:18.240> yourself

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
good how about yourself

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.189 
good how about yourself
fantastic<00:00:19.890> we<00:00:20.070> got<00:00:20.340> your<00:00:20.699> wife's<00:00:21.390> car<00:00:21.750> here<00:00:22.140> in

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
fantastic we got your wife's car here in

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.950 
fantastic we got your wife's car here in
the<00:00:22.260> shop<00:00:22.500> and<00:00:22.740> we<00:00:22.800> did<00:00:23.010> some<00:00:23.220> preliminary

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:23.960 
the shop and we did some preliminary

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.300 
the shop and we did some preliminary
looks<00:00:24.960> at<00:00:25.199> it<00:00:25.410> what<00:00:25.590> did<00:00:25.710> you<00:00:25.830> guys<00:00:25.949> bring<00:00:26.250> the

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
looks at it what did you guys bring the

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.630 
looks at it what did you guys bring the
car<00:00:26.580> in<00:00:26.789> for<00:00:27.090> a<00:00:27.800> small<00:00:28.800> leak<00:00:29.010> in<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.220> back<00:00:29.369> tire

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
car in for a small leak in the back tire

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.319 
car in for a small leak in the back tire
and<00:00:29.970> also<00:00:30.480> an<00:00:31.109> oil<00:00:31.349> change<00:00:31.470> yeah<00:00:32.430> your<00:00:32.730> uh<00:00:32.759> we

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
and also an oil change yeah your uh we

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:34.910 
and also an oil change yeah your uh we
did<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.600> oil<00:00:33.750> change<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.410> we<00:00:34.500> were<00:00:34.590> looking

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
did the oil change and we were looking

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.970 
did the oil change and we were looking
at<00:00:35.010> your<00:00:35.100> transistor<00:00:35.820> module<00:00:36.469> by<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.530> fan

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
at your transistor module by the fan

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.490 
at your transistor module by the fan
belt<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.640> that<00:00:38.969> looks<00:00:39.360> like<00:00:39.989> it<00:00:40.170> might<00:00:40.469> need

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
belt and that looks like it might need

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.440 
belt and that looks like it might need
to<00:00:40.739> be<00:00:40.890> replaced<00:00:41.340> because<00:00:41.610> that's<00:00:41.940> causing<00:00:42.210> a

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
to be replaced because that's causing a

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.500 
to be replaced because that's causing a
lot<00:00:42.629> of<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.780> leaking<00:00:43.850> I'm<00:00:44.850> not<00:00:45.059> quite<00:00:45.480> sure

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
lot of the leaking I'm not quite sure

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.510 
lot of the leaking I'm not quite sure
I've<00:00:45.809> heard<00:00:45.989> of<00:00:46.110> that<00:00:46.320> go<00:00:47.129> ahead

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
I've heard of that go ahead

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.220 
I've heard of that go ahead
it's<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:47.910> transistor<00:00:48.450> module<00:00:48.870> it's<00:00:49.079> a

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
it's a transistor module it's a

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.630 
it's a transistor module it's a
basically<00:00:49.590> one<00:00:49.739> of<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.920> apparatuses<00:00:50.550> that

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
basically one of the apparatuses that

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.610 
basically one of the apparatuses that
connects<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.300> fan<00:00:51.480> belt<00:00:51.750> which<00:00:52.050> connects

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
connects to the fan belt which connects

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.959 
connects to the fan belt which connects
your<00:00:52.980> hose<00:00:53.300> to<00:00:54.300> your<00:00:54.510> transistor<00:00:55.190> okay<00:00:56.190> okay

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
your hose to your transistor okay okay

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.450 
your hose to your transistor okay okay
and<00:00:57.180> then<00:00:57.239> your<00:00:57.930> thought<00:00:58.590> of<00:00:58.710> transistor<00:00:59.280> was

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
and then your thought of transistor was

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.760 
and then your thought of transistor was
the<00:00:59.579> radio<00:00:59.879> no<00:01:00.359> your<00:01:00.570> transistor<00:01:01.109> capacity

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
the radio no your transistor capacity

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.579 
the radio no your transistor capacity
which<00:01:02.039> is<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.850> UV<00:01:03.030> valve<00:01:03.480> that's<00:01:04.049> on<00:01:04.320> Dawg

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
which is the UV valve that's on Dawg

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.100 
which is the UV valve that's on Dawg
yeah<00:01:05.460> we're<00:01:06.240> gonna<00:01:06.360> have<00:01:06.570> your<00:01:06.689> car<00:01:06.900> already

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
yeah we're gonna have your car already

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.649 
yeah we're gonna have your car already
tomorrow<00:01:07.439> for<00:01:07.890> your<00:01:08.010> chars<00:01:08.280> gonna<00:01:08.520> be<00:01:08.659> $230

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
tomorrow for your chars gonna be $230

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.560 
tomorrow for your chars gonna be $230
and<00:01:09.840> we<00:01:09.900> can<00:01:10.049> make<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:10.290> happen

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
and we can make that happen

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.030 
and we can make that happen
230<00:01:12.570> bucks<00:01:13.939> yes<00:01:14.939> is<00:01:15.450> that<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.600> problem

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
230 bucks yes is that a problem

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.649 
230 bucks yes is that a problem
you're<00:01:17.040> way<00:01:17.250> overboard<00:01:17.790> that's<00:01:18.299> kind<00:01:18.600> of

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
you're way overboard that's kind of

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.600 
you're way overboard that's kind of
unacceptable<00:01:19.040> well<00:01:20.040> like<00:01:20.159> I<00:01:20.280> said<00:01:20.340> the

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
unacceptable well like I said the

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.899 
unacceptable well like I said the
transistor<00:01:21.150> valve<00:01:21.330> is<00:01:21.479> tricky<00:01:21.750> well<00:01:22.909> I'm

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
transistor valve is tricky well I'm

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.320 
transistor valve is tricky well I'm
sorry<00:01:24.150> but<00:01:24.299> if<00:01:24.450> you<00:01:24.540> want<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.810> card<00:01:25.310> $23<00:01:26.330> you

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
sorry but if you want the card $23 you

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.100 
sorry but if you want the card $23 you
want<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.720> car

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
want the car

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.420 
want the car
it's<00:01:28.729> $230<00:01:29.960> that's<00:01:30.960> unacceptable<00:01:31.470> well

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
it's $230 that's unacceptable well

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.490 
it's $230 that's unacceptable well

talking about boys and pickles sir I

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.069 
talking about boys and pickles sir I
don't<00:01:54.149> know<00:01:54.210> where<00:01:54.450> you're<00:01:54.600> trying<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.960> go

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
don't know where you're trying to go

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.630 
don't know where you're trying to go
with<00:01:55.170> this<00:01:55.290> conversation<00:01:55.500> I'm<00:01:56.219> just<00:01:56.490> trying

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
with this conversation I'm just trying

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.389
