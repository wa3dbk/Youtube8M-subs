00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:13.070
 hello you, I hope you are fine 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.670
 Well 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:20.310
 Today I've thought about it 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.760
 meanwhile very many of these 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.900
 I do not like that then 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.080
 That's why I want one 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:31.529
 Storage for building and pounding 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:37.489
 her box that is now a whole 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:40.950
 normal pub casket the hand that is 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:46.829
 la cream for napkin technology then 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:49.680
 brush served and acrylic paint with it 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.170
 we put the box and brush 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.399
 this is the basic equipment have then 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.440
 I still a few things to 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:59.210
 Decorate lie down that's just the way it is 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:03.629
 for sparkling stones so butterflies 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:05.549
 deco spree in silver is actually for 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.340
 christmas for a christmas goose or 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.250
 but never mind 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.000
 yes, I have now misused and sometimes 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.619
 then I thought about it 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.360
 do something with the buttons on it 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.420
 the experienced euro cost the goods 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.580
 from the caddy so the tip for ten 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.390
 heads 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.549
 and then I have one more 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.590
 I still know that gift ribbon 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.890
 not whether I use that and if such 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:32.450
 and I just have it with me now 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:35.400
 in there we catch it 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.979
 and most importantly the crawlers 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.110
 gemstone glue because without the could 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.119
 which afterwards the deco do not install 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:47.180
 I forgot that so it is whole 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:50.130
 important so let's start with the 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:53.250
 acrylic paint and most importantly lies down 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.430
 what the bottom because if you are with it 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.899
 overheated and then yes no matter if that 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.070
 table is the bed no matter where you are 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:04.799
 does that mess up so now we give 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.259
 a big click on the color on it 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:11.680
 and just paint the whole box 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:15.349
 white outside above 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.420
 completely if necessary two times over it 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:20.659
 brush as with me because the pattern 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.260
 translucent so now we build one 

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:26.629
 I just forgot to call scissors 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:29.569
 Stayed served and served 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:32.000
 then you start the top layer 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.620
 decoupling napkins thats mostly 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.409
 three pieces so sometimes a bit 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:42.859
 Fummelarbeit pulls that off completely and 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:48.200
 if you have that then you take it 

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:49.760
 the scissors and can whole team of the 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.810
 serviette cut the yes afterwards 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.810
 sticks to the box 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.750
 then he picks up the brush and the 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.780
 napkins sheet brush the whole 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.830
 douse with it 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.830
 also do not forget the dealers please 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:22.819
 and then you bring the napkin and 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:27.329
 it sticks on it 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:29.340
 so sticks on it then cd on it 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:32.549
 bit smooth that has no waves and 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.859
 then we start to push the and 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:37.370
 especially the ones on the edge 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:37.370
 to click 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:45.150
 we can cut that over with 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:45.150
 the scissors off 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:57.219
 so now if you did that 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:04:01.159
 paint again and start all over 

00:03:57.219 --> 00:04:04.159
 edging and snapping off with the 

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:06.700
 Brush on or brush suit 

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:06.700
 no matter 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:19.060
 the whole of the lower part, of course, too 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:21.519
 but make important the piece where the 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.860
 lid on it is not stuck here 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.570
 otherwise it will not work like this anymore 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:29.639
 it goes to the deco I in my case 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:32.169
 do you have silver spray this year and 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:33.690
 then do it around perplexed on it 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:36.970
 as I like it 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.830
 I would not have to do it that way 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.740
 somehow does not lead me that way either 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:45.010
 No matter, I think that looks cool 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:47.040
 afterwards with the rest and yes that makes 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:50.830
 you then or not and then 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:53.530
 Let's move on so now you take it 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.780
 again the deco glue and I recommend 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.520
 old tweezers so the tweezers 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:00.970
 because of the stones but so an old 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:03.340
 I was thinking if the glue was there 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:08.919
 comes to the pin put tweezers and 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:11.020
 then they are not correct anymore then so 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:13.570
 catch us now times to the box-to 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:15.669
 Stick with your big stuff yours 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:18.160
 you have laid ready yes there comes 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:19.900
 nothing more so I do that then 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.380
 now and show you later 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.380
 finished result 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:39.980
 so that is now finished my kess 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:41.510
 leyen for my hair - and yes that was 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:43.220
 actually no big witchcraft 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:45.260
 but actually nothing 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:47.510
 really new thing I have shown but 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:49.550
 I like it and it helps me 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:52.400
 haircaps and I thought 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:55.510
 I share the idea with you yes 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:57.560
 Maybe you like it quite well 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:58.880
 and I did not know that yet 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.050
 can that on all boxes and 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:04.820
 little box and no idea what you have 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:08.420
 Yes, that is fast 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:15.230
 made up to yes the dry season 

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:17.150
 in between and yes then I would 

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:19.490
 this place just say if 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:22.070

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:24.680
