00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 compiled regarding the last 

00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:05.279
 best and most amazing sighting 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.990
 of this for example happens to a 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.760
 australia what is the feature this 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.460
 video that in broad daylight 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.099
 the object is so bright that it looks 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:18.119
 hairs and signs please look at this was 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:20.189
 on June 15, enough of the year 2012 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.560
 australia as I said tremendously 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.210
 bright but look or supposedly 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.460
 that was identified as a single 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.890
 object with a cluster of lights this is 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.340
 not to doubt when the object is is 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.190
 lean towards the camera and we can see the 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.350
 lateral edge 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.609
 we can understand let's say those lights 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.110
 they are like the bottom part of the 

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:41.269
 impression of this national repulsion 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.160
 put your palms uncertain as I 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:46.010
 like with the part I needed 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.870
 landing is crazy because the lights do not 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.989
 are absolutely what one could 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.519
 say is to balance your composition not 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:54.969
 they're completely let's say it's for a 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:54.969
 same distance 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.460
 and when you put it on your side you see that a 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:03.440
 not only great and magnanimous object but 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.110
 that in addition to light comparisons to plans 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.430
 of the day to win light competition 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.710
 solar means that it has to be 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.140
 tremendously bright and finally it 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:17.210
 see that it is a lenticular object 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:19.729
 which is the classic dish the time of 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.800
 day do they really think in the 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.270
 concern that what is going to happen or 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.670
 whatever it is that we have left 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.369
 determinedly point through 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.170
 you are manipulated but read an email 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:31.490
 comes and will tell us about these 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.950
 people who had supposedly seen 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:37.009
 a fuselage of fairly soon arrives 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:39.920
 from khatib and says hello there is a zoom with 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.899
 this photo that was taken in window the 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.820
 2010 really do not know what 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:46.280
 it will be but it is not good she is 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.350
 mentally in the photo he put a 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.030
 little circle and an arrow saying this its 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.429
 name what is enclosed in the 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.229
 circle and once again what you have to 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:57.140
 understand is that thanks to the effect to the 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.610
 sunlight they created a curtain almost 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.950
 white back so that the object 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.610
 could stand out on the landscape of 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.960
 sunset 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.140
 obviously the lake 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.909
 is a point that is seen there let's say not 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.950
 reach to see details given let's say the 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:12.500
 pixilation of the camera in question without 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.959
 However one can once again calculate 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.850
 distances distances and seems to be a 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.500
 immensely large object what when 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.330
 we say great convert part a micro 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.100
 with clear teto that brings more realism 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.290
 the fact that it is as good as it did 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.660
 this the fact that it has so much light of 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.209
 Sun from behind causes a blur 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.640
 on the edge what makes it very difficult 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:34.100
 tricking at that specific point because 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.600
 true pixelization would be very notorious 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.980
 the pixels would be mounted for him 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.180
 would be true the radio around the 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.409
 sunlight 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:44.870
 today good moments ago I say here 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:46.969
 a message from Isabel that she tells me 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.370
 that she lives in elqui valley and that 

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:51.650
 It is known that there paihuano sector 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.239
 a rumor many years ago good for 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.829
 all for anyone unknown that the 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.980
 bayern the kit for a lot of people have a 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:59.599
 mystical energy very special in the 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.569
 sector of paihuano a person would have 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:04.939
 kept in his house a kind as of 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:06.109
 elongated fuselage of what could be 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:08.510
 an unidentified flying object 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:10.939
 we sit here salfate knows well that 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:14.150
 history also of that landing that 

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:16.400
 it was quickly shut up that we had 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.310
 even history of testimony from 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.980
 people who saw this spaceship 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.750
 and it's the fuselage 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.280
 we should try if we can 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.599
 please send to our mail more 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.669
 information so you can make a 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:30.799
 photography to share it with our 

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:32.959
 there could be two conventional or this 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:35.900
 case is tremendously documented and I 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:38.000
 I found out because he approached what was 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.010
 he knows as a privileged witness that he is 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.500
 a high-ranking carabinier and he tells me 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.420
 that I do not mention me please but I 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.520
 participate in that operation 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.110
 obviously they told me with the truth or 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.730
 be that what you have is the concept that 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.319
 he asks me but our 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.050
 recommendation is that the parrot dies 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:56.840
 keep quiet where was the one who told him 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:58.730
 they took in large trucks in part and 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.440
 obviously, nothing has happened here 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.510
 everything afterwards when putting together other 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.489
 people that already happens here fell off 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.840
 this object and they lived like a people 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:07.840
 girls already or that you the same 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.290
 but directly here let's say I'm 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.329
 I say a static globero with everything 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.519
 and thank you very much for the help here a 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.900
 zone kiss house did not comment it with the 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.639
 abwehr and when we talk about fuselage 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.440
 have to share the ship because 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:26.270
 when we talk about a kilometer of ship 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.630
 I do not think a truck can hold a 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:33.250
 kilometer and of course change to 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.250
 fall to the ground and jump
