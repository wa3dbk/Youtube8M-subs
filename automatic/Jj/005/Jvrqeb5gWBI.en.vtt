the adidas dragon the shoes from the 70s
it's<00:00:17.390> primarily<00:00:18.390> based<00:00:18.690> on<00:00:18.990> a<00:00:19.020> soccer<00:00:19.380> shoe

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
it's primarily based on a soccer shoe

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.640 
it's primarily based on a soccer shoe
from<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.100> same<00:00:20.340> period<00:00:20.990> they<00:00:21.990> took<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.380> sole

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
from the same period they took the sole

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.950 
from the same period they took the sole
off<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.189> made<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.369> running<00:00:23.760> shoe<00:00:24.000> sole<00:00:24.330> very

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
off and made a running shoe sole very

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.109 
off and made a running shoe sole very
basic<00:00:25.560> but<00:00:26.340> yet<00:00:26.519> very<00:00:26.789> comfortable<00:00:29.119> nike

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
basic but yet very comfortable nike

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.179 
basic but yet very comfortable nike
makes<00:00:30.330> a<00:00:30.480> shoe<00:00:30.689> that<00:00:30.929> pretty<00:00:31.439> much<00:00:31.619> rivals

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
makes a shoe that pretty much rivals

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.520 
makes a shoe that pretty much rivals
this<00:00:32.460> called<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.420> Cortez<00:00:33.960> which<00:00:34.200> is<00:00:34.320> very

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
this called the Cortez which is very

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.190 
this called the Cortez which is very
popular<00:00:35.130> but<00:00:35.940> this<00:00:36.120> shoe<00:00:36.360> I<00:00:36.390> think<00:00:36.570> is<00:00:36.930> better

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
popular but this shoe I think is better

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.650 
popular but this shoe I think is better
it<00:00:37.620> looks<00:00:37.890> better

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
it looks better

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.920 
it looks better
I<00:00:39.719> think<00:00:40.350> it's<00:00:40.500> proportioned<00:00:41.219> better<00:00:41.690> like<00:00:42.690> on

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
I think it's proportioned better like on

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:50.889 
I think it's proportioned better like on
the<00:00:44.180> Cortez<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.420> nose<00:00:45.660> part<00:00:46.079> is<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.829> little

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:53.410 

well<00:00:51.899> what's<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.230> word<00:00:52.379> I<00:00:52.530> want<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.800> use

shallow too short you know you get what

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.369 
shallow too short you know you get what
you<00:00:58.199> get<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.469> idea<00:00:59.059> but<00:01:00.059> this<00:01:00.870> shoe<00:01:01.050> is<00:01:01.170> very

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
you get the idea but this shoe is very

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.039 
you get the idea but this shoe is very
comfortable<00:01:02.039> for<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.699> shoe<00:01:03.030> that<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.300> so<00:01:03.809> low

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
comfortable for a shoe that is so low

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.260 
comfortable for a shoe that is so low
profile<00:01:04.619> I<00:01:04.949> mean<00:01:05.189> look<00:01:05.430> how<00:01:05.700> much<00:01:07.850> space<00:01:08.850> there

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
profile I mean look how much space there

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.390 
profile I mean look how much space there
is<00:01:09.299> between<00:01:09.420> your<00:01:09.960> actual<00:01:10.260> foot<00:01:10.650> in<00:01:10.830> the

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
is between your actual foot in the

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.670 
is between your actual foot in the
ground<00:01:11.670> it's<00:01:12.000> not<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:12.750> much<00:01:12.930> at<00:01:13.110> all<00:01:13.260> it's<00:01:13.470> a

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
ground it's not that much at all it's a

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.899 
ground it's not that much at all it's a
few<00:01:14.659> millimeters<00:01:15.659> really<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.400> then<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:17.729> get

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
few millimeters really and then you get

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.609 
few millimeters really and then you get
to<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.150> back<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:18.689> you<00:01:18.750> have<00:01:18.780> this<00:01:19.080> heel<00:01:19.380> on<00:01:19.590> it

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
to the back and you have this heel on it

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.469 
to the back and you have this heel on it
which<00:01:19.860> i<00:01:20.130> think<00:01:20.490> is<00:01:20.850> where<00:01:21.000> most<00:01:21.180> of<00:01:21.360> the

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
which i think is where most of the

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.440 
which i think is where most of the
comfort<00:01:21.840> comes<00:01:22.080> from<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:23.060> don't<00:01:24.060> know<00:01:24.180> what's

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
comfort comes from I don't know what's

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.359 
comfort comes from I don't know what's
in<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.780> heel<00:01:24.990> I'm<00:01:25.500> sure<00:01:25.740> it's<00:01:25.890> not<00:01:26.009> an<00:01:26.159> air

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
in the heel I'm sure it's not an air

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.850 
in the heel I'm sure it's not an air
unit<00:01:26.990> but<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.020> think<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.380> also<00:01:28.530> would<00:01:28.829> have

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
unit but I think it also would have

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.370 
unit but I think it also would have
something<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.250> do<00:01:29.430> with<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.670> insole<00:01:30.380> which

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
something to do with the insole which

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.730 
something to do with the insole which
isn't<00:01:31.560> very<00:01:31.740> bouncy<00:01:32.250> but<00:01:32.820> um<00:01:33.350> the<00:01:34.350> shoe<00:01:34.560> is

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
isn't very bouncy but um the shoe is

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.100 
isn't very bouncy but um the shoe is
surprisingly<00:01:35.700> comfortable<00:01:36.030> for<00:01:36.930> being

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
surprisingly comfortable for being

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:43.330 
surprisingly comfortable for being
something<00:01:37.380> that's<00:01:37.700> about<00:01:39.079> 30-plus<00:01:40.079> years<00:01:40.409> old

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.550 

the<00:01:44.340> thing<00:01:44.579> I<00:01:44.670> like<00:01:44.909> about<00:01:44.939> this<00:01:45.420> one<00:01:45.689> is<00:01:45.869> I'm<00:01:46.500> a
