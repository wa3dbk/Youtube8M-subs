00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:06.720
 oops alright today are the subject 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.189
 seven worst processed foods that 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.769
 They will not let you lose weight. 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.900
 no way the processed foods 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.760
 and have the advantage of industrialized 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.230
 saving time and this makes them 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.210
 for those who have a lifestyle 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.619
 very busy and for those who do not 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.869
 like to cook 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.270
 the price is also usually cheaper 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.340
 which makes the product as much as 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.199
 irresistible 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.910
 only that at some point we will have 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.980
 than to observe the hidden consequences 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.970
 that these foods can cause to the 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.710
 our health 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.500
 it is no secret that most of these 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.120
 food passes away from being healthy 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.950
 in general they have a very low 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.590
 amount of good nutrients and a 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.899
 huge amount of calories too 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.200
 has artificial ingredients that 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.309
 can be toxic to our body 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.920
 eliminate all processed foods 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.760
 of your diet can be a good 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.440
 difficult 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.989
 however you can make a huge 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.809
 progress only by eliminating the worst 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.579
 processed foods and to help you 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.930
 I've prepared a list with the seven worst 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.600
 them for your health 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.729
 the first item are the chicken nuggets 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.429
 you might even think nerds are in 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.649
 mostly protein compounds 

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:15.359
 only typical industrial nerds 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:17.849
 they have more than 50 percent fat 

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:20.279
 and a good amount of carbohydrates 

00:01:17.849 --> 00:01:22.200
 higher than the protein and know that this 

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:24.959
 part of carbohydrates is composed of the 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.299
 the less healthy of them the majority of 

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:29.639
 ships is fried and I often get 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.889
 in eyes that contain trans fat 

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:33.810
 this type of fat causes deformities 

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:35.549
 in the membranes of our cells that 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.469
 contribute to the development of 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.700
 metabolic diseases such as diabetes 

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:40.979
 type 2 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.020
 not to mention additives whose name 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.389
 sounds like vermin as 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.130
 tertiary butyl hydroquinone 

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:48.359
 The second item on our list is the 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.759
 soft drinks 

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:52.859
 there is nothing nutritious in 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.590
 coolant absolutely nothing and are 

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:57.749
 just empty calories a can of 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.759
 coolant contains unbelievable 9 

00:01:57.749 --> 00:02:01.679
 spoons of sugar an amount 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.840
 that as well as stimulating the 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:06.270
 Intake of even more sugar can cause 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.969
 blood glucose peaks that will help you 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.500
 fattening even more in the case of 

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:12.689
 soft drinks the sweeteners 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.610
 in addition to stimulating the taste 

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:15.770
 for more baby 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.120
 the two are also associated with the risk 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.190
 of diseases 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.280
 because we still do not talk about the acidity 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.930
 of refrigerants as a consequence of ph 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.260
 usually alkaline of our organism 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.690
 can mean this creates an environment 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.490
 great for cancer cells that have 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:35.060
 more difficult to survive in a 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.470
 more alkaline environment a more acid ph 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.870
 also makes the body more vulnerable 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.790
 to viral and bacterial infections by 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.950
 weaken the natural defenses of the 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.620
 immune system 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.970
 Let's pro 3 sausage and other items 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.770
 processed meats 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.840
 the vast majority of sausages and other 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.640
 processed meats contains tons of 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.220
 sodium nitrate salt and other 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.080
 artificial flavoring preservatives and 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.090
 some cheap investments 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.980
 most people do not realize 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.170
 that the preparation of these foods is given under 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.790
 temperatures and pressure so extreme that 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.739
 any nutritional value than meat 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.940
 had at first been lost during the 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:13.250
 I prepare and have four biscuits and cakes 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.610
 This includes all variants 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.860
 Common Cookies Cookies Muffins 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:21.230
 cakes crackers cream cracker etcetera 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.060
 after all, the effect on health is practically 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.430
 same for all of them 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.260
 besides the high levels of salt 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.360
 majority of these products also contain 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.890
 trans fats 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.150
 trans fat is added because it is 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.160
 much cheaper than fats 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.950
 healthy which makes the final product 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.780
 more lucrative and also extends life 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.220
 the product on the shelves and 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.350
 improves texture 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.900
 in fact there is a whole science 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.190
 involved in improving how the use of 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.410
 trans fat and other components 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:51.230
 can help achieve the 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.310
 perfect texture for these products and the 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.650
 which is written in the tables 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.209
 is not fully reliable 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.959
 even if it says that the product has 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:02.269
 zero trans is actually allowed to 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.130
 reach the maximum trans fat level 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:06.530
 manufacturer declares that the product does not 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.690
 contains but there comes the trick 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.070
 many manufacturers simply decrease 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.350
 the amount of a portion of the food 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:14.630
 so that it reaches the magic number 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:16.400
 to find out if the product contains 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.519
 trans fat actually law the table 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.290
 find the words 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:23.210
 hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:26.630
 if they are there the product 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.080
 certainly contains fat behind and has 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.379
 five 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.849
 most breakfast cereals 

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:33.650
 you know why the vast majority of cereals 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:35.539
 are enriched with vitamins and 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:38.000
 minerals 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:39.889
 The reason is because if it was not so he 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.430
 would be so poor in nutrients that 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:44.750
 no one would buy enriched means 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.430
 that nutrients are added 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.099
 artificially during processing 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:51.050
 of food and does not mean that these 

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:52.849
 added nutrients are good 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.159
 for example cereals often 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:56.780
 offer a form of vitamin D that does not 

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:57.819
 is easily used by our 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.379
 body 

00:04:57.819 --> 00:05:01.909
 not to mention the amount of sugar 

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:04.250
 that most of the grains containing 

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:05.150
 in itself the cereal was made especially 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.919
 of corn 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.810
 you can bet it 's a type of corn 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:10.550
 genetically modified because this 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.310
 corn is much cheaper and increases the 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:15.440
 profits the risks of cancer caused by 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:17.150
 this type of corn were not discarded 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.879
 completely deeper studies 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.930
 end up suffering threats from 

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:23.870
 biotechnology 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:25.219
 in doubt it is best not to risk the 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.590
 item 6 of our list may be 

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:30.110
 surprising are the cereal bars 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.159
 the marketing of these cereal bars is 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:32.779
 well winning 

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:34.639
 they are presented as foods 

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:36.500
 exceptionally healthy when in the 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:38.930
 truth is the opposite 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:40.879
 that means you tend to eat 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:43.279
 more thinking that you are ingesting something 

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:45.469
 convenient healthy tasting when the 

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:47.659
 truth is very far from it 

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:49.729
 almost every brand of cereal bar has 

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:51.949
 amount of sugar in the 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:53.930
 more diverse forms for example molasses 

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:55.550
 from cana 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:57.409
 you should always be alert because 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.509
 seems healthy but not too much 

00:05:57.409 --> 00:06:01.250
 different from eating a sweet a chocolate 

00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:02.990
 especially if you believe that 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:05.210
 is eating something that is not fattening and 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:07.400
 ends up exaggerating and they also contain 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:08.960
 many fats, especially trans fats. 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.580
 sodium 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:13.639
 we reached the last item on our list 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:15.500
 are sauces ready for salads 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:17.270
 most of these sauces contain large 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.190
 amounts of sugar because it is a form 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:20.419
 easy manufacturer could give 

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:23.419
 consistency and flavor 

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:25.219
 products at a very low cost 

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:26.690
 many also contain trans fat and 

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:28.430
 other additives 

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:30.199
 another factor that makes these sauces 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:32.479
 unhealthy is that we tend not to 

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:34.569
 think about what they contain when 

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:37.219
 we put ourselves in our food 

00:06:34.569 --> 00:06:39.500
 a fresh and healthy salad can 

00:06:37.219 --> 00:06:40.870
 quickly become a caloric bomb 

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:43.430
 if we add these 

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:45.050
 a good way to handle it is 

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:47.030
 prepare their own seasonings and 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:50.150
 because you control the 

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:52.460
 ingredients to give store sauce 

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:54.860
 homemade salad or ketchup at least 

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:56.900
 for a week in your fridge 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:58.880
 completing one of the most 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:00.680
 important for a healthier life 

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.450
 is to eliminate or at least reduce 

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:04.960
 substantially the food 

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:07.160
 processed that you may generate 

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.810
 It is also important that you read 

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.970
 carefully the nutritional tables 

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:12.800
 when shopping and not 

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:14.870
 depend only on what is said in the 

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:16.940
 front of packaging 

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:18.590
 Finally, it is always good to remember that when 

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:21.260
 the food contains addictive substances 

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:22.910
 like sugar and that causes a texture and 

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:25.820
 flavor are as intense as fat 

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:27.140
 trans and use matzah in the face of 

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:29.270
 that customers end up returning to 

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:32.450
 consume more and lose their
