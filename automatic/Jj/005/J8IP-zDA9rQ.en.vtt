looked<00:03:09.840> good<00:03:10.110> like<00:03:10.410> the<00:03:10.530> magnet<00:03:10.920> but<00:03:11.820> she's

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
looked good like the magnet but she's

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.250 
looked good like the magnet but she's
loving<00:03:12.150> it<00:03:12.180> appears<00:03:12.510> and<00:03:12.690> she<00:03:12.780> likes<00:03:12.989> it's

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
only thing that sucks about nose

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:27.380 
only thing that sucks about nose
piercings<00:03:25.590> is<00:03:25.890> they'll<00:03:26.579> fall<00:03:26.820> out<00:03:26.970> sometimes

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
piercings is they'll fall out sometimes

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.150 
piercings is they'll fall out sometimes

three years and they still close up
super<00:03:35.640> easily<00:03:35.850> because<00:03:36.269> of<00:03:36.390> the<00:03:36.450> cartilage

that<00:04:13.290> one<00:04:13.470> didn't<00:04:13.799> really<00:04:14.040> hurt<00:04:14.250> but<00:04:14.579> um<00:04:14.959> it

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
that one didn't really hurt but um it

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:17.300 
that one didn't really hurt but um it
was<00:04:16.079> definitely<00:04:16.260> unexpected<00:04:16.530> because<00:04:17.070> she's

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
was definitely unexpected because she's

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.539 
was definitely unexpected because she's
like<00:04:17.459> one<00:04:17.699> and<00:04:17.940> the

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
like one and the

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:21.300 
like one and the
stabs<00:04:18.789> at<00:04:19.000> 30<00:04:19.180> like<00:04:19.389> 23<00:04:19.810> I'm<00:04:19.989> like<00:04:20.289> oh<00:04:20.470> it<00:04:20.979> can't

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
stabs at 30 like 23 I'm like oh it can't

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.029 
stabs at 30 like 23 I'm like oh it can't
breathe<00:04:21.669> um<00:04:22.330> but<00:04:22.990> I<00:04:23.050> think<00:04:23.319> that<00:04:23.500> one<00:04:23.680> hurt<00:04:23.830> the

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:24.039 
breathe um but I think that one hurt the

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:25.529 
breathe um but I think that one hurt the
most<00:04:24.220> because<00:04:24.430> there's<00:04:24.669> much<00:04:24.849> thicker<00:04:25.180> skin

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:25.539 
most because there's much thicker skin

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:27.800 
most because there's much thicker skin
and<00:04:25.750> then<00:04:25.930> my<00:04:26.110> nose<00:04:26.169> and<00:04:26.650> then<00:04:26.770> my<00:04:26.949> ears<00:04:27.220> and

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.390 
and then my nose and then my ears and
