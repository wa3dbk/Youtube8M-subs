00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:12.330
 hello to all bq smartphones 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.870
 they release 4g and they do it in a big way what 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.449
 make with this new aquarium the 54 g a 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.810
 device whose only novelty is not the 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:24.330
 4g but also has a new 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.000
 screen technology a sensor 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.970
 improved and they have also implemented by 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.859
 first time on these devices 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.440
 Qualcomm processor you want to know more 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.500
 Come on, let's go with them 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.500
 ah 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.770
 we start with the 5-inch screen 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:45.040
 that has full gps technology the 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.720
 mission this is good because this is 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.360
 that the space between 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.699
 the screen and the crystal to offer 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.839
 a better user experience too 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:57.100
 implements quantum color plus technology 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:59.500
 to get a range spectrum of 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.170
 wider and more reliable colors in 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.809
 practical terms what we have is a 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.550
 hd screen that offers very good 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:10.110
 results both in terms of 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.110
 viewed as answers 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:18.600
 your camera has a 13 sensor 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:22.350
 megapixels are ibex and exmor rs have 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.630
 an opening of f1 with 8 this what 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.400
 means is that he is able to do 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.220
 good photos even in conditions of 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.430
 Low light improves in image quality and 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.700
 in the answer offering recording of 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.130
 video in full hd format and as already 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.770
 we are used to have a 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.440
 lots of options that we can modify 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:48.410
 in the menu like for example the 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.410
 exposition of smooth et cetera etcetera 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.410
 another of the differentiating points is 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.540
 that for the first time a 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:02.430
 qualcomm processor in this case the 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:05.520
 qualcomm snapdragon 410 quad core at 53 a 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.399
 1.2 gigahertz this new processor 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.979
 offers more stability in 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.710
 communications and better performance not 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:17.790
 only of the processor but also of the 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:20.070
 2,850 milliamp battery this what 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.709
 what it will do is that with a fair use 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.690
 intensive battery hurts us one day 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.209
 complete without problems we will not have 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.190
 to worry about and if our use is a 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:33.630
 little less intensive can reach us 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:36.420
 to last up to two days and eye 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:41.450
 they say that in a very short time it arrives 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.450
 the olive tree right now android 4 points 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:49.970
 the 54 g aquarium continues to maintain 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.950
 dual sim dual sim that by the way I know 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.739
 that you know they have all the 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.269
 bq smartphones but this time has 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:59.569
 an extra and that is that it has 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:01.910
 4g connectivity and in fact 4g in both 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:03.290
 slots but eye can not be used the 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.230
 4g with the two slots so 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.420
 simultaneous this connectivity will make 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.780
 we can move at full speed 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.790
 the internet paths these four 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.290
 points are complemented with 16 gigas of 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.130
 expandable storage through 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.560
 microsd card 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.730
 whose tray is up here and as 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:27.760
 You see there is a difference with respect to 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:29.740
 the previous 5 and is that the previous and 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.360
 5 we lift a cap and do not put in the 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.730
 slot this one directly has the 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:37.000
 tray like micro sim cards 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:39.490
 also has a ram memory of 1 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.560
 gig and of course with all the 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:42.880
 connectivity and with all the sensors to 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.880
 lucila have us accustomed 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.410
 smartphones and the first steps 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.870
 a lot of information from this 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.970
 device and of all the rest 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:55.690
 bbq you can find them on the web my bq 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:59.380
 and me and this is the contents of the box 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:01.080
 of the aquarium is 54 g a smartphone with 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.700
 an excellent relationship 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.130
 quality-price see you in the next 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.930
 video 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:10.150
 fucks planners 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.349
 Well, do not look at me like that, what's wrong? 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.830
 you have seen the muncipales of the 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:15.910
 church 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.910
 and you are already observing
