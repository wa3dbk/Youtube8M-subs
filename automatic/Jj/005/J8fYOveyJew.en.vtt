00:00:03.709 --> 00:00:12.230
 I bring here a video tutorial of how 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:15.829
 install on ps3 media server what good 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:18.920
 what is it to connect, that is, your base 

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:20.870
 of data from the computer to your play is 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.260
 say for example the photos you have 

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:28.070
 computer videos and everything can connect it 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:31.190
 to your playstation good first of all 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:35.650
 we have to go bonus to your browser 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:35.650
 use you always usually 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:42.000
 well i will know 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.000
 and we put 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.420
 half 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.410
 ps3 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:09.700
 ps3 let's go back to any of these is 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.700
 free quiet 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:19.330
 good what do you download good me in my case 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.480
 I already have it downloaded 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:25.420
 it's a waste of time not to download 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:28.960
 again once here download 6 all 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:32.890
 the steps is very simple all though 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:38.000
 let's say it and well once downloaded 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:40.250
 when you open the s3 media server 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.280
 you have to have of course internet 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:46.520
 in your place and it will not work 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:48.710
 well I think I do not know 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.250
 come on and I think I think not that not 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.500
 you need internet everyone knows 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.260
 good crediting with the ps3 right now 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.630
 I play it I have it disconnected but if 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:01.080
 I connect it, I hope it's that I'm going to 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.080
 connect 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.630
 if I connect it 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:10.119
 is now good of the error because it is 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:15.340
 disconnected 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:19.230
 but the moment you connect it and open 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.230
 there will be 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.740
 will have identified that we say a dam 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.140
 as you can see now that just 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:29.330
 turn on my play I found it good 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.780
 is here and here in this program and not 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:35.240
 you have to touch anything is worth and well a 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.770
 Once you have done well this is not 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.360
 you have to do nothing, you just have 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:42.140
 than plug it in when you have to start the 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:45.490
 program is to open it open the play and os 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:48.510
 it 's all good will come out the better play 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:48.510
 and good once 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:56.220
 had this go to the play and good 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:59.880
 will leave a section that will put you to ps3 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:03.000
 half servel media server and your 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:06.120
 user in parentheses and good and from 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.420
 there you give the icon of this where the 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.360
 icon of this console is not and once 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.819
 you give him 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:17.400
 good you choose the section if you want is 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.680
 say you know that the beach and in three 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:23.459
 basic sections that are music photos and 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:26.760
 video as well as on the computer because it 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:31.710
 you give photos for example and you give ps3 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:34.290

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.000
 would be your wallet 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:41.730
 computer is seen I think it will be called 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.730

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:47.580
 then you give to users 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.680
 OK 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.550

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.590

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.470

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:02.780
