00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
know it's fun the character selection is

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.910 
know it's fun the character selection is
also<00:01:59.969> pretty<00:02:00.090> good<00:02:00.299> there's<00:02:00.630> in<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.530> demo

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
also pretty good there's in the demo

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.289 
also pretty good there's in the demo
there's<00:02:02.130> a<00:02:02.189> small<00:02:02.520> selection<00:02:02.670> of<00:02:02.939> characters

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
there's a small selection of characters

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.639 
there's a small selection of characters
but<00:02:03.479> each<00:02:03.719> one<00:02:03.960> has<00:02:04.290> its<00:02:04.320> own<00:02:04.469> little

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
but each one has its own little

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.969 
but each one has its own little
personality<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:05.399> assume<00:02:06.299> that<00:02:06.450> in<00:02:06.570> c3<00:02:07.079> we<00:02:07.860> have

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
personality I assume that in c3 we have

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.130 
personality I assume that in c3 we have
been<00:02:08.129> told<00:02:08.310> yet<00:02:08.520> but<00:02:08.759> I'm<00:02:09.390> assuming<00:02:09.780> that<00:02:09.899> it

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
been told yet but I'm assuming that it

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.730 
been told yet but I'm assuming that it
will<00:02:10.319> have<00:02:10.500> a<00:02:11.989> personal

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
will have a personal

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.640 
will have a personal
customization<00:02:14.400> character<00:02:14.940> area<00:02:15.470> this<00:02:16.470> game

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
customization character area this game

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.770 
customization character area this game
is<00:02:16.800> great<00:02:16.980> with<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.430> graphics<00:02:17.940> now<00:02:18.060> and<00:02:18.300> also

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
is great with the graphics now and also

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.720 
is great with the graphics now and also
the<00:02:18.870> cutscenes<00:02:19.290> are<00:02:19.410> pretty<00:02:20.100> well<00:02:20.190> made<00:02:20.490> and

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
the cutscenes are pretty well made and

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.880 
the cutscenes are pretty well made and
they're<00:02:20.880> funny<00:02:21.150> and<00:02:21.260> not<00:02:22.260> too<00:02:22.380> hard<00:02:22.560> to<00:02:22.620> get<00:02:22.770> by

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
they basically took the skate one

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:30.950 
they basically took the skate one
feeling<00:02:29.850> which<00:02:30.090> was<00:02:30.210> missing<00:02:30.510> a<00:02:30.570> skate<00:02:30.810> too

another feature showing right now the
new<00:02:47.430> hall<00:02:47.700> of<00:02:47.850> meat<00:02:48.030> I'm<00:02:48.660> not<00:02:48.810> sure<00:02:48.900> if<00:02:48.960> it's

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
new hall of meat I'm not sure if it's

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.180 
new hall of meat I'm not sure if it's
called<00:02:49.200> hauled<00:02:49.380> me<00:02:49.500> anymore<00:02:49.830> i<00:02:49.860> think<00:02:50.100> it's

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
called hauled me anymore i think it's

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.910 
called hauled me anymore i think it's
like<00:02:50.310> not<00:02:50.970> at<00:02:51.210> all<00:02:51.330> meet<00:02:51.510> nevermind<00:02:51.780> but<00:02:52.590> it's

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
like not at all meet nevermind but it's

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.920 
like not at all meet nevermind but it's
amazing<00:02:53.310> and<00:02:53.430> there's<00:02:54.270> a<00:02:54.360> new<00:02:54.480> targeting

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
amazing and there's a new targeting

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.750 
amazing and there's a new targeting
system<00:02:55.290> and<00:02:55.590> the<00:02:55.890> physics<00:02:56.250> are<00:02:56.370> just<00:02:56.400> so

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
system and the physics are just so

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.510 
system and the physics are just so
advanced<00:02:57.240> now<00:02:57.360> it's<00:02:58.110> it's<00:02:58.560> beyond<00:02:58.980> fun<00:02:59.280> it's

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
advanced now it's it's beyond fun it's

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.420 
advanced now it's it's beyond fun it's
just<00:02:59.760> so<00:03:00.410> advanced<00:03:01.410> and<00:03:01.560> far<00:03:02.130> ahead<00:03:02.250> of<00:03:02.340> its

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
just so advanced and far ahead of its

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.730 
just so advanced and far ahead of its
time<00:03:02.520> that<00:03:02.940> it's<00:03:03.330> really<00:03:03.600> great<00:03:03.780> and<00:03:03.990> keep<00:03:04.620> in

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
time that it's really great and keep in

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.230 
time that it's really great and keep in
mind<00:03:04.890> this<00:03:05.010> is<00:03:05.070> only<00:03:05.310> the<00:03:05.400> demo<00:03:05.670> I<00:03:05.880> mean<00:03:06.060> it's

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
mind this is only the demo I mean it's

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.720 
mind this is only the demo I mean it's
not<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:06.810> whole<00:03:07.020> game<00:03:07.230> yet<00:03:07.470> so<00:03:07.740> if<00:03:08.550> you've

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
not the whole game yet so if you've

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.850 
not the whole game yet so if you've
already<00:03:08.850> played<00:03:09.030> this<00:03:09.210> game<00:03:09.390> and<00:03:09.630> the<00:03:10.410> demo<00:03:10.710> I

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
already played this game and the demo I

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.360 
already played this game and the demo I
mean<00:03:11.040> it's<00:03:11.220> it's<00:03:11.580> just<00:03:11.850> remarkable<00:03:12.500> see<00:03:13.500> I<00:03:13.740> see

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
mean it's it's just remarkable see I see

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.430 
mean it's it's just remarkable see I see
here<00:03:14.640> the<00:03:14.970> new<00:03:15.240> hauled<00:03:15.450> me<00:03:15.600> system<00:03:15.900> is<00:03:16.050> way

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
here the new hauled me system is way

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.750 
here the new hauled me system is way
more<00:03:16.620> in<00:03:16.740> real<00:03:16.920> time<00:03:17.160> instead<00:03:17.490> of<00:03:17.550> showing

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
more in real time instead of showing

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.610 
more in real time instead of showing
your<00:03:17.940> results<00:03:18.420> afterwards<00:03:18.810> you<00:03:19.320> can<00:03:19.410> see<00:03:19.560> you

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
your results afterwards you can see you

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.200 
your results afterwards you can see you
a<00:03:19.680> bone<00:03:19.830> to<00:03:19.950> break<00:03:20.160> right<00:03:20.490> when<00:03:20.910> they<00:03:21.060> break

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:21.210 
a bone to break right when they break

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.050 
a bone to break right when they break
it's<00:03:21.540> pretty<00:03:22.170> amazing<00:03:22.550> all<00:03:23.550> right<00:03:23.670> back<00:03:23.940> to

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
it's pretty amazing all right back to

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.000 
it's pretty amazing all right back to
the<00:03:24.150> skating<00:03:24.480> which<00:03:24.870> is<00:03:25.050> probably<00:03:25.500> my<00:03:25.710> part<00:03:25.950> of

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
the skating which is probably my part of

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.700 
the skating which is probably my part of
this<00:03:26.070> whole<00:03:26.220> thing<00:03:27.170> skating<00:03:28.170> in<00:03:28.230> this<00:03:28.320> game<00:03:28.500> is

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:28.710 
this whole thing skating in this game is

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.520 
this whole thing skating in this game is
gotten<00:03:29.160> easier<00:03:29.790> and<00:03:30.330> harder<00:03:30.690> depends<00:03:31.470> on

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
gotten easier and harder depends on

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:32.930 
gotten easier and harder depends on
what's<00:03:31.770> difficult<00:03:31.950> to<00:03:32.220> you<00:03:32.280> choose<00:03:32.490> which<00:03:32.790> is
