00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.660
 good all attached to a new video 

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:06.490
 well I'm going to clarify a little bit of this 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.530
 all this story make you a little 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.630
 summary of everything good you know ago 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.190
 a few days it leaked that it was good 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.469
 have one had campaigns of 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.059
 Call of duty ghosts advertising and 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:17.320
 Well basically on May 1st 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.480
 it would be revealed 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.550
 surely today something is going to leak 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.289
 and something has leaked and well neither more nor 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.689
 unless it seems to be one of the posters 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:27.609
 or at least advertising or those that 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:28.930
 they give you to reserve a game we do not know 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:30.939
 if this propaganda will come too 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.800
 to Spain or what but for now everything 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.960
 I say it's a rumor, you do not have to take it as 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.630
 something totally one hundred percent serious 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.340
 yes it is true that by 99 percent 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.890
 it seems real everything seems real the poster and 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.750
 everything since in fact the poster 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.789
 that teaches us what he taught us yesterday 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.590
 the page of call of dutty dotcom in 

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:48.670
 with the finished image and such you already know 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.520
 they started doing a kind of 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.590
 teaser with all the twitter photos and 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.449
 of facebook that sent people and 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.399
 good in good shape image that is 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:59.289
 basically the same image that you have 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:01.660
 in the description or the same image as 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:03.430
 is the poster this good is a poster of 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.170
 double face on the first side we can 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.210
 find a face of a 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.729
 it was basically a white skull 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.100
 pretty pretty cool and such and that in 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:14.350
 the corner puts we are all we got that 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.750
 would come to mean as we are all 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.750
 what we have and basically basically the 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.729
 another face what we what we what 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.740
 It puts us hope that I lost I 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:25.390
 lost the good page basically what 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.640
 that puts the other side of that call of 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.770
 duty ghosts and good the typical cover 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.149
 that had been filtering a few years ago 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.000
 days the cover of what possibly 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:38.110
 will be the game not a man we put a 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.490
 kind of mask in good you have to 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.649
 say more of this also puts the date 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:45.310
 of launch that would be basically the 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:48.159
 November 5th falls on Tuesday I do not know 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.990
 if that date will be real or that it is possible 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.330
 that as I say it is possible that this 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.789
 poster yes that is real as I say 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.860
 and nothing in the description you have all 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:58.420
 the pictures of all this and such we are 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.690
 waiting to see if a trailer comes out 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.280
 today or tomorrow it is very sure that it will come out and 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.049
 well we'll see to see if they come out and if it comes out or 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.270
 not because how are we going to stay 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:09.069
 very bad and I guess I do not think this 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.539
 for an advertising campaign or 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.640
 reserved a game that has not yet 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.750
 been ad 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.580
 because I guess this kind of thing 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.590
 when you book a game it costs you a 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.880
 little more to take you to this poster and 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:24.040
 well nothing more kids this has been 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.040
 all in the next video for next
