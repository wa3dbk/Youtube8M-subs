00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
what happens in these kind of

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.050 
what happens in these kind of
transitional<00:00:49.830> pieces<00:00:50.040> and<00:00:50.460> they're<00:00:50.910> very

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:51.060 
transitional pieces and they're very

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.520 
transitional pieces and they're very
old-school<00:00:51.480> they're<00:00:51.720> very<00:00:51.870> reminiscent<00:00:52.230> and

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
old-school they're very reminiscent and

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.080 
old-school they're very reminiscent and
kind<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.860> old<00:00:53.040> Mortal<00:00:53.310> Kombat<00:00:53.670> game<00:00:53.850> so<00:00:54.030> I

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
kind of the old Mortal Kombat game so I

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.490 
kind of the old Mortal Kombat game so I
just<00:00:54.270> wanted<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.600> add<00:00:54.750> another<00:00:54.930> layer<00:00:55.320> of

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
just wanted to add another layer of

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.010 
just wanted to add another layer of
complexity<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.970> it<00:00:57.000> get<00:00:57.390> its<00:00:57.540> iteration

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
complexity to it get its iteration

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.420 
complexity to it get its iteration
because<00:00:58.320> that's<00:00:58.530> what<00:00:58.680> we<00:00:58.740> can<00:00:58.860> do<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.190> right

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
because that's what we can do it right

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.830 
because that's what we can do it right
right<00:00:59.610> and<00:00:59.850> as<00:01:00.120> you're<00:01:00.329> falling<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:00.690> also

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
right and as you're falling you also

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.900 
right and as you're falling you also
have<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.260> ability<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.620> fill<00:01:02.160> up<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.400> meter<00:01:02.820> on

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
have the ability to fill up a meter on

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.579 
have the ability to fill up a meter on
the<00:01:03.060> side<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.360> screen<00:01:03.570> which<00:01:03.810> if<00:01:03.989> you<00:01:04.170> fill<00:01:04.470> it

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
the side of screen which if you fill it

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.170 
the side of screen which if you fill it
to<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.769> right<00:01:04.920> level<00:01:05.100> you<00:01:05.309> can<00:01:05.579> pull<00:01:06.060> off<00:01:06.150> a

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
to the right level you can pull off a

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.090 
to the right level you can pull off a
super<00:01:06.630> yeah<00:01:06.990> every<00:01:07.350> character<00:01:07.710> is<00:01:07.770> gonna<00:01:07.920> have
