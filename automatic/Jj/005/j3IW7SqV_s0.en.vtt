00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.840 
especially not me as part of the legacy
of<00:02:24.930> spider-man<00:02:25.290> those<00:02:25.860> films<00:02:26.220> means<00:02:26.430> so<00:02:26.670> much

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
of spider-man those films means so much

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.300 
of spider-man those films means so much
to<00:02:26.910> me<00:02:27.150> and<00:02:27.330> Toby's<00:02:27.690> performance<00:02:28.200> means<00:02:29.130> so

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
to me and Toby's performance means so

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.160 
to me and Toby's performance means so
much<00:02:29.490> to<00:02:29.550> me<00:02:29.760> I'd<00:02:29.880> look<00:02:30.660> in<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:30.870> mirror<00:02:31.050> and

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
much to me I'd look in the mirror and

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.140 
much to me I'd look in the mirror and
practice<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:31.830> lines<00:02:31.950> that<00:02:32.250> he<00:02:32.340> would<00:02:32.460> give<00:02:32.670> to

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
practice the lines that he would give to

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.610 
practice the lines that he would give to
try<00:02:33.330> to<00:02:33.390> match<00:02:33.570> up<00:02:33.600> I<00:02:33.930> never<00:02:34.140> could<00:02:36.320> so<00:02:37.320> I<00:02:37.350> feel

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
try to match up I never could so I feel

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.870 
try to match up I never could so I feel
like<00:02:38.570> comic<00:02:39.570> books<00:02:39.600> and<00:02:40.370> comic<00:02:41.370> book<00:02:41.490> films

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
like comic books and comic book films

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.190 
like comic books and comic book films
are<00:02:42.240> are<00:02:43.340> modern<00:02:44.340> myths<00:02:44.550> and<00:02:44.850> I<00:02:45.660> think<00:02:46.050> they

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
are are modern myths and I think they

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.190 
are are modern myths and I think they
hold<00:02:46.470> universal<00:02:47.430> themes<00:02:47.670> about<00:02:48.030> being<00:02:48.600> human

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
hold universal themes about being human

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.260 
hold universal themes about being human
that<00:02:49.910> we<00:02:50.910> need<00:02:51.120> to<00:02:51.470> be<00:02:52.470> reminded<00:02:52.950> of<00:02:53.250> over<00:02:54.150> and

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
that we need to be reminded of over and

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:55.610 
that we need to be reminded of over and
over<00:02:54.480> and<00:02:54.570> over<00:02:54.660> and<00:02:54.930> over<00:02:55.140> and<00:02:55.200> over<00:02:55.470> and<00:02:55.530> over

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
over and over and over and over and over

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.590 
over and over and over and over and over
again<00:02:55.890> and<00:02:56.190> I<00:02:56.760> think<00:02:56.970> this<00:02:57.120> struggle<00:02:57.480> that

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
again and I think this struggle that

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.780 
again and I think this struggle that
Peter<00:02:58.260> Parker<00:02:58.440> has<00:02:58.770> of<00:02:59.010> being<00:02:59.190> a<00:02:59.280> normal<00:02:59.490> kid

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
Peter Parker has of being a normal kid

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.190 
Peter Parker has of being a normal kid
like<00:03:00.000> everyone<00:03:00.510> that's<00:03:00.690> why<00:03:00.810> everyone<00:03:01.050> can

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
like everyone that's why everyone can

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.510 
like everyone that's why everyone can
relate<00:03:01.410> to<00:03:01.530> him<00:03:01.620> because<00:03:01.770> he<00:03:01.830> is<00:03:02.100> all<00:03:02.280> of<00:03:02.310> us

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
relate to him because he is all of us

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.220 
relate to him because he is all of us
he's<00:03:03.030> no<00:03:03.210> different<00:03:03.390> to<00:03:03.630> any<00:03:03.660> of<00:03:03.930> us<00:03:04.020> and

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
he's no different to any of us and

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.890 
he's no different to any of us and
that's<00:03:04.320> why<00:03:04.520> he's<00:03:05.520> the<00:03:05.730> most<00:03:05.910> to<00:03:06.480> me<00:03:06.630> the<00:03:06.780> most

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
that's why he's the most to me the most

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.070 
that's why he's the most to me the most
important<00:03:07.290> superhero<00:03:07.790> and<00:03:08.790> III<00:03:09.480> think<00:03:09.750> it's

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
important superhero and III think it's

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.590 
important superhero and III think it's
just<00:03:10.320> I<00:03:10.590> think<00:03:11.370> I<00:03:11.700> think<00:03:11.970> I<00:03:12.120> I<00:03:12.150> mean<00:03:12.450> I<00:03:12.480> I
