this<00:00:21.420> cover<00:00:25.070> we'll<00:00:26.070> see<00:00:26.250> what<00:00:26.430> happens<00:00:26.550> today

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
this cover we'll see what happens today

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:34.729 
this cover we'll see what happens today
so<00:00:29.220> it's<00:00:29.400> still<00:00:29.609> not<00:00:29.789> 1030<00:00:33.200> coming<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.320> us<00:00:34.469> now

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
so it's still not 1030 coming to us now

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.410 
so it's still not 1030 coming to us now
look<00:00:35.100> at<00:00:35.219> me<00:00:35.340> so<00:00:35.489> this<00:00:35.550> stuff<00:00:35.730> is<00:00:35.850> moving<00:00:36.210> east

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
look at me so this stuff is moving east

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.420 
look at me so this stuff is moving east
early<00:00:36.809> as<00:00:37.020> I'm<00:00:37.200> I<00:00:37.410> guess<00:00:37.649> we'd<00:00:37.829> call<00:00:38.040> it<00:00:38.070> as<00:00:38.280> a

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
early as I'm I guess we'd call it as a

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.650 
early as I'm I guess we'd call it as a
mass<00:00:39.920> rotate<00:00:40.920> over<00:00:41.160> towards<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.520> west<00:00:41.700> here

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.229 

that's<00:00:45.660> looking<00:00:45.870> east<00:00:46.850> kind<00:00:47.850> of<00:00:47.910> Road<00:00:48.059> change

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
that's looking east kind of Road change

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.930 
that's looking east kind of Road change
of<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.510> South<00:00:48.750> there<00:00:49.190> so<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.309> sun's<00:00:50.550> just<00:00:50.730> off

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
of the South there so the sun's just off

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.529 
of the South there so the sun's just off
to<00:00:51.090> my<00:00:51.210> right<00:00:51.239> looking<00:00:52.110> easterly<00:00:53.539> nothing

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
to my right looking easterly nothing

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:02.689 
to my right looking easterly nothing
then<00:00:54.690> we<00:00:54.780> start<00:00:55.020> getting<00:00:55.110> this<00:00:55.320> pattern<00:01:01.699> then

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
then we start getting this pattern then

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.710 
then we start getting this pattern then
we<00:01:02.820> can<00:01:02.940> rotate<00:01:03.120> around<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.719> south<00:01:03.960> here

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
we can rotate around to the south here

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.539 
we can rotate around to the south here
now<00:01:06.720> this<00:01:07.080> way<00:01:07.350> with<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.619> son<00:01:07.890> so<00:01:08.100> bad<00:01:08.310> it's<00:01:08.460> just

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
now this way with a son so bad it's just

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.649 
now this way with a son so bad it's just
a<00:01:08.930> mush<00:01:09.930> of<00:01:10.140> haze<00:01:10.670> looking<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:12.030> easterly

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
a mush of haze looking the easterly

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.149 
a mush of haze looking the easterly
where<00:01:12.810> we<00:01:12.900> had<00:01:13.049> nothing<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.560> know<00:01:13.619> 10<00:01:13.860> minutes

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
where we had nothing you know 10 minutes

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.940 
where we had nothing you know 10 minutes
ago<00:01:14.400> see<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.259> 1020<00:01:16.259> that<00:01:16.409> looks<00:01:16.530> anything

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
ago see it 1020 that looks anything

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:23.390 
ago see it 1020 that looks anything
there<00:01:21.229> there's<00:01:22.229> your<00:01:22.350> patch<00:01:22.740> of<00:01:22.950> blue<00:01:23.130> his<00:01:23.280> way

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.039 

that<00:01:45.549> was<00:01:45.700> looking<00:01:46.030> north<00:01:46.270> westerly<00:01:46.750> and<00:01:46.960> now

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:47.049 
that was looking north westerly and now

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:58.639 
that was looking north westerly and now
we're<00:01:47.229> looking<00:01:47.500> south<00:01:47.799> westerly<00:01:57.270> looking

northerly I mean westerly can you see a

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.529 
northerly I mean westerly can you see a
distinct<00:02:04.509> line<00:02:05.759> associated<00:02:06.759> with<00:02:07.060> each<00:02:07.270> one

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:07.539 
distinct line associated with each one

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:11.130 
distinct line associated with each one
of<00:02:07.569> those<00:02:07.750> thick<00:02:08.200> bands<00:02:09.720> it's<00:02:10.720> hard<00:02:11.019> to

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
of those thick bands it's hard to

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.110 
of those thick bands it's hard to
describe<00:02:11.410> there's<00:02:11.830> a<00:02:11.890> distinct<00:02:12.550> singular

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
describe there's a distinct singular

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:19.920 
describe there's a distinct singular
line<00:02:13.620> in<00:02:15.480> connection<00:02:16.480> with<00:02:16.660> these<00:02:17.290> bands<00:02:18.930> and

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
line in connection with these bands and

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.420 
line in connection with these bands and
I'm<00:02:20.049> recording<00:02:20.410> this<00:02:20.620> every<00:02:20.950> couple<00:02:21.099> minutes

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
I'm recording this every couple minutes

I'm recording this every couple minutes
right<00:02:21.730> now<00:02:24.780> to<00:02:25.780> see<00:02:26.049> if<00:02:26.080> those<00:02:26.459> distinct<00:02:27.459> bands

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
right now to see if those distinct bands

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.900 
right now to see if those distinct bands
show<00:02:28.209> up<00:02:28.390> as<00:02:28.750> close<00:02:29.019> up<00:02:29.319> it's<00:02:29.470> just<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:30.670> dirt

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
show up as close up it's just the dirt

you see that streaking I don't see that

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.580 
you see that streaking I don't see that
no<00:02:45.640> single<00:02:45.970> tight<00:02:46.390> bands<00:02:46.780> I<00:02:47.109> was<00:02:47.260> trying<00:02:47.530> to

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
no single tight bands I was trying to

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.860 
no single tight bands I was trying to

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
back to see how accurate the

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.720 
back to see how accurate the
reproduction<00:03:11.380> isn't<00:03:11.650> this<00:03:11.739> is<00:03:12.370> pretty<00:03:12.639> much

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
reproduction isn't this is pretty much

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:18.990 
reproduction isn't this is pretty much
what<00:03:12.850> I'm<00:03:13.150> hopefully<00:03:14.109> that<00:03:14.260> will<00:03:14.350> come<00:03:14.560> up<00:03:18.000> all

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
what I'm hopefully that will come up all

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.590 
what I'm hopefully that will come up all
right<00:03:19.209> so<00:03:19.329> now<00:03:19.480> it's<00:03:19.660> 1040<00:03:21.150> and<00:03:22.150> sort<00:03:22.480> of<00:03:22.569> West

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
right so now it's 1040 and sort of West

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.500 
right so now it's 1040 and sort of West
sort<00:03:25.600> of<00:03:25.750> sort<00:03:26.290> of<00:03:26.319> smearing<00:03:26.620> together<00:03:27.010> now<00:03:27.510> so

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
sort of sort of smearing together now so

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.500 
sort of sort of smearing together now so
this<00:03:28.660> is<00:03:28.810> what<00:03:29.230> you're<00:03:29.380> saying
