00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
how can I apply at home

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.969 
how can I apply at home
well<00:02:08.240> you<00:02:08.539> mean<00:02:08.720> you<00:02:08.929> can<00:02:09.050> use<00:02:09.200> your<00:02:09.380> fingers<00:02:09.800> I

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
well you mean you can use your fingers I

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.380 
well you mean you can use your fingers I
don't<00:02:10.160> know<00:02:10.280> what<00:02:10.610> do<00:02:10.700> you<00:02:10.789> normally<00:02:10.880> do<00:02:11.209> two

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
don't know what do you normally do two

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.500 
don't know what do you normally do two
or<00:02:11.569> sponges<00:02:12.230> or<00:02:12.560> you<00:02:12.950> do<00:02:13.160> you<00:02:13.790> can<00:02:14.030> do<00:02:14.270> that

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
or sponges or you do you can do that

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.040 
or sponges or you do you can do that
yeah<00:02:14.840> and<00:02:15.560> in<00:02:15.950> fact<00:02:16.130> some<00:02:16.900> foundations<00:02:17.900> are

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
yeah and in fact some foundations are

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.420 
yeah and in fact some foundations are
easier<00:02:18.440> to<00:02:18.500> apply<00:02:18.770> the<00:02:18.890> things<00:02:19.160> because<00:02:19.370> they

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
easier to apply the things because they

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.790 
easier to apply the things because they
warm<00:02:19.700> the<00:02:20.180> foundational<00:02:20.840> and<00:02:21.290> it<00:02:21.410> does<00:02:21.560> go<00:02:21.770> on

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
warm the foundational and it does go on

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.850 
warm the foundational and it does go on
nicely<00:02:22.730> I<00:02:23.209> just<00:02:24.110> use<00:02:24.260> brushes<00:02:24.500> because<00:02:24.680> i

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
nicely I just use brushes because i

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.220 
nicely I just use brushes because i
think<00:02:24.920> it<00:02:25.190> just<00:02:25.220> does<00:02:25.730> even<00:02:26.270> out<00:02:26.420> the<00:02:26.600> final

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
think it just does even out the final

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.270 
think it just does even out the final
finish<00:02:27.680> so<00:02:28.489> you<00:02:28.550> might<00:02:29.330> sometimes<00:02:29.870> think<00:02:30.050> no

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
finish so you might sometimes think no

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.300 
finish so you might sometimes think no
fingerprints<00:02:31.280> and<00:02:32.170> but<00:02:33.170> if<00:02:33.620> you<00:02:33.739> don't<00:02:33.980> then

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
fingerprints and but if you don't then

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.640 
fingerprints and but if you don't then
that's<00:02:35.239> fine<00:02:35.360> just<00:02:35.810> make<00:02:35.930> sure<00:02:36.290> that<00:02:36.319> you

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
that's fine just make sure that you

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.509 
that's fine just make sure that you
smooth<00:02:37.640> right<00:02:37.910> down<00:02:38.320> just<00:02:39.320> and<00:02:39.680> just<00:02:39.830> with<00:02:40.400> it

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
smooth right down just and just with it

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:42.580 
smooth right down just and just with it
with<00:02:41.030> clean<00:02:41.269> fingers<00:02:41.720> at<00:02:41.840> the<00:02:41.959> end<00:02:42.110> it's<00:02:42.410> that

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
with clean fingers at the end it's that

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.640 
with clean fingers at the end it's that
you<00:02:42.739> can<00:02:42.920> do<00:02:43.489> it<00:02:43.550> all<00:02:43.670> the<00:02:43.760> same<00:02:43.910> way<00:02:44.440> i'm<00:02:45.440> going

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
you can do it all the same way i'm going

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.020 
you can do it all the same way i'm going
to<00:02:45.769> apply<00:02:45.920> a<00:02:46.430> little<00:02:47.000> bit<00:02:47.180> of<00:02:48.580> concealer<00:02:49.580> i<00:02:49.970> do

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
to apply a little bit of concealer i do

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.970 
to apply a little bit of concealer i do
that<00:02:50.269> you<00:02:50.540> do<00:02:50.660> that<00:02:50.690> after<00:02:51.230> you<00:02:51.560> put<00:02:51.769> your<00:02:51.860> base

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
that you do that after you put your base

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.759 
that you do that after you put your base
on<00:02:52.280> because<00:02:52.970> that<00:02:53.000> just<00:02:53.360> makes<00:02:53.750> it<00:02:53.930> stay

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
on because that just makes it stay

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:56.229 
on because that just makes it stay
longer<00:02:55.040> because<00:02:55.430> you<00:02:55.550> but<00:02:55.670> you<00:02:55.730> come<00:02:55.880> c<00:02:56.060> long

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
longer because you but you come c long

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:57.790 
longer because you but you come c long
first<00:02:56.510> then<00:02:56.750> you're<00:02:56.870> basing<00:02:57.350> your<00:02:57.380> sort<00:02:57.709> of

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
first then you're basing your sort of

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.630 
first then you're basing your sort of
wiping<00:02:58.100> it<00:02:58.250> off<00:02:58.310> again<00:02:58.670> so<00:02:59.560> concealer<00:03:00.640> for

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
under eyes just a peachy color works

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:09.640 
under eyes just a peachy color works

blake lively picture that we were

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.210 
blake lively picture that we were
looking<00:03:11.150> at<00:03:11.239> and<00:03:11.680> she's<00:03:12.680> very<00:03:12.769> much

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
looking at and she's very much

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.310 
looking at and she's very much
highlighted<00:03:13.910> eyes<00:03:14.150> right<00:03:14.959> in<00:03:15.079> the<00:03:15.170> corner

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
highlighted eyes right in the corner

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.170

apart you can even do that with your
foundation<00:03:20.480> or<00:03:20.600> concealer<00:03:20.630> and<00:03:21.049> just<00:03:21.200> put<00:03:21.320> a

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
foundation or concealer and just put a

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.220 
foundation or concealer and just put a
tiny<00:03:21.650> bit<00:03:21.950> just<00:03:22.400> in<00:03:22.579> the<00:03:22.730> corners<00:03:23.180> to<00:03:23.930> start

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
tiny bit just in the corners to start

brightening up the whole eye area it

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.110 
brightening up the whole eye area it
just<00:03:27.019> reflects<00:03:27.380> a<00:03:27.500> bit<00:03:27.620> of<00:03:27.709> light<00:03:27.920> back<00:03:28.220> which

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
just reflects a bit of light back which

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
is the optical illusion and now i need

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:34.210 
is the optical illusion and now i need
to<00:03:31.670> build<00:03:31.910> up<00:03:32.120> some<00:03:32.560> contours<00:03:33.560> and<00:03:33.739> some<00:03:34.100> of

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
to build up some contours and some of

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.370 
to build up some contours and some of
the<00:03:34.310> golden<00:03:34.670> glow<00:03:34.940> they've<00:03:35.150> got<00:03:35.329> going<00:03:35.510> on<00:03:35.750> it

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
the golden glow they've got going on it

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.880 
the golden glow they've got going on it
was<00:03:36.590> the<00:03:36.769> best<00:03:36.890> work<00:03:37.190> and<00:03:37.640> good<00:03:38.359> match<00:03:39.170> missing

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
was the best work and good match missing

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.060 
was the best work and good match missing
time<00:03:40.450> it's<00:03:41.450> so<00:03:41.600> difficult<00:03:41.810> isn't<00:03:42.200> it<00:03:42.380> it's<00:03:42.980> a

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.070 
time it's so difficult isn't it it's a

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:44.860 
time it's so difficult isn't it it's a
lot<00:03:43.190> of<00:03:43.250> all<00:03:43.400> time<00:03:43.609> to<00:03:43.790> do<00:03:43.940> that<00:03:44.120> the<00:03:44.630> best

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
lot of all time to do that the best

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.710 
lot of all time to do that the best
thing<00:03:45.079> to<00:03:45.109> do<00:03:45.320> is<00:03:45.590> really<00:03:45.950> just<00:03:46.430> try<00:03:46.760> try<00:03:47.480> some

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
thing to do is really just try try some

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.610 
thing to do is really just try try some
on<00:03:47.840> your<00:03:47.989> face<00:03:48.200> it<00:03:48.500> can<00:03:48.739> from<00:03:50.170> foreign<00:03:51.170> texture

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
on your face it can from foreign texture

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.979 
on your face it can from foreign texture
just<00:03:52.220> for<00:03:52.370> a<00:03:52.430> little<00:03:52.459> bit<00:03:52.700> here<00:03:53.000> but<00:03:53.299> this<00:03:53.810> is

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
just for a little bit here but this is

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:56.050 
just for a little bit here but this is
this<00:03:54.170> colorway<00:03:54.739> once<00:03:55.160> you<00:03:55.609> don't<00:03:55.790> want<00:03:55.940> any

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
this colorway once you don't want any

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.569 
this colorway once you don't want any
discrepancies<00:03:56.900> really<00:03:57.260> and<00:03:58.190> if<00:03:58.310> it<00:03:58.400> looks

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:58.579 
discrepancies really and if it looks

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:01.920 
discrepancies really and if it looks
like<00:03:58.940> it's<00:03:59.420> natural<00:04:00.019> there<00:04:00.260> it<00:04:00.769> should<00:04:01.040> work

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
like it's natural there it should work

can feel exactly where that contour

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:48.350 
can feel exactly where that contour
should<00:05:45.100> sit<00:05:45.600> just<00:05:46.600> underneath<00:05:46.990> there<00:05:47.410> and

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 
should sit just underneath there and

should sit just underneath there and
blend<00:05:49.360> that<00:05:49.480> up<00:05:49.540> into<00:05:49.960> the<00:05:50.080> other<00:05:50.200> color<00:05:51.160> that
