00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:07.200
 nice cc i am peter welcome define 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.519
 invests a lot in playing 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.170
 crucible finds me in situations where 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.300
 I don't feel totally supported by the 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.040
 my team moment when despite me 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.900
 have it in the player team 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.880
 my classmates notice at a high level 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.640
 strategies that are not effective or at worst 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.930
 of non-existent cases I not only notice 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.820
 often that about half of the players 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.109
 often goes in installments or negative 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.880
 and then I thought to make a 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.769
 video giving advice on how maybe 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.570
 able to improve in crucible species in 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.920
 perfect hand timing control 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.390
 to the other seen the approach of the 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.910
 osiride tests on which I will surely do 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.040
 a video we start by commenting on this 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.770
 match precisely on lands of rust 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.530
 on earth in control I will let go 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.149
 the gameplay and I will comment on every nation but 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.370
 above all the reasoning that we have 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.079
 at the base but almost forgot one thing 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.210
 very important before leaving 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.070
 the mini map south east nor is it known perhaps 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.110
 plus a radar and constantly shows e 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.550
 also approximately the direction e 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.230
 the proximity of the enemy 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.239
 learn to interpret it correctly a 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.469
 check it frequently especially if 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.480
 you have no enemies yet 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.769
 proximity but above all to use one 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.420
 instrument of deception to induce 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.310
 the opponent make mistakes e 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.720
 then drag it into your traps 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.600
 give a couple of examples in a while 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.460
 about the first piece of advice I want 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.470
 give you regards the control mode e 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.950
 aim the intermediate goal at the beginning 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.470
 game 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.790
 in this case on rust cloths b la 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.990
 most of your team like 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.880
 usually focuses on the goal 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.820
 easier to get the nearest one 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.409
 but you make that extra effort 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.759
 to give maybe that initial advantage 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.009
 your team to have two 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.670
 goals controlled in this case I have 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.409
 had luck and my companions 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.549
 they assisted in the enterprise but how 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.350
 see in this beginning instead of 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.659
 match on dusk a 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.399
 I'll have the same luck I'm alone I'm 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.110
 in numerical parity and there is also to say 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.030
 that they did not lay well in the cards but without 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.780
 support just ca n't get it 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.220
 the target 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.630
 back to the previous internal match 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.740
 del udc we see what happens in 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.000
 this clip 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.619
 first I'm commuting 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.360
 between bec to defend the two objectives 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.369
 of my team when I realize 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.960
 that there is under attack and that is also 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.610
 lowering the flag very quickly 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.360
 most likely it is three o 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.729
 four enemies 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.439
 then what is right I remain in 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.819
 defensive I let them be a 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.310
 commit it wrong to come towards it 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.520
 me I have the goldengas out one out 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.200
 two of them have been reckless 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.880
 not me and now I can be a 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.710
 go offensive having the numbers 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.540
 of my part and also to conquer 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.370
 a flag that surely if you were 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.710
 I had recklessly done the first one 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.240
 move I wouldn't even have seen that 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.880
 this move led to a lockdown 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.230
 three conquered goals this is alone 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.330
 one of many examples of how an action 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.770
 reasoned more cautious and shrewd 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.450
 bring benefits to your style of 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.220
 game and also to your team 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.720
 let's go back a second and see 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.500
 It happens after I was still 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.850
 precisely b 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.340
 I realize that my whole team and or 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.110
 his or and consequently suffered the next 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.910
 dot has opponents and a lot 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.470
 in fact there is probably the mini map 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.460
 or the radar if we so wish to call it 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.140
 ends gives reason 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.700
 also everything was also coming 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.410
 heavy ammunition and certainly not wanted 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.150
 leave this opportunity to 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.060
 take back my two goals of 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.620
 consequently the impact on time is this 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.030
 another example instead showing how 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.400
 the awareness of what surrounds us 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.350
 or even try to predict the location 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.510
 enemy based on the position of 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.460
 your allies can help both yours 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.050
 team again that is your style 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:13.790
 of game definitely improving it in 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.900
 positive here we were able indeed to 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.270
 defend chic with this action 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:20.000
 preventive but also the first example 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.410
 the goldengas shows how if I 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.300
 opponents have precisely the objective 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.860
 they just took b sure you are 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.570
 arrive towards c then then 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.160
 definitely be you preparing the 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.510
 trap is being defensive 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.400
 here we are heading towards the end 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.570
 fortunately I can play a whole game 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.950
 good series of killings with mine 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.810
 heavy machine gun against the 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.700
 prediction and I'll be honest we'll go to 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.720
 win something like 100 points then 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.250
 really a trifle 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.600
 and if I did n't feel supported 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.280
 from my team if I had not seen 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.780
 smart choices that you are 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.580
 perfectly integrated with my style of 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.920
 game we would not have won and this is it 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.750
 sure enough the interesting fact though 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.850
 as you will see from the end statistics 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.890
 match and four members of mine 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.959
 team are in installments or negative 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:58.580
 this means it clearly shows us how 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:59.360
 even if you are not more accurate the 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.740
 deadly 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.570
 you can still do a good game 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.830
 of control if in any case it was net vision 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:05.120
 your choices 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.800
 We now pass a game in the breach 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.390
 we see twilight as mine 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.860
 team only goal foods is 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.630
 definitely the intermediate goal from 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.790
 aim but there are still many enemies 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.650
 as you can see they are interposed 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.419
 between me and the goal therefore decided to 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.380
 remain defensive for a moment to clean 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:22.910
 the cleanable and then I went harmlessly 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.320
 now the map shows an enemy who in 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.180
 previously did not appear therefore I must 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.370
 improvise but now definitely the 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.630
 free road to b this instead a 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.310
 defense council or even i 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.990
 attempts to achieve a goal 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.280
 when you feel like doing one 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.690
 of stations most likely 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.979
 an avalanche of enemies will arrive a 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.510
 try to stop me 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:39.890
 my advice is don't hold back 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.570
 inside the lens a 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:44.240
 do prey for your opponents but 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:46.580
 move you are dynamic and do not do 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.080
 let's wait as you see at the end 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.490
 I died the same but I certainly have 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.320
 sold dear the skin I brought home 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.030
 three killings would have been much better 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.620
 if my team had helped me but 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:57.560
 most likely they were concentrated 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.539
 too much about it according to me strategy 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:02.030
 erroneously here I realize that there is one 

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:03.680
 of my companions suffered to try alone 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.090
 to resume the goal and this is 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.470
 what I wanted to do happens if before 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.330
 that anyway someone arrived in mine 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.750
 help and give me a hand to conquer 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:09.950
 b 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.270
 most likely if he had had a 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:11.780
 mate from my city for i made in 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.550
 priority 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.470
 here I go straight to give one 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.160
 hand and fortunately there is only one enemy 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:18.560
 to kill 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.450
 there is our fair I can start over 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.010
 from now on to do just like in 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:23.150
 previously the commuter between bec a 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.310
 defend both objectives a little 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.090
 maintaining superiority and advantage 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:27.800
 for my team 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.720
 the increase is to be done a little more than 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.700
 struggling to fill the role of that 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.289
 that beats all goals but 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.370
 please note in this situation if not 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:36.289
 I'm the one who does it 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:37.460
 all five of my companions are suu 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:39.410
 kyi to defend easier goal 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.400
 while it is quietly left to itself 

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:41.630
 same 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.370
 now the same will occur 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:45.320
 first situation where I am 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:47.450
 center or you have to take b they will arrive a 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.340
 pair of red up enemies has luck either 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:51.500
 let's say true because mined the fact is 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:53.510
 however I do not stand still to do the 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.130
 prey for my opponents now 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:56.810
 skipper or until the end of the game and you will see 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:58.880
 of how we won by 5000 points 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:59.840
 surely you will come to say well better 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.820
 before 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.280
 not at all I enjoyed a lot of 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.970
 more in the previous game 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.289
 essentially because I'm not 

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.970
 found doing dirty work on the 

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:09.770
 yours I see even now in the 

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:11.120
 statistics at the end of the game which are two
