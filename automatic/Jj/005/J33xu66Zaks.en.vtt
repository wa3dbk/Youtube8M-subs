00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
tablet here in Beijing China and so as

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.830 
tablet here in Beijing China and so as
you<00:00:10.320> can<00:00:10.410> see<00:00:10.620> on<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.820> front<00:00:12.179> it<00:00:12.360> looks<00:00:12.389> very

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
you can see on the front it looks very

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.180 
you can see on the front it looks very
much<00:00:13.410> like<00:00:13.440> any<00:00:13.860> ordinary<00:00:14.130> honeycomb<00:00:14.820> tablet

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:16.190 
much like any ordinary honeycomb tablet

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.960 
much like any ordinary honeycomb tablet
so<00:00:17.190> far<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.910> response<00:00:18.480> is<00:00:18.960> pretty<00:00:19.770> smooth<00:00:20.039> but

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
so far the response is pretty smooth but

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.359 
so far the response is pretty smooth but
then<00:00:21.330> again<00:00:21.420> it<00:00:21.689> is<00:00:21.840> kind<00:00:22.680> of<00:00:22.740> a<00:00:22.800> fresh<00:00:23.039> build

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
then again it is kind of a fresh build

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.540 
then again it is kind of a fresh build
so<00:00:24.109> let's<00:00:25.109> not<00:00:25.289> judge<00:00:25.560> it<00:00:25.590> too<00:00:25.859> much<00:00:26.039> right<00:00:26.400> now

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
so let's not judge it too much right now

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.849 
so let's not judge it too much right now
but<00:00:27.330> let's<00:00:27.900> give<00:00:28.109> you<00:00:28.289> guys<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.500> quick

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
but let's give you guys a quick

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.070 
but let's give you guys a quick
walkthrough<00:00:29.130> first<00:00:29.640> so<00:00:29.939> at<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.510> top<00:00:30.720> we<00:00:30.929> have

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
walkthrough first so at the top we have

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.190 
walkthrough first so at the top we have
a<00:00:31.109> 2<00:00:31.470> megapixel<00:00:31.619> front<00:00:32.309> facing<00:00:32.369> camera<00:00:33.000> and

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.200 
a 2 megapixel front facing camera and

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.510 
a 2 megapixel front facing camera and
that's<00:00:34.200> pretty<00:00:34.530> much<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.770> only<00:00:34.920> feature<00:00:35.219> here

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
that's pretty much the only feature here

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:42.470 
that's pretty much the only feature here
on<00:00:35.670> this<00:00:36.480> side<00:00:36.780> we<00:00:37.469> have<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:38.600> micro<00:00:39.980> micro<00:00:41.480> USB

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
on this side we have a micro micro USB

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.729 
on this side we have a micro micro USB
port<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:43.110> if<00:00:43.530> you<00:00:43.710> lift<00:00:44.460> this<00:00:44.670> flap<00:00:45.180> open<00:00:45.780> you

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
port and if you lift this flap open you

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.830 
port and if you lift this flap open you
can<00:00:46.890> actually<00:00:47.010> put<00:00:47.370> in<00:00:47.539> see<00:00:48.539> if<00:00:48.600> we<00:00:48.690> can<00:00:48.780> get

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
can actually put in see if we can get

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.740 
can actually put in see if we can get
some<00:00:48.899> better<00:00:49.140> lighting<00:00:49.410> in<00:00:49.850> so<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:51.629> can

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
some better lighting in so you can

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.400 
some better lighting in so you can
actually<00:00:51.870> see<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.860> slot<00:00:53.640> for<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:54.410> standard

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
actually see a slot for the standard

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.060 
actually see a slot for the standard
sized<00:00:55.910> sdhc<00:00:56.910> card<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.480> here<00:00:58.410> this<00:00:58.829> is

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
sized sdhc card and here this is

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.760

reserved for a for the sim card and
right<00:01:02.430> now<00:01:02.609> there<00:01:02.850> aren't<00:01:03.000> any<00:01:03.210> plans<00:01:03.449> to

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
right now there aren't any plans to

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.280 
right now there aren't any plans to
launch<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:04.140> 3g<00:01:04.890> version<00:01:05.100> in<00:01:05.400> china<00:01:05.670> but<00:01:06.330> we<00:01:07.140> may

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
launch a 3g version in china but we may

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.030 
launch a 3g version in china but we may
see<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.909> overseas<00:01:08.909> at<00:01:09.540> some<00:01:09.900> point<00:01:10.140> at<00:01:10.950> the

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
see that overseas at some point at the

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.330 
see that overseas at some point at the
bottom<00:01:11.369> we<00:01:11.580> have<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:12.439> pair<00:01:13.439> of<00:01:13.590> speakers<00:01:13.890> and

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
bottom we have the pair of speakers and

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.170 
bottom we have the pair of speakers and
a<00:01:14.670> 40<00:01:15.060> bin<00:01:15.240> 40-pin<00:01:15.990> dock<00:01:16.259> connector<00:01:16.740> on<00:01:17.700> this

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
a 40 bin 40-pin dock connector on this

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.450 
a 40 bin 40-pin dock connector on this
side<00:01:18.390> we<00:01:18.600> have<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.810> volume<00:01:19.259> rocker<00:01:19.590> in<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:19.979> 3.5

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
side we have a volume rocker in a 3.5

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.330 
side we have a volume rocker in a 3.5
mil<00:01:20.700> headphone<00:01:21.119> jack<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.920> that's<00:01:22.920> presumably

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
mil headphone jack and that's presumably

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.410 
mil headphone jack and that's presumably
the<00:01:23.820> mic<00:01:24.060> on<00:01:24.619> the<00:01:25.619> back<00:01:25.860> we<00:01:26.280> have<00:01:26.580> a<00:01:26.880> 5

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
the mic on the back we have a 5

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.789 
the mic on the back we have a 5
megapixel<00:01:27.630> camera<00:01:28.380> with<00:01:28.560> flash<00:01:29.780> so<00:01:30.780> down<00:01:31.590> here

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
megapixel camera with flash so down here

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.050 
megapixel camera with flash so down here
that's<00:01:32.280> probably<00:01:32.479> space<00:01:33.479> for<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.810> 3g<00:01:34.290> module

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
that's probably space for a 3g module

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.890 
that's probably space for a 3g module
it's<00:01:36.060> not<00:01:36.210> something<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.479> we<00:01:36.630> can<00:01:36.780> fiddle

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
it's not something that we can fiddle

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.530 
it's not something that we can fiddle
with<00:01:37.020> so<00:01:37.680> oh<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.400> you<00:01:38.880> can<00:01:38.970> see<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.299> lovely

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
brushed aluminium back here actually

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.080 
brushed aluminium back here actually
kind<00:01:42.780> of<00:01:42.810> feels<00:01:42.990> kind<00:01:43.200> of<00:01:43.259> nice<00:01:43.380> here<00:01:44.090> actually

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
speaking of feel it's also worth

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.210 
speaking of feel it's also worth
mentioning<00:01:47.939> that<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:49.110> top<00:01:49.590> side<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.939> top<00:01:51.149> of

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
mentioning that the top side the top of

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.100 
mentioning that the top side the top of
rim<00:01:53.220> is<00:01:53.520> actually<00:01:54.149> actually<00:01:54.630> has<00:01:54.750> a<00:01:54.780> nice

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110

rim is actually actually has a nice
rubbery<00:01:55.890> feel<00:01:55.920> so<00:01:56.570> gives<00:01:57.570> us<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:57.930> secure<00:01:58.549> grip

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
rubbery feel so gives us a secure grip

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.420 
rubbery feel so gives us a secure grip
and<00:02:00.049> we<00:02:01.049> almost<00:02:01.229> missed<00:02:01.530> one<00:02:01.860> feature<00:02:02.159> so

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
and we almost missed one feature so

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.090 
and we almost missed one feature so
that's<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.780> dell<00:02:03.780> divide<00:02:04.170> feature<00:02:04.799> so

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
that's the dell divide feature so

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.100 
that's the dell divide feature so
let's<00:02:06.700> just<00:02:06.939> get<00:02:07.030> out<00:02:07.210> here<00:02:07.360> so<00:02:07.540> this<00:02:07.720> is<00:02:07.930> the

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
let's just get out here so this is the

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.320 
let's just get out here so this is the
usual<00:02:08.380> home<00:02:08.709> screen<00:02:09.009> and<00:02:09.190> if<00:02:09.550> you<00:02:09.759> double<00:02:10.119> tap

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
usual home screen and if you double tap

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.620 
usual home screen and if you double tap
the<00:02:10.630> home<00:02:11.050> button<00:02:11.290> you<00:02:12.220> switch<00:02:12.490> to<00:02:12.700> this<00:02:12.850> what

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
the home button you switch to this what

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.770 
the home button you switch to this what
they<00:02:13.720> call<00:02:13.750> a<00:02:13.959> dell<00:02:14.530> divide<00:02:14.920> UI<00:02:15.489> and<00:02:16.000> it's

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
they call a dell divide UI and it's

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.930 
they call a dell divide UI and it's
basically<00:02:17.319> it's<00:02:17.530> as<00:02:17.800> you<00:02:17.980> can<00:02:18.100> see<00:02:18.220> it's<00:02:18.580> work

I<00:02:24.400> LA<00:02:24.580> so<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:27.220> way<00:02:27.340> you<00:02:27.400> can<00:02:27.550> say<00:02:27.760> it's<00:02:27.970> like

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
I LA so the way you can say it's like

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.650 
I LA so the way you can say it's like
the<00:02:28.500> alternative<00:02:29.500> version<00:02:29.830> of<00:02:30.450> desktop<00:02:31.450> and

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
the alternative version of desktop and

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.510 
the alternative version of desktop and
it's<00:02:31.810> actually<00:02:31.900> pretty<00:02:32.140> smooth<00:02:32.500> so<00:02:32.800> some

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
it's actually pretty smooth so some

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.180 
it's actually pretty smooth so some
people<00:02:33.760> may<00:02:33.940> find<00:02:34.180> out<00:02:34.390> useful<00:02:34.780> so<00:02:35.500> when<00:02:36.100> you

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
people may find out useful so when you

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.370 
people may find out useful so when you
jump<00:02:36.400> back<00:02:36.520> out<00:02:36.670> and<00:02:36.880> that's<00:02:37.090> what<00:02:37.450> you<00:02:37.959> get

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
jump back out and that's what you get

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.140 
jump back out and that's what you get
back<00:02:38.530> to<00:02:38.620> your<00:02:38.739> usual<00:02:38.970> entertaining<00:02:39.970> stuff

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
and so inside this tablet we have a 11

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.220 
and so inside this tablet we have a 11
gigabytes<00:02:45.010> worth<00:02:45.250> of<00:02:45.489> ram<00:02:45.760> and<00:02:46.030> 16<00:02:46.840> gigabytes

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
gigabytes worth of ram and 16 gigabytes

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.479 
gigabytes worth of ram and 16 gigabytes
of<00:02:47.410> storage<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:49.150> screen<00:02:49.569> is<00:02:49.600> 1280<00:02:50.319> x<00:02:50.560> 800<00:02:50.739> 10.1

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
of storage the screen is 1280 x 800 10.1

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.080 
of storage the screen is 1280 x 800 10.1
inches<00:02:51.880> of<00:02:52.180> course<00:02:52.450> and<00:02:52.750> it's<00:02:53.319> powered<00:02:53.980> by<00:02:54.090> an

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
inches of course and it's powered by an

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.690 
inches of course and it's powered by an
nvidia<00:02:55.660> tegra<00:02:55.930> two<00:02:56.200> t20<00:02:56.830> so<00:02:57.040> it's<00:02:57.430> running<00:02:57.640> out

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
nvidia tegra two t20 so it's running out

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.300 
nvidia tegra two t20 so it's running out
one<00:02:57.910> gigahertz<00:02:58.209> dual-core<00:02:58.989> of<00:02:59.410> course<00:02:59.680> so

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
one gigahertz dual-core of course so

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.390 
one gigahertz dual-core of course so
that's<00:03:00.700> pretty<00:03:01.180> much<00:03:01.420> it<00:03:01.480> oh<00:03:01.810> and<00:03:02.340> for<00:03:03.340> the

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
that's pretty much it oh and for the

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.350 
that's pretty much it oh and for the
sake<00:03:03.670> of<00:03:03.700> comparison<00:03:04.330> we<00:03:04.870> have<00:03:05.170> our<00:03:05.500> very<00:03:06.069> own

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
sake of comparison we have our very own

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.990 
sake of comparison we have our very own
samsung<00:03:07.360> galaxy<00:03:07.720> tab<00:03:07.930> 10.1<00:03:08.080> and<00:03:09.000> it's

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
samsung galaxy tab 10.1 and it's

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.370 
samsung galaxy tab 10.1 and it's
actually<00:03:10.120> gained<00:03:10.510> a<00:03:10.660> bit<00:03:11.110> more<00:03:11.290> attention

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
actually gained a bit more attention

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.080 
actually gained a bit more attention
than<00:03:11.739> we<00:03:12.100> would<00:03:12.400> have<00:03:12.430> liked<00:03:12.670> because<00:03:12.850> it's

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
than we would have liked because it's

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.880 
than we would have liked because it's
not<00:03:13.239> actually<00:03:13.570> house<00:03:13.720> in<00:03:13.900> china<00:03:14.140> yet<00:03:14.410> but<00:03:14.829> you

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
not actually house in china yet but you

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.789 
not actually house in china yet but you
can<00:03:14.980> see<00:03:15.310> obviously<00:03:16.150> the<00:03:16.390> dell<00:03:16.690> tablet<00:03:17.079> is<00:03:17.470> a

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
can see obviously the dell tablet is a

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:21.690 
can see obviously the dell tablet is a
bit<00:03:18.489> thicker<00:03:18.790> but<00:03:19.360> it<00:03:19.780> is<00:03:20.079> cheaper<00:03:20.530> and<00:03:20.700> they

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
bit thicker but it is cheaper and they

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.900 
bit thicker but it is cheaper and they
are<00:03:21.880> selling<00:03:22.410> the<00:03:23.410> street<00:03:23.709> tempo<00:03:24.160> for<00:03:24.430> just

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
are selling the street tempo for just

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.259 
are selling the street tempo for just
under<00:03:25.030> 3,000<00:03:25.840> RMB<00:03:26.560> so<00:03:27.130> that<00:03:27.430> is<00:03:27.670> definitely

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
under 3,000 RMB so that is definitely

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:31.080 
under 3,000 RMB so that is definitely
cheaper<00:03:28.480> than<00:03:28.840> the<00:03:29.049> ipad<00:03:29.440> and<00:03:29.739> possibly<00:03:30.280> the

cheaper than the ipad and possibly the

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.340 
cheaper than the ipad and possibly the
