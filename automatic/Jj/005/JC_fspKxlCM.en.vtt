if<00:03:05.130> that<00:03:05.400> cold<00:03:05.730> air<00:03:06.030> mass<00:03:06.270> gets<00:03:06.660> enough

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
if that cold air mass gets enough

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.470 
if that cold air mass gets enough
strength<00:03:07.290> then<00:03:08.040> we<00:03:08.250> develop<00:03:08.700> a<00:03:08.850> cold<00:03:09.150> front

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
strength then we develop a cold front

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.290 
strength then we develop a cold front
which<00:03:10.170> you<00:03:10.290> would<00:03:10.410> find<00:03:10.709> blue<00:03:11.430> triangles<00:03:12.180> at

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
which you would find blue triangles at

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.880 
which you would find blue triangles at
once

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
once

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.059 
once
on<00:03:13.100> a<00:03:13.160> weather<00:03:13.460> map<00:03:13.930> so<00:03:14.930> later<00:03:15.440> today<00:03:15.680> they're

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069 
on a weather map so later today they're

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:18.190 
on a weather map so later today they're
forecasting<00:03:16.490> thunderstorms<00:03:16.970> for<00:03:17.780> the<00:03:17.840> area

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
forecasting thunderstorms for the area

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.860 
forecasting thunderstorms for the area
if<00:03:18.440> that<00:03:19.069> happens<00:03:19.550> most<00:03:19.790> likely<00:03:20.209> it<00:03:20.300> is<00:03:20.390> a<00:03:20.510> cold

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
if that happens most likely it is a cold

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.140 
if that happens most likely it is a cold
front<00:03:20.990> coming<00:03:21.530> through<00:03:22.010> it's<00:03:22.700> going<00:03:22.880> to<00:03:22.940> bring

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
front coming through it's going to bring

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.990 
front coming through it's going to bring
in<00:03:23.300> strong<00:03:23.660> storms<00:03:24.410> now<00:03:25.160> if<00:03:25.250> that<00:03:25.459> air<00:03:25.760> mass

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
in strong storms now if that air mass

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.480 
in strong storms now if that air mass
the<00:03:26.300> warmer<00:03:26.630> air<00:03:26.780> mass<00:03:27.050> decides<00:03:27.560> to<00:03:27.920> move<00:03:28.100> and

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:28.490 
the warmer air mass decides to move and

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.840 
the warmer air mass decides to move and
we<00:03:28.880> develop<00:03:29.300> a<00:03:29.480> warm<00:03:29.810> front<00:03:30.170> and<00:03:30.590> that<00:03:31.459> is<00:03:31.640> red

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
we develop a warm front and that is red

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.720 
we develop a warm front and that is red
semi<00:03:32.270> circles<00:03:32.690> on<00:03:32.840> one<00:03:33.050> side<00:03:33.290> if<00:03:34.100> a<00:03:34.220> warm<00:03:34.490> front

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
semi circles on one side if a warm front

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.510 
semi circles on one side if a warm front
occurs<00:03:35.120> the<00:03:35.630> warmer<00:03:36.110> air<00:03:36.140> mass<00:03:36.560> takes<00:03:37.070> over<00:03:37.400> an

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:37.520 
occurs the warmer air mass takes over an

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.620 
occurs the warmer air mass takes over an
area<00:03:37.730> that<00:03:37.910> was<00:03:38.030> once<00:03:38.180> cooler

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
area that was once cooler

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.420 
area that was once cooler
and<00:03:39.780> on<00:03:40.230> a<00:03:40.260> weather<00:03:40.500> map<00:03:40.740> you<00:03:40.890> see<00:03:41.070> the<00:03:41.220> red

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
and on a weather map you see the red

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.850 
and on a weather map you see the red
semi<00:03:42.030> circles<00:03:42.510> so<00:03:42.960> later<00:03:43.170> today<00:03:43.410> we<00:03:43.710> will

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
semi circles so later today we will

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.560

that we need to talk about is the
occluded<00:04:01.900> front<00:04:02.230> we've<00:04:02.739> discussed<00:04:03.190> the

stationary front which is the weather
we're

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
we're

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.090 
we're
it<00:04:07.060> talks<00:04:07.300> about<00:04:07.390> the<00:04:07.540> cold<00:04:07.870> front<00:04:08.140> and<00:04:08.770> also

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
it talks about the cold front and also

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:10.010 
it talks about the cold front and also
the<00:04:09.220> warm

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.020 
the warm

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.230 
the warm
but<00:04:10.470> every<00:04:10.710> once<00:04:10.890> in<00:04:11.100> a<00:04:11.160> while<00:04:11.370> that<00:04:11.730> cold

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:12.240 
but every once in a while that cold

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.660 
but every once in a while that cold
front<00:04:12.360> oh

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
front oh

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.180

when<00:04:15.180> that<00:04:15.300> happens<00:04:15.870> they<00:04:16.440> create<00:04:16.859> an

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
when that happens they create an

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.620 
when that happens they create an

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
occluded front an occluded front we use

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.500 
occluded front an occluded front we use
semi<00:04:21.630> circles

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:29.250 

on<00:04:24.720> the<00:04:24.930> same<00:04:25.200> side<00:04:25.670> my<00:04:26.670> assistant<00:04:27.450> here

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
on the same side my assistant here

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.740 
on the same side my assistant here
will<00:04:29.740> show<00:04:29.980> that<00:04:30.370> the<00:04:30.700> low<00:04:30.910> pressure<00:04:31.210> which<00:04:31.600> we

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
will show that the low pressure which we

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.410 
will show that the low pressure which we
talked<00:04:31.990> about<00:04:32.140> last<00:04:32.290> week<00:04:32.860> a<00:04:33.100> cyclone<00:04:33.730> the

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:34.420 
talked about last week a cyclone the

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:39.890 
talked about last week a cyclone the

basically the cold air on either side

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:48.159 
basically the cold air on either side
sandwiches<00:04:43.300> the<00:04:43.570> warm<00:04:43.870> air<00:04:44.350> and<00:04:44.920> creates<00:04:45.370> this

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
different fronts we talked about are

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.780 
different fronts we talked about are
also<00:05:20.580> on<00:05:21.030> here<00:05:21.360> we<00:05:22.050> have<00:05:22.320> our<00:05:22.430> little<00:05:23.430> bit<00:05:23.640> of<00:05:23.730> a

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:23.790 
also on here we have our little bit of a

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:26.750 
also on here we have our little bit of a
warm<00:05:24.060> front<00:05:24.390> and<00:05:24.750> then<00:05:25.170> a<00:05:25.290> long<00:05:25.590> draping<00:05:26.310> cold

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
warm front and then a long draping cold

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.450 
warm front and then a long draping cold
front<00:05:27.090> I<00:05:27.270> get<00:05:27.480> across<00:05:28.470> most<00:05:28.800> of<00:05:28.950> the<00:05:29.010> United

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
front I get across most of the United

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.510 
front I get across most of the United
States<00:05:29.630> up<00:05:30.630> here<00:05:31.050> off<00:05:31.350> the<00:05:31.380> east<00:05:31.950> coast<00:05:32.100> we

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
States up here off the east coast we

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.970 
States up here off the east coast we
have<00:05:32.730> a<00:05:32.760> bit<00:05:33.060> of<00:05:33.090> a<00:05:33.300> stationary<00:05:33.870> front<00:05:33.930> and<00:05:34.500> the

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:34.980 
have a bit of a stationary front and the

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.310 
have a bit of a stationary front and the
stationary<00:05:35.520> front<00:05:35.850> also<00:05:36.060> goes<00:05:36.420> into<00:05:36.450> the

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:37.320 
stationary front also goes into the

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.980 
stationary front also goes into the
western<00:05:37.680> portion<00:05:37.920> of<00:05:38.220> the<00:05:38.340> u.s.<00:05:38.610> at<00:05:39.480> the<00:05:39.630> very

into an area that was once warmer you

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.680 
into an area that was once warmer you

air mass moving into an area that's
cooler<00:06:02.940> it<00:06:03.630> becomes<00:06:04.050> a<00:06:04.290> warm<00:06:04.710> front<00:06:04.980> and<00:06:05.510> again

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:06.510 
cooler it becomes a warm front and again

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:09.020 
cooler it becomes a warm front and again
a<00:06:06.540> stationary<00:06:07.320> front<00:06:07.710> is<00:06:07.920> a<00:06:08.220> front<00:06:08.430> that<00:06:08.820> does

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.030 
a stationary front is a front that does

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:11.630 
a stationary front is a front that does
not<00:06:09.210> move<00:06:09.510> so<00:06:10.380> earlier<00:06:10.800> today<00:06:11.010> this

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:11.640 
not move so earlier today this

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.580 
not move so earlier today this
stationary<00:06:12.270> front<00:06:12.630> was<00:06:12.870> over<00:06:13.200> New<00:06:13.380> York<00:06:13.470> City

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:13.590 
stationary front was over New York City

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:16.580 
stationary front was over New York City
but<00:06:14.490> now<00:06:14.700> it<00:06:14.940> has<00:06:14.970> become<00:06:15.150> a<00:06:15.360> warm<00:06:15.720> front<00:06:16.050> and

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:16.590 
but now it has become a warm front and

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:19.460 
but now it has become a warm front and
we<00:06:16.830> are<00:06:16.950> in<00:06:17.070> the<00:06:17.220> warmer<00:06:17.670> air<00:06:18.110> tomorrow<00:06:19.110> the

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:19.470 
we are in the warmer air tomorrow the

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:21.590 
we are in the warmer air tomorrow the
weather<00:06:19.620> will<00:06:20.010> be<00:06:20.040> cooler<00:06:20.550> because<00:06:21.000> this<00:06:21.360> cold

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:21.600 
weather will be cooler because this cold

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.290 
weather will be cooler because this cold
front<00:06:21.960> will<00:06:22.260> come<00:06:22.470> through<00:06:22.700> the<00:06:23.700> rest<00:06:23.940> of<00:06:24.180> the
