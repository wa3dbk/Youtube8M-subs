i<00:03:24.030> am<00:03:25.030> i<00:03:25.360> estimate<00:03:26.290> that<00:03:26.350> we<00:03:26.620> got<00:03:26.800> another<00:03:27.070> like

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
i am i estimate that we got another like

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.300 
i am i estimate that we got another like
two<00:03:27.730> three<00:03:27.760> weeks<00:03:28.030> of<00:03:28.600> of<00:03:29.020> them<00:03:29.620> going<00:03:29.830> up<00:03:30.100> I

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
two three weeks of of them going up I

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.670 
two three weeks of of them going up I
don't<00:03:30.610> know<00:03:30.760> how<00:03:30.970> far<00:03:31.510> they<00:03:31.690> will<00:03:31.900> like<00:03:32.440> I

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
don't know how far they will like I

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.350 
don't know how far they will like I
think<00:03:33.370> possibly<00:03:33.970> Furies<00:03:34.570> might<00:03:34.930> reach<00:03:36.360> just

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
think possibly Furies might reach just

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.820 
think possibly Furies might reach just
3.6<00:03:38.230> 3.7<00:03:39.190> being<00:03:39.460> very<00:03:40.270> norm<00:03:40.780> to<00:03:41.200> buy<00:03:41.410> the<00:03:41.470> mat

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830

merging<00:04:53.620> strategy<00:04:54.520> that<00:04:54.790> I<00:04:54.820> use<00:04:55.210> is<00:04:55.480> just

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
merging strategy that I use is just

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.990 
merging strategy that I use is just
buying<00:04:56.320> and<00:04:56.710> selling<00:04:56.740> Furies<00:04:57.550> and<00:04:57.580> really

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
buying and selling Furies and really

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.909 
buying and selling Furies and really
this<00:04:58.180> works<00:04:58.450> for<00:04:58.630> anything<00:04:58.930> if<00:04:59.230> you<00:04:59.380> go<00:04:59.560> at<00:04:59.740> up
