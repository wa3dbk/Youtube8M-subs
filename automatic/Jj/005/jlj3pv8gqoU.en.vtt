 know the time where the Saudis headed 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.889
 intervention against the Shiite rebels and 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.079
 Western media pay special attention 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:19.519
 military support which Iran allegedly 

00:00:18.079 --> 00:00:22.519
 renders Yemeni armed

 Islamic extremism and the influence of Iran in 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:30.109
 Iran gives the Hussites the opportunity 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.059
 to carry out its activities coalition

 medical humanitarian aid for the first time 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.580
 since the start of the operation which is already 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.920
 a week is held by a coalition led by 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.720
 saudi arabia tehran criticized 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.000
 coalition actions calling them an act 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.800
 foreign aggression and riad turn 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.750
 claims that the Yemeni rebels 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.060
 directly receive support from Iran 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.460
 let's understand this competition

 saudi arabia sunni monarchy 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.510
 she realizes that the region is increasing 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.640
 Shiite influence primarily from 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.829
 Iran's garden oil industry 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.460
 may face plummeting prices 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:06.789
 for oil 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.049
 if sanctions against Iran are lifted 

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:10.819
 er-riad also warned the expansion 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:12.439

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:15.170
 Tehran will allow to continue to enrich

 Jones believes that the Saudis were wrong with 

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:26.899
 target selection Yemen consists of

 northern precisely and southern Yemeni

 society is not monolithic Hussites 

00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:34.569
 represent Shiite Islam 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:37.310
 however, it differs from Iranian Shiism 

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:39.560
 I think the degree of support of Hussites 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.899
 side of tehran is greatly exaggerated 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.789
 as well as the judgment that the Hussites 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:44.439
 is for Iranians great 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:47.090
 importance

 US enemies in the region are considered 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.139
 is both al-qaida and islamic 

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:53.959
 state which washington 

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:55.579
 opposed but I don't see the Saudis 

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:58.219
 these groups were bombed 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:02:00.249
 Saudis bombs Hussites who fight 

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:05.619
 with al-Qaeda and the Islamic State 

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:05.619
 isn't it logical and buildings to the shuttlecock a chance
