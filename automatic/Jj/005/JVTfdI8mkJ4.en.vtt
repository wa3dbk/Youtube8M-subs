00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
see the fat side of this Dean's has the

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.120 
see the fat side of this Dean's has the
positive<00:01:24.810> wire<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.530> skinny<00:01:25.860> side

positive wire to it and the skinny side
has<00:01:26.369> a<00:01:26.400> negative<00:01:26.700> so<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.509> would<00:01:27.750> think<00:01:27.960> was

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
has a negative so you would think was

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.539 
has a negative so you would think was
you<00:01:28.500> would<00:01:28.619> think<00:01:28.740> as<00:01:28.890> well<00:01:29.040> so<00:01:29.280> I'm<00:01:29.340> at<00:01:29.460> the

you guys understand what I'm saying out
so<00:01:49.770> even<00:01:50.100> though<00:01:50.159> this<00:01:50.340> wire<00:01:50.549> is<00:01:50.790> red<00:01:51.030> it

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
so even though this wire is red it

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.789 
so even though this wire is red it
actually<00:01:51.630> should<00:01:51.750> go<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.170> negative<00:01:52.380> and

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
actually should go to the negative and

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.940 
actually should go to the negative and
the<00:01:53.369> black<00:01:53.729> should<00:01:54.090> go<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.299> a<00:01:54.479> positive<00:01:55.020> DJ<00:01:55.920> I

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
the black should go to a positive DJ I

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.440 
the black should go to a positive DJ I
found<00:01:56.310> that<00:01:56.490> out<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:56.850> that's<00:01:57.000> why<00:01:57.270> they

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
found that out and that's why they

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.170 
found that out and that's why they
reversed<00:01:58.079> it<00:01:58.350> so<00:01:58.890> when<00:01:59.130> you<00:01:59.250> plug<00:01:59.520> this<00:01:59.759> into<00:02:00.030> a

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
reversed it so when you plug this into a

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.050 
reversed it so when you plug this into a
battery<00:02:00.689> that's<00:02:00.960> wired<00:02:01.350> correctly<00:02:01.710> as<00:02:02.310> this

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
battery that's wired correctly as this

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.530 
battery that's wired correctly as this
one<00:02:03.240> is<00:02:03.360> right<00:02:03.570> here<00:02:03.840> we're<00:02:04.829> gonna<00:02:04.890> plug<00:02:05.219> it<00:02:05.399> in

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
one is right here we're gonna plug it in

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.960 
one is right here we're gonna plug it in
now<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:06.600> noticed<00:02:07.170> here<00:02:07.530> black<00:02:08.250> is<00:02:08.550> going<00:02:08.879> to

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
now you noticed here black is going to

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.479 
now you noticed here black is going to
red<00:02:09.319> black<00:02:10.319> is<00:02:10.560> going<00:02:10.800> to<00:02:10.860> rich<00:02:10.979> so<00:02:11.220> you<00:02:11.250> would

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
red black is going to rich so you would

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.400 
red black is going to rich so you would
think<00:02:11.520> that<00:02:11.879> that's<00:02:12.180> incorrect

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
think that that's incorrect

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.840 
think that that's incorrect
actually<00:02:13.830> correct<00:02:14.160> now<00:02:14.490> I'm<00:02:14.640> going<00:02:14.790> to

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
actually correct now I'm going to

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:21.260 
actually correct now I'm going to
actually<00:02:15.030> plug<00:02:15.510> this<00:02:15.900> into<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.980> unit<00:02:20.120> you<00:02:21.120> can

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
actually plug this into the unit you can

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.520 
actually plug this into the unit you can
actually<00:02:21.570> see<00:02:21.690> the<00:02:21.810> fan<00:02:22.020> start<00:02:22.320> and<00:02:22.410> it's

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
actually see the fan start and it's

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:23.060 
actually see the fan start and it's
actually<00:02:22.800> lit

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
actually lit

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.220 
actually lit
that's<00:02:23.520> another<00:02:23.850> proof<00:02:24.120> to<00:02:24.300> show<00:02:24.480> you<00:02:24.540> that

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
that's another proof to show you that

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.680 
that's another proof to show you that
the<00:02:25.530> molding<00:02:26.100> on<00:02:26.580> this<00:02:26.910> was<00:02:27.120> actually<00:02:27.330> made

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
the molding on this was actually made

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.440 
the molding on this was actually made
wrong<00:02:27.990> at<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.230> factory<00:02:28.650> don't<00:02:29.370> cut<00:02:29.670> it<00:02:29.820> don't

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
wrong at the factory don't cut it don't

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.720 
wrong at the factory don't cut it don't
change<00:02:30.570> it<00:02:31.050> don't<00:02:31.230> reverse<00:02:31.740> the<00:02:32.280> red<00:02:32.460> as<00:02:32.610> you

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
change it don't reverse the red as you

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.790 
change it don't reverse the red as you
normally<00:02:32.940> would<00:02:33.150> a<00:02:33.300> real<00:02:33.660> one<00:02:33.960> because<00:02:34.650> you'll

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
normally would a real one because you'll

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.950 
normally would a real one because you'll
fry<00:02:35.070> your<00:02:35.340> unit<00:02:35.670> just<00:02:36.360> did<00:02:36.480> this<00:02:36.600> quick<00:02:36.840> video

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.690 
fry your unit just did this quick video
just<00:02:37.140> to<00:02:37.410> hope<00:02:37.560> maybe<00:02:37.890> it'll<00:02:38.220> catch<00:02:38.370> someone

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
just to hope maybe it'll catch someone

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.220 
just to hope maybe it'll catch someone
