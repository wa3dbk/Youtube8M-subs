00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
are torqued 125 foot-pounds so they will

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.340 
are torqued 125 foot-pounds so they will
be<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.880> little<00:01:57.240> hard<00:01:57.390> coming<00:01:57.719> off<00:01:57.840> so<00:01:58.079> I<00:01:58.140> use

this but just wood breaker bar to get

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.399 
this but just wood breaker bar to get
started<00:02:01.409> then<00:02:02.340> I<00:02:02.460> switch<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:02.969> like<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.270> an<00:02:03.689> 18

inch<00:02:04.649> one<00:02:04.979> and<00:02:05.369> then<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.549> ratchet<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.180> get<00:02:06.329> them

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
inch one and then a ratchet to get them

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.109 
inch one and then a ratchet to get them
off<00:02:06.600> you<00:02:07.380> need<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.740> car<00:02:08.069> up<00:02:08.280> high

so that you can swing the breaker bars

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.910 
so that you can swing the breaker bars
so<00:02:12.450> you<00:02:12.510> can<00:02:12.750> see<00:02:14.989> you<00:02:15.989> kind<00:02:16.260> of<00:02:16.319> see<00:02:16.500> how<00:02:16.680> high

at<00:05:32.310> say<00:05:33.030> 12<00:05:33.390> o'clock<00:05:33.800> going<00:05:34.800> back<00:05:35.030> 11<00:05:36.030> 10<00:05:36.240> 9<00:05:36.510> 9

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
at say 12 o'clock going back 11 10 9 9

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.180 
at say 12 o'clock going back 11 10 9 9
o'clock<00:05:37.650> down<00:05:38.130> to<00:05:38.280> 6<00:05:38.520> o'clock

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.190 
o'clock down to 6 o'clock

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:43.580 
o'clock down to 6 o'clock
remember<00:05:41.300> the<00:05:42.300> distance<00:05:42.780> the<00:05:43.020> circumference

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.590 
remember the distance the circumference

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.000 
remember the distance the circumference
or<00:05:44.010> where<00:05:44.760> would<00:05:45.000> that<00:05:45.030> start<00:05:45.600> go<00:05:45.900> if<00:05:46.650> you

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.010 
or where would that start go if you

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:51.620 
or where would that start go if you
punched<00:05:47.430> it<00:05:48.260> that<00:05:49.260> way<00:05:49.560> towards<00:05:50.550> the<00:05:50.729> center

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:51.630 
punched it that way towards the center

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.840 
punched it that way towards the center
line<00:05:51.810> of<00:05:51.840> the<00:05:51.960> car<00:05:52.229> then<00:05:52.500> try<00:05:52.740> to<00:05:52.800> put<00:05:53.070> in<00:05:53.220> a<00:05:53.430> new

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:53.850 
line of the car then try to put in a new

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.990 
line of the car then try to put in a new
stud<00:05:54.150> that<00:05:54.390> way<00:05:54.630> you<00:05:55.440> got<00:05:55.590> upright<00:05:56.130> you<00:05:56.640> got<00:05:56.820> up

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 
stud that way you got upright you got up

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.719 
stud that way you got upright you got up
right<00:05:57.590> here<00:05:58.590> is<00:05:58.740> the<00:05:58.890> only<00:05:59.039> place<00:05:59.370> that<00:05:59.400> comes

00:05:59.719 --> 00:05:59.729 
right here is the only place that comes

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:00.529 
right here is the only place that comes
close

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:00.539 
close

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:03.269 
close
but<00:06:01.539> it's<00:06:01.689> off<00:06:01.869> by<00:06:02.109> about<00:06:02.229> a<00:06:02.379> half<00:06:02.619> an<00:06:02.859> inch<00:06:02.979> if

00:06:03.269 --> 00:06:03.279 
but it's off by about a half an inch if

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:05.669 
but it's off by about a half an inch if
I<00:06:03.729> could<00:06:04.089> shove<00:06:04.479> my<00:06:04.659> finger<00:06:05.019> through<00:06:05.289> here

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:05.679 
I could shove my finger through here

00:06:05.679 --> 00:06:08.719 
I could shove my finger through here
it's<00:06:06.249> going<00:06:06.369> to<00:06:06.429> come<00:06:06.639> out<00:06:06.689> over<00:06:07.689> about<00:06:07.899> here

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:08.729 
it's going to come out over about here

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:11.459 
it's going to come out over about here
so<00:06:09.729> even<00:06:10.089> where<00:06:10.359> this<00:06:10.509> curve<00:06:10.869> is<00:06:11.109> of<00:06:11.349> the

00:06:11.459 --> 00:06:11.469 
so even where this curve is of the

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:16.549 
so even where this curve is of the
upright<00:06:12.419> it's<00:06:13.419> no<00:06:13.629> good<00:06:13.899> hop<00:06:14.799> right<00:06:14.829> hop<00:06:15.789> right

00:06:16.549 --> 00:06:16.559 
upright it's no good hop right hop right

00:06:16.559 --> 00:06:23.419 
upright it's no good hop right hop right
plenty<00:06:17.559> of<00:06:17.649> upright<00:06:18.629> wheel

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:23.429 

00:06:23.429 --> 00:06:25.619 

six<00:06:24.429> o'clock<00:06:24.579> we're<00:06:24.999> down<00:06:25.149> at<00:06:25.299> six<00:06:25.539> o'clock

00:06:25.619 --> 00:06:25.629 
six o'clock we're down at six o'clock

00:06:25.629 --> 00:06:31.319 
six o'clock we're down at six o'clock
now<00:06:26.139> we're<00:06:26.559> still<00:06:26.799> into<00:06:27.039> the<00:06:27.159> upright<00:06:30.329> not

00:06:31.319 --> 00:06:31.329 
now we're still into the upright not

00:06:31.329 --> 00:06:31.979 
now we're still into the upright not
happening

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:31.989
