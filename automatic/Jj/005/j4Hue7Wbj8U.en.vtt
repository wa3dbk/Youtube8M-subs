00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:21.580
 eureka this slice is composed of five 

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:23.160
 emissions the show you're going to see 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:27.419
 treats the inclined plane 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.419
 then there will be one on the lever 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:34.460
 followed by another one about the gain 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:37.700
 mechanics and friction then a 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:40.970
 on life it's the wheel and finally 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:43.250
 the one on the pulley 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:47.900
 but our story begins with the 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:49.040
 inclined plane you really have not enough 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.620
 of force to get up this barrel my 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:56.600
 man is it not that she is 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:58.580
 exerted to lift him and style he 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.880
 will therefore require a strength of at least 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:04.150
 800 newton to place it in the truck 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:07.330
 how far did it go about 1 m 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:09.710
 what energy would it take to spend 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.690
 good and well calculate bag 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.700
 energy is the ability to make a 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.460
 work work equal forces 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.710
 multiplied by distance 800 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.840
 newtons-yards of work or 800 toys 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.000
 work which is the same thing as 800 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.830
 joules of energy 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.330
 in fact it's not a lot but you do not 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.130
 can not lift this barrel there is 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.210
 something that may not be right 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.540
 because you have to spend your energy 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.220
 in one fell swoop if only you could 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.210
 loaded the barrel on the truck by 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:40.759
 small quantities 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:42.590
 if you could Sunday and in 4 you 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:45.080
 would then have four slices of barrels 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.700
 of 210 tons each is a reportedly 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.140
 need to exercise only a force of 200 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.260
 newton to raise what a 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.000
 Strangely it's inevitably you spend 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.800
 his energy with greater ease 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.409
 now you spread it over a more 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:00.200
 long time but we never 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.880
 nothing for nothing although the force exerted 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.500
 be reduced to one quarter of the 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.630
 must be applied to lift the barrel 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.430
 in full each time you raise a 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.369
 quarter of this barrel you exercise this 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.750
 force over a distance of one meter 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.010
 which means that you raise the 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.420
 four quarters of the barrel on a 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.200
 total distance of 4 m what you earn 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.720
 in strength 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.730
 you lose it in distance it's a kind 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.720
 changes over the distance is great 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:29.299
 the less you have to force 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.620
 nice of course you can not 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:31.580
 put everything in pieces just because 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.769
 that things are too heavy to 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.239
 lift if only you had a 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:36.600
 machine that allows you to exchange 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.490
 increase the list 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.910
 against the declines of the forts or 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:43.680
 the force here it is your machine bah yes 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.930
 it's good it's just a board but 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.190
 it is also a machine tries 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.550
 now to ride the barrel in the 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:53.580
 truck you 'll see why 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:55.350
 magic no no there's nothing magic you 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.580
 did exactly the same exchange as 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.210
 when you sliced ​​the barrel 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:02.700
 four the board these four meters of 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:04.050
 long instead of moving the barrel on 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.790
 a distance of one meter by lifting it 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.470
 vertically you move it on a 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.810
 distance of 4 meters pushing it on 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.090
 the board but it only took you one 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.310
 quarter of the force approximately ie to 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.400
 about 200 newton instead of 800 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.990
 newton but since places and 200 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.110
 Newton on 4 meters is the same thing 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:23.160
 than to move 800 newton on 1 m he 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.200
 will still be about the same 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.350
 amount of energy to move the 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.790
 barrel according to one or the other method 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.650
 that's why we can call it 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.300
 board of machines they do not diminish 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.400
 not the energy required to do anything 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.010
 thing but altaide to spend his 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.760
 energy in an easier way you 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.980
 think you just made a 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.660
 new discovery lifeless twice 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.200
 how do you think we built the 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.580
 pyramids 5000 years ago it was not 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.470
 really a board that did not use 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.460
 but a ramp of earth what 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.890
 exactly the same 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.150
 principles and uses the same principle 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.350
 you too 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.810
 every time you stand on a 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.160
 escalator because the board 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.890
 the dress of earth and the escalator 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.380
 are all three examples of the same 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:07.980
 simple machine type they are all in 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:09.240
 slope and they are ass this dish so the 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.720
 physicists call this sort of 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.900
 machine 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.490
 the trick place wins actually it was 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.080
 not exactly the term they use 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:18.900
 they use the word derived from Latin 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:21.060
 for door that is tilted and the word 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:26.610
 derived from Latin to plate and plans 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:28.740
 to give us that sentence so if 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:32.330
 you are afraid of lifts why do not 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.330
 does not produce the inclined plane 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.630
