00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 welcome to a tutorial in which you 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.519
 let's teach how to make a little heart 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:11.190
 with a ticket it does not matter if it's a euro 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.620
 of any country's dollar measures 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.780
 they are more or less the same and can be done 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.970
 with anyone and it also does not matter 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.460
 be of value that is right once 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.710
 we have the ticket we are going to fold 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.279
 first in three in half 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:30.269
 in this way we open and double through the 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.910
 half of the half on this side and by the 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:36.220
 another like that 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.400
 Now let's turn it around 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:45.329
 we are going to fold like this always having as 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:48.749
 reference the half line and so 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.380
 we already have this now let's catch and 

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:53.350
 let's double 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:56.460
 so this edge is flush with the 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:59.160
 line that forms the fold this 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.710
 we double 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.680
 in this way 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.200
 we open a little bit and leave the ticket 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.510
 well at a 90 degree angle 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.210
 now we go 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:15.620
 to catch open a little bit like that and we squeeze 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.170
 in this way to make us this 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:23.550
 fold and the same with this folded 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:27.480
 we open and tighten we will have something like that 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:29.280
 alright now let's fold this side 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:33.170
 A) Yes 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.170
 and this other side like that 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.190
 and now we take and take reference 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.910
 to this line 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:45.740
 that is all this we are going to double and that 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.740
 this peak at this height 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.950
 in this way if you can put it here 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.280
 down a little bit better so that 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.950
 be the form and the same with this other 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:00.750
 side we double 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.750
 and we introduce a little bit below 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.860
 and if we turn around we will have done 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.270
 our little heart with a ticket 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:13.490
 I hope it has served you well 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.490
 this tutorial a greeting
