kind of like tapering off of like we had
just<00:01:42.899> I<00:01:43.229> guess<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.100> album<00:01:44.310> even<00:01:44.490> before

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579

just I guess the album even before
forever<00:01:45.119> Halloween's<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.600> first<00:01:45.810> one<00:01:45.930> we<00:01:46.079> did

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
forever Halloween's the first one we did

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.950 
forever Halloween's the first one we did
independent<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:46.920> so<00:01:47.659> it's<00:01:48.659> kind<00:01:48.810> of<00:01:48.840> this

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
independent and so it's kind of this

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.450 
independent and so it's kind of this
brand<00:01:49.229> new<00:01:49.290> experience<00:01:49.890> forever<00:01:50.159> halloween

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
we carried it forward a little bit

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.899 
we carried it forward a little bit
farther<00:01:52.439> we<00:01:52.710> had<00:01:52.860> producer<00:01:53.520> brendan<00:01:53.820> benson

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.969 
farther we had producer brendan benson
on<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.299> record<00:01:54.630> we<00:01:55.020> tried<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.290> go<00:01:55.380> rock<00:01:55.619> as<00:01:55.860> we

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
on the record we tried to go rock as we

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.920 
on the record we tried to go rock as we
could<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.280> as<00:01:56.369> raw<00:01:56.640> as<00:01:56.670> possible<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:57.659> think

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
could and as raw as possible I think

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:58.999 
could and as raw as possible I think
that's<00:01:58.049> why<00:01:58.170> that<00:01:58.320> right<00:01:58.439> that<00:01:58.649> record<00:01:58.890> just

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
that's why that right that record just

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.580 
that's why that right that record just
has<00:01:59.159> its<00:01:59.340> own<00:01:59.460> sound<00:01:59.700> I<00:01:59.880> think<00:02:00.060> now<00:02:00.180> that<00:02:00.240> we're

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.050 
has its own sound I think now that we're
like<00:02:01.590> going<00:02:01.860> back<00:02:02.009> in<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.250> studio<00:02:02.399> and<00:02:02.610> having

loan<00:02:03.590> production<00:02:03.799> like<00:02:04.219> we've<00:02:04.340> done<00:02:04.460> in<00:02:04.549> the

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:04.609 
loan production like we've done in the

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:06.399 
loan production like we've done in the
past<00:02:04.759> like<00:02:05.030> really<00:02:05.539> mapping<00:02:05.899> it<00:02:05.990> out<00:02:06.109> and

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
past like really mapping it out and

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:09.460 
past like really mapping it out and
doing<00:02:06.829> every<00:02:07.009> part<00:02:07.249> one<00:02:07.549> by<00:02:07.729> one<00:02:08.289> it<00:02:09.289> really

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
doing every part one by one it really

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:10.660 
doing every part one by one it really
gave<00:02:09.649> it<00:02:09.709> kind<00:02:09.860> of<00:02:09.950> a<00:02:10.069> clean<00:02:10.310> and<00:02:10.550> really

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
gave it kind of a clean and really

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.300 
gave it kind of a clean and really
well-thought-out<00:02:11.830> approach<00:02:12.830> I<00:02:13.010> think<00:02:13.220> which

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
well-thought-out approach I think which

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.699 
well-thought-out approach I think which
we<00:02:13.459> haven't<00:02:13.640> had<00:02:13.940> and<00:02:14.269> at<00:02:15.230> least<00:02:15.410> for<00:02:15.620> the<00:02:15.680> last

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
we haven't had and at least for the last

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.580 
we haven't had and at least for the last
rack<00:02:16.099> yeah<00:02:16.430> so<00:02:16.879> it's<00:02:17.030> plus<00:02:17.840> I<00:02:18.110> think<00:02:18.170> John's

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
rack yeah so it's plus I think John's

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.330 
rack yeah so it's plus I think John's
head<00:02:19.430> space<00:02:19.640> i<00:02:19.849> think<00:02:20.030> it<00:02:20.120> was<00:02:20.390> in<00:02:20.450> more<00:02:20.930> of<00:02:21.049> a

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
head space i think it was in more of a

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.250 
head space i think it was in more of a
can<00:02:22.340> I<00:02:22.370> say<00:02:22.519> optimistic<00:02:23.299> I'm<00:02:23.629> not<00:02:23.750> inside<00:02:24.080> your

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
can I say optimistic I'm not inside your

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.960 
can I say optimistic I'm not inside your
brain<00:02:24.470> but<00:02:24.860> you're<00:02:25.099> gonna<00:02:25.190> happier<00:02:25.489> places<00:02:25.819> ah

brain but you're gonna happier places ah
yeah<00:02:26.599> i<00:02:26.629> think<00:02:26.840> the<00:02:27.049> band's<00:02:27.549> psyche<00:02:28.549> has

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.869 
yeah i think the band's psyche has
changed<00:02:29.750> from<00:02:30.110> each<00:02:30.290> album<00:02:30.530> i<00:02:30.769> think<00:02:30.980> pioneer

changed from each album i think pioneer

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:35.199 
changed from each album i think pioneer

of similar things that I have in the
past<00:03:02.450> but<00:03:02.840> I<00:03:03.109> tried<00:03:04.040> to<00:03:04.129> keep<00:03:04.250> things<00:03:04.549> light<00:03:04.760> on

say I think the fact that we still enjoy
being<00:05:38.539> around<00:05:38.690> each<00:05:38.930> other<00:05:39.110> I<00:05:39.440> think<00:05:40.069> that

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.190 
being around each other I think that

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.070 
being around each other I think that
first<00:05:40.400> and<00:05:40.520> foremost<00:05:40.610> makes<00:05:41.270> it<00:05:41.479> a<00:05:41.690> lot<00:05:42.020> easier

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 
first and foremost makes it a lot easier

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.020 
first and foremost makes it a lot easier
we've<00:05:42.949> always<00:05:43.130> kind<00:05:43.340> of<00:05:43.490> tried<00:05:43.669> to<00:05:43.759> not<00:05:43.880> get

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.030 
we've always kind of tried to not get

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:45.610 
we've always kind of tried to not get
caught<00:05:44.060> up<00:05:44.360> in<00:05:44.479> what<00:05:44.660> other<00:05:45.020> bands<00:05:45.259> are<00:05:45.410> doing

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620

be projecting and I think that it
ultimately<00:06:30.620> comes<00:06:30.949> down<00:06:31.220> to<00:06:31.520> what<00:06:32.090> your

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:32.360 
ultimately comes down to what your

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:22.810 
going to make it to six so I think we
pour<00:07:20.810> everything<00:07:21.229> into<00:07:21.530> like<00:07:22.430> you<00:07:22.550> said<00:07:22.729> we
