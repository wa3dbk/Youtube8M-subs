00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
miss chaining on this one if there's

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.190 
miss chaining on this one if there's
more<00:02:40.860> than<00:02:41.010> one<00:02:41.099> chain<00:02:41.340> and<00:02:41.989> to<00:02:42.989> draw<00:02:43.170> that

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
more than one chain and to draw that

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.290 
more than one chain and to draw that
card<00:02:43.590> effect<00:02:43.890> so<00:02:44.519> like<00:02:44.760> I've<00:02:44.970> been<00:02:45.030> saying

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
card effect so like I've been saying

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.580 
card effect so like I've been saying
like<00:02:45.540> a<00:02:45.569> lot<00:02:45.750> of<00:02:45.840> debt<00:02:45.989> problems<00:02:46.410> it's<00:02:46.530> a

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
like a lot of debt problems it's a

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.590 
like a lot of debt problems it's a
glitch<00:02:46.769> or<00:02:46.920> something<00:02:47.209> but<00:02:48.209> sometimes<00:02:48.390> I

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
glitch or something but sometimes I

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.729 
glitch or something but sometimes I
don't<00:02:48.810> get<00:02:48.930> to<00:02:49.019> draw<00:02:49.170> the<00:02:49.230> card<00:02:49.530> when<00:02:49.709> the

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
don't get to draw the card when the

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:50.720 
don't get to draw the card when the
effect<00:02:50.010> goes<00:02:50.160> through<00:02:50.340> in<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.489> graver

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
effect goes through in the graver

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.789 
effect goes through in the graver
judging<00:02:51.540> the<00:02:51.660> gate<00:02:51.840> so<00:02:52.049> I<00:02:52.080> don't<00:02:52.319> know<00:02:52.410> just

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
judging the gate so I don't know just

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:54.500 
judging the gate so I don't know just
let<00:02:52.950> me<00:02:53.010> know<00:02:53.100> in<00:02:53.160> the<00:02:53.190> comments<00:02:53.580> if<00:02:53.730> you<00:02:54.299> still

draw a cardinal no matter what three of
them<00:02:58.310> three<00:02:59.310> calls<00:02:59.549> just<00:02:59.910> to<00:03:00.000> recycle<00:03:00.480> your

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
them three calls just to recycle your

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.650 
them three calls just to recycle your
widget<00:03:01.920> Trevor<00:03:02.130> you<00:03:02.430> know<00:03:02.519> call<00:03:02.790> Hornets<00:03:03.180> go

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
widget Trevor you know call Hornets go

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.630 
widget Trevor you know call Hornets go
back<00:03:03.900> your<00:03:04.049> hand<00:03:04.230> so<00:03:04.470> you<00:03:04.500> can<00:03:04.590> do<00:03:04.769> that<00:03:04.950> you

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
know more of the graver exceeds first

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.240 
know more of the graver exceeds first
turn<00:03:09.000> so<00:03:09.180> this<00:03:09.360> is<00:03:09.450> pretty<00:03:09.569> good<00:03:09.810> to<00:03:09.900> have
