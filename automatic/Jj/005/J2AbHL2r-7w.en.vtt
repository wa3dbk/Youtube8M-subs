a<00:00:03.570> bigger<00:00:03.810> world

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.339

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:17.349 
Jones voice was very clear almost from

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:20.100 
Jones voice was very clear almost from
the<00:00:17.380> beginning<00:00:17.619> and<00:00:18.070> I<00:00:18.160> knew<00:00:18.369> because<00:00:18.930> she<00:00:19.930> was

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:20.110 
the beginning and I knew because she was

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.100 
the beginning and I knew because she was
a<00:00:20.140> farm<00:00:20.529> girl<00:00:20.939> that<00:00:21.939> there<00:00:22.689> would<00:00:22.869> be<00:00:22.900> a

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:23.110 
a farm girl that there would be a

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.800 
a farm girl that there would be a
down-to-earth<00:00:23.590> kind<00:00:24.579> of<00:00:24.820> conversational

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:25.810 
down-to-earth kind of conversational

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.009 
down-to-earth kind of conversational
quality<00:00:26.349> about<00:00:26.650> it<00:00:26.710> and<00:00:27.570> also<00:00:28.570> she<00:00:28.660> sometimes

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:29.019 
quality about it and also she sometimes

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:32.040 
quality about it and also she sometimes
has<00:00:29.320> these<00:00:29.439> long<00:00:29.769> run-on<00:00:30.160> sentences<00:00:31.019> but<00:00:32.019> I

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.050 
has these long run-on sentences but I

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:33.750 
has these long run-on sentences but I
also<00:00:32.290> thought<00:00:32.650> because<00:00:33.040> she's<00:00:33.309> a<00:00:33.340> farm<00:00:33.670> girl

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 
also thought because she's a farm girl

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.840 
also thought because she's a farm girl
who<00:00:34.180> reads<00:00:34.739> Ivanhoe<00:00:35.739> and<00:00:35.769> Dombey<00:00:36.400> and<00:00:36.430> son<00:00:36.580> and

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:36.850 
who reads Ivanhoe and Dombey and son and

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.420 
who reads Ivanhoe and Dombey and son and
Jane<00:00:37.030> Eyre<00:00:37.269> there<00:00:37.930> would<00:00:38.110> also<00:00:38.260> be<00:00:38.470> passages

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430 
Jane Eyre there would also be passages

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:40.920 
Jane Eyre there would also be passages
that<00:00:39.640> would<00:00:39.760> be<00:00:39.910> very<00:00:40.030> highfalutin<00:00:40.660> and

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:40.930 
that would be very highfalutin and

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.590 
that would be very highfalutin and
wouldn't<00:00:41.260> it<00:00:41.320> be<00:00:41.440> fun<00:00:41.710> to<00:00:42.100> put<00:00:42.820> them<00:00:43.000> both

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
wouldn't it be fun to put them both

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.049 
wouldn't it be fun to put them both
together<00:00:43.900> and<00:00:44.400> juxtapose<00:00:45.400> them<00:00:45.610> so<00:00:45.760> that<00:00:45.909> was

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:46.059 
together and juxtapose them so that was

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:48.119 
together and juxtapose them so that was
fun<00:00:46.479> from<00:00:46.690> the<00:00:46.780> beginning<00:00:47.290> and<00:00:47.680> I<00:00:47.769> hadn't

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:48.129 
fun from the beginning and I hadn't

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:50.369 
fun from the beginning and I hadn't
really<00:00:48.190> written<00:00:48.900> first-person<00:00:49.900> much<00:00:50.080> before

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:50.379 
really written first-person much before

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:54.840 
really written first-person much before
and<00:00:51.129> it's<00:00:51.909> great<00:00:52.269> because<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:54.250> don't<00:00:54.339> have<00:00:54.610> to

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
and it's great because you don't have to

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.990 
and it's great because you don't have to
describe<00:00:55.330> every<00:00:55.809> room<00:00:56.080> you<00:00:56.979> can<00:00:57.220> describe<00:00:57.610> the

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 
describe every room you can describe the

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.600 
describe every room you can describe the
thing<00:00:58.360> that<00:00:58.659> the<00:00:58.869> character<00:00:59.769> is<00:00:59.799> interested

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.610 
thing that the character is interested

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.020 
thing that the character is interested
in<00:01:00.729> in<00:01:01.059> the<00:01:01.239> room<00:01:01.449> so<00:01:02.080> you<00:01:02.799> can<00:01:03.010> really<00:01:03.580> move

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
in in the room so you can really move

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.170 
in in the room so you can really move
fast<00:01:04.869> with<00:01:05.290> first-person<00:01:06.130> but<00:01:06.640> then<00:01:06.880> there's

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
fast with first-person but then there's

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.050 
fast with first-person but then there's
also<00:01:07.390> kind<00:01:07.869> of<00:01:08.049> a<00:01:08.200> fun<00:01:08.500> thing<00:01:08.860> which<00:01:09.130> is<00:01:09.400> you

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
also kind of a fun thing which is you

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.690 
also kind of a fun thing which is you
want<00:01:10.299> the<00:01:10.450> reader<00:01:10.659> to<00:01:10.840> know<00:01:11.200> more<00:01:11.619> than<00:01:12.460> the

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
want the reader to know more than the

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.389

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:15.399 
main character knows and so how does the

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:19.440 
main character knows and so how does the
reader<00:01:15.640> see<00:01:16.390> past<00:01:17.219> you<00:01:18.219> know<00:01:18.340> the<00:01:18.609> person

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
that the main character doesn't know and

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.590

not talk so much so I thought of

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.999

but<00:03:00.230> then<00:03:00.409> when<00:03:00.590> I<00:03:00.620> looked<00:03:00.920> at<00:03:01.069> it<00:03:01.250> I<00:03:01.280> thought

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
but then when I looked at it I thought

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:02.920 
but then when I looked at it I thought
well<00:03:01.640> what's<00:03:01.819> the<00:03:02.030> book<00:03:02.209> about<00:03:02.390> and<00:03:02.750> it<00:03:02.810> was

well what's the book about and it was

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.369 
well what's the book about and it was
about<00:03:03.170> a<00:03:03.230> lot<00:03:03.530> of<00:03:03.560> things<00:03:03.890> it<00:03:04.219> was<00:03:04.250> about

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:05.379 
about a lot of things it was about

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:08.289 
about a lot of things it was about
feminism<00:03:06.379> and<00:03:06.680> housework<00:03:07.280> and<00:03:07.549> first<00:03:07.939> love

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:08.299 
feminism and housework and first love

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:12.789 
feminism and housework and first love
and<00:03:08.689> money<00:03:09.469> and<00:03:09.829> education<00:03:10.390> and<00:03:11.390> yearning<00:03:12.230> and

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
and money and education and yearning and

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:15.130 
and money and education and yearning and
it<00:03:13.370> was<00:03:13.519> sort<00:03:14.090> of<00:03:14.180> about<00:03:14.390> all<00:03:14.540> those<00:03:14.659> things<00:03:14.930> at

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
it was sort of about all those things at

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.920 
it was sort of about all those things at
once<00:03:15.319> so<00:03:15.620> it<00:03:16.280> wasn't<00:03:16.730> quite<00:03:17.090> as<00:03:17.329> little<00:03:17.659> a<00:03:17.750> book

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
once so it wasn't quite as little a book

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.140 
once so it wasn't quite as little a book
as<00:03:18.109> I<00:03:18.260> set<00:03:18.500> out<00:03:18.680> to<00:03:18.859> write<00:03:19.069> it<00:03:19.370> was<00:03:19.489> larger

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
as I set out to write it was larger

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:46.890 
as I set out to write it was larger
inside<00:03:20.659> than<00:03:20.930> it<00:03:20.959> was<00:03:21.200> on<00:03:21.379> the<00:03:21.439> outside
