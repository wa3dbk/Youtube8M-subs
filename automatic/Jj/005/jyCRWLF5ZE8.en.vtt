is<00:03:20.040> totally<00:03:20.250> crazy<00:03:20.640> well<00:03:21.240> I<00:03:21.270> thought<00:03:21.630> this<00:03:21.870> was

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
is totally crazy well I thought this was

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.690 
is totally crazy well I thought this was
a<00:03:22.110> very<00:03:22.440> creative<00:03:22.770> thing<00:03:23.250> and<00:03:23.490> very

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
a very creative thing and very

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.160 
a very creative thing and very
consistent<00:03:24.330> with<00:03:24.450> the<00:03:24.600> themes<00:03:24.840> of<00:03:25.020> the<00:03:25.140> book

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
consistent with the themes of the book

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.130 
consistent with the themes of the book
in<00:03:25.620> my<00:03:26.520> wife's<00:03:26.790> a<00:03:26.970> mountain<00:03:27.270> dew<00:03:27.390> drinker<00:03:27.840> so<00:03:28.110> I

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
in my wife's a mountain dew drinker so I

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.890 
in my wife's a mountain dew drinker so I
think<00:03:28.410> she<00:03:28.770> would<00:03:28.950> like<00:03:29.100> the<00:03:29.370> globe<00:03:30.300> very<00:03:30.630> much

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
think she would like the globe very much

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:42.760 
think she would like the globe very much
so<00:03:31.140> I'm<00:03:31.290> looking<00:03:31.440> for

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:42.770 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:50.250
