00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.089
 already then second episode of refreshments 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.370
 maybe someone turns on dc but i'm 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.610
 always the same this hair 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.799
 I had said do not expect gods 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:16.230
 but I wanted to make drastic changes 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.420
 then participate since I did 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.449
 the first is the first episode we do 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.560
 also this is also because precisely 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:29.210
 now I'll show you as usual 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.210
 I do n't know how the light will be 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.070
 you will be able to see well anyway 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:37.010
 meanwhile I tell you what happened 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.820
 the blows would be done this time 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.489
 Sun 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:44.210
 I changed hairdresser also because 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:48.350
 this is another that I was 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:53.210
 gone for short to talk for a while 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:55.190
 first interview and they had chosen how 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.570
 first place the other for now I wanted 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.510
 try this too as they are 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:02.210
 however close in short to have the 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:06.320
 vice to understand i'm well found ha 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.810
 made of the internal strokes of sun blows of 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.450
 internal suns therefore an effect 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.759
 surely you notice less more 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.759
 natural and in any case precisely on a basis 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:19.640
 always dark like mine because 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:23.450
 obviously I can't go by dal 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.759
 black to blond I would cut completely i 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:29.229
 hair would really be a 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:32.869
 disaster for my hair so yes 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:35.179
 always slightly slightly longer base 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:37.369
 clear but just a little bit and a little 

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:42.860
 let's see these highlights if you do 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:47.179
 they can see interiors hoping that 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:48.349
 see something and I like it anyway 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:52.459
 a lot because precisely 

00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:54.770
 I believe this is closer 

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:57.380
 the effect is still wanted 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.450
 however easier to maintain 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.179
 why you not even see the 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.890
 regrowth is not noticeable a lot and for 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:06.709
 what concerns the sunstrokes then 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:10.450
 I think it's better for why not 

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:14.080
 I want to go every time 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:17.800
 hours and hours and hours from the hairdresser not 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:22.330
 I can do it time and so I want one 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:24.519
 what is fast is fast not fast 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.500
 but that allows me to go by 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:30.190
 hairdresser not 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.000
 not every month not every month to make a 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.650
 such work 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:41.020
 then other things I shortened my hair 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:43.060
 of 444 fingers, that is, oh well now you there 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:47.280
 you will see network is fine you are not instead 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.280
 note wait 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:09.030
 yesterday practically after he got them 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:11.340
 cut benito caviciana anyway I have to 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.340
 say that I absolutely prefer this 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.140
 length is 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.569
 very much more manageable I am always 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.120
 very long yes but it is certainly a lot 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:24.360
 more manageable than the other and then 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:27.629
 I did cut them anyway it gives me 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:30.420
 the feeling of a more refined hair 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:32.519
 when it is even then right then 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.640
 maybe not including with me in a few 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:37.349
 month I do climb it though at the moment 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:41.910
 this especially with a hat like that 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:45.480
 along the hair too scarce 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:48.299
 the effect is too scaled to mimì di di 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:51.120
 effect I do n't know how to fuck that of 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:55.160
 befana that a little from me now 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:57.360
 I think I'll stay with this color 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:00.739
 hoping not to have to go back 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.790
 these words and slowly though 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:07.230
 lighten the color until done 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:10.739
 becoming common may remain a bit 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:12.840
 clearer but slightly lighter than 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:16.250
 therefore he must always remain a chestnut 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.980
 move away permanently from 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.690
 from the black he then has another thing he did 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:23.690
 fixed the tuft now the 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:26.870
 tuft I should have his visa 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:30.920
 touching the hair so I should have 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:34.070
 the tuft and slightly scaled me the 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:35.990
 tuft because it was the juice of 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.760
 bangs practically so it was not a 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.550
 real fringe was the fringe e 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.710
 he knows that now he comes here under the chin 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:46.250
 and that 's all, as usual, do me 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:48.530
 know what your vouchers are 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:51.580
 purposes for what concerns the hair 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:58.070
 if you want to stretch them if you want to do them 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:05:00.740
 I don't know fucsia if you want to shave I like it 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:04.430
 you don't like the shaved effect of course 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:06.680
 I never would have had it though I believe that 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:09.230
 be very nice on a girl anymore 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:11.630
 young like I don't know what to tell you like 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:14.540
 it's called that singer that they that 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:19.060
 it has the hair that has it really long 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:22.310
 and then one side is very clean 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:26.419
 I don't know how manageable it is 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:27.979
 the thing they say goodbye, however, I do 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:30.560
 like an effect I think it's a lot 

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:32.720
 nice i 'm younger girl 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.790
 of course we also need a beauty 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.710
 personality to bring in my opinion a 

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:39.290
 couple of the genus but it is beautiful then 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:42.020
 let me know what what you have in 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:44.660
 mind what you will do this fall with 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:48.560
 your hair now that you're back 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:50.150
 from the sea and with all the hair destroyed 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.800
 let's not hope not hopefully not 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:54.710
 we hope you have 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:58.130
 I really hope you have also protected i 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:06:00.320
 sea ​​hair all alone e 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:02.030

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.529

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:08.269
 design for your hair 

00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:08.269
 he said as usual a hello step
