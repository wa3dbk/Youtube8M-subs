00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.750
 First impression remains 

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:14.100
 very well 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.640
 says the saying that the first impression is the one that stays and I've heard a lot of people 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.550
 talking like this 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.419
 I received it from the first time I realized that the person and announced that 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:28.130
 Air I took advantage of my first impression does not deceive 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.189
 I knew it was going to be this way. 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:32.630
 The theory, I just did not tell you. 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.690
 resumes first impression a good first impression he left me 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.239
 Do you know what these people are? 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:38.199
 very simple 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:41.150
 our brain is made to 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:42.950
 give meaning 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.990
 and will baptize neither more sar and categorize all the things that people 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.510
 You see then when you see a person 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.810
 we make a first impression of her 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:56.320
 only our brains tend to be used 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.209
 it has a validation bias 

00:00:59.209 --> 00:01:02.880
 what is that validation bias what he thinks it is 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.829
 then he will do everything to prove that he is 

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:08.920
 so it is very difficult for the brain 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.990
 deny yourself or challenge yourself to each new attitude of that person 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.899
 it will take everything that serves to validate this first impression part 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:20.660
 reinforce this 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.440
 he will not take what contradicts what he found in the first impression 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.780
 so the first impression is the one that stays 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.640
 the saying that the correct one then means that they only make a first 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.510
 good positive impression 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.950
 then I can give a relaxed because the brain will continue to have 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.840
 in fact he did not complain he always tries to validate 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.650
 but from the moment 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.390
 wanted to understand what he gets new information that knocks everything 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:48.370
 what he 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:49.730
 believed before 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.910
 he immediately takes this as truth 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.640
 and then the spell turned against the sorcerer 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.580
 because it will start trying to validate that it will start to seek information 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.270
 go state leader 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.950
 new perception of him 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.460
 if it is negative 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.800
 he will start to see everything negative 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.089
 so much is that if a person likes you 

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:14.419
 she will always try to see the positive side of what you do 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.230
 if a person does not like you 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.509
 She will always try to find 

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:24.699
 a negative side or a bad intention feed a second intention 

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:26.069
 negative 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.039
 The longer you can do it 

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:30.140
 stay smart 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.050
 I make a good impression and hold on Monday and so on 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.709
 the works would cost to apply was at an upcoming opportunity 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.360
 Hugs and kisses to cope 

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:45.689
 you believe 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:50.079
 and what was your impression of the opposite sex I want to know leave comments 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:51.999
 It was terrible and kind of mean to me. 

00:02:51.999 --> 00:02:55.139
 I spoke with Roma the corporate communicator dot com br 

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:57.109
 It's always good to talk to you, thanks.
