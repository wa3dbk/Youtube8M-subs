00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:10.800
 and apologize to my lawn 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.769
 it's the old witch she has 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:21.600
 only no idea is no fun such 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:24.119
 to have neighbors what lost their sweet 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.529
 almost thanks for the attitude my super 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.160
 Radar takes what was there 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.160
 I'll be right back 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.800
 the hand away I can do that 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.800
 on time but my super ball sure 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:56.579
 I have to stop the car come on 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:01:00.789
 but it is a quieter 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:04.809
 who is the cutest little cat exactly 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:07.289
 you she is nice i think she was just 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:11.820
 a tooth would have 

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:11.820
 who is there on my bunny? 

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:25.420
 we are looking for a great home 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:40.610
 the girls I said only under 

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:43.759
 my lawn are not so cute 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.500
 Now, clearly a starched would last forever 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:47.270
 take a home for these poor 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.950
 to find homeless beds 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.770
 but it looks very much like old paper 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.619
 Here I find a nice home 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.659
 they keep 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:59.380
 wonderful and you 2 can anytime 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:01.849
 play and get the jewelry I 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.520
 I would say good neighborhood 

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:08.530
 A dog's look can sometimes do that 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.530
 heart open or the garden door
