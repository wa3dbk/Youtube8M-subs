00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.180
 today, Wednesday , November 21, both 

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.070
 bids crossing the stream 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.440
 of the drawer have changed their meaning and 

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:10.200
 these are the reactions of some of 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.690
 the citizens 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.150
 the daniel roldán libramiento from today 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.160
 crossing from boulevard las garzas to smiths 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.590
 and the juan de dios angle of forjadores a 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.930
 the herons for citizens these 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.759
 changes could bring benefits like 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.800
 improve city traffic over 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:28.919
 everything for the colonies that come from 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.009
 south with this the traffic could be more 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:36.690
 fluid well because there is more fluidity of 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:38.430
 the vehicles from here to pichilingüe here 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.000
 here they have here here we work 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.220
 we spend every day because it has 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.480
 surprised because like yesterday was the 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.570
 double meaning 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:52.410
 this surprises me but I think it is 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:56.460
 productive to avoid agglomerations in 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.970
 the traffic does not fortunately come to us 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.970
 early 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.519
 it seems good to me because it will be more 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.049
 fluid I imagine the works of 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.119
 repair of both warnings 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:08.780
 they finished yesterday night the 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:10.750
 traffic lights 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.070
 today they were in operation 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.670
 however for another part of the 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.080
 citizens 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.930
 these changes generated chaos 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.940
 vehicular motorists considered 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.799
 that the change was not viable because 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.840
 cross the stream going towards the 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:26.689
 salvatierra hospital did double 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.700
 of time that they previously did this 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:30.560
 was the row that was generated in the place of 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.960
 citizens who came from colonies like 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.740
 miramar santa fe- villas of charm and 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:39.560
 missions so a little too very little 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.659
 viable because they spend a lot 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:47.600
 Freight transport does not speed up the 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:50.780
 no more traffic circulation here 12 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.039
 minutes in passing the lousy really 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.020
 I'm doing triple or quadruple 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:56.659
 of time of what without crossing anything else 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.409
 this ford where it comes from here of 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:03.270
 missions and before how many and regularly 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:07.109
 then about 12 minutes to cross nothing else 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.700
 is the only one if the 4 is better in high 

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:11.310
 the place had elements of the police 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.140
 municipal however there were people who 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.970
 when not knowing the changes pretend 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.910
 cross the freeway thinking that still 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.590
 it was four highs during the next 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.420
 Public security elements days 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.970
 will be in place to avoid 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.220
 accidents in the area 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.989
