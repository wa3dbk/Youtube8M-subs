out<00:03:02.840> of<00:03:02.870> the<00:03:03.080> game<00:03:03.290> I<00:03:03.530> think<00:03:03.890> Arjuna<00:03:04.340> the<00:03:04.910> stand

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
out of the game I think Arjuna the stand

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.870 
out of the game I think Arjuna the stand
he<00:03:05.510> took<00:03:05.750> on<00:03:06.170> mooglies<00:03:06.620> behalf<00:03:06.980> was<00:03:07.280> was

he took on mooglies behalf was was

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.510 
he took on mooglies behalf was was
fantastic<00:03:08.510> I<00:03:08.660> think<00:03:08.690> it<00:03:08.930> was<00:03:09.340> exactly<00:03:10.340> the

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 
fantastic I think it was exactly the

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.520 
fantastic I think it was exactly the
right<00:03:10.550> thing<00:03:10.940> to<00:03:11.090> do<00:03:11.240> he<00:03:11.720> had<00:03:11.810> many<00:03:12.020> critics<00:03:12.380> at

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
right thing to do he had many critics at

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.290 
right thing to do he had many critics at
that<00:03:12.710> time<00:03:12.920> saying<00:03:13.130> oh<00:03:13.280> he<00:03:13.460> should<00:03:13.940> never<00:03:14.030> take

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
that time saying oh he should never take

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.610 
that time saying oh he should never take
your<00:03:14.480> players<00:03:14.750> to<00:03:14.930> the<00:03:15.020> edge<00:03:15.140> of<00:03:15.290> the<00:03:15.380> field

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
your players to the edge of the field

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.420 
your players to the edge of the field
but<00:03:16.520> I<00:03:16.550> think<00:03:16.940> the<00:03:17.360> stand<00:03:17.630> he<00:03:17.780> took<00:03:18.430> did

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
but I think the stand he took did

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:20.890 
but I think the stand he took did
wonders<00:03:19.850> for<00:03:19.880> Sri<00:03:20.150> Lankan<00:03:20.450> cricket<00:03:20.570> did

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900

differently there's a lot I've learned
from<00:03:48.110> them<00:03:48.320> because<00:03:48.650> I<00:03:48.709> did<00:03:48.890> both<00:03:49.010> of<00:03:49.190> them

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
from them because I did both of them

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.370 
from them because I did both of them
have<00:03:49.459> been<00:03:49.580> doing<00:03:50.269> the<00:03:50.450> best<00:03:50.630> captain's<00:03:51.080> was

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
have been doing the best captain's was

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.570 
have been doing the best captain's was
the<00:03:51.470> aspirational<00:03:52.130> Arjuna<00:03:53.890> as<00:03:54.890> a<00:03:55.160> captain

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:55.580 
the aspirational Arjuna as a captain

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:56.470 
the aspirational Arjuna as a captain
because<00:03:55.760> you're<00:03:55.850> probably<00:03:56.000> a<00:03:56.120> better<00:03:56.150> vets

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
because you're probably a better vets

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.460 
because you're probably a better vets
from<00:03:56.600> the<00:03:56.750> knee<00:03:56.870> was<00:03:57.080> a<00:03:58.000> captain<00:03:59.000> III<00:03:59.870> I<00:04:00.019> think

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
from the knee was a captain III I think

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.530 
from the knee was a captain III I think
I've<00:04:00.590> scored<00:04:00.830> more<00:04:01.040> runs<00:04:01.100> than<00:04:01.489> he<00:04:01.820> has<00:04:02.000> but

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
I've scored more runs than he has but

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.110 
I've scored more runs than he has but
you<00:04:03.110> don't<00:04:03.290> have<00:04:03.380> to<00:04:03.530> say<00:04:03.650> that<00:04:03.800> I<00:04:03.830> can

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
you don't have to say that I can

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.780 
you don't have to say that I can
III<00:04:05.630> think<00:04:06.350> Arjuna<00:04:06.890> was<00:04:07.070> one<00:04:07.310> of<00:04:07.430> a<00:04:07.550> better

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
III think Arjuna was one of a better

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.300 
III think Arjuna was one of a better
batsman<00:04:08.390> I<00:04:08.570> think<00:04:09.200> he<00:04:09.410> was<00:04:09.560> hampered<00:04:09.769> by<00:04:10.070> a<00:04:10.100> bit

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
batsman I think he was hampered by a bit

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:11.750 
batsman I think he was hampered by a bit
of<00:04:10.430> fitness

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
of fitness

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.119 
of fitness
and<00:04:11.849> I<00:04:12.450> didn't<00:04:12.689> hear<00:04:12.810> as<00:04:12.989> well<00:04:13.170> for<00:04:13.590> an<00:04:13.680> era<00:04:13.830> as

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:14.129 
and I didn't hear as well for an era as

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:18.409 
and I didn't hear as well for an era as
well<00:04:14.370> and<00:04:14.580> maybe<00:04:15.299> the<00:04:15.870> team<00:04:16.169> you<00:04:17.070> know<00:04:17.419> the

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
well and maybe the team you know the

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.390 
well and maybe the team you know the
players<00:04:18.690> at<00:04:18.900> that<00:04:18.930> time<00:04:19.260> might<00:04:19.949> not<00:04:20.130> have<00:04:20.250> had

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
players at that time might not have had

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.800 
players at that time might not have had
the<00:04:20.489> same<00:04:20.639> self-confidence<00:04:21.389> really<00:04:21.690> this

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
the same self-confidence really this

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.610 
the same self-confidence really this
place<00:04:21.989> now<00:04:22.830> but<00:04:23.790> I<00:04:24.300> think<00:04:24.720> Arjuna<00:04:24.990> had<00:04:25.169> had

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
place now but I think Arjuna had had

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.550 
place now but I think Arjuna had had
great<00:04:25.889> dreams<00:04:26.040> for<00:04:26.460> for<00:04:26.850> himself<00:04:27.229> and<00:04:28.229> for<00:04:28.500> his

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
great dreams for for himself and for his

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.290 
great dreams for for himself and for his
team<00:04:28.889> and<00:04:29.100> I<00:04:29.160> think<00:04:29.190> he<00:04:29.490> had<00:04:29.610> a<00:04:29.669> very<00:04:29.910> specific

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
team and I think he had a very specific

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.689 
team and I think he had a very specific
idea<00:04:30.840> exactly<00:04:31.470> where<00:04:31.620> he<00:04:31.830> wanted<00:04:32.220> the<00:04:32.370> team<00:04:32.550> to

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:32.699 
idea exactly where he wanted the team to

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:34.640 
idea exactly where he wanted the team to
go<00:04:32.820> and<00:04:32.850> what<00:04:33.180> he<00:04:33.300> wanted<00:04:33.630> his<00:04:33.780> team<00:04:33.960> to<00:04:34.139> do<00:04:34.260> he

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
go and what he wanted his team to do he

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.260 
go and what he wanted his team to do he
was<00:04:34.740> a<00:04:34.770> captain<00:04:35.010> much<00:04:35.280> admired<00:04:35.669> in<00:04:35.910> this<00:04:36.060> part

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
was a captain much admired in this part

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.520 
was a captain much admired in this part
of<00:04:36.330> the<00:04:36.389> world<00:04:36.570> I<00:04:36.660> can<00:04:36.840> I<00:04:36.930> can<00:04:37.110> tell<00:04:37.289> you<00:04:37.380> that

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:07.199 
same players not in that experience and

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:09.800 
same players not in that experience and
the<00:05:07.289> grounding<00:05:07.830> gave<00:05:08.039> him<00:05:08.669> the<00:05:08.850> ability<00:05:09.000> to<00:05:09.300> to

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
the grounding gave him the ability to to

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:11.420 
the grounding gave him the ability to to
lead<00:05:09.990> the<00:05:10.169> team<00:05:10.350> into<00:05:10.560> the<00:05:10.710> World<00:05:10.919> Cup<00:05:11.130> and<00:05:11.280> win

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
lead the team into the World Cup and win

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.360 
lead the team into the World Cup and win
it<00:05:11.550> and<00:05:11.880> I<00:05:12.180> think<00:05:12.419> from<00:05:12.570> that<00:05:12.810> to<00:05:13.380> 1999<00:05:14.039> the

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
it and I think from that to 1999 the

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.330 
it and I think from that to 1999 the
transition<00:05:15.000> took<00:05:15.840> place<00:05:16.110> and<00:05:16.410> then<00:05:16.530> 1990<00:05:17.190> now

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
transition took place and then 1990 now

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.219 
transition took place and then 1990 now
there's<00:05:17.610> been<00:05:17.729> huge<00:05:18.060> changes<00:05:18.090> but<00:05:19.050> tell<00:05:19.199> me

from the outside seems a more
homogeneous<00:05:27.150> side<00:05:27.630> and<00:05:27.949> is<00:05:28.949> that<00:05:29.280> is<00:05:29.430> that

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
homogeneous side and is that is that

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:30.200 
homogeneous side and is that is that
good<00:05:29.699> or<00:05:29.760> bad
