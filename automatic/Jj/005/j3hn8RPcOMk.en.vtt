all<00:01:30.210> right<00:01:30.450> I<00:01:30.479> wanted<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:30.960> do<00:01:31.079> a<00:01:31.109> video<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.890> I

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:32.219 
all right I wanted to do a video and I

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:34.309 
all right I wanted to do a video and I
couldn't<00:01:33.149> really<00:01:33.299> introduce<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:33.990> at<00:01:34.079> first

00:01:34.309 --> 00:01:34.319 
couldn't really introduce it at first

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:38.179 
couldn't really introduce it at first
because<00:01:35.299> all<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.509> generator<00:01:36.899> noise<00:01:37.170> but<00:01:37.950> I

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
because all the generator noise but I

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.020 
because all the generator noise but I
wanted<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.209> just<00:01:39.479> do<00:01:39.630> a<00:01:39.659> video<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:40.109> compare<00:01:41.030> the

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
wanted to just do a video to compare the

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.230 
wanted to just do a video to compare the
noise<00:01:42.270> level<00:01:42.780> of<00:01:43.200> kind<00:01:43.560> of<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.709> standard<00:01:44.240> you

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
noise level of kind of a standard you

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.169 
noise level of kind of a standard you
know<00:01:45.500> generator<00:01:46.500> versus<00:01:47.280> one<00:01:47.490> of<00:01:47.579> these<00:01:47.670> Honda

00:01:48.169 --> 00:01:48.179 
know generator versus one of these Honda

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:53.149 
know generator versus one of these Honda
generators<00:01:49.939> the<00:01:50.939> Generac<00:01:51.569> is<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.740> new<00:01:52.950> one

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
generators the Generac is the new one

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:53.800 
generators the Generac is the new one
for<00:01:53.340> me

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
for me

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:01.369 
for me
does<00:01:55.039> 5500<00:01:56.039> Watts<00:01:57.110> 240<00:01:58.110> volt<00:01:58.560> and<00:02:00.379> obviously

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:01.379 
does 5500 Watts 240 volt and obviously

00:02:01.379 --> 00:02:04.309 
does 5500 Watts 240 volt and obviously
is<00:02:01.530> much<00:02:01.679> bigger<00:02:02.329> this<00:02:03.329> generator<00:02:03.869> new

00:02:04.309 --> 00:02:04.319 
is much bigger this generator new

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:08.210 
is much bigger this generator new
off-the-shelf<00:02:05.159> costs<00:02:06.200> $650<00:02:07.200> I<00:02:07.500> got<00:02:08.069> that

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
off-the-shelf costs $650 I got that

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.999 
off-the-shelf costs $650 I got that

standard big box home improvement store
and<00:02:11.870> I<00:02:12.870> needed<00:02:13.650> it<00:02:13.829> for<00:02:13.920> my<00:02:14.069> solar<00:02:14.430> setup

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
and I needed it for my solar setup

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.509 
and I needed it for my solar setup
because<00:02:15.629> the<00:02:15.980> 240<00:02:16.980> mm<00:02:17.579> bolt<00:02:18.349> the<00:02:19.349> Honda<00:02:20.190> here

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
because the 240 mm bolt the Honda here

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:26.349 
because the 240 mm bolt the Honda here
is<00:02:21.920> the<00:02:23.780> EB

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:26.359 
is the EB

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:31.539 
is the EB
mm<00:02:27.359> I<00:02:27.769> okay<00:02:28.769> that's<00:02:29.430> very<00:02:29.549> similar<00:02:30.030> to<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.329> EU

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:31.549 
mm I okay that's very similar to the EU

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:37.370 
mm I okay that's very similar to the EU
mm<00:02:32.549> I<00:02:33.260> the<00:02:34.260> only<00:02:34.349> difference<00:02:34.799> is<00:02:35.720> it<00:02:36.720> this<00:02:37.170> one

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
mm I the only difference is it this one

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.240 
mm I the only difference is it this one
has<00:02:37.560> a<00:02:37.620> better<00:02:38.450> kind<00:02:39.450> of<00:02:39.889> protection<00:02:40.889> it's<00:02:41.160> a

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
has a better kind of protection it's a

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.809 
has a better kind of protection it's a
GFCI<00:02:41.760> protected<00:02:42.620> whereas<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:43.919> EU<00:02:45.079> mm<00:02:46.079> I

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:46.819 
GFCI protected whereas the EU mm I

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:52.220 
GFCI protected whereas the EU mm I
doesn't<00:02:47.819> have<00:02:48.209> the<00:02:48.419> GFCI<00:02:49.459> but<00:02:50.459> yes<00:02:51.239> but<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:52.019> EU

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
doesn't have the GFCI but yes but the EU

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.819 
doesn't have the GFCI but yes but the EU
mm<00:02:53.220> will<00:02:54.209> let<00:02:54.359> you<00:02:54.510> hook<00:02:54.720> up<00:02:54.900> directly<00:02:55.380> to<00:02:55.560> 12

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
mm will let you hook up directly to 12

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:58.159 
mm will let you hook up directly to 12
volt<00:02:56.040> which<00:02:56.430> is<00:02:56.579> a<00:02:56.609> nice<00:02:56.790> feature<00:02:57.000> and<00:02:57.450> I'll

00:02:58.159 --> 00:02:58.169 
volt which is a nice feature and I'll

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:00.409 
volt which is a nice feature and I'll
also<00:02:58.380> let<00:02:58.620> you<00:02:58.799> link<00:02:59.099> multiple<00:02:59.790> which<00:03:00.239> is<00:03:00.389> a

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:00.419 
also let you link multiple which is a

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:04.280 
also let you link multiple which is a
nice<00:03:00.630> feature<00:03:01.639> so<00:03:02.639> the<00:03:03.060> Honda<00:03:03.599> there<00:03:03.780> you're

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
nice feature so the Honda there you're

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.839 
nice feature so the Honda there you're
looking<00:03:04.530> at<00:03:04.680> is<00:03:05.150> $1,100<00:03:06.440> and<00:03:07.440> obviously<00:03:07.919> it's

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
looking at is $1,100 and obviously it's

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:11.500 
looking at is $1,100 and obviously it's
a<00:03:09.150> smaller<00:03:09.660> generator<00:03:10.260> it<00:03:10.650> can<00:03:10.829> only<00:03:10.919> do

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
a smaller generator it can only do

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.559 
a smaller generator it can only do
running<00:03:12.510> lots<00:03:12.750> of<00:03:13.160> 1600<00:03:14.160> with<00:03:15.060> a<00:03:15.090> peak<00:03:15.389> of

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
running lots of 1600 with a peak of

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:20.629 
running lots of 1600 with a peak of
2,000<00:03:16.849> so<00:03:18.829> just<00:03:19.829> to<00:03:19.919> kind<00:03:20.069> of<00:03:20.160> show<00:03:20.280> you<00:03:20.519> the

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:20.639 
2,000 so just to kind of show you the

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:23.030 
2,000 so just to kind of show you the
the<00:03:21.359> size<00:03:21.629> difference<00:03:22.139> and<00:03:22.379> noise<00:03:22.500> difference

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
the size difference and noise difference

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.979 
the size difference and noise difference
the<00:03:23.160> price<00:03:23.430> difference<00:03:23.879> the<00:03:24.510> output

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
the price difference the output

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.460 
the price difference the output
difference<00:03:25.440> the<00:03:26.370> honda<00:03:26.730> can<00:03:26.879> only<00:03:27.000> do<00:03:27.470> 120

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
difference the honda can only do 120

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.729 
difference the honda can only do 120
volt<00:03:29.280> whereas<00:03:30.239> the<00:03:30.480> gen<00:03:30.690> rack<00:03:30.930> here<00:03:31.260> can<00:03:31.530> do

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
volt whereas the gen rack here can do

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.479 
volt whereas the gen rack here can do
240<00:03:32.430> like<00:03:32.579> I<00:03:32.699> said<00:03:33.470> so<00:03:34.470> I<00:03:34.500> know<00:03:34.709> people<00:03:35.160> are

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
240 like I said so I know people are

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.059 
240 like I said so I know people are
kind<00:03:35.759> of<00:03:36.079> wanted<00:03:37.079> to<00:03:37.109> know

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
kind of wanted to know

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:39.709 
kind of wanted to know
you<00:03:38.129> know<00:03:38.219> what's<00:03:38.400> the<00:03:38.640> difference<00:03:39.090> and<00:03:39.390> and

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:39.719 
you know what's the difference and and

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:42.229 
you know what's the difference and and
is<00:03:40.109> the<00:03:40.469> Honda<00:03:40.709> really<00:03:41.219> worth<00:03:41.430> the<00:03:42.030> extra

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
is the Honda really worth the extra

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:46.399 
is the Honda really worth the extra
money<00:03:42.629> for<00:03:42.900> the<00:03:42.959> noise<00:03:43.280> I<00:03:44.280> think<00:03:44.700> it<00:03:45.090> is<00:03:45.349> but<00:03:46.349> I

00:03:46.399 --> 00:03:46.409 
money for the noise I think it is but I

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:48.709 
money for the noise I think it is but I
also<00:03:46.739> need<00:03:47.099> this<00:03:47.340> bigger<00:03:47.760> Generac<00:03:48.239> for<00:03:48.629> the

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:48.719 
also need this bigger Generac for the

00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:51.679 
also need this bigger Generac for the
240<00:03:49.650> to<00:03:50.249> top<00:03:50.519> off<00:03:50.730> my<00:03:50.760> batteries<00:03:51.389> from<00:03:51.540> my

solar I think the the web address is

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:20.979 
solar I think the the web address is
also<00:04:18.209> going<00:04:18.329> to<00:04:18.419> be<00:04:18.509> the<00:04:19.019> tiny<00:04:19.320> life.com<00:04:19.949> slash

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989

tiny<00:04:21.989> -<00:04:22.320> house<00:04:22.740> -<00:04:23.130> solar<00:04:23.690> but<00:04:24.690> it<00:04:25.199> basically

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
tiny - house - solar but it basically

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.529 
tiny - house - solar but it basically
just<00:04:25.949> goes<00:04:26.130> into<00:04:26.610> all<00:04:26.970> the<00:04:27.090> parts<00:04:27.419> of<00:04:27.479> my

00:04:27.529 --> 00:04:27.539 
just goes into all the parts of my

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:31.089 
just goes into all the parts of my
system<00:04:28.110> how<00:04:29.099> I<00:04:29.419> calculated<00:04:30.419> everything

00:04:31.089 --> 00:04:31.099 
system how I calculated everything

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:35.629 
system how I calculated everything
Dhokla<00:04:32.099> stands<00:04:33.080> panels<00:04:34.080> all<00:04:34.770> that<00:04:35.220> kind<00:04:35.520> of

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:35.639 
Dhokla stands panels all that kind of

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:38.839 
Dhokla stands panels all that kind of
stuff<00:04:35.759> so<00:04:36.210> I<00:04:36.840> figured<00:04:37.560> that<00:04:37.590> most<00:04:38.400> people<00:04:38.729> who

00:04:38.839 --> 00:04:38.849 
stuff so I figured that most people who

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:40.550 
stuff so I figured that most people who
are<00:04:38.880> watching<00:04:39.090> this<00:04:39.389> video<00:04:39.660> -<00:04:39.780> wanna<00:04:39.960> check
