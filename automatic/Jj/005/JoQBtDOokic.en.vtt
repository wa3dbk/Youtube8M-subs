00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.020
 hello thank you for watching our video now 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:10.559
 let's make a very famous roll that 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:15.560
 in california they call him character that 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:18.860
 it's been like a little worm of the role 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:21.410
 it is usually made with eel 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.990
 but as in this case we do not have it and 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:27.880
 it's easier to find shrimp we go to 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.880
 shrimp that I cook for sushi 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:35.080
 first let's put half of one 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:37.240
 roasted seaweed sheet with yore by 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.520
 where will the rice go we put water 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.680
 in our hands so that we are not 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.190
 stick the rice 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.740
 in my channel is how to do 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.180
 rice for sushi 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.180
 and all that 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.120
 and here we go and how to make the shrimp 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.470
 same here we put the rice we water it 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.290
 all right 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:04.180
 like california does with my video there 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.180
 is more detailed how to do it 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.909
 with bottom 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:14.740
 with a damp towel 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.600
 we are going to moisten the cutting board 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.930
 so that the rice is not you when 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.930
 we cut 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:28.000
 let's put a couple of 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.560
 the steps in this that covers a little 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.520
 of cucumber 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.520
 and shrimp 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.610
 if you want it spicy like this is the 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.670
 case 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.990
 it only puts a little bit of any 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.990
 sauce that you like more 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.990
 We rolled up 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.000
 from one bank to another but you have to 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.930
 stay before the shore so that 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.200
 can give in the return 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:06.390
 with these fingers what we have and with 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.390
 these three we press everything in 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.080
 so it has to be from this corner 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:21.150
 with the wet towel we occupy 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:25.890
 we just rolled it up has to be 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:29.880
 down there where it meets 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:32.740
 This is where comes the little trick 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:35.170
 avocado that we are going to put up 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:39.350
 with half an avocado and one 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:41.800
 spoon we have the spoon we take it out 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:44.400
 full 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.400
 here 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.700
 with our box 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.690
 we are going to lift it in slices 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.690
 delgaditas 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.930
 ah 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.650
 ah 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:03.079
 A) Yes 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.360
 better we give a little bit of what 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.010
 with everything complete 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:19.099
 and here 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.099
 and also with one hand we push it 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:25.700
 we are pushing him to leave 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:29.390
 spreading 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:32.599
 and with the knife we are going to get up and 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:35.050
 we are going to put it on top of our 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:35.050
 roll 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:43.719
 create you there are still sushi chefs 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:46.230
 that slip of putting of buenavista by 

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:46.230
 the bad life 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:56.480
 we put a puzzle on top of it so that 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:59.670
 that way it does not stick 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:02.099
 our bamboo 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.560
 and also we can not slice without 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:08.830
 problems 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:11.020
 we press it with these three fingers 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:15.210
 on the edges not in the middle because it 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:15.210
 He knows what he has inside the banks 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:25.600
 reproduces water to our knife to 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:28.630
 to be able to cut it and not stick the rice 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:31.390
 always the very important voice here for 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:37.650
 half to half the half and so 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:37.650
 We are going to cut 48 equal parts 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:46.910
 you can press again 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.910
 to be another is its form 

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:54.279
 when we put it on our plate 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:05:03.759
 we make it a way as if it were 

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:03.759
 a little worm 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.810
 if you want to put 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:16.160
 some arteries or something with years in 

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:18.460
 people 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:21.040
 As if they were 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:24.610
 some eyes 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:26.860
 Here is sweet eel sauce and yes 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.040
 can not get it you can put salsa 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.040
 teriyaki 

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:44.680
 of ornament something a little bit of 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:44.680
 of hot sauce 

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:52.180
 from above we have not dropped an eye 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:06:00.200
 and I hope you enjoy it many thanks 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.200
