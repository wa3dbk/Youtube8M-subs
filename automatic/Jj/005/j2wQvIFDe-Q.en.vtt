Angeles had a 4.0 on Sunday morning when

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.880 
Angeles had a 4.0 on Sunday morning when
I<00:05:10.920> was<00:05:11.190> still<00:05:11.460> there<00:05:11.730> it's<00:05:12.600> just<00:05:12.870> the<00:05:13.410> earth<00:05:13.620> is

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:13.890 
I was still there it's just the earth is

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:15.980 
I was still there it's just the earth is
shaking<00:05:14.430> and<00:05:14.580> quaking<00:05:14.820> and<00:05:15.240> the<00:05:15.330> Devils<00:05:15.750> back

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990 
shaking and quaking and the Devils back

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.440 
shaking and quaking and the Devils back
has<00:05:16.230> got<00:05:16.680> to<00:05:17.010> be<00:05:17.130> breaking<00:05:17.490> are<00:05:17.610> you<00:05:17.760> serious

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.450 
has got to be breaking are you serious

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:23.420 
has got to be breaking are you serious
and<00:05:18.780> so<00:05:19.590> now<00:05:19.920> this<00:05:20.430> huge<00:05:21.210> x2<00:05:22.200> class<00:05:22.620> solar

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
and so now this huge x2 class solar

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.380 
and so now this huge x2 class solar
flare<00:05:23.820> sending<00:05:24.810> CMEs<00:05:25.670> and<00:05:26.670> they're<00:05:26.910> going<00:05:27.240> to

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:27.390 
flare sending CMEs and they're going to

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:29.630 
flare sending CMEs and they're going to
hit<00:05:27.570> the<00:05:27.750> Pacific<00:05:28.290> Ocean<00:05:28.710> an<00:05:28.860> entire<00:05:29.190> Ring<00:05:29.520> of

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:29.640 
hit the Pacific Ocean an entire Ring of

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.640 
hit the Pacific Ocean an entire Ring of
Fire<00:05:29.700> so<00:05:30.180> keep<00:05:30.420> an<00:05:30.540> eye<00:05:30.660> on<00:05:30.690> that<00:05:30.930> in<00:05:31.080> the<00:05:31.410> next

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650 
Fire so keep an eye on that in the next

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.970 
Fire so keep an eye on that in the next
two<00:05:31.770> to<00:05:31.800> three<00:05:32.130> days<00:05:32.780> you<00:05:33.780> can<00:05:33.930> expect<00:05:34.410> a<00:05:34.650> lot

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:34.980 
two to three days you can expect a lot

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:38.230 
two to three days you can expect a lot
of<00:05:35.010> pressure<00:05:35.460> on<00:05:36.180> those<00:05:36.450> Teutonic<00:05:37.170> plates<00:05:37.530> and

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:38.240 
of pressure on those Teutonic plates and

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.500 
of pressure on those Teutonic plates and
all<00:05:39.240> that's<00:05:39.600> going<00:05:39.810> on<00:05:39.960> while<00:05:40.260> CERN<00:05:41.150> has<00:05:42.150> been

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:42.510 
all that's going on while CERN has been

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:47.240 
all that's going on while CERN has been
cranked<00:05:43.020> up<00:05:43.220> today<00:05:44.870> for<00:05:45.870> the<00:05:45.960> first<00:05:46.200> time<00:05:46.590> they

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
cranked up today for the first time they

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:52.550 
cranked up today for the first time they
collided<00:05:47.820> the<00:05:48.240> protons<00:05:50.960> for<00:05:51.960> the<00:05:52.020> first<00:05:52.290> time

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 
collided the protons for the first time

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.700 
collided the protons for the first time
since<00:05:52.830> early<00:05:53.300> 2013<00:05:54.300> they<00:05:54.510> actually<00:05:55.080> collided

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:55.710 
since early 2013 they actually collided

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:57.440

00:05:59.060 --> 00:05:59.070 
the CERN a little bit more in depth and

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:00.260 
the CERN a little bit more in depth and
I'll<00:05:59.130> tell<00:05:59.430> you<00:05:59.490> about<00:05:59.550> that<00:05:59.820> but<00:05:59.970> with<00:06:00.150> the
