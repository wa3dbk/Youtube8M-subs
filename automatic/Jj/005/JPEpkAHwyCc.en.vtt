00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.490 
grass trimmer will have no compression
it's<00:00:24.210> not<00:00:24.420> going<00:00:24.570> to<00:00:24.630> have<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.810> power<00:00:25.050> that<00:00:25.350> it

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
it's not going to have the power that it

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.740 
it's not going to have the power that it
used<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:25.769> have<00:00:25.920> as<00:00:26.160> well<00:00:26.460> to<00:00:27.390> give<00:00:27.570> you<00:00:27.599> an

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
used to have as well to give you an

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.529 
used to have as well to give you an
example<00:00:28.080> here<00:00:28.410> is<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.619> Husqvarna<00:00:28.949> 36<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:30.119> the

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
example here is a Husqvarna 36 and the

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.389 
example here is a Husqvarna 36 and the
top<00:00:30.750> end<00:00:30.929> is<00:00:31.080> shot<00:00:31.349> what<00:00:31.710> I<00:00:31.740> mean<00:00:31.920> by<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.130> top

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
top end is shot what I mean by the top

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.670 
top end is shot what I mean by the top
end<00:00:32.640> is<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:33.090> piston<00:00:33.450> rings<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:33.930> cylinder<00:00:34.530> and

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
end is the piston rings and cylinder and

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.720 
end is the piston rings and cylinder and
it's<00:00:35.309> very<00:00:35.670> easy<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.180> pull<00:00:36.510> over<00:00:37.520> so<00:00:38.520> if<00:00:38.579> your

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
it's very easy to pull over so if your

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.130 
it's very easy to pull over so if your
saw<00:00:38.910> is<00:00:39.030> easier<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:39.329> pull<00:00:39.540> over<00:00:39.750> like<00:00:39.930> this

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
saw is easier to pull over like this

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.869 
saw is easier to pull over like this
then<00:00:40.379> there's<00:00:40.590> definitely<00:00:41.309> an<00:00:41.430> internal

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
then there's definitely an internal

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.709 
then there's definitely an internal
problem<00:00:42.260> and<00:00:43.730> on<00:00:44.730> this<00:00:44.910> blue<00:00:45.180> line<00:00:45.360> here<00:00:45.390> the

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
problem and on this blue line here the

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.750 
problem and on this blue line here the
motor<00:00:45.870> is<00:00:46.079> seized<00:00:46.379> so<00:00:47.039> this<00:00:47.280> can<00:00:47.460> be<00:00:47.579> another

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
motor is seized so this can be another

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.290 
motor is seized so this can be another
symptom<00:00:48.420> of<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.840> damaged<00:00:49.260> piston<00:00:49.829> end<00:00:50.010> rings<00:00:50.300> so

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
symptom of a damaged piston end rings so

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.580 
symptom of a damaged piston end rings so

do that you have to loosen three screws
on<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.229> top<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:35.960> now<00:01:36.960> this<00:01:37.170> is<00:01:37.350> what<00:01:37.500> it's

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
on the top and now this is what it's

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.249 
on the top and now this is what it's
going<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:37.890> look<00:01:37.950> like<00:01:38.119> and<00:01:39.119> now<00:01:39.960> what<00:01:40.140> we<00:01:40.229> have

to do is look through the exhaust port

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.990 
to do is look through the exhaust port
to<00:01:42.479> see<00:01:42.689> what<00:01:42.899> it<00:01:42.990> looks<00:01:43.170> like<00:01:43.350> in<00:01:43.530> there<00:01:43.710> and

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
to see what it looks like in there and

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.609 
to see what it looks like in there and
I'm<00:01:45.000> going<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.240> zoom<00:01:45.479> right<00:01:45.810> into<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.290> port

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
I'm going to zoom right into the port

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.740 
I'm going to zoom right into the port
and<00:01:46.799> you<00:01:47.009> can<00:01:47.040> see<00:01:47.460> there<00:01:47.700> that<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.939> piston<00:01:48.479> is

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
and you can see there that the piston is

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:49.639 
and you can see there that the piston is
all<00:01:48.930> scratched

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
all scratched

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.530 
all scratched
unfortunately<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.490> motor<00:01:50.700> seized<00:01:51.180> so<00:01:51.479> I

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
unfortunately the motor seized so I

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.749 
unfortunately the motor seized so I
cannot<00:01:51.810> move<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.530> crankshaft<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.369> move<00:01:53.640> the

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
cannot move the crankshaft to move the

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.910 
cannot move the crankshaft to move the
piston<00:01:54.149> up<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.509> down<00:01:54.720> but<00:01:55.470> you<00:01:55.560> can<00:01:55.710> just

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
piston up and down but you can just

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.429 
piston up and down but you can just
imagine<00:01:56.040> what<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.640> rest<00:01:56.759> looks<00:01:57.090> like<00:01:57.439> so

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
imagine what the rest looks like so

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.069 
imagine what the rest looks like so
definitely<00:01:59.100> this<00:01:59.579> motor<00:01:59.939> is<00:02:00.210> shot<00:02:00.570> for<00:02:00.899> sure

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
definitely this motor is shot for sure

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.780 
definitely this motor is shot for sure
to<00:02:01.409> repair<00:02:01.770> this<00:02:01.950> you<00:02:02.130> would<00:02:02.250> need<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.520> replace

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
to repair this you would need to replace

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.179 
to repair this you would need to replace
the<00:02:03.000> cylinder<00:02:03.360> piston<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.619> Rings<00:02:04.829> and

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
the cylinder piston and the Rings and

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.639 
the cylinder piston and the Rings and
that's<00:02:06.060> not<00:02:06.240> cheap<00:02:06.570> sometimes<00:02:07.409> you're<00:02:07.619> just

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
that's not cheap sometimes you're just

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:08.930 
that's not cheap sometimes you're just
as<00:02:07.979> well<00:02:08.190> better<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.640> go<00:02:08.789> buy<00:02:08.910> another

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
as well better to go buy another

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.660 
as well better to go buy another

bolt and I'm just going to remove it
this<00:02:51.959> will<00:02:52.140> make<00:02:52.320> it<00:02:52.440> easier<00:02:52.770> to<00:02:52.980> see<00:02:53.190> in<00:02:53.400> there

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
this will make it easier to see in there

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.730 
this will make it easier to see in there
with<00:02:54.330> the<00:02:54.480> muffler<00:02:54.750> completely<00:02:55.380> off<00:02:55.500> like

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
with the muffler completely off like

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:00.440 
with the muffler completely off like
that<00:02:56.270> so<00:02:57.270> here's<00:02:57.540> a<00:02:57.600> close<00:02:58.020> look<00:02:58.200> inside<00:02:59.450> you

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
that so here's a close look inside you

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.030 
that so here's a close look inside you
can<00:03:00.660> see<00:03:00.840> that<00:03:01.020> it's<00:03:01.200> all<00:03:01.320> scratched<00:03:01.680> and

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
can see that it's all scratched and

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
can see that it's all scratched and
scored<00:03:03.890> now<00:03:04.890> I'm<00:03:04.950> going<00:03:05.130> to<00:03:05.190> crank<00:03:05.459> the<00:03:05.610> engine

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
scored now I'm going to crank the engine

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.850 
scored now I'm going to crank the engine
over<00:03:06.180> just<00:03:06.570> so<00:03:06.690> you<00:03:06.750> can<00:03:07.020> see<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.500> complete

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
over just so you can see the complete

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.070 
over just so you can see the complete
piston<00:03:08.340> and<00:03:08.520> ring<00:03:08.850> there's<00:03:09.180> only<00:03:09.360> one<00:03:09.600> ring<00:03:09.840> on

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
piston and ring there's only one ring on

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.640 
piston and ring there's only one ring on
this<00:03:10.320> piston<00:03:10.830> and<00:03:11.930> you<00:03:12.930> can<00:03:13.080> see<00:03:13.290> that<00:03:13.470> it's

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
this piston and you can see that it's

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:20.270 
this piston and you can see that it's
seized<00:03:13.980> on<00:03:14.310> the<00:03:14.550> piston<00:03:18.680> it's<00:03:19.680> a<00:03:19.830> bit<00:03:19.980> hard<00:03:20.160> to

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
seized on the piston it's a bit hard to

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.830 
seized on the piston it's a bit hard to
tell<00:03:20.489> if<00:03:20.640> there's<00:03:20.820> damage<00:03:21.269> inside<00:03:21.630> the

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
tell if there's damage inside the

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.720 
tell if there's damage inside the
cylinder<00:03:22.320> but<00:03:22.560> I<00:03:22.590> assume<00:03:23.130> that<00:03:23.160> there<00:03:23.550> would

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
cylinder but I assume that there would

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:29.990 
cylinder but I assume that there would
be<00:03:23.760> if<00:03:24.030> I<00:03:24.180> took<00:03:24.239> it<00:03:24.420> apart<00:03:28.400> so<00:03:29.400> basically

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
be if I took it apart so basically

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.820 
be if I took it apart so basically
anytime<00:03:30.209> you<00:03:30.510> see<00:03:30.690> damage<00:03:30.900> like<00:03:31.290> this<00:03:31.530> you

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
anytime you see damage like this you

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.770 
anytime you see damage like this you
know<00:03:32.040> that<00:03:32.250> there's<00:03:32.459> a<00:03:32.519> problem<00:03:32.730> inside<00:03:33.570> your

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
know that there's a problem inside your

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.780 
know that there's a problem inside your
engine<00:03:34.040> sometimes<00:03:35.040> you<00:03:35.190> can<00:03:35.310> replace<00:03:35.640> the

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
engine sometimes you can replace the

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.300 
engine sometimes you can replace the
carburetor<00:03:36.239> kit<00:03:36.540> and<00:03:36.810> replace<00:03:37.560> other<00:03:37.830> parts

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
carburetor kit and replace other parts

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.580 
carburetor kit and replace other parts
in<00:03:38.519> your<00:03:38.670> saw<00:03:38.940> and<00:03:39.269> it<00:03:39.720> still<00:03:39.989> won't<00:03:40.110> run<00:03:40.350> right

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
in your saw and it still won't run right

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.800 
in your saw and it still won't run right
because<00:03:40.980> the<00:03:41.160> piston<00:03:41.580> and<00:03:41.700> ring<00:03:42.000> and<00:03:42.239> cylinder

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
because the piston and ring and cylinder

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.860 
because the piston and ring and cylinder
are<00:03:43.019> damaged<00:03:43.500> so<00:03:44.269> after<00:03:45.269> seeing<00:03:45.480> a<00:03:45.600> scored

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
are damaged so after seeing a scored

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.210 
are damaged so after seeing a scored
piston<00:03:46.170> like<00:03:46.260> that<00:03:46.470> you<00:03:46.590> may<00:03:46.709> be<00:03:46.769> wondering

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
piston like that you may be wondering

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.190 
piston like that you may be wondering
what<00:03:47.489> should<00:03:47.760> my<00:03:47.910> piston<00:03:48.330> and<00:03:48.540> rings<00:03:48.810> look

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
what should my piston and rings look

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.979 
what should my piston and rings look
like<00:03:49.880> well<00:03:50.880> they<00:03:51.090> should<00:03:51.269> look<00:03:51.420> smooth<00:03:51.750> like

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
like well they should look smooth like

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:53.990 
like well they should look smooth like
the<00:03:52.110> other<00:03:52.320> side<00:03:52.650> of<00:03:52.950> this<00:03:53.070> piston<00:03:53.519> and<00:03:53.760> rings

the other side of this piston and rings
I<00:03:54.180> showed<00:03:54.390> you<00:03:54.510> earlier<00:03:54.690> and<00:03:55.200> this<00:03:55.860> is<00:03:56.010> what

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
I showed you earlier and this is what

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.949 
I showed you earlier and this is what
you<00:03:56.280> want<00:03:56.400> to<00:03:56.489> look<00:03:56.610> for<00:03:56.880> just<00:03:57.450> like<00:03:57.600> the<00:03:57.750> top

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
you want to look for just like the top

00:03:57.959 --> 00:03:59.690 
you want to look for just like the top
ring<00:03:58.230> here<00:03:58.410> it's<00:03:58.560> smooth<00:03:58.920> in<00:03:59.130> this<00:03:59.430> little

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
ring here it's smooth in this little

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.090 
ring here it's smooth in this little
part<00:03:59.940> the<00:04:00.390> bottom<00:04:00.570> ring<00:04:00.870> here<00:04:01.080> is<00:04:01.260> damaged<00:04:01.830> so

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
part the bottom ring here is damaged so

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.100 
part the bottom ring here is damaged so
it<00:04:02.280> should<00:04:02.519> be<00:04:02.640> nice<00:04:02.820> and<00:04:03.120> smooth<00:04:03.420> with<00:04:03.660> no

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
it should be nice and smooth with no

and in my hand sir I have another good

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:32.390 
and in my hand sir I have another good
used<00:04:30.150> piston<00:04:30.720> and<00:04:30.960> ring<00:04:31.199> as<00:04:31.440> you<00:04:32.069> can<00:04:32.220> see

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
used piston and ring as you can see

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.159 
used piston and ring as you can see
there's<00:04:32.610> a<00:04:32.669> few<00:04:32.910> Nick's<00:04:33.210> in<00:04:33.389> it<00:04:33.539> but<00:04:33.930> overall

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
there's a few Nick's in it but overall

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:35.960 
there's a few Nick's in it but overall
it's<00:04:34.500> still<00:04:34.590> in<00:04:34.919> good<00:04:35.039> condition<00:04:35.099> it's<00:04:35.759> nice

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
it's still in good condition it's nice

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.749 
it's still in good condition it's nice
and<00:04:36.240> smooth<00:04:36.539> and<00:04:36.780> it<00:04:37.590> would<00:04:37.710> still<00:04:38.009> run<00:04:38.220> inside

00:04:38.749 --> 00:04:38.759 
and smooth and it would still run inside

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:41.300 
and smooth and it would still run inside
of<00:04:38.880> an<00:04:38.970> engine<00:04:39.330> on<00:04:39.509> this<00:04:40.289> blue<00:04:40.530> lanterns<00:04:40.949> over

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
of an engine on this blue lanterns over

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.790 
of an engine on this blue lanterns over
here<00:04:41.490> I<00:04:41.520> suspect<00:04:41.819> that<00:04:42.330> they<00:04:42.630> ran<00:04:42.840> away<00:04:43.020> no<00:04:43.440> oil

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
here I suspect that they ran away no oil

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.339 
here I suspect that they ran away no oil
in<00:04:44.069> the<00:04:44.250> fuel<00:04:44.550> and<00:04:44.880> in<00:04:45.630> this<00:04:45.750> Husqvarna

00:04:46.339 --> 00:04:46.349 
in the fuel and in this Husqvarna

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:47.870 
in the fuel and in this Husqvarna
chainsaw<00:04:46.740> over<00:04:46.919> here<00:04:47.069> I<00:04:47.099> suspect<00:04:47.370> that<00:04:47.669> they

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
chainsaw over here I suspect that they

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.490 
chainsaw over here I suspect that they
ran<00:04:48.060> it<00:04:48.210> a<00:04:48.240> bit<00:04:48.479> too<00:04:48.660> hard<00:04:48.930> and<00:04:49.169> that<00:04:49.349> it

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
ran it a bit too hard and that it

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.740 
ran it a bit too hard and that it
overheated<00:04:50.069> another<00:04:50.910> reason<00:04:51.300> why<00:04:51.509> it<00:04:51.569> may

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
overheated another reason why it may

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.420 
overheated another reason why it may
have<00:04:51.900> blown<00:04:52.169> like<00:04:52.380> that<00:04:52.620> is<00:04:52.860> that<00:04:53.130> there<00:04:53.280> could

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
have blown like that is that there could

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:54.890 
have blown like that is that there could
have<00:04:53.460> been<00:04:53.550> some<00:04:53.849> carbon<00:04:54.300> on<00:04:54.479> the<00:04:54.660> exhaust

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
have been some carbon on the exhaust

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.689 
have been some carbon on the exhaust
port<00:04:55.319> and<00:04:55.500> may<00:04:55.680> have<00:04:55.830> broken<00:04:56.099> loose<00:04:56.400> and

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:56.699 
port and may have broken loose and

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:59.659 
port and may have broken loose and
gotten<00:04:57.150> inside<00:04:57.419> the<00:04:57.599> cylinder<00:04:58.400> so<00:04:59.400> if<00:04:59.490> ever

always scrape the carbon toward you
outside<00:05:23.069> the<00:05:23.280> cylinder<00:05:23.520> and<00:05:23.970> you<00:05:24.569> should<00:05:24.780> be

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
outside the cylinder and you should be

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.649 
outside the cylinder and you should be
okay<00:05:25.490> so<00:05:26.490> before<00:05:26.669> I<00:05:26.819> end<00:05:26.880> up<00:05:27.060> the<00:05:27.180> video<00:05:27.419> today

I'm just going to give you a few tips as
to<00:05:29.009> how<00:05:29.190> to<00:05:29.310> prevent<00:05:29.580> this<00:05:29.849> from<00:05:29.909> happening<00:05:30.150> to

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:30.870 
to how to prevent this from happening to

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:32.719 
to how to prevent this from happening to
your<00:05:31.020> equipment<00:05:31.259> first<00:05:32.130> of<00:05:32.370> all<00:05:32.490> make<00:05:32.699> sure

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:32.729 
your equipment first of all make sure

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:34.939 
your equipment first of all make sure
you<00:05:33.000> use<00:05:33.210> a<00:05:33.389> good<00:05:33.419> high-quality<00:05:33.840> two<00:05:34.530> cycle

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:34.949

or<00:05:42.479> forty<00:05:42.870> to<00:05:43.050> one<00:05:43.080> and<00:05:43.440> the<00:05:44.070> reason<00:05:44.310> why<00:05:44.400> it's

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
or forty to one and the reason why it's

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.129 
or forty to one and the reason why it's
important<00:05:44.880> to<00:05:44.940> mix<00:05:45.090> your<00:05:45.270> fuel<00:05:45.539> accordingly

important to mix your fuel accordingly

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:48.260 
important to mix your fuel accordingly
is<00:05:46.440> because<00:05:46.830> if<00:05:46.949> you<00:05:47.070> put<00:05:47.250> too<00:05:47.460> much<00:05:47.490> oil<00:05:47.849> it

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.270 
is because if you put too much oil it

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.420 
is because if you put too much oil it
can<00:05:48.659> cause<00:05:48.870> carbon<00:05:49.469> buildup<00:05:49.830> inside<00:05:50.070> your

00:05:55.339 --> 00:05:55.349 
that you just saw in those two chainsaws

00:05:55.349 --> 00:05:57.290 
that you just saw in those two chainsaws
on<00:05:55.620> the<00:05:56.340> other<00:05:56.460> hand<00:05:56.729> if<00:05:56.849> you<00:05:56.969> don't<00:05:57.150> put

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300 
on the other hand if you don't put

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.870 
on the other hand if you don't put
enough<00:05:57.330> oil<00:05:57.750> in<00:05:57.990> your<00:05:58.110> gas<00:05:58.319> you<00:05:59.069> can<00:05:59.280> also<00:05:59.520> get

enough oil in your gas you can also get

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.370 
enough oil in your gas you can also get
the<00:06:00.000> same<00:06:00.180> damage<00:06:00.449> that<00:06:00.840> I<00:06:00.870> just<00:06:01.110> showed<00:06:01.349> you

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:01.380 
the same damage that I just showed you

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.430 
the same damage that I just showed you
especially<00:06:02.280> on<00:06:02.639> the<00:06:02.789> pool<00:06:03.000> and<00:06:03.120> chainsaw<00:06:03.659> it's

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:04.440 
especially on the pool and chainsaw it's

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.170 
especially on the pool and chainsaw it's
going<00:06:04.650> to<00:06:04.710> cause<00:06:04.919> your<00:06:05.130> engine<00:06:05.250> to<00:06:05.460> seize<00:06:05.880> if

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.180 
going to cause your engine to seize if

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.570 
going to cause your engine to seize if
it<00:06:06.360> doesn't<00:06:06.750> seize<00:06:06.990> the<00:06:07.560> piston<00:06:07.979> rings<00:06:08.310> and

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:08.580 
it doesn't seize the piston rings and

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.760 
it doesn't seize the piston rings and
cylinder<00:06:09.180> will<00:06:09.569> be<00:06:09.719> finished<00:06:10.139> because<00:06:10.469> they

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:10.770 
cylinder will be finished because they

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:12.680 
cylinder will be finished because they
will<00:06:10.889> be<00:06:11.009> scratched<00:06:11.370> and<00:06:11.669> you<00:06:12.210> will<00:06:12.330> have<00:06:12.449> no

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:12.690 
will be scratched and you will have no

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:15.439 
will be scratched and you will have no
more<00:06:12.870> compression<00:06:13.500> another<00:06:14.400> good<00:06:14.610> tip<00:06:14.819> is<00:06:15.060> use

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:15.449 
more compression another good tip is use

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:16.909 
more compression another good tip is use
your<00:06:15.569> equipment<00:06:15.990> for<00:06:16.169> what<00:06:16.319> it<00:06:16.409> was<00:06:16.500> designed

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:16.919 
your equipment for what it was designed

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:19.370 
your equipment for what it was designed
for<00:06:17.009> don't<00:06:17.699> use<00:06:17.909> a<00:06:17.940> small<00:06:18.300> unit<00:06:18.690> to<00:06:18.870> perform<00:06:19.259> a

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:19.380 
for don't use a small unit to perform a

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:20.959 
for don't use a small unit to perform a
big<00:06:19.590> job<00:06:19.889> that<00:06:20.099> it<00:06:20.219> wasn't<00:06:20.370> meant<00:06:20.669> to<00:06:20.819> do

00:06:20.959 --> 00:06:20.969 
big job that it wasn't meant to do

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:23.719 
big job that it wasn't meant to do
because<00:06:21.330> the<00:06:21.659> engine<00:06:22.080> may<00:06:22.259> overheat<00:06:22.830> and<00:06:23.039> then

00:06:23.719 --> 00:06:23.729 
because the engine may overheat and then

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:25.850 
because the engine may overheat and then
cause<00:06:24.000> the<00:06:24.030> same<00:06:24.509> damage<00:06:24.539> that<00:06:25.349> I<00:06:25.380> just<00:06:25.650> showed

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:25.860 
cause the same damage that I just showed

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:27.980 
cause the same damage that I just showed
you<00:06:26.069> and<00:06:26.280> a<00:06:27.030> really<00:06:27.360> important<00:06:27.750> tip<00:06:27.930> for

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:27.990 
you and a really important tip for

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.140 
you and a really important tip for
chainsaws<00:06:28.650> is<00:06:29.009> always<00:06:29.400> make<00:06:29.610> sure<00:06:29.639> you<00:06:29.969> use

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:30.150 
chainsaws is always make sure you use

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:32.360 
chainsaws is always make sure you use
your<00:06:30.360> chainsaw<00:06:30.630> with<00:06:31.169> a<00:06:31.199> sharp<00:06:31.620> chain<00:06:32.009> because

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:32.370 
your chainsaw with a sharp chain because

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:34.370 
your chainsaw with a sharp chain because
if<00:06:32.520> the<00:06:32.610> chain<00:06:32.880> is<00:06:33.060> dull<00:06:33.300> it's<00:06:33.900> not<00:06:34.139> going<00:06:34.289> to

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:34.380 
if the chain is dull it's not going to

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:36.560 
if the chain is dull it's not going to
put<00:06:34.560> much<00:06:34.770> of<00:06:34.919> a<00:06:35.009> load<00:06:35.219> on<00:06:35.430> the<00:06:35.760> engine<00:06:35.789> it's

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:36.570 
put much of a load on the engine it's

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:38.600 
put much of a load on the engine it's
going<00:06:36.779> to<00:06:36.839> over<00:06:37.199> rev<00:06:37.409> and<00:06:37.740> it's<00:06:38.370> going<00:06:38.550> to

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:38.610 
going to over rev and it's going to

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:41.239 
going to over rev and it's going to
cause<00:06:38.820> the<00:06:39.060> same<00:06:39.240> damage<00:06:39.300> I<00:06:39.930> see<00:06:40.469> that<00:06:40.650> often

00:06:41.239 --> 00:06:41.249 
cause the same damage I see that often

00:06:41.249 --> 00:06:43.039 
cause the same damage I see that often
people<00:06:41.459> use<00:06:41.609> their<00:06:41.789> chainsaws<00:06:42.299> they<00:06:42.599> Rev<00:06:42.839> them

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:43.049 
people use their chainsaws they Rev them

00:06:43.049 --> 00:06:45.709 
people use their chainsaws they Rev them
really<00:06:43.439> high<00:06:43.619> and<00:06:43.919> the<00:06:44.489> chain<00:06:44.759> isn't<00:06:45.029> grabbing

00:06:45.709 --> 00:06:45.719 
really high and the chain isn't grabbing

00:06:45.719 --> 00:06:47.539 
really high and the chain isn't grabbing
so<00:06:45.899> it's<00:06:46.019> not<00:06:46.199> putting<00:06:46.499> a<00:06:46.649> real<00:06:46.889> load<00:06:47.129> on<00:06:47.399> the

00:06:47.539 --> 00:06:47.549 
so it's not putting a real load on the

00:06:47.549 --> 00:06:49.879 
so it's not putting a real load on the
motor<00:06:47.579> and<00:06:48.029> then<00:06:48.929> they<00:06:49.139> end<00:06:49.259> up<00:06:49.379> with<00:06:49.589> the<00:06:49.679> same

00:06:49.879 --> 00:06:49.889 
motor and then they end up with the same

00:06:49.889 --> 00:06:52.879 
motor and then they end up with the same
problem<00:06:50.069> and<00:06:51.019> also<00:06:52.019> do<00:06:52.169> not<00:06:52.199> rev<00:06:52.559> your<00:06:52.679> piece

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:52.889 
problem and also do not rev your piece

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:54.979 
problem and also do not rev your piece
of<00:06:52.919> equipment<00:06:53.519> with<00:06:53.669> no<00:06:53.879> load<00:06:54.119> on<00:06:54.269> it<00:06:54.509> so<00:06:54.899> if

00:06:54.979 --> 00:06:54.989 
of equipment with no load on it so if

00:06:54.989 --> 00:06:56.359 
of equipment with no load on it so if
you<00:06:55.079> have<00:06:55.169> a<00:06:55.229> grass<00:06:55.469> trimmer<00:06:55.829> or<00:06:55.979> a<00:06:56.039> chainsaw

00:06:56.359 --> 00:06:56.369 
you have a grass trimmer or a chainsaw
