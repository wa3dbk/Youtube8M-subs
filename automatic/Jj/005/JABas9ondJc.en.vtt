00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
know I think we let down in the second

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.270 
know I think we let down in the second
quarter<00:02:29.540> a<00:02:29.690> little<00:02:29.959> bit<00:02:30.110> and<00:02:30.290> uh<00:02:30.319> they<00:02:31.010> started

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
quarter a little bit and uh they started

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.620 
quarter a little bit and uh they started
to<00:02:31.340> make<00:02:31.400> a<00:02:31.459> run<00:02:31.730> and<00:02:32.000> that<00:02:32.180> we<00:02:32.330> don't<00:02:32.480> need

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
to make a run and that we don't need

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.360 
to make a run and that we don't need
that<00:02:32.750> what's<00:02:33.230> the<00:02:33.380> problem<00:02:33.620> defensively<00:02:34.190> it

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
that what's the problem defensively it

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:35.740 
that what's the problem defensively it
seems<00:02:34.610> as<00:02:34.880> though<00:02:34.910> it's<00:02:35.150> a<00:02:35.239> layup<00:02:35.420> drill

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
seems as though it's a layup drill
