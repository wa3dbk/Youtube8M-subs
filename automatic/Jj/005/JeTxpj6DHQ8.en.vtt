00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
first one is Venus and Venus is like a

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.250 
first one is Venus and Venus is like a
really<00:03:48.980> pretty<00:03:49.760> like<00:03:50.420> inner<00:03:50.720> corner

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
really pretty like inner corner

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.130 
really pretty like inner corner
highlight<00:03:51.290> color<00:03:51.980> it's<00:03:52.370> just<00:03:52.880> a<00:03:53.060> very<00:03:53.720> pretty

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
highlight color it's just a very pretty

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.979 
highlight color it's just a very pretty
white<00:03:54.739> and<00:03:55.070> to<00:03:55.519> me<00:03:55.790> it<00:03:55.970> almost<00:03:56.150> has<00:03:56.600> a<00:03:56.630> little

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
white and to me it almost has a little

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:58.420 
white and to me it almost has a little
bit<00:03:57.140> of<00:03:57.200> a<00:03:57.320> sheen<00:03:57.590> so<00:03:57.890> I<00:03:57.920> wouldn't<00:03:58.220> say<00:03:58.400> that

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
bit of a sheen so I wouldn't say that

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.160 
bit of a sheen so I wouldn't say that
it's<00:03:58.670> a<00:03:58.760> hundred<00:03:58.970> percent<00:03:59.090> Matt<00:03:59.570> compared<00:04:00.050> to

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
it's a hundred percent Matt compared to

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.070 
it's a hundred percent Matt compared to
the<00:04:00.290> other<00:04:00.440> five<00:04:00.769> but<00:04:01.459> it<00:04:01.580> is<00:04:01.730> more<00:04:02.360> like<00:04:02.660> a<00:04:02.810> map

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
the other five but it is more like a map

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.250 
the other five but it is more like a map
a<00:04:03.410> map<00:04:04.310> finish<00:04:05.060> rather<00:04:05.300> than<00:04:05.600> a<00:04:05.870> shimmery

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
a map finish rather than a shimmery

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.370 
a map finish rather than a shimmery
finish<00:04:06.560> but<00:04:07.100> yes<00:04:07.220> so<00:04:07.459> that<00:04:07.610> is<00:04:07.790> Venus<00:04:08.209> foxy<00:04:09.200> at

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:23.419 
skin it would not be a very nice

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:25.180 
skin it would not be a very nice
highlight<00:04:23.810> it<00:04:23.990> would<00:04:24.140> be<00:04:24.289> so<00:04:24.530> obvious<00:04:24.950> that<00:04:25.100> it

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190

was<00:04:25.220> on<00:04:25.400> the<00:04:25.490> skin<00:04:25.789> so<00:04:26.360> I<00:04:26.390> would<00:04:26.690> definitely

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
was on the skin so I would definitely

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.010 
was on the skin so I would definitely
um<00:04:27.850> recommend<00:04:28.850> foxy<00:04:29.240> if<00:04:29.300> you're<00:04:29.420> lighter<00:04:29.600> skin

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:31.850 
chocolate brown crave is just a matte

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.180 
chocolate brown crave is just a matte
black<00:05:32.360> and<00:05:32.780> if<00:05:33.169> you're<00:05:33.350> familiar<00:05:33.650> with<00:05:33.979> the

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.190

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:36.909 
black and if you're familiar with the
naked<00:05:34.430> 2<00:05:34.790> palette<00:05:35.200> blackout<00:05:36.200> and<00:05:36.440> crave<00:05:36.740> are

naked 2 palette blackout and crave are

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:39.159 
naked 2 palette blackout and crave are
definitely<00:05:37.400> dupes<00:05:37.669> for<00:05:37.820> each<00:05:38.090> other<00:05:38.300> they're

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:39.169 
definitely dupes for each other they're

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:41.469 
definitely dupes for each other they're
probably<00:05:39.410> the<00:05:39.770> same<00:05:39.950> formula<00:05:40.520> and<00:05:40.760> everything

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:41.479 
probably the same formula and everything

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:43.930 
probably the same formula and everything
they<00:05:41.660> just<00:05:41.870> kind<00:05:42.050> of<00:05:42.110> renamed<00:05:42.440> it<00:05:42.680> but<00:05:43.220> um<00:05:43.460> it's

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:43.940 
they just kind of renamed it but um it's

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:45.850 
they just kind of renamed it but um it's
a<00:05:44.090> very<00:05:44.330> nice<00:05:44.539> black<00:05:45.050> matte<00:05:45.320> I<00:05:45.560> feel<00:05:45.740> like

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:45.860 
a very nice black matte I feel like

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.240 
a very nice black matte I feel like
everybody<00:05:46.190> can<00:05:46.580> use<00:05:46.760> a<00:05:46.970> nice<00:05:47.150> black<00:05:47.479> matte<00:05:47.870> and

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:48.250 
everybody can use a nice black matte and

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:51.310 
everybody can use a nice black matte and
yeah<00:05:49.250> this<00:05:49.520> palette<00:05:49.970> is<00:05:50.090> very<00:05:50.360> nice<00:05:50.630> however<00:05:50.900> I

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:51.320 
yeah this palette is very nice however I

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.110 
yeah this palette is very nice however I
mean<00:05:51.710> I<00:05:51.740> don't<00:05:52.100> have<00:05:52.250> the<00:05:52.370> original<00:05:52.820> Naked

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 
mean I don't have the original Naked

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.390 
mean I don't have the original Naked
palette<00:05:53.150> but<00:05:53.840> I<00:05:53.900> feel<00:05:54.169> like<00:05:54.200> these<00:05:54.620> colors<00:05:54.919> you

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 
palette but I feel like these colors you

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.550 
palette but I feel like these colors you
could<00:05:55.550> probably<00:05:55.850> find<00:05:56.360> very<00:05:56.750> similar<00:05:57.260> dupes

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:57.560 
could probably find very similar dupes

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.830 
could probably find very similar dupes
for<00:05:57.680> so<00:05:58.340> if<00:05:58.520> you<00:05:58.760> don't<00:05:59.360> want<00:05:59.539> to<00:05:59.600> buy<00:05:59.780> this

00:05:59.830 --> 00:05:59.840 
for so if you don't want to buy this

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.570 
for so if you don't want to buy this

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:01.580 
because you have the other two naked

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.219 
because you have the other two naked
palettes<00:06:02.060> I<00:06:02.150> definitely<00:06:02.390> would<00:06:02.690> not<00:06:02.810> say<00:06:03.050> that

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:03.229
