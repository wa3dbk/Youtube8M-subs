here and to make this ammo clip it's a

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.660 
here and to make this ammo clip it's a
little<00:00:59.789> more<00:00:59.969> complicated<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:01.020> it<00:01:01.170> curves

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
up because like if you use it the blue

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.400 
up because like if you use it the blue
but<00:01:59.270> doesn't<00:01:59.540> really<00:01:59.660> matter<00:01:59.900> but<00:02:00.140> I<00:02:00.170> like

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 
look at it carefully it's kind of easy

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.230 
look at it carefully it's kind of easy
to<00:02:09.590> make<00:02:09.979> the<00:02:10.130> m16<00:02:10.759> it's<00:02:10.940> only<00:02:11.920> two<00:02:12.920> sides<00:02:13.240> you

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
to make the m16 it's only two sides you

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.060 
to make the m16 it's only two sides you
make<00:02:14.420> two<00:02:14.810> and<00:02:16.510> it's<00:02:17.510> kind<00:02:17.840> of<00:02:17.900> easy<00:02:18.140> so<00:02:18.560> I<00:02:18.770> just

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070
