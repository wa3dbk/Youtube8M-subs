and he found that when women are
pregnant<00:01:03.780> this<00:01:04.260> HCG<00:01:04.860> is<00:01:04.979> present<00:01:05.430> and

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
pregnant this HCG is present and

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
basically what HCG does does two things

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.580 
basically what HCG does does two things
this<00:01:08.970> is<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.119> hormone<00:01:09.540> that's<00:01:10.049> only<00:01:10.409> available

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
this is a hormone that's only available

little while after she has a child and
it<00:01:14.490> goes<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:14.909> hypothalamus<00:01:15.780> of<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.020> brain

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
it goes to the hypothalamus of the brain

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.140 
it goes to the hypothalamus of the brain
which<00:01:16.680> is<00:01:16.710> master<00:01:17.340> controller<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.970> whole

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
and we can burn off this excess fat that

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.660 
and we can burn off this excess fat that
you<00:01:36.869> accumulated<00:01:37.500> during<00:01:38.100> having<00:01:38.549> this

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
you accumulated during having this

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.940 
you accumulated during having this
healthy<00:01:39.270> child<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:40.259> second<00:01:40.590> thing<00:01:40.680> that<00:01:40.740> it

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
healthy child the second thing that it

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.800 
healthy child the second thing that it
does<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.460> tells<00:01:41.759> your<00:01:41.880> body<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.150> use<00:01:42.420> mostly

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
does it tells your body to use mostly

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.700

yellow<00:01:43.170> fat<00:01:43.530> for<00:01:44.250> fuel<00:01:44.780> so<00:01:45.780> we<00:01:45.899> use<00:01:46.049> that<00:01:46.290> first

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
yellow fat for fuel so we use that first

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.560 
yellow fat for fuel so we use that first
so<00:01:47.340> when<00:01:47.520> I<00:01:47.549> first<00:01:47.790> heard<00:01:47.970> of<00:01:48.090> this<00:01:48.180> diet<00:01:48.420> was
