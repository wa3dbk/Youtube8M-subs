00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
so anyway I wasn't too happy with that

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.260 
so anyway I wasn't too happy with that
so<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:01.530> kind<00:01:02.129> of<00:01:02.219> created<00:01:02.609> my<00:01:02.699> own<00:01:02.730> like<00:01:03.000> I<00:01:03.090> said

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
so I kind of created my own like I said

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.170 
so I kind of created my own like I said
hybrid<00:01:03.660> so<00:01:03.870> this<00:01:04.019> guy<00:01:04.229> is<00:01:04.790> basically<00:01:05.790> a

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
hybrid so this guy is basically a

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.149 
hybrid so this guy is basically a
shredded<00:01:06.659> cannon<00:01:07.080> he's<00:01:07.260> half<00:01:07.530> tank<00:01:07.860> half

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
shredded cannon he's half tank half

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.060 
shredded cannon he's half tank half
cannon<00:01:08.810> he<00:01:09.810> can<00:01:09.990> roll<00:01:10.140> over<00:01:10.170> on<00:01:10.409> his<00:01:10.650> own<00:01:10.830> or

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
cannon he can roll over on his own or

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.530 
cannon he can roll over on his own or
you<00:01:11.159> can<00:01:11.280> see<00:01:11.400> at<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.580> back<00:01:11.760> he<00:01:11.939> has<00:01:11.970> handles

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
you can see at the back he has handles

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.249 
you can see at the back he has handles
so<00:01:12.659> other<00:01:12.869> transformers<00:01:13.590> can<00:01:14.310> operate<00:01:14.909> him<00:01:15.259> so

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
so other transformers can operate him so

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.749 
so other transformers can operate him so
let's<00:01:16.470> get<00:01:16.650> right<00:01:16.799> transformation<00:01:17.549> because

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
let's get right transformation because

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.050 
let's get right transformation because
robot<00:01:18.540> mode<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:18.720> really<00:01:19.140> cool<00:01:19.790> the<00:01:20.790> first

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
robot mode is really cool the first

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.179 
robot mode is really cool the first

want to flip down these arms they're on
ratchet<00:02:45.930> joints<00:02:46.290> and<00:02:46.500> then<00:02:47.310> they're<00:02:47.489> on<00:02:47.610> ball

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
ratchet joints and then they're on ball

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:50.930 
ratchet joints and then they're on ball
joints<00:02:48.209> to<00:02:48.360> get<00:02:48.480> the<00:02:48.660> the<00:02:49.230> articulation<00:02:50.129> for

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
joints to get the the articulation for

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.759 
joints to get the the articulation for
cool<00:02:51.150> pose<00:02:51.450> ability<00:02:51.959> the<00:02:52.230> same<00:02:52.500> to<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.739> other

but<00:02:57.569> actually<00:02:57.930> what<00:02:58.079> I<00:02:58.109> do<00:02:58.260> is<00:02:58.410> take<00:02:58.620> out<00:02:58.859> these

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
but actually what I do is take out these

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:01.610 
but actually what I do is take out these
sections<00:02:59.670> here<00:02:59.790> this<00:03:00.510> is<00:03:00.690> from<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:01.019> concept

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
sections here this is from the concept

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.650 
sections here this is from the concept
art<00:03:01.769> the<00:03:02.609> original<00:03:02.940> you<00:03:03.090> and<00:03:03.269> toy<00:03:03.420> remember

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
art the original you and toy remember

you<00:03:03.930> had<00:03:04.139> to<00:03:04.170> remove<00:03:04.620> that<00:03:04.799> whole<00:03:06.739> muzzles<00:03:07.739> by

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
you had to remove that whole muzzles by

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.059 
you had to remove that whole muzzles by
the<00:03:08.040> front<00:03:08.930> silencer<00:03:09.930> kind<00:03:10.170> of<00:03:10.319> thing<00:03:10.950> in

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
the front silencer kind of thing in

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.490 
the front silencer kind of thing in
laser<00:03:11.280> mode<00:03:11.579> so<00:03:12.450> you<00:03:12.480> can<00:03:12.599> see<00:03:12.750> the<00:03:12.870> hand<00:03:13.109> here

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
laser mode so you can see the hand here

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.759 
laser mode so you can see the hand here
is<00:03:14.489> the<00:03:14.670> same<00:03:14.880> as<00:03:14.910> many<00:03:15.269> usual<00:03:15.690> hands<00:03:16.109> so<00:03:16.319> you
