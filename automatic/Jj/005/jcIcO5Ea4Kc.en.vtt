thur inferno sorry that was like the
weirdest<00:02:18.480> sentence<00:02:18.750> I've<00:02:18.870> ever<00:02:18.990> said<00:02:19.200> um<00:02:19.760> and

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
weirdest sentence I've ever said um and

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.310 
weirdest sentence I've ever said um and
I<00:02:21.180> wasn't<00:02:21.360> too<00:02:21.570> sure<00:02:21.600> if<00:02:21.780> he<00:02:21.870> was<00:02:21.960> acting<00:02:22.230> or

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
I wasn't too sure if he was acting or

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.040 
I wasn't too sure if he was acting or
not<00:02:22.440> but<00:02:22.800> he<00:02:23.100> was<00:02:23.280> like<00:02:23.550> flicking<00:02:24.300> his<00:02:24.510> cross

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.580 

like<00:02:32.190> it's<00:02:32.340> insane<00:02:32.700> dude

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.800 

I<00:02:37.060> don't<00:02:38.060> know<00:02:38.120> I<00:02:38.150> feel<00:02:38.390> like<00:02:38.510> this<00:02:38.660> is<00:02:38.780> a

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
I don't know I feel like this is a

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.670 
I don't know I feel like this is a
really<00:02:39.140> bad<00:02:39.349> ESP<00:02:40.030> um<00:02:41.110> or<00:02:42.110> he's<00:02:42.290> just<00:02:42.440> wall

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
really bad ESP um or he's just wall

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.320 
really bad ESP um or he's just wall
hacking<00:02:43.040> and<00:02:43.160> he's<00:02:43.250> just<00:02:43.459> really<00:02:43.700> stat<00:02:44.060> this

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
hacking and he's just really stat this

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.570 
hacking and he's just really stat this
is<00:02:44.569> this<00:02:44.690> really<00:02:44.930> spastic<00:02:45.590> with<00:02:45.830> his<00:02:45.980> mouse<00:02:46.250> I

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
is this really spastic with his mouse I

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.430 
is this really spastic with his mouse I
guess<00:02:47.300> it's<00:02:47.480> all<00:02:47.629> something<00:02:48.050> that<00:02:48.230> could<00:02:48.349> be

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
guess it's all something that could be

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.650 
guess it's all something that could be
possible<00:02:48.730> but<00:02:49.730> anyways<00:02:50.030> if<00:02:50.150> I<00:02:50.239> went<00:02:50.420> against

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
possible but anyways if I went against

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.210 
possible but anyways if I went against
this<00:02:50.810> guy<00:02:51.050> and<00:02:51.319> he<00:02:51.470> was<00:02:51.590> on<00:02:51.680> the<00:02:51.709> enemy<00:02:51.890> team<00:02:52.040> I

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
this guy and he was on the enemy team I

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.890 
this guy and he was on the enemy team I
probably<00:02:52.849> he<00:02:53.150> probably<00:02:53.420> wouldn't<00:02:53.780> he

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
probably he probably wouldn't he

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.150 
probably he probably wouldn't he
probably<00:02:54.140> wouldn't<00:02:54.440> be<00:02:54.560> doing<00:02:54.799> good<00:02:54.920> at<00:02:55.040> all

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
probably wouldn't be doing good at all

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.520 
probably wouldn't be doing good at all
because<00:02:55.790> um<00:02:56.239> let's<00:02:56.629> see<00:02:56.810> what<00:02:56.959> the<00:02:57.049> kills<00:02:57.290> are

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
because um let's see what the kills are

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.589 
because um let's see what the kills are
I<00:02:57.860> can't<00:02:58.549> when<00:02:58.700> this<00:02:58.790> Des<00:02:58.940> Moines<00:02:59.120> thing<00:02:59.330> is<00:02:59.450> in

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
I can't when this Des Moines thing is in

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:02.470 
I can't when this Des Moines thing is in
the<00:02:59.690> way<00:02:59.840> whatever<00:03:00.620> i'll<00:03:00.830> look<00:03:00.950> later<00:03:01.299> he<00:03:02.299> gets

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
the way whatever i'll look later he gets

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.570 
the way whatever i'll look later he gets
killed<00:03:02.720> through<00:03:02.989> the<00:03:03.110> middle<00:03:03.440> or<00:03:03.709> through<00:03:03.890> mid

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
killed through the middle or through mid

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.640 
killed through the middle or through mid
because<00:03:05.030> he's<00:03:05.900> careless<00:03:06.200> and<00:03:06.650> stupid<00:03:07.569> um<00:03:08.650> I'm
