00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:06.870
 Hello friends from youtube 

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:11.530
 Today I'm going to show you how we're going to do 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:15.060
 a dry louse and a paper plane that is 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.060
 an art project paper 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:22.090
 to be pulled louse needs 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:25.060
 on your own 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:28.230
 we do this 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:31.760
 and stay straight 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.870
 so to return more 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.870
 they have rights 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:49.170
 do the same for the other side that 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:49.170
 they have the right 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.050
 West 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.450
 yes and right 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.450
 ah 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:11.640
 look how is running all do this 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.570
 now the two ends of this form and the 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.920
 cloud 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:20.380
 only you 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.380
 and this is well right 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.840
 and then they start doing this 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.760
 thus 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.780
 and there are also rights 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.480
 right is like that 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:49.130
 moves to volt 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.130
 and it is wrapped to fly 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:00.570
 now if you want it to sound more one of the 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.500
 it has to sound crushing a light 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:07.770
 you already know that this is racist and the 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.340
 index very well here true the finger 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.340
 cancel 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:18.140
 and the thumb here 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.140
 or also in this way 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:28.280
 but suggested is for them to sound and 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:31.250
 then they do for and station before 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:34.940
 now let's do 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:37.940
 page action 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.520
 is another art project the plane of 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.569
 paper 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.370
 first let's do this 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:48.560
 as if we were starting as the 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.560
 shaka louse too that fits right 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:58.200
 but being a single 'break' 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.200
 to the right the police 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.340
 it's formed 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.610
 good 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.800
 here 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:16.319
 and also what rightists 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:19.670
 of three doses do not flip 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.670
 and it had to be like that 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.340
 same 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:41.810
 today 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:46.300
 in this to make the wings good hands 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.300
 then they turn it over and do the same 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.720
 this is the way it is based 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.150
 where easy 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.660
 but you 're ready this is going to fly like 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.660
 burst 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.930
 like that and it gets caught in the middle like this 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:13.080
 good friends from youtube this has been 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:15.630
 everything that you liked already know 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:20.359
 you can do this in your homes 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:20.359
 one only sheets of paper goodbye
