 Everything you can see is a completely new model 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:43.440
 What does bmw x5 look like in a tough-looking job? 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.910
 Dirt road section is Knife dream to be packed in the first x5 1999 Dun Harness quilted 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:50.699

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.930
 Placing in the urine w x5 compared sav time instead of the word suv 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:57.900
 He said. 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:01:01.800
 Sports utility light activity instead of seawater uv , which is the abbreviation of pickle pick 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:07.290
 I wrote it as sav. 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:12.120
 In writing the word activity instead of in the middle of a four-wheel drive utility 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:16.770
 Activity attract more oil, it's hers emphasized the active 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:21.120
 As a proof of this name, the four-wheel drive car at that time , 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:24.840
 I ran over 200km and ended up riding it brilliantly. 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:30.360

 It touches 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:46.510
 Oh, it's just like that. It's just that it's just running and it's a little messy. 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:53.650
 You should look at your sword. 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:58.390
 I changed my mind this time and it made me look good. 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:02:00.640
 Bmw's unique Kidney But it's getting bigger and headlamps stretching to the left and right 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:06.850
 It has been flattened to the left and right.

 Juana is a pain. 

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:21.919
 Of course I can change the color. 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:28.160
 But bmw's advantage is that it comes out when it's sold all the time. 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:29.210
