think I think maybe we'll just throw in
some<00:02:58.760> more<00:02:58.880> strawberries<00:02:59.090> after<00:02:59.810> for<00:03:00.410> extra

durian flavor I thought it'd be more
strawberryish<00:03:42.599> unless<00:03:43.599> durian<00:03:44.049> but<00:03:44.260> you

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
strawberryish unless durian but you

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.050
