00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.000
 hi friends hi friends then 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.620
 I say so short size today it 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.160
 weather is nice we want to make a 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.349
 barbecue 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.300
 but no luck we did not have any 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.540
 barbecue fire lady so we go when 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.470
 even make the whole chicken recipe 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.390
 grilled with lemongrass ensure the 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.939
 lemongrass but we're going to bake it 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.500
 baked ways so it'll be more fun 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.990
 which is a little windy risk 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.840
 to have the firefighter helicopter that 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.010
 will swing us some water so we're going to 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.960
 to make the oven stops simpler because 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.380
 that there is a little wind it's good you have 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.390
 finished your switch bah yes yes me you want 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.630

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.860
 go 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.860
 here we go 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.450
 that's it for this chicken recipe 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.780
 grilled with lemongrass 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:01:00.809
 we will need the basic sauces 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:06.860
 in this basic recipe soy sauce 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:13.920
 clear soy sauce black fish sauce 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:18.630

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:25.860

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:35.630
 in the mixer too but here we do it at 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.630

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:44.119

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.119
 there are three branches 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:02:01.260
 the seeds of black pepper we crush 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:04.850
 all right you have to have 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:21.600
 got a nice little paw 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:25.770
 so put it all in the salad bowl on 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:32.880
 add the equivalent of 2 spoonfuls 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:33.300

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:22.780
 a small marinade 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:28.060
 we just have to cut the chicken 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:28.060

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:37.540
 the crashes well we make all the bones fart 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.540

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:48.160
 alas when it is well flattened 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:53.050
 although enough in the marinade 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:04:02.830
