00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:10.760
 hello in this video I would like to 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:12.440
 let me show you how I do it 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.840
 I did with the unlock and that 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.580
 I would like to show you now we go 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.930
 Now just assume that then 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.849
 I have already prepared completely 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.080
 is 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:22.600
 Of course, that's what the 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.630
 Exercise did not do 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:29.090
 and yes, if someone is interested in it 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.609
 that I make a video like me 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.410
 use the hand and as well as I do 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:35.239
 the tips stickers and something and such 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:39.379
 more could me happy in the 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:40.850
 Write comments and as we said 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:43.250
 assume that the natural 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.030
 Prepared is knowledgeable 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.309
 trees 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.019
 well who removed today and so on and so on 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.269
 so on words already done and 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:53.330
 then it goes on with the make-up go on 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:54.860
 that's a bit darker now 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.290
 actually only very beautiful woman i can 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.510
 you unfortunately and I say where is because 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.140
 really nothing stands on it and 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.140
 more 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:08.119
 in such a way that I myself have a 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:13.460
 take up quite a lot 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:16.909
 I basically only buy many 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:19.460
 So you make up genes and build genes 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.990
 the discourse is meaningful because it makes me easy 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.060
 better to be able to do it but everyone has to 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.280
 I'll take care of that for myself 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:29.420
 really a thicker one here 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:42.020
 give up and calm down 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:43.490
 little bit, and a bit thicker 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:48.219
 As I said a bit more 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:52.130
 take and put this off about here 

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:53.659
 and then move it backwards 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.909
 It should not be so thick with it 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.799
 that does not look so unnatural and 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:01.579
 so that does not grow out of the fog 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:03.969
 so striking if you want you can 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:09.500
 so that then already easy construction 

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:12.850
 modeling and most beautiful sides though 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.850
 Please do not touch the cuticle 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:22.090
 and then you can too 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.090
 already the negative smile a form before 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:33.860
 my my line is not quite like that 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:37.840
 but it could be dramatic 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.840
 then vary as he likes it 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:28.840
 that's what it looks like now and me 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.810
 I'll fix that up a bit 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:35.110
 then you want the brush 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:38.110
 clean it once and could do it again 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:41.190
 with the clean brush on the main 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.190
 go along 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.930
 we have one more time this time 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.890
 to make it more beautiful 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:52.000
 but as I said it does not have to be that way 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:54.880
 be perfect because I always do it that way 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.590
 that I endure taking this time 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.230
 then orders but I show that 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:13.330
 then you can then the first 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:16.540
 lamp to endure if you like that then 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:20.640
 then you can do the navi with 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:25.030
 no break dry to letter and 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:28.300
 then you take a celebration best 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.950
 the rough side of the cure and then 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.930
 you also do not need to defuse 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:35.290
 because those sharp edges need them 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:37.870
 We also have to file this time 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:41.530
 So as I said the rough side of the 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:44.440
 pillar and then hope that now 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:48.040
 know so far and then I go here 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.390
 down in the main and makes 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.040
 line still a bit 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:52.750
 I think that's a very good one 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.580
 variant if you own the nails 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.260
 or maybe you want to 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.570
 not such a quiet hand 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.960
 and this is how the week actually works 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.960
 very well 

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:31.490
 so if you did that and you 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:35.250
 be reasonably satisfied with it 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:40.289
 that's me, you can actually 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:45.150
 removed new dust and goes 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:46.669
 again with a dry tent over it 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.569
 then we can already with the 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:50.639
 franchise continues tomorrow 

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:53.009
 I have it here from german dream 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:55.080
 nails before I'm actually quite 

00:05:53.009 --> 00:06:00.479
 beautiful is definitely something different 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:07.469
 so hot and yes that's how it looks 

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:08.969
 such a gold orange something on everyone 

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:13.969
 case technically I was in danger 

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:15.810
 rarely seen anywhere 

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:18.090
 and yes I'm taking now a 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:19.830
 Soil is something on the paint would be 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:23.159
 I do not recommend taking too much 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:26.599
 because the lok is he is very fluid and 

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:34.860
 yes, it's definitely going away fast 

00:06:26.599 --> 00:06:38.599
 so i put this on the front and can 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:39.779
 that really wonderful here on the edge 

00:06:38.599 --> 00:06:42.120
 fix 

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:43.620
 So that works really well 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.310
 I think it's really a simple one 

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:48.569
 method 

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:51.000
 just for beginners or for the 

00:06:48.569 --> 00:06:53.719
 really not the most quiet 

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.719
 have a hand 

00:07:13.129 --> 00:07:18.590
 Make sure you are here 

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:18.590
 beautiful in the corners goes in 

00:07:53.570 --> 00:08:02.060
 that's what it looks like now and yes 

00:07:58.289 --> 00:08:02.060
 then the hand can go back to the lamp
