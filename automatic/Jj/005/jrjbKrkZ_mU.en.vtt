another<00:02:49.800> nice<00:02:50.250> feature<00:02:50.450> I'd<00:02:51.450> like<00:02:51.660> to<00:02:51.690> mention

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
another nice feature I'd like to mention

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.790 
another nice feature I'd like to mention
is<00:02:52.520> that<00:02:53.520> the<00:02:54.480> red<00:02:54.720> stop<00:02:54.990> can<00:02:55.230> remove<00:02:55.500> to<00:02:55.680> the

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
is that the red stop can remove to the

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.250 
is that the red stop can remove to the
end<00:02:55.980> or<00:02:56.460> anywhere<00:02:56.790> you<00:02:56.940> want<00:02:57.180> it<00:02:57.330> and<00:02:57.510> it<00:02:58.110> can

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
end or anywhere you want it and it can

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.830 
end or anywhere you want it and it can
actually<00:02:58.740> act<00:02:58.950> as<00:02:59.130> a<00:02:59.190> safety<00:02:59.550> so<00:03:00.390> the<00:03:00.510> operator

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
actually act as a safety so the operator
