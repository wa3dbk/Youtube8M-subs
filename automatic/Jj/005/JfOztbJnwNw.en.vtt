00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.800
 hello everyone welcome for a new 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.540
 episode of the monsters garage then 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.610
 today we are in norges the 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.019
 city cold and cost then you go to me 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.400
 to say it's not necessarily the right place 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:18.980
 but we will test a vehicle 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.760
 typically Californian then haider 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.760
 Let's go 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.739
 I have the rolls we like the car of 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.149
 father in son dad sculptor and 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.010
 passionate about old americans has 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:45.949
 transmitted the virus of modification to 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.840
 his son as early as the 90s novel and 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:49.820
 prototypist he designs restores and 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.710
 transforms all types of vehicles formed 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.480
 at the school of preparation at mtk the 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.870
 young Burgundy decided to launch his 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.870
 own business 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.379
 his company in your eyes is raising the 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:01.820
 wildest challenges to demonstrate his 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:03.290
 know-how the young man decided to 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:07.900
 tackle an original discipline 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.900
 even totally exotic the low rider 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:12.380
 the fifties baffles at the mills 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.020
 to differentiate themselves from whites who had 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.210
 muscle cars and them for themselves 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.979
 differentiate from this movement there and he 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.259
 had cars that were really 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.450
 only what to ride like this and 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:23.869
 paraded in the streets to 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.300
 to see 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.310
 So here are the rims the hydraulics 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.640
 here are the feet at the level of paintings 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.890
 flashy like this it's really 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:52.220
 Main criteria like lady or 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:54.159
 what for this project is to lead 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.900
 his choice towards a corvair chevrolet 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.580
 this compact launched in the 60s 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.409
 to compete with the ladybug on the 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.970
 us market was one of the first to 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.039
 receive a six- cylinder flat in 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.240
 rear overhang a specialty 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:07.220
 mastered by porsche 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.800
 a little less by chevrolet which has 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.060
 made his conduct more than precarious 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.519
 dangerous at all speeds had it 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.400
 nicknamed the Americans so I took 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:18.110
 this base a bit by chance at the beginning 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.550
 after I realized in twenty members 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.680
 teachers that there were none 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.630
 was made to the world in low version 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.780
 so that made me even more motivated to 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:29.510
 do something safe that basis 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.890
 there what the story starts in 2005 novel 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.050
 recovers the American in a sorry state 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.239
 sandblasting of the crate reinforcement of the 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.070
 chassis set up suicide doors 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.070
 to say that the challenge is raised but 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.239
 the Burgundy is obstinate and above all 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.100
 perfectionist in the image of this 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:44.030
 interior totally renovated with the 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.410
 codes of the time 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.360
 Roman surrounded himself with the best in 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.810
 every area like upholstery and the 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.850
 painting 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.680
 but the particularity of a low rider 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.810
 it's his ability to vary his 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.670
 suspensions two pumps arranged on 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.560
 each axle is responsible for animating these 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.380
 last of all all the figures are 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.000
 allowed pancake hopping free wheels these 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.250
 cars can make vouchers 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.959
 more than five feet 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:11.989
 so this is a freebox bbox that serves to 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:14.000
 control the vehicle by raising this or 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:17.570
 such cylinders to move the car 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.820
 actually agree so that's connected to what 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.769
 so that's connected to the batteries yeah 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.890
 so me on my vehicle I have two 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:24.360
 pumps with 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.340
 three batteries so I turned in 36 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.080
 original volts or tournai in 12 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.670
 volts let's say for the system so at 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.959
 a pump on each subject for the front 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:35.940
 it counts for the front a pump for the 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:39.750
 rule so that's it trial star we are 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:41.550
 okay it's useless but so 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:45.180
 here you just master both studies 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:46.410
 to douala on the left here it is that and 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.780
 there beats that's how much 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.780
 basically we are at 20 cm on the back 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.660
 after that is the characteristics of the 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.310
 car I am neither it helps me not helped 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.440
 by her brother that she does not like there by 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.000
 example or a buick riviera or other 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.709
 of cars that are also taken for 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.480
 their ideas agree despite this look 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.100
 demonstrative the corvair did not undergo any 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.989
 big technical changes 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.180
 the six-cylinder flat of 140 horses has 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:10.650
 been totally rehabilitated it is 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.600
 now cooled by aeration 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.100
 specific that unfolds once the 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.269
 engine running suspensions 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.130
 hydraulic systems are not really 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:18.720
 suitable for driving on the road but 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.290
 novel kindly agreed to us 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:25.260
 take for a stroll 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:26.790
 it's really a pleasure car and 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.170
 this is really for crisis and what 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:31.890
 this case 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:34.110
 look broken so here we hang at 30 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:35.910
 40 km had so yes bend to the 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.640
 door there good there we do not have the sun 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:40.800
 from california may but hey that's it 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:44.460
 it's really done for his parries 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:46.170
 and yeah when it's a big budget 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:50.520
 like that but there you have not started 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:52.160
 the annals ans and barley is one of the 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.500
 twelve classes from several missions 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:58.220
 pascale manon otherwise it's going to put it to the 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.800
 soil what directly 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.290
 one dies but good is 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.400
 yeah that's going to be boring way 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:05.990
 three thousand six hundred hours of work 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.280
 in investment of the order of one hundred 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.350
 thousand euros of sweat and tears 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.920
 for a result at the height of his 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.290
 ambitions 

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.700
 seven bodies towards new wild is even 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:16.840
 imposed during a competition in Sweden 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:19.010
 in front of more than 1200 participants 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.500
 after it's really my showcase car 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:23.720
 to present what I know how to do and 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.330
 here at the foot before everything also make me 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:29.750
 pleasure and go to the demonstrations 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:32.470
 of this kind of vehicle what to put 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.470
 the slap to everyone
