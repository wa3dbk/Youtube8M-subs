00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
the end of my brow or the tail and I'm

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.719 
the end of my brow or the tail and I'm
lifting<00:01:58.170> up<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.890> hairs<00:01:59.159> now<00:01:59.460> that<00:01:59.640> I'm

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
lifting up the hairs now that I'm

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.190 
lifting up the hairs now that I'm
completely<00:02:00.180> finished<00:02:00.540> with<00:02:00.689> applying<00:02:01.020> the

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
completely finished with applying the

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.959 
completely finished with applying the
powder<00:02:01.409> I've<00:02:01.710> changed<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.369> shape<00:02:02.610> of<00:02:02.790> the

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
powder I've changed the shape of the

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.880 
powder I've changed the shape of the
brows<00:02:03.180> now<00:02:03.840> I'm<00:02:03.930> going<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.259> take<00:02:04.469> a<00:02:04.500> little

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
brows now I'm going to take a little

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.940 
brows now I'm going to take a little
eyebrow<00:02:05.670> pencil<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:06.780> I'm<00:02:07.200> just<00:02:07.380> going<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.680> use

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
eyebrow pencil and I'm just going to use

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.089 
eyebrow pencil and I'm just going to use
this<00:02:08.250> to<00:02:09.140> deepen<00:02:10.140> it<00:02:10.229> up<00:02:10.349> a<00:02:10.440> little<00:02:10.619> bit<00:02:10.860> and

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
this to deepen it up a little bit and

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.610 
this to deepen it up a little bit and
I'm<00:02:11.370> trying<00:02:11.670> to<00:02:11.849> mimic<00:02:12.060> the

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
I'm trying to mimic the

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.670 
I'm trying to mimic the
of<00:02:12.860> hairs<00:02:13.159> within<00:02:13.489> the<00:02:13.700> brow<00:02:13.989> add<00:02:14.989> some<00:02:15.530> more

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
of hairs within the brow add some more

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.570 
of hairs within the brow add some more
texture<00:02:16.250> and<00:02:17.230> again<00:02:18.230> I'm<00:02:18.500> using<00:02:18.709> very<00:02:19.159> short

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
texture and again I'm using very short

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.300 
texture and again I'm using very short
strokes<00:02:20.150> and<00:02:20.450> going<00:02:20.840> with<00:02:21.140> the<00:02:21.319> grain<00:02:21.560> of<00:02:21.830> hair

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
strokes and going with the grain of hair

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.610 
strokes and going with the grain of hair
so<00:02:23.060> now<00:02:23.180> a<00:02:23.209> bit<00:02:23.390> more<00:02:23.420> texture<00:02:23.989> has<00:02:24.170> been<00:02:24.349> added

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
so now a bit more texture has been added

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.830 
so now a bit more texture has been added
to<00:02:24.650> the<00:02:24.860> brows<00:02:25.099> and<00:02:25.640> using<00:02:26.030> a<00:02:26.090> brow<00:02:26.299> gel<00:02:26.330> I'm

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
to the brows and using a brow gel I'm

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.289 
to the brows and using a brow gel I'm
going<00:02:27.140> to<00:02:27.319> set<00:02:27.620> them<00:02:27.860> now<00:02:28.190> the<00:02:28.250> idea<00:02:28.730> here<00:02:29.150> I'm

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:29.299 
going to set them now the idea here I'm

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:32.020 
going to set them now the idea here I'm
actually<00:02:29.480> going<00:02:29.810> to<00:02:29.930> use<00:02:30.049> upward<00:02:30.590> strokes<00:02:31.030> so

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
actually going to use upward strokes so

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.470 
actually going to use upward strokes so
that<00:02:32.209> the<00:02:32.329> hairs<00:02:32.629> sort<00:02:33.049> of<00:02:33.140> peek<00:02:33.530> out<00:02:33.799> above

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
that the hairs sort of peek out above

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.380 
that the hairs sort of peek out above
the<00:02:35.480> perimeter<00:02:36.349> of<00:02:36.500> what<00:02:36.709> I've<00:02:36.829> just<00:02:36.860> drawn<00:02:37.340> on

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
the perimeter of what I've just drawn on

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.149 
the perimeter of what I've just drawn on
this<00:02:38.390> is<00:02:38.540> going<00:02:38.810> to<00:02:38.959> make<00:02:39.110> it<00:02:39.560> look<00:02:39.829> a<00:02:39.950> bit<00:02:39.980> more

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:40.159 
this is going to make it look a bit more

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:42.729 
this is going to make it look a bit more
natural<00:02:40.790> that<00:02:40.970> you<00:02:41.810> can<00:02:41.930> actually<00:02:42.079> see<00:02:42.590> the

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
natural that you can actually see the

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:45.910 
natural that you can actually see the
hairs<00:02:43.010> makes<00:02:43.970> the<00:02:44.209> hairs<00:02:44.510> more<00:02:44.959> defined<00:02:45.379> but

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
hairs makes the hairs more defined but

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.080 
hairs makes the hairs more defined but
also<00:02:46.069> keeps<00:02:46.609> them<00:02:46.879> in<00:02:47.030> place<00:02:48.700> now<00:02:49.700> I<00:02:49.730> really

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
also keeps them in place now I really

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.550 
also keeps them in place now I really
feel<00:02:50.269> like<00:02:50.299> I've<00:02:50.569> got<00:02:50.690> the<00:02:50.810> foundations<00:02:51.470> for

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
feel like I've got the foundations for

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.890 
feel like I've got the foundations for
my<00:02:51.769> makeup<00:02:52.129> actually<00:02:52.310> there<00:02:52.910> now<00:02:53.480> I<00:02:53.510> can<00:02:53.750> move

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900

I'm<00:02:55.700> going<00:02:55.940> to<00:02:56.090> prime<00:02:56.359> the<00:02:56.569> eyelids<00:02:56.989> this

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
I'm going to prime the eyelids this

across<00:05:09.320> the<00:05:09.710> apples<00:05:10.370> of<00:05:10.520> my<00:05:10.550> cheeks<00:05:11.170> to<00:05:12.170> give<00:05:12.350> a

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.380

across the apples of my cheeks to give a
natural<00:05:12.890> flush<00:05:13.100> I<00:05:14.170> chose<00:05:15.170> this<00:05:15.350> color<00:05:15.590> because
