so today I'm going to teach you how to
go<00:00:06.899> back<00:00:07.080> to<00:00:07.460> first

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
go back to first

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.810 
go back to first
once<00:00:09.450> you<00:00:09.599> understand<00:00:09.990> some<00:00:10.500> things<00:00:10.740> that<00:00:11.700> you

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
once you understand some things that you

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.490 
once you understand some things that you
might<00:00:11.910> need<00:00:12.030> to<00:00:12.150> know<00:00:12.179> before<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:13.200> biggest

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
might need to know before the biggest

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.959 
might need to know before the biggest
problem<00:00:13.860> we're<00:00:14.009> doing<00:00:14.219> back<00:00:14.400> flips<00:00:14.549> is<00:00:14.790> that

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
problem we're doing back flips is that

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.269 
problem we're doing back flips is that
people<00:00:15.870> have<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.199> fear<00:00:16.619> that<00:00:16.800> they<00:00:17.070> have<00:00:17.190> to

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
people have the fear that they have to

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.720 
people have the fear that they have to
overcome<00:00:17.600> first<00:00:18.600> so<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:20.160> best<00:00:20.340> way<00:00:20.550> I<00:00:20.580> can

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
overcome first so the best way I can

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.750 
overcome first so the best way I can
explain<00:00:20.910> it<00:00:21.330> is<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:22.140> worst<00:00:22.949> case<00:00:23.220> scenario

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
explain it is the worst case scenario

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:30.439 
explain it is the worst case scenario
you<00:00:24.180> die<00:00:26.810> worst<00:00:27.810> case<00:00:27.990> scenario<00:00:28.050> so<00:00:29.449> besides

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
you die worst case scenario so besides

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.870 
you die worst case scenario so besides
the<00:00:30.720> worst<00:00:30.900> case<00:00:31.109> scenario<00:00:31.650> all<00:00:32.250> I<00:00:32.309> have<00:00:32.730> to

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
the worst case scenario all I have to

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.030 
the worst case scenario all I have to
say<00:00:32.910> is<00:00:33.239> what<00:00:33.809> you<00:00:33.960> want<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.200> do<00:00:34.320> is<00:00:34.590> is<00:00:34.860> you

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
say is what you want to do is is you

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.500 
say is what you want to do is is you
want<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.280> make<00:00:35.399> sure<00:00:35.640> that<00:00:35.760> you<00:00:35.910> can<00:00:36.059> jump<00:00:36.300> high

enough<00:00:36.540> in<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.079> air<00:00:37.230> that's<00:00:38.040> probably<00:00:38.489> the

enough in the air that's probably the

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.340 
enough in the air that's probably the
number<00:00:38.879> one<00:00:39.030> key<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.629> doing<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:39.930> back<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.230> be

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
number one key and doing the back to be

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.410 
number one key and doing the back to be
getting<00:00:40.649> up<00:00:40.860> into<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.489> air<00:00:41.730> as<00:00:41.940> high<00:00:42.149> as<00:00:42.210> you

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
getting up into the air as high as you

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.510 
getting up into the air as high as you
possibly<00:00:42.840> can<00:00:43.050> so<00:00:43.710> that<00:00:43.739> you<00:00:44.219> don't

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
possibly can so that you don't

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.150 
possibly can so that you don't
potentially<00:00:45.059> fall<00:00:45.300> on<00:00:45.420> HSN<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:46.590> see<00:00:46.649> people

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
backflips and they do pawn ahead that's

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:52.880 
backflips and they do pawn ahead that's
because<00:00:52.140> they<00:00:52.199> didn't<00:00:52.440> really<00:00:52.559> give<00:00:52.739> it<00:00:52.829> the

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
because they didn't really give it the

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
get as much power into it as you

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.400 
get as much power into it as you

want to jump in the air and at the top
of<00:02:13.970> you<00:02:14.150> jump<00:02:14.330> you<00:02:14.420> want<00:02:14.600> to<00:02:14.660> toss<00:02:14.870> okay<00:02:15.260> I

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
up in the air like this is a backflip

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.710 
up in the air like this is a backflip
okay<00:02:34.640> this<00:02:34.820> is<00:02:34.940> something<00:02:35.120> that<00:02:35.300> you<00:02:35.450> want<00:02:35.660> to

the fear of going backwards there's

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.910 
the fear of going backwards there's
something<00:02:49.790> idea<00:02:50.150> when<00:02:50.300> I<00:02:50.360> was<00:02:50.390> younger<00:02:50.690> I<00:02:51.020> had

a thing income we're con mcconkle so

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.770 
a thing income we're con mcconkle so
ikkaku<00:03:00.650> looks<00:03:01.190> like<00:03:01.340> this<00:03:03.310> okay<00:03:04.310> so<00:03:05.000> to<00:03:05.630> get

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
ikkaku looks like this okay so to get

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.030 
ikkaku looks like this okay so to get
yourself<00:03:06.110> more<00:03:06.380> comfortable<00:03:06.769> with<00:03:06.890> going

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
yourself more comfortable with going

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.830 
yourself more comfortable with going
backwards<00:03:07.489> you<00:03:07.970> can<00:03:08.120> start<00:03:08.299> off<00:03:08.450> on<00:03:08.750> the

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
backwards you can start off on the

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.240 
backwards you can start off on the
ground<00:03:09.049> you<00:03:09.590> might<00:03:09.739> even<00:03:09.860> want<00:03:10.040> to<00:03:10.070> side

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
ground you might even want to side

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.560 
ground you might even want to side
outside<00:03:10.400> like<00:03:10.820> this<00:03:11.000> is<00:03:11.120> not<00:03:11.299> really

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
outside like this is not really

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.150 
outside like this is not really
necessary<00:03:12.080> what<00:03:12.260> you<00:03:12.380> want<00:03:12.620> to<00:03:12.709> do<00:03:12.830> when<00:03:13.070> you

necessary what you want to do when you
do<00:03:13.280> a<00:03:13.310> backflip<00:03:13.730> but<00:03:13.940> to<00:03:14.570> get<00:03:14.720> yourself

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
do a backflip but to get yourself

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.870 
do a backflip but to get yourself
comfortable<00:03:15.350> with<00:03:15.650> onto<00:03:15.920> this<00:03:15.980> side<00:03:16.250> so<00:03:16.640> going

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
comfortable with onto this side so going

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.050 
comfortable with onto this side so going
backwards<00:03:17.450> you<00:03:18.019> can<00:03:18.260> do<00:03:18.440> this<00:03:18.590> you<00:03:18.739> can<00:03:19.060> come

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
backwards you can do this you can come

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.960 
backwards you can do this you can come
to<00:03:20.239> the<00:03:20.360> side<00:03:20.650> first<00:03:21.650> okay<00:03:21.980> one<00:03:22.580> of<00:03:22.610> the<00:03:22.820> way<00:03:22.940> I

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
to the side first okay one of the way I

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:23.350 
to the side first okay one of the way I
teach

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
teach

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.990

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
ikkaku if you want to start it you can

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.190 
ikkaku if you want to start it you can
you<00:03:26.600> know<00:03:26.690> come<00:03:27.440> over<00:03:27.590> yourself<00:03:28.160> you<00:03:28.370> know

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
you know come over yourself you know

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.530 
you know come over yourself you know
you're<00:03:30.200> both<00:03:30.320> arms

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540

point where you want to get the jump in

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:42.240 
point where you want to get the jump in
it<00:03:40.450> -<00:03:40.540> okay<00:03:40.719> you<00:03:41.290> can't<00:03:41.500> do<00:03:41.590> a<00:03:41.620> back<00:03:41.799> handspring
