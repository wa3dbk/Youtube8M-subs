00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.259
 youtube will not be available for 6 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.450
 as you can see here I have 36 I do not have 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.730
 youtube that I had to download this 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.290
 apply good morning to the subscribers of 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.289
 youtube today we are going to make you 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.940
 the review of the youtube application and 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.880
 mainly I know that many are 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.470
 asking about my humble opinion 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.680
 we go as the logo and start with the 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.680
 video 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:33.120
 ok guys we have the new update 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.610
 from youtube for both ios and for android 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.720
 for android and for the heroes is the 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.730
 version 2.0 and for android is the version 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.890
 5.0 and what's new in this version is that 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.900
 as you can see it has a flat design 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.660
 that's what you see that already has a 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:51.150
 design that comes together or greater 7 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.879
 and if we enter is where we can see that 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.129
 here does not have much difference in truth 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.960
 to what we used to see but what 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.080
 interesting about this application and what 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.820
 has everyone in the head is this 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.370
 part of here we're going to see I'm going to a 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.620
 my video of course I'm going to give to 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.090
 play good my side of mine no but look 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.820
 what I can do is to 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.740
 minimize explain how to use it well 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.350
 well that was good there can come 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.140
 here and download the video and there I can see 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.360
 the video there are months explaining you 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.040
 they saw the one who tells me that if I slipped 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.470
 to the left and I can close the 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.600
 video and I can do well to put it 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.490
 in big 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:34.079
 excellent that has everyone crazy 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:36.390
 it's something we saw in a tweet but it's 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.420
 very interesting that we see that youtube 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.719
 does this and in the same way it works 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.990
 in the same stage they come to that I can 

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:47.729
 come here and in the same way that 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.700
 we can do in the aigÃ¼es system 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.920
 we can download and navigate now what is not 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.829
 I like it but I want to make this clear 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.810
 he really liked that we are moving forward 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.670
 doing the new things are they are 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.929
 implementing new ideas because I 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.970
 I did a review of the application of 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:05.159
 youtube last year when it came out 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.860
 first time for ios 6 for the first time 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.049
 the youtube version does not make the 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.079
 dome version that did google not the 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:15.599
 or up version was the one I 

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:17.280
 I did not like the support and when it came 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.709
 the google I expected much more 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.099
 as it is in this version I wait for me 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:25.079
 much more and what this does is what 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:27.000
 we keep seeing is the same thing in question 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:29.160
 of comments that's why I am 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.230
 using jasmine for this kind of videos 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.440
 notice that here 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.409
 How do I like to respond to the 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.420
 comments specifically that's not what 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:41.610
 I can do and that's something that I still 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.890
 annoying of this application and how to 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.900
 I said that is fantastic but you 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.299
 they know that I can do this and what 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.620
 have jerry look at that other problem 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:51.080
 also from this application that since 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.860
 I leave I can not continue 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.299
 reproducing but look what I 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.940
 I can do what I can do too 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:58.560
 in android is that I am in yazmin 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.379
 true and I'm going to hit a video 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.090
 and look what I do a magic trick 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:04.410
 but this is only so that it has 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.010
 snow and that's why I always give them 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.819
 I say guys the jailbreak is very advanced 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.950
 okay 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:14.620
 look what I do ready 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.019
 There they saw that hill and there follows the 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.510
 video playing and it was even more 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:21.849
 simple that in youtube things that 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.200
 we can also configure you to notice that 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:25.000
 I can also something that we can not 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.879
 do in the youtube application is 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.950
 move the video to any part of the 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:33.220
 operating system but pause the video 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:35.950
 I can put it in Abu Dhabi I can go back 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.390
 to put it big to eliminate it 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.360
 we have to give to this cross and if it is of 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:43.090
 up here then that's what I 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.530
 I say like it's fantastic I understand 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.450
 the pressure of the community because no 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.130
 everybody has airbag not all the 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.510
 world can have video paint i made a 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.799
 video about the video I thought I 'll leave 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.450
 here below in case you want 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:54.340
 see it also let's prove it as 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.750
 I can do it on android android 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.420
 this is done with an application that 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.099
 call youtube flow ping look i come 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.660
 up here after we have that 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:03.880
 installed application of course we're going 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.650
 to give it up here where cotton 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.650
 share you know what they have 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.569
 Android the community we are going to look for the 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.849
 clear application look here as you 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:14.500
 flame florida youtube player although it is 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:16.180
 an application that can be downloaded in 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.250
 the google play we give you and 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.980
 we will automatically be able to 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:24.040
 the video where we want to move the 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:26.290
 application is even better than youtube 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.940
 just like on the iphone of course but 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.860
 it's much better than youtube because 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.470
 now we can be in the system 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:36.190
 the application do not misunderstand me 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:38.170
 liked but still lacks a lot to 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.360
 overcome other things that we can already 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:42.130
 find out there on the iphone with the 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.870
 jailbreak and on the android without the 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.120
 need to serve only with one 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.580
 application so it's my review is in my 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.050
 I liked that they did the 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.320
 change I liked that you see that they are 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:56.080
 working on the application but you 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.790
 still missing a lot I still do not like the 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.500
 comment system that I can not 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:03.640
 respond to comments as to me 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:05.140
 like but nothing a good review and it's something 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:08.950
 that we already had in both systems 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:10.060
 operative guys ios and android tell me 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.890
 now what you think about me 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.780
 comment on my opinion about what 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.830
 I told them if you understand me if 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.390
 you do not understand me if you 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.640
 they think that I am following a lot 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:21.280
 youtube look at my thing I wanted youtube to me 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:23.830
 I love youtube ok but I am a 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.210
 undemanding when I like something I know 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.759
 I say them and when something does not 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:29.169
 I also said this has been all for 

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:31.060
 this video I hope he is alive 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:34.080
 have liked to nito from above more no longer 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.080
 it will be section 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:39.490
 boy I forgot to show you how it looks 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:42.669
 on the ipad let's see how it looks 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:44.469
 He also opens a video of my friend 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:46.689
 luanco let's see if we can do it 

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:49.840
 we will also see if it works the same 

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:52.509
 works the same size and size with 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.360
 a little too small to make the screen 

00:05:52.509 --> 00:05:56.800
 great that we have on the ipad but 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.810
 it works the same way I would like that 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.389
 be a little bigger and it's the same 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:03.400
 I tell you, it 's a little frustrating that 

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:06.520
 we can not move it up and we can 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.479
 use it outside of the operating system and 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.710
 I hope you liked this video 

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:10.710
 Now if I leave, say goodbye
