00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
the playstation for a slim this is the

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.330 
the playstation for a slim this is the
120<00:00:06.089> year<00:00:06.299> by<00:00:06.480> model<00:00:06.810> now<00:00:07.740> first<00:00:07.980> of<00:00:08.069> all<00:00:08.130> let's

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
120 year by model now first of all let's

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.770 
120 year by model now first of all let's
just<00:00:08.580> go<00:00:08.730> through<00:00:08.760> the<00:00:09.150> hardware<00:00:09.570> of<00:00:09.690> the

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
just go through the hardware of the

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.249 
just go through the hardware of the
system<00:00:10.290> obviously<00:00:11.040> we<00:00:12.000> have<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.540> blu-ray

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
system obviously we have the blu-ray

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:14.900 
system obviously we have the blu-ray
drive<00:00:13.559> on<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:13.950> front<00:00:14.190> and<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:14.490> two<00:00:14.639> physical

drive on the front and the two physical
touch<00:00:15.179> buttons<00:00:15.630> rather<00:00:16.410> than<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.740> touchpad

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
touch buttons rather than the touchpad

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.900 
touch buttons rather than the touchpad

obviously all instruction manuals needed
for<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.239> system<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:01.039> a<00:01:02.039> nice<00:01:02.219> little

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
for the system and a nice little

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.399 
for the system and a nice little
protective<00:01:03.120> cloth<00:01:03.420> for<00:01:04.110> when<00:01:04.260> you're

protective cloth for when you're
carrying<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:04.799> about<00:01:05.070> when<00:01:05.250> you're<00:01:05.369> moving<00:01:05.460> it

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
carrying it about when you're moving it

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.630 
carrying it about when you're moving it
around<00:01:05.990> you<00:01:06.990> also<00:01:07.409> get<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.040> DualShock<00:01:08.610> 3

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
around you also get to the DualShock 3

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.690 
around you also get to the DualShock 3
controller<00:01:09.320> power<00:01:10.320> cables<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.460> USB

controller power cables and the USB

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.960 
controller power cables and the USB
charger<00:01:13.189> now<00:01:14.189> if<00:01:14.280> you<00:01:14.400> do<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.520> little<00:01:14.640> bit<00:01:14.850> of

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
charger now if you do a little bit of

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.820 
charger now if you do a little bit of
comparison<00:01:15.330> between<00:01:15.659> these<00:01:16.080> slim<00:01:16.409> on<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.650> 6

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
comparison between these slim on the 6

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.679 
comparison between these slim on the 6
to<00:01:16.979> gear<00:01:17.159> by<00:01:17.310> unit<00:01:17.610> you<00:01:17.670> can<00:01:17.850> see<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.150> 60

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
to gear by unit you can see the 60

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.580 
to gear by unit you can see the 60
gigabytes<00:01:19.080> is<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.650> bit<00:01:19.860> taller<00:01:20.250> than<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.610> slim

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
gigabytes is a bit taller than a slim

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.719 
gigabytes is a bit taller than a slim
it's<00:01:22.590> also<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:22.950> bit<00:01:23.100> wider<00:01:24.590> but<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.740> slim<00:01:26.070> is<00:01:26.340> a

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
it's also a bit wider but the slim is a

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.010 
it's also a bit wider but the slim is a
bit<00:01:26.939> longer<00:01:27.210> than<00:01:27.900> this<00:01:28.140> exterior<00:01:28.500> white<00:01:30.020> now

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
bit longer than this exterior white now

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.539 
bit longer than this exterior white now
I've<00:01:31.079> compared<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.530> speeds<00:01:31.829> in<00:01:32.100> which<00:01:32.250> the

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
I've compared the speeds in which the

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.910 
I've compared the speeds in which the
two<00:01:33.000> systems<00:01:33.450> actually<00:01:33.960> boot<00:01:34.170> so<00:01:34.439> obviously<00:01:34.860> I

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
two systems actually boot so obviously I

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.469 
two systems actually boot so obviously I
can't<00:01:35.189> do<00:01:35.369> that<00:01:35.520> because<00:01:35.610> I<00:01:35.729> don't<00:01:35.759> have<00:01:36.240> two

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
can't do that because I don't have two

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.910 
can't do that because I don't have two
TVs<00:01:36.900> in<00:01:37.110> each<00:01:37.200> room<00:01:38.150> then<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.750> 60<00:01:40.500> gigabytes

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
TVs in each room then the 60 gigabytes

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.520 
TVs in each room then the 60 gigabytes
is<00:01:41.270> slightly<00:01:42.270> faster<00:01:42.570> stronger<00:01:42.780> top<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.439> it

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
is slightly faster stronger top and it

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.340 
is slightly faster stronger top and it
does<00:01:43.740> load<00:01:44.009> games<00:01:44.390> slightly<00:01:45.390> faster<00:01:45.840> on<00:01:46.049> boot

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
does load games slightly faster on boot

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.440 
does load games slightly faster on boot
up<00:01:46.530> is<00:01:46.740> about<00:01:47.960> 1.3<00:01:49.159> seconds<00:01:50.159> faster<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.090> on

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
up is about 1.3 seconds faster and on

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.929 
up is about 1.3 seconds faster and on
loading<00:01:52.170> games<00:01:52.560> about<00:01:53.060> 0.7<00:01:54.060> seconds<00:01:54.450> faster

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:55.939 
loading games about 0.7 seconds faster

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:58.399 
loading games about 0.7 seconds faster
so<00:01:56.939> yeah<00:01:57.119> there<00:01:57.329> is<00:01:57.450> not<00:01:57.930> much<00:01:58.259> of<00:01:58.350> a

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
so yeah there is not much of a

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.840 
so yeah there is not much of a
difference<00:01:58.530> when<00:01:58.920> it<00:01:59.009> comes<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.369> booting<00:01:59.700> up

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
difference when it comes to booting up

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.190 
difference when it comes to booting up
or<00:02:00.119> loading<00:02:00.780> games<00:02:02.689> now<00:02:03.689> other<00:02:03.930> than<00:02:03.960> that

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
or loading games now other than that

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.530 
or loading games now other than that
it's<00:02:04.290> very<00:02:04.439> minor<00:02:04.710> downsides<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.640> ps3<00:02:06.299> slim

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
it's very minor downsides the ps3 slim

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.229 
it's very minor downsides the ps3 slim
is<00:02:06.930> a<00:02:07.290> very<00:02:07.860> very<00:02:08.310> good<00:02:08.550> system<00:02:08.940> of<00:02:09.030> quite<00:02:09.209> a

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
is a very very good system of quite a

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.300 
is a very very good system of quite a
few<00:02:09.300> upsides<00:02:09.750> as<00:02:09.840> well<00:02:10.020> because<00:02:10.649> it<00:02:10.979> is

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
few upsides as well because it is

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.500 
few upsides as well because it is
lighter<00:02:11.790> than<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.540> fat<00:02:12.720> PS

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
lighter than the fat PS

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.349 
lighter than the fat PS
it's<00:02:14.349> it's<00:02:15.250> a<00:02:15.310> lot<00:02:15.459> more<00:02:15.579> portable<00:02:16.120> and<00:02:16.269> it

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:16.359 
it's it's a lot more portable and it

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:20.160 
it's it's a lot more portable and it
feels<00:02:16.659> just<00:02:16.780> as<00:02:17.319> durable<00:02:17.890> as<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.579> fat<00:02:18.849> ps3<00:02:19.390> it

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
feels just as durable as the fat ps3 it

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.229 
feels just as durable as the fat ps3 it
also<00:02:20.319> generates<00:02:20.829> a<00:02:20.920> lot<00:02:21.159> less<00:02:21.370> heat<00:02:21.670> which<00:02:22.030> is

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
also generates a lot less heat which is

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:25.170 
also generates a lot less heat which is
a<00:02:22.480> major<00:02:22.719> upside<00:02:23.290> for<00:02:23.439> me<00:02:23.500> and<00:02:23.829> it's<00:02:24.790> a<00:02:24.909> lot

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
a major upside for me and it's a lot

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.539 
a major upside for me and it's a lot
quieter<00:02:25.469> even<00:02:26.469> though<00:02:26.590> I<00:02:26.620> don't<00:02:26.739> use<00:02:27.129> the<00:02:27.310> slim

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549 
quieter even though I don't use the slim

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:31.080 
quieter even though I don't use the slim
model<00:02:27.790> because<00:02:28.030> it's<00:02:28.209> my<00:02:28.359> sister's<00:02:29.250> it<00:02:30.250> is<00:02:30.609> a

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
model because it's my sister's it is a

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.479 
model because it's my sister's it is a
lot<00:02:31.510> quieter<00:02:31.750> over<00:02:32.439> a<00:02:32.469> long<00:02:32.889> period<00:02:33.219> of<00:02:33.280> time

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
lot quieter over a long period of time

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.819 
lot quieter over a long period of time
like<00:02:33.549> this<00:02:34.239> thing<00:02:34.510> can<00:02:34.689> be<00:02:34.780> running<00:02:35.019> like<00:02:35.200> nine
