like<00:02:01.550> a<00:02:01.580> side<00:02:01.850> hop<00:02:02.090> just<00:02:02.330> like<00:02:02.510> going<00:02:03.290> on<00:02:03.380> the

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
like a side hop just like going on the

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.550 
like a side hop just like going on the
side<00:02:03.620> of<00:02:03.710> the<00:02:03.770> curve<00:02:03.950> and<00:02:04.190> going<00:02:04.400> like<00:02:04.550> that

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
side of the curve and going like that

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.360 
side of the curve and going like that
helps<00:02:06.560> a<00:02:06.710> little<00:02:06.830> bit

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.370
