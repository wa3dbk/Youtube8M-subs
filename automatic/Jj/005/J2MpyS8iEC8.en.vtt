big the file size can be so starting off
the<00:01:16.920> first<00:01:17.159> one<00:01:17.340> let's<00:01:17.640> go<00:01:17.820> ahead<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.030> change

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
the first one let's go ahead and change

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.310 
the first one let's go ahead and change
these<00:01:20.210> it's<00:01:21.210> pretty<00:01:21.390> close<00:01:21.600> I'm<00:01:21.869> just<00:01:22.110> change

these it's pretty close I'm just change
them<00:01:22.409> all<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.740> about<00:01:22.920> 200<00:01:23.659> that's<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:24.720> good<00:01:24.869> size

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
them all to about 200 that's a good size

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.179 
them all to about 200 that's a good size
usually<00:01:25.320> make<00:01:25.619> sure<00:01:25.740> your<00:01:25.830> constraint

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
properties to set that way it changes it

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.560 
properties to set that way it changes it
accordingly<00:01:29.460> whoops<00:01:30.060> I<00:01:30.150> just<00:01:30.180> change<00:01:30.479> the

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:03.170 
file size of lot when there's a lot of

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:04.300 
file size of lot when there's a lot of
pictures<00:06:03.380> has<00:06:03.680> to<00:06:03.770> change<00:06:03.980> through<00:06:04.190> because

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:04.310 
pictures has to change through because

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.340 
pictures has to change through because
it<00:06:04.400> has<00:06:04.520> a<00:06:04.550> store<00:06:04.850> all<00:06:05.000> that<00:06:05.030> information<00:06:05.840> in<00:06:06.260> a
