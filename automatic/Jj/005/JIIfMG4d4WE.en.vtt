00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:07.689
 well this video is answer to the 

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.689
 crisis with its barrier crisis 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:16.760
 to do a tutorial on the use of 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:22.070
 the modes of the major and minor k 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:23.869
 well, it also locates less has 71 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.710
 I do not usually think about the 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:29.750
 scales by their new separated not the 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.460
 I think separately there is usually 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:35.090
 situations in which they follow are the 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:37.309
 modes in the case of the melodic minor the 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.890
 option of situations in the 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:42.400
 improvisation if they talk about the progression 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.400
 at 21 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.100
 when I'm improvising in a 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.440
 minor tonality and I do not want to use the 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.260
 lower the natural minor scale or the 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.600
 scale a harmonica 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:57.050
 but then only one the scale 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:01.000
 minor my logic and the other situation in 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:04.269
 l'aquila is when I'm thinking 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.829
 improvising and not responding 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:13.179
 7 sustained 11 and use a new specific 

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:14.649
 of climbing to watch video 7 but 

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:17.439
 same as from the entire web structure 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:21.659
 will explain the way in which the 

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:21.659
 use the first grant a tonality 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.760
 so how do I think about how I think 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.670
 fast the 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:37.330
 how normal faces were built 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:39.400
 from the fundamental would be the 2 the 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:44.020
 fundamental the network of the ninth level 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:47.080
 for the third minor third flat to the 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.840
 fifth quarter fair are the fifth just 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.960
 by the to the sixth major if the seventh 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.590
 greater kido 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.840
 and the track with his life 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.380
 on the least logical scale from 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.659
 today as I think about it to locate my 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.760
 quick as you think that scale as the 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:09.530
 piece then I go with the 5th 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:17.110
 and I think as if it were a larger scale 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:17.110
 the only thing that is the third natural 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.100
 of the scale 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.580
 third 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.630
 and in the doubts 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:55.400
 true 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.400
 m 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.270
 do 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:08.280
 it is a special area then a context 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:10.620
 I do not have how to accompany me to progress to 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:14.900
 perverse kind by the accord and it's going to 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.900
 think more feeling 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.640
 two 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.690
 and 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.280
 d 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.250
 Y 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.740
 do not 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.250
 d 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:21.650
 on January 1 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.020
 and so 

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:18.009
 and 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:28.050
 as the first part the second form 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:33.570
 which I use is when I'm thinking 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:36.560
 in a chord 7 that is a chord in 7 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:39.810
 sustained 11 x replacement works 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:42.890
 tritÃ³n al then it will be editor 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:42.890
 it's already long to 0
