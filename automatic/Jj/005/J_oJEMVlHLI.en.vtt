00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.580
 how just do you have red lips at the 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.310
 color of your skin 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.689
 so you also wear a cool out color 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.640
 use your lips is with a little bit 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:26.529
 blue the ring and that you have a warm one 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.570
 use your skin color exactly with 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.759
 orange things these days are those 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.110
 rules have all become options and 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:34.780
 I always look at it very much 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:38.620
 best thing is with the person who is for you 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:42.070
 sit that is this time en masse with the cream 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:44.289
 nice mascha i'm going with a primary color 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.350
 fill in your lips and is primarily red 

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:48.999
 without blue orange 3 and then I go 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.539
 with a very classic color of that 

00:00:48.999 --> 00:00:53.679
 to hear 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:55.089
 3-pin when your lips start drawing look 

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:58.300
 then very good to your mouth 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:01:01.030
 because then you will notice that the one lip goes 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.100
 I hear what is and what is shorter and the 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.920
 others a little longer 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.050
 what ends more quickly and well 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.690
 look at your word and marshall like me 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.560
 so brutal at that can 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.110
 project office 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:17.620
 slightly lower they have the song 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.120
 narrow there is slightly wider and therefore 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.730
 such a lip pencil for because completely 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:25.150
 to equalize 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:27.790
 I start with the cupid bow and I sketch 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.800
 is not going to draw that line at once 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.380
 I sketch it and then this is it 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:35.680
 side of the cupid bow slightly lower 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.330
 just argue a little higher so me 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.410
 a nice tv 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.110
 if you don't know exactly where it is 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:43.540
 is not then you can possibly have one 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:47.400
 line here so that you exactly 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.400
 see what the middle is 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.050
 because we are not going to sketch at once 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.540
 draw this is a bit sultry 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.430
 so I 'm going to start it here from the 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:02.280
 corner of the mouth 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.280
 but I rounder him a little 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.220
 Well 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:13.520
 first line stands for this also just the 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.520
 line on 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:28.200
 hello the bottom have been looking good 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.859
 Slightly wider this in this little 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.180
 narrow 

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:32.180
 so I am going against this 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.020
 and on this side I go up 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.780
 Do you understand what I am saying? 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:58.050
 This is the basis of your lip line now 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.050
 we completely tighten it 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.810
 the he is distinguished here on yes and me 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.890
 you see but i'm going this way i'm going 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:11.980
 make some bulbs 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:14.140
 yes now i'm going to make the line tighter as 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.590
 I cross that line 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.590
 once again 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.280
 so you want your whole lipstick 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.580
 evening stays in place then you can 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:36.510
 of course with the lip pencil 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.510
 fill in the entire lip 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:43.350
 disadvantage is thus I have some 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.350
 dries out 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:53.160
 or just fill in the outside I leave 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:56.880
 I find it beautiful myself it is right in the middle 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.880
 to darken slightly 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.950
 now so 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:09.080
 look with young people 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.940
 very young girls of a year or 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.670
 thirteen fourteen 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.230
 if you look closely you are there 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:17.540
 in the middle it is a bit darker 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:20.270
 and sang to create youthful look 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:22.400
 it is nice to be in the middle of the dark 

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:24.350
 make that your highlights 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.360
 yes you can even get a volume 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.430
 effect a 3d effect but for one 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.860
 rejuvenating effect or for a very sweet person 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:33.140
 effect is nice here in the middle 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.820
 just to darken something like what 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.570
 matte a little powder 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:41.230
 to do 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:41.230
 I use the classic color of dior 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:49.790
 this is a warm big yes 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:53.240
 fix or also on I 'm cool I find warm 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:54.470
 warm and red look better on me well 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.680
 it cool 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:59.120
 can also be beautiful with you is completely 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.740
 what you need for that 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.740
 and we combine that 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.870
 put at the dentist if you go you 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:11.170
 being drilled it will tell you otherwise 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.170
 to talk 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.660
 no I notice it will do lips then 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:18.620
 I'm going to tell a story now needs 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:21.680
 she answered that when you talk 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:25.840
 so laugh then tighten your lip and then 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.840
 you can do well to him yesterday 

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:35.060
 hope of course worn at Christmas 

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:37.700
 but I also really find a color like you 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.470
 for example, you slept badly and you 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:42.290
 eyes are a bit tired and used one 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:46.220
 red lipstick from that attention film 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:49.880
 in a lips and less no tired 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:51.470
 eyes when you do the lipstick completely 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.270
 have it on him again tomorrow 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:54.480
 with the lipliner 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:58.190
 the go along 

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:58.190
 completely nice to get tight 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.040
 and make sure it is dry again 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.570
 barrier 

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:10.110
 that is better and longer for this 

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:12.420
 remains very simple 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:19.230
 we make the lip nice and tight 

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:26.940
 what a laugh you have and how beautiful 

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:29.030
