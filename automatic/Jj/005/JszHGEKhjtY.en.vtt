our<00:00:01.469> next<00:00:01.860> variable<00:00:02.159> will<00:00:02.490> be<00:00:02.520> a<00:00:02.970> boolean<00:00:03.510> so

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
our next variable will be a boolean so

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.879 
our next variable will be a boolean so
let's<00:00:04.380> declare<00:00:04.620> a<00:00:05.190> boolean<00:00:06.080> variable<00:00:07.080> up<00:00:07.230> here

what<00:00:27.690> you<00:00:27.900> need<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:28.230> do<00:00:28.410> is<00:00:29.900> when<00:00:30.900> we<00:00:31.110> click

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
what you need to do is when we click

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.030 
what you need to do is when we click
when<00:00:33.930> we<00:00:34.110> click<00:00:34.530> our<00:00:35.480> operator<00:00:36.480> here<00:00:37.040> then

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
when we click our operator here then

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.380 
when we click our operator here then
boolean<00:00:38.490> check<00:00:38.940> should<00:00:39.210> go<00:00:39.510> on<00:00:42.470> Brienne<00:00:43.470> check

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
boolean check should go on Brienne check

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:51.880 
boolean check should go on Brienne check
is<00:00:45.390> equal<00:00:45.780> to

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.920 

and<00:00:52.310> then<00:00:53.200> when<00:00:54.200> we<00:00:54.530> click<00:00:54.830> a<00:00:55.450> number<00:00:56.450> here

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
and then when we click a number here

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.080 
and then when we click a number here
you<00:00:57.020> should<00:00:57.260> check<00:00:57.740> fast<00:00:58.130> and<00:00:58.550> see<00:00:58.850> whether

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
you should check fast and see whether

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:09.630 
you should check fast and see whether
Brian<00:00:59.630> is<00:01:00.320> is<00:01:00.950> still<00:01:01.640> on<00:01:03.489> if<00:01:04.489> a<00:01:06.880> billion<00:01:07.880> check

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
Brian is is still on if a billion check

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:18.599 
Brian is is still on if a billion check
is<00:01:10.640> equal<00:01:11.270> true<00:01:13.750> true

00:01:18.599 --> 00:01:18.609 

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:24.350 

so<00:01:19.210> what<00:01:19.420> true

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.550 

ah

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.429 

then

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:33.850 

liber<00:01:31.100> one

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:40.890 

dot<00:01:34.520> text

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.450 

ah

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
ah

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.230 
ah
should<00:01:43.090> the<00:01:43.270> cuatro

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:56.420 

-<00:01:46.840> now<00:01:47.080> or<00:01:47.410> -<00:01:48.130> Blanc

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.740 

is<00:01:56.730> that<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.360> way<00:01:57.480> it's<00:01:57.630> supposed<00:01:58.050> to<00:01:58.140> be

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:09.219 

okay<00:02:03.750> so<00:02:04.170> put<00:02:04.619> we<00:02:05.549> execute<00:02:06.420> this<00:02:07.009> just<00:02:08.009> in<00:02:08.160> case

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
okay so put we execute this just in case

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:15.199 
okay so put we execute this just in case
billion<00:02:10.229> check<00:02:11.069> is<00:02:11.690> true<00:02:13.700> let's<00:02:14.700> look<00:02:14.940> at<00:02:15.060> this

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
billion check is true let's look at this

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.199 
billion check is true let's look at this
calculator<00:02:15.720> again

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.339 

or<00:02:19.269> when<00:02:20.260> we<00:02:20.409> click<00:02:20.799> a<00:02:20.829> nine<00:02:21.510> and<00:02:22.510> then<00:02:22.959> click<00:02:23.319> a

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
or when we click a nine and then click a

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:27.089 
or when we click a nine and then click a
plus<00:02:23.769> boolean<00:02:24.430> one<00:02:24.700> will<00:02:24.849> go<00:02:25.090> on<00:02:25.409> so<00:02:26.409> that<00:02:26.590> when

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:27.099 
plus boolean one will go on so that when

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:31.020 
plus boolean one will go on so that when
we<00:02:27.459> click<00:02:27.819> another<00:02:28.390> today<00:02:29.310> this<00:02:30.310> boolean<00:02:30.819> one

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
we click another today this boolean one

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:40.500 
we click another today this boolean one
is<00:02:31.239> on<00:02:35.280> it<00:02:36.280> will<00:02:36.489> clear<00:02:37.709> text<00:02:38.709> box<00:02:39.060> one<00:02:40.060> fast

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
is on it will clear text box one fast

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.699 
is on it will clear text box one fast
rather<00:02:41.310> labor<00:02:42.310> one<00:02:42.609> fast<00:02:42.969> and<00:02:43.269> then<00:02:44.200> go<00:02:44.500> ahead

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
rather labor one fast and then go ahead

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.050 
rather labor one fast and then go ahead
and<00:02:45.370> load<00:02:46.120> it<00:02:46.359> with<00:02:46.659> this<00:02:47.469> first<00:02:48.250> execute<00:02:48.760> this

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
and load it with this first execute this

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.360 
and load it with this first execute this
then<00:02:49.629> it<00:02:49.840> loads<00:02:50.109> it<00:02:50.409> with<00:02:50.680> the<00:02:51.489> number<00:02:53.370> after

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
then it loads it with the number after

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:00.710 
then it loads it with the number after
that<00:02:56.489> after<00:02:57.489> that<00:02:57.700> you<00:02:57.879> can<00:02:58.269> turn<00:02:58.659> off<00:02:58.959> a

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
that after that you can turn off a

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:10.690 
that after that you can turn off a
boolean<00:03:01.720> check<00:03:03.569> should<00:03:04.569> equal<00:03:04.930> to<00:03:05.079> false

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.420 

oh<00:03:10.730> if<00:03:11.599> I<00:03:11.810> forget<00:03:12.349> you're<00:03:12.890> seeing<00:03:13.190> me

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
oh if I forget you're seeing me

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.760 
oh if I forget you're seeing me
sometimes<00:03:14.150> using<00:03:14.540> level<00:03:14.959> sign<00:03:15.260> and<00:03:15.560> other

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:15.770 
sometimes using level sign and other

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.330 
sometimes using level sign and other
times<00:03:16.130> using<00:03:16.550> a<00:03:17.000> single<00:03:17.810> equal<00:03:18.050> sign<00:03:18.099> when<00:03:19.099> you

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
times using a single equal sign when you

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.339 
times using a single equal sign when you
are<00:03:19.489> comparing<00:03:19.970> this<00:03:20.120> is<00:03:20.360> for<00:03:20.569> comparison

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:21.349 
are comparing this is for comparison

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:24.910 
are comparing this is for comparison
so<00:03:21.770> this<00:03:21.980> first<00:03:22.250> sign<00:03:22.940> means<00:03:23.690> is<00:03:24.020> and<00:03:24.560> then<00:03:24.709> the

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
so this first sign means is and then the

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.000 
so this first sign means is and then the
other<00:03:25.069> is<00:03:25.400> equal<00:03:25.940> so<00:03:26.150> if<00:03:26.810> this<00:03:27.200> is<00:03:27.590> equal<00:03:27.800> to

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
other is equal so if this is equal to

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.760 
other is equal so if this is equal to
however<00:03:29.000> if<00:03:29.180> I<00:03:29.360> use<00:03:29.540> one<00:03:29.569> single<00:03:30.080> cent<00:03:30.410> means

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:30.770 
however if I use one single cent means

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.059 
however if I use one single cent means
I'm<00:03:31.040> assigning<00:03:31.580> value<00:03:32.450> I'm<00:03:32.660> making<00:03:33.650> boolean

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:34.069 
I'm assigning value I'm making boolean

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:36.809 
I'm assigning value I'm making boolean
check<00:03:34.430> to<00:03:34.640> become<00:03:34.970> false<00:03:35.360> that's<00:03:36.170> why<00:03:36.380> we<00:03:36.560> have

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:36.819 
check to become false that's why we have

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:39.640 
check to become false that's why we have
such<00:03:37.819> a<00:03:37.850> sign<00:03:38.209> now<00:03:38.450> let's<00:03:38.780> go<00:03:38.930> ahead<00:03:38.989> and<00:03:39.380> test

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
such a sign now let's go ahead and test

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.410 
such a sign now let's go ahead and test
our<00:03:39.890> cash<00:03:40.069> wait<00:03:40.310> and<00:03:40.519> see<00:03:40.790> how<00:03:41.060> it<00:03:41.090> works<00:03:43.420> so

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
our cash wait and see how it works so

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.809 
our cash wait and see how it works so
test<00:03:44.900> first<00:03:45.290> of<00:03:45.440> all<00:03:45.620> we<00:03:45.769> test<00:03:46.069> the

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:48.819 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:55.140 

the<00:03:49.360> small<00:03:49.629> point<00:03:51.000> 32<00:03:52.530> point<00:03:53.530> maybe<00:03:54.189> five<00:03:54.730> six

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
the small point 32 point maybe five six

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.929 
the small point 32 point maybe five six
again<00:03:55.720> a<00:03:55.750> point<00:03:56.110> so<00:03:56.980> we<00:03:57.159> can't<00:03:57.400> add<00:03:57.610> another

00:03:57.929 --> 00:03:57.939 
again a point so we can't add another

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:03.539 
again a point so we can't add another
point<00:03:58.379> plus<00:03:59.790> maybe<00:04:00.790> sixty<00:04:01.510> three<00:04:02.370> this<00:04:03.370> is

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:03.549 
point plus maybe sixty three this is

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:05.699 
point plus maybe sixty three this is
equal<00:04:03.819> to<00:04:04.140> looks<00:04:05.140> fine

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
equal to looks fine

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:12.349 
equal to looks fine
looks<00:04:06.220> fine<00:04:06.840> what<00:04:07.840> we<00:04:07.989> need<00:04:08.170> to<00:04:08.319> do<00:04:08.530> now<00:04:09.209> is<00:04:10.209> to

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359 
looks fine what we need to do now is to

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:15.780 
looks fine what we need to do now is to
look<00:04:13.359> at<00:04:13.599> the<00:04:13.810> other<00:04:13.930> buttons<00:04:14.379> as<00:04:14.530> well<00:04:14.590> so<00:04:15.220> the

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
look at the other buttons as well so the

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.789 
look at the other buttons as well so the
only<00:04:15.909> thing<00:04:16.209> we<00:04:16.359> need<00:04:16.570> to<00:04:16.600> do<00:04:16.870> is<00:04:16.989> to<00:04:17.259> copy<00:04:17.500> this

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
only thing we need to do is to copy this

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:29.250 
only thing we need to do is to copy this
I<00:04:21.270> just<00:04:22.270> copy<00:04:22.900> this

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:34.189 

and<00:04:29.380> then<00:04:30.420> put<00:04:31.420> it<00:04:31.630> down<00:04:31.660> here

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:34.199 
and then put it down here

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:38.459 
and then put it down here
and<00:04:34.289> to<00:04:34.560> make<00:04:34.830> this<00:04:35.159> on

00:04:38.459 --> 00:04:38.469 

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:43.560 

elseif

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:49.920 

and<00:04:43.950> make<00:04:44.950> this<00:04:45.190> one<00:04:45.520> a<00:04:46.260> division<00:04:48.900> necklace<00:04:49.900> a

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
and make this one a division necklace a

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.410 
and make this one a division necklace a
division<00:04:50.560> as<00:04:50.680> well

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:53.420 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:05:01.570 

we<00:04:53.780> need<00:04:53.990> to<00:04:54.170> collect<00:04:54.620> all<00:04:54.920> these<00:04:55.430> operations

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:14.840 

put<00:05:01.910> them<00:05:02.180> in<00:05:04.180> the<00:05:05.180> angle<00:05:05.840> brackets<00:05:10.120> like<00:05:11.120> that

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:22.900 

do<00:05:15.360> the<00:05:15.540> same<00:05:15.840> for<00:05:16.140> this

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:22.910 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:26.910 

put<00:05:23.390> it<00:05:23.510> in<00:05:23.740> angled<00:05:24.740> bracket

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:26.920 
put it in angled bracket

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.589 
put it in angled bracket
then

00:05:30.589 --> 00:05:30.599 

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:33.839 

ronger<00:05:31.599> depressed<00:05:32.309> should<00:05:33.309> bless<00:05:33.639> it

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:33.849 
ronger depressed should bless it

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:37.700 
ronger depressed should bless it
somewhere<00:05:34.330> here

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.700 

that<00:05:38.280> should<00:05:38.460> be<00:05:38.640> fine<00:05:38.940> so<00:05:39.810> we<00:05:40.140> are<00:05:40.320> going<00:05:40.500> to

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
that should be fine so we are going to

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:47.440 
that should be fine so we are going to
test<00:05:40.980> for<00:05:41.490> division<00:05:42.480> and<00:05:42.690> that<00:05:43.590> should<00:05:43.770> be<00:05:44.070> it

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:47.450 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:50.980 

so

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.260 

eight

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:53.270 
eight

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:58.410 
eight
/<00:05:54.229> for<00:05:55.840> support<00:05:56.840> too

00:05:58.410 --> 00:05:58.420 
/ for support too

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:04.600 
/ for support too
Plus<00:05:59.080> eight<00:06:02.010> zero<00:06:03.010> to<00:06:03.070> ten

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:04.610 
Plus eight zero to ten

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:15.469 
Plus eight zero to ten
now<00:06:05.240> all<00:06:05.569> we<00:06:05.870> need<00:06:06.050> to<00:06:06.199> do<00:06:06.409> is<00:06:06.699> copy<00:06:07.699> this

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:15.479 

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:20.239 

and<00:06:15.659> they've<00:06:15.840> got<00:06:16.050> this

00:06:20.239 --> 00:06:20.249 

00:06:20.249 --> 00:06:23.809 

come<00:06:20.909> and<00:06:21.119> test<00:06:21.449> it<00:06:21.689> here<00:06:22.019> and<00:06:23.009> changes<00:06:23.579> to

00:06:23.809 --> 00:06:23.819 
come and test it here and changes to

00:06:23.819 --> 00:06:26.850 
come and test it here and changes to
multiplication

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:26.860 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:31.540 

percussion<00:06:27.460> yeah

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:31.550 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:36.969 

then<00:06:32.440> pests<00:06:33.440> the<00:06:34.310> same<00:06:34.699> rate<00:06:35.000> their<00:06:35.860> change<00:06:36.860> it

00:06:36.969 --> 00:06:36.979 
then pests the same rate their change it

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:45.460 
then pests the same rate their change it
is<00:06:37.129> true<00:06:37.430> -<00:06:39.129> and<00:06:40.129> then<00:06:40.720> -<00:06:42.069> there<00:06:43.069> as<00:06:43.220> well

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:45.470 
is true - and then - there as well

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:50.490 
is true - and then - there as well
shall<00:06:46.070> run<00:06:46.310> it

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:50.500 

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:55.929 

nine<00:06:51.780> Fred<00:06:52.780> by

00:06:55.929 --> 00:06:55.939 

00:06:55.939 --> 00:06:59.239 

6:02<00:06:56.939> should<00:06:57.419> be<00:06:57.599> able<00:06:57.839> to<00:06:58.020> give<00:06:58.469> us<00:06:58.649> the<00:06:58.830> small

00:06:59.239 --> 00:06:59.249 
6:02 should be able to give us the small

00:06:59.249 --> 00:07:07.269 
6:02 should be able to give us the small
player<00:06:59.580> points<00:07:00.089> then<00:07:00.990> times<00:07:02.240> 10<00:07:04.159> is<00:07:05.159> equal<00:07:05.369> to

00:07:07.269 --> 00:07:07.279 
player points then times 10 is equal to

00:07:07.279 --> 00:07:15.919 
player points then times 10 is equal to
divided<00:07:08.279> by<00:07:08.699> five<00:07:09.270> is<00:07:09.860> equal<00:07:10.860> to<00:07:13.849> minus<00:07:14.929> three

00:07:15.919 --> 00:07:15.929 
divided by five is equal to minus three

00:07:15.929 --> 00:07:21.540 
divided by five is equal to minus three
