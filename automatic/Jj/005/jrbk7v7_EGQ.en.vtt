00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:10.420 
part we'll be looking at columns within

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.449 
part we'll be looking at columns within
columns<00:00:11.019> we'll<00:00:11.529> be<00:00:11.650> using<00:00:11.740> the<00:00:11.980> source<00:00:12.190> code

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:12.459 
columns we'll be using the source code

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:14.369 
columns we'll be using the source code
from<00:00:12.639> the<00:00:12.789> sixth<00:00:13.119> part<00:00:13.449> of<00:00:13.570> this<00:00:13.660> series<00:00:13.869> we

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.010 
description we have learned loads about

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:19.980 
description we have learned loads about
have<00:00:18.430> different<00:00:18.880> words<00:00:19.090> by<00:00:19.330> using<00:00:19.510> columns

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:19.990 
have different words by using columns

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.470 
have different words by using columns
but<00:00:20.560> I<00:00:20.710> met<00:00:21.130> to<00:00:21.220> blow<00:00:21.550> your<00:00:21.790> mind<00:00:22.090> with<00:00:22.270> this

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:22.480 
but I met to blow your mind with this

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.720 
but I met to blow your mind with this
tutorial<00:00:22.660> simply<00:00:23.560> you<00:00:23.890> can<00:00:24.039> put<00:00:24.250> column

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:24.730 
tutorial simply you can put column

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.480 
tutorial simply you can put column
within<00:00:25.270> columns<00:00:25.810> and<00:00:26.020> those<00:00:26.470> columns<00:00:26.980> have

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:27.490 
within columns and those columns have

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.090 
within columns and those columns have
the<00:00:27.640> same<00:00:27.910> 12<00:00:28.360> grid<00:00:28.630> based<00:00:28.900> rule<00:00:29.199> but<00:00:29.680> here<00:00:29.920> is

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:30.100 
the same 12 grid based rule but here is

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.459 
the same 12 grid based rule but here is
where<00:00:30.280> it<00:00:30.550> gets<00:00:30.730> interesting<00:00:30.970> it<00:00:31.449> to<00:00:31.690> 12<00:00:32.259> with

00:00:32.459 --> 00:00:32.469 
where it gets interesting it to 12 with

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:34.950 
where it gets interesting it to 12 with
places<00:00:32.890> of<00:00:33.100> inner<00:00:33.489> columns<00:00:33.940> span<00:00:34.510> the<00:00:34.719> outer

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960 
places of inner columns span the outer

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.529 
places of inner columns span the outer
column<00:00:35.620> not<00:00:35.859> the<00:00:36.100> actual<00:00:36.579> browser<00:00:36.850> width<00:00:37.300> or

00:00:37.529 --> 00:00:37.539 
column not the actual browser width or

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:42.239 
column not the actual browser width or
the<00:00:37.569> actual<00:00:38.559> outer<00:00:39.039> grid<00:00:39.760> size<00:00:40.269> so<00:00:41.050> if<00:00:41.530> we<00:00:41.979> have

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:42.249 
the actual outer grid size so if we have

00:00:42.249 --> 00:00:45.509 
the actual outer grid size so if we have
a<00:00:42.489> column<00:00:42.909> that<00:00:43.059> is<00:00:43.210> 6<00:00:43.510> columns<00:00:43.929> wide<00:00:44.229> and<00:00:44.589> we

00:00:45.509 --> 00:00:45.519 
a column that is 6 columns wide and we

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:48.299 
a column that is 6 columns wide and we
have<00:00:45.789> 2<00:00:45.999> columns<00:00:46.239> inside<00:00:47.109> that<00:00:47.499> there<00:00:47.859> are<00:00:47.979> 6

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309 
have 2 columns inside that there are 6

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:50.369 
have 2 columns inside that there are 6
wide<00:00:48.789> then<00:00:49.389> the<00:00:49.600> inner<00:00:49.809> column<00:00:50.229> will

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:50.379 
wide then the inner column will

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:53.069 
wide then the inner column will
technically<00:00:50.829> be<00:00:50.920> 25%<00:00:51.609> of<00:00:52.059> the<00:00:52.179> overall<00:00:52.210> grid

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 
technically be 25% of the overall grid

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:55.649 
technically be 25% of the overall grid
system<00:00:53.469> it<00:00:53.889> allows<00:00:54.039> you<00:00:54.579> as<00:00:54.789> a<00:00:54.819> developer<00:00:54.940> to

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:55.659 
system it allows you as a developer to

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:57.959 
system it allows you as a developer to
get<00:00:55.809> around<00:00:56.139> 12<00:00:56.469> grid<00:00:56.710> space<00:00:56.949> rule<00:00:57.280> first<00:00:57.819> of

00:00:57.959 --> 00:00:57.969 
get around 12 grid space rule first of

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:00.209 
get around 12 grid space rule first of
all<00:00:58.120> let's<00:00:58.569> implement<00:00:59.530> what<00:00:59.889> we've<00:01:00.069> been

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:00.219 
all let's implement what we've been

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:02.430 
all let's implement what we've been
discussing<00:01:00.339> so<00:01:01.120> let's<00:01:01.539> just<00:01:01.690> open<00:01:01.809> up<00:01:02.199> our

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
discussing so let's just open up our

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.889 
discussing so let's just open up our
project<00:01:03.129> in<00:01:03.940> a<00:01:04.089> text<00:01:04.510> editor<00:01:06.780> what<00:01:07.780> we're

00:01:07.889 --> 00:01:07.899 
project in a text editor what we're

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:11.850 
project in a text editor what we're
going<00:01:08.020> to<00:01:08.049> do<00:01:08.289> is<00:01:08.500> just<00:01:08.860> remove<00:01:09.310> all<00:01:10.350> of<00:01:11.350> these

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
going to do is just remove all of these

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.429 
going to do is just remove all of these
columns<00:01:12.850> right<00:01:13.390> here<00:01:14.100> remove<00:01:15.100> them<00:01:15.280> all<00:01:16.439> get

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:17.439 
columns right here remove them all get

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:20.609 
columns right here remove them all get
rid<00:01:17.740> of<00:01:17.770> them<00:01:18.130> and<00:01:19.140> then<00:01:20.140> what<00:01:20.320> we're<00:01:20.439> going<00:01:20.560> to

I'm<00:05:24.010> going<00:05:24.520> within<00:05:24.790> each<00:05:25.120> deal<00:05:25.480> we<00:05:25.690> have<00:05:25.930> two

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:26.530 
I'm going within each deal we have two

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:30.120 
I'm going within each deal we have two
more<00:05:26.800> divs<00:05:27.580> which<00:05:28.060> spans<00:05:28.390> six<00:05:28.690> columns<00:05:29.200> 6

more divs which spans six columns 6
column<00:05:30.430> six<00:05:30.850> columns<00:05:31.120> and<00:05:31.270> as<00:05:31.390> you<00:05:31.510> can<00:05:31.660> see

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:31.720 
column six columns and as you can see

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.530 
column six columns and as you can see
these<00:05:32.440> six<00:05:32.680> columns<00:05:33.010> is<00:05:33.280> just<00:05:33.580> the<00:05:33.730> half<00:05:34.150> of

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:34.540 
these six columns is just the half of

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:38.640 
these six columns is just the half of
the<00:05:35.230> outer<00:05:35.530> div<00:05:36.070> is<00:05:36.250> not<00:05:36.670> relative<00:05:37.150> to<00:05:37.650> the

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:38.650 
the outer div is not relative to the

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.430 
the outer div is not relative to the
grid<00:05:39.400> itself<00:05:40.120> or<00:05:40.510> the<00:05:40.660> browser<00:05:40.960> so<00:05:41.290> if<00:05:41.350> you

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 
grid itself or the browser so if you

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.430 
grid itself or the browser so if you
resize<00:05:41.980> this<00:05:42.250> Alexis<00:05:42.760> resizing<00:05:43.660> when<00:05:44.200> we<00:05:44.290> go

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:44.440 
resize this Alexis resizing when we go

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.830 
resize this Alexis resizing when we go
really<00:05:44.770> small<00:05:45.160> it's<00:05:45.490> on<00:05:45.910> top<00:05:46.300> of<00:05:46.330> each<00:05:46.570> other

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:46.840 
really small it's on top of each other

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.170 
really small it's on top of each other
and<00:05:47.050> then<00:05:47.260> the<00:05:47.380> margin<00:05:47.680> -<00:05:48.190> bottom<00:05:48.640> comes<00:05:48.910> into

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.180 
and then the margin - bottom comes into

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:49.680 
and then the margin - bottom comes into
effect

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:49.690 
effect

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:52.100 
effect
so<00:05:50.050> they're<00:05:50.320> basically<00:05:50.770> not<00:05:50.890> touching<00:05:51.640> and

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.110 
so they're basically not touching and

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.050 
so they're basically not touching and
there<00:05:53.110> you<00:05:53.230> go<00:05:53.410> you<00:05:53.470> basically<00:05:54.040> have<00:05:54.460> deals

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:55.060 
there you go you basically have deals

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.110 
there you go you basically have deals
with<00:05:55.270> in<00:05:55.390> the<00:05:55.830> columns<00:05:56.830> within<00:05:57.070> columns<00:05:57.670> it's

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:58.120 
with in the columns within columns it's

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.420 
with in the columns within columns it's
a<00:05:58.270> great<00:05:58.630> way<00:05:58.870> to<00:05:58.900> be<00:05:59.230> able<00:05:59.350> to<00:05:59.560> organize<00:05:59.860> it

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:00.430 
a great way to be able to organize it

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.310 
a great way to be able to organize it
and<00:06:00.610> your<00:06:01.270> code<00:06:01.510> so<00:06:01.540> if<00:06:01.810> you<00:06:01.900> have<00:06:01.990> some<00:06:02.140> for<00:06:02.290> a

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:02.320 
and your code so if you have some for a

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.380 
and your code so if you have some for a
blog<00:06:02.710> you<00:06:03.370> could<00:06:03.610> instead<00:06:03.970> of<00:06:04.090> just<00:06:04.180> having

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:04.390 
blog you could instead of just having

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:06.780 
blog you could instead of just having
one<00:06:04.840> column<00:06:05.590> and<00:06:05.740> then<00:06:05.890> another<00:06:06.070> column<00:06:06.520> you

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:06.790 
one column and then another column you

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:10.470 
one column and then another column you
can<00:06:06.940> have<00:06:07.150> the<00:06:07.930> main<00:06:08.440> column<00:06:08.800> which<00:06:09.250> has<00:06:09.480> your

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:10.480 
can have the main column which has your

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.900 
can have the main column which has your
content<00:06:11.140> your<00:06:11.290> blog<00:06:11.530> post<00:06:11.830> and<00:06:12.130> within<00:06:12.580> there

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:12.910 
content your blog post and within there

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:16.370 
content your blog post and within there
you<00:06:13.030> can<00:06:13.210> maybe<00:06:13.390> just<00:06:13.570> have<00:06:13.990> a<00:06:14.020> column<00:06:14.530> for<00:06:15.250> the

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:16.380 
you can maybe just have a column for the

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:19.650 
you can maybe just have a column for the
Neum<00:06:17.410> from<00:06:18.280> now<00:06:18.430> there<00:06:18.700> may<00:06:18.850> be<00:06:18.880> a<00:06:19.000> column<00:06:19.450> for

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:19.660 
Neum from now there may be a column for

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:23.130 
Neum from now there may be a column for
the<00:06:19.990> actual<00:06:20.620> meat<00:06:21.010> of<00:06:21.190> the<00:06:21.280> blog<00:06:21.520> so<00:06:22.360> adding

not a fudge or anything like that and
it's<00:06:30.550> pretty<00:06:30.730> crazy<00:06:30.970> what<00:06:31.300> you<00:06:31.390> can<00:06:31.540> do<00:06:31.720> it

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:31.990 
it's pretty crazy what you can do it

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:34.320 
it's pretty crazy what you can do it
here<00:06:32.200> is<00:06:32.350> that<00:06:32.380> here<00:06:32.800> is<00:06:32.920> a<00:06:32.950> task<00:06:33.280> for<00:06:33.400> you<00:06:33.610> make

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:34.330 
here is that here is a task for you make

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.320 
here is that here is a task for you make
the<00:06:34.510> columns<00:06:35.020> inside<00:06:35.650> aka<00:06:36.220> these<00:06:36.760> two<00:06:37.030> and

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:37.330 
the columns inside aka these two and

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.180 
the columns inside aka these two and
these<00:06:38.260> two

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:39.190 
these two

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:41.400 
these two
so<00:06:39.430> they<00:06:39.580> have<00:06:39.820> had<00:06:40.090> in<00:06:40.510> a<00:06:40.690> random<00:06:41.110> so<00:06:41.260> they

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:41.410 
so they have had in a random so they

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:44.250 
so they have had in a random so they
aren't<00:06:41.740> touching<00:06:42.220> each<00:06:42.490> other<00:06:42.730> like<00:06:43.390> this<00:06:43.720> may

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:44.260 
aren't touching each other like this may

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:48.690 
aren't touching each other like this may
come<00:06:44.560> how<00:06:45.190> these<00:06:45.520> two<00:06:46.030> are<00:06:46.680> okay<00:06:47.680> in<00:06:48.250> terms<00:06:48.460> of

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:48.700 
come how these two are okay in terms of

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.210 
come how these two are okay in terms of
the<00:06:48.880> gap<00:06:49.270> here<00:06:49.750> the<00:06:50.320> next<00:06:50.590> tutorial<00:06:50.980> will
