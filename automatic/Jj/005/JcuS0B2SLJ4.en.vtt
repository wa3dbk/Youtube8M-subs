 dude doing there one way up with 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:41.129
 a coup captain lift I decided 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.989
 also try it I started celandine 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.649
 St. Petersburg rise two days later I would 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.500
 learned 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.140
 then learned the rise with a coup right away 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.399
 well then after the British rise then 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.710
 learned to exit one 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.960
 then you nabieva them as it went and 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.110
 here I first will be engaged somewhere 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.870
 all in a row there is a chair there 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:04.589
 there is a prince exit all such 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.090
 elementary simple technique for became 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.850
 engage here just as even 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.070
 tasted well there sauce twist the moon all 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.409
 it goes and then I learned about 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.670
 jimbo that there is such an element on 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.820
 one hand is performed 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.070
 and decided to try it here 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.600
 I first learned and this is the way out without 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:26.040
 it was one from 2020 on December 31 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.280
 then after a while I learned 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.950
 media j later about 2 days later I am 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.369
 learned kris or god 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.030
 hyper god magnum and the hollow the teeth 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.030
 simple elements 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:45.360
 shuya small town we only have a lot of you 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:47.579
 people do what it is connected with but 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.040
 the fact that many see as I do, and 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.200
 they liked it and I who have already started 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.750
 train call yourself train 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.719
 there every day and that's how it is 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.790
 started to deal with the same question from Michael 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.439
 chemically and after how much after the start 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.799
 stink it made his first little thing 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.550
 going over a month later i'm done by 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.040
 Mondays voices 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.130
 Question from Leonid Novikov Why do you 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:14.320
 like precisely intercept 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.940
 Well, because I first taught the elements 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.640
 without interceptions all these 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.680
 decided to complicate something and tried with 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.120
 interception they me while you liked 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.310
 intrigued i started doing and 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.170
 the rest with the interception and the other element 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.850
 as I am not interested in the question of new from 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.820
 Michael Khimich and what is your favorite 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:34.080
 element but my favorite element 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.080
 antiseptic londa 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.319
 question again you syncola him what 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.410
 how do you think the most difficult interception 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:44.390
 on her in your performance well my 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.660
 performance the most difficult intercepting 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:50.240
 yota and trump this element came up with me and 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.060
 performed it first like this item 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:58.250
 are performed but this item is dodging 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:03:01.160
 That's how to fold about humidity 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:04.489
 soars toss the body to the horizontal bar right 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:06.709
 very close is not enough to defort it 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:09.530
 kingdom is not ok here's a cop 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:12.650
 performed as well as interception on her at all 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:16.040
 what is the most difficult do you think but i 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:18.530
 I think tramp question from the game trohimchuk 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:22.090
 some elements you will continue to learn from 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:25.250
 transient well, then I plan 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:27.890
 complicate the tramp metal flag it 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:32.540
 do with interception do it with two 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:34.880
 interceptions but I plan to work 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.700
 much interception and do this intro 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:40.220
 the wise men of the artistâ€™s mustache there 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:44.000
 modify the old big then something 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:46.519
 complicate is simple but it's a secret question 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.570
 which probably torment many asked him 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:49.940
 whether name is Noah 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:53.930
 how to get rid of fear of interception 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:56.180
 and contour well for starters put something 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:59.209
 on a horizontal bar that the fear was gone 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.310
 then you learn the elements with this but with 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:03.320
 mattress at least and then just him 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:07.070
 brothers work out the same thing without 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:09.829
 he got rid of questions like this 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:12.260
 Denis Kudinova or you have an injury after 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:13.579
 which you could not do yes to me 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.579
 there were 2 injuries 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:18.440
 Once I turned Russian turns and on 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:21.380
 communication did not I began to hurt my arm much 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:26.180
 I went to the elbow surgeon that I had 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:28.520
 broken well elbow here then I had 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:31.010
 injury I hurt the rib when rued 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.470
 I did not study on the spot I could not take 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:36.560
 in general you quadra here these are blown only 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.190
 were no longer cheerfully cyanide issues 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.610
 Novikov 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:42.950
 You thought about what the bar but at first 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.870
 two months later take a gym bar i 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:47.870
 think of everything that hurted 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.400
 back hurt all the compositions dig but i 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.590
 then 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.710
 this is so at first and then everything will pass 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:56.650
 and over time it all passed and no longer 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:59.220
 I think jimbori question Dima was 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.900
 him that inspires you 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:07.300
 Well, I do not even know how to answer this 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:08.889
 I am inspired by other people 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.530
 who shoot a jimbo frame from them 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:13.600
 level let's put I have 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.910
 I watch them not videos and see new items 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.100
 and trying to repeat it and every time I 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:20.979
 I am reviewing these people from here , 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:24.840
 today here they inspire me and what 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:27.760
 your favorite video we wait barre ie 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:30.639
 but I like the video of Artem Kovalev 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:33.280
 2 and your report Dima Petrov like 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:35.919
 video have rashl good video y 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.860
 I don't like the charente and I don't like it very much 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:41.229
 in the bumper what do you think are the most 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:44.410
 Strongest Boris in the world 

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:46.210
 if colombians come in 

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:48.070
 Colombians generally did not pay the numbers by 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:50.199
 my opinion and here 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:55.030
 of ours I am that the strongest wrestler 

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:58.240
 now but this is dimon petrov there and 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:06:00.610
 novorishi konov kovalev too much 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:04.060
 barista but he is very crooked all 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:06.419
 Dima points and introduces a number of strong fighter 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:09.699
 in my opinion 

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:11.919
 Well, stump, too, I think they have a daughter 

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:13.570
 the Prussians level maybe they occupy 

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:15.669
 I don't know, I can't talk 

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:18.280
 another question from his novosinkovo 

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:21.370
 Do you know how power elements like plate 

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:24.190
 mexicans it and so on not like that 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:26.620
 items i don't know you said you didn't 

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:27.960
 do the power elements he you yourself do not 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:30.340
 limited only 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:32.070
 control we intercept them though 

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:35.260
 you still have a big part 

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:38.199
 in connection with this question many people wrote 

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:40.210
 that you have a neville curve but not 

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:43.060
 worked out the elements and 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:45.550
 you only do mainstream what can you 

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:48.520
 say it but first yes yes somehow I donâ€™t 

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:50.770
 practiced the exchange filed first year well 

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:52.389
 first match annual report I do in it 

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:53.249
 did not work out amit did three times 

00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:55.019
 each item 

00:06:53.249 --> 00:06:57.479
 that is, did not look at the quality did not follow 

00:06:55.019 --> 00:07:00.389
 for this then they did not write this one 

00:06:57.479 --> 00:07:03.449
 criticism of what i'm doing is crooked there some 

00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:05.489
 elements i started them already somehow try 

00:07:03.449 --> 00:07:07.229
 work out but there is such a question 

00:07:05.489 --> 00:07:09.209
 some cops can't work not 

00:07:07.229 --> 00:07:12.239
 it turns out this is not a fret 

00:07:09.209 --> 00:07:14.429
 do not change it in any way but I just did 

00:07:12.239 --> 00:07:16.979
 min stream at the beginning and now I started 

00:07:14.429 --> 00:07:19.139
 try yourself in a gyros well, that is, in 

00:07:16.979 --> 00:07:21.119
 rpm and here's my next report 

00:07:19.139 --> 00:07:23.669
 which will be I think dressed through 

00:07:21.119 --> 00:07:27.499
 six months or a year will be her 

00:07:23.669 --> 00:07:32.059
 turns and power elements waste 

00:07:27.499 --> 00:07:32.059
 it was an interview with Mr. Kozyrev 

00:07:37.399 --> 00:07:43.669
 subscribe to our public 

00:07:39.149 --> 00:07:43.669
 make reposts and wait for new videos
