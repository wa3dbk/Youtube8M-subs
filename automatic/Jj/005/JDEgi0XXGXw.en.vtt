1.5<00:00:48.730> this<00:00:49.090> has<00:00:49.239> been<00:00:49.420> broken<00:00:49.840> this<00:00:50.559> is<00:00:50.620> because

00:00:51.029 --> 00:00:51.039 
1.5 this has been broken this is because

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:52.889 
1.5 this has been broken this is because
the<00:00:51.219> double<00:00:51.520> piston<00:00:51.699> extender<00:00:52.270> right<00:00:52.570> here

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:52.899 
the double piston extender right here

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:54.689 
the double piston extender right here
that<00:00:53.109> push<00:00:53.320> it<00:00:53.469> pushes<00:00:53.920> the<00:00:54.100> dis<00:00:54.340> diamond

00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:54.699 
that push it pushes the dis diamond

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:57.150 
that push it pushes the dis diamond
block<00:00:54.910> to<00:00:55.719> the<00:00:55.840> center<00:00:56.170> there<00:00:56.379> that<00:00:56.530> has<00:00:56.980> been

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160 
block to the center there that has been

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.990 
block to the center there that has been
broken<00:00:58.859> but<00:00:59.859> I<00:00:59.920> found<00:01:00.129> a<00:01:00.280> way<00:01:00.309> around<00:01:00.430> it<00:01:00.820> by

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
broken but I found a way around it by

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.599 
broken but I found a way around it by
using<00:01:01.210> a<00:01:01.570> double<00:01:02.050> edge<00:01:02.379> monostable<00:01:03.070> circuit

00:01:03.599 --> 00:01:03.609 
using a double edge monostable circuit

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:05.160 
using a double edge monostable circuit
and<00:01:04.210> now<00:01:04.510> it<00:01:04.600> should<00:01:04.720> be<00:01:04.780> working<00:01:05.019> perfectly

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
and now it should be working perfectly

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.560 
and now it should be working perfectly
for<00:01:05.620> Minecraft<00:01:06.040> versions<00:01:06.460> 1.5<00:01:07.270> and<00:01:07.450> up

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570

by seven area that you would like to
place<00:01:11.650> your<00:01:11.799> 3x3<00:01:12.340> door<00:01:12.580> on<00:01:12.729> alright<00:01:13.540> so<00:01:13.659> after

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
place your 3x3 door on alright so after

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:14.999 
place your 3x3 door on alright so after
you<00:01:13.930> found<00:01:14.080> that<00:01:14.259> area<00:01:14.560> we're<00:01:14.710> going<00:01:14.830> to<00:01:14.890> do

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:15.009 
you found that area we're going to do

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:16.530 
you found that area we're going to do
something<00:01:15.369> real<00:01:15.520> quick<00:01:15.549> so<00:01:16.000> you<00:01:16.030> can<00:01:16.150> get<00:01:16.360> your

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
something real quick so you can get your

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.810 
something real quick so you can get your
so<00:01:17.259> you<00:01:17.320> can<00:01:17.560> know<00:01:17.680> exactly<00:01:17.860> where<00:01:18.460> to<00:01:18.490> place

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
so you can know exactly where to place

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.850 
so you can know exactly where to place
this<00:01:19.060> all<00:01:19.869> right<00:01:19.990> so<00:01:20.170> pretend<00:01:20.500> this<00:01:20.619> is<00:01:20.740> the

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
this all right so pretend this is the

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.100 
this all right so pretend this is the
ground<00:01:21.100> and<00:01:21.490> this<00:01:22.329> is<00:01:22.479> where<00:01:22.630> you<00:01:22.750> want<00:01:22.960> your

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
ground and this is where you want your

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.010 
ground and this is where you want your
3x3<00:01:23.740> door<00:01:24.040> to<00:01:24.189> be<00:01:24.310> so<00:01:24.939> it<00:01:25.329> would<00:01:25.540> be<00:01:25.659> like<00:01:25.840> this

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
3x3 door to be so it would be like this

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.319 
3x3 door to be so it would be like this
right<00:01:26.350> so<00:01:27.340> we're<00:01:27.670> about<00:01:27.700> to<00:01:27.939> make<00:01:28.150> our

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:28.329 
right so we're about to make our

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:30.420 
right so we're about to make our
reference<00:01:28.780> point<00:01:28.869> for<00:01:29.350> exactly<00:01:29.890> the<00:01:30.070> spot<00:01:30.280> to

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
reference point for exactly the spot to

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.969 
reference point for exactly the spot to
build<00:01:30.520> this<00:01:30.700> on<00:01:30.850> so<00:01:31.840> if<00:01:32.049> you<00:01:32.170> have<00:01:32.320> your<00:01:32.439> 3x3

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
build this on so if you have your 3x3

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:34.200 
build this on so if you have your 3x3
door<00:01:33.159> and<00:01:33.400> you<00:01:33.520> know<00:01:33.640> it's<00:01:33.820> going<00:01:33.909> to<00:01:34.030> want<00:01:34.150> to

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
door and you know it's going to want to

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.350 
door and you know it's going to want to
be<00:01:34.470> break<00:01:35.470> these<00:01:35.799> two<00:01:35.829> out<00:01:36.159> and<00:01:36.369> place<00:01:37.149> two

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
be break these two out and place two

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.139 
be break these two out and place two
sticky<00:01:37.689> pistons<00:01:38.079> like<00:01:38.259> that<00:01:38.500> and<00:01:39.030> then<00:01:40.030> there

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:40.149 
sticky pistons like that and then there

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:42.090 
sticky pistons like that and then there
should<00:01:40.299> be<00:01:40.329> one<00:01:40.420> block<00:01:40.810> right<00:01:41.170> here<00:01:41.470> with<00:01:41.920> the

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
should be one block right here with the

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.010 
should be one block right here with the
ground<00:01:42.340> see<00:01:42.759> that<00:01:42.970> so<00:01:43.240> that's<00:01:43.420> the<00:01:43.840> height

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
ground see that so that's the height

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.230 
ground see that so that's the height
that<00:01:44.140> the<00:01:44.259> sticky<00:01:44.530> Bishop<00:01:44.950> yet<00:01:45.189> alright<00:01:46.060> so

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
that the sticky Bishop yet alright so

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.550 
that the sticky Bishop yet alright so
now<00:01:46.360> that<00:01:46.390> you<00:01:46.600> have<00:01:46.750> your<00:01:46.899> little<00:01:47.079> reference

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
now that you have your little reference

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.170 
now that you have your little reference
point<00:01:47.799> let's<00:01:48.009> get<00:01:48.130> right<00:01:48.340> in<00:01:48.579> to<00:01:48.909> where<00:01:49.060> it

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
point let's get right in to where it

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.270 
point let's get right in to where it
gets<00:01:49.360> difficult<00:01:49.950> you're<00:01:50.950> going<00:01:51.070> to<00:01:51.130> want<00:01:51.250> to

just<00:02:30.239> put<00:02:30.390> it<00:02:30.480> back<00:02:30.739> put<00:02:31.739> it<00:02:31.860> back<00:02:31.890> where<00:02:32.130> it

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
just put it back put it back where it

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.400 
just put it back put it back where it
belongs<00:02:32.489> and<00:02:32.880> that<00:02:33.690> should<00:02:33.870> be<00:02:33.989> the<00:02:34.020> double

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
belongs and that should be the double

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.640 
belongs and that should be the double
piston<00:02:34.709> extender<00:02:35.040> so<00:02:35.310> it<00:02:36.000> extends<00:02:36.600> but<00:02:37.530> it

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
piston extender so it extends but it

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.710 
piston extender so it extends but it
will<00:02:37.739> not<00:02:37.920> retract<00:02:38.400> yet<00:02:38.610> as<00:02:38.760> you<00:02:39.390> can<00:02:39.540> see

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
will not retract yet as you can see

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.930 
will not retract yet as you can see
we'll<00:02:40.170> need<00:02:40.290> to<00:02:40.440> add<00:02:40.560> that<00:02:40.770> in<00:02:40.950> real<00:02:41.160> quick<00:02:41.370> so

going<00:03:23.280> to<00:03:23.400> be<00:03:23.489> using<00:03:23.640> diamond<00:03:23.970> blocks<00:03:24.180> so<00:03:24.359> I'm

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
going to be using diamond blocks so I'm

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.000 
going to be using diamond blocks so I'm
going<00:03:24.600> to<00:03:24.630> change<00:03:24.780> these<00:03:25.019> real<00:03:25.260> quick<00:03:25.470> this

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
going to change these real quick this

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.190 
going to change these real quick this
will<00:03:26.190> be<00:03:26.280> the<00:03:26.400> inner<00:03:26.549> 3x3<00:03:27.209> area<00:03:27.239> of<00:03:27.720> your<00:03:27.870> door

so keep that in mind and to complete

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:34.580 
so keep that in mind and to complete
this<00:03:31.230> you<00:03:31.650> will<00:03:31.769> put<00:03:31.950> a<00:03:32.150> block<00:03:33.150> there<00:03:33.590> redstone

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
this you will put a block there redstone

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.960 
this you will put a block there redstone
repeater<00:03:34.890> to<00:03:35.070> the<00:03:35.190> fourth<00:03:35.640> delay<00:03:36.000> and<00:03:36.680> finally

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
repeater to the fourth delay and finally

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.509 
repeater to the fourth delay and finally
one<00:03:38.970> redstone<00:03:39.480> dust<00:03:39.930> and<00:03:40.380> that<00:03:41.040> should<00:03:41.220> top<00:03:41.370> it

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
one redstone dust and that should top it

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:42.759 
one redstone dust and that should top it
off<00:03:41.640> what<00:03:41.850> see<00:03:42.000> if<00:03:42.060> it<00:03:42.150> works

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
off what see if it works

into this spiral part of this door so

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.560 
into this spiral part of this door so
now<00:03:54.840> we're<00:03:54.990> going<00:03:55.080> to<00:03:55.170> put<00:03:55.380> our<00:03:56.030> edge<00:03:57.030> Pistons

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
now we're going to put our edge Pistons

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:04.130 
now we're going to put our edge Pistons
in<00:03:57.780> put<00:03:58.530> two<00:03:58.770> here<00:03:59.190> and<00:03:59.340> two<00:04:00.470> here<00:04:02.990> just<00:04:03.990> like

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
in put two here and two here just like

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.590 
in put two here and two here just like
this<00:04:04.380> and<00:04:04.620> make<00:04:05.250> sure<00:04:05.459> to<00:04:05.940> break<00:04:06.150> this<00:04:06.360> block

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
this and make sure to break this block

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.260 
this and make sure to break this block
because<00:04:07.050> see<00:04:07.860> see<00:04:08.250> that<00:04:08.280> it<00:04:08.880> wouldn't<00:04:09.150> have

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.270 
because see see that it wouldn't have

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:10.970 
because see see that it wouldn't have
worked<00:04:09.450> so<00:04:09.780> make<00:04:10.260> sure<00:04:10.290> to<00:04:10.470> pick<00:04:10.620> that<00:04:10.740> block

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
worked so make sure to pick that block

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.199 
worked so make sure to pick that block
after<00:04:11.160> you're<00:04:11.370> done<00:04:11.459> putting<00:04:11.700> those<00:04:11.850> Pistons

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
this side we're going to place a

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.599 
this side we're going to place a
redstone<00:04:16.170> repeater<00:04:16.650> right<00:04:16.859> here<00:04:17.130> so<00:04:17.459> this

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
redstone repeater right here so this

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.250 
redstone repeater right here so this
block<00:04:17.790> will<00:04:17.940> now<00:04:18.030> have<00:04:18.180> to<00:04:18.359> own<00:04:18.510> two<00:04:18.959> on<00:04:19.140> each

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
block will now have to own two on each

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.640 
block will now have to own two on each
side<00:04:19.500> of<00:04:19.530> it<00:04:19.970> another<00:04:20.970> block<00:04:21.290> another<00:04:22.290> torch
