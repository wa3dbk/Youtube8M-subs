tester<00:00:15.680> now<00:00:16.670> in<00:00:17.000> this<00:00:17.240> particular<00:00:17.570> tester<00:00:18.230> is

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:18.500 
tester now in this particular tester is

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.560 
tester now in this particular tester is
not<00:00:18.770> the<00:00:18.920> vertex<00:00:19.400> but<00:00:19.580> it's<00:00:19.730> very<00:00:19.880> similar<00:00:20.270> and

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.570 
not the vertex but it's very similar and

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.960 
not the vertex but it's very similar and
a<00:00:21.290> lot<00:00:21.530> of<00:00:21.650> times<00:00:21.860> people<00:00:22.070> get<00:00:22.370> these<00:00:22.550> machines

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:22.970 
a lot of times people get these machines

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.470 
a lot of times people get these machines
or<00:00:23.240> they<00:00:24.220> try<00:00:25.220> to<00:00:25.250> do<00:00:25.700> some<00:00:25.940> of<00:00:25.970> the<00:00:26.090> exercises

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
or they try to do some of the exercises

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.720 
or they try to do some of the exercises
or<00:00:26.990> the<00:00:27.080> drills<00:00:27.380> and<00:00:27.470> they<00:00:27.560> do<00:00:27.740> improperly<00:00:28.460> in

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730

this<00:00:29.119> first<00:00:29.360> video<00:00:29.570> I'm<00:00:29.810> just<00:00:29.869> explaining<00:00:30.500> to

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:30.740 
this first video I'm just explaining to

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.620 
this first video I'm just explaining to
you<00:00:30.860> how<00:00:31.070> this<00:00:31.250> thing<00:00:31.310> actually<00:00:31.669> works<00:00:32.090> and

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:32.630 
you how this thing actually works and

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.630 
you how this thing actually works and
how<00:00:32.780> it<00:00:32.840> actually<00:00:32.900> measures<00:00:33.500> your<00:00:34.220> vertical

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
how it actually measures your vertical

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:42.910 
how it actually measures your vertical
leap<00:00:39.910> okay<00:00:40.910> okay<00:00:41.780> now<00:00:42.260> that<00:00:42.500> we<00:00:42.590> have<00:00:42.770> the

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
leap okay okay now that we have the

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.500 
leap okay okay now that we have the
measurement<00:00:43.370> which<00:00:43.640> is<00:00:43.790> seven<00:00:44.120> foot<00:00:44.300> nine

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
measurement which is seven foot nine

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.690 
measurement which is seven foot nine
inches<00:00:44.870> we<00:00:45.380> know<00:00:45.590> where<00:00:46.100> we're<00:00:46.280> starting<00:00:46.370> from

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:46.700 
inches we know where we're starting from

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.270 
inches we know where we're starting from
this<00:00:47.030> is<00:00:47.180> the<00:00:47.300> baseline<00:00:47.780> so<00:00:48.260> we<00:00:48.949> have<00:00:49.129> to

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
this is the baseline so we have to

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.590 
this is the baseline so we have to
change<00:00:49.460> the<00:00:49.670> height<00:00:49.820> that<00:00:50.090> was<00:00:50.239> suitable

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
change the height that was suitable

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.849 
change the height that was suitable
enough<00:00:50.780> to<00:00:50.930> find<00:00:51.170> out<00:00:51.260> what<00:00:51.379> you're<00:00:51.530> standing

00:00:51.849 --> 00:00:51.859 
enough to find out what you're standing

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:53.650 
enough to find out what you're standing
reaches<00:00:52.219> but<00:00:52.760> in<00:00:52.879> order<00:00:53.120> to<00:00:53.180> figure<00:00:53.359> out<00:00:53.539> what

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
reaches but in order to figure out what

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.150 
reaches but in order to figure out what
my<00:00:53.750> vertical<00:00:54.050> leap<00:00:54.289> is<00:00:54.440> we<00:00:54.710> need<00:00:54.859> to<00:00:54.949> raise<00:00:55.129> it

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
my vertical leap is we need to raise it

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.119 
my vertical leap is we need to raise it
up<00:00:55.399> to<00:00:55.609> a<00:00:55.640> least<00:00:55.910> 11<00:00:56.300> feet<00:00:56.539> all<00:00:57.320> right<00:00:57.469> now<00:00:57.859> it's

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
up to a least 11 feet all right now it's

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:00.970 
up to a least 11 feet all right now it's
set<00:00:58.309> at<00:00:58.460> 11<00:00:58.850> feet<00:00:59.030> at<00:00:59.239> the<00:00:59.359> very<00:00:59.600> top<00:00:59.870> so<00:01:00.199> you

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
set at 11 feet at the very top so you

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.590 
set at 11 feet at the very top so you
probably<00:01:01.340> notice<00:01:01.730> that<00:01:01.879> some<00:01:02.120> of<00:01:02.239> the<00:01:02.329> pigs

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
probably notice that some of the pigs

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.660 
probably notice that some of the pigs
are<00:01:02.929> already<00:01:03.379> hit<00:01:03.649> and<00:01:03.890> the<00:01:04.010> reason<00:01:04.280> why<00:01:04.400> I<00:01:04.430> did

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
are already hit and the reason why I did

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.490 
are already hit and the reason why I did
that<00:01:04.699> is<00:01:04.970> because<00:01:05.120> if<00:01:05.600> you're<00:01:06.080> going<00:01:06.320> up<00:01:06.470> to

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
that is because if you're going up to

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.950 
that is because if you're going up to
make<00:01:06.770> an<00:01:06.920> attempt<00:01:07.340> or<00:01:07.460> a<00:01:07.490> SWAT<00:01:07.850> and<00:01:08.180> what<00:01:08.840> you

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
make an attempt or a SWAT and what you

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.090 
make an attempt or a SWAT and what you
shouldn't<00:01:09.200> be<00:01:09.320> swatting<00:01:09.740> but<00:01:09.890> if<00:01:09.980> you're

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
shouldn't be swatting but if you're

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.100 
shouldn't be swatting but if you're
going<00:01:10.250> up<00:01:10.340> to<00:01:10.430> make<00:01:10.610> a<00:01:10.640> SWAT<00:01:11.030> those<00:01:11.840> are<00:01:11.990> going

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
going up to make a SWAT those are going

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:12.700 
going up to make a SWAT those are going
to<00:01:12.170> get<00:01:12.290> in<00:01:12.410> your<00:01:12.530> way

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
to get in your way

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.470 
to get in your way
so<00:01:13.070> I<00:01:13.100> already<00:01:13.280> know<00:01:13.580> that<00:01:13.610> i<00:01:13.850> can<00:01:14.000> jump<00:01:14.330> at

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:14.480 
so I already know that i can jump at

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.990 
so I already know that i can jump at
least<00:01:14.690> 10<00:01:14.900> feet<00:01:14.930> so<00:01:15.740> I<00:01:15.800> left<00:01:16.010> one<00:01:16.280> black<00:01:16.550> just

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
least 10 feet so I left one black just

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.910 
least 10 feet so I left one black just
showing<00:01:17.300> that<00:01:17.360> anything<00:01:17.900> above<00:01:17.990> that<00:01:18.410> would

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
showing that anything above that would

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.330 
showing that anything above that would
be<00:01:19.070> over<00:01:19.400> 10<00:01:19.640> feet<00:01:19.990> ready<00:01:20.990> yeah<00:01:21.409> all<00:01:21.920> right<00:01:22.130> now

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
be over 10 feet ready yeah all right now

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.219 
be over 10 feet ready yeah all right now
that<00:01:22.970> we've<00:01:23.150> already<00:01:23.360> established<00:01:23.630> the<00:01:23.960> fact

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
that we've already established the fact

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.289 
that we've already established the fact
that<00:01:24.320> my<00:01:24.500> standard<00:01:24.890> reach<00:01:25.040> is<00:01:25.280> 7<00:01:25.850> foot<00:01:26.060> 9

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
that my standard reach is 7 foot 9

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:28.210 
that my standard reach is 7 foot 9
inches<00:01:26.570> we<00:01:27.350> know<00:01:27.500> that<00:01:27.680> it's<00:01:27.799> going<00:01:27.920> to<00:01:28.040> take

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
inches we know that it's going to take

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.330 
inches we know that it's going to take
27<00:01:29.000> inches<00:01:29.360> to<00:01:29.570> touch<00:01:30.140> 10<00:01:30.439> feet<00:01:30.740> and<00:01:30.920> 10<00:01:31.310> feet

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
27 inches to touch 10 feet and 10 feet

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.179 
27 inches to touch 10 feet and 10 feet
being<00:01:31.820> the<00:01:32.180> the<00:01:32.659> benchmark<00:01:33.500> due<00:01:33.710> to<00:01:33.860> the<00:01:33.950> fact

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:34.189 
being the the benchmark due to the fact

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:36.550 
being the the benchmark due to the fact
that<00:01:34.310> most<00:01:34.610> of<00:01:34.759> us<00:01:34.850> jump<00:01:35.240> to<00:01:35.420> try<00:01:35.630> to<00:01:35.689> dunk<00:01:36.020> so

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
that most of us jump to try to dunk so

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.359 
that most of us jump to try to dunk so
if<00:01:36.770> once<00:01:37.040> I<00:01:37.189> touch<00:01:37.430> the<00:01:37.610> first<00:01:37.909> peg<00:01:38.240> on<00:01:38.810> the

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369 
if once I touch the first peg on the

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:41.679 
if once I touch the first peg on the
vertical<00:01:40.369> leap<00:01:40.520> tester<00:01:40.939> we<00:01:41.090> know<00:01:41.299> that<00:01:41.509> if<00:01:41.600> I

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:41.689 
vertical leap tester we know that if I

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:44.620 
vertical leap tester we know that if I
established<00:01:42.590> at<00:01:42.770> least<00:01:43.009> 27<00:01:43.909> inches<00:01:44.240> towards

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
established at least 27 inches towards

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.780 
established at least 27 inches towards
my<00:01:44.750> vertical<00:01:45.229> leap<00:01:45.380> so<00:01:45.950> right<00:01:46.219> now<00:01:46.369> I'm<00:01:46.490> going

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
my vertical leap so right now I'm going

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.069 
my vertical leap so right now I'm going
to<00:01:46.850> jump<00:01:47.000> a<00:01:47.090> little<00:01:47.240> light<00:01:47.479> so<00:01:47.840> these<00:01:47.960> are

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:48.079 
to jump a little light so these are

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:49.359 
to jump a little light so these are
going<00:01:48.170> to<00:01:48.229> be<00:01:48.320> a<00:01:48.350> couple<00:01:48.560> of<00:01:48.770> warmups<00:01:49.040> so<00:01:49.280> you

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
going to be a couple of warmups so you

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:50.800 
going to be a couple of warmups so you
guys<00:01:49.520> can<00:01:49.759> see<00:01:49.909> exactly<00:01:50.240> what<00:01:50.450> I'm<00:01:50.540> talking

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
guys can see exactly what I'm talking

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:51.100 
guys can see exactly what I'm talking
about

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
about

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.740 
about
ready<00:01:51.590> all<00:01:52.189> right<00:01:52.399> every<00:01:53.149> vertical<00:01:53.600> leap

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
ready all right every vertical leap

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.590 
ready all right every vertical leap
tester<00:01:54.200> has<00:01:54.710> a<00:01:55.040> way<00:01:55.340> the<00:01:55.549> peg<00:01:55.790> swing<00:01:56.240> they

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
tester has a way the peg swing they

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.929 
tester has a way the peg swing they
either<00:01:56.869> swing<00:01:57.170> going<00:01:57.920> forward<00:01:58.460> or<00:01:58.610> going

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
either swing going forward or going

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:00.609 
either swing going forward or going
backwards<00:01:59.210> depending<00:01:59.570> on<00:01:59.960> which<00:02:00.140> side<00:02:00.380> you're

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
backwards depending on which side you're

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:02.620 
backwards depending on which side you're
standing<00:02:01.039> on<00:02:01.159> so<00:02:01.700> when<00:02:01.939> you<00:02:02.060> do<00:02:02.210> your<00:02:02.390> reach

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
standing on so when you do your reach

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.109 
standing on so when you do your reach
test<00:02:03.049> make<00:02:03.439> sure<00:02:03.649> it's<00:02:03.890> on<00:02:03.950> the<00:02:04.070> same<00:02:04.310> side<00:02:04.729> as

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
test make sure it's on the same side as

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:06.850 
test make sure it's on the same side as
the<00:02:05.450> side<00:02:05.810> you're<00:02:06.020> going<00:02:06.140> to<00:02:06.200> be<00:02:06.259> jumping<00:02:06.590> on

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
the side you're going to be jumping on

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:07.870 
the side you're going to be jumping on
because<00:02:07.130> if<00:02:07.280> not<00:02:07.460> you're<00:02:07.670> going<00:02:07.759> to<00:02:07.820> be

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
because if not you're going to be

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.999 
because if not you're going to be
reaching<00:02:08.060> across<00:02:08.570> your<00:02:08.840> body<00:02:09.050> which<00:02:09.770> means

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
reaching across your body which means

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.160 
reaching across your body which means
you'll<00:02:10.160> be<00:02:10.250> losing<00:02:10.460> height<00:02:10.850> so<00:02:11.420> if<00:02:11.600> if<00:02:11.840> you

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
you'll be losing height so if if you

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.620 
you'll be losing height so if if you
jump<00:02:12.680> with<00:02:12.950> your<00:02:13.220> right<00:02:13.490> hand<00:02:13.760> you<00:02:14.360> want<00:02:14.540> to

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
jump with your right hand you want to

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.700 
jump with your right hand you want to
make<00:02:14.750> sure<00:02:14.780> it's<00:02:15.410> on<00:02:15.800> the<00:02:16.370> right<00:02:16.640> side<00:02:17.270> of<00:02:17.450> you

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
make sure it's on the right side of you

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.740 
make sure it's on the right side of you
or<00:02:18.710> if<00:02:19.370> you<00:02:19.550> jump<00:02:19.790> with<00:02:19.880> your<00:02:20.000> left<00:02:20.240> hand<00:02:20.450> it's

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
or if you jump with your left hand it's

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.660 
or if you jump with your left hand it's
on<00:02:21.140> the<00:02:21.260> left<00:02:21.500> side<00:02:21.590> of<00:02:21.890> you<00:02:22.010> so<00:02:22.160> that<00:02:22.460> way<00:02:22.610> you

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
on the left side of you so that way you

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.610 
on the left side of you so that way you
don't<00:02:22.940> get<00:02:23.060> shorted<00:02:23.510> out<00:02:23.629> of<00:02:23.810> any<00:02:23.989> inches<00:02:24.440> when

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
don't get shorted out of any inches when

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.190 
don't get shorted out of any inches when
you<00:02:24.709> do<00:02:24.860> your<00:02:25.010> vertical<00:02:25.400> leap<00:02:25.430> test<00:02:25.989> all<00:02:26.989> right

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
you do your vertical leap test all right

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.870 
you do your vertical leap test all right
that<00:02:27.470> was<00:02:27.590> my<00:02:27.709> warm-up<00:02:28.129> jump<00:02:28.430> so

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
that was my warm-up jump so

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.700 
that was my warm-up jump so
I hit<00:02:29.060> a<00:02:29.090> couple<00:02:29.420> of<00:02:29.510> the<00:02:29.660> prongs<00:02:30.140> I'm<00:02:30.230> not

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
I hit a couple of the prongs I'm not

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.080 
I hit a couple of the prongs I'm not
going<00:02:30.890> to<00:02:30.950> reset<00:02:31.280> it<00:02:31.400> due<00:02:31.580> to<00:02:31.700> the<00:02:31.790> fact<00:02:32.000> that

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
going to reset it due to the fact that

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.850 
going to reset it due to the fact that
those<00:02:32.390> were<00:02:32.450> just<00:02:32.750> getting<00:02:33.020> away<00:02:33.110> that<00:02:33.710> was<00:02:33.830> a

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
those were just getting away that was a

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.170 
those were just getting away that was a
warm-up<00:02:34.130> so<00:02:34.370> I<00:02:34.400> should<00:02:34.730> be<00:02:34.880> able<00:02:35.000> to<00:02:35.060> go<00:02:35.120> a

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
warm-up so I should be able to go a

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.850 
warm-up so I should be able to go a
little<00:02:35.360> bit<00:02:35.540> higher<00:02:35.750> so<00:02:36.020> make<00:02:36.470> sure<00:02:36.590> you<00:02:36.710> do

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
little bit higher so make sure you do

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.560 
little bit higher so make sure you do
that<00:02:37.010> after<00:02:37.190> you<00:02:37.460> clear<00:02:37.880> a<00:02:37.910> height<00:02:38.180> that<00:02:38.420> you

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
that after you clear a height that you

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:39.640 
that after you clear a height that you
know<00:02:38.720> you<00:02:38.780> can<00:02:38.990> go<00:02:39.110> a<00:02:39.140> little<00:02:39.320> bit<00:02:39.470> higher

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
know you can go a little bit higher

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.440 
know you can go a little bit higher
clear<00:02:39.980> those<00:02:40.190> out<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:40.550> way<00:02:40.700> so<00:02:40.940> where<00:02:41.360> it

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
clear those out the way so where it

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:42.910 
clear those out the way so where it
makes<00:02:41.630> it<00:02:41.750> easier<00:02:42.170> for<00:02:42.410> you<00:02:42.500> to<00:02:42.530> go<00:02:42.710> up<00:02:42.800> and

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
makes it easier for you to go up and
