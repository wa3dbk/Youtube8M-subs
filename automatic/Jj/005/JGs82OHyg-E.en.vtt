00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.900
 so walk welcome back and now 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.849
 it's about the topic of six pack genetics 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.039
 This word genetics is always very much 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.189
 pretty often used 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:22.609
 and yes I wanted to have such parks 12 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:26.250
 small thing because in this regard mention 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:27.980
 Everyone can have their first sixpack 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.720
 So every human has a sixpack and 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.610
 of course the genetics here determines whether 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.260
 the one sixpack or 1 11 becker her 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.670
 can not you somehow 1 or 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.290
 train with others in which other 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.340
 Exercises either say you have of 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:45.329
 nature of eight or nature of 6 das 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:48.329
 it was then there are people who have 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.860
 I'm genetically speaking now 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.390
 because I know I'm not 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.890
 sure if that's really genetic and 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.170
 which could somehow change 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.550
 theoretically but hormonal 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.960
 There are also water deposits 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.059
 people for example i think so 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.680
 Also belong to a bit like that 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.470
 even at very low body fat 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.350
 that's less than ten percent 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.909
 where you still the sixpack in the willicher 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.390
 finally from strained 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.040
 State 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.540
 not so good you would have to see 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.210
 slightly tense it just more 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.689
 stands out and for it of course 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.880
 very hard to get a sixpack and 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.299
 or that 's what it's all about 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.590
 to hold without somehow dehydrate 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.570
 and so on 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.430
 Unfortunately you have to live with it somehow 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.990
 the other thing is and that is 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.549
 certainly a bit genetic too 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.939
 is determined 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:38.009
 the scope of the part that is so at 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.049
 Of course, everyone sees the sixpack differently 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.630
 because we are all individual 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.860
 that means when sometimes in you 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.860
 which videos of him which ones 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.990
 supertollen fitness model types look 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.790
 yes and yes you are such a brutal classics 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.439
 but find cool slender part 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.270
 and they do some exercises and 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.280
 say yes, that's what it does in it then 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.990
 very important not to think about it okay if 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.610
 Do this exercise that I mean 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.280
 sixpack at some point like that no 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.299
 it will not be because your genetics 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.579
 or you are you 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.520
 abdominal circumference of abdomen and waist 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:10.020
 so to speak is individual and no matter how 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.679
 a lot of body fat which will decrease if 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.780
 for example 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.299
 the broad parts then you will 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.069
 never such a very brutal close 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:18.599
 narrow parts get as they are 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.819
 others simply by nature 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.530
 that is unfortunately so that you can 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:27.510
 not even with any exercises 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:30.299
 or anything else needs to change 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.739
 Unfortunately, you accept it as well 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:33.510
 the belly of one is or like that 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:36.150
 sixpack at the end sometime looks like 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.189
 after years of training and with it 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.500
 just get along and at the end must 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:42.180
 finally the most important thing is the best one 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.500
 So always turn it off and think okay 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.419
 I do not want that one 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.159
 It looks the same somehow because it's world 

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:49.549
 he never we are always 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:52.859
 individually his new single always becomes 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:54.209
 be as it is normal and not that 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:56.579
 from the other you just there 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:59.340
 somehow watch and always try 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:00.620
 a better version of yourself too 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.379
 create 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:06.389
 yes, that's a topic that we are so 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:08.579
 bit smaller guide have so 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:12.719
 Regarding okay, that's genetics now 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:15.690
 is training now so be aware 

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:17.400
 with what you've been trying so always 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.409
 make best of it or 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.180
 to become the best version of you 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:22.590
 today i have that is expect next 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.940
 year, there is still a better sixpack 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.650
 and so on and so on, of course 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.290
 as I muscle building and I 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.689
 Of course not going to get so fat 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:33.930
 and in the end, they all look good 

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:36.260
 It looked and that was up to me 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.260
 soon
