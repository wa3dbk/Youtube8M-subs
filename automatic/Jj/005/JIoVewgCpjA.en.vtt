00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:09.150
 Hello, I 'm Simon 's muscle maker 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.610
 Today we cook together with Sarah 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.259
 would have fitness rapeseed in and of itself 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.580
 are not very sport fair 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.890
 are just not healthy is too much 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.420
 greasy the fedstückchen between the 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.789
 sticking teeth and the taste in sauces 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.230
 then of course athletes is a thing 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.910
 which you do not eat as well as really 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.740
 Nevertheless we should have thought 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.000
 they are just as tasty as we wraps 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.769
 on the bock on it and tomorrow someone the 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.420
 whole, let's just cook it again 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.099
 in healthy you already have a lot 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.350
 Prepared ingredients as you can see 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.450
 some fresh but also 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.610
 very important this brown relative 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.780
 looks unsightly chunks here 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.730
 really not much nicer 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.090
 could be anything but a one 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.710
 super substitute for mincemeat yes what 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.090
 stuck in all the brown lumps of rill 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.850
 maybe you can do it the same way 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.129
 beforehand betrayed this is the child 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.890
 This is called tofu chopped 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.149
 I know many are asking call calls 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.420
 have to set badly against 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:03.030
 but I say you are spiced correctly 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.430
 especially delicious had to do this 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.150

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.350

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.420

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:35.640
 mission take the rosemary thyme

 and the thing is done all right 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:46.170
 I swing behind the camera and 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:55.290
 sarah subscribes that means I enter 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:58.290

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:06.870

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:11.090
 ever the coupe-like on 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:21.230
 that's the way it looks right now, of course 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:28.590
 she does look a little bit weird, though 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:34.790
 Very first look in the camera 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:34.790
 so the onions know garlic glassy 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:09.709

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:19.160
 put that they had never met out 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.640
 and if the clubhouse 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:55.010
 throughout the andré does not make 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:56.659
