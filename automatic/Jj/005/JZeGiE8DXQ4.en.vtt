00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.020 
rollergirls just how did the roller
derby<00:02:35.780> become<00:02:36.500> such<00:02:36.830> a<00:02:36.860> major<00:02:37.280> part<00:02:37.640> in<00:02:37.850> their

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
derby become such a major part in their

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.680 
derby become such a major part in their
lives<00:02:38.270> I<00:02:39.670> think<00:02:40.670> people<00:02:40.820> can<00:02:41.060> get<00:02:41.180> obsessed<00:02:41.540> by

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
lives I think people can get obsessed by

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.300 
lives I think people can get obsessed by
lots<00:02:41.930> of<00:02:42.020> things<00:02:42.260> include<00:02:42.650> like<00:02:42.950> lots<00:02:43.250> of

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
lots of things include like lots of

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.100 
lots of things include like lots of
different<00:02:43.640> sports<00:02:43.820> so<00:02:44.600> I<00:02:44.630> think<00:02:44.690> it's<00:02:44.930> just

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
different sports so I think it's just

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.700 
different sports so I think it's just
finding<00:02:45.320> one<00:02:45.560> that<00:02:45.590> you<00:02:45.860> particularly<00:02:46.310> enjoy

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:47.710 
finding one that you particularly enjoy

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:51.510 
finding one that you particularly enjoy
and<00:02:48.280> pretty<00:02:48.910> much<00:02:49.000> everybody<00:02:49.650> I<00:02:50.650> used<00:02:51.280> to<00:02:51.370> go

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
and pretty much everybody I used to go

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.030 
and pretty much everybody I used to go
to<00:02:51.580> circus<00:02:51.940> classes<00:02:52.780> to<00:02:53.050> trapeze<00:02:53.410> and

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
to circus classes to trapeze and

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.580 
to circus classes to trapeze and
somebody<00:02:54.490> they<00:02:54.700> told<00:02:55.120> me<00:02:55.300> about<00:02:55.450> it<00:02:55.930> but<00:02:56.500> I

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
somebody they told me about it but I

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.800 
somebody they told me about it but I
thought<00:02:56.890> oh<00:02:57.130> that<00:02:57.640> sounds<00:02:57.970> a<00:02:58.030> bit<00:02:58.120> dangerous<00:02:58.330> I

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
thought oh that sounds a bit dangerous I

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.960 
thought oh that sounds a bit dangerous I
don't<00:02:58.990> think<00:02:59.110> I'd<00:02:59.200> be<00:02:59.320> very<00:02:59.350> good<00:02:59.590> at<00:02:59.980> it<00:03:00.010> but

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
don't think I'd be very good at it but

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.130 
don't think I'd be very good at it but
then<00:03:01.180> the<00:03:01.330> more<00:03:01.480> I<00:03:01.540> thought<00:03:01.750> about<00:03:01.810> it<00:03:02.020> I

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
then the more I thought about it I

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.020
