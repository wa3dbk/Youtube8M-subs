00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 let's say that foundress welcome back to 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.779
 pokémon ruins omega in this part 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.849
 we are once again cycling to love this 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.980
 it will be the third time we see each other 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.130
 once for the adventure once for 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.890
 spirit and at the third time to capture 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.480
 obviously a legendary you all know 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.439
 how many of whom am I talking about? 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.779
 of or that is not a laugh but the name 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.570
 of the January makes papa that nice that 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.900
 are and if there are a couple of differences 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.759
 between ruby 9 that really is the first alpha 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.550
 that the rubin omega can be taken o 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.989
 while in sapphire to falluja 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.450
 so you can't have both a 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.829
 unless it came to exchange and the 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.809
 second difference is that despite 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.260
 They are both at sea cycle 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.329
 the first one can be captured by going to 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.320
 this part the second can be captured 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.180
 instead in the depths of the sea cycle 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.730
 so doing suv as it should be 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.980
 given that even in the original games or yes 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.390
 located at the top of a tower e 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.400
 luca is at the bottom in the depths 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:08.070
 of the right ocean is island I go out sea 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.040
 yes therefore we will have to go on this 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.590
 there is a mysterious metal arm 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.790
 fluctuating ring mid air is felt 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.850
 a mysterious presence within it 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:21.420
 then take a closer look 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:23.570
 no wait let me save the game 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.570
 before 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:28.430
 ok now yes 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:43.320
 ladies and gentlemen legendary encounter 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:44.550
 today's level 50 rightly and me 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.530
 I would say to leave immediately with a beautiful one 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:51.680
 oxbow I want to try I want to try 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.680
 I don't take velox ball so much 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.330
 and in fact we try to capture it 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:04.110
 normally 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:06.890
 ahia ahia or I was also burned 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.890
 fantastic 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.670
 let's see if I can overcome it with care 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:15.270
 I can't do the burn very well 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:19.440
 we immediately change pokémon then 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:21.210
 who can we send against someone who 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.340
 I don't hurt too much 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.620
 could be bright obviously not 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.020
 with lightning but with the moves that 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.790
 unfortunately still and that is enough 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:35.030
 weak he knows quick attack and 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:38.580
 bite then exploit them Koranic 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.080
 if I do them very little I would say that 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.820
 for an advanced mega I could do you some 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:46.130
 more than slightly but not damage 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:52.020
 too, however, I try so no bag 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:54.000
 fight mega evolution towards by anyway 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:57.020
 cheat the evolution friend here in a 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.020
 mega how to get out of it 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:05.129
 ok let's see how much i can do with a 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.540
 bite by mega wanted bullying them 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:10.800
 I make the attack speak for how much 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:12.330
 I can serve morse 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:18.540
 slightly more, however, he hesitated 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:25.500
 that cool yet great March has 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:28.470
 again wavering again 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:31.700
 floor plan punishment ok 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:35.130
 I'd say he lost enough energy 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:37.650
 maybe quick attack 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:40.230
 no i don't want to risk poké ball bag 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:43.860
 and let's start with the ultra vol 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:46.549
 I am 51 after meeting with the trams 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:49.879
 that made me waste more than 40 1 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:53.099
 and it seemed to you 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:55.319
 now I have 50 precise ones, do not see me 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:57.810
 waste all please note that it does 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:59.489
 also the Japanese sign own the 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:10.440
 in case you should call it gowns 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:11.730
 just go go all trouble one want 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.510
 make me all these by sea 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:19.229
 legendary ok bright greets us no again 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:21.810
 no by the bright from that maybe I can to 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:26.160
 save if it gets into this ultra bubble 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:28.919
 tell me that not even a turn comes 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:38.010
 punishment hello hello bright thanks you are me 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:40.860
 it was very useful though but the music was 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:45.590
 background music guys that is beautiful 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.590
 is how beautiful is the background music 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.850
 bag in addition to valdaj 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:58.220
 your beautiful music but I have to 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:04.360
 absolutely catch you because i have gods 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:04.360
 video to upload one and it seemed to you 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.530
 among other things, I first take these off 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.330
 legendary that you can meet in 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:13.220
 specific points the better 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.570
 he is the last of the other gods 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.700
 legendary that you can meet in 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:20.570
 specific points the others are 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:21.680
 I do not know how many Paul I do not know 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.450
 I don't remember that I had contacts 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.420
 I forgot the others you can 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:29.650
 keep everyone with the hyper flight 

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:33.860
 discovering their points that I am kind 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:36.230
 virgin forest cave unknown le 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:42.020
 slits those of some algae 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:44.450
 Latin or similar stuff and I don't know how many 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.950
 legendary remained I could do a 

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:50.480
 quick mental calculation 

00:05:45.950 --> 00:06:02.120
 could i expect one has anyway i am 

00:05:50.480 --> 00:06:06.220
 remained 3 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:13.220
 I said well I said it well 16 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:14.900
 more obviously one two three plus three 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:17.090
 legendary that you can only have 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:19.610
 in the other version is that I obviously 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:21.620
 don't catch rho so they won't be 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:23.660
 obviously all of them for a part 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:26.990
 so I won't load another 16 parts later 

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:31.040
 this for example puxi but we are waiting for if 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:33.860
 face them and pay attention 3 ho 

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:35.660
 got caught that nice without cuts and 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.460
 no cuts, however, as they are saying 

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:40.100
 last roughness if i should take them in 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:44.420
 a single part as well as and to his with 

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:47.120
 el rifle as well as returned if land horus 

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:49.100
 lanus as well as I should do also of 

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.990
 emiratina seaweed maybe even to whom 

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:54.230
 I do, however, separate them from them 

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:55.970
 I will do stellan together I will do 

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:57.000
 together obviously terraglione appear 

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:59.340
 division 

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.470
 I should do cures and marracino by myself 

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:08.640
 necessary therefore counting rapidly 

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:12.480
 they would still be 123456789 parts there 

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:13.950
 they should be eye to eye 9 

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.090
 first jolie or shines in seven colors a 

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:16.350

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:17.820
 bright it is said that his tvs that 

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:23.010
 leaving happiness to those who own them

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:31.169
 part ends here thanks for 

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:32.490
