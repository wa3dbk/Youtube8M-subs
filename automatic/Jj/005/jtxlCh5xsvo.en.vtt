00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.559
 following the tip of the friend Marcos cross 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:17.310
 so let's show the face then iraq 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:21.449
 for the light to appear well the face I am 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:24.869
 zeca zé k origin 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:30.230
 I live in brasópolis in the south of minas 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:34.230
 and today I'm going to present the hint of how 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:40.460
 model the cam since in my city I 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:44.239
 I do not have a company that sells pipe 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.239
 rectangular or square 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:55.579
 at first what I have for 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:55.579
 to present this here are two boards 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:06.990
 in the width of five 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:09.659
 the length 33 is here by chance that 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.700
 non-compliance varies according to the 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.700
 size of everything you will use 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:24.590
 making an external measurement tube of 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.590
 100 32 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.560
 taking these two 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:36.780
 understanding that it has this difference 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.740
 wall then 30 would be the space 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.540
 on here 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:45.360
 if it were open it would give 30 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:51.360
 so I have to work with limit 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:57.329
 of 30 what I did five of this side but 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:02:00.090
 5 on this side take 10 plus 10 here 20 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.469
 10 more from here 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:06.149
 so I came to this conclusion 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:10.080
 you already after the 2 raffle the serve 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:14.480
 5 I found the position of 10 and then I 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:18.180
 I found the size of this other internal 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.900
 This internal support here has a 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:25.980
 hinge on one side and the other on the other 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.940
 as down as well with this I can 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.600
 do 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:34.160
 this movement 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:37.430
 Why do I need this time to? 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:43.120
 fit it here I could not have 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:44.630
 something like that and from here 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.620
 heating 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.620
 I'll arrive 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:40.040
 I'm sure if you do it here 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:44.420
 in the stove oven and have the 

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:48.950
 be careful when he starts to 

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:52.630
 lose shape to fit the modeler 

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:58.850
 inside it will be possible to do 

00:06:52.630 --> 00:07:02.720
 maybe much faster than 

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:06.950
 frankly I prefer here that is where I 

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:11.870
 I have more control 

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:14.660
 I'll bring in the time that I want 

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:16.460
 Of course, if it is a very 

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:21.710
 great 

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:24.980
 ideal is to take pro forma 

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:27.980
 that's it then 

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:27.980
 wonderful 

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:33.500
 to the next
