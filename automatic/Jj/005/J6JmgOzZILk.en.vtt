tokens extractor I already have it right
here

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
here

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.780 
here
token<00:01:18.450> extractor<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.430> pretty<00:01:20.430> much<00:01:20.549> this

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
token extractor and pretty much this

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.300 
token extractor and pretty much this
brings<00:01:21.090> up<00:01:21.330> all<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.900> apps<00:01:22.200> that<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:22.740> have<00:01:22.770> and

all the apps that are able to be cracked

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.870 
all the apps that are able to be cracked
so<00:01:27.540> here's<00:01:28.350> YouTube<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:29.100> YouTube<00:01:29.400> plus<00:01:29.640> app

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
so here's YouTube the YouTube plus app

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.370 
so here's YouTube the YouTube plus app
and<00:01:30.150> as<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.540> can<00:01:30.659> see<00:01:30.810> I<00:01:30.840> have<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.079> option<00:01:31.350> to

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.140 
and as you can see I have the option to
crack<00:01:31.650> it<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.070> if<00:01:32.189> I<00:01:32.280> go<00:01:32.400> on<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.579> full<00:01:32.759> app<00:01:32.939> I

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
crack it and if I go on a full app I

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.780 
crack it and if I go on a full app I
don't<00:01:33.390> have<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.630> option<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:33.960> crack<00:01:34.290> it<00:01:34.790> so

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
don't have the option to crack it so

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.780 
don't have the option to crack it so
let's<00:01:36.659> let's<00:01:37.229> crack<00:01:37.439> it<00:01:37.619> so<00:01:38.189> you<00:01:38.250> just<00:01:38.520> do<00:01:38.640> that

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
let's let's crack it so you just do that

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.210 
let's let's crack it so you just do that
and<00:01:38.970> as<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:39.450> can<00:01:39.540> see<00:01:39.810> very<00:01:39.990> simple<00:01:40.770> now<00:01:41.070> it's

and as you can see very simple now it's

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.530 
and as you can see very simple now it's
cracked<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:43.189> now<00:01:44.189> we<00:01:44.250> go<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.610> app<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:45.060> as

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
cracked and now we go to the app and as

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.760 
cracked and now we go to the app and as
you<00:01:45.600> can<00:01:45.689> see<00:01:45.869> it's<00:01:45.990> still<00:01:46.170> there<00:01:46.350> all<00:01:46.530> you

you can see it's still there all you

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.069 
you can see it's still there all you
gotta<00:01:46.920> do<00:01:47.040> is<00:01:47.070> restart<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.729> app<00:01:47.820> so<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.509> do

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
gotta do is restart the app so to do

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.670 
gotta do is restart the app so to do
that<00:01:49.220> you<00:01:50.220> open<00:01:50.430> up<00:01:50.490> your<00:01:50.640> tax<00:01:50.880> manager<00:01:51.329> and
