00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.200
 I'll teach you to make a guris door. 

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.190
 you will do 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.659
 a current with 45 

00:00:08.659 --> 00:00:11.759
 or 45 chains 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.289
 this will give around 19 to 20 centimeters 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.420
 this will depend on the thickness of the thread and the needle 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.119
 I'm using that number 13 that the war had won. 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.029
 they were also injured 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:31.509
 made 45 occurrences 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:33.530
 you will do 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.820
 two chains to climb 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.650
 it is a good idea to insert a needle into the third chain and 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.350
 punctual 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.920
 early 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.180
 next chain 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.230
 half point arch 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.940
 Are you going to work on the current scoreboard? 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.940
 half high point 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.340
 he is staying like this 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.830
 next chain 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.140
 half point to point 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.070
 Are you going to work like this? 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.070
 it was more or less 30 centimeters 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.680
 it will stay a rectangle 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.890
 this point it is better to work than low 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.620
 thankfully more 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.030
 the number of careers you will be doing when you have worked 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.040
 in a low 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.830
 it is the result of robbery 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.620
 from the most 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.420
 now let's go back 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.340
 two families 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.590
 guides over the two 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.120
 to do 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.640
 punctual medium 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.710
 picking up no interest from the post office at the top of the previous bridge 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:02.120
 against this your baby build a rectangle of but at least 19 by 30 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.970
 They treated the right size so we're waiting. 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.139
 a huge amount of goias 

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:11.569
 needed 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.099
 then we who do process 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.099
 usually we have more than to use more 

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:21.679
 It's interesting to always get together. 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:26.799
 he will stay like this 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:30.260
 now let's start a peak that we will involve our 

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:35.589
 You're going to make three chains chase. 

00:02:36.179 --> 00:02:39.179
 and will do 

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:43.039
 the two points used 

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:46.139
 will then be in a pad with three points added 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:54.829
 you will jump two points of the city will deliver in third 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:59.129
 and will do then 

00:02:59.839 --> 00:03:02.839
 plus three points in the account 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:06.929
 a high point for each 

00:03:06.929 --> 00:03:09.109
 two chains 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:12.230
 was two points and taking third 

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:16.139
 if it was then 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:19.139
 three high points 

00:03:24.779 --> 00:03:28.079
 historians of life said 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:31.079
 a third party 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:39.939
 do this until the end to signal we will end also with three 

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:41.139
 high points like 

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:42.329
 even so 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:45.379
 I'm coming to an end. 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:48.379
 finalize with a 

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:59.009
 uncertainty 

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:04.209
 now we're going to walk with us, we'll go 

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:09.869
 or is he going to stay 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:12.889
 You'll get him. 

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:16.109
 and to get lost 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.109
 at the next point 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.079
 introduces the woman within the occurrences 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:29.979
 and let's start working only in spaces 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:33.539
 three points ago 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.809
 two chains larsen b 

00:04:37.809 --> 00:04:40.809
 already next month 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:51.659
 Dora is fine. 

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:53.719
 at the next stage 

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:55.590
 Similarly 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.180
 do it until the end of the season
