00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 hello friends of the movie welcome to 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.640
 DVD review with a new trailer check 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.440
 and stephenie meyers may be after 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.300
 the trailer three great success 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.280
 because she is nothing less than that 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.870
 author of these books have been very pleased 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.179
 but of course now more books 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.830
 written and concord still has desire 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.300
 to film one of these others and 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.800
 to bring this year into the cinema with it 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.789
 it's about my trainer jack today 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.789
 choose 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:36.210
 that is impossible 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:37.500
 you are a human my name is jÃ¶rg 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.120
 I have been with for two years 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:45.199
 No one else spoke that 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.199
 is the beginning of a love story 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:52.070
 nothing unusual 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.690
 apart from a fact we 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.980
 are in the future the 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.980
 Humanity is as good as extinct 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.670
 invaded by another species, the 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.730
 our 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.570
 deletes to use our bodies 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.980
 I do not see any of us yet 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.550
 knocked back 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.550
 strike her 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.820
 came with customer 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:27.020
 Almost all bones are broken like 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.020
 cracked 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:36.850
 here absolutely wants to human 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.650
 you have to get used to the body first 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.110
 they are not like the other league 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.900
 So far your emotions have been used 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.120
 strong if your will along with yours 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:49.650
 you have survived memories 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.650
 inner resistance afford 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.650
 this is not a human 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.850
 if we stop the people to help 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:11.870
 I miss everything about her I do everything around 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:16.420
 to get her back 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.420
 I have to get it that's even more 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.900
 yes for all who might like twilight 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.220
 that maybe the right page 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.100
 but I already hear many of you 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.950
 oh my god please do not say something like that in 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.530
 2013 have many end time movies like after 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.000
 work like oblivion world or lombardis 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.410
 many interesting ones in the direction 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.690
 zombie or something developing and 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.220
 Here comes a new one at some point in 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.660
 In the future, the earth has been overrun 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.240
 were from so-called see each other 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.730
 how parasites nest in people and 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.230
 their internal take over only there is still 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.850
 few people hunted during 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.710
 one of them survives that mandy the 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.900
 even then captured sometime 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.100
 but she has the ability 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.840
 your body is not a series too 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.050
 let alone inner struggle with 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.150
 to run another room and thus 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.950
 there is such a kind of hybrid here 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.110
 afterwards exists in this future 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.610
 world only the best of the most naturally 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.440
 also not find the love story 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.870
 Melanies in love with a young man 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.980
 and this couple is just due 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.480
 that you are being captured 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.470
 separated and the whole film extends 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.720
 Then I believe that you are yourself 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.640
 finds again and in this this 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.530
 dangerous scenario survives yes 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.720
 somehow that reminds me everything 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.610
 also again share the extraordinary 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.530
 figures as something fantastic everything 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.480
 something supernatural to one 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.040
 love story in the heart of the film 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.510
 that's why I'm curious what the 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.830
 I'm so allowed to bring a movie 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.510
 a bit skeptical but suspect that 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.090
 at least for my taste and that 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.160
 to be more pleasant to the normal cinemagoer 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.330
 may be as twilight as bin 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.890
 but also do not think that it 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.240
 Now I'll find a giant man 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.100
 a trailer see the effects already 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.810
 again not so good except for that 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.489
 that here you are all human figures 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.020
 almost this contact lens uses the 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.940
 because so these lakes should lure 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.110
 I'm curious to be honest 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.970
 Not so much to see the movie 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.230
 a more precise start date has concorde 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.250
 not yet given out that he 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.660
 at least to the press 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.190
 that's why i can give you this first 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:12.720
 I am always withheld from your opinion 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:13.860
 curious about this trailer and I have 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.300
 First of me he returns with mine 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.100
 Opinion as we would like to see later 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.320
 not too much and trumpet and afterwards 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.760
 completely wrong without me 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.680
 for today and tomorrow 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.000
 Of course, a new review at 15 o'clock and 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.300
 a trailer check and until then it's done 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.770
 Well 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.770
 see you soon and bye
