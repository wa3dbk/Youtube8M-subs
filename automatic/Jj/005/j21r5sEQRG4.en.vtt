machine<00:06:01.600> is<00:06:01.720> about<00:06:01.840> fifteen<00:06:02.470> thousand

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:03.160 
machine is about fifteen thousand

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.830 
machine is about fifteen thousand
dollars<00:06:03.520> and<00:06:03.729> I'm<00:06:03.850> just<00:06:04.030> gonna<00:06:04.180> take<00:06:04.479> a<00:06:04.510> guess

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:04.840 
dollars and I'm just gonna take a guess

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:06.970 
but I would say that it's probably

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:08.610 
but I would say that it's probably
something<00:06:07.300> about<00:06:07.600> that<00:06:07.810> machine<00:06:08.229> that<00:06:08.440> makes

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:08.620 
something about that machine that makes

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:10.950 
something about that machine that makes
the<00:06:08.800> espresso<00:06:09.310> just<00:06:09.640> right<00:06:09.940> well<00:06:10.570> let's<00:06:10.780> say

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960 
the espresso just right well let's say

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.530 
the espresso just right well let's say
that<00:06:11.260> it's<00:06:11.860> the<00:06:12.490> calibration<00:06:13.060> of<00:06:13.090> the<00:06:13.180> machine

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:13.540 
that it's the calibration of the machine

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.600 
that it's the calibration of the machine
is<00:06:13.660> really<00:06:13.900> important<00:06:14.290> and<00:06:14.410> and<00:06:15.040> this<00:06:15.190> machine

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:15.610 
is really important and and this machine

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:18.090 
is really important and and this machine
can<00:06:15.820> be<00:06:15.970> automatic<00:06:16.450> could<00:06:16.600> be<00:06:16.860> manually<00:06:17.860> used

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:18.100 
can be automatic could be manually used

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:21.120 
can be automatic could be manually used
one<00:06:18.340> and<00:06:18.550> they<00:06:19.060> work<00:06:19.840> with<00:06:20.050> it<00:06:20.200> in<00:06:21.070> a

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:21.130 
one and they work with it in a

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:23.400 
one and they work with it in a
semi-automatic<00:06:21.970> way<00:06:22.300> so<00:06:22.810> they<00:06:22.960> can<00:06:23.140> get<00:06:23.260> the

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:23.410 
semi-automatic way so they can get the
