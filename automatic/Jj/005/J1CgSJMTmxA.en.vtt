00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
and so I would turn the bench on a

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.170 
and so I would turn the bench on a
diagonal<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.500> then<00:00:47.129> lay<00:00:47.370> down<00:00:47.399> on<00:00:47.820> it<00:00:48.030> I'm

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
diagonal and then lay down on it I'm

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.869 
diagonal and then lay down on it I'm
about<00:00:48.450> five<00:00:48.870> eight<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.680> I<00:00:49.950> fit<00:00:50.219> in<00:00:50.340> there<00:00:50.489> just

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
about five eight and I fit in there just

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.920 
about five eight and I fit in there just
nicely<00:00:51.210> like<00:00:51.600> that<00:00:51.949> the<00:00:52.949> carbon<00:00:53.640> panels<00:00:54.210> which

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
nicely like that the carbon panels which

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.099 
nicely like that the carbon panels which
is<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.379> proprietary<00:00:56.360> heating<00:00:57.360> panel<00:00:57.750> of<00:00:57.899> the

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
is the proprietary heating panel of the

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.910 
is the proprietary heating panel of the
this<00:00:58.500> particular<00:00:58.739> unit<00:00:59.640> is<00:01:00.199> there<00:01:01.199> are<00:01:01.379> six

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
this particular unit is there are six

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.240 
this particular unit is there are six
and<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.609> half<00:01:02.640> panels<00:01:03.449> you<00:01:04.049> have<00:01:04.290> two<00:01:04.619> panels<00:01:04.920> on

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
and a half panels you have two panels on

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.539 
and a half panels you have two panels on
the<00:01:05.369> back<00:01:05.580> wall<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.470> you<00:01:07.470> have<00:01:07.710> one<00:01:08.130> on<00:01:08.369> each

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
the back wall and you have one on each

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.170 
the back wall and you have one on each
of<00:01:08.790> these<00:01:08.939> half<00:01:09.869> walls<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.909> then<00:01:11.909> you<00:01:12.030> have

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
of these half walls and then you have

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.140 
of these half walls and then you have
one<00:01:12.420> above<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.080> so<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.320> are<00:01:13.590> getting<00:01:13.710> a

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
one above you and so you are getting a

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.830 
one above you and so you are getting a
360<00:01:15.150> full<00:01:16.009> 360<00:01:17.009> degree<00:01:17.250> full<00:01:17.580> exposure<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.600> the

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
360 full 360 degree full exposure to the

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
360 full 360 degree full exposure to the
far<00:01:19.110> infrared<00:01:19.140> waves<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.640> this<00:01:21.540> is<00:01:21.720> a<00:01:21.860> huge

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
far infrared waves and this is a huge

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.640 
far infrared waves and this is a huge
part<00:01:23.250> of<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.580> detox<00:01:23.939> program<00:01:24.299> it<00:01:25.110> helps<00:01:25.439> to

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
part of the detox program it helps to

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.210 
part of the detox program it helps to
open<00:01:26.100> up<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.369> cell<00:01:26.580> wall<00:01:26.880> get<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:28.220> the

open up the cell wall get the the

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.550 
open up the cell wall get the the
release<00:01:29.970> of<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.049> flush<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.530> the
