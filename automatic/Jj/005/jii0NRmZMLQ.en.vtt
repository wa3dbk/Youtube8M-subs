00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:05.560
 hi everyone finally it seems that the good 

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:07.120
 accompanies us and I believe that when 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.669
 a dessert appear the fruits is 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.860
 prove impossible to resist I say 

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:13.599
 which should be for the color the aroma and 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.280
 because we also realize that it is not 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:16.990
 necessary to give up the dessert for 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.359
 enjoy healthy vitamins 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.460
 that's why I think these cornets inhibit 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:24.519
 I look for tangerine are perfect for 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.019
 finish a meal overhand the 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:29.349
 ingredients that we are going to use to 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:30.970
 four people are three tangerines 25 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:33.730
 grams of white sugar and others of 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:36.610
 brown sugar 3 sheets of gelatin 3 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:39.309
 clear a pinch of salt 200 milliliters 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:42.640
 of cream to mount 8 sheets of pasta 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:44.770
 edge 35 grams of unsalted butter 20 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.270
 grams of pistachio and mint leaves to 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.640
 decorate 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.140
 to make the mousse the first thing 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.270
 we will be going to be put on a plate with 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.390
 cold water the gelatin so that it 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:57.580
 hydrate then put in a saucepan 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.770
 heat the juice of two tangerines that 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:02.260
 we will have previously filtered and dominate 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.089
 next to sugar and when it starts to 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.620
 warm up we dissolve the leaves of 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.200
 gelatin that we will have drained 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:11.950
 previously and we reserve it remember that 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.750
 usually heat should never boil 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.060
 then we put in a bowl the 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.890
 egg whites with the pinch of salt and 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.650
 we will beat them until we get the point 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.450
 of fear is to say we have to give the 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.640
 return to the bowl and these should not be 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.380
 fall if you see when you go around 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.030
 cheeses come to you do not continue 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.030
 continue beating a few more minutes 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.260
 On the other hand we will put in a bowl the 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.180
 cream and we will mount it to be more 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.860
 easy to mount it as always an average 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.290
 hour before you put in the freezer the 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.330
 utensils ie the container the 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.510
 cream and the rods and it will be everything more 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.510
 easy 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.760
 once we have it we will have to go 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.560
 integrating half of the cream with the 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.400
 clear making enveloping movements 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.400
 from top to bottom 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.810
 when we see that everything is more or 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.069
 less integrated we started to go 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:16.510
 adding emilio juice 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.510
 and we keep stirring 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.080
 when we finish adding all the 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.950
 juice we will continue with the other half of 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.950
 the cream that we have left 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.480
 all right 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.890
 finally we will put the cream in a 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.140
 pastry bag with smooth nozzle but 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.300
 big and we let it set in the fridge 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.890
 for two hours so we do not miss 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.720
 come out it's better to be closed in a 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.880
 end or putting a plug or 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.820
 just cover it with zeal and so we 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.380
 we make sure that nothing falls 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.480
 while we let the mousse come together 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.310
 we put to make the cones for it 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.810
 We spread a sheet of filo paste over 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.790
 the work surface and the grease 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.070
 with butter that we will have melted in 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.930
 the microwave when we have it 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.010
 folding the sheet in half and 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.350
 we go back to wet a little 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.330
 butter and we wrap a mold of 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.980
 product that we will place on the 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.770
 oven tray in which we will have 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.450
 put sulfurized paper remember to put together 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.370
 the molds with a drop of oil 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.560
 although they are non-stick so that 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.420
 then we can answer unmold the 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.190
 more easily 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.990
 and in this case he has used a sheet 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.120
 circular if you only find sheets 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:32.160
 rectangular you join first a sheet 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.709
 with butter and put another one on top 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.840
 that also grease 'aces' after the 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.250
 short in three strips along and 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.590
 wrap is a contest mold with 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:44.569
 each strip and we will repeat this operation 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.569
 with the rest of the phyllo sheets 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.690
 when we have them all 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.000
 we will introduce the oven tray that 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.190
 we will have preheated to 180 degrees 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.140
 for 5 minutes that is the time 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.510
 approximate where they will begin to put 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.910
 golden when we take them out we leave them 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:05.120
 cool and then unmold them with 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:07.190
 careful making a small turn 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.840
 for assembly it will be very simple 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.120
 to present them simply 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.580
 we will fill the courses with both on 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.160
 the lime we will explore the pistachios 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:18.380
 chopped and serve them with the segments 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.680
 of tangerine and the mint leaves that 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.780
 we will have previously washed 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.280
 so I hope you liked it and that 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.710
 was encouraged to do them because they are 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.360
 perfect to finish a meal and already 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.650
 you know that if you have any questions for 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.419
 make these mousse cones 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.220
 Mandarin can you tell me in the 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:35.259
 comments if I will answer you as much 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.000
 possible fast and if you liked the
