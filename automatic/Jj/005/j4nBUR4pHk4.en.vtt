00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 hello dear friends in the previous one 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.390
 video I was talking about simple and fast 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.710
 installation of ventilation grilles on 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.929
 ceramic tiles 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.139
 Well, in this master class I will make a speech 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.000
 o quick quick and easy installation 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:18.330
 plastic mini hatch still call it 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.640
 revision of the door or access door 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.500
 our case which will serve as access to 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.039
 given value for inclusion and 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.109
 turn off the water supply to the toilet bowl 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:29.699
 still pride box frame in 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.890
 which all these will be hidden 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.770
 communications when mounting panels on 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.170
 the framework will need to be in advance 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.239
 put a label on the panel where it will be 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.090
 be located in the future, our power 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.829
 sky glitch after mounting boxes can 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.010
 It will be easy to do and 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.120
 installing our plastic any 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.789
 the center we noted earlier 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.670
 roughly this is our valve further 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:57.090
 put in this way our trick by 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.920
 center of this tag and put on whores by 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.449
 level 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.510
 outline the outline of the hatch on the panel 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.970
 pencil further using mini grinder 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:10.460
 and inserted therein at regular disk 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.460
 steel gently make slots 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.290
 but not to the corners as much as possible 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.530
 overdo it further just by 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.970
 cutter with a sharp razor blade 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.970
 neatly cut corners 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:32.190
 further to the back of our door 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.790
 access to this way we apply liquid 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.770
 nails and put the hatch in its place in our 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.980
 after a couple of hours 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.080
 it will stick already tightly probably 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.300
 many of you now understand that this 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.790
 the way is much simpler and easier in your 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.670
 performance than the one when for each 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.440
 access door revision at construction 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:55.040
 different boxes initially when 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.479
 the corbos framework 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.060
 provide special openings under 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.490
 the size of the various hatches to 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:07.009
 later already when finishing the hatch from the inside 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.009
 it was possible to secure the screws frame 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.650
 and I almost forgot if you get out 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.840
 yourself put plastic pens then 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.630
 buy quality and comfortable in 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.580
 applying hatches and simply put it here 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.830
 such when pressing a finger she 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.190
 opens itself at such hooks 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.290
 there is a spring lock and when 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.640
 closing it snaps 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:34.769
 and in itself does not open a 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.390
 That is, such sales options 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:37.500
 which to open them and need 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.900
 talk their fingernail 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.150
 or something else is worth something not 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.660
 cheaper comfortable hatches village on some 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.610
 60 or 70 rubles for accidents that have 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.590
 perhaps me today and everything and me 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.959
 it remains flamme just say goodbye and 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.530
 wish you only good and profitable 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.049
 shopping

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:59.280
