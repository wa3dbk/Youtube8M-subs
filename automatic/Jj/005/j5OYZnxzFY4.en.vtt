00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.410
 A) Yes 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.300
 Welcome to a new tutorial 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:23.090
 digital photographer dotcom in which 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.849
 let's see an effective and simple method 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.730
 to touch up eyelashes and eyebrows in 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:31.369
 a portrait you will see we have here this 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:34.129
 portrait on the screen we will see a 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.710
 little bigger one hundred percent if we 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:38.210
 we fix in the good eye area in the 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.239
 portrait is a portrait he has already retouched 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.940
 has a frequency separation about 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:46.100
 adjustments in the background even in the area 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.470
 of the eye there are several things but we 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.170
 We will fix only and exclusively 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.729
 eyebrows and eyelashes and if you look now at 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.910
 eyebrows and eyelashes I will do not 

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:58.270
 visible this layer 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:01.090
 and you see how 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:03.820
 eyebrows and eyelashes go from being 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.590
 more bushy to be less bushy this 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.960
 is the retouch that we're going to see 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.240
 continuation how it is done although it seems 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.210
 lie we will not use the brush 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.060
 to paint over the eyelashes but 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:20.290
 let's create an adjustment layer or 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:22.420
 filling in this case a layer of curves 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.730
 is already created and now what we are going to 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.520
 do with this layer of curves is 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:29.470
 darken the image in general so 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.900
 I put myself in the center and throw it 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.030
 down and darkens it with no os 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.550
 I can say how much is only you will have 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.400
 to see you but in any case 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:41.650
 it's something that always once it's 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:45.160
 done you can always do it again 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:47.800
 click on the curve and readjust it and 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:51.760
 put it as we want, I'm going to 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.590
 leave here for example like that and what 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.180
 let's do now because well if we 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.160
 we now see what has happened was 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.170
 simply that we have left the 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.720
 very dark portrait let's do not 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:05.020
 visible the effect of this layer of curves 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:08.080
 so putting myself on top of her I'm going to 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.990
 click on the control layer mask 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.580
 and to invest it and it has already gone back to 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.560
 negre therefore does not let us see the 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.040
 effect 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.150
 now let's look 100% in the eye 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.680
 one of them 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.230
 let's select the brush 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.670
 and we are going to take the white paint put 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.680
 what are we going to paint on top of this 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.750
 layer mask that is black and that we're going 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.430
 to do with the brush then very simple 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.549
 We are going to discover all the 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.859
 dark that are going to turn 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:38.500
 apparently in eyebrows or 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:40.840
 of the tabs but first let's do 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.379
 an adjustment in the brush giving EFE 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.379
 5 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:49.959
 here in this icon that appears to us in 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.370
 the brush settings first what 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.500
 what I'm going to do is that this brush 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.690
 place of being redondito as they tend 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.180
 be I'm not going to I'll narrow it down 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.159
 little bit 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.549
 and the seconds that I'm going to come here to 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:04.709
 dynamic of form and instead of that the 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:07.590
 control of the size variation be 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:10.260
 off I'm going to put it you see that 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.329
 gives a stroke a little too uniform 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.389
 I'm not going to put on pen pressure that 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:17.849
 allows us to have a thickness that varies in 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:21.530
 function of what we press with the pencil 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:25.260
 Optical good with this adjustment made 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:28.409
 I'm going to put the opacity of my painting to 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:32.069
 60 percent 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:34.470
 I'm going to touch up this area here 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:39.569
 down that are finer hairs I'm going to 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:42.389
 adjust a brush about 10 pixels and 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:44.540
 a hardness around 14 or 15 for 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:49.170
 a hundred nothing more 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:51.650
 and with that I will come and try to 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.650
 to draw 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:58.640
 lashes that look realistic that 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:02.480
 have more or less the same form the 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:07.750
 same intensity as the others that already 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.750
 they are in that area 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:18.310
 this is a job of course that is 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.739
 try to paint therefore it is a 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.440
 question of trial and error if we do not 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:26.040
 like we just undo and go back 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.040
 to create 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:35.070
 that simple, we have to control 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:37.470
 our intensity etc well if we see 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:40.380
 now the layer palette make visible 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:43.110
 a visible you see as already the eyelashes 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:46.140
 inferiors have become denser and 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:48.870
 we could of course continue working 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:52.350
 and creating new tabs that would mark 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:55.500
 a certain difference with the before and the 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:58.650
 after like this reason in the eyebrows 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:01.440
 we can do exactly the same maybe 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:04.410
 for the eyebrows we are going to use a 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:07.350
 brush a little older I'll take it then 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:09.060
 up to 16 pixels and we will be testing 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:12.370
 for example here in these areas that 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:16.530
 they light up a little I can go adding 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.530
 some additional hair 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:25.300
 and now let's fine tune 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:27.850
 when we all have all positions 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:31.260
 let's make them look like a 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:33.660
 little more realistic now you will see how 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:38.210
 Well, well, we can simply go 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:38.210
 painting in different areas 

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:49.370
 and now so that you notice less what 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:51.980
 we are going to do is come here to this 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:53.900
 Layer Mask let's see let's 

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:55.610
 visualize the layer mask for a 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:57.650
 moment I'm going to click on it 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:02.090
 this is what we have done we have painted 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:04.700
 a series of beige hairs of eyebrows 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:07.280
 eyelashes well now what I'm going to 

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:10.160
 to do with them is to apply a filter 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:13.310
 of blurring in Gaussians so that 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:17.950
 confuse better with their environment so 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:20.530
 I come to filter blur 

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:22.210
 that focus cause I'm not going to put 

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:24.610
 on top of any of the lashes that 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:28.450
 are painted these for example I'm going 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:31.510
 to apply a blur because of 11 and 

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:33.460
 medium in short is a bit to eye as there 

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:35.950
 what do you see that this area here 

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:38.410
 of the eyebrows that seems to be 

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:40.540
 they noticed more the strokes he had made 

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:41.950
 Well now, however , you can see 

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:45.700
 very much less are very well 

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:48.220
 integrated so I give it to ok 

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:51.280
 now he would do the same with the other eye 

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:53.920
 As you can see the technique is tremendously 

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:55.750
 simple and good let's see the before and 

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:58.900
 the after 

00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:01.150
 and you can see perfectly how the 

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:05.260
 effect is very realistic as they improve 

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:07.510
 pretty and good is a way to 

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:10.660
 do it if we do not want to get to the effect 

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:14.050
 more extreme to use the brushes of 

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:15.820
 false eyelashes on which I have 

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:20.740
 made another tutorial that you could see 

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:22.690
 here in this link but if you do not want 

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:26.400
 complicate ourselves with them this is a way 

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:26.400
 simple and effective to do it
