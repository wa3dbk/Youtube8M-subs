00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 so where people what it's back on 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.460
 strong today I have another one 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.280
 but not for you today 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.070
 very monkeys of the unique or 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:12.960
 person's guide but once an e type 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.580
 to a very special etec weapon in 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.170
 which is almost with the village 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.460
 I would almost equate 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.650
 So it's going to be an extreme 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:26.189
 strong ethics weapon and indeed has become 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:28.529
 here today around the gdf over to the bfd 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.480
 landscape that is an idec weapon of 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.430
 mali were received in all elements 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.960
 can and also about all that means 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.550
 You have no opponent you do for it 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.250
 you have to get out of one 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.020
 Chest of any boss you can 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.790
 really get it everywhere and that 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.890
 makes the weapon so rare no 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.070
 real destination so I have 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.090
 now get from terry matthews show 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.449
 I you even later as I 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:55.379
 So, really get it everywhere 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.820
 of each trade boss opponents might of 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.320
 and you can get a little million 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.609
 who get from the factory you can me 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.090
 dropped everywhere get from any 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.710
 chest 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.270
 that's just so hard 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.890
 generally world class frank subject 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.140
 etec items just look at it 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.220
 it may not be the pdf creator 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.830
 because he is really a very good one 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.290
 alternative to the extremely rare village 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.470
 song launcher he is almost equal too 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:20.250
 so make so many people see the 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:21.630
 bfc also better than in peace several 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.880
 reasons for one of the elements effect 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.000
 at the pbf error and a lot higher 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.470
 but when flees there but I go 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.869
 simply the damage values ​​through and 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.270
 then shows you the reason harm 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:34.530
 done on the ground made harm 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.869
 from 8 02 million 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.850
 I have the priests free fix here 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.170
 or is pronounced again because she 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.310
 not in any case makes the del 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.210
 he ends up as usual 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.590
 probably a little less 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.549
 Damage to that will be about eight 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.640
 his millions 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:50.399
 Accuracy is at 84 the ride 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.530
 09 the charging speed at 68 and 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.610
 the magazine size at 4 and this was at 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.829
 52 percent 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.049
 which is really an extremely high chance 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.240
 I can do that on the elemental effect 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.219
 you all bad now without it 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.509
 lay on an unkempt body 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.040
 shows me as I said I only have this 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.390
 leak mission German 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.399
 but I'll show it to you anyway that was 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.570
 There were ten million each now 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.860
 I was at the nine so one 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.630
 little wonder because the damage 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.220
 in principle no difference whether 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.850
 now with the beast or with the wheel 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.230
 raiders is playing eleven again 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.120
 Millions and without that offers 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.670
 I personally think the Berghain is great 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.690
 difference 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.890
 I'll show you now will be easy 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.300
 a bit of gameplay with the launcher 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.020
 which I then briefly by the way 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.610
 Leave a Comment 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.490
 It simply looks like the launcher sun 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.110
 then action will show 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.490
 I'll give you the job as I do 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.780
 I got it from t 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.550
 get home office to drop as I said 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.770
 you can get everywhere in Germany 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.300
 So if attack shop somewhere just 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.250
 keep your eyes open for the launcher 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.470
 really strong as I said now 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.300
 with all the elements with a fixed one 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.680
 formally iban and there a bit the 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.910
 keep your eyes shut you can see that, too 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.860
 village is located in the rest of Austria no 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.840
 a bit of ammo and then I show 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:01.560
 just once in the frost at the canyon 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:04.140
 just a little bit the watch on 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.580
 best i think is the shock prefix 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.950
 I would say in general 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.720
 holds against very many units very much 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.030
 strong but as I said the weapon that 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.200
 extremely rare also just plays hard 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.790
 because you do not know where 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.519
 you should have it so you have it now 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.080
 No specific goal could be terror 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:21.750
 get them from getting six-month 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.580
 Can anyone wait for you ? 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.780
 So, as I said, that's what it's got 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.310
 problem with the weapon that you can not 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.019
 really knows where to have them 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.489
 I just randomized it yesterday 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:33.810
 get dripped more than me 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:34.950
 actually the deep dangers I have 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.420
 I just did not get any 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:40.830
 extremely happy with real rare 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:42.239
 drops and that's it, I think it's up 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.190
 in any case to get the place if there 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:46.410
 again some 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:50.880
 rarer is a lot harder too 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:53.340
 get as the tvf the lorscher so 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.080
 is many people say so and the 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.340
 simply much more is generally worth the trend 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:00.510
 which weapon to drive and then gets 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:02.910
 you stop recording and how 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.770
 usually a bit better 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.170
 if you have another other element 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:08.310
 have slack outside because of course 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.350
 still makes good weapon damage 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.950
 but also so much just then all 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:15.660
 loose if you have another other one 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.130
 have things and as you may have seen 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:22.140
 I have the weapon again 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:23.340
 that big splash damage and power 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.530
 so also with neat and right 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.360
 Massively much damage must only look 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.340
 that I'm living here in the meantime 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.890
 has already consumed too 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.990
 Relatively much ammo is on the fleet 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:36.150
 is like saying yes is not surprising but it 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:39.240
 The motto stay very similar to both 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.920
 active helpers are since the start of 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.270
 This time just prefer to take and 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.910
 as you said you get with that 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:47.070
 rocket launcher everywhere so you can 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.650
 It has come back everywhere 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.380
 just the connection and job and then 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.340
 says goodbye now because 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.200
 I comment not again since looks 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.590
 you just play a little and you 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:00.180
 get the job or I think about it 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.700
 as always, very cordially for spectators 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.020
 and I hope you all did 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:05.700
 liked what helped us so it 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.169
 really a very strong maybe 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.850
 the other of you already 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:11.250
 subconsciously leave it at some point 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:12.960
 because he okay if I do not so now 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.820
 the sixth, but really the 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.250
 lounge as very strong should 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.540
 get any case or hold her anyway 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.740
 gets the most just happened 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.000
 you can drive it at all if you 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.260
 you want to get it someday 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.780
 blocked then it is how could now 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:26.040
 not really set a goal though 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.990
 just that you are there if you generally 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.820
 driving to keep his eyes open had one 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.830
 Ethics weapon drop generally holds no 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.270
 intex wants to collect I think I need 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.500
 I usually nothing so strong 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.900
 it should just be an eye on it 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.820
 throw it if not maybe the pbf 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.230
 the lancia is and then hott theirs 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.780
 People and I think we'll see each other 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:46.110
 next time bye 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:51.990
 I do not know then it will be like 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:53.460
 always power yes not so I have it 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:56.419
 seen again by frank 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.419
 carius 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:08.810
 what the gfk was doing to some 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.810
 this little rocket launcher this one
