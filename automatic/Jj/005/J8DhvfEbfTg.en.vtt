00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
gave me the other day or I do a fourth

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.630 
gave me the other day or I do a fourth
set<00:01:25.050> it's<00:01:26.050> basically<00:01:26.500> a<00:01:26.590> pyramid<00:01:27.070> routine<00:01:27.430> and

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
set it's basically a pyramid routine and

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:33.030 
set it's basically a pyramid routine and
I<00:01:27.729> did<00:01:29.040> 175<00:01:30.040> then<00:01:30.940> 185<00:01:31.540> then<00:01:31.869> to<00:01:32.380> 10<00:01:32.680> but<00:01:32.979> I

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
I did 175 then 185 then to 10 but I

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.400 
I did 175 then 185 then to 10 but I
couldn't<00:01:33.310> really<00:01:33.360> get<00:01:34.360> ten<00:01:34.600> reps<00:01:34.869> with<00:01:35.050> 210<00:01:35.350> I

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:35.410 
couldn't really get ten reps with 210 I

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.400 
couldn't really get ten reps with 210 I
got<00:01:35.649> nine<00:01:35.830> kind<00:01:36.130> of<00:01:36.190> quite<00:01:36.340> lockout<00:01:36.670> 10<00:01:37.410> but

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:38.410 
got nine kind of quite lockout 10 but

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.200 
got nine kind of quite lockout 10 but
hopefully<00:01:38.740> that's<00:01:38.860> routine<00:01:39.250> I<00:01:39.280> can<00:01:39.880> make<00:01:40.030> some

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
hopefully that's routine I can make some

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.320 
hopefully that's routine I can make some
