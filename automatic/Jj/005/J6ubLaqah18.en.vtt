00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:12.070
 you can see that you are only a topper, it is clear that it is an interview 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.189
 with Novum the abuse lost business 

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:18.050
 the footballer of the year 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:19.660
 yes i will find this again 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.619
 of course it has to get off with a smashing firework 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.980
 there's a loud bang asking 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.039
 and actually 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.609
 the parquet 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:30.609
 for the same reason refusing to control is there in the 

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.100
 the fireworks company so to speak 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:40.800
 and m who have asked who wanted a fireworks package so one that's called 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.550
 Hetert Jan Polling made crazy figure work 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.090
 and those people can use the term such a package with arrows and decorative fireworks every year 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.180
 find bengals 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.180
 Graham totally cheerful and I had to laugh so terribly 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.700
 I can imagine you well 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.340
 flares with make me crazy 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.540
 their arrows with an ugly dragon 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.180
 I no longer have any strength for tickets on the toppers, I think this is so original 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.400
 We see unfortunately it is certainly seeing them fireworks sick on a lead 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.660
 no one understands it not interconnected we must moderate intercourse with the government 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.450
 all the fireworks 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:15.720
 I'm busy 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.939
 I do have what you always secretly stand out or you do not know yet 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.460
 the rocket he 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.050
 I also watched a race on my theater tour that contained alcohol 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.400
 is on the arena and the fireworks are in the accident of course there was fireworks 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.460
 delicious 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.930
 it is very childish I know but the child is getting used to motorbikes 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.450
 but of course it is here about safety falls speak for itself 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.210
 or for yourself that you do what you want I if I do not have to go to the parquet 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.670
 sit of course that is 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.270
 that is absolutely not true 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.770
 the unions and the 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.260
 grenades that are not in it is a fire show he show fireworks and 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:51.280
 decorative fireworks 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.990
 so that is already less dangerous anyway 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.270
 but it remains natural 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.450
 You have to be careful of course 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.420
 a fireworks package in store for the first single in November 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.610

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.450

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:11.859
