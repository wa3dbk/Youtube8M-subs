each of these pawns is mutually blocked

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.899

they<00:01:18.659> can't<00:01:18.930> move<00:01:19.110> forward<00:01:19.580> now<00:01:20.580> let's<00:01:20.790> look

they can't move forward now let's look

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.289 
they can't move forward now let's look
at<00:01:21.060> how<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.299> pawns<00:01:21.659> capture<00:01:22.790> pawns<00:01:23.790> always

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
at how the pawns capture pawns always

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.370 
at how the pawns capture pawns always
capture<00:01:24.810> ahead<00:01:25.290> one<00:01:25.650> square<00:01:26.040> diagonally<00:01:27.380> so

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
capture ahead one square diagonally so

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.710 
capture ahead one square diagonally so
the<00:01:28.530> white<00:01:28.710> pawn<00:01:29.009> at<00:01:29.189> e4<00:01:29.610> can<00:01:29.939> capture<00:01:30.240> the

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
the white pawn at e4 can capture the

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.870 
the white pawn at e4 can capture the
black<00:01:30.930> pawn<00:01:31.229> at<00:01:31.439> d5<00:01:34.159> here's<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.250> position<00:01:35.759> that

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
black pawn at d5 here's a position that

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.370 
black pawn at d5 here's a position that
illustrates<00:01:36.420> how<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.630> pawn<00:01:36.960> captures<00:01:39.229> here<00:01:40.229> we

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
illustrates how a pawn captures here we

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.929 
illustrates how a pawn captures here we
have<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.560> position<00:01:40.829> where<00:01:41.189> black<00:01:41.400> has<00:01:41.670> two

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
have a position where black has two

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.330 
have a position where black has two
knights<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:42.619> white<00:01:43.619> has<00:01:43.829> a<00:01:43.860> lowly<00:01:44.159> pawn<00:01:46.340> the

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
knights and white has a lowly pawn the

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.149 
knights and white has a lowly pawn the
pawn<00:01:47.610> however<00:01:48.140> can<00:01:49.140> move<00:01:49.380> forward<00:01:49.860> and

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
pawn however can move forward and

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.410 
pawn however can move forward and
threaten<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.250> capture<00:01:53.700> each<00:01:53.909> of<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.270> other

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
threaten to capture each of the other

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.139 
threaten to capture each of the other
knights<00:01:55.310> the<00:01:56.310> pawn<00:01:56.549> does<00:01:56.759> not<00:01:56.909> capture

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
knights the pawn does not capture

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.060 
knights the pawn does not capture
straight<00:01:57.600> ahead<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:58.560> pawn<00:01:58.799> captures

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
straight ahead the pawn captures

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.990 
straight ahead the pawn captures
diagonally

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
diagonally

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.480 
diagonally
thus<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.869> pawn<00:02:01.079> threatens<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:01.920> capture<00:02:02.340> this

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
thus the pawn threatens to capture this

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.469 
thus the pawn threatens to capture this
knight<00:02:02.820> at<00:02:03.299> D<00:02:03.750> six<00:02:04.079> and<00:02:04.350> this<00:02:04.469> night<00:02:04.710> at<00:02:04.920> f6<00:02:05.479> and

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
knight at D six and this night at f6 and

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.270 
knight at D six and this night at f6 and
I've<00:02:06.869> put<00:02:07.110> a<00:02:07.140> couple<00:02:07.500> more<00:02:07.530> pieces<00:02:07.890> on<00:02:08.160> the

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
I've put a couple more pieces on the

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.900 
I've put a couple more pieces on the
board<00:02:08.810> here<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:10.050> pawn<00:02:10.289> at<00:02:10.649> he4<00:02:11.459> can<00:02:11.730> move

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
board here the pawn at he4 can move

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.320 
board here the pawn at he4 can move
ahead<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.450> e5

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
ahead to e5

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.780 
ahead to e5
now<00:02:15.380> the<00:02:16.380> pawn<00:02:16.650> is<00:02:16.920> blocked<00:02:17.280> from<00:02:17.520> further

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
now the pawn is blocked from further

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.370 
now the pawn is blocked from further
movement<00:02:18.270> by<00:02:18.390> this<00:02:18.450> Knight<00:02:18.780> and<00:02:19.050> he<00:02:19.140> can't
