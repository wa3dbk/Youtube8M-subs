00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.110 
yeah enemy HUD world icon visibility
alright<00:02:16.060> let's<00:02:16.480> turn<00:02:16.720> all<00:02:17.050> this<00:02:17.230> stuff<00:02:17.530> down

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
alright let's turn all this stuff down

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.410 
alright let's turn all this stuff down
and<00:02:19.120> let's<00:02:19.390> go<00:02:19.540> down<00:02:19.720> to<00:02:19.750> like<00:02:20.080> say<00:02:21.060> 35%<00:02:22.060> here

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
and let's go down to like say 35% here

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.080 
and let's go down to like say 35% here
and<00:02:23.020> then<00:02:23.140> again<00:02:23.350> this<00:02:23.500> is<00:02:23.560> hipfire<00:02:24.100> vs.<00:02:24.880> zoom

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
and then again this is hipfire vs. zoom

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.170 
and then again this is hipfire vs. zoom
levels<00:02:25.480> and<00:02:26.230> again<00:02:27.040> you<00:02:27.160> can<00:02:27.310> you<00:02:27.820> could<00:02:28.000> pick

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
levels and again you can you could pick

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.150 
levels and again you can you could pick
whatever<00:02:28.360> you<00:02:28.570> want<00:02:28.630> and<00:02:29.200> I'm<00:02:29.860> just<00:02:30.010> gonna

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
kind of do this so you can see the

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.630 
kind of do this so you can see the
difference<00:02:32.350> here<00:02:33.210> and<00:02:34.350> almost<00:02:35.350> done<00:02:35.740> so<00:02:36.430> we're

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
difference here and almost done so we're

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.910 
difference here and almost done so we're
changing<00:02:36.970> everything<00:02:37.660> distance<00:02:38.380> health<00:02:38.620> bars

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
changing everything distance health bars

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.640 
changing everything distance health bars
etc<00:02:39.600> we're<00:02:40.600> dropping<00:02:40.810> it<00:02:41.050> all<00:02:41.170> down

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
etc we're dropping it all down

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.140 
etc we're dropping it all down
alright<00:02:42.460> so<00:02:43.140> now<00:02:44.140> look<00:02:44.860> at<00:02:44.950> the<00:02:45.490> name<00:02:45.790> plates

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
alright so now look at the name plates

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.820 
alright so now look at the name plates
above<00:02:46.330> them<00:02:46.750> are<00:02:46.930> a<00:02:46.990> little<00:02:47.170> bit<00:02:47.350> more<00:02:47.380> faint

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
above them are a little bit more faint

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.730 
above them are a little bit more faint
and<00:02:48.220> when<00:02:48.910> I<00:02:48.940> 80s<00:02:49.480> they're<00:02:49.870> even<00:02:50.200> more<00:02:50.230> faint

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740 
and when I 80s they're even more faint

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.400 
and when I 80s they're even more faint
now<00:02:51.100> I<00:02:51.130> can<00:02:51.460> keep<00:02:51.640> that<00:02:51.850> high<00:02:52.120> right<00:02:52.990> I<00:02:53.170> could

so<00:03:03.100> let's<00:03:03.340> go<00:03:03.460> in<00:03:03.610> let's<00:03:04.090> go<00:03:04.210> to<00:03:04.300> gameplay

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
so let's go in let's go to gameplay

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.590 
so let's go in let's go to gameplay
let's<00:03:05.740> go<00:03:05.890> into<00:03:06.100> advanced<00:03:06.490> and<00:03:06.730> something

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
let's go into advanced and something

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.840 
let's go into advanced and something
like<00:03:07.780> this<00:03:08.050> enemy<00:03:08.440> HUD<00:03:08.620> I<00:03:08.920> could<00:03:09.490> keep<00:03:09.610> that

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
like this enemy HUD I could keep that

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.940 
like this enemy HUD I could keep that
high<00:03:10.210> I<00:03:10.600> can<00:03:10.840> keep<00:03:11.020> the<00:03:11.140> info<00:03:11.470> high

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
high I can keep the info high

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.580 
high I can keep the info high
but<00:03:12.400> then<00:03:12.550> when<00:03:12.700> I<00:03:12.730> 80s<00:03:13.390> a<00:03:13.420> little<00:03:13.810> bit<00:03:13.990> I<00:03:14.230> could

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
but then when I 80s a little bit I could

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.070 
but then when I 80s a little bit I could
do<00:03:14.710> something<00:03:15.040> like<00:03:15.070> this<00:03:15.510> it's<00:03:16.510> up<00:03:16.690> to<00:03:16.810> you<00:03:16.959> if

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
do something like this it's up to you if

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.650 
do something like this it's up to you if
this<00:03:17.200> gets<00:03:17.350> in<00:03:17.500> the<00:03:17.620> way<00:03:17.770> but<00:03:18.459> it<00:03:18.910> helps<00:03:19.270> so

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
this gets in the way but it helps so

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.360 
this gets in the way but it helps so
there<00:03:19.930> we<00:03:20.020> go<00:03:20.050> look<00:03:20.650> how<00:03:20.770> bright<00:03:20.980> those<00:03:21.100> are

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.449 
there we go look how bright those are
and<00:03:21.730> not<00:03:22.450> as<00:03:22.660> much<00:03:22.959> of<00:03:23.200> a<00:03:23.620> drop<00:03:23.830> off<00:03:23.980> and<00:03:24.280> then

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
and not as much of a drop off and then

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.190 
and not as much of a drop off and then
keeping<00:03:25.030> the<00:03:25.150> friendlies<00:03:25.510> where<00:03:25.870> they're<00:03:26.050> at
