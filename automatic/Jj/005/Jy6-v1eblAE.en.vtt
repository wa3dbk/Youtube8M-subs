00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
pub sites are polymer really strong nice

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.549 
pub sites are polymer really strong nice
polymer<00:00:43.980> so<00:00:44.219> don't<00:00:44.430> worry<00:00:44.550> about<00:00:44.670> it<00:00:45.000> guys<00:00:45.559> um

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
polymer so don't worry about it guys um

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.540 
polymer so don't worry about it guys um
uh<00:00:47.090> you<00:00:48.090> have<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:48.440> very<00:00:49.440> nice<00:00:49.710> retractable

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
uh you have a very nice retractable

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.180 
uh you have a very nice retractable
stock<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.210> how<00:00:51.750> you<00:00:51.809> retract<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:52.500> is<00:00:52.680> you<00:00:53.010> take

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
stock and how you retract it is you take

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.430 
stock and how you retract it is you take
the<00:00:53.219> button<00:00:53.610> just<00:00:53.910> push<00:00:54.239> in<00:00:54.420> then<00:00:55.230> you're

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
the button just push in then you're

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.130 
the button just push in then you're
attracted<00:00:55.890> I<00:00:56.610> would<00:00:57.239> compare<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.690> stock<00:00:57.930> to

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
attracted I would compare the stock to

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.040 
attracted I would compare the stock to
an<00:00:58.230> ACR<00:00:58.559> psych<00:00:58.980> type<00:00:59.609> stop<00:00:59.910> just<00:01:00.239> simply<00:01:00.930> by

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
an ACR psych type stop just simply by

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.619 
an ACR psych type stop just simply by
the<00:01:01.079> looks<00:01:01.469> I'm<00:01:01.910> no<00:01:02.910> it<00:01:03.090> doesn't<00:01:03.329> function

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
the looks I'm no it doesn't function

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.399 
the looks I'm no it doesn't function
like<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.260> magpul<00:01:05.070> stock<00:01:05.369> but<00:01:06.180> it<00:01:06.330> is<00:01:06.479> similar<00:01:07.110> to

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
like a magpul stock but it is similar to

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.600 
like a magpul stock but it is similar to
a<00:01:07.439> magpul<00:01:08.010> stock<00:01:08.280> as<00:01:08.549> it<00:01:08.850> looks<00:01:09.030> like<00:01:09.210> one<00:01:09.420> um

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
a magpul stock as it looks like one um

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.340 
a magpul stock as it looks like one um
so<00:01:11.610> then<00:01:11.820> we<00:01:11.939> have<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.510> think<00:01:12.780> they're<00:01:12.900> magpul

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
so then we have I think they're magpul

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.399 
so then we have I think they're magpul
mbus<00:01:13.640> replicas<00:01:14.640> they<00:01:15.360> do<00:01:15.420> remind<00:01:15.869> me<00:01:16.110> of<00:01:16.229> them

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
mbus replicas they do remind me of them

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.270 
mbus replicas they do remind me of them
so<00:01:16.890> I'm<00:01:17.070> not<00:01:17.280> positive<00:01:17.729> but<00:01:18.409> uh<00:01:19.409> they<00:01:20.250> are

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
so I'm not positive but uh they are

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.359 
so I'm not positive but uh they are
again<00:01:20.939> really<00:01:21.299> nice<00:01:21.810> sites<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.530> I<00:01:22.740> love<00:01:23.220> them

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
again really nice sites and I love them

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.440 
again really nice sites and I love them
they're<00:01:23.729> they're<00:01:24.060> really<00:01:24.330> cool<00:01:24.540> um<00:01:26.270> so<00:01:27.270> the

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:51.949 
going to throw it well first you're
going<00:03:50.010> to<00:03:50.099> line<00:03:50.340> these<00:03:50.730> up<00:03:50.790> so<00:03:51.209> the<00:03:51.660> front

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
going to line these up so the front

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:58.309 
going to line these up so the front
sight<00:03:52.290> is<00:03:53.480> sort<00:03:54.480> of<00:03:54.569> in<00:03:56.690> the<00:03:57.690> front<00:03:57.810> sight<00:03:58.109> it

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
sight is sort of in the front sight it

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:00.050 
sight is sort of in the front sight it
just<00:03:58.500> looks<00:03:58.680> like<00:03:58.739> this<00:03:59.010> it's<00:03:59.310> more<00:03:59.609> to<00:03:59.880> the

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
just looks like this it's more to the

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.890 
just looks like this it's more to the
front<00:04:00.780> of<00:04:01.049> the<00:04:01.680> mock<00:04:01.889> charging<00:04:02.340> handle<00:04:02.900> where

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
front of the mock charging handle where

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.379 
front of the mock charging handle where
it<00:04:04.109> also<00:04:04.530> states<00:04:04.799> for<00:04:05.160> airsoft<00:04:05.549> only<00:04:05.970> so<00:04:06.150> you

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:06.389 
it also states for airsoft only so you

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:08.390 
it also states for airsoft only so you
real<00:04:06.810> Glock<00:04:07.139> users<00:04:07.530> that<00:04:07.680> don't<00:04:07.950> recommend

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
real Glock users that don't recommend

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.849 
real Glock users that don't recommend
using<00:04:08.519> this<00:04:08.840> for<00:04:09.840> it<00:04:10.049> might<00:04:10.230> snap<00:04:10.530> in<00:04:10.709> half

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:10.859 
using this for it might snap in half

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:13.670 
using this for it might snap in half
because<00:04:11.160> of<00:04:11.489> the<00:04:11.579> recoil<00:04:12.000> and<00:04:12.959> that's<00:04:13.530> just

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
because of the recoil and that's just

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.289 
because of the recoil and that's just
for<00:04:13.889> the<00:04:14.010> real<00:04:14.160> block<00:04:14.430> know<00:04:14.669> where<00:04:14.819> you<00:04:14.940> care

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
for the real block know where you care

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:17.979 
for the real block know where you care
software<00:04:15.510> you<00:04:15.840> guys<00:04:15.989> are<00:04:16.139> fine<00:04:16.349> all<00:04:17.190> right

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
software you guys are fine all right

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.770 
software you guys are fine all right
stand<00:04:18.989> up<00:04:19.910> sorry<00:04:20.910> about<00:04:20.970> the<00:04:21.150> shaky<00:04:21.329> camera

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
stand up sorry about the shaky camera

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.480 
stand up sorry about the shaky camera
and<00:04:21.989> I'm<00:04:22.200> probably<00:04:22.740> let's<00:04:23.039> try<00:04:23.219> to<00:04:23.280> do<00:04:23.400> with

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
and I'm probably let's try to do with

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.640 
and I'm probably let's try to do with
this<00:04:23.550> one<00:04:23.789> hand<00:04:24.090> will<00:04:24.180> be<00:04:24.210> very<00:04:24.479> difficult<00:04:24.690> but

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
this one hand will be very difficult but

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.200 
this one hand will be very difficult but
I<00:04:25.680> could<00:04:25.860> do<00:04:25.979> it

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
I could do it

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.150 
I could do it
so<00:04:28.210> you<00:04:28.300> might<00:04:28.630> have<00:04:28.750> to<00:04:28.810> mess<00:04:29.080> with<00:04:29.380> the<00:04:29.590> other

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
so you might have to mess with the other

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.450 
so you might have to mess with the other
side<00:04:30.490> of<00:04:31.259> the<00:04:32.259> Rhone<00:04:32.500> eek<00:04:32.650> it<00:04:32.830> to<00:04:33.160> put<00:04:33.370> the

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
side of the Rhone eek it to put the

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.860 
side of the Rhone eek it to put the
Glock<00:04:33.699> in<00:04:34.169> like<00:04:35.169> so<00:04:35.440> and<00:04:35.710> then<00:04:36.569> she<00:04:37.569> lined

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
Glock in like so and then she lined

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.900 
Glock in like so and then she lined
everything<00:04:38.289> up<00:04:40.229> again<00:04:41.229> like<00:04:41.770> so<00:04:42.310> everything

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
everything up again like so everything

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.559 
everything up again like so everything
seems<00:04:43.270> to<00:04:43.419> be<00:04:43.539> in<00:04:44.069> the<00:04:45.069> right<00:04:45.310> place<00:04:45.789> all<00:04:46.449> right

00:04:46.559 --> 00:04:46.569
