00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:10.969
 we conclude the renovation of the bathroom 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.460
 after having firms d 'adore painted the 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:17.350
 tiling is replaced by the sink 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:20.080
 mirror the flush and the shower box 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.640
 my dance is almost finished not me 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.270
 it remains to define it as some 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.760
 accessories 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:27.510
 I start by putting on a nice curtain 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.510
 under the sink 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.430
 on a brass tube we insert the 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.970
 sliding hooks of a curtain of 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.970
 plastic 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.270
 below the top we live two supports a 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.600
 in these we insert the ends 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.600
 of the tube 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.879
 we await the last hook 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:51.039
 finally outside the support 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:53.199
 we insert a little bit on the end of the 

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:55.680
 tube repeat the operation from 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:55.680
 opposite side 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.760
 this radiator under the window has 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:16.350
 need of completion are paid 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:19.680
 easy i found the right idea on a 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.020
 8 mm thick MDF sheet cut out of 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.450
 slightly larger than those 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:28.020
 of the radiator we trace some circles 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.790
 with the compass to drill the holes 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.159
 we use hole saws for 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.540
 drill we check which are the right ones 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.540
 diameters to be used 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.820
 we mount the cup saw on the support 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:47.710
 we intend to use by blocking it with 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.710
 the special screw ring 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:57.820
 we insert the taza saw into the spindle 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:00.340
 of the drill and we proceed to the drilling 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.670
 rest the tip in the center of the hole 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.070
 and the drill is operated by the teeth of the saw 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:11.560
 they penetrate the wood in a short time 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:13.240
 they open a perfect round hole when 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.340
 we have practiced all the holes 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.720
 let's proceed with the finish we perform 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.720
 with a water-based primer 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:26.890
 when it is dry we apply one 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.110
 water-based covering enamel 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.319
 to get the shape of a little fish 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.180
 which will decorate the radiator cover 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:36.970
 we lock a piece of mdf on the counter with 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.250
 two clamps we use a hacksaw 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.290
 alternative connected to the expired king

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.820
 we follow the drawing proceeding 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.820
 slowly 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.490
 after having fitted the panel with two 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.920
 supports the settlements on its back 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:06.250
 we can suspend it by hooking it to the 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.250
 radiator 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.239
 all that remains is to apply a door 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.709
 wipes that we fit on the two 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.709
 supports inhabited at the panel 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:28.280
 we tighten the neighbors with allen 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.280
 the appropriate cadetta 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.950
 the painted fish can be 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.870
 applied on the panel thanks 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.830

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.830

 let's turn the little fish on the panel 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:52.380
 making sure that the holes appear 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.380

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.519
