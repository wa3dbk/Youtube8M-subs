and the capacity to show small icons in

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.870 
and the capacity to show small icons in
the<00:00:22.020> three<00:00:22.199> tips<00:00:22.380> so<00:00:22.890> if<00:00:23.160> I<00:00:23.310> look<00:00:23.340> at<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.670> pig

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
the three tips so if I look at the pig

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.740 
the three tips so if I look at the pig
you<00:00:24.840> can<00:00:24.869> see<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.260> health<00:00:25.670> in<00:00:26.670> form<00:00:27.029> of<00:00:27.119> small

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
you can see the health in form of small

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.550 
you can see the health in form of small
arts<00:00:28.109> and<00:00:28.849> it's<00:00:29.849> dynamic<00:00:30.420> and<00:00:30.689> everything<00:00:31.019> so

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
arts and it's dynamic and everything so

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.490 
arts and it's dynamic and everything so
it's<00:00:31.920> quite<00:00:32.160> in<00:00:32.340> it<00:00:35.329> based<00:00:36.329> on<00:00:36.510> this<00:00:36.690> API<00:00:37.200> I

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
it's quite in it based on this API I

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.690 
it's quite in it based on this API I
decided<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.579> under<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.629> stiff<00:00:39.989> cuts<00:00:40.260> with<00:00:40.920> the

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
decided to under the stiff cuts with the

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.779 
decided to under the stiff cuts with the
cuts<00:00:41.940> which<00:00:42.420> aren't<00:00:42.719> entities<00:00:43.260> so<00:00:44.190> first<00:00:44.520> I

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
cuts which aren't entities so first I

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.830 
cuts which aren't entities so first I
did<00:00:45.890> the<00:00:46.890> gutter<00:00:47.100> sombra<00:00:47.579> so<00:00:48.030> as<00:00:48.300> you<00:00:48.360> can<00:00:48.600> see

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.900 
did the gutter sombra so as you can see
i'm<00:00:48.930> building<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.500> cut<00:00:49.710> right<00:00:49.920> now<00:00:50.129> so<00:00:50.520> you<00:00:50.579> can

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
i'm building a cut right now so you can

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.270 
i'm building a cut right now so you can
see<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.329> remaining<00:00:51.989> time<00:00:52.289> before<00:00:53.010> it's<00:00:53.129> done

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
and you can see the various modules

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.569 
and you can see the various modules
inside<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.190> cart<00:00:59.840> now<00:01:00.840> if<00:01:01.140> I<00:01:01.440> look<00:01:01.469> at<00:01:02.039> cut

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
inside the cart now if I look at cut

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.850 
inside the cart now if I look at cut
itself<00:01:03.049> yeah<00:01:04.049> we<00:01:04.290> can<00:01:04.470> see<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:06.560> lookout<00:01:07.560> and

itself yeah we can see the lookout and
the<00:01:08.250> list<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.640> modules<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.950> the<00:01:10.950> power<00:01:11.159> inside

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
the list of modules and the power inside

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.600 
the list of modules and the power inside
the<00:01:11.700> engine<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.590> since<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:14.070> Scout<00:01:14.340> have<00:01:14.580> a

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
the engine and since the Scout have a

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.080 
the engine and since the Scout have a
tank<00:01:15.600> you<00:01:16.290> can<00:01:16.470> also<00:01:16.650> see<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.580> amount<00:01:18.000> of

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
case you can change any kind of a part

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.089 
case you can change any kind of a part
of<00:01:48.009> it<00:01:48.520> and<00:01:48.729> it's<00:01:49.240> going<00:01:49.509> to<00:01:49.659> always<00:01:49.899> stay<00:01:50.409> well

example here here here and also that
I've<00:02:00.009> zakir<00:02:00.369> i<00:02:00.429> stand<00:02:00.849> still<00:02:01.689> looking<00:02:02.020> good

00:02:02.839 --> 00:02:02.849 
I've zakir i stand still looking good

00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:08.210 
I've zakir i stand still looking good
since<00:02:03.849> those<00:02:05.640> two<00:02:06.640> tips<00:02:06.879> are<00:02:07.149> quite<00:02:07.509> large<00:02:07.780> i

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
since those two tips are quite large i

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.059 
since those two tips are quite large i
put<00:02:09.220> together<00:02:09.420> something<00:02:10.420> similar<00:02:10.959> to<00:02:11.260> the

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
put together something similar to the

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:19.130 
put together something similar to the
original<00:02:12.190> creator<00:02:12.730> of<00:02:13.000> this<00:02:13.209> mod<00:02:15.180> vsw<00:02:16.180> he<00:02:16.359> and

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.470 

res<00:02:20.140> it<00:02:20.290> here<00:02:20.739> so<00:02:21.400> you<00:02:21.489> can<00:02:21.760> shift<00:02:22.060> to<00:02:22.209> get<00:02:22.390> it

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
res it here so you can shift to get it

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.270 
res it here so you can shift to get it
so<00:02:23.440> now<00:02:23.620> it<00:02:24.459> will<00:02:24.730> be<00:02:24.879> only<00:02:25.060> visible<00:02:25.480> when<00:02:26.280> you

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
so now it will be only visible when you

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.800 
so now it will be only visible when you
are<00:02:27.400> using<00:02:27.549> a<00:02:27.790> shift<00:02:28.420> and<00:02:29.880> since<00:02:30.880> it<00:02:31.599> was<00:02:31.780> a

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
are using a shift and since it was a

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.650 
are using a shift and since it was a
really<00:02:32.079> good<00:02:32.349> idea<00:02:32.380> for<00:02:33.040> almost<00:02:33.819> any<00:02:34.120> kind<00:02:34.389> of

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
really good idea for almost any kind of

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.830 
really good idea for almost any kind of
tool<00:02:35.349> tip<00:02:35.560> in<00:02:36.430> game<00:02:36.730> I<00:02:36.989> decided<00:02:37.989> to<00:02:38.230> put<00:02:38.440> it<00:02:38.590> in

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
tool tip in game I decided to put it in

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.629 
tool tip in game I decided to put it in
in<00:02:40.840> the<00:02:41.019> main<00:02:41.169> configuration<00:02:41.410> so<00:02:42.280> you<00:02:42.340> have<00:02:42.609> a

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:42.639 
in the main configuration so you have a

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:45.150 
in the main configuration so you have a
sneak<00:02:43.000> toggle<00:02:43.389> block<00:02:43.630> and<00:02:43.870> if<00:02:44.709> you<00:02:44.769> switch<00:02:45.130> it

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
sneak toggle block and if you switch it

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.629 
sneak toggle block and if you switch it
to<00:02:45.310> yes<00:02:45.730> any<00:02:46.019> block<00:02:47.019> with<00:02:47.500> alternative<00:02:48.459> data

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:48.639 
to yes any block with alternative data

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:53.280 
to yes any block with alternative data
is<00:02:49.480> going<00:02:50.410> to<00:02:50.620> show<00:02:50.859> as<00:02:51.810> press<00:02:52.810> shift<00:02:53.079> from<00:02:53.230> a
