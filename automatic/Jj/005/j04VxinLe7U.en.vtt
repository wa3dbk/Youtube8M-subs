not<00:00:08.760> enough<00:00:08.969> runs<00:00:09.180> today<00:00:09.450> my<00:00:09.660> well<00:00:10.620> of<00:00:10.740> course

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
not enough runs today my well of course

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.859 
not enough runs today my well of course
I<00:00:11.460> think<00:00:11.730> the<00:00:11.820> ball<00:00:11.969> really<00:00:12.150> went<00:00:12.389> they

00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:12.869 
I think the ball really went they

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:14.209 
I think the ball really went they
started<00:00:13.199> off<00:00:13.260> really<00:00:13.410> well<00:00:13.530> with<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:13.770> bad<00:00:14.039> you

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
started off really well with the bad you

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.070 
started off really well with the bad you
know<00:00:14.340> got<00:00:14.940> enough<00:00:15.150> runs<00:00:15.360> on<00:00:15.539> the<00:00:15.629> board<00:00:15.660> to<00:00:15.930> put

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
know got enough runs on the board to put

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.109 
know got enough runs on the board to put
pressure<00:00:16.260> on<00:00:16.529> us<00:00:16.650> and<00:00:16.920> Matthew<00:00:17.760> Hayden<00:00:17.880> got

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
pressure on us and Matthew Hayden got

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.579 
pressure on us and Matthew Hayden got
out<00:00:18.270> initially<00:00:18.779> after<00:00:18.900> that<00:00:19.140> we<00:00:19.260> were<00:00:19.380> under

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:19.589 
out initially after that we were under

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:21.829 
out initially after that we were under
pressure<00:00:19.710> what<00:00:20.699> happened<00:00:21.119> with<00:00:21.300> that<00:00:21.330> run<00:00:21.689> out

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:21.839 
pressure what happened with that run out

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:22.970 
pressure what happened with that run out
because<00:00:22.109> you<00:00:22.259> and<00:00:22.410> bother<00:00:22.589> you<00:00:22.710> were<00:00:22.769> just

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
because you and bother you were just

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.800 
because you and bother you were just
setting<00:00:23.279> it<00:00:23.369> up<00:00:23.490> to<00:00:23.789> go<00:00:23.939> after<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.300> target<00:00:24.449> I

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
setting it up to go after the target I

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.989 
setting it up to go after the target I
think<00:00:25.080> in<00:00:25.169> between<00:00:25.439> cricket<00:00:25.769> bataya<00:00:26.070> tried<00:00:26.849> to

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:26.999 
think in between cricket bataya tried to

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:29.029 
think in between cricket bataya tried to
play<00:00:27.150> for<00:00:27.960> team<00:00:28.109> AVO<00:00:28.259> that<00:00:28.650> was<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.890> reason

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
play for team AVO that was the reason

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.710 
play for team AVO that was the reason
why<00:00:29.279> it<00:00:29.369> happened<00:00:29.730> but<00:00:29.849> it's<00:00:30.359> not<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.539> first

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
why it happened but it's not the first

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:31.790 
why it happened but it's not the first
time<00:00:30.839> it<00:00:31.019> has<00:00:31.140> happened<00:00:31.169> so<00:00:31.529> there's

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
time it has happened so there's

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.020 
time it has happened so there's
something<00:00:31.949> wrong<00:00:32.189> between<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.640> both<00:00:32.790> of<00:00:32.940> us

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
something wrong between the both of us

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.910 
something wrong between the both of us
indefinitely<00:00:33.480> when<00:00:34.410> it<00:00:34.470> comes<00:00:34.650> to<00:00:34.740> running

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
indefinitely when it comes to running

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.369 
indefinitely when it comes to running
between<00:00:35.100> wickets<00:00:35.550> can<00:00:36.360> you<00:00:36.480> pinpoint<00:00:36.809> the

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:37.379 
between wickets can you pinpoint the

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:38.930 
between wickets can you pinpoint the
reason<00:00:37.800> because<00:00:38.129> you<00:00:38.250> look<00:00:38.430> down<00:00:38.550> that<00:00:38.789> side

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
reason because you look down that side

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.760 
reason because you look down that side
you're<00:00:39.149> too<00:00:39.329> good<00:00:39.510> aside<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:40.170> be<00:00:40.260> losing<00:00:40.620> so

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
you're too good aside to be losing so

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.580 
you're too good aside to be losing so
many<00:00:40.860> games<00:00:41.160> I<00:00:41.430> think<00:00:42.180> you<00:00:42.270> know<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.809> pressure

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
many games I think you know the pressure

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.319 
many games I think you know the pressure
if<00:00:43.980> you're<00:00:44.100> not<00:00:44.190> bowling<00:00:44.579> as<00:00:44.699> the<00:00:44.820> pressure

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
if you're not bowling as the pressure

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.360 
if you're not bowling as the pressure
automatically<00:00:45.930> gets<00:00:46.109> transferred<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.739> the

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
automatically gets transferred to the

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.770 
automatically gets transferred to the
batting<00:00:47.670> side<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:48.030> I<00:00:48.120> think<00:00:48.329> overall<00:00:48.570> it's

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
batting side and I think overall it's

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.450 
batting side and I think overall it's
it's<00:00:49.230> just<00:00:49.320> about<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.800> pressure<00:00:49.980> or<00:00:50.280> too<00:00:50.370> many

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
it's just about the pressure or too many

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.770 
it's just about the pressure or too many
runs<00:00:50.730> on<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:50.940> board<00:00:50.969> when<00:00:51.239> you're<00:00:51.390> chasing<00:00:51.539> on

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
runs on the board when you're chasing on

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.150 
runs on the board when you're chasing on
the<00:00:51.840> slow<00:00:52.050> wicket<00:00:52.230> it<00:00:52.440> gets<00:00:52.590> very<00:00:52.649> difficult

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
the slow wicket it gets very difficult

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.130 
the slow wicket it gets very difficult
if<00:00:53.219> you<00:00:53.340> don't<00:00:53.969> get<00:00:54.090> off<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.420> good<00:00:54.510> start<00:00:54.690> so

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
if you don't get off to a good start so

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.660 
if you don't get off to a good start so
I<00:00:55.170> think<00:00:55.260> you<00:00:55.440> know<00:00:55.500> it<00:00:55.649> as<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.100> unit<00:00:56.489> you<00:00:56.579> know

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
I think you know it as a unit you know

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.729 
I think you know it as a unit you know
we<00:00:56.760> have<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:57.030> do<00:00:57.149> well<00:00:57.359> no<00:00:57.480> it's<00:00:57.660> not<00:00:58.050> that<00:00:58.079> only

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
we have to do well no it's not that only

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.830 
we have to do well no it's not that only
one<00:00:59.039> department<00:00:59.429> is<00:00:59.730> not<00:01:00.329> doing<00:01:00.539> well<00:01:00.600> you

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
one department is not doing well you

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.630 
one department is not doing well you
know<00:01:00.960> that<00:01:01.170> pressure<00:01:01.800> gets<00:01:02.190> transferred

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
know that pressure gets transferred

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.070 
know that pressure gets transferred
automatically<00:01:03.089> to<00:01:03.269> a<00:01:03.300> different<00:01:03.600> Department

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
automatically to a different Department

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.020 
automatically to a different Department
is<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.129> feeling<00:01:05.370> that<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.760> Chennai<00:01:05.940> Super

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
is a feeling that the Chennai Super

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.610 
is a feeling that the Chennai Super
Kings<00:01:06.300> are<00:01:06.540> almost<00:01:06.720> waiting<00:01:07.140> for<00:01:07.290> Hussey<00:01:07.590> and

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:07.620 
Kings are almost waiting for Hussey and

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.350 
Kings are almost waiting for Hussey and

doing<00:02:59.599> that<00:02:59.780> harsh<00:03:00.079> i<00:03:00.260> was<00:03:00.439> trying<00:03:00.650> to<00:03:00.709> get

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799 
doing that harsh i was trying to get

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:02.979 
doing that harsh i was trying to get
there<00:03:00.889> to<00:03:00.980> talk<00:03:01.129> to<00:03:01.280> the<00:03:01.370> bowlers<00:03:01.700> but<00:03:01.959> yeah<00:03:02.959> I

think the Richter scale is about three
or<00:03:04.340> four<00:03:04.519> but<00:03:04.879> now<00:03:05.389> look<00:03:05.689> as<00:03:05.810> all<00:03:05.989> good<00:03:06.109> files
