00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.960 
part of it so the right size the right
size<00:00:15.210> for<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.389> Cyr<00:00:15.599> wheel<00:00:15.809> is<00:00:16.049> your<00:00:16.529> height

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:16.970 
size for the Cyr wheel is your height

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.760 
size for the Cyr wheel is your height
plus<00:00:17.970> a<00:00:18.330> fist<00:00:19.050> so<00:00:19.170> it's<00:00:19.260> about<00:00:19.410> three<00:00:19.740> inches

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
plus a fist so it's about three inches

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
this is gnarly so I found my my tubing

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.499 
this is gnarly so I found my my tubing
found<00:01:16.740> my<00:01:16.920> tubing<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:18.270> as<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:18.750> can<00:01:18.900> see<00:01:20.509> I've

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
my air compressor and here you can see

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.170 
my air compressor and here you can see
that<00:01:35.549> I<00:01:36.110> drilled<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.229> little<00:01:37.350> jig<00:01:37.939> so<00:01:38.939> what<00:01:39.150> I

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
that I drilled a little jig so what I

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.810 
that I drilled a little jig so what I
did<00:01:39.299> was<00:01:39.570> I<00:01:39.659> took<00:01:39.689> that<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.259> piece<00:01:40.439> of<00:01:40.590> board<00:01:40.820> the

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
did was I took that a piece of board the

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.560 
did was I took that a piece of board the
inner<00:01:42.000> diameter<00:01:42.630> of<00:01:42.680> that<00:01:43.680> tube<00:01:44.579> it's<00:01:45.329> an<00:01:45.450> inch

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
inner diameter of that tube it's an inch

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.840 
inner diameter of that tube it's an inch
and<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.720> half<00:01:45.750> so<00:01:46.140> I<00:01:46.170> took<00:01:46.290> a<00:01:46.729> cut<00:01:47.729> out<00:01:48.920> an<00:01:49.920> inch

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
and a half so I took a cut out an inch

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.719 
and a half so I took a cut out an inch
and<00:01:51.000> half<00:01:51.060> hole<00:01:52.340> with<00:01:53.340> my<00:01:53.369> with<00:01:53.939> my<00:01:53.970> hole<00:01:54.329> saw

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
and half hole with my with my hole saw

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:01.090 
and half hole with my with my hole saw
and<00:01:56.750> I<00:01:57.750> put<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.079> in<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.290> tube

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.190 

so<00:02:02.100> what<00:02:02.820> I'm<00:02:03.000> trying<00:02:03.210> to<00:02:03.450> do<00:02:03.510> is<00:02:03.660> get<00:02:03.780> Aaron

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
so what I'm trying to do is get Aaron

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:12.140 
so what I'm trying to do is get Aaron
here<00:02:06.260> to<00:02:07.260> expand<00:02:07.620> the<00:02:07.830> tube<00:02:10.610> to<00:02:11.610> open<00:02:11.940> it<00:02:12.030> up

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
here to expand the tube to open it up

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.950 
here to expand the tube to open it up
and<00:02:12.360> get<00:02:12.540> it<00:02:12.690> on<00:02:12.780> and<00:02:13.140> it<00:02:13.620> is<00:02:14.270> extremely<00:02:15.270> hard

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
and get it on and it is extremely hard

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
and get it on and it is extremely hard
on<00:02:16.260> this<00:02:17.040> side<00:02:17.370> I<00:02:18.260> did<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.380> same<00:02:19.590> deal<00:02:19.950> I

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
on this side I did the same deal I

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.820 
on this side I did the same deal I
actually<00:02:20.340> cut<00:02:20.850> a<00:02:22.490> plastic<00:02:24.110> it's<00:02:25.110> in<00:02:25.230> here<00:02:25.530> it

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
actually cut a plastic it's in here it

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.110 
actually cut a plastic it's in here it
was<00:02:26.340> a<00:02:26.400> rubber<00:02:26.700> insert<00:02:27.300> a<00:02:27.480> rubber<00:02:27.720> insert<00:02:28.110> I

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
was a rubber insert a rubber insert I

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.880 
was a rubber insert a rubber insert I
shoved<00:02:30.120> in<00:02:30.209> the<00:02:30.390> two<00:02:30.510> but<00:02:30.660> I<00:02:30.690> taped<00:02:30.990> on<00:02:31.170> so<00:02:31.530> cut

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
shoved in the two but I taped on so cut

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.390 
shoved in the two but I taped on so cut
the<00:02:31.980> idea<00:02:32.280> is<00:02:32.430> I<00:02:32.610> blow<00:02:32.820> air<00:02:33.530> expands<00:02:34.530> the<00:02:35.100> tube

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
the idea is I blow air expands the tube

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.880 
the idea is I blow air expands the tube
and<00:02:35.760> I<00:02:36.209> can<00:02:36.360> slip<00:02:36.570> it<00:02:36.660> on<00:02:36.750> easier<00:02:37.170> now<00:02:37.530> I'm<00:02:37.680> out

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
and I can slip it on easier now I'm out

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.360 
and I can slip it on easier now I'm out
here<00:02:38.040> working<00:02:38.459> in<00:02:38.520> the<00:02:38.610> Sun<00:02:38.880> and<00:02:39.300> because<00:02:40.370> the

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
here working in the Sun and because the

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.570 
here working in the Sun and because the
the<00:02:42.060> plastic<00:02:42.360> when<00:02:42.989> it's<00:02:43.140> cold<00:02:43.470> super<00:02:44.370> hard

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
the plastic when it's cold super hard

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.660 
the plastic when it's cold super hard
super<00:02:44.970> hard<00:02:45.150> to<00:02:45.239> work<00:02:45.800> so<00:02:46.800> I've<00:02:47.010> tried<00:02:47.220> to<00:02:47.340> use

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
super hard to work so I've tried to use

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.850 
super hard to work so I've tried to use
a<00:02:47.700> torch<00:02:48.090> on<00:02:48.300> it<00:02:48.360> and<00:02:48.720> that<00:02:49.290> didn't<00:02:49.470> work<00:02:49.620> so<00:02:49.650> I

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
a torch on it and that didn't work so I

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:50.930 
a torch on it and that didn't work so I

left it out in the Sun I'm trying to get

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.979 
left it out in the Sun I'm trying to get
the<00:02:51.000> pipe<00:02:51.239> hot<00:02:52.370> to<00:02:53.370> go<00:02:53.550> ahead<00:02:53.670> and<00:02:54.150> get<00:02:54.810> and

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
the pipe hot to go ahead and get and

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:00.500 
the pipe hot to go ahead and get and
skin<00:02:55.739> my<00:02:55.950> wheel<00:02:57.230> so<00:02:58.670> that's<00:02:59.670> the<00:02:59.850> deal<00:03:00.060> I've

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.560 
got one section halfway on and I'm
thinking<00:03:04.260> about<00:03:04.320> cutting<00:03:05.250> it<00:03:05.519> and<00:03:05.700> putting<00:03:06.420> a

thinking about cutting it and putting a

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.050 
thinking about cutting it and putting a
seam<00:03:06.989> for<00:03:07.920> each<00:03:08.130> section<00:03:08.430> I'm<00:03:08.580> doing<00:03:08.730> a<00:03:08.790> three

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
seam for each section I'm doing a three

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.950 
seam for each section I'm doing a three
piece<00:03:09.299> wheel<00:03:09.570> so<00:03:10.200> that<00:03:10.230> is<00:03:10.680> it
