00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
this little button over here to the left

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.920 
this little button over here to the left
and<00:01:32.640> that<00:01:32.790> will<00:01:32.939> decrease<00:01:33.530> or<00:01:34.530> make<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.520> time

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
and that will decrease or make the time

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.330 
and that will decrease or make the time
shorter<00:01:36.930> so<00:01:37.140> now<00:01:37.350> it's<00:01:37.500> at<00:01:37.650> two<00:01:37.799> minutes<00:01:38.009> from

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
shorter so now it's at two minutes from

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.840 
shorter so now it's at two minutes from
eight<00:01:38.610> minutes<00:01:38.909> two<00:01:39.299> minutes<00:01:39.329> 19<00:01:40.020> seconds<00:01:40.850> so

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
eight minutes two minutes 19 seconds so

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.090 
eight minutes two minutes 19 seconds so
if<00:01:41.909> i<00:01:42.000> push<00:01:42.210> play<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:43.200> can<00:01:43.320> see<00:01:43.500> it's<00:01:43.740> really

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
if i push play you can see it's really

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.399 
if i push play you can see it's really
speeding<00:01:44.490> it<00:01:44.640> up<00:01:44.729> but<00:01:45.479> in<00:01:45.689> my<00:01:45.720> opinion<00:01:45.899> I<00:01:46.350> think

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
speeding it up but in my opinion I think

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.499 
speeding it up but in my opinion I think
that's<00:01:46.829> still<00:01:47.070> too<00:01:47.250> slow<00:01:47.399> so<00:01:48.149> what<00:01:48.329> I'm<00:01:48.420> going

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509

orange rabbit or bunny on your video

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.950 
orange rabbit or bunny on your video
layer<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:55.860> then<00:01:56.460> where<00:01:57.030> it<00:01:57.090> says<00:01:57.149> duration<00:01:57.810> I

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
layer and then where it says duration I

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.350 
layer and then where it says duration I
want<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.229> change<00:01:58.439> that<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.880> let's<00:01:59.880> say<00:02:00.060> 1

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
want to change that to let's say 1

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.450 
want to change that to let's say 1
minute<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:00.810> 30<00:02:00.990> seconds<00:02:01.530> by<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:01.860> way<00:02:02.070> that's

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
minute and 30 seconds by the way that's

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.480 
minute and 30 seconds by the way that's
what<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.939> time<00:02:03.119> is<00:02:03.149> going<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.450> be<00:02:03.540> on<00:02:04.490> the

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
what the time is going to be on the

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.550 
what the time is going to be on the
video<00:02:05.759> itself<00:02:06.090> so<00:02:06.329> 1<00:02:06.540> minute<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:06.930> 30<00:02:07.079> seconds

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
video itself so 1 minute and 30 seconds

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.969 
video itself so 1 minute and 30 seconds
so<00:02:07.829> now<00:02:08.069> it's<00:02:08.340> and<00:02:09.030> if<00:02:09.750> I<00:02:09.840> hold<00:02:09.989> shift<00:02:10.319> Z<00:02:10.500> this

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
so now it's and if I hold shift Z this

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.949 
so now it's and if I hold shift Z this
will<00:02:11.190> just<00:02:11.370> fill<00:02:11.670> in<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:12.300> video<00:02:12.750> in<00:02:12.870> our

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
will just fill in the video in our

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.580 
will just fill in the video in our
timeline

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
timeline

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.220 
timeline
but<00:02:13.980> now<00:02:14.190> it's<00:02:14.550> going<00:02:14.730> to<00:02:14.819> speed<00:02:15.660> it<00:02:15.690> up<00:02:15.900> even

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
but now it's going to speed it up even

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.880 
but now it's going to speed it up even
more<00:02:16.410> so<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:17.459> shorter<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.269> time<00:02:18.450> so<00:02:19.290> say<00:02:19.560> 30

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
more so the shorter the time so say 30

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.650 
more so the shorter the time so say 30
seconds<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.519> faster<00:02:20.910> it's<00:02:21.000> going<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.180> be<00:02:21.330> so

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
seconds the faster it's going to be so

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.270 
seconds the faster it's going to be so
longer<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.290> time<00:02:22.500> so<00:02:22.739> like<00:02:22.890> five<00:02:23.790> minutes<00:02:24.060> the

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
longer the time so like five minutes the

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.500 
longer the time so like five minutes the
longer<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.670> video<00:02:26.910> is<00:02:27.000> going<00:02:27.120> to<00:02:27.180> be<00:02:27.300> so<00:02:27.480> I

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
longer the video is going to be so I

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.059 
longer the video is going to be so I
push<00:02:27.840> play<00:02:28.080> you<00:02:28.500> can<00:02:28.620> see<00:02:28.769> it's<00:02:28.890> really

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
push play you can see it's really

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.240 
push play you can see it's really
speeding<00:02:29.580> up<00:02:29.790> and<00:02:30.030> this<00:02:30.989> is<00:02:31.230> a<00:02:31.590> speed<00:02:32.099> art

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
speeding up and this is a speed art

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.920 
speeding up and this is a speed art
that's<00:02:32.489> what<00:02:32.700> it's<00:02:32.849> called<00:02:33.030> so<00:02:33.599> this<00:02:33.840> is

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
that's what it's called so this is

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.960 
that's what it's called so this is
really<00:02:34.080> cool<00:02:34.349> and<00:02:34.560> that's<00:02:35.310> pretty<00:02:35.549> much<00:02:35.670> what

bottom here you can see it's a little

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.420 
bottom here you can see it's a little
longer<00:02:53.510> it's<00:02:54.510> if<00:02:55.200> I<00:02:55.319> go<00:02:55.470> back<00:02:55.500> to<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:55.950> end<00:02:56.130> it

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
longer it's if I go back to the end it

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.000 
longer it's if I go back to the end it
is<00:02:56.970> three<00:02:57.329> minutes<00:02:57.599> and<00:02:57.720> 25<00:02:58.079> seconds<00:02:58.560> in<00:02:58.709> 20

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
is three minutes and 25 seconds in 20

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.490 
is three minutes and 25 seconds in 20
milliseconds<00:02:59.549> so<00:02:59.579> if<00:02:59.910> I<00:03:00.720> want<00:03:01.079> to<00:03:01.230> make<00:03:01.379> it

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
milliseconds so if I want to make it

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.470 
milliseconds so if I want to make it
bigger<00:03:01.709> some<00:03:02.400> people<00:03:02.700> just<00:03:02.730> click<00:03:03.120> and<00:03:03.269> drag

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
bigger some people just click and drag

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.800 
bigger some people just click and drag
and<00:03:03.750> like<00:03:04.560> the<00:03:05.459> end<00:03:05.670> of<00:03:05.940> our<00:03:06.060> video<00:03:06.209> clip<00:03:06.629> and

and like the end of our video clip and

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.319 
and like the end of our video clip and
then<00:03:07.170> we'll<00:03:07.319> try<00:03:07.500> to<00:03:07.620> drag<00:03:08.280> it<00:03:08.310> to<00:03:08.670> match<00:03:09.090> the

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
then we'll try to drag it to match the

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:11.780 
then we'll try to drag it to match the
end<00:03:09.480> that<00:03:10.140> will<00:03:10.260> not<00:03:10.440> work<00:03:10.470> what<00:03:11.400> you<00:03:11.459> have<00:03:11.670> to

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
end that will not work what you have to

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.640 
end that will not work what you have to
do<00:03:11.940> is<00:03:12.209> you<00:03:12.420> would<00:03:12.569> have<00:03:12.810> to<00:03:12.989> match<00:03:13.170> the<00:03:13.379> time

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
do is you would have to match the time

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.650 
do is you would have to match the time
of<00:03:14.220> your<00:03:14.370> song<00:03:14.640> so<00:03:14.849> three<00:03:15.090> minutes<00:03:15.329> and<00:03:15.420> 20

of your song so three minutes and 20
seconds<00:03:15.989> in<00:03:16.170> 20<00:03:16.670> milliseconds<00:03:17.670> so<00:03:17.700> what<00:03:17.880> I<00:03:17.910> do

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
seconds in 20 milliseconds so what I do

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.780 
seconds in 20 milliseconds so what I do
is<00:03:18.150> I<00:03:18.450> go<00:03:18.480> back<00:03:18.780> to<00:03:19.019> the<00:03:19.109> rabbit<00:03:19.380> here<00:03:19.560> I<00:03:19.790> change

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
is I go back to the rabbit here I change

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:28.009 
is I go back to the rabbit here I change
the<00:03:20.970> duration<00:03:21.350> to<00:03:22.350> three<00:03:22.709> minutes<00:03:25.850> 25<00:03:27.019> seconds

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
the duration to three minutes 25 seconds

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:32.120 
the duration to three minutes 25 seconds
and<00:03:28.790> 20<00:03:29.790> so<00:03:30.090> push<00:03:30.299> enter<00:03:30.720> now<00:03:31.590> we<00:03:31.650> will<00:03:31.950> match

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
and 20 so push enter now we will match

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.449 
and 20 so push enter now we will match
perfectly<00:03:33.139> the<00:03:34.139> very<00:03:34.349> end<00:03:34.590> right<00:03:34.799> here<00:03:34.950> so<00:03:35.220> now

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
perfectly the very end right here so now

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.020 
perfectly the very end right here so now
it<00:03:35.730> matches<00:03:36.090> the<00:03:36.410> video<00:03:37.410> itself<00:03:37.829> so<00:03:38.670> if<00:03:38.849> it's<00:03:38.970> a

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
it matches the video itself so if it's a

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.729 
it matches the video itself so if it's a
little<00:03:39.120> too<00:03:39.329> big<00:03:39.450> just<00:03:39.510> simply<00:03:40.170> cut<00:03:40.530> it<00:03:40.620> off

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
little too big just simply cut it off

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:44.680 
little too big just simply cut it off
right<00:03:40.920> there<00:03:41.130> and<00:03:41.370> now<00:03:42.000> it<00:03:42.450> will<00:03:42.630> play<00:03:42.870> exactly

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
right there and now it will play exactly

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.199 
right there and now it will play exactly
so<00:03:45.690> we'll<00:03:45.870> have<00:03:45.959> the<00:03:46.139> same<00:03:46.380> time<00:03:46.919> so<00:03:47.430> that's

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
so we'll have the same time so that's

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:49.940 
so we'll have the same time so that's
really<00:03:48.419> really<00:03:49.049> cool<00:03:49.139> if<00:03:49.500> you<00:03:49.620> want<00:03:49.829> to

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
really really cool if you want to

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:55.050 
really really cool if you want to
experiment<00:03:50.669> selfish<00:03:51.269> play

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.430 

I<00:03:56.459> don't<00:03:57.459> want<00:03:57.580> to<00:03:57.640> get<00:03:57.819> copyrighted<00:03:58.390> but<00:03:59.140> yeah

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
I don't want to get copyrighted but yeah

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.740

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
so you can see that it's now matching

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.100 
so you can see that it's now matching
the<00:04:02.410> song<00:04:02.860> and<00:04:03.130> if<00:04:03.849> i<00:04:03.940> push<00:04:04.120> play<00:04:04.390> it's<00:04:04.930> going

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:06.930 
the song and if i push play it's going
to<00:04:05.140> match<00:04:05.349> it<00:04:05.530> up<00:04:05.650> with<00:04:05.709> this<00:04:06.160> song<00:04:06.459> so<00:04:06.730> that's

to match it up with this song so that's

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.750 
to match it up with this song so that's

pretty<00:04:15.250> much<00:04:15.370> behind<00:04:15.640> the<00:04:15.880> scenes<00:04:16.090> so<00:04:16.419> that<00:04:16.450> is

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
pretty much behind the scenes so that is

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.349 
pretty much behind the scenes so that is
how<00:04:17.139> you<00:04:17.200> do<00:04:17.350> a<00:04:17.380> speed<00:04:17.709> art<00:04:17.889> but<00:04:18.850> i'm<00:04:19.000> gonna<00:04:19.150> do

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
how you do a speed art but i'm gonna do

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:24.840 
how you do a speed art but i'm gonna do
i<00:04:19.950> think<00:04:20.950> a<00:04:21.100> minute<00:04:21.810> 40<00:04:22.810> seconds<00:04:23.740> 40<00:04:24.490> 50<00:04:24.820> I

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
i think a minute 40 seconds 40 50 I

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.280 
i think a minute 40 seconds 40 50 I
minute<00:04:25.180> 50<00:04:25.419> seconds<00:04:25.690> I<00:04:25.840> think<00:04:26.020> that<00:04:26.110> would<00:04:26.200> be

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
minute 50 seconds I think that would be

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:32.159 
minute 50 seconds I think that would be
good<00:04:26.320> it's<00:04:26.980> not<00:04:27.100> too<00:04:27.280> fast<00:04:27.520> or<00:04:27.760> too<00:04:27.790> slow<00:04:31.169> maybe

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169 
good it's not too fast or too slow maybe

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:33.780 
good it's not too fast or too slow maybe
maybe<00:04:32.500> a<00:04:32.620> minute<00:04:32.919> 30<00:04:33.160> seconds<00:04:33.550> would<00:04:33.639> be

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790 
maybe a minute 30 seconds would be

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.640 
maybe a minute 30 seconds would be
better<00:04:33.940> so<00:04:34.720> I'm<00:04:34.930> gonna<00:04:35.020> go<00:04:35.139> with<00:04:35.260> a<00:04:35.320> bit<00:04:35.530> a

better so I'm gonna go with a bit a

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.100 
better so I'm gonna go with a bit a
