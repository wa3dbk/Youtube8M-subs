00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 or the reset eros and reset heras we are going to 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.370
 make one of those dishes that do not leave 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.340
 indifferent to anyone 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.120
 some ribs in barbecue sauce 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.190
 we start putting in a container 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.599
 quite a part of ketchup 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.599
 another vinegar 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.230
 honey stocking 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.789
 and two parts of water 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.180
 we add now a spoonful of sugar 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.050
 a good pinch of salt 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.680
 and as always ground pepper 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.620
 Now we remove and integrate well all 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.620
 the ingredients 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:11.210
 once done this we put in the sauce 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:11.210
 still uncooked pork ribs 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.800
 cover and let macerate one night 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.800
 whole in the refrigerator 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.140
 the next day we removed the ribs 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.890
 of the sauce and place them on a 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.890
 oven tray 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.729
 and we take a few spoonfuls of the sauce 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:44.659
 so that in the oven the rib is not 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.659
 excess dry 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.290
 done this we booked the ribs and 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.390
 put them to roast yet 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.610
 now we proceed to cook the sauce 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.230
 we put the bowl on a gentle fire and 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:01.590
 well the ribs on it 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:03.390
 we let cook about 45 minutes that go 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.530
 reducing so there is concentration 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.869
 of flavors 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.580
 past this time when I have taken the 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.250
 texture that you see in the images already 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.360
 it will be ready it was a little liquid but 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.490
 I did not fool you 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.890
 it is because it is very hot when cooled 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:20.260
 it will get much denser now if 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.030
 we put the rib to sara to the oven what 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.920
 We pre-heat to 200 degrees 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.980
 centigrade heat up and down and 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.500
 we put the last ribs about 20 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.950
 minutes we take them out with great care of 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.950
 do not burn 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.690
 and we painted it with the barbecue sauce and 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.690
 cooked 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:54.360
 we turn them over so that they cook 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.360
 uniformly on all sides 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.300
 and we also painted barbecue sauce 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.300
 this side 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.730
 done this turn to bake others 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.730
 20 minutes of cooking 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:29.640
 and after the time we turn off the oven 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.640
 we remove the ribs 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:37.220
 and if we really like barbecue sauce 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.710
 we repaint if we do not serve such and 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.660
 as it is and to enjoy if you like
