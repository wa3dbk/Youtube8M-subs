00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:07.500
 the kidneys are the organs that develop 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.110
 rinse him they are located inside 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.599
 fakes according to bert at the height of the 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.730
 first lumbar vertebra and both 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.920
 last ribs as we show 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.410
 this sequence the right kidney is located 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.770
 under the liver and the left kidney against the 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.680
 missed 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:26.370
 each one is shaped like a bean and measures 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:29.430
 about 12 cm long blue arrow 

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:34.550
 shows us successively the rhin and 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.550
 the ships raynaud the bassiner 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:41.129
 the right ureter carrying him rinses 

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:45.710
 from rhin to bladder bladder 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.710
 itself and the left ureter 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.479
 are we approaching the right kidney 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.260
 to better understand its constitution and 

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:56.789
 its mode of operation 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.559
 by turning it on the building 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.989
 we notice its typical form of 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.780
 beans topped with another organ of 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.909
 black yellow coloring these are the 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.259
 adrenal glands 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:08.610
 on this still picture we can 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:11.100
 distinguish thanks to the little arrow 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.630
 Blue them to himself with his cap 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.140
 the adrenal glands from which we come 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.140
 to speak 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:22.409
 the renal artery the renal vein and 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.090
 the ureter we talked about at the beginning 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.920
 animation to better understand the 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.500
 functioning of the rhine and elaboration 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.479
 lure in it is necessary to penetrate 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.310
 inside of it for that 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.409
 virtually remove the capsule 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.479
 renal which allows us to visualize 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.880
 the parenchyma that is to say the interior 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:45.530
 of the rhine proper the place where 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.530
 develop urine 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:52.350
 here is in detail the internal anatomy of a 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:57.149
 kidney this is a renal pyramid called 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:02:01.700
 also pyramid of evil piggy here 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.700
 now an artery art form there 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:10.519
 a vein art form an artery 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.519
 arcis form 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:24.090
 an artery a loam lauber a vein 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:26.040
 a loam lauber the chalices or and 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.879
 recover him rinne from the 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:33.239
 pyramids of evil piggy the bassinet the 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:36.959
 birth of the ureter and ureter 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:38.730
 himself to understand the mechanism 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.859
 developing lure in by the kidneys 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.079
 it is necessary to enter inside 

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:45.989
 of a pyramid of evil piggy which we 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:48.030
 have just spoken for that let's get into 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:50.609
 direction of one of them he in 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:55.319
 there is a small number 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:57.510
 a dozen on average by 1 here we are 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:00.000
 so inside a pyramid of evil 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.829
 piggy the rhin contains about a 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.540
 million of our francs 1 and front is in 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:06.209
 somehow a small rat in miniature 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.609
 it's in the nose will do that elaborates 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.739
 urine each is not francs includes a 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:12.659
 kidney and renal tubules glomeruli 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.199
 we will review these elements in 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:15.780
 detail 

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:18.620
 to better understand how to make 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.060
 urinated by the human body 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.500
 this part of the animation shows us 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.970
 a renal glomerulus for better 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.919
 understand how it works 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.870
 it's necessary to open it which 

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:28.319
 allows us to visualize the interior of 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.900
 this one 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:33.060
 we find that it consists of a 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.489
 platoon of small arteries containing 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.889
 blood coming indirectly from 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.970
 renal arteries 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:40.889
 every heart contraction 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.290
 materialized by the purple arrow 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:45.389
 allows the sense to invade this glomerulus 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.669
 kidney that we see here in some 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:49.799
 so the glomeruli and infused by the 

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:52.409
 blood that is sent into the vessels 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:55.199
 elected rinne passes through tiny 

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:57.569
 holes in a membrane that looks like 

00:03:55.199 --> 00:04:01.349
 a filter that's called the capsule of 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:04.079
 baumann urine then comes to accumulate 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:09.299
 at the bottom of the glomeruli she is ready to 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:11.129
 be evacuated a zoom on the globule 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:14.150
 kidney will allow us to better 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:17.489
 understand the phenomenon of filtration 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.790
 here we are at the level of the capsule of 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.400
 bowman 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.840
 this extreme rapprochement allows us to 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.380
 understand the operation of this 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.140
 capsule 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.980
 it plays the role of filter between the 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.560
 blood and urine 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:31.450
 only water and small components 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.580
 as well as a large number of waste from the 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:35.530
 plasma that is to say the part of 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.170
 yen kids blood can move on to 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.360
 through this so- called basal membrane 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:41.980
 red blood cells white blood cells 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.930
 platelets and the big molecules of the 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.470
 plasma are retained inside of 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.260
 this one 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.090
 it is the same for the majority of 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.660
 blood proteins that can not 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:54.150
 cross 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:57.100
 this filter because of their high size 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:59.200
 the spill the evacuation of lure in 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.480
 will then continue through a 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:04.300
 network an interlacing of small 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:06.490
 renal tubules, the first of which is 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:09.250
 Proximal bypass tube shown here 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:12.310
 by the small purple arrow him rinne 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:14.830
 continues his journey through lance 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:19.380
 the hatred and the tube around 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:22.630
 distal to finish inside the tube 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:24.490
 collector or lot of urine and 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:27.130
 sometimes reabsorb, that is, 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:30.370
 recover through a hormone called 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:31.780
 antidiuretic hormone for better 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.670
 understand the last part of 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:36.040
 the evacuation of the EU rinne we need 

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:37.870
 to the reverse come out of the pyramid of 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.060
 badly piggy to better visualize the 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:42.700
 lure in process made by the 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.380
 nose will make the little purple arrow 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:46.720
 tells us now the path of 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.550
 lure in first by coming out of the 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.770
 pyramid of evil pig he urine penetrates 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:53.050
 in the chalices raynaud then she 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:56.410
 fills the basins and then continues 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:06:02.650
 his journey to the ureter and finally 

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:05.140
 penetrates inside the bladder we 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:07.510
 let's see here filling the 

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:10.450
 the bladder is talking about urine coming from 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:14.380
 the right ureter and its evacuation by 

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:16.660
 the urethra the urethra is a canal located at 

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:19.270
 inside the penis carrying him 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:21.090
 rinne from the inside of the bladder towards 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:24.090
 outdoors 

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:24.090
 2 

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:27.889
 or
