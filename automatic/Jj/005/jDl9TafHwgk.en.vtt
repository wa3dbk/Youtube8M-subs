combination and fire plants and seeds
you<00:00:13.110> need<00:00:13.380> to<00:00:13.559> make<00:00:13.740> your<00:00:13.920> own<00:00:13.980> hops<00:00:14.309> plant<00:00:14.670> so

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
you need to make your own hops plant so

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
are all got vanilla seed plants in them

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.650 
are all got vanilla seed plants in them
I've<00:00:22.470> labeled<00:00:22.980> them<00:00:23.100> so<00:00:23.880> if<00:00:24.180> I<00:00:24.300> did<00:00:24.480> get<00:00:24.600> a

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
I've labeled them so if I did get a

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.480 
I've labeled them so if I did get a
crossbreed<00:00:25.140> you<00:00:25.320> can<00:00:25.439> instantly<00:00:25.769> instantly

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.520 
so I've had a lot of information around
the<00:01:29.579> internet<00:01:29.820> regarding<00:01:30.479> nether<00:01:30.990> water<00:01:31.290> and

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
the internet regarding nether water and

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.380 
the internet regarding nether water and
that<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:31.860> was<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.310> best<00:01:32.460> way<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.729> get<00:01:33.180> hot

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
that it was the best way to get hot

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.359 
that it was the best way to get hot
plants<00:01:33.900> but<00:01:34.590> as<00:01:34.650> you<00:01:34.770> can<00:01:34.860> see<00:01:34.920> they<00:01:35.130> haven't

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
plants but as you can see they haven't

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.390 
plants but as you can see they haven't
quite<00:01:35.430> matured<00:01:35.850> yet<00:01:36.140> so<00:01:37.140> I<00:01:37.170> haven't<00:01:37.619> managed

over here I have managed to make a hot

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.389 
over here I have managed to make a hot
plant<00:01:44.850> from<00:01:45.420> standard<00:01:45.930> vanilla<00:01:46.229> plants<00:01:46.619> here

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
plant from standard vanilla plants here

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.670 
plant from standard vanilla plants here
using<00:01:47.820> dandelion<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.540> Rose<00:01:48.810> I<00:01:49.079> have<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.380> hops

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
using dandelion and Rose I have a hops

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.200 
using dandelion and Rose I have a hops
plant<00:01:51.409> just<00:01:52.409> standard<00:01:53.009> as<00:01:53.159> you<00:01:53.280> can<00:01:53.430> see<00:01:53.610> this

plant just standard as you can see this

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.569 
plant just standard as you can see this
is<00:01:54.420> what<00:01:54.600> a<00:01:54.630> hot<00:01:54.930> plant<00:01:55.229> looks<00:01:55.470> like<00:01:55.710> you<00:01:56.430> can

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
is what a hot plant looks like you can

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.630 
is what a hot plant looks like you can
tell<00:01:56.790> difference<00:01:57.509> from<00:01:57.689> that<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.200> wheat<00:01:58.950> this

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
tell difference from that and wheat this

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.209 
tell difference from that and wheat this
wheat<00:01:59.939> has<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.420> yellow<00:02:00.750> blocks<00:02:01.500> in<00:02:01.680> it<00:02:01.799> and

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
wheat has the yellow blocks in it and

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.870 
wheat has the yellow blocks in it and
this<00:02:02.369> is<00:02:02.430> just<00:02:02.700> basically<00:02:02.850> green<00:02:04.610> this<00:02:05.610> wasn't

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
this is just basically green this wasn't

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.999 
this is just basically green this wasn't
my<00:02:06.180> I<00:02:06.540> can't<00:02:07.020> say<00:02:07.170> I<00:02:07.200> just<00:02:07.320> put<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.829> plants

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
my I can't say I just put the plants

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.669 
my I can't say I just put the plants
down<00:02:08.340> and<00:02:08.700> it<00:02:08.789> grew<00:02:09.030> one<00:02:09.179> so<00:02:09.479> I've<00:02:10.170> had<00:02:10.410> a<00:02:10.440> few

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
down and it grew one so I've had a few

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:11.890 
down and it grew one so I've had a few
attempts<00:02:11.160> and

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
attempts and

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.380 
attempts and
particular<00:02:12.319> plot<00:02:12.769> about<00:02:13.700> to<00:02:13.849> get<00:02:14.030> rid<00:02:14.180> of<00:02:14.209> the

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
particular plot about to get rid of the

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.899 
particular plot about to get rid of the
plant<00:02:14.659> planted<00:02:15.170> again<00:02:15.500> try<00:02:16.189> it<00:02:16.220> again<00:02:16.430> try<00:02:16.819> it

00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:16.909 
plant planted again try it again try it

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:18.460 
plant planted again try it again try it
again<00:02:17.030> and<00:02:17.360> eventually<00:02:17.930> and<00:02:18.079> now<00:02:18.110> I've

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
again and eventually and now I've

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.009 
again and eventually and now I've
arrived<00:02:18.829> at<00:02:18.980> a<00:02:19.040> hot<00:02:19.250> spot<00:02:19.610> I'm<00:02:20.599> you<00:02:20.720> can<00:02:20.870> see

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
arrived at a hot spot I'm you can see

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:23.710 
arrived at a hot spot I'm you can see
his<00:02:21.110> hops<00:02:21.379> plant<00:02:21.709> if<00:02:21.890> I<00:02:22.040> left<00:02:22.430> click<00:02:22.700> and<00:02:23.060> there

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
his hops plant if I left click and there

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.819 
his hops plant if I left click and there
we<00:02:23.840> go<00:02:24.099> we<00:02:25.099> got<00:02:25.129> two<00:02:25.519> hops<00:02:25.790> and<00:02:26.180> a<00:02:26.510> seed<00:02:26.810> bag<00:02:27.140> if

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:27.829 
we go we got two hops and a seed bag if

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:30.640 
we go we got two hops and a seed bag if
I<00:02:28.069> go<00:02:28.250> over<00:02:28.400> here<00:02:28.959> put<00:02:29.959> it<00:02:30.019> in<00:02:30.109> the<00:02:30.290> crop

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
I go over here put it in the crop

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.059 
I go over here put it in the crop
analyzer<00:02:31.810> put<00:02:32.810> it<00:02:32.900> in<00:02:32.959> it<00:02:33.109> and<00:02:33.349> we<00:02:33.560> have<00:02:33.590> hops

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
analyzer put it in it and we have hops

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:38.759 
analyzer put it in it and we have hops
and<00:02:34.640> we<00:02:34.730> do<00:02:34.849> it<00:02:34.909> again<00:02:35.120> we<00:02:35.989> have<00:02:36.140> hops<00:02:36.409> tf5<00:02:37.540> okay

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
and we do it again we have hops tf5 okay

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:41.920 
and we do it again we have hops tf5 okay
basically<00:02:39.769> that's<00:02:40.090> that's<00:02:41.090> how<00:02:41.299> you<00:02:41.359> get<00:02:41.629> hot

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
basically that's that's how you get hot

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.680 
basically that's that's how you get hot
this<00:02:42.709> as<00:02:43.370> I've<00:02:43.609> explained<00:02:43.909> before<00:02:43.940> is<00:02:44.389> a<00:02:44.420> very

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
this as I've explained before is a very

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.920 
this as I've explained before is a very
hit<00:02:44.959> and<00:02:44.989> miss<00:02:45.400> type<00:02:46.400> of<00:02:46.549> system<00:02:47.000> it's<00:02:47.480> not<00:02:47.540> I

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
hit and miss type of system it's not I

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.539 
hit and miss type of system it's not I
can't<00:02:48.349> tell<00:02:48.560> you<00:02:48.650> just<00:02:48.680> a<00:02:48.980> plant<00:02:49.310> this<00:02:49.489> plant

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:49.549 
can't tell you just a plant this plant

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:51.699 
can't tell you just a plant this plant
that<00:02:50.420> plant<00:02:50.629> and<00:02:50.989> you'll<00:02:51.139> definitely<00:02:51.590> get

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
that plant and you'll definitely get

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.789 
that plant and you'll definitely get
hops<00:02:52.010> as<00:02:52.940> I<00:02:53.239> found<00:02:53.480> after<00:02:53.900> doing<00:02:54.139> all<00:02:54.290> this<00:02:54.349> a

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
hops as I found after doing all this a

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:58.649 
hops as I found after doing all this a
lot<00:02:55.190> of<00:02:55.280> time<00:02:55.489> a<00:02:55.519> lot<00:02:55.819> of<00:02:55.879> patience<00:02:56.769> padne<00:02:57.769> that

00:02:58.649 --> 00:02:58.659 
lot of time a lot of patience padne that

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:01.300 
lot of time a lot of patience padne that
it<00:02:59.659> requires<00:03:00.139> a<00:03:00.260> lot<00:03:00.530> of<00:03:00.560> time<00:03:00.739> and<00:03:00.920> patience

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
it requires a lot of time and patience

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.629 
it requires a lot of time and patience
and<00:03:01.519> a<00:03:01.639> lot<00:03:01.760> of<00:03:01.879> trial<00:03:02.180> and<00:03:02.299> error<00:03:02.480> so<00:03:03.459> as<00:03:04.459> you

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:04.639 
and a lot of trial and error so as you

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:06.399 
and a lot of trial and error so as you
can<00:03:04.700> see<00:03:04.849> now<00:03:04.970> I've<00:03:05.090> got<00:03:05.269> hops<00:03:05.510> and<00:03:05.900> why<00:03:06.170> would

00:03:06.399 --> 00:03:06.409 
can see now I've got hops and why would

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:08.740 
can see now I've got hops and why would
do<00:03:06.650> now<00:03:06.859> if<00:03:07.129> I<00:03:07.280> was<00:03:07.489> running<00:03:07.909> a<00:03:08.150> roleplay

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
do now if I was running a roleplay

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.920 
do now if I was running a roleplay
server<00:03:09.409> so<00:03:10.159> go<00:03:10.430> over<00:03:10.609> and<00:03:10.879> plant<00:03:11.389> these<00:03:11.569> and

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
server so go over and plant these and

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.990 
server so go over and plant these and
then<00:03:12.500> duplicate<00:03:13.129> them<00:03:13.310> next<00:03:13.639> to<00:03:13.730> each<00:03:13.760> other

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
then duplicate them next to each other

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.949 
then duplicate them next to each other
so<00:03:14.299> I<00:03:14.329> can<00:03:14.540> get<00:03:14.689> a<00:03:14.720> lot<00:03:15.019> of<00:03:15.170> these<00:03:15.290> plants<00:03:15.530> going

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
so I can get a lot of these plants going

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.990 
so I can get a lot of these plants going
what<00:03:17.959> I<00:03:17.989> plan<00:03:18.260> to<00:03:18.290> do<00:03:18.530> in<00:03:18.650> future<00:03:18.829> is<00:03:19.310> make<00:03:19.970> a

what I plan to do in future is make a

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.569 
what I plan to do in future is make a
video<00:03:20.209> showing<00:03:20.720> all<00:03:21.109> the<00:03:22.010> different<00:03:22.040> breeds

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:22.579 
video showing all the different breeds

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:25.000 
video showing all the different breeds
you<00:03:22.790> can<00:03:23.060> get<00:03:23.299> and<00:03:23.569> what<00:03:24.290> their<00:03:24.470> advantages

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
you can get and what their advantages

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.990 
you can get and what their advantages
and<00:03:25.069> disadvantages

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
was looking for ways to get hops that is

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:36.699 
the the only way I've been able to find
hops<00:03:35.030> is<00:03:35.239> through<00:03:35.419> trial<00:03:35.720> and<00:03:35.870> error<00:03:36.049> there's

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
hops is through trial and error there's

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.399 
hops is through trial and error there's
no<00:03:36.889> magic<00:03:37.389> potion<00:03:38.389> or<00:03:38.540> magic<00:03:38.959> way<00:03:39.109> of<00:03:39.260> me
