basically<00:00:38.940> it's<00:00:39.690> better<00:00:39.930> in<00:00:40.079> every<00:00:40.290> possible

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
basically it's better in every possible

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.400 
basically it's better in every possible
way<00:00:40.829> they<00:00:41.460> have<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.760> working<00:00:42.450> sample<00:00:42.960> here<00:00:43.320> in

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
way they have a working sample here in

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.410 
way they have a working sample here in
the<00:00:43.530> suite<00:00:43.829> but<00:00:44.309> other<00:00:44.550> than<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:44.820> we<00:00:45.270> don't

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
the suite but other than that we don't

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.389 
the suite but other than that we don't
know<00:00:45.570> too<00:00:45.629> much<00:00:45.870> about<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:46.379> they<00:00:46.530> are<00:00:46.739> quoting

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
know too much about it they are quoting

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.310 
know too much about it they are quoting
that<00:00:47.760> it's<00:00:47.940> capable<00:00:48.149> of<00:00:48.450> up<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.629> 1,800

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
motherboard to put them in so you

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.490 
motherboard to put them in so you
but<00:02:14.280> there<00:02:14.549> they<00:02:14.579> are<00:02:14.879> we<00:02:15.030> have<00:02:15.060> both<00:02:15.420> an<00:02:15.689> 8<00:02:16.230> gig

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
but there they are we have both an 8 gig

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.210 
but there they are we have both an 8 gig
and<00:02:16.769> a<00:02:17.870> 16<00:02:18.870> gig<00:02:19.170> module<00:02:19.650> to<00:02:19.799> show<00:02:19.950> you<00:02:20.010> guys

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
and a 16 gig module to show you guys

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.360 
and a 16 gig module to show you guys
this<00:02:20.459> one<00:02:20.670> right<00:02:20.879> here<00:02:21.299> has<00:02:21.680> 288<00:02:22.680> pins<00:02:22.980> it<00:02:23.159> runs

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
this one right here has 288 pins it runs

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.149 
this one right here has 288 pins it runs
at<00:02:23.519> ddr4<00:02:24.000> 2133<00:02:24.989> which<00:02:25.170> isn't<00:02:25.439> that<00:02:25.620> impressive

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:26.159 
at ddr4 2133 which isn't that impressive

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:27.619 
at ddr4 2133 which isn't that impressive
for<00:02:26.340> now<00:02:26.430> we're<00:02:26.670> expecting<00:02:27.030> to<00:02:27.120> see<00:02:27.269> better<00:02:27.450> by

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 
for now we're expecting to see better by

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:29.539 
for now we're expecting to see better by
the<00:02:27.689> time<00:02:27.780> it<00:02:28.049> actually<00:02:28.079> launches<00:02:28.799> and<00:02:29.010> that's

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
the time it actually launches and that's

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:32.089 
the time it actually launches and that's
at<00:02:29.879> CL<00:02:30.390> 15<00:02:30.900> so<00:02:31.109> the<00:02:31.260> timings<00:02:31.620> are<00:02:31.709> quite<00:02:31.920> loose

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
at CL 15 so the timings are quite loose

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.099 
at CL 15 so the timings are quite loose
but<00:02:32.280> there<00:02:32.430> you<00:02:32.519> have<00:02:32.549> it<00:02:32.790> guys<00:02:32.819> it<00:02:33.480> is<00:02:33.659> working

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:34.109 
but there you have it guys it is working

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:36.229 
but there you have it guys it is working
apparently<00:02:34.859> but<00:02:35.310> of<00:02:35.400> course<00:02:35.609> we<00:02:35.760> can't<00:02:35.970> show

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
apparently but of course we can't show

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:37.759 
apparently but of course we can't show
it<00:02:36.269> working<00:02:36.689> because<00:02:36.870> motherboards

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
it working because motherboards

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:39.410 
it working because motherboards

idea<00:02:51.120> of<00:02:51.209> pretty<00:02:51.690> strongly<00:02:52.230> here<00:02:52.650> and<00:02:52.799> they

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:52.859 
idea of pretty strongly here and they

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:56.059 
idea of pretty strongly here and they
have<00:02:53.040> updated<00:02:53.459> the<00:02:53.639> XP<00:02:54.000> gv2<00:02:54.560> memory<00:02:55.560> module

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
have updated the XP gv2 memory module

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.149 
have updated the XP gv2 memory module
kit<00:02:56.760> line<00:02:57.329> up<00:02:57.599> to<00:02:57.989> now<00:02:58.139> contain<00:02:58.590> many

00:02:59.149 --> 00:02:59.159 
kit line up to now contain many

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:01.220 
kit line up to now contain many
different<00:02:59.609> colors<00:02:59.909> including<00:03:00.540> some<00:03:01.049> ones

different colors including some ones

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.410 
different colors including some ones
that<00:03:01.349> I'm<00:03:01.680> particularly<00:03:02.430> excited<00:03:03.060> about<00:03:03.120> such

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
that I'm particularly excited about such

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.119 
that I'm particularly excited about such
as<00:03:03.540> their<00:03:03.689> matte<00:03:03.930> black<00:03:04.290> and<00:03:04.349> matte<00:03:04.889> white

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:05.129 
as their matte black and matte white

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:07.009 
as their matte black and matte white
spreaders<00:03:05.639> but<00:03:06.120> they<00:03:06.239> also<00:03:06.389> have<00:03:06.659> some<00:03:06.900> pretty

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
spreaders but they also have some pretty

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:08.990 
spreaders but they also have some pretty
outlandish<00:03:07.290> stuff<00:03:07.920> as<00:03:08.099> well<00:03:08.370> so<00:03:08.639> you<00:03:08.730> can

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
outlandish stuff as well so you can

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.149 
outlandish stuff as well so you can
match<00:03:09.269> up<00:03:09.599> to<00:03:09.629> your<00:03:09.780> build<00:03:10.139> pretty<00:03:10.829> much<00:03:11.010> no

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 
match up to your build pretty much no

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:13.460 
match up to your build pretty much no
matter<00:03:11.340> what<00:03:11.730> your<00:03:12.209> build<00:03:12.450> happens<00:03:13.019> to<00:03:13.260> look

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
matter what your build happens to look

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.160 
matter what your build happens to look
like<00:03:13.739> so<00:03:13.920> we've<00:03:14.069> got<00:03:14.250> a<00:03:14.280> pretty<00:03:14.519> sweet<00:03:15.170> purple

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
like so we've got a pretty sweet purple

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.199 
like so we've got a pretty sweet purple
