00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:03.520 
that's kind of cool just to watch up

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:11.340 
that's kind of cool just to watch up
move

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:11.350 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:13.959 

okay<00:00:11.860> there

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:13.969 
okay there

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:16.179 
okay there
okay<00:00:14.809> I'm<00:00:14.959> going<00:00:15.139> to<00:00:15.200> put<00:00:15.379> up<00:00:15.410> on<00:00:15.589> the<00:00:15.740> area<00:00:16.010> to

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:16.189 
okay I'm going to put up on the area to

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:24.420 
okay I'm going to put up on the area to
this<00:00:16.369> side<00:00:16.640> here<00:00:16.910> we<00:00:17.150> go

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:24.430 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:26.710 

Wow

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720 
Wow

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.100 
Wow
cool

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:30.110 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:32.710 

Wow<00:00:30.650> I<00:00:30.680> just<00:00:31.100> love<00:00:31.280> those<00:00:31.430> oscillations<00:00:31.720> there

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:32.720 
Wow I just love those oscillations there

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.860 
Wow I just love those oscillations there
we<00:00:32.870> go

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:44.270 

this<00:00:37.320> what<00:00:37.500> you'd<00:00:37.649> do<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:37.829> black<00:00:38.129> background

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.170 

yeah<00:00:44.850> so<00:00:45.030> that's<00:00:45.150> about<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.420> hundred<00:00:45.750> mils<00:00:47.180> so

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
yeah so that's about a hundred mils so

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.090 
yeah so that's about a hundred mils so
this<00:00:48.330> should<00:00:48.510> put<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:48.840> around<00:00:49.380> 1,100

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
this should put it around 1,100

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:57.790 
this should put it around 1,100
milliliters<00:00:50.720> let's<00:00:51.720> see<00:00:51.900> what<00:00:52.080> happens<00:00:52.530> here

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.779 

aha<00:00:58.830> I<00:00:58.920> just<00:00:59.160> love

00:01:00.779 --> 00:01:00.789 
aha I just love

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:04.770 
aha I just love
look<00:01:01.359> at<00:01:01.570> that<00:01:02.399> amazing<00:01:03.399> just<00:01:04.360> one<00:01:04.570> of<00:01:04.689> these

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
look at that amazing just one of these

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:12.200 
look at that amazing just one of these
jaw-dropping<00:01:05.650> moments

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.630 

okay<00:01:12.960> here<00:01:13.140> we<00:01:13.170> go<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.440> do<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:13.830> again<00:01:14.100> looking

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
okay here we go to do it again looking

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.190 
okay here we go to do it again looking
into<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:14.970> camera<00:01:15.240> big<00:01:15.990> pop<00:01:16.260> here<00:01:16.680> we<00:01:16.800> go<00:01:18.200> all

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
into the camera big pop here we go all

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.950 
into the camera big pop here we go all
right<00:01:19.260> at<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.040> lid<00:01:20.220> I<00:01:20.850> saved<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.600> lens<00:01:23.960> what

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
right at the lid I saved the lens what

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.840 
right at the lid I saved the lens what
I'm<00:01:25.050> planning<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.410> do<00:01:25.650> is<00:01:25.890> after<00:01:26.430> this<00:01:26.700> whole

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
I'm planning to do is after this whole

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.719 
I'm planning to do is after this whole
series<00:01:27.030> of<00:01:27.150> experiments<00:01:27.930> I'll<00:01:28.920> suck<00:01:29.400> all<00:01:29.580> this

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
series of experiments I'll suck all this

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.340 
series of experiments I'll suck all this
water<00:01:30.000> up<00:01:30.180> with<00:01:30.300> a<00:01:30.330> syringe<00:01:30.690> I'll<00:01:30.900> put<00:01:31.110> it<00:01:31.229> back

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
water up with a syringe I'll put it back

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.580 
water up with a syringe I'll put it back
in<00:01:31.590> bags<00:01:31.830> and<00:01:32.280> I'll<00:01:33.000> use<00:01:33.479> it<00:01:33.660> to<00:01:33.690> make<00:01:33.780> tea<00:01:34.229> with

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
in bags and I'll use it to make tea with

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.690 
in bags and I'll use it to make tea with
so<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.310> end<00:01:35.580> up<00:01:35.700> drinking<00:01:36.150> my<00:01:36.330> experiment

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
so I end up drinking my experiment

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.310 
so I end up drinking my experiment

a puff of air on I'm going to put a puff
of<00:02:51.519> water<00:02:51.790> just<00:02:52.540> could<00:02:52.750> have<00:02:52.900> a<00:02:52.930> lot<00:02:53.140> more

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
of water just could have a lot more

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.410 
of water just could have a lot more
momentum<00:02:53.590> in<00:02:54.220> it<00:02:54.370> than<00:02:54.549> the<00:02:54.640> air<00:02:56.099> whoa<00:02:57.099> whoa

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
momentum in it than the air whoa whoa

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.490 
momentum in it than the air whoa whoa
I<00:02:58.450> was<00:02:58.840> afraid<00:02:59.019> oh<00:02:59.260> look<00:02:59.859> at<00:03:00.010> that<00:03:00.250> cool<00:03:00.640> I

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
I was afraid oh look at that cool I

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.530 
I was afraid oh look at that cool I
squirted<00:03:02.500> water<00:03:02.799> through<00:03:03.340> oh<00:03:03.579> isn't<00:03:04.269> that

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
squirted water through oh isn't that

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.649 
squirted water through oh isn't that
cool<00:03:05.109> the<00:03:05.799> water<00:03:06.069> in<00:03:06.280> the<00:03:06.430> sphere<00:03:06.909> went<00:03:07.510> around

00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:07.659 
cool the water in the sphere went around

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:10.170 
cool the water in the sphere went around
the<00:03:07.810> air<00:03:07.900> cavity<00:03:08.260> formed<00:03:08.560> a<00:03:08.620> huge<00:03:08.889> bubble<00:03:09.159> Wow

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
the air cavity formed a huge bubble Wow

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:17.250 
the air cavity formed a huge bubble Wow
oh<00:03:13.260> that<00:03:14.260> is<00:03:14.440> so<00:03:14.650> cool<00:03:15.750> let's<00:03:16.750> see<00:03:16.930> what<00:03:17.109> my

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
oh that is so cool let's see what my

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:23.440 
oh that is so cool let's see what my
hand<00:03:17.590> looks<00:03:17.889> like<00:03:18.129> oh<00:03:18.340> look<00:03:18.639> at<00:03:18.790> that<00:03:18.819> yeah<00:03:19.299> oh

there we go yeah that's good that's good
shows<00:03:28.730> that<00:03:29.000> optics<00:03:29.660> works<00:03:31.000> let's<00:03:32.000> see<00:03:33.250> what

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
shows that optics works let's see what

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:44.360 
shows that optics works let's see what
my<00:03:36.370> mug<00:03:37.370> looks<00:03:37.910> like

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.720 

I<00:03:44.400> could<00:03:44.790> be<00:03:44.940> a<00:03:44.970> human<00:03:45.300> pendulum<00:03:46.400> this<00:03:47.400> shows

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
I could be a human pendulum this shows

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.309 
I could be a human pendulum this shows
the<00:03:48.480> lens<00:03:48.720> lock<00:03:50.569> motion<00:03:51.569> gives<00:03:51.959> in<00:03:52.200> the

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
the lens lock motion gives in the

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:53.990 
the lens lock motion gives in the
opposite<00:03:52.739> direction<00:03:52.890> and<00:03:53.459> the<00:03:53.550> image<00:03:53.700> is

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
opposite direction and the image is

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.030 
opposite direction and the image is
inverted<00:03:54.420> or<00:03:54.870> upside<00:03:54.900> down<00:03:57.140> and<00:03:58.140> yeah<00:03:58.500> I<00:03:58.530> am

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040
