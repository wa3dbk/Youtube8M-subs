00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:55.409 
game plan will be to stop McFadden and

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:57.020 
game plan will be to stop McFadden and
their<00:02:55.650> running<00:02:55.980> game<00:02:56.010> putting<00:02:56.730> a<00:02:56.819> lot<00:02:57.000> of

their running game putting a lot of

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.729 
their running game putting a lot of
pressure<00:02:57.329> on<00:02:57.450> Palmer<00:02:57.720> which<00:02:57.959> may<00:02:58.139> be<00:02:58.200> too<00:02:58.709> much

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
pressure on Palmer which may be too much

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.670 
pressure on Palmer which may be too much
too<00:02:59.400> soon<00:02:59.430> now<00:03:00.389> we<00:03:00.750> all<00:03:00.870> know<00:03:00.900> the<00:03:01.200> NFL<00:03:01.319> is<00:03:01.650> a

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
too soon now we all know the NFL is a

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.559 
too soon now we all know the NFL is a
highly<00:03:02.159> competitive<00:03:02.310> league<00:03:02.819> ok<00:03:03.150> and<00:03:03.359> in<00:03:03.450> my

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
highly competitive league ok and in my

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.479 
highly competitive league ok and in my
opinion<00:03:03.720> it's<00:03:04.170> too<00:03:04.590> hard<00:03:04.769> to<00:03:04.829> step<00:03:05.040> back<00:03:05.220> into

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
opinion it's too hard to step back into

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.430 
opinion it's too hard to step back into
this<00:03:05.579> game<00:03:05.760> after<00:03:05.940> such<00:03:06.269> a<00:03:06.299> lengthy<00:03:06.870> time<00:03:07.049> off

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
this game after such a lengthy time off

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.559 
this game after such a lengthy time off
so<00:03:07.920> I<00:03:08.220> don't<00:03:08.519> know<00:03:08.579> if<00:03:08.639> Kansas<00:03:08.970> City<00:03:09.000> will<00:03:09.329> win

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
so I don't know if Kansas City will win

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.740 
so I don't know if Kansas City will win
