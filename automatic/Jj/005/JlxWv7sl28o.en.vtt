actually touching him with the spur

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.120 
actually touching him with the spur
that's<00:01:21.720> look<00:01:21.900> when<00:01:22.020> we<00:01:22.110> come<00:01:22.320> around<00:01:22.439> again<00:01:22.740> I

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
that's look when we come around again I

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.130 
that's look when we come around again I
think<00:01:23.909> when<00:01:24.000> you<00:01:24.090> come<00:01:24.240> around<00:01:24.360> this<00:01:24.570> next

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
think when you come around this next

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.039 
think when you come around this next
time<00:01:25.409> you<00:01:25.619> can<00:01:25.740> see<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.040> spur<00:01:26.670> is<00:01:26.970> on<00:01:27.600> my<00:01:27.810> leg

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
time you can see the spur is on my leg

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.830 
time you can see the spur is on my leg
but<00:01:28.229> I'm<00:01:28.320> not<00:01:28.439> actually<00:01:29.479> using<00:01:30.479> it<00:01:30.570> see<00:01:30.720> it's

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
but I'm not actually using it see it's

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.770 
but I'm not actually using it see it's
not<00:01:31.020> touching<00:01:31.290> his<00:01:31.619> belly<00:01:31.939> so<00:01:32.939> having<00:01:33.540> your

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
not touching his belly so having your

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.499 
not touching his belly so having your
spur<00:01:34.140> on<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.530> using<00:01:34.860> it<00:01:35.040> are<00:01:35.479> two<00:01:36.479> different

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
spur on and using it are two different

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.420 
spur on and using it are two different
things<00:01:36.840> once<00:01:37.619> you've<00:01:37.829> gotten<00:01:38.040> your<00:01:38.130> leg

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
things once you've gotten your leg

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.780 
things once you've gotten your leg
steady<00:01:38.850> enough<00:01:39.590> that<00:01:40.590> you<00:01:40.799> can<00:01:41.009> choose<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.340> use

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
steady enough that you can choose to use

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.969 
steady enough that you can choose to use
it<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.180> just<00:01:42.229> having<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.320> there<00:01:43.560> doesn't<00:01:43.860> mean
