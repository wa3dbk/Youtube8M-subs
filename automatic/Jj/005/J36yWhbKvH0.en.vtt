00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
inundated with a ton of applications but

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.650 
inundated with a ton of applications but
it's<00:00:19.830> not<00:00:19.949> a<00:00:19.980> really<00:00:20.369> smooth<00:00:20.580> experience<00:00:21.180> the

it's not a really smooth experience the

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.950 
it's not a really smooth experience the

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:23.960 
remote control you wave it around and

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.509 
remote control you wave it around and
that<00:00:24.960> helps<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.289> consumer<00:00:25.740> ground<00:00:26.010> themselves

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
that helps a consumer ground themselves

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.179

that the remote is based on motion do

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.890 
that the remote is based on motion do
that<00:00:29.400> we<00:00:29.789> have<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:29.910> character<00:00:30.420> here<00:00:30.630> his<00:00:30.750> name

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
that we have a character here his name

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.319 
that we have a character here his name
is<00:00:30.929> bean<00:00:31.199> Bert<00:00:31.439> or<00:00:31.650> its<00:00:32.610> name<00:00:32.820> is<00:00:32.940> ben<00:00:33.120> burtt

is bean Bert or its name is ben burtt

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.620 
is bean Bert or its name is ben burtt
and<00:00:33.540> you<00:00:33.899> actually<00:00:34.200> click<00:00:34.410> on<00:00:34.469> it<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:35.309> so<00:00:36.239> when

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
and you actually click on it and so when

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.660 
and you actually click on it and so when
the<00:00:36.750> consumer<00:00:37.140> wakes<00:00:37.350> that<00:00:37.440> up<00:00:37.710> bean<00:00:38.399> bird

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
the consumer wakes that up bean bird

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.209

becomes a personality within the entire

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.280 
becomes a personality within the entire
setup<00:00:41.730> process<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.780> that's<00:00:43.140> really

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
setup process and that's really

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.049 
setup process and that's really
important<00:00:43.829> because<00:00:43.920> when<00:00:44.610> you<00:00:44.700> start<00:00:44.910> putting

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
important because when you start putting

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.700 
important because when you start putting
internet<00:00:45.539> into<00:00:45.690> devices<00:00:46.200> you<00:00:46.350> don't<00:00:46.379> want<00:00:46.620> it

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
internet into devices you don't want it

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.500 
internet into devices you don't want it
to<00:00:46.800> feel<00:00:46.920> like<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.100> computer<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:47.820> want<00:00:48.300> it<00:00:48.420> to

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
to feel like a computer you want it to

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.600

feel<00:00:48.690> like<00:00:48.719> an<00:00:49.020> entertainment<00:00:49.379> device<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:50.039> so

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
feel like an entertainment device and so

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.310

bean burst personality throughout this

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.170 
bean burst personality throughout this
setup<00:00:52.649> process<00:00:52.860> helps<00:00:53.489> interact<00:00:53.910> with<00:00:54.090> the

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
setup process helps interact with the

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.260 
setup process helps interact with the
consumer<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:55.140> actually<00:00:55.500> makes<00:00:55.820> owning<00:00:56.820> a

more tech advanced device more enjoyable

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.529 
more tech advanced device more enjoyable
yeah<00:01:01.710> as<00:01:02.039> we<00:01:02.100> watch<00:01:02.370> this<00:01:02.640> if<00:01:02.879> we<00:01:02.969> try<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.180> skip

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
yeah as we watch this if we try to skip

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.570 
yeah as we watch this if we try to skip
a<00:01:03.570> task<00:01:03.870> like<00:01:04.110> setup<00:01:04.379> here<00:01:04.530> your<00:01:04.979> set-top<00:01:05.189> box

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
a task like setup here your set-top box

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.789 
a task like setup here your set-top box
bean<00:01:06.479> burn<00:01:06.689> will<00:01:06.930> actually<00:01:07.260> throw<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.619> little

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
bean burn will actually throw a little

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.980 
bean burn will actually throw a little
tantrum<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:09.180> bunch<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.420> bean<00:01:09.570> Berg's<00:01:09.810> will

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
tantrum and a bunch of bean Berg's will

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.789 
tantrum and a bunch of bean Berg's will
also<00:01:10.260> go<00:01:10.380> what<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.710> world<00:01:11.189> is<00:01:11.340> going<00:01:11.400> on<00:01:11.760> and

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
through that process and go through that

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.600 
through that process and go through that
setup<00:01:18.060> so<00:01:18.990> there's<00:01:19.320> about<00:01:19.619> nine<00:01:20.070> steps

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
setup so there's about nine steps

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.090 
setup so there's about nine steps
throughout<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.210> entire<00:01:21.830> setup<00:01:22.830> process
