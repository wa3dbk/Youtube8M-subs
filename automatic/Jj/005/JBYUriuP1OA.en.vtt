00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.200
 do not 

00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:23.740
 it was the map of 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:25.689
 of halloween only for today and I'm 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.820
 talking to the map of the programs 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:29.380
 that we have things well worth it because I 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.820
 I think you should record a video with the 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.960
 City program or met the 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:37.510
 fluid program because it bought fluid 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:41.820
 I get worse games like that 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.820
 this one better 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.379
 perfect perfect perfect 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:09.350
 people are catching again with 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.869
 all previous but in this is not that 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:15.520
 all of these items planned those of 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:15.520
 I steal with the program that suits me well 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:27.580
 in halloween it's special since I can 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.580
 play with teams to take advantage of 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.539
 because it was impossible to say 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.009
 yesterday it is clear 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.520
 I'm going to check a box like this 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.750
 because 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:02:00.909
 not only but good, they will be more 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.909
 expensive you never know 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:13.780
 the first day of work but systems to 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:15.450
 We all have perfect times to see what 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:23.810
 such a chest 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:23.810
 obviously we also have a hacker 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.239
 but 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.850
 terrible apocalyptic was his sprinter 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.850
 come on come on 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.090
 There is a poor kid 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:51.840
 it's not good to be looking up 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.720
 a brand 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.200
 and later 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.050
 5 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.360
 towards his prick 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.770
 and what comes 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.010

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:38.890
 so 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.600
 Y 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.540
 perfect perfect 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:58.600
 and do not miss 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.600
 this little one 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:08.940
 it's important to see around here this is how 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:11.310
 bread 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:14.240
 open 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:17.240

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.240
 all right 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.220
 perfect we have two more 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:30.540
 the games with this program 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:38.870
 so for butt 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.870
 16 but they seem more truly 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.900
 we have a very good transport a 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.870
 agenda about the game 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.250
 I was not there anymore because he died so 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:54.130
 let's come to this for the work that 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:54.130
 they have but I need that I go with black 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.190
 to see is over there I do not want to lose 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.169
 of sight because the same dawn 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.779
 you get me whole 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:04.529
 you are already seeing me it is clearer than 

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:04.529
 up to 5 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.350
 is watching we are looking at the sky 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:24.790
 they will be hooked that you are seeing and have 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:28.440
 caught the vote the boat 

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:28.440
 an airplane and a gigabyte 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:32.150
 we have jumped 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.300
 and it is already 

00:05:54.199 --> 00:06:02.150
 but when we have a kid 

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:11.599
 no way 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:20.280
 with the dry grass hacker kid is something 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:23.640
 that I did not care because he killed 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:26.850
 enough people this Saturday 

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:28.140
 almost without shit I did not know what to do or 

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:30.830
 nervous and in the end but good 

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:30.830
