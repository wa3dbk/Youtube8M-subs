you're<00:00:28.630> getting<00:00:28.810> a<00:00:28.990> wig<00:00:29.140> like<00:00:29.170> this<00:00:29.560> use<00:00:30.070> it<00:00:30.400> as

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:30.610 
you're getting a wig like this use it as

you're getting a wig like this use it as
a<00:00:31.030> half<00:00:31.379> half<00:00:32.379> a<00:00:32.529> week<00:00:32.710> and<00:00:32.920> with<00:00:33.100> your<00:00:33.280> hair<00:00:33.520> in

a half half a week and with your hair in

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:35.540 
a half half a week and with your hair in
the<00:00:33.820> front<00:00:34.000> because<00:00:34.210> it<00:00:34.480> doesn't<00:00:34.840> look<00:00:34.960> as<00:00:35.199> bad

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
the front because it doesn't look as bad

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.849 
the front because it doesn't look as bad
as<00:00:36.550> if<00:00:36.699> it<00:00:36.820> were<00:00:36.940> just<00:00:37.300> you<00:00:37.719> know<00:00:37.780> the<00:00:37.870> front<00:00:38.710> of

00:00:38.849 --> 00:00:38.859 
as if it were just you know the front of

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:41.939 
as if it were just you know the front of
this<00:00:39.269> of<00:00:40.269> the<00:00:40.449> hair<00:00:40.629> of<00:00:40.870> the<00:00:41.140> wig<00:00:41.319> right<00:00:41.589> here

00:00:41.939 --> 00:00:41.949 
this of the hair of the wig right here

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:43.680 
this of the hair of the wig right here
where<00:00:42.789> it<00:00:42.819> would<00:00:42.999> just<00:00:43.089> look<00:00:43.210> like<00:00:43.300> a<00:00:43.390> helmet

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:43.690 
where it would just look like a helmet

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.590 
where it would just look like a helmet
just<00:00:44.109> starting<00:00:44.710> here<00:00:44.890> when<00:00:45.100> the<00:00:45.219> wind<00:00:45.399> blows

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
just starting here when the wind blows

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.279 
just starting here when the wind blows
so<00:00:46.600> I<00:00:46.989> mean<00:00:47.170> if<00:00:47.949> my<00:00:48.219> ear<00:00:48.429> was<00:00:48.579> a<00:00:48.640> one<00:00:48.999> be<00:00:49.300> it

00:00:50.279 --> 00:00:50.289 
so I mean if my ear was a one be it

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:52.049 
so I mean if my ear was a one be it
would<00:00:50.499> blend<00:00:50.739> in<00:00:50.949> a<00:00:51.159> lot<00:00:51.339> better<00:00:51.550> and<00:00:51.909> it

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:52.059 
would blend in a lot better and it

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:53.910 
would blend in a lot better and it
wouldn't<00:00:52.479> look<00:00:52.629> as<00:00:52.929> I<00:00:53.289> mean<00:00:53.620> it<00:00:53.679> doesn't<00:00:53.859> look

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
wouldn't look as I mean it doesn't look

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.270 
wouldn't look as I mean it doesn't look
bad<00:00:54.449> but<00:00:55.449> blowing<00:00:56.199> around<00:00:56.409> I<00:00:56.710> certainly<00:00:57.069> felt

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
bad but blowing around I certainly felt

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.279 
bad but blowing around I certainly felt
like<00:00:57.489> oh<00:00:57.670> god<00:00:57.940> I<00:00:58.179> just<00:00:58.210> probably<00:00:58.839> looked<00:00:59.109> like

00:00:59.279 --> 00:00:59.289 
like oh god I just probably looked like

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:02.789 
like oh god I just probably looked like
some<00:00:59.499> mad<00:00:59.679> lady<00:00:59.979> with<00:01:00.249> a<00:01:00.280> wig<00:01:01.559> blowing<00:01:02.559> in<00:01:02.679> the

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:02.799 
some mad lady with a wig blowing in the

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:04.920 
some mad lady with a wig blowing in the
wind<00:01:02.949> but<00:01:03.549> it<00:01:03.699> didn't<00:01:03.940> look<00:01:03.999> bad<00:01:04.059> and<00:01:04.420> I

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
wind but it didn't look bad and I

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.570 
wind but it didn't look bad and I
definitely<00:01:05.110> like<00:01:05.590> that<00:01:05.860> the<00:01:06.070> hair<00:01:06.250> is<00:01:06.280> getting

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
definitely like that the hair is getting

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.330 
definitely like that the hair is getting
a<00:01:06.760> lot<00:01:06.940> more<00:01:06.970> poufy<00:01:07.570> I<00:01:08.070> started<00:01:09.070> a<00:01:09.130> little
