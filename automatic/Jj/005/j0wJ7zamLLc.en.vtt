 how to make these this rich crepes that 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.300
 We did a little while ago in the morning 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.850
 then let's put our crepes 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.129
 already cooked in our hot pan 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.960
 if we are going to put them as to heat 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.340
 a little bit first we're going to 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.010
 heat in our pan that is 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.900
 previously hot 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.790
 I'm going to flip them first, I leave them 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.730
 Warm up to the side then flip it 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.330
 so that our 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.550
 cheese 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.220
 then today's lunch, they're going to be 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:19.910
 some crepita some crea pitas of ham 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:22.490
 with cheese that you think this is 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.590
 very traditional in france in his party 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.540
 that in France they sell it to you on the street 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.390
 like mexico we find the taquitos 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.580
 then there we find the crepas de de 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.260
 ham and cheese we can incorporate the 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.780
 first gel the cheese so that we 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:38.270
 jamoncito melted and then what 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.370
 we can put whole or in parts like 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.110
 as you prefer that we like more 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.360
 like I play because then when 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.430
 we bite the ham and a piece comes out 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.500
 whole like we do not see each other very very 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.960
 beautiful with the step ham whole mouth 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.960
 then there we put our as quoted 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.150
 our cheese and that's what we 're going to 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.820
 we do hope to melt I 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.860
 I really like to always put a 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.770
 little salt and pepper 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.690
 to this as to raise the flavor 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.670
 then at this moment we see and what 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.150
 rich as here those salts the pepper 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.830
 on top of our cheese ham 

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:14.720
 it is here quite hot then 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.360
 our our arts we can do it 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.730
 with your hand if it is hot or with a 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.620
 we can help from a spatula the 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.720
 we can close is let's say it's a close 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.270
 we have a tradition that we can be 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.670
 traditionally or in the form of a handkerchief 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.560
 in four parts as well as you 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.320

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.920
 I will recommend to me I really like it 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.430
 accompany this dish with a water of 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.989

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:11.959
