00:00:01.109 --> 00:00:04.109
 walter ten days was missing a new video of the movie that is today 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.030
 so for the recovery of Russian gas 

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:10.300
 does not produce hydrogen peroxide which is to allow potassium 

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:12.989
 so for lens 

00:00:12.989 --> 00:00:15.889
 we will have the recovery procedure 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:18.650
 from 4 to 8 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.519
 8% previously announced 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:24.769
 who so that this gas of the eleventh century Tuesday 6 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:27.399
 we have here an enemy yesterday to return 

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:29.729
 go on our territory 

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:32.159
 they were every two years earlier with the tubing 

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:33.780
 this one 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.800
 on a beautiful center 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.800
 we note and maintained a balloon a white or pink background 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.830
 from an opinion for cleaning to the end 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.150
 is that they did not get into the video 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.670
 she was happy 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.670
 it adopts hydrogen peroxide 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.650
 to oxygenate 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.410
 1 hydrogen peroxide 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.960
 a report formula the quarter of tabarre family is here 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.800
 so when she was at the controls 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.800
 at least 106 permanent protection 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.310
 parents of potassium students this is where the leads to the four 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.650
 so what I want to show are hydrogen peroxide molecules and 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.750
 potassium chlorate 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.050
 we will first suspend another at the same time burgundy apparently clean 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.320
 that's why the little bit 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.580
 she 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.580
 others were filming 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.010
 pretty much enough 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.030
 we will also need a small plastic spoon to put ko 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.190
 hernandez has now 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:49.860
 in the balloon magnitude 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.380
 we will take notes on the cork 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.009
 to close it to calm the container not so fast 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.270
 ap 

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:13.169
 here we see fairly quickly the game leonidas which fills 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:18.129
 at a fairly high speed 

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:22.229
 3 

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:26.039
 our list in aude and bordeaux 

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:36.669
 % we will use water which will not allow the pursuit 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:40.829
 to aspire political 

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:56.979
 only normally it should have been light we should have done it before 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.899
 turning above all 

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:19.569
 they do the man serves of course that the medium always cars returned or 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:21.809
 about to see what's going on 

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:24.749
 to avoid the loss of gas 

00:03:24.749 --> 00:03:28.119
 here we have the result 

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:31.119
 so there is heat that has been produced 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:39.769
 so we will identify diaz 

00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:47.149
 so with matches 

00:03:48.649 --> 00:03:52.859
 that said we already know that but produced oxygen but it takes 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:56.199
 now prove 

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:59.509
 with matches 

00:03:59.509 --> 00:04:02.509
 but rather a single medium will suffice 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:11.999
 we have now lomÃ© 

00:04:11.999 --> 00:04:15.519
 yes again a work done on i-tv much faster 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:25.079
 so that proves that when we arrived from the oxygen 

00:04:25.749 --> 00:04:29.519
 so we will completely replace or there are those that dirty the skin of the 

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:31.400
 father a little bit last 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.749
 volume of oxygen 

00:04:34.749 --> 00:04:37.749
 so we will capitulate now with the molecules 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:43.590
 in our council 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.319
 than 

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:46.550
 laurent wauquiez 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.550
 So the hydrogen peroxide in Terrebonne 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.339
 the example the potassium tarmac k 2004 

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:56.180
 to be in the group 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.520
 baby doc potassium site here 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.719
 so why 

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:02.939
 manganese dioxins 

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:05.550
 and melodious 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.580
 air and water l uso 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.580
 he was loved to also perform 

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:13.830
 of oxygen here 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.029
 good account 

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:19.029
 it is true that we will ignite with the inra 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:20.490
 to the goulette
