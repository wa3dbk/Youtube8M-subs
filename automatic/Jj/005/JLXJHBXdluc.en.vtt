so<00:02:19.220> Frank<00:02:19.790> chambers<00:02:20.000> going<00:02:20.360> to<00:02:20.420> have<00:02:20.540> less<00:02:20.780> of

so Frank chambers going to have less of
an<00:02:21.170> impact<00:02:21.290> on<00:02:21.620> this<00:02:21.800> weapon<00:02:21.950> I<00:02:22.190> guess<00:02:22.370> then<00:02:22.550> it

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
an impact on this weapon I guess then it

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.430 
an impact on this weapon I guess then it
goes<00:02:22.790> on<00:02:22.970> the<00:02:23.120> original<00:02:23.600> the<00:02:23.960> hundred<00:02:24.230> percent

second shot in your chamber is basically

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.350 
second shot in your chamber is basically
be<00:02:30.560> a<00:02:30.590> lot<00:02:30.800> weaker<00:02:31.070> than<00:02:31.610> the<00:02:31.730> force<00:02:31.970> unless

be a lot weaker than the force unless

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.330 
be a lot weaker than the force unless
you're<00:02:32.570> gonna<00:02:32.660> find<00:02:32.870> yourself<00:02:33.340> reloading

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
you're gonna find yourself reloading

after every forced shot which might not

after every forced shot which might not
be<00:02:36.710> so<00:02:36.860> bad<00:02:36.890> because<00:02:37.250> the<00:02:37.460> reload<00:02:37.790> is<00:02:37.970> a<00:02:38.000> little

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
be so bad because the reload is a little

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:39.940 
be so bad because the reload is a little

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
slightly higher pressure on switch would

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.979 
slightly higher pressure on switch would
be<00:02:55.430> really<00:02:55.640> really<00:02:55.910> welcome<00:02:56.390> so<00:02:56.780> I<00:02:56.810> guess

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
be really really welcome so I guess

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.140 
be really really welcome so I guess

incoming<00:02:59.720> with<00:03:00.110> this<00:03:00.290> okay<00:03:00.650> then<00:03:00.920> I'm<00:03:01.400> not

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
incoming with this okay then I'm not

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.520
