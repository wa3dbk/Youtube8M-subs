spread it on the food plots but they'd

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:12.059

dry<00:02:16.750> but<00:02:17.440> look<00:02:17.650> at<00:02:17.769> the<00:02:17.890> difference<00:02:18.280> in<00:02:18.430> just

dry but look at the difference in just

dry but look at the difference in just
as<00:02:18.760> fescue<00:02:19.390> versus<00:02:20.110> just<00:02:20.290> a<00:02:20.410> foot<00:02:20.650> or<00:02:20.769> two<00:02:20.799> away

where the antler dirt wasn't spread

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.630 
where the antler dirt wasn't spread
incredible<00:02:24.010> difference<00:02:24.400> and<00:02:24.610> that

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
incredible difference and that

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.910 
incredible difference and that
difference<00:02:24.730> is<00:02:25.390> due<00:02:25.690> to<00:02:26.079> the<00:02:26.590> amount<00:02:26.829> of

building up organic matter in your food

haven't<00:03:47.860> had<00:03:47.980> moisture<00:03:48.489> it's<00:03:49.150> incredible<00:03:49.720> how

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
haven't had moisture it's incredible how

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.199 
haven't had moisture it's incredible how
well<00:03:50.049> those<00:03:50.319> beans<00:03:50.620> perform<00:03:51.159> once<00:03:51.970> they<00:03:52.120> had

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
well those beans perform once they had

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:54.089 
well those beans perform once they had
the<00:03:52.329> protection<00:03:52.510> of<00:03:53.079> that<00:03:53.470> electric<00:03:53.890> fence

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:54.099 
the protection of that electric fence

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:56.190 
the protection of that electric fence
now<00:03:54.730> this<00:03:54.910> fall<00:03:55.180> when<00:03:55.510> it<00:03:55.599> becomes<00:03:55.900> hunting

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
now this fall when it becomes hunting

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.080 
now this fall when it becomes hunting
season<00:03:56.590> and<00:03:56.680> that's<00:03:56.980> a<00:03:57.190> an<00:03:57.280> established<00:03:57.879> food

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
season and that's a an established food

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.420 
season and that's a an established food
source<00:03:58.390> we<00:03:59.079> just<00:03:59.290> take<00:03:59.440> that<00:03:59.620> gate<00:03:59.920> down<00:04:00.129> where

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
source we just take that gate down where

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:01.800 
source we just take that gate down where
we<00:04:00.549> bring<00:04:00.730> the<00:04:00.790> tractor<00:04:01.180> in<00:04:01.450> and<00:04:01.569> out<00:04:01.660> to

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
we bring the tractor in and out to

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.210 
we bring the tractor in and out to
maintain<00:04:02.200> it<00:04:02.379> that's<00:04:02.829> going<00:04:03.040> to<00:04:03.099> be<00:04:03.190> a

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
maintain it that's going to be a

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.069 
maintain it that's going to be a
tremendous<00:04:03.430> bottleneck<00:04:04.299> for<00:04:04.540> hunting<00:04:04.930> I

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.079 
tremendous bottleneck for hunting I

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:08.430 
tremendous bottleneck for hunting I
can't<00:04:05.680> believe<00:04:06.099> how<00:04:06.910> well<00:04:06.940> a<00:04:07.599> two-foot<00:04:08.200> tall

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
can't believe how well a two-foot tall

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.009 
can't believe how well a two-foot tall
fence<00:04:08.769> that<00:04:08.980> I<00:04:09.160> can<00:04:09.579> jump<00:04:09.879> cut<00:04:10.480> the<00:04:10.599> deer<00:04:10.870> out

fence that I can jump cut the deer out

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:14.430 
fence that I can jump cut the deer out
in<00:04:11.200> these<00:04:11.290> harsh<00:04:11.590> conditions<00:04:12.220> I<00:04:13.440> can't

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
in these harsh conditions I can't

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.800 
in these harsh conditions I can't
imagine<00:04:14.560> a<00:04:14.980> better<00:04:15.010> test<00:04:15.609> than<00:04:16.180> having<00:04:16.539> lush

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
property and keeping deer out that's all

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.719 
property and keeping deer out that's all
the<00:04:22.330> testimony<00:04:22.900> I<00:04:23.020> need<00:04:23.350> to<00:04:23.860> know<00:04:24.010> that<00:04:24.250> system

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:24.729 
the testimony I need to know that system

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:33.779 
the testimony I need to know that system
works<00:04:24.970> and<00:04:25.300> works<00:04:25.630> well<00:04:31.950> now<00:04:32.950> come<00:04:33.190> fall<00:04:33.430> when

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:33.789 
works and works well now come fall when

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:35.520 
works and works well now come fall when
the<00:04:33.880> velvet<00:04:34.210> starts<00:04:34.510> cracking<00:04:34.990> and<00:04:35.139> shedding

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
the velvet starts cracking and shedding

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.920 
the velvet starts cracking and shedding
deer<00:04:36.190> are<00:04:36.430> driven<00:04:36.760> to<00:04:36.910> carbohydrates<00:04:37.750> they

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
deer are driven to carbohydrates they

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.020 
deer are driven to carbohydrates they
naturally<00:04:38.500> want<00:04:38.680> a<00:04:38.770> source<00:04:39.010> of<00:04:39.190> energy<00:04:39.400> and

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
naturally want a source of energy and

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.060 
naturally want a source of energy and
that's<00:04:40.240> when<00:04:40.510> deer<00:04:40.750> shift<00:04:41.110> from<00:04:41.260> green<00:04:41.560> forage

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
that's when deer shift from green forage

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.670 
that's when deer shift from green forage
to<00:04:42.340> what<00:04:42.820> I<00:04:42.849> call<00:04:43.150> brown<00:04:43.419> or<00:04:43.690> yellow<00:04:43.810> corn<00:04:44.320> or

to what I call brown or yellow corn or

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.320 
to what I call brown or yellow corn or
acorns<00:04:45.490> or<00:04:45.639> something<00:04:45.940> like<00:04:46.060> that

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
acorns or something like that

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.540 
acorns or something like that
we<00:04:47.110> had<00:04:47.229> a<00:04:47.260> really<00:04:47.530> tough<00:04:47.740> time<00:04:47.919> of<00:04:48.099> corn<00:04:48.340> this

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
we had a really tough time of corn this

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.760 
we had a really tough time of corn this
year<00:04:48.789> for<00:04:49.000> two<00:04:49.120> reasons<00:04:49.599> we<00:04:50.200> went<00:04:50.410> and<00:04:50.560> made

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
year for two reasons we went and made

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.100 
year for two reasons we went and made
from<00:04:51.070> really<00:04:51.460> cold<00:04:51.789> and<00:04:51.910> wet<00:04:52.120> to<00:04:52.419> hot<00:04:52.930> and

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
from really cold and wet to hot and

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:54.719 
from really cold and wet to hot and
dried<00:04:53.320> it<00:04:53.530> never<00:04:53.710> changed<00:04:54.220> so<00:04:54.340> a<00:04:54.370> lot<00:04:54.520> of<00:04:54.550> our

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:54.729 
dried it never changed so a lot of our

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:57.480 
dried it never changed so a lot of our
corn<00:04:55.000> didn't<00:04:55.360> do<00:04:55.450> too<00:04:55.690> well<00:04:55.770> but<00:04:56.770> in<00:04:56.889> June<00:04:57.099> when

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
corn didn't do too well but in June when

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.100 
corn didn't do too well but in June when
we<00:04:57.610> took<00:04:57.789> the<00:04:57.970> patches<00:04:58.510> that<00:04:58.539> didn't<00:04:58.990> have<00:04:59.080> a

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
we took the patches that didn't have a

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.500 
we took the patches that didn't have a
very<00:04:59.289> good<00:04:59.440> corn<00:04:59.830> stand<00:05:00.160> with<00:05:00.910> drilled<00:05:01.210> Milo

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510 
very good corn stand with drilled Milo

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.260 
very good corn stand with drilled Milo
in<00:05:01.870> so<00:05:02.530> I<00:05:02.560> don't<00:05:02.710> like<00:05:03.070> Milo<00:05:03.520> quite<00:05:03.849> as<00:05:04.000> well<00:05:04.210> as

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
in so I don't like Milo quite as well as

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.420 
in so I don't like Milo quite as well as
corn<00:05:04.570> for<00:05:04.840> two<00:05:04.990> reasons<00:05:05.500> it's<00:05:06.070> not<00:05:06.280> as

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 
corn for two reasons it's not as

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.550 
corn for two reasons it's not as

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
herbicide that means it stays active so

year<00:05:24.340> that's<00:05:24.580> just<00:05:24.789> one<00:05:25.060> example<00:05:25.240> but<00:05:25.900> on<00:05:26.560> the

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:26.680 
year that's just one example but on the

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.589 
year that's just one example but on the
areas<00:05:27.070> where<00:05:27.099> we<00:05:27.460> really<00:05:27.789> had<00:05:27.970> a<00:05:28.000> failure<00:05:28.389> and

areas where we really had a failure and
we<00:05:28.690> needed<00:05:28.870> something<00:05:29.200> we<00:05:29.919> plan<00:05:30.159> on<00:05:30.310> Milo

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:30.760 
we needed something we plan on Milo

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.279 
we needed something we plan on Milo
because<00:05:31.030> you<00:05:31.150> can<00:05:31.300> plant<00:05:31.570> it<00:05:31.719> late<00:05:32.080> in<00:05:32.200> the

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:32.289 
because you can plant it late in the

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:34.800 
because you can plant it late in the
summer<00:05:32.560> it's<00:05:33.190> very<00:05:33.340> drought<00:05:33.909> resistant

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810

and<00:05:34.930> dear<00:05:35.169> love<00:05:35.470> the<00:05:35.680> grain<00:05:35.919> on<00:05:36.250> top<00:05:36.669> of<00:05:36.850> Milo

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:41.740 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.680 

Milo<00:05:42.400> is<00:05:42.550> a<00:05:42.639> crop<00:05:42.880> we<00:05:43.030> haven't<00:05:43.270> talked<00:05:43.509> a<00:05:43.660> lot

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:43.690 
Milo is a crop we haven't talked a lot

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:46.320 
Milo is a crop we haven't talked a lot
about<00:05:43.930> I'm<00:05:44.320> going<00:05:44.560> to<00:05:44.680> your<00:05:44.830> TV<00:05:45.280> I<00:05:45.580> typically

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:46.330 
about I'm going to your TV I typically

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.120 
about I'm going to your TV I typically
prefer<00:05:46.539> corn<00:05:47.080> over<00:05:47.410> my<00:05:47.590> lobe

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.130 
prefer corn over my lobe

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:50.249 
prefer corn over my lobe
for<00:05:48.400> one<00:05:48.550> simple<00:05:48.820> reason<00:05:49.030> corn<00:05:49.660> makes<00:05:49.900> more

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:50.259 
for one simple reason corn makes more

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:53.310 
for one simple reason corn makes more
yield<00:05:50.740> per<00:05:51.220> acre<00:05:51.460> than<00:05:51.759> Milo<00:05:52.240> and<00:05:52.479> a<00:05:52.750> secondary

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:53.320 
yield per acre than Milo and a secondary

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.290 
yield per acre than Milo and a secondary
reason<00:05:53.620> is<00:05:53.889> when<00:05:54.039> that<00:05:54.160> cornea<00:05:54.639> ripens<00:05:55.120> it

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:55.300 
reason is when that cornea ripens it

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.170 
reason is when that cornea ripens it
falls<00:05:55.600> over<00:05:56.289> and<00:05:56.470> this<00:05:57.070> sheath<00:05:57.370> protects<00:05:58.000> the

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:58.180 
falls over and this sheath protects the

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.629 
falls over and this sheath protects the
grain<00:05:58.419> from<00:05:58.780> rain<00:05:59.020> and<00:05:59.050> mowed<00:05:59.650> it<00:06:00.220> even<00:06:00.490> keeps

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:00.639 
grain from rain and mowed it even keeps

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:03.540
