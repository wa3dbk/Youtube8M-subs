clay<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:45.360> I<00:00:45.390> can<00:00:45.690> compare<00:00:46.079> it<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.340> and<00:00:47.340> it's<00:00:48.149> a

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
clay that I can compare it to and it's a

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.060 
clay that I can compare it to and it's a
pretty<00:00:48.570> I<00:00:48.870> would<00:00:49.050> say<00:00:49.170> in<00:00:49.320> say<00:00:49.829> anywhere

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
pretty I would say in say anywhere

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.970 
pretty I would say in say anywhere
between<00:00:50.250> fine<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.090> ultrafine<00:00:51.530> clay<00:00:52.530> it's<00:00:52.800> not

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
between fine and ultrafine clay it's not

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.520 
between fine and ultrafine clay it's not
I<00:00:53.250> don't<00:00:53.489> think<00:00:53.670> it's<00:00:53.789> medium<00:00:54.239> it's<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:55.170> it's

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
I don't think it's medium it's a it's

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.830 
I don't think it's medium it's a it's
not<00:00:55.739> that<00:00:55.800> abrasive<00:00:56.610> so<00:00:57.090> that's<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.390> good

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
not that abrasive so that's a good

I<00:01:21.150> wouldn't<00:01:21.869> recommend<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.350> mean<00:01:22.530> version<00:01:22.770> I

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
I wouldn't recommend the mean version I

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.260 
I wouldn't recommend the mean version I
would<00:01:23.040> recommend<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.520> fine<00:01:23.729> version<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.240> one

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
would recommend the fine version the one

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.620 
would recommend the fine version the one
that<00:01:24.540> I<00:01:24.600> have<00:01:24.810> here<00:01:25.340> and<00:01:26.340> as<00:01:27.030> you<00:01:27.150> can<00:01:27.270> see<00:01:27.330> it's

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
that I have here and as you can see it's

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.969 
that I have here and as you can see it's
quite<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.900> bit<00:01:27.930> larger<00:01:28.229> so<00:01:30.350> you<00:01:31.350> know<00:01:31.470> when<00:01:31.950> I

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
quite a bit larger so you know when I

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.950 
quite a bit larger so you know when I
had<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.430> decide<00:01:32.700> which<00:01:32.909> one<00:01:33.119> was<00:01:33.240> 13<00:01:33.390> which<00:01:33.780> one

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
had to decide which one was 13 which one

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.260 
had to decide which one was 13 which one
50<00:01:34.380> it<00:01:34.500> was<00:01:34.590> a<00:01:34.619> little<00:01:34.860> bit<00:01:34.979> difficult<00:01:35.610> because

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
50 it was a little bit difficult because

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.819 
50 it was a little bit difficult because
this<00:01:37.049> far<00:01:37.320> is<00:01:37.619> not<00:01:37.920> too<00:01:38.189> expensive<00:01:38.640> um<00:01:39.829> using

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
this far is not too expensive um using

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.530 
this far is not too expensive um using
yet<00:01:41.100> some<00:01:41.310> of<00:01:41.400> my<00:01:41.460> bars<00:01:41.700> for<00:01:42.060> probably

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
yet some of my bars for probably

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.120 
yet some of my bars for probably
anywhere<00:01:42.960> between<00:01:43.020> five<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:43.470> ten<00:01:43.770> dollars

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
anywhere between five and ten dollars

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.310 
anywhere between five and ten dollars
and<00:01:44.310> this<00:01:45.030> was<00:01:45.689> $50<00:01:46.380> so<00:01:47.450> on<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.630> initial<00:01:49.110> price

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
and this was $50 so on the initial price

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.280 
and this was $50 so on the initial price
yeah<00:01:49.770> this<00:01:50.460> is<00:01:50.640> definitely<00:01:51.079> the<00:01:52.079> more

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
yeah this is definitely the more

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.620 
yeah this is definitely the more
expensive<00:01:52.619> version<00:01:52.829> than<00:01:53.549> this<00:01:53.729> but<00:01:54.360> if

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
expensive version than this but if

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.209 
expensive version than this but if
you're<00:01:54.780> going<00:01:54.899> to<00:01:54.990> be<00:01:55.079> cleaning<00:01:55.320> card<00:01:55.680> often

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
you're going to be cleaning card often

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.719 
you're going to be cleaning card often
enough<00:01:56.549> like<00:01:57.290> say<00:01:58.290> two<00:01:58.350> or<00:01:58.680> three<00:01:58.860> years<00:01:59.159> this

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
enough like say two or three years this

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.179 
enough like say two or three years this
actually<00:02:00.240> ends<00:02:00.420> up<00:02:00.630> becoming<00:02:00.810> less<00:02:01.500> expensive

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
actually ends up becoming less expensive

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.219 
actually ends up becoming less expensive
over<00:02:02.549> time<00:02:02.579> because<00:02:03.479> you<00:02:03.600> can<00:02:03.780> keep<00:02:04.020> on

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
over time because you can keep on

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.870 
over time because you can keep on
reusing<00:02:04.710> it<00:02:04.979> whereas<00:02:05.310> you<00:02:05.369> have<00:02:05.579> to<00:02:05.700> throw

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
reusing it whereas you have to throw

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.830 
reusing it whereas you have to throw
this<00:02:06.060> guy<00:02:06.299> away<00:02:06.509> so<00:02:08.209> while<00:02:09.209> I'm<00:02:09.420> going<00:02:09.569> to<00:02:09.629> say

can see the dirt in there and you can

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:09.750 
can see the dirt in there and you can
tell<00:04:07.390> it's<00:04:07.629> time<00:04:07.810> to<00:04:08.019> Brie<00:04:08.200> need<00:04:08.470> over<00:04:08.829> here

you don't see anything you just see the

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:18.569 
you don't see anything you just see the
brown<00:04:15.660> so<00:04:16.660> I<00:04:17.199> would<00:04:17.680> say<00:04:17.799> that's<00:04:18.010> a<00:04:18.130> pretty<00:04:18.340> big

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
brown so I would say that's a pretty big

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:20.670 
brown so I would say that's a pretty big
difference<00:04:18.760> you<00:04:19.389> you<00:04:19.810> know<00:04:19.959> when<00:04:20.169> the<00:04:20.260> need<00:04:20.500> on

difference you you know when the need on

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.830 
difference you you know when the need on
this<00:04:21.310> versus<00:04:21.789> you<00:04:21.910> don't<00:04:22.150> know<00:04:22.300> what<00:04:22.449> need<00:04:22.690> on

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
this versus you don't know what need on

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.730 
this versus you don't know what need on

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
that as far as feel both of them played

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.010 
that as far as feel both of them played
pretty<00:04:27.130> well<00:04:27.250> I<00:04:27.669> mean<00:04:27.910> both<00:04:28.419> of<00:04:28.630> them<00:04:28.720> you<00:04:28.870> can

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
pretty well I mean both of them you can

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.210 
pretty well I mean both of them you can
feel<00:04:29.490> both<00:04:30.490> of<00:04:30.669> them<00:04:30.820> pretty<00:04:31.360> slick<00:04:31.840> a<00:04:32.220> tactile

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
feel both of them pretty slick a tactile

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.060 
feel both of them pretty slick a tactile
feel<00:04:33.520> is<00:04:33.729> good<00:04:34.030> on<00:04:34.150> both<00:04:34.360> of<00:04:34.479> them<00:04:34.949> when<00:04:35.949> you're

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
feel is good on both of them when you're

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.469 
feel is good on both of them when you're
rubbing<00:04:36.400> it<00:04:36.520> you<00:04:36.639> can<00:04:36.789> feel<00:04:37.000> when<00:04:37.180> there's<00:04:37.330> the

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:37.479 
rubbing it you can feel when there's the

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:39.510 
rubbing it you can feel when there's the
above<00:04:37.750> surface<00:04:38.050> contaminant<00:04:38.889> and<00:04:39.039> you<00:04:39.370> can

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
above surface contaminant and you can

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.310 
above surface contaminant and you can
feel<00:04:39.729> when<00:04:40.000> they're<00:04:40.419> not<00:04:40.600> there<00:04:40.810> anymore<00:04:41.050> and

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
feel when they're not there anymore and

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.920 
feel when they're not there anymore and
they're<00:04:41.530> embedded<00:04:42.039> in<00:04:42.250> the<00:04:42.310> clay<00:04:42.550> and<00:04:42.780> you<00:04:43.780> get

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
they're embedded in the clay and you get

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.629 
they're embedded in the clay and you get
the<00:04:44.050> exact<00:04:44.350> same<00:04:44.530> feeling<00:04:45.010> the<00:04:45.130> same<00:04:45.310> exact

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:45.639 
the exact same feeling the same exact

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:50.760 
the exact same feeling the same exact
tactile<00:04:46.060> feeling<00:04:46.419> with<00:04:46.990> this<00:04:47.169> towel<00:04:49.740> so<00:04:50.740> I

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
tactile feeling with this towel so I

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.469 
tactile feeling with this towel so I
mean<00:04:51.130> this<00:04:51.340> is<00:04:51.550> pretty<00:04:51.760> much<00:04:51.880> going<00:04:52.060> to<00:04:52.210> be<00:04:52.270> my

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479 
mean this is pretty much going to be my

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:58.020 
mean this is pretty much going to be my
conclusion<00:04:52.690> both<00:04:53.650> work<00:04:53.919> well<00:04:54.300> I<00:04:56.310> mean<00:04:57.310> I'd<00:04:57.970> say

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
conclusion both work well I mean I'd say

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.300 
conclusion both work well I mean I'd say
the<00:04:58.449> biggest<00:04:58.630> advantage<00:04:59.110> is<00:04:59.320> the<00:04:59.830> visual

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
the biggest advantage is the visual

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.550 
the biggest advantage is the visual
advantage<00:05:00.880> to<00:05:01.449> clay<00:05:01.720> that's<00:05:02.229> the<00:05:02.380> biggest

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
advantage to clay that's the biggest

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.529 
advantage to clay that's the biggest
advantage<00:05:02.710> for<00:05:03.160> clay<00:05:03.430> I<00:05:03.699> say<00:05:04.210> the<00:05:04.360> biggest

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:04.539 
advantage for clay I say the biggest

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:07.050 
advantage for clay I say the biggest
advantage<00:05:05.169> for<00:05:05.740> the<00:05:06.070> speedy<00:05:06.310> prep<00:05:06.580> towel<00:05:06.820> is

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
advantage for the speedy prep towel is

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.870 
advantage for the speedy prep towel is
the<00:05:07.630> fact<00:05:07.840> that<00:05:07.900> it's<00:05:08.080> quick<00:05:08.400> that<00:05:09.400> you<00:05:09.430> can<00:05:09.729> go

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880 
the fact that it's quick that you can go

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.200 
the fact that it's quick that you can go
over<00:05:09.910> a<00:05:10.270> bigger<00:05:10.570> surface<00:05:10.930> I<00:05:11.860> know<00:05:12.699> I<00:05:12.849> probably

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
over a bigger surface I know I probably

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.480 
over a bigger surface I know I probably
I'm<00:05:13.900> probably<00:05:14.560> going<00:05:14.830> to<00:05:14.889> speed<00:05:15.160> up<00:05:15.190> the<00:05:15.370> video

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
I'm probably going to speed up the video

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:20.250 
I'm probably going to speed up the video

the same area of the trunk as it did for

the same area of the trunk as it did for
me<00:05:29.289> with<00:05:29.440> clay<00:05:29.680> and<00:05:29.860> that's<00:05:30.430> not<00:05:30.610> including

me with clay and that's not including

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:34.020 
me with clay and that's not including
the<00:05:31.120> time<00:05:31.389> that<00:05:32.110> you<00:05:32.260> would<00:05:32.409> have<00:05:32.560> to<00:05:33.030> read

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.030 
the time that you would have to read

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:35.939 
the time that you would have to read
this<00:05:34.240> clay<00:05:34.510> because<00:05:35.199> you<00:05:35.349> don't<00:05:35.530> want<00:05:35.710> to<00:05:35.770> use

00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:35.949 
this clay because you don't want to use

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:37.140 
this clay because you don't want to use
this<00:05:36.130> clay<00:05:36.340> now<00:05:36.550> that<00:05:36.760> there's<00:05:36.970> the

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.150 
this clay now that there's the

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.750 
this clay now that there's the
contaminants<00:05:37.750> on<00:05:37.900> it<00:05:38.050> so<00:05:38.520> including<00:05:39.520> the<00:05:39.729> the

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:39.760 
contaminants on it so including the the

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.080 
contaminants on it so including the the
kneading<00:05:40.539> part<00:05:40.960> of<00:05:41.169> the<00:05:41.349> clay<00:05:41.620> the<00:05:42.159> towel

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.090 
kneading part of the clay the towel

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.240 
kneading part of the clay the towel
where<00:05:43.720> it's<00:05:43.870> much<00:05:44.080> much<00:05:44.289> faster<00:05:44.740> because<00:05:44.949> all

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.250 
where it's much much faster because all

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:46.710 
where it's much much faster because all
you<00:05:45.370> got<00:05:45.490> to<00:05:45.580> do<00:05:45.669> is<00:05:45.789> flip<00:05:46.000> to<00:05:46.150> another<00:05:46.180> side

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720 
you got to do is flip to another side

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.689 
you got to do is flip to another side
now<00:05:47.260> of<00:05:47.380> course<00:05:47.560> you<00:05:47.740> have<00:05:47.860> to<00:05:47.979> rinse<00:05:48.159> it<00:05:48.430> when

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:48.699 
now of course you have to rinse it when

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:50.580 
now of course you have to rinse it when
all<00:05:48.970> four<00:05:49.300> signs<00:05:49.539> have<00:05:49.720> been<00:05:49.750> used<00:05:50.110> but<00:05:50.530> that

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:50.590 
all four signs have been used but that

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.200 
all four signs have been used but that
I've<00:05:50.949> done<00:05:51.099> that<00:05:51.159> before<00:05:51.580> and<00:05:51.610> that<00:05:51.789> literally

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.210 
I've done that before and that literally

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:54.750 
I've done that before and that literally
takes<00:05:52.570> no<00:05:52.840> more<00:05:52.990> than<00:05:53.050> 10<00:05:53.380> seconds<00:05:53.770> whereas

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:54.760 
takes no more than 10 seconds whereas

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.370 
takes no more than 10 seconds whereas
claying<00:05:55.090> you<00:05:55.270> probably<00:05:55.570> have<00:05:55.780> to<00:05:55.870> do<00:05:55.990> on<00:05:56.169> every

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:56.380 
claying you probably have to do on every

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:00.180 
claying you probably have to do on every
panel<00:05:56.880> so<00:05:57.990> well<00:05:58.990> with<00:05:59.110> my<00:05:59.260> conclusion<00:05:59.889> be<00:06:00.010> my

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:00.190 
panel so well with my conclusion be my

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:01.650 
panel so well with my conclusion be my
my<00:06:00.580> final<00:06:01.210> line

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:01.660 
my final line

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:04.230 
my final line
would<00:06:01.780> be<00:06:01.960> I<00:06:02.530> think<00:06:03.250> the<00:06:03.520> speedy<00:06:03.760> prep<00:06:04.030> towel

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:04.240 
would be I think the speedy prep towel

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.750 
would be I think the speedy prep towel
is<00:06:04.450> worth<00:06:04.660> it<00:06:04.840> if<00:06:05.160> if<00:06:06.160> you're<00:06:06.490> going<00:06:06.580> to<00:06:06.670> be

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:06.760 
is worth it if if you're going to be

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.910 
is worth it if if you're going to be
claimed<00:06:07.000> I<00:06:07.210> mean<00:06:07.690> if<00:06:07.900> you<00:06:08.050> plan<00:06:08.380> on<00:06:08.410> Klein<00:06:08.710> for

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:08.920

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:11.000 
claimed I mean if you plan on Klein for
quite<00:06:09.220> a<00:06:09.250> while

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:11.010 
quite a while

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:14.010 
quite a while
you<00:06:12.010> know<00:06:12.130> I<00:06:12.340> then<00:06:12.910> there's<00:06:13.420> no<00:06:13.600> reason<00:06:13.990> you

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:14.020 
you know I then there's no reason you

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.200 
you know I then there's no reason you
shouldn't<00:06:14.320> just<00:06:14.680> invest<00:06:15.190> in<00:06:15.460> the<00:06:15.940> beginning

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:16.210 
shouldn't just invest in the beginning
