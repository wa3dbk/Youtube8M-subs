just being involved in that just really

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:46.649 
just being involved in that just really

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
appealed to me and that's why I did it

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:48.419 
appealed to me and that's why I did it
and<00:01:46.810> I<00:01:46.869> did<00:01:47.380> eight<00:01:47.649> weeks<00:01:47.859> on<00:01:48.069> or<00:01:48.159> whatever<00:01:48.279> I

00:01:48.419 --> 00:01:48.429 
and I did eight weeks on or whatever I

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:51.209 
and I did eight weeks on or whatever I
was<00:01:48.969> so<00:01:49.299> into<00:01:49.990> it<00:01:50.020> like<00:01:50.229> I<00:01:50.349> really<00:01:50.679> enjoyed<00:01:51.039> it

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:51.219 
was so into it like I really enjoyed it

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:54.059 
was so into it like I really enjoyed it
and<00:01:51.310> understood<00:01:52.240> what<00:01:53.139> that<00:01:53.169> art<00:01:53.619> form<00:01:53.889> was

00:01:54.059 --> 00:01:54.069 
and understood what that art form was

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:56.819 
and understood what that art form was
all<00:01:54.189> about<00:01:54.429> so<00:01:54.729> it<00:01:55.359> does<00:01:55.689> take<00:01:55.719> an<00:01:56.349> element<00:01:56.649> of

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:56.829 
all about so it does take an element of

00:01:56.829 --> 00:01:58.620 
all about so it does take an element of
fearlessness<00:01:57.189> to<00:01:57.729> step<00:01:58.179> away<00:01:58.299> from<00:01:58.450> the

fearlessness to step away from the
comfort<00:01:59.079> zone<00:01:59.399> but<00:02:00.399> that's<00:02:00.579> why<00:02:00.759> I<00:02:00.789> have<00:02:00.999> no<00:02:01.179> no

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:01.419

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
nobody was given a script back then you

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.600 
nobody was given a script back then you
just<00:03:13.440> said<00:03:13.680> what<00:03:13.950> you<00:03:13.980> thought<00:03:14.070> would<00:03:14.430> work

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
just said what you thought would work

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.040 
just said what you thought would work
and<00:03:14.820> if<00:03:14.910> it<00:03:15.000> caught<00:03:15.239> on<00:03:15.270> then<00:03:15.600> you<00:03:15.690> just<00:03:15.840> go

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
and if it caught on then you just go

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.110 
and if it caught on then you just go
with<00:03:16.230> it<00:03:16.410> it's<00:03:17.010> not<00:03:17.190> like<00:03:17.370> that<00:03:17.400> anymore<00:03:17.640> and

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
with it it's not like that anymore and

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.940 
with it it's not like that anymore and
it's<00:03:18.690> not<00:03:18.870> bad<00:03:19.110> or<00:03:19.320> good<00:03:19.410> it's<00:03:19.590> just<00:03:19.709> the<00:03:19.830> way

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
it's not bad or good it's just the way

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.789 
it's not bad or good it's just the way
it<00:03:20.070> is<00:03:20.100> the<00:03:20.519> sport<00:03:20.790> has<00:03:20.910> changed<00:03:21.680> so<00:03:22.680> there

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
it is the sport has changed so there

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:24.380 
it is the sport has changed so there
isn't<00:03:23.160> any<00:03:23.310> money<00:03:23.700> there's<00:03:24.000> not<00:03:24.180> a<00:03:24.209> lot<00:03:24.360> of

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
isn't any money there's not a lot of

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.810 
isn't any money there's not a lot of
room<00:03:24.570> to<00:03:24.600> take<00:03:24.810> a<00:03:24.870> chance<00:03:25.170> and<00:03:25.500> I<00:03:26.370> think<00:03:26.610> that's

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
room to take a chance and I think that's

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.750 
room to take a chance and I think that's
gonna<00:03:27.290> hurt<00:03:28.290> a<00:03:28.440> lot<00:03:28.560> of<00:03:28.739> guys<00:03:28.890> because<00:03:29.370> it's<00:03:29.549> so

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
gonna hurt a lot of guys because it's so

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.400 
gonna hurt a lot of guys because it's so
regimented<00:03:30.180> and<00:03:30.510> what<00:03:30.630> you<00:03:30.780> have<00:03:30.870> to<00:03:30.989> do<00:03:31.170> and

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
regimented and what you have to do and

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.350 
regimented and what you have to do and
everything<00:03:32.190> has<00:03:32.370> to<00:03:32.519> be<00:03:32.580> kind<00:03:32.820> of<00:03:32.880> spelled<00:03:33.239> out

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
everything has to be kind of spelled out

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.640 
everything has to be kind of spelled out
and<00:03:33.510> drawn<00:03:33.690> out<00:03:33.720> and<00:03:34.019> that's<00:03:34.080> not<00:03:34.290> really<00:03:34.350> what

the<00:03:57.540> Brazil<00:03:57.930> thing<00:03:58.140> it's<00:03:58.380> just<00:03:58.530> something

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
the Brazil thing it's just something

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.110 
the Brazil thing it's just something
that<00:03:58.860> we've<00:03:59.070> done<00:03:59.250> for<00:03:59.280> years<00:03:59.549> and<00:03:59.850> years<00:03:59.910> and

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
that we've done for years and years and

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.250 
that we've done for years and years and
years<00:04:00.269> and<00:04:00.450> no<00:04:00.600> one<00:04:00.720> else<00:04:00.900> on<00:04:01.080> the<00:04:01.140> roster

years and no one else on the roster

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.080 
years and no one else on the roster
probably<00:04:01.830> would<00:04:01.920> have<00:04:01.980> done<00:04:02.160> that<00:04:02.340> and<00:04:02.580> that's

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
probably would have done that and that's

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.690 
probably would have done that and that's
threes<00:04:03.420> and<00:04:03.630> why<00:04:03.780> but<00:04:04.410> I'm<00:04:04.560> not<00:04:04.739> embarrassed

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
threes and why but I'm not embarrassed

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.449 
threes and why but I'm not embarrassed
or<00:04:05.880> ashamed<00:04:06.120> about<00:04:06.720> it<00:04:06.989> it's<00:04:07.230> it<00:04:08.040> is<00:04:08.190> what<00:04:08.370> it

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
or ashamed about it it's it is what it

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:09.949 
or ashamed about it it's it is what it
is<00:04:08.489> and<00:04:08.610> it's<00:04:08.880> where<00:04:09.120> I<00:04:09.150> came<00:04:09.239> from<00:04:09.450> and<00:04:09.720> part

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
is and it's where I came from and part

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
of my you know of my character Mike you

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.960 
of my you know of my character Mike you
know<00:04:12.900> wrestling<00:04:13.560> upbringing<00:04:14.070> but<00:04:14.670> I<00:04:14.730> think<00:04:14.940> a

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
know wrestling upbringing but I think a

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.960 
know wrestling upbringing but I think a
lot<00:04:15.120> of<00:04:15.150> guys<00:04:15.890> if<00:04:16.890> they<00:04:17.220> could<00:04:17.400> take<00:04:17.609> a<00:04:17.640> chance

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
lot of guys if they could take a chance

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:19.610 
lot of guys if they could take a chance
and<00:04:18.269> had<00:04:18.570> a<00:04:18.600> little<00:04:18.840> bit<00:04:18.959> more<00:04:19.079> confidence

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
and had a little bit more confidence

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.259 
and had a little bit more confidence
could<00:04:19.859> probably<00:04:20.100> do<00:04:20.280> better<00:04:20.430> but<00:04:20.640> it's<00:04:20.940> hard

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
could probably do better but it's hard

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:22.580 
could probably do better but it's hard
to<00:04:21.329> get<00:04:21.479> confidence<00:04:21.959> when<00:04:22.049> you<00:04:22.140> always<00:04:22.380> have

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
to get confidence when you always have

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.469 
to get confidence when you always have
