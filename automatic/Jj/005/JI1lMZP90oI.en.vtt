easiest way to sum up my thoughts is

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.180 
easiest way to sum up my thoughts is
kind<00:00:36.780> of<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:36.989> cop-out<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.620> that<00:00:37.770> would<00:00:37.890> be<00:00:38.040> to

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
kind of a cop-out and that would be to

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.040 
kind of a cop-out and that would be to
say<00:00:38.370> it's<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.730> cool<00:00:38.879> of<00:00:39.000> duty<00:00:39.239> gift<00:00:39.480> so<00:00:39.750> it's

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
say it's a cool of duty gift so it's

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.869 
say it's a cool of duty gift so it's
really<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.860> same<00:00:40.890> as<00:00:41.129> most<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.579> other<00:00:41.700> games

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.310 
really the same as most the other games
I<00:00:42.000> figured<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.450> moon<00:00:42.600> would<00:00:42.780> add<00:00:42.899> a<00:00:42.930> lot<00:00:43.260> to

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
I figured the moon would add a lot to

I figured the moon would add a lot to
the<00:00:43.530> game<00:00:43.680> like<00:00:43.890> really<00:00:44.340> change<00:00:44.579> it<00:00:44.670> up<00:00:44.760> it

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
the game like really change it up it

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.400 
the game like really change it up it
doesn't<00:00:45.149> change<00:00:45.360> up<00:00:45.539> as<00:00:45.660> much<00:00:45.780> like<00:00:45.989> lake<00:00:46.230> but

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
doesn't change up as much like lake but

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.440 
doesn't change up as much like lake but
it<00:00:46.500> does<00:00:46.680> add<00:00:46.710> so<00:00:47.250> many<00:00:47.430> cooler<00:00:47.850> than<00:00:48.059> select

impressions<00:01:21.450> game<00:01:22.350> is<00:01:22.530> good<00:01:22.830> but<00:01:23.159> it's<00:01:23.340> not<00:01:23.460> a

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
impressions game is good but it's not a

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.820 
impressions game is good but it's not a
radical<00:01:24.450> change<00:01:24.750> so<00:01:25.259> far<00:01:25.500> I<00:01:25.560> haven't<00:01:25.680> even

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
radical change so far I haven't even

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.320 
radical change so far I haven't even
campaign<00:01:26.280> yet<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.640> I'm<00:01:26.880> assuming<00:01:27.210> that's

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
campaign yet and I'm assuming that's

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.210 
campaign yet and I'm assuming that's
gonna<00:01:27.570> be<00:01:27.750> like<00:01:27.990> an<00:01:28.140> actual<00:01:28.290> fund<00:01:28.680> campaign<00:01:29.100> so

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
gonna be like an actual fund campaign so

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.859 
gonna be like an actual fund campaign so

some new stuff but it's not really

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.630 
some new stuff but it's not really
enough<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:36.720> be<00:01:36.990> considered<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:38.549> know

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
enough to be considered the you know

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.219 
enough to be considered the you know
kind<00:01:38.850> of<00:01:38.880> evolution<00:01:39.540> on<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.750> franchise<00:01:39.990> that

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
kind of evolution on the franchise that

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.050 
kind of evolution on the franchise that

earth assault waves in this game it's
one<00:01:54.390> of<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.689> kind<00:01:54.930> of<00:01:54.990> bridges<00:01:55.470> between<00:01:55.619> st

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
one of the kind of bridges between st

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.560 
one of the kind of bridges between st
clear<00:01:56.430> soul<00:01:56.640> rebels<00:01:57.000> because<00:01:57.270> it<00:01:57.420> has<00:01:57.540> a

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
clear soul rebels because it has a

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.929 
clear soul rebels because it has a
reasonably<00:01:58.200> high<00:01:58.229> fire<00:01:58.680> rate<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:59.189> has<00:01:59.430> quite<00:01:59.820> a

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
reasonably high fire rate it has quite a

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.429 
reasonably high fire rate it has quite a
bit<00:02:00.180> of<00:02:00.270> recoil<00:02:00.570> so<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:00.899> know<00:02:00.990> we<00:02:01.170> have<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.350> do

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
bit of recoil so you know we have to do

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.350 
bit of recoil so you know we have to do
long-range<00:02:01.860> shots<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.850> it<00:02:02.969> has<00:02:03.060> quite<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.329> bit

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
long-range shots and it has quite a bit

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.149 
long-range shots and it has quite a bit
of<00:02:03.479> damage<00:02:03.540> so<00:02:04.020> up<00:02:04.200> close<00:02:04.229> you<00:02:04.500> can<00:02:04.920> kind<00:02:05.130> of

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
of damage so up close you can kind of

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.980 
of damage so up close you can kind of
destroy<00:02:05.520> people<00:02:05.909> with<00:02:06.030> hip<00:02:06.299> fire<00:02:06.509> or<00:02:06.630> not<00:02:06.810> and

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
use this weapon you can see in this game

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.509 
use this weapon you can see in this game
play<00:02:15.439> in<00:02:15.530> the<00:02:15.620> background<00:02:15.829> it's<00:02:16.219> pretty<00:02:16.370> nice

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
play in the background it's pretty nice

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:18.640 
play in the background it's pretty nice
can<00:02:16.760> take<00:02:16.909> time<00:02:17.090> I'm<00:02:17.209> saying<00:02:17.480> that<00:02:18.260> I<00:02:18.290> use<00:02:18.620> a

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
can take time I'm saying that I use a

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.160 
can take time I'm saying that I use a
silencer<00:02:19.219> and<00:02:19.700> the<00:02:20.299> yeah<00:02:20.689> i<00:02:20.719> think<00:02:20.900> it's<00:02:21.109> like

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
silencer and the yeah i think it's like

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.140 
silencer and the yeah i think it's like
the<00:02:21.409> parabellum<00:02:22.280> microphone<00:02:22.670> or<00:02:22.790> something

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
the parabellum microphone or something

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.970 
the parabellum microphone or something
it<00:02:23.629> basically<00:02:23.749> makes<00:02:24.049> other<00:02:24.319> people<00:02:24.499> silence

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
it basically makes other people silence

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.559 
it basically makes other people silence
does<00:02:25.129> not<00:02:25.310> work<00:02:25.549> and<00:02:25.760> the<00:02:26.150> funny<00:02:26.329> thing<00:02:26.389> about

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
does not work and the funny thing about

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.119 
does not work and the funny thing about
these<00:02:26.840> two<00:02:27.019> attachments<00:02:27.439> together<00:02:27.709> is<00:02:27.920> that

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:28.129 
these two attachments together is that

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:29.979 
these two attachments together is that
someone<00:02:28.400> else<00:02:28.519> uses<00:02:28.939> the<00:02:29.060> exact<00:02:29.329> same<00:02:29.540> two<00:02:29.810> we

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
someone else uses the exact same two we

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.140 
someone else uses the exact same two we
basically<00:02:30.290> have<00:02:30.500> no<00:02:30.680> attachments<00:02:31.189> each<00:02:31.340> but

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
basically have no attachments each but

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.009 
basically have no attachments each but
there's<00:02:32.299> just<00:02:32.359> something<00:02:32.480> kind<00:02:32.689> of<00:02:32.870> bringing

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
there's just something kind of bringing

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.500 
there's just something kind of bringing
about<00:02:33.139> having<00:02:33.620> you<00:02:33.889> know<00:02:33.980> no<00:02:34.189> audio<00:02:34.489> book<00:02:34.939> not
