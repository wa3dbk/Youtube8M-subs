this mod actually does is it produces a
new<00:00:37.890> or<00:00:38.129> called<00:00:38.730> random<00:00:39.239> I'd<00:00:39.390> now<00:00:39.989> when<00:00:40.200> you

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
new or called random I'd now when you

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.670 
new or called random I'd now when you
mind<00:00:40.739> this<00:00:41.040> block<00:00:41.690> instead<00:00:42.690> of<00:00:42.960> getting<00:00:43.379> like

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
mind this block instead of getting like

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.700 
mind this block instead of getting like
a<00:00:44.030> specific<00:00:45.030> thing<00:00:45.660> where<00:00:46.200> you'll<00:00:46.320> get<00:00:46.500> is<00:00:46.680> a

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
a specific thing where you'll get is a

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.950 
a specific thing where you'll get is a
random<00:00:47.370> item<00:00:48.000> item<00:00:48.510> or<00:00:48.629> so<00:00:49.469> you<00:00:50.340> could<00:00:50.520> get

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
random item item or so you could get

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.389 
random item item or so you could get
emeralds<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:52.110> could<00:00:52.320> get<00:00:52.500> gold<00:00:52.829> you<00:00:53.100> can<00:00:53.129> get

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
emeralds you could get gold you can get

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.000 
emeralds you could get gold you can get
diamonds<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:54.300> could<00:00:54.480> get<00:00:54.660> ironed<00:00:55.170> you<00:00:55.860> can

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
diamonds you could get ironed you can

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.099 
diamonds you could get ironed you can
get<00:00:56.160> redstone<00:00:57.320> so<00:00:58.320> it's<00:00:58.680> quite<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:58.920> interesting

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:00.109 
get redstone so it's quite a interesting

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:04.130 
get redstone so it's quite a interesting
little<00:01:01.579> mud<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:02.910> it<00:01:03.329> can<00:01:03.480> add<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:03.750> bit<00:01:03.989> of

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
little mud and it can add a bit of

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.300 
little mud and it can add a bit of
randomness<00:01:06.049> now<00:01:07.049> how<00:01:07.229> this<00:01:07.470> one<00:01:07.710> does<00:01:08.010> differ

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
randomness now how this one does differ

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.940 
randomness now how this one does differ
from<00:01:08.580> other<00:01:09.119> versions<00:01:09.869> is<00:01:10.080> you<00:01:10.650> can<00:01:10.799> actually

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
from other versions is you can actually

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.940 
from other versions is you can actually
use<00:01:11.670> different<00:01:12.270> texture<00:01:12.750> packs<00:01:12.990> with<00:01:13.740> this

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
use different texture packs with this

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.359 
use different texture packs with this
mod<00:01:14.189> without<00:01:14.970> it<00:01:15.270> going<00:01:15.869> all<00:01:16.439> weird<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.280> stuff

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
mod without it going all weird and stuff

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.330 
mod without it going all weird and stuff
like<00:01:17.729> that<00:01:17.990> plus<00:01:18.990> if<00:01:19.290> you're<00:01:19.619> using<00:01:19.890> another

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
like that plus if you're using another

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.359 
like that plus if you're using another
mod<00:01:20.610> that<00:01:20.790> creates<00:01:21.299> like<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:22.020> nother<00:01:23.009> block

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
mod that creates like a nother block

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.170 
mod that creates like a nother block
let's<00:01:23.729> say<00:01:24.470> using<00:01:25.470> one<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:25.979> creates<00:01:26.729> an

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
let's say using one that creates an

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.480 
let's say using one that creates an
Iridium<00:01:28.100> or<00:01:29.540> then

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
Iridium or then

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.760 
Iridium or then
you<00:01:33.479> will<00:01:33.600> have<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.840> chance<00:01:34.140> of<00:01:34.259> getting<00:01:34.619> that

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
you will have a chance of getting that

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.850 
you will have a chance of getting that
