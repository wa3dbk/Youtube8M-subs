painted<00:00:24.660> all<00:00:24.779> these<00:00:24.900> wave<00:00:25.230> crests<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:25.920> the

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
painted all these wave crests and the

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.359 
painted all these wave crests and the
idea<00:00:27.119> was<00:00:27.180> that<00:00:27.480> we<00:00:28.109> wanted<00:00:28.650> to<00:00:28.920> have<00:00:29.099> the

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
idea was that we wanted to have the

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.120 
idea was that we wanted to have the
gesture<00:00:29.910> of<00:00:29.939> water<00:00:30.570> and<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.769> fact<00:00:32.040> that

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
gesture of water and the the fact that

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.549 
gesture of water and the the fact that
water<00:00:32.489> is<00:00:32.790> alive<00:00:33.149> so<00:00:33.600> we<00:00:33.719> wanted<00:00:34.020> all<00:00:34.200> the

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
water is alive so we wanted all the

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.680 
water is alive so we wanted all the
prints<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.280> really<00:00:35.640> kind<00:00:35.820> of<00:00:35.880> come<00:00:36.059> alive<00:00:36.360> and

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
prints to really kind of come alive and

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.290 
prints to really kind of come alive and
that<00:00:36.780> you<00:00:36.930> would<00:00:37.050> see<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.530> movement<00:00:38.300> and

that you would see the movement and

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:49.160 
that you would see the movement and
that's<00:00:39.629> where<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.870> prints<00:00:40.110> came<00:00:40.230> from<00:00:48.170> the

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170

pulsating a bit more visceral actually

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.749 
pulsating a bit more visceral actually
than<00:01:37.140> their<00:01:37.560> normal<00:01:37.590> collections<00:01:38.430> I<00:01:38.579> think

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
than their normal collections I think

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.340 
than their normal collections I think
they're<00:01:38.909> really<00:01:39.030> evolving<00:01:39.600> their<00:01:39.810> aesthetic

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
they're really evolving their aesthetic

very very Japanese I think inspiration

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.060 
very very Japanese I think inspiration
as<00:01:57.240> you<00:01:57.390> could<00:01:57.570> tell<00:01:57.720> is<00:01:57.869> saving<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.289> water<00:01:58.619> so

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
as you could tell is saving the water so

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.399 
as you could tell is saving the water so
we<00:01:59.189> did<00:01:59.369> a<00:01:59.399> research<00:01:59.820> in<00:02:00.240> what<00:02:00.570> we<00:02:00.719> could<00:02:00.929> do<00:02:01.140> in

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
we did a research in what we could do in

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.999 
we did a research in what we could do in
indore<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.429> we<00:02:02.880> came<00:02:03.060> up<00:02:03.119> with<00:02:04.079> we<00:02:04.560> proposed

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
indore and we came up with we proposed

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.020 
indore and we came up with we proposed
first<00:02:05.939> their<00:02:06.299> water<00:02:06.630> curtain<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.470> then<00:02:08.160> we

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
first their water curtain and then we

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.360 
first their water curtain and then we
decided<00:02:09.539> to<00:02:09.750> work<00:02:09.929> on<00:02:10.200> an<00:02:10.349> installation<00:02:11.160> with

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
decided to work on an installation with

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.490 
decided to work on an installation with
Carolyn<00:02:11.790> Umberto<00:02:12.060> we<00:02:12.300> did<00:02:12.450> a<00:02:12.480> test<00:02:12.810> with<00:02:13.080> one

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
Carolyn Umberto we did a test with one

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.160 
Carolyn Umberto we did a test with one
speaker<00:02:14.040> and<00:02:14.220> water<00:02:14.459> with<00:02:15.239> us<00:02:15.390> test<00:02:15.750> and<00:02:16.019> then

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
speaker and water with us test and then

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.870 
speaker and water with us test and then
we<00:02:16.410> decided<00:02:16.769> to<00:02:16.950> multiply<00:02:17.459> it<00:02:17.519> at<00:02:17.819> the

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
we decided to multiply it at the

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.960 
we decided to multiply it at the
beginning<00:02:18.120> it<00:02:18.180> was<00:02:18.330> like<00:02:18.510> 40<00:02:19.410> 60<00:02:19.920> 80<00:02:20.310> and<00:02:20.610> we

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
beginning it was like 40 60 80 and we

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.470 
beginning it was like 40 60 80 and we
ended<00:02:21.209> up<00:02:21.360> with<00:02:21.599> 200<00:02:22.170> of<00:02:22.319> them
