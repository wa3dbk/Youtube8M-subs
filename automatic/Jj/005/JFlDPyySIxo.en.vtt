00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.470
 It was a normal day like any other 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.810
 I was with my friends from the set 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.029

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.730
 and it will be for everyone but for me 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:37.010
 he was famous since that damn day he 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.110
 called agar I was where you had to 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.120
 eat little balls to make yourself 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.790
 bigger and eat the users that 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.720
 they are smaller than you to me always 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:49.010
 they ate that bothered me a lot 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.500
 we were playing normal when 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.840
 Suddenly that was making me bigger 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.900
 it was the best day of my life good 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.570
 was going to be I was in the first place 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:02.239
 and we jumped for joy until it happened 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:05.000
 something weird everyone who was in the 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:07.940
 put third room and so on 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.740
 they had disappeared, only someone was left 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:16.460
 second someone called marlon 666 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:18.979
 we were scared to see the 666 but not 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:23.000
 we are important but what is not 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:25.790
 We knew that this marlon 666 had 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.280
 created the game he had on the ball 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.930
 a red face blurred but again not 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.450
 we take importance 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.820
 until it was growing growing and 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.880
 growing so much that I take my job 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:40.250
 1 until there began the terror the 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.920
 blurred red face had become 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.670
 the devil himself scared us 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:49.460
 very much and we closed the scare game 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:53.270
 but because I was so stupid because I did 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:55.670
 that were well frightened when 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.400
 suddenly something was heard on the phone 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.860
 that not only the skin was someone with a voice 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.290
 very serious devil type that said have 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.140

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.209

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:16.010
 We ran to see what happened the 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:19.190

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:27.470
 seeing what happened we console Pedro 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:30.070
 but everything was in vain we were still 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:33.200
 scared but we did not give importance 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:36.200
 last day we told Pedro that 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.030

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.239
