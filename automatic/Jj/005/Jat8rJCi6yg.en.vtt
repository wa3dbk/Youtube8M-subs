 note it may be a tablet this same 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.930
 process I'm going to do a launch tutorial 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.210
 then use first 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.909
 let's use a smaller volume 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.860
 otham power and the home button that the 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:18.710

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:43.020
 wait and wait to enter the 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:48.450
 walk through the club mount recovery 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:54.420
 this one here version 5.1 8.485 make the 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:56.610
 next we will use the 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.579
 bk store 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:04.130
 this is the initial panel of the cruzmaltino and 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:07.460
 What is a very good program like? 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:10.429
 and very useful for making 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:14.720
 john was doing a cash reset company 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:16.940
 formatting partitions and to have a 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.980
 very good function 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:23.510
 There you go, the story comes here. 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:27.400
 from caen history 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.400
 you go on bekaa 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:42.019
 then you will select power button and it 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:46.720
 will create an image of your original will 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:46.720
 create an md5 format ok 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.340
 remembering that this process is very useful 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.519
 for those who want to make rum facilities 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:58.540
 is different from the original in your 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:02.000
 smartphone is a better process than 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:04.540
 use the programs portway of pi 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.540
 your suppliers 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:12.459
 good even here I get up to speed on 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.459
 video 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.080
 the union will take care 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.959
 continuing to make a process of the 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:37.920
 ether reset the cash idol 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:40.579
 I will not go into details ok I'll do it 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.890
 here a street cleaning with a system 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:47.340
 stuffing everything in another tutorial 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:52.739
 has an explanation about this process 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:54.569
 the aip factor reset a partiu system quay 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:58.500
 part system 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:04:02.069
 everything has a purpose I'm going to do there 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:08.450
 here is a quick explanation that the goal 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:11.310
 is to make the original copy of the steal cap 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:15.989
 done it, let's give it a rebound 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:18.930
 how to boot the system will install 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:23.699
 the different brown brown for 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:27.539
 demonstration of our video ok let's go 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:30.419
 for here the situation of another with good 

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:35.940
 starting here continuing with you ' 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:37.830
 whether based on 1991 lg is 400f 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:43.770
 I will demonstrate that another clothing and 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:47.099
 I installed our lg reminding you that you can 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:51.500
 be done in other cases. 

00:04:47.099 --> 00:05:00.800
 appliances with the mold recovery 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:05:00.800
 how to turn off that shock. 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:09.780
 now it 's wait a little bit, it's turned off 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:14.039
 now I will use the buttons will enter 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:15.090
 econ in order see if one will tighten the 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:17.550
 lower volume 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:22.760
 give it power and blame the home button that the 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:22.760
 center button press at the same time 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:33.140
 holding on hand that best camera here 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:37.820
 to keep a close eye on not having 

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:37.820
 good is here is the panel 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:45.610
 Right here showing cosmu training 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:51.849
 and we will choose backup in 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:55.300
 some history you will in history 

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:56.979
 Paulo art and to confirm what the 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.800
 its may seem like one of the two trades 

00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:02.830
 types of backup and I will use the 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:06.270
 first and the first time I did this 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:09.280
 another was another backup of another video 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:13.060
 used from above with film confirm with 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:15.490
 the right power button in Sao Paulo is 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:22.020
 important to confirm 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:22.020
 Trust in him you know 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:28.870
 again this personal method is very 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:33.300
 good has another method better than this 

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:35.620
 to retrieve your original put here 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:42.069
 wait a little bit the process is not 

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:45.000
 so long and I get up to speed on 

00:06:42.069 --> 00:06:45.000
 video 

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:54.470
 ready or completed process 

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:58.880
 Let's take a rebound on the system to 

00:06:54.470 --> 00:07:04.900
 boot back up there and cult 

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:09.980
 and bolt there are net which to confirm 

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:12.440
 Here the original clothes are returned and the 

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:15.830
 a backup with cruzmaltino 

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:18.350
 recovery by remembering that the cosmu 

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:22.610
 repurchase for each specific smartphone 

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:25.130
 look for research and I will make available only 

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:27.830
 of rg is skateboards efe 

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:30.950
 plus a case tutorial reflects the 

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:34.070
 forgotten to a like there gives strength to 

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:38.770
 the growth of the channel and was 

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:38.770
 Thank you so much until the next video.
