camera down somewhere possibly tripping

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.490 
camera down somewhere possibly tripping
over<00:00:21.730> it<00:00:21.880> stepping<00:00:22.360> over<00:00:22.599> it<00:00:22.900> losing<00:00:23.380> it

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:23.500 
over it stepping over it losing it

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.290

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:28.270 
so what I found was the camera slingers

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.280 
so what I found was the camera slingers
it's<00:00:28.989> a<00:00:29.349> double<00:00:30.279> harness<00:00:30.640> slinger<00:00:31.419> that<00:00:31.989> lets

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.290 
it's a double harness slinger that lets

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.250 
it's a double harness slinger that lets
you<00:00:32.640> rest<00:00:33.640> this<00:00:33.940> on<00:00:34.180> your<00:00:34.360> shoulders<00:00:34.720> and<00:00:34.930> then

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.080 
you rest this on your shoulders and then
straps<00:00:36.040> down<00:00:36.219> and<00:00:36.579> then<00:00:36.670> it's<00:00:36.790> got<00:00:36.940> two

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.090 
straps down and then it's got two

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.299 
straps down and then it's got two
cameras<00:00:37.540> attached<00:00:37.809> to<00:00:38.050> it<00:00:38.170> that<00:00:38.320> way<00:00:38.920> I'm<00:00:39.160> not

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:39.309 
cameras attached to it that way I'm not

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:41.069 
cameras attached to it that way I'm not
losing<00:00:39.460> track<00:00:39.880> of<00:00:39.910> where<00:00:40.090> my<00:00:40.210> cameras<00:00:40.600> are<00:00:40.780> and

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:41.079 
losing track of where my cameras are and

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:42.779 
losing track of where my cameras are and
they're<00:00:41.320> relatively<00:00:41.890> safe<00:00:42.219> as<00:00:42.429> long<00:00:42.460> as<00:00:42.730> I

00:00:42.779 --> 00:00:42.789 
they're relatively safe as long as I

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:44.849 
they're relatively safe as long as I
don't<00:00:42.850> get<00:00:43.210> too<00:00:43.359> low<00:00:43.539> to<00:00:43.899> the<00:00:43.929> ground<00:00:44.050> so<00:00:44.710> let's

00:00:44.849 --> 00:00:44.859 
don't get too low to the ground so let's

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:46.619 
don't get too low to the ground so let's
talk<00:00:45.010> about<00:00:45.070> how<00:00:45.399> this<00:00:45.579> thing<00:00:45.789> works<00:00:45.820> and<00:00:46.300> the

makes you feel secure and then you can
lock<00:01:31.450> it<00:01:31.630> in<00:01:32.220> really<00:01:33.220> well<00:01:33.340> it<00:01:33.670> doesn't<00:01:33.880> go

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
lock it in really well it doesn't go

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.010 
lock it in really well it doesn't go
anywhere<00:01:34.410> and<00:01:35.410> here's<00:01:35.590> how<00:01:35.710> you<00:01:35.770> wear<00:01:36.010> it

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
anywhere and here's how you wear it

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.720 
anywhere and here's how you wear it
let's<00:01:38.020> see<00:01:39.120> what<00:01:40.120> was<00:01:40.270> this<00:01:40.420> okay<00:01:41.520> just<00:01:42.520> goes

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:42.730 
let's see what was this okay just goes

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.570 
let's see what was this okay just goes
like<00:01:42.850> this<00:01:43.410> the<00:01:44.410> nice<00:01:44.590> thing<00:01:44.620> about<00:01:44.890> it<00:01:45.220> is<00:01:45.370> it

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
like this the nice thing about it is it

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.280 
like this the nice thing about it is it
only<00:01:45.790> has<00:01:46.060> the<00:01:46.240> one<00:01:46.360> adjustment<00:01:46.840> in<00:01:47.020> the<00:01:47.110> back

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
only has the one adjustment in the back

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.410 
only has the one adjustment in the back
so<00:01:47.500> there's<00:01:47.680> nothing<00:01:47.860> kind<00:01:48.730> of<00:01:48.820> income<00:01:49.180> brain

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
so there's nothing kind of income brain

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.290 
so there's nothing kind of income brain
that<00:01:49.630> goes<00:01:49.780> right<00:01:49.960> here<00:01:50.020> and<00:01:50.410> then<00:01:51.190> again<00:01:52.090> mine

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300 
that goes right here and then again mine

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.480 
that goes right here and then again mine

like<00:02:01.960> this<00:02:02.080> product<00:02:02.380> but<00:02:02.710> there's<00:02:03.010> a<00:02:03.070> couple

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
like this product but there's a couple

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.920 
like this product but there's a couple
of<00:02:03.400> things<00:02:03.460> that<00:02:03.790> probably<00:02:04.000> need<00:02:04.360> improvement

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
of things that probably need improvement

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.360 
of things that probably need improvement
which<00:02:05.110> I<00:02:05.260> kind<00:02:05.500> of<00:02:05.560> worked<00:02:05.740> around<00:02:06.040> so<00:02:06.160> let<00:02:06.310> me

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.370 
which I kind of worked around so let me

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.210 
which I kind of worked around so let me
show<00:02:06.550> you<00:02:06.580> those<00:02:07.050> the<00:02:08.050> camera<00:02:08.440> itself<00:02:08.560> is

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
show you those the camera itself is

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.390 
show you those the camera itself is
attached<00:02:09.879> with<00:02:10.269> this<00:02:10.509> a<00:02:10.720> piece<00:02:11.709> and<00:02:12.010> it

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
attached with this a piece and it

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.070 
attached with this a piece and it
actually<00:02:12.550> has<00:02:12.849> a<00:02:12.879> second<00:02:13.269> security<00:02:13.599> fastener

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
actually has a second security fastener

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.350 
actually has a second security fastener
it<00:02:14.560> was<00:02:14.709> a<00:02:14.739> round<00:02:15.220> disc<00:02:15.550> that<00:02:15.790> went<00:02:16.000> right<00:02:16.180> in

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
it was a round disc that went right in

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.839 
it was a round disc that went right in
here<00:02:16.599> the<00:02:16.750> problem<00:02:17.200> was<00:02:17.409> that<00:02:17.439> it<00:02:18.040> would<00:02:18.519> fall

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
here the problem was that it would fall

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:20.789 
here the problem was that it would fall
off<00:02:18.879> easily<00:02:19.420> when<00:02:19.989> it's<00:02:20.109> not<00:02:20.230> attached<00:02:20.560> to<00:02:20.590> the

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:20.799 
off easily when it's not attached to the

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:21.590 
off easily when it's not attached to the
camera

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
camera

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.870 
camera
and<00:02:21.690> I<00:02:21.960> lost<00:02:22.260> mine<00:02:22.620> so<00:02:23.100> I<00:02:23.130> don't<00:02:23.550> know<00:02:23.700> where

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
and I lost mine so I don't know where

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.970 
and I lost mine so I don't know where
that<00:02:24.090> is<00:02:24.120> however<00:02:24.570> it's<00:02:25.500> still<00:02:25.650> fairly

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
that is however it's still fairly

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.130 
that is however it's still fairly
securely<00:02:26.730> fastened<00:02:27.180> so<00:02:27.390> it<00:02:27.570> hasn't<00:02:27.840> really

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
securely fastened so it hasn't really

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.620 
securely fastened so it hasn't really
been<00:02:28.320> an<00:02:28.470> issue<00:02:28.590> for<00:02:28.770> me<00:02:29.100> the<00:02:29.910> second<00:02:30.450> thing

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
been an issue for me the second thing

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.900 
been an issue for me the second thing
that<00:02:30.660> I<00:02:30.870> kind<00:02:31.620> of<00:02:31.740> felt<00:02:32.010> needed<00:02:32.220> improvement

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
that I kind of felt needed improvement

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.830 
that I kind of felt needed improvement
but<00:02:33.120> I<00:02:33.150> modified<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:35.120> adjustment<00:02:36.120> mechanism

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
but I modified the adjustment mechanism

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.990 
but I modified the adjustment mechanism
right<00:02:36.990> here<00:02:37.230> on<00:02:37.350> the<00:02:37.470> shoulder<00:02:37.770> harness<00:02:38.190> its

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
right here on the shoulder harness its

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.330 
right here on the shoulder harness its
lips<00:02:39.390> open<00:02:39.630> fairly<00:02:40.350> easily<00:02:40.590> it<00:02:40.890> doesn't<00:02:41.220> have

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
lips open fairly easily it doesn't have

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.460 
lips open fairly easily it doesn't have
a<00:02:41.370> really<00:02:41.700> good<00:02:42.330> locking<00:02:42.600> mechanism<00:02:43.290> right

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
a really good locking mechanism right

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.740 
a really good locking mechanism right
here<00:02:43.680> so<00:02:43.860> I<00:02:44.100> just<00:02:44.310> adjusted<00:02:44.850> with<00:02:45.090> a<00:02:45.330> safety

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
here so I just adjusted with a safety

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.080 
here so I just adjusted with a safety
pin<00:02:46.020> but<00:02:46.680> all<00:02:46.890> those<00:02:47.130> little<00:02:47.400> tweaks<00:02:47.790> here<00:02:48.030> and

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
pin but all those little tweaks here and

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.210 
pin but all those little tweaks here and
there<00:02:48.240> and<00:02:48.540> it<00:02:48.630> works<00:02:48.810> really<00:02:49.050> well<00:02:49.200> so<00:02:49.980> for

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
there and it works really well so for

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.610 
there and it works really well so for
$85<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.300> camera<00:02:51.660> slingers<00:02:52.020> is<00:02:52.200> actually<00:02:52.560> a

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
$85 the camera slingers is actually a

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.740 
$85 the camera slingers is actually a
pretty<00:02:52.830> good<00:02:52.920> solution<00:02:53.640> for<00:02:53.910> you<00:02:54.390> double

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
pretty good solution for you double

pretty good solution for you double
