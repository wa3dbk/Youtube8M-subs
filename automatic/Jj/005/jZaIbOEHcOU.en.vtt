00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.650 

I<00:00:10.370> think<00:00:11.370> our<00:00:11.519> teacher-student<00:00:12.150> relationship

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
I think our teacher-student relationship

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.260 
I think our teacher-student relationship
definitely<00:00:14.540> influences<00:00:15.540> students<00:00:16.410> choices

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:17.270 
definitely influences students choices

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.390

let's say I am a teacher and I am
amazingly<00:00:21.119> good<00:00:21.390> at<00:00:21.539> mathematics<00:00:21.779> and<00:00:22.410> I'm

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
amazingly good at mathematics and I'm

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.859 
amazingly good at mathematics and I'm
really<00:00:23.279> able<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.730> pull<00:00:24.210> my<00:00:24.390> students

attention<00:00:25.289> towards<00:00:25.560> maths<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:26.160> student

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
attention towards maths and student

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.759 
attention towards maths and student
starts<00:00:27.480> doing<00:00:27.660> well<00:00:27.840> in<00:00:27.960> that<00:00:28.109> student

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
starts doing well in that student

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.169 
starts doing well in that student
definitely<00:00:29.220> is<00:00:29.279> going<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.550> come<00:00:29.730> to<00:00:29.910> a<00:00:29.939> fella

goes like me and ask what are the

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.080 
goes like me and ask what are the
options<00:00:32.189> later<00:00:32.340> demands

similarly in fact today morning only the

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.229 
similarly in fact today morning only the
girl<00:00:35.940> I<00:00:36.239> was<00:00:36.510> counseling<00:00:36.860> she<00:00:37.860> said<00:00:38.250> that<00:00:38.520> till

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
girl I was counseling she said that till

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.150 
girl I was counseling she said that till
8th<00:00:39.540> class<00:00:39.750> I<00:00:40.110> was<00:00:40.260> not<00:00:40.440> really<00:00:40.620> interested<00:00:41.070> in

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
8th class I was not really interested in

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.250 
8th class I was not really interested in
science<00:00:41.579> but<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.360> moment<00:00:42.660> I<00:00:42.690> got<00:00:42.809> into<00:00:43.020> ninth

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
science but the moment I got into ninth

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.020 
science but the moment I got into ninth
my<00:00:43.829> teacher<00:00:44.100> change<00:00:44.520> that<00:00:44.700> perception

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
my teacher change that perception

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.330 
my teacher change that perception
because<00:00:45.719> of<00:00:45.899> her<00:00:46.079> I<00:00:46.289> started<00:00:46.620> liking<00:00:46.860> physics

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
because of her I started liking physics

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.340 
because of her I started liking physics
and<00:00:47.460> chemistry<00:00:47.550> mode<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.300> I<00:00:48.899> was<00:00:49.079> earlier

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
and chemistry mode and I was earlier

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.869 
and chemistry mode and I was earlier
very<00:00:49.500> clear<00:00:49.829> that<00:00:50.039> I<00:00:50.070> don't<00:00:50.460> want<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.760> take

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
very clear that I don't want to take

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.490 
very clear that I don't want to take
science<00:00:51.120> in<00:00:51.390> but<00:00:51.600> today<00:00:51.870> I<00:00:51.899> am<00:00:52.079> still<00:00:52.289> thinking

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
science in but today I am still thinking

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.619 
science in but today I am still thinking
between<00:00:53.039> science<00:00:53.579> versus<00:00:53.969> commerce<00:00:54.329> versus

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
between science versus commerce versus

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.319 
between science versus commerce versus
humanities<00:00:55.100> so<00:00:56.300> such<00:00:57.300> instances<00:00:58.020> do<00:00:58.620> occur<00:00:59.329> at

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
humanities so such instances do occur at

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.380 
humanities so such instances do occur at
times<00:01:01.280> negatively<00:01:02.280> let's<00:01:02.699> say<00:01:02.850> I<00:01:03.059> as<00:01:03.359> a

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
times negatively let's say I as a

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.800 
times negatively let's say I as a
teacher<00:01:03.890> the<00:01:04.890> student<00:01:05.339> develops<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.390> negative

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
teacher the student develops a negative

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.929 
teacher the student develops a negative
orientation<00:01:07.260> towards<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.619> subject<00:01:08.040> might<00:01:08.640> not

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
orientation towards a subject might not

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.760 
orientation towards a subject might not
like<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.270> take<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:09.810> at<00:01:10.020> all

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
like to take it at all

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.340 
like to take it at all
so<00:01:11.840> student-teacher<00:01:12.840> relationship

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
so student-teacher relationship

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.270 
so student-teacher relationship
definitely<00:01:14.040> influences<00:01:14.700> our<00:01:15.600> career<00:01:15.900> choice

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
definitely influences our career choice

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.499 
definitely influences our career choice
attempt<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.369> teacher<00:01:17.580> also<00:01:18.090> inadvertently

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
attempt the teacher also inadvertently

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.399 
attempt the teacher also inadvertently
might<00:01:19.170> say<00:01:20.540> like<00:01:21.540> it<00:01:21.930> happened<00:01:22.290> with<00:01:22.320> a

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
might say like it happened with a

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.130 
might say like it happened with a
student<00:01:22.890> in<00:01:23.460> 11th<00:01:23.850> class<00:01:24.000> array

Abhishek Tony Thomas Lilia I wish it was
a<00:01:29.430> person<00:01:29.790> who<00:01:29.909> had<00:01:29.970> got<00:01:30.600> ninety<00:01:30.930> two<00:01:31.049> point

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
a person who had got ninety two point

a person who had got ninety two point
five<00:01:31.380> percent<00:01:31.759> from<00:01:32.759> one<00:01:32.939> other<00:01:33.060> da<00:01:33.299> B's<00:01:33.540> and

five percent from one other da B's and

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.660 
five percent from one other da B's and
the<00:01:33.990> teacher<00:01:34.890> said<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.490> me<00:01:36.170> commas<00:01:37.170> Lilia<00:01:37.670> I

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
the right thing so I think teachers need

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.490 
the right thing so I think teachers need
to<00:01:44.430> desist<00:01:44.850> from<00:01:45.180> making<00:01:45.600> such<00:01:45.869> general

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500

knowledge base about certain careers at

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.959 
knowledge base about certain careers at
times<00:01:53.610> teachers<00:01:53.970> say<00:01:55.100> bb8<00:01:56.100> OSA<00:01:56.520> course<00:01:56.790> with

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
times teachers say bb8 OSA course with

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.270 
times teachers say bb8 OSA course with
that<00:01:57.090> engineering<00:01:58.079> Wow<00:01:58.380> an<00:01:58.649> earring<00:01:58.950> is<00:01:59.070> good

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
that engineering Wow an earring is good

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.609 
that engineering Wow an earring is good
so<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.060> moment<00:02:00.240> that<00:02:00.390> kind<00:02:00.689> of<00:02:00.899> thought

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
so the moment that kind of thought

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.649 
so the moment that kind of thought
process<00:02:01.680> is<00:02:02.219> there<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:02.790> is<00:02:02.969> translated<00:02:03.360> to

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
process is there it is translated to

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.410 
process is there it is translated to
students<00:02:04.170> their<00:02:04.619> choices<00:02:04.950> are<00:02:05.430> influenced

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
because a teacher in a school is
