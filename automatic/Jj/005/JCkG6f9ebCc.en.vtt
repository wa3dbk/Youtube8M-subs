there is again that conflict and what

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.490 
there is again that conflict and what
what<00:02:30.090> I<00:02:30.120> would<00:02:30.450> recommend<00:02:30.570> for<00:02:31.080> people<00:02:31.110> is

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
what I would recommend for people is

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.230 
what I would recommend for people is
that<00:02:31.650> they<00:02:31.710> they<00:02:32.430> manage<00:02:32.850> expectations

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
that they they manage expectations

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.210 
that they they manage expectations
because<00:02:33.990> expectations<00:02:34.740> are<00:02:34.890> really<00:02:35.070> what

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
because expectations are really what

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.550 
because expectations are really what
drive<00:02:35.460> battles<00:02:36.000> so<00:02:36.240> if<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.900> older<00:02:37.170> kids<00:02:37.410> are

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
drive battles so if the older kids are

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.650 
drive battles so if the older kids are
expecting<00:02:38.010> to<00:02:38.190> be<00:02:38.220> treated<00:02:38.550> exactly<00:02:38.820> the<00:02:39.300> same

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.600 
expecting to be treated exactly the same
as<00:02:39.960> the<00:02:40.590> younger<00:02:40.860> kids<00:02:41.010> and<00:02:41.190> the<00:02:41.250> will<00:02:41.400> and
