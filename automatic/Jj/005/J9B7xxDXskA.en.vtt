00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:03.730
 do not 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:45.140
 and appetite for sports and all this is 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.550
 selection of little ones have done this 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.810
 helped being very small too that what 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.570
 combined with football becomes 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:52.640
 Madrid champion runner-up of Spain 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:55.310
 with football he spent five hours 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.740
 day or he spent his life running and 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:01.250
 doing aerobic sport and radio 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:02.960
 born after the solution to my 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.000
 need to do an aerobic sport 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.470
 that whatever I 'm capable of 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.470
 squeeze me as much as I need 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.680
 I believe that all power is treatment 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:18.680
 until only what we do day 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.550
 of the universe everything first to the convert 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:25.130
 that it is true that that part of 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:27.020
 constant self-demand that is also 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.340
 one thing is indivisible the other universe 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.780
 is what it is because always thought that 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.920
 everything could be better because 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.960
 many cousins ​​that we've got 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.060
 I always think we could get more 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:39.470
 there, the running is that this 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:41.150
 philosophy is the feeling that always 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.440
 can be a little bit further if you think 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.720
 that no matter how much you have overcome today 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:48.970
 what you have and you will be able to overcome more 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.970
 tomorrow, these sensations 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.479
 unfortunately, sport has 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.979
 been much more books has been much more 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:02.340
 wild at some point not the least 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.440
 mechanized and the telethon the rally I do not know 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.850
 if that thing goes with the 30 kilometers 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.680
 come back to my rhythm I know what improper and 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.940
 control and what thing I have the 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.619
 advantage of that much my whole life of 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.970
 cut the more or less I control 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.550
 exactly my body I know how far 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.930
 arrive and I know how to control the efforts 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.120
 that has been keeping during those 30 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.489
 kilometers and at some point I feel 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.930
 better and I like to give a little more cane 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.340
 and at some point I see that it is slow 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.800
 better when when the title goes 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.360
 with very different rhythms but good 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.370
 I like to make the situation of freedom 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:33.810
 and press a moment I see that everything 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:36.019
 give him more rhythm and time I see how I have 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.019
 fact 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:42.410
 I do not like it I can not stand mechanizing the 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.410
 sport 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.750
 is a practice site also to the 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.240
 time to treat people who are not 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.920
 made for people with pasta to people 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.990
 who likes to eat write because 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.450
 we have to eat nothing else I have it there 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.010
 valet because there are no people 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.320
 stretched serving you because the only thing 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.340
 we have is to cook from the milk what the 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.340
 people in front of what we do 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.990
 the moment of having finished a day of 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.520
 so much work in various beds all 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:17.890
 the days came out of those intensive 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.690
 go jogging and feel well 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.250
 time to get home they can analyze 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.940
 those 10 minutes as happened during 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.940
 all the world 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.260
 it is the best paradise 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:37.019
 I think you have to enjoy the 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:38.579
 sport without ties of any kind and 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:40.790
 what you put on you lives that put the 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:40.790
 the rest 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.200
 of harmful and that in sport as in 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.600
 life can always be beyond 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.420
 as much as it is always achieved 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:53.290
 can you can improve what you have to 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.610
 have is winning attitude of what is 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.860
 eat the world and power is like the world 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:01.690
 since both when you run and when 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.690
 scales like when you cook 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:08.380
 to this day to this day I have 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.000
 objectively I work more than ever the 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.670
 done more hours than ever I do not rest a 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.080
 only day of the week I sleep less than 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.780
 never but today I have a 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:19.299
 feeling that I'm mental and 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.500
 physically less tired than ever and of 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:21.910
 I do not work as much as before 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.290
 simply because now I am much more 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.090
 productive and also my type books 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.040
 unable to enjoy much more than what 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.610
 I enjoyed it before and I think this 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.870
 has a lot to do with this attitude 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.470
 vital to life and sports 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.470
 both
