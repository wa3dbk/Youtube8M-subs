00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
the first is the use of the word

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.210 
the first is the use of the word
innocent<00:02:35.730> using<00:02:36.600> this<00:02:36.690> adjective<00:02:37.290> implies

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
important to highlight this area second

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.690 
important to highlight this area second
it's<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:43.500> use<00:02:43.620> of<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:43.860> word<00:02:44.040> the<00:02:44.190> very<00:02:44.430> date

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
it's the use of the word the very date

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.400 
it's the use of the word the very date
which<00:02:45.060> emphasizes<00:02:45.600> something<00:02:46.110> about<00:02:46.290> the
