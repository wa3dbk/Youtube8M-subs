they<00:04:02.880> imitating<00:04:03.450> at<00:04:03.570> first<00:04:03.840> you<00:04:04.380> mean<00:04:04.500> on<00:04:04.650> the

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
they imitating at first you mean on the

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.160 
they imitating at first you mean on the
video<00:04:04.950> no<00:04:05.610> when<00:04:06.060> the<00:04:06.150> kids<00:04:06.360> are<00:04:06.480> watching<00:04:06.660> yeah

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
there they first imitating yes and then

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.040 
there they first imitating yes and then
it<00:04:11.400> becomes<00:04:11.790> creation<00:04:12.330> somewhere<00:04:12.630> else<00:04:12.840> which

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
it becomes creation somewhere else which

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:14.690 
it becomes creation somewhere else which
just<00:04:13.350> goes<00:04:13.440> on<00:04:13.620> yes<00:04:13.980> that's<00:04:14.280> correct

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
just goes on yes that's correct

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.610 
just goes on yes that's correct
and<00:04:14.850> you<00:04:15.720> know<00:04:15.840> a<00:04:15.870> lot<00:04:15.989> of<00:04:16.049> people<00:04:16.380> have<00:04:16.530> been

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
that they will fall into a pattern of

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.320 
that they will fall into a pattern of
it's<00:04:23.430> called<00:04:23.640> echolalia

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
it's called echolalia

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.110 
it's called echolalia
and<00:04:24.480> that<00:04:24.840> is<00:04:24.990> the<00:04:25.880> repeating<00:04:26.880> that<00:04:26.970> you're

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
and that is the repeating that you're

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.659 
and that is the repeating that you're
talking<00:04:27.270> about<00:04:27.540> but<00:04:28.440> that's<00:04:28.890> a<00:04:29.010> typical<00:04:29.220> stage

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
talking about but that's a typical stage

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:31.640 
talking about but that's a typical stage
of<00:04:30.000> language<00:04:30.540> development<00:04:30.690> for<00:04:31.200> any<00:04:31.320> child

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
of language development for any child

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
you know you see a it starts with really

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.409 
you know you see a it starts with really
just<00:04:34.590> rate<00:04:35.070> gesturing<00:04:35.669> with<00:04:35.790> you<00:04:36.300> know

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 
just rate gesturing with you know

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:38.120 
just rate gesturing with you know
infants<00:04:36.810> where<00:04:36.990> they<00:04:37.110> smile<00:04:37.350> smile<00:04:37.890> or<00:04:38.100> you

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
clapping and so that's something that

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.850 
clapping and so that's something that
people<00:04:42.330> should<00:04:42.450> not<00:04:42.690> be<00:04:42.750> fearful<00:04:43.410> out<00:04:43.650> there

people should not be fearful out there
rather<00:04:44.780> an<00:04:45.780> important<00:04:46.350> step<00:04:46.620> toward<00:04:47.130> language

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
rather an important step toward language

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.420 
rather an important step toward language
development<00:04:48.540> and<00:04:48.750> socialization<00:04:49.370> okay<00:04:50.370> so

exactly<00:04:57.930> a<00:04:58.470> little<00:04:58.710> bit<00:04:58.919> of<00:04:59.010> both<00:05:00.680> we

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
exactly a little bit of both we

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.820 
exactly a little bit of both we
definitely<00:05:02.520> have<00:05:03.210> I<00:05:03.510> mean<00:05:03.930> when<00:05:04.410> we<00:05:04.530> sit<00:05:04.740> down

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
definitely have I mean when we sit down

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.100 
definitely have I mean when we sit down
and<00:05:05.039> decide<00:05:05.280> what<00:05:05.640> what<00:05:06.270> to<00:05:06.390> do<00:05:06.539> next<00:05:06.720> or<00:05:06.990> the

and decide what what to do next or the

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:08.129 
and decide what what to do next or the
list<00:05:07.530> is<00:05:07.680> endless

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:08.139 
list is endless

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:10.589 
list is endless
because<00:05:08.379> literally<00:05:08.729> some<00:05:09.729> of<00:05:09.819> these<00:05:09.909> children

00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:10.599 
because literally some of these children

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:13.709 
because literally some of these children
you<00:05:10.749> have<00:05:10.960> to<00:05:11.110> teach<00:05:11.319> them<00:05:12.180> their<00:05:13.180> life<00:05:13.419> you

light<00:05:17.800> switch<00:05:18.069> on<00:05:18.279> is<00:05:18.550> something<00:05:19.330> that<00:05:19.449> we

00:05:19.649 --> 00:05:19.659 
light switch on is something that we

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:22.950 
light switch on is something that we
will<00:05:19.840> film<00:05:20.169> and<00:05:20.439> teach<00:05:20.879> but<00:05:21.879> a<00:05:21.939> parent<00:05:22.539> can<00:05:22.749> by
