the<00:01:19.979> book<00:01:20.189> is<00:01:20.400> rather<00:01:20.640> large<00:01:21.000> so<00:01:21.299> I<00:01:21.330> had<00:01:21.659> to

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
the book is rather large so I had to

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.230 
the book is rather large so I had to
extend<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:23.659> wire<00:01:24.659> frames<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:26.040> 30<00:01:26.490> far<00:01:26.939> out

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
extend the wire frames the 30 far out

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.499 
extend the wire frames the 30 far out
and<00:01:27.780> also<00:01:28.380> you<00:01:29.009> have<00:01:29.159> just<00:01:29.520> turn<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:30.030> so<00:01:30.240> you

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
and also you have just turn it so you

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.499 
and also you have just turn it so you
can<00:01:30.720> see<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.110> this<00:01:32.040> side<00:01:32.880> here<00:01:33.180> is<00:01:33.329> also

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
can see it this side here is also

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.890 
can see it this side here is also
extended<00:01:34.259> very<00:01:34.500> high<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:35.490> cover<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.659> whole

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
extended very high to cover the whole

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.219 
extended very high to cover the whole
page<00:01:37.759> because<00:01:38.759> it's<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.240> over<00:01:39.600> 10<00:01:39.840> inches

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
page because it's the over 10 inches

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:46.030 
page because it's the over 10 inches
tall<00:01:40.530> so<00:01:41.390> you<00:01:42.799> may<00:01:43.799> need<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.070> use<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.850> different

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
tall so you may need to use a different

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.649 
tall so you may need to use a different
rather<00:01:47.040> than<00:01:47.280> putting<00:01:47.549> it<00:01:47.759> right<00:01:47.790> there

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
rather than putting it right there

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.929 
rather than putting it right there
in<00:01:48.780> this<00:01:49.079> in<00:01:49.590> this<00:01:49.799> slot<00:01:50.130> where<00:01:50.399> it's<00:01:50.520> intended

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
in this in this slot where it's intended

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.969 
in this in this slot where it's intended
to<00:01:51.119> with<00:01:51.479> this<00:01:51.720> there<00:01:52.350> with<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.710> platform

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
to with this there with the platform

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.510 
to with this there with the platform
extended<00:01:53.790> this<00:01:53.939> far<00:01:54.000> out<00:01:54.270> you<00:01:55.170> can<00:01:55.380> move<00:01:55.680> to

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
extended this far out you can move to

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.330 
extended this far out you can move to
the<00:01:56.969> next<00:01:57.000> slot<00:01:57.570> on<00:01:57.810> both<00:01:58.110> sides<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:58.770> this

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
the next slot on both sides and this

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.240 
the next slot on both sides and this
creates<00:02:00.090> sufficient<00:02:00.719> tension<00:02:01.259> so<00:02:01.740> that<00:02:01.770> the

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
creates sufficient tension so that the

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.340 
creates sufficient tension so that the
the<00:02:02.610> platform<00:02:03.030> is<00:02:03.509> not<00:02:03.570> going<00:02:04.140> down<00:02:05.719> by<00:02:06.719> itself

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
the platform is not going down by itself

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.460 
the platform is not going down by itself
okay<00:02:07.979> so<00:02:08.399> that

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
okay so that

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.770 
okay so that
takes<00:02:10.010> me<00:02:10.280> to<00:02:10.610> the<00:02:11.270> next<00:02:11.480> step<00:02:11.930> of<00:02:12.140> a<00:02:13.570> turn<00:02:14.570> on

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
takes me to the next step of a turn on

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:25.450 
takes me to the next step of a turn on
camera<00:02:17.470> and<00:02:19.030> the<00:02:20.030> light<00:02:20.270> and<00:02:23.620> to<00:02:24.620> just<00:02:24.890> adjust

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
camera and the light and to just adjust

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:41.440 
camera and the light and to just adjust
it<00:02:25.640> to<00:02:25.850> this<00:02:26.030> level

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.309 

okay<00:02:42.319> so<00:02:42.500> after<00:02:42.920> this<00:02:43.069> initial<00:02:43.730> setup<00:02:44.270> I<00:02:44.630> will

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 
okay so after this initial setup I will

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:55.559 
okay so after this initial setup I will
just<00:02:45.650> press<00:02:46.099> the<00:02:46.340> plus<00:02:46.640> sign<00:02:48.220> and<00:02:49.599> ten<00:02:50.599> pages

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:58.840 

in<00:02:56.569> this<00:02:56.720> case<00:02:57.080> making<00:02:57.680> just<00:02:58.069> like<00:02:58.340> my<00:02:58.520> fingers

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
in this case making just like my fingers

in this case making just like my fingers
like<00:02:59.030> this<00:03:00.190> across<00:03:01.190> the<00:03:01.250> page<00:03:02.140> level<00:03:04.510> or<00:03:06.430> with

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
like this across the page level or with

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.729 
like this across the page level or with
the<00:03:07.610> ruler<00:03:08.030> you<00:03:08.239> can<00:03:08.269> just<00:03:08.660> hold<00:03:08.989> this<00:03:09.230> with

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739

the ruler and then press the page after
about<00:03:13.040> hundred<00:03:13.790> pages<00:03:14.120> so<00:03:14.480> you<00:03:14.510> take<00:03:14.840> all<00:03:15.440> the

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
about hundred pages so you take all the

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.180 
about hundred pages so you take all the
odd<00:03:16.100> pages<00:03:16.519> first<00:03:17.030> after<00:03:17.600> the<00:03:17.630> first<00:03:18.190> roughly

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
odd pages first after the first roughly

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:25.170 
odd pages first after the first roughly
hundred<00:03:19.640> pages<00:03:22.480> okay

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
hundred pages okay

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.210 
hundred pages okay
you<00:03:26.180> would<00:03:26.390> have<00:03:26.600> to<00:03:26.780> adjust<00:03:27.319> this<00:03:27.650> roughly

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
you would have to adjust this roughly

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.229 
you would have to adjust this roughly
have<00:03:28.760> an<00:03:28.970> inch<00:03:29.440> maybe<00:03:30.440> it'll<00:03:30.890> s<00:03:31.190> hole<00:03:31.760> so<00:03:32.090> by

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
have an inch maybe it'll s hole so by

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.300 
have an inch maybe it'll s hole so by
the<00:03:32.299> same<00:03:33.040> amount

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
the same amount

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.880 
the same amount
you<00:03:34.730> can<00:03:34.970> press<00:03:35.390> this<00:03:36.230> setup<00:03:36.650> pin<00:03:38.620> so<00:03:39.620> that<00:03:39.650> you

you can press this setup pin so that you

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.640 
you can press this setup pin so that you
always<00:03:40.069> maintain<00:03:40.519> roughly<00:03:41.480> the<00:03:41.600> same<00:03:41.840> size<00:03:42.319> of

always maintain roughly the same size of
the<00:03:42.769> pages<00:03:43.069> that<00:03:43.430> makes<00:03:43.670> it<00:03:43.970> easy<00:03:44.209> to<00:03:44.330> clock<00:03:44.720> at

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
the pages that makes it easy to clock at

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:53.550 
the pages that makes it easy to clock at
the<00:03:46.280> end<00:03:46.700> of<00:03:47.090> all<00:03:48.019> the<00:03:48.320> odd<00:03:48.530> pages<00:03:51.519> page<00:03:52.519> 405

I'm<00:03:54.560> going<00:03:54.920> to<00:03:55.040> turn<00:03:55.370> the<00:03:55.579> book

and open the homepage number two is the

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.289 
and open the homepage number two is the
first<00:04:04.980> leading<00:04:05.340> edge<00:04:07.849> so<00:04:08.849> there<00:04:09.030> was<00:04:09.180> the

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
first leading edge so there was the

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:12.380 
first leading edge so there was the
first<00:04:09.599> odd<00:04:09.840> page<00:04:10.349> and<00:04:10.829> I<00:04:11.280> remember<00:04:12.060> that<00:04:12.209> was

first odd page and I remember that was

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.589 
first odd page and I remember that was
the<00:04:12.420> first<00:04:12.540> stage<00:04:13.019> I<00:04:13.079> took<00:04:13.500> and<00:04:14.120> this<00:04:15.120> page
