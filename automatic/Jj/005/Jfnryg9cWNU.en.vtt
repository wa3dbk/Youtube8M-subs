creations and today I'm going to show

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.769 
creations and today I'm going to show
you<00:00:04.140> how<00:00:04.380> to<00:00:04.410> create<00:00:04.830> this<00:00:05.009> weave<00:00:05.430> element<00:00:06.060> for

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
you how to create this weave element for

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:13.930 
you how to create this weave element for
your<00:00:06.870> cards

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:13.940 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.390 

I'm<00:00:14.750> using<00:00:14.990> the<00:00:15.290> moonlight<00:00:15.709> designer<00:00:16.099> series

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:16.400 
I'm using the moonlight designer series

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.089 
I'm using the moonlight designer series
paper<00:00:16.760> stack<00:00:16.880> and<00:00:17.449> that<00:00:18.020> comes<00:00:18.320> in<00:00:18.590> a<00:00:18.740> pad<00:00:18.949> of

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:19.099 
paper stack and that comes in a pad of

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:20.620 
paper stack and that comes in a pad of
paper<00:00:19.220> that<00:00:19.430> measures<00:00:19.730> four<00:00:20.180> and<00:00:20.270> a<00:00:20.300> half<00:00:20.330> by

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:20.630 
paper that measures four and a half by

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.200 
paper that measures four and a half by
six<00:00:20.900> and<00:00:21.050> a<00:00:21.140> half<00:00:21.170> and<00:00:21.619> I've<00:00:22.279> cut<00:00:22.550> them<00:00:22.730> in<00:00:22.939> to

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
six and a half and I've cut them in to

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.019 
six and a half and I've cut them in to
three-quarter<00:00:24.079> inch<00:00:24.259> widths<00:00:24.950> and<00:00:25.099> so<00:00:25.910> it's

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:26.029 
three-quarter inch widths and so it's

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:28.510 
three-quarter inch widths and so it's
3/4<00:00:26.570> inches<00:00:26.900> by<00:00:27.259> four<00:00:27.680> and<00:00:27.949> a<00:00:28.009> half

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:28.520 
3/4 inches by four and a half

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.179 
3/4 inches by four and a half
you<00:00:28.939> need<00:00:29.090> to<00:00:29.180> have<00:00:29.329> six<00:00:29.599> pieces<00:00:29.869> and<00:00:30.349> you<00:00:30.980> want

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:31.189 
you need to have six pieces and you want

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:32.709 
you need to have six pieces and you want
to<00:00:31.279> alternate<00:00:31.790> where<00:00:32.000> you<00:00:32.090> have<00:00:32.270> some<00:00:32.540> that

00:00:32.709 --> 00:00:32.719 
to alternate where you have some that

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:34.600 
to alternate where you have some that
are<00:00:32.780> more<00:00:32.989> solid<00:00:33.320> and<00:00:33.739> some<00:00:34.100> that<00:00:34.250> are<00:00:34.430> more

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 
are more solid and some that are more

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.369 
are more solid and some that are more
patterned<00:00:35.890> so<00:00:36.890> pick<00:00:37.160> two<00:00:37.719> that<00:00:38.719> you'd<00:00:38.930> like<00:00:39.140> to

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:39.379 
patterned so pick two that you'd like to

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:45.520 
patterned so pick two that you'd like to
start<00:00:39.680> with<00:00:43.480> so<00:00:44.480> just<00:00:44.510> lay<00:00:44.870> this<00:00:45.079> one<00:00:45.260> right<00:00:45.469> on

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
start with so just lay this one right on

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.229 
start with so just lay this one right on
top<00:00:47.649> so<00:00:48.649> you<00:00:48.890> can<00:00:49.070> use<00:00:49.190> your<00:00:49.339> grit<00:00:49.550> paper<00:00:49.789> to

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
top so you can use your grit paper to

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:52.299 
top so you can use your grit paper to
help<00:00:50.449> keep<00:00:50.839> everything<00:00:51.140> nice<00:00:51.440> and<00:00:51.499> straight

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
help keep everything nice and straight

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:55.090 
help keep everything nice and straight
so<00:00:53.269> that's<00:00:53.480> your<00:00:53.629> first<00:00:53.839> layer<00:00:54.140> and<00:00:54.469> then

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
so that's your first layer and then

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.180 
so that's your first layer and then
you're<00:00:55.190> going<00:00:55.280> to<00:00:55.339> take<00:00:55.550> your<00:00:55.730> next<00:00:55.940> piece<00:00:57.190> and

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
you're going to take your next piece and

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.099 
you're going to take your next piece and
you're<00:00:58.370> going<00:00:58.609> to<00:00:58.640> put<00:00:58.999> this<00:00:59.089> right<00:00:59.210> on<00:00:59.780> top<00:01:00.079> so

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:00.109 
you're going to put this right on top so

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:02.340 
you're going to put this right on top so
just<00:01:00.379> add<00:01:00.620> a<00:01:00.649> little<00:01:00.800> bit<00:01:01.010> of<00:01:01.039> tape<00:01:01.339> right<00:01:01.699> here

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
just add a little bit of tape right here

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.330 
just add a little bit of tape right here
you<00:01:03.350> can<00:01:03.469> go<00:01:03.589> ahead<00:01:03.679> and<00:01:03.859> add<00:01:03.920> some<00:01:03.949> here<00:01:04.489> too

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
you can go ahead and add some here too

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.960 
you can go ahead and add some here too
and<00:01:07.340> just<00:01:07.670> line<00:01:07.880> this<00:01:08.060> up<00:01:08.240> so<00:01:08.270> it<00:01:08.510> touches<00:01:09.970> this

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
and just line this up so it touches this

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.969 
and just line this up so it touches this
paper<00:01:11.270> here<00:01:11.659> you<00:01:11.840> want<00:01:12.020> them<00:01:12.140> as<00:01:12.290> close<00:01:12.620> as<00:01:12.830> you

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
paper here you want them as close as you

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.000 
paper here you want them as close as you
can<00:01:13.159> get<00:01:13.370> them<00:01:13.610> so<00:01:13.909> there's<00:01:14.120> no<00:01:14.330> gap<00:01:14.830> and<00:01:15.830> then

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.010 
can get them so there's no gap and then

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.870 
can get them so there's no gap and then
we'll<00:01:16.130> line<00:01:16.310> this<00:01:16.520> one<00:01:16.760> up<00:01:16.940> over<00:01:17.180> here<00:01:18.760> so<00:01:19.760> the

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
we'll line this one up over here so the

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.570 
we'll line this one up over here so the
next<00:01:20.030> piece<00:01:20.770> and<00:01:21.770> you're<00:01:22.010> going<00:01:22.130> to<00:01:22.160> go<00:01:22.280> under

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
next piece and you're going to go under

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.770 
next piece and you're going to go under
this<00:01:22.730> one<00:01:23.140> just<00:01:24.140> like<00:01:24.440> that<00:01:25.450> so<00:01:26.450> go<00:01:26.600> ahead<00:01:26.690> and

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
this one just like that so go ahead and

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.960 
this one just like that so go ahead and
push<00:01:27.020> that<00:01:27.050> down<00:01:27.260> as<00:01:27.590> far<00:01:27.920> as<00:01:28.250> that<00:01:28.460> will<00:01:28.700> go

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
push that down as far as that will go

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.480 
push that down as far as that will go
and<00:01:29.390> make<00:01:29.540> sure<00:01:29.690> you<00:01:29.780> get<00:01:29.900> really<00:01:30.140> close<00:01:30.490> to

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
and make sure you get really close to

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.390 
and make sure you get really close to
this<00:01:31.670> paper<00:01:31.970> so<00:01:32.330> there's<00:01:32.510> no<00:01:32.690> gaps<00:01:33.310> and<00:01:34.310> you

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
this paper so there's no gaps and you

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.680 
this paper so there's no gaps and you
can<00:01:34.520> fold<00:01:34.730> this<00:01:34.940> one<00:01:35.150> back<00:01:36.730> and<00:01:37.730> add<00:01:37.880> tape<00:01:38.300> and

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
can fold this one back and add tape and

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.140 
can fold this one back and add tape and
then<00:01:39.560> see<00:01:39.770> how<00:01:39.890> this<00:01:40.070> is<00:01:40.250> kind<00:01:40.610> of<00:01:40.700> coming<00:01:41.000> up

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
then see how this is kind of coming up

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.500 
then see how this is kind of coming up
so<00:01:41.360> you're<00:01:41.480> just<00:01:41.630> going<00:01:41.750> to<00:01:41.780> fold<00:01:41.960> this<00:01:42.170> up<00:01:42.410> and

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:43.510 
so you're just going to fold this up and

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:51.760 
so you're just going to fold this up and
add<00:01:44.510> some<00:01:44.810> tape<00:01:45.020> underneath

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.740 

we're<00:01:52.770> going<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:52.950> turn<00:01:53.160> it<00:01:53.400> and<00:01:53.670> repeat<00:01:54.540> for

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
we're going to turn it and repeat for

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.920 
we're going to turn it and repeat for
this<00:01:54.930> one<00:01:55.170> so<00:01:55.980> you're<00:01:56.160> going<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.490> go<00:01:56.850> over<00:01:57.540> and

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
this one so you're going to go over and

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.730 
this one so you're going to go over and
under<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:59.150> then<00:02:00.150> just<00:02:00.390> push<00:02:00.660> this<00:02:00.870> down<00:02:01.200> as

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
under and then just push this down as

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.910 
under and then just push this down as
far<00:02:02.490> as<00:02:02.850> that<00:02:03.060> will<00:02:03.300> go<00:02:03.590> again<00:02:04.590> you're<00:02:04.710> trying

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
far as that will go again you're trying

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.850 
far as that will go again you're trying
to<00:02:05.250> eliminate<00:02:05.910> any<00:02:06.090> gaps<00:02:06.480> and<00:02:07.020> then<00:02:07.620> you<00:02:07.740> can

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
to eliminate any gaps and then you can

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.220 
to eliminate any gaps and then you can
lift<00:02:08.040> this<00:02:08.190> one<00:02:08.369> up<00:02:10.430> add<00:02:11.430> some<00:02:11.760> tape<00:02:12.000> and<00:02:12.330> then

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
lift this one up add some tape and then

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.150 
lift this one up add some tape and then
you<00:02:13.350> can<00:02:13.470> lift<00:02:13.650> this<00:02:13.830> up<00:02:14.600> and<00:02:15.830> add<00:02:16.830> tape

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
you can lift this up and add tape

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:23.210 
you can lift this up and add tape
underneath

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.120 

so<00:02:23.940> once<00:02:24.150> you<00:02:24.300> have<00:02:24.540> this<00:02:24.960> assembled<00:02:25.860> you're

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
so once you have this assembled you're

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.430 
so once you have this assembled you're
going<00:02:26.250> to<00:02:26.310> trim<00:02:26.760> the<00:02:27.210> ends<00:02:27.420> to<00:02:28.050> give<00:02:28.200> it<00:02:28.320> an

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
going to trim the ends to give it an

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.640 
going to trim the ends to give it an
uneven<00:02:29.040> look<00:02:29.450> so<00:02:30.450> what<00:02:30.660> I<00:02:30.690> like<00:02:30.960> to<00:02:31.020> do<00:02:31.350> is

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
uneven look so what I like to do is

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.410 
uneven look so what I like to do is
start<00:02:31.890> with<00:02:32.070> this<00:02:32.280> one<00:02:32.550> so<00:02:33.030> I'm<00:02:33.120> going<00:02:33.240> to<00:02:33.330> make

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
start with this one so I'm going to make

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.120 
start with this one so I'm going to make
this<00:02:33.600> one<00:02:33.900> pretty<00:02:34.710> short<00:02:35.130> and<00:02:36.770> then<00:02:37.770> on<00:02:37.890> this

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
this one pretty short and then on this

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:44.990 
this one pretty short and then on this
side<00:02:38.690> I'm<00:02:39.690> going<00:02:39.870> to<00:02:39.960> make<00:02:40.140> it<00:02:40.350> longer<00:02:43.430> so<00:02:44.430> the

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
side I'm going to make it longer so the

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.030 
side I'm going to make it longer so the
next<00:02:45.210> one<00:02:45.450> is<00:02:45.660> going<00:02:45.870> to<00:02:45.960> be<00:02:46.140> long<00:02:47.960> and<00:02:49.040> then

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
next one is going to be long and then

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.590 
next one is going to be long and then
this<00:02:50.220> one<00:02:50.460> on<00:02:50.610> this<00:02:50.760> side<00:02:50.970> is<00:02:51.180> going<00:02:51.360> to<00:02:51.420> be

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
this one on this side is going to be

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:58.640 
this one on this side is going to be
short<00:02:56.540> this<00:02:57.540> one<00:02:57.780> on<00:02:57.930> this<00:02:58.020> side<00:02:58.230> is<00:02:58.380> going<00:02:58.530> to

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
short this one on this side is going to

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.350 
short this one on this side is going to
be<00:02:58.860> a<00:02:59.100> little<00:02:59.400> bit<00:02:59.610> shorter<00:03:00.170> and<00:03:01.880> this<00:03:02.880> side<00:03:03.150> is

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
be a little bit shorter and this side is

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.300 
be a little bit shorter and this side is
going<00:03:03.540> to<00:03:03.600> be<00:03:03.660> a<00:03:04.020> little<00:03:04.320> bit<00:03:04.590> longer<00:03:07.310> so

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
going to be a little bit longer so

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.540 
going to be a little bit longer so
you're<00:03:08.430> going<00:03:08.580> to<00:03:08.610> turn<00:03:08.880> it<00:03:09.030> and<00:03:09.180> repeat<00:03:10.550> so

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
you're going to turn it and repeat so

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:17.450 
you're going to turn it and repeat so
this<00:03:11.760> side<00:03:12.000> is<00:03:12.030> going<00:03:12.180> to<00:03:12.450> be<00:03:12.690> short<00:03:16.130> this<00:03:17.130> side

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:17.460 
this side is going to be short this side

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:21.860 
this side is going to be short this side
will<00:03:17.700> be<00:03:17.730> longer<00:03:20.090> and<00:03:21.090> then<00:03:21.300> this<00:03:21.450> one's<00:03:21.720> going

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
will be longer and then this one's going

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.860 
will be longer and then this one's going
to<00:03:21.930> be<00:03:22.140> a<00:03:22.170> little<00:03:22.470> bit<00:03:22.650> shorter<00:03:23.720> so<00:03:24.720> when<00:03:24.840> I

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
to be a little bit shorter so when I

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.070 
to be a little bit shorter so when I
come<00:03:25.080> over<00:03:25.110> here<00:03:25.560> this<00:03:25.830> one<00:03:26.040> is<00:03:26.160> short<00:03:26.840> so<00:03:27.840> this

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
come over here this one is short so this

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.970 
come over here this one is short so this
one's<00:03:28.320> going<00:03:28.590> to<00:03:28.620> be<00:03:28.800> long<00:03:30.500> this<00:03:31.500> one's<00:03:31.709> long

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
one's going to be long this one's long

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.370 
one's going to be long this one's long
so<00:03:32.610> this<00:03:32.760> one's<00:03:32.970> going<00:03:33.180> to<00:03:33.209> be<00:03:33.360> short<00:03:36.380> this

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380

so this one's going to be short this
one's<00:03:37.650> short<00:03:37.950> so<00:03:38.340> this<00:03:38.489> one's<00:03:38.700> going<00:03:38.850> to<00:03:38.910> be

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
one's short so this one's going to be

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.280 
one's short so this one's going to be
long<00:03:39.270> now<00:03:41.090> once<00:03:42.090> you've<00:03:42.300> set<00:03:42.510> this<00:03:42.660> down<00:03:42.900> and

sample you can see how we would just

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.940 
sample you can see how we would just
