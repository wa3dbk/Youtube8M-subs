00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.600
 the road building of the sky 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.230
 an exceptional voice that will link Saint-Pol to the salt-water pond it will put 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.230
 saint-pierre a nurse of saint-denis 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.270
 the corks of saint-leu and saint-gilles 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.130
 of cap lahoussaye became chronic 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.230
 since the late 90s 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.240
 period when the threshold of 30 thousand vehicles day was sliced 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.960
 and with traffic growing at an annual rate of nearly 10% 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.690
 circulation in the west becomes every year more critical 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.650
 after many years of studies and negotiations on the route of the 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:08.230
 road 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.480
 its construction was to be a priority for the region in 1998 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.450
 we were scared it was a road 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.910
 the coastline and the continuation in the 90s following discussions 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.090
 we reiterated that it needed a half-height road 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.550
 and so that in addition 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.650
 this troop can improve the traffic is the most 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.570
 it is road to develop the territory in particular the division 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.120
 to promote exchanges at the level of the elite life half-turn 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.170
 the choice of part-time passage 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.530
 thus liberates the western coastline and ranks its tourist vocation 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.410
 it also makes it possible to open up all the boroughs of the group 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.250
 by bringing them closer to the two major urban centers 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.370
 three-basins will be for example half an hour from saint-denis or 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:57.280
 Saint Pierre 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.370
 but also by facilitating transversal links 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.710
 ali boulahfa linz where a piton saint-leu will no longer be an adventure 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.069
 and fantastic opportunities for development do not offer these common 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.599
 the road of the tamarins celebrates the east in symbol by a work of art 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:18.159
 exceptional media of the camp form of s of a length of 750 meters 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:23.969
 the first 6 kilometers rubs twice three ways 

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:26.479
 because the very steep slope on this first stretch 

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:29.479
 it only takes a third way for amphibious vehicles 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:35.109
 this intermediate interchange located on average every four kilometers which 

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:38.109
 will allow quick access to all western cities 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:42.439
 the wet road at 300 meters altitude one had to pass 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:44.599
 big enough to play fully 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:45.969
 you have to give life back to your knees 

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:48.969
 but that implies that we must respect 

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:56.229
 works of art are slaughtered 

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:58.209
 two trenches covered at st 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:02:59.489
 the piton saint-leu 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.489
 the tunnel of more than 200 meters 

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:06.680
 it's about twenty funds 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.680
 to cross deep roots 

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:15.449
 four books are considered exceptional and require 

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:18.819
 techniques that have been implemented only a few copies on the 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:23.169
 planet of a viaduct of saint-paul the longest jump of 159 points 

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:25.809
 the delay of three basins behind us 

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:29.639

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:39.499
 an intermediate and the quebec on the gully fountain 180 meters also 

00:03:39.499 --> 00:03:42.779
 intermediate homeless

 environment preservation of flora and fauna 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.340
 but also the integration of the road in the landscape we were present all 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.340
 throughout the competition 

00:03:53.749 --> 00:03:55.279
 for each situation 

00:03:55.279 --> 00:03:58.279
 a different architectural response were brought 

00:03:58.789 --> 00:04:02.239
 for the property of the couple fleurimont hildebrand boucan canot 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:04.999
 for the purpose was to go into the savannah in the most gentle way 

00:04:04.999 --> 00:04:06.389
 france parent possible 

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:09.749
 yet that's what led to do to restore and flashes established and 

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:13.589
 offset we will see to allow transparent background on the savannah for the 

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:14.619
 road users 

00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:15.989
 also percent 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.989
 the interests of cbd grupo p 

00:04:22.059 --> 00:04:25.029
 the euro is declared of public utility in May 2002 

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:27.759
 cross about thirty farms 

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:31.349
 a collaboration with saf fr has made it possible to offer new surfaces 

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:34.370
 vacant 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.289
 even if the route to avoid as much as possible inhabited areas 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:40.440
 seventy homes were to be destroyed as here at piton saint-leu 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.099
 for the construction of the covered trench 

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:46.559
 every time the work is waiting for you to find a solution 

00:04:46.559 --> 00:04:49.559
 satisfactory for families 

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:54.080
 the construction site will cost 2 billion euros which represents a balloon of oxygen 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.270
 considerable 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:56.990
 for the Reunion economy 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.810
 1,500 direct jobs will be created 6 as much for indirect jobs 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.020
 it was anticipated that what we knew would be needed 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.139
 long duration 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:09.110
 very specialized and one more crane drivers and wholesale drivers 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:14.250
 gear formers in sheet metal in specialties and so we provided a little 

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:15.719
 nearly 500 young people 

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:19.719
 who now have some work have found the worker but a lot 

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:23.789
 have found work on the spot so there we have relatively well anticipated and 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:28.449
 we can say that we have about 4 more than 30% of the titleholder insurers 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:31.589
 ground that is personal 

00:05:31.589 --> 00:05:33.789
 but go away for me I arms taboos 

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:37.509
 would form a 7 km stretch which is considerable 

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:41.380
 the crossing of the ravines by the earthmoving machines and the point 

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:43.499
 critical for the progress of the construction site 

00:05:43.499 --> 00:05:46.699
 so we started by treating all the fields that independently 

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:49.639
 and as the works are built 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:50.680
 lucio 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.560
 practicable by the construction machinery to spy join to make my 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:55.719
 plot direction 

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:59.289
 this is an advantage allow to put medium-sized companies in parallel 

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:03.339
 from different companies and get back on schedule which are all 

00:06:03.339 --> 00:06:07.209
 likewise very common to achieve such after this title 

00:06:09.749 --> 00:06:12.320
 today multiple stretch of the trail 

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.379
 targets of a gigantic dotted in the landscape 

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:18.949
 they make more and more visible the route of an extraordinary road 

00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:21.650
 which will be open to early motorists 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:22.590
 of the year 2009
