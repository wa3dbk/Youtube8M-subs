it's all right to be upset it's all
right<00:01:52.399> to<00:01:52.720> be<00:01:54.070> bothered<00:01:55.070> because<00:01:55.340> change<00:01:55.729> is

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
right to be bothered because change is

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.309 
right to be bothered because change is
different<00:01:56.479> in<00:01:56.569> its<00:01:56.689> hard<00:01:56.869> and<00:01:57.079> it's<00:01:57.170> difficult

00:01:57.309 --> 00:01:57.319 
different in its hard and it's difficult

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:59.950 
different in its hard and it's difficult
sometimes<00:01:57.560> but<00:01:58.549> at<00:01:59.299> the<00:01:59.420> end<00:01:59.450> of<00:01:59.659> the<00:01:59.750> day<00:01:59.929> I

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
sometimes but at the end of the day I

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.179 
sometimes but at the end of the day I
think<00:02:00.200> that<00:02:00.770> the<00:02:01.069> though<00:02:01.460> the<00:02:02.090> major<00:02:02.950> trend<00:02:03.950> of

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189 
think that the though the major trend of

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:06.609 
think that the though the major trend of
all<00:02:04.909> the<00:02:05.060> weapon<00:02:05.299> changes<00:02:05.689> is<00:02:05.869> positive<00:02:06.439> and

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
all the weapon changes is positive and

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:08.740 
all the weapon changes is positive and
like<00:02:06.740> I<00:02:06.860> said<00:02:06.920> over<00:02:07.789> the<00:02:07.880> next<00:02:08.090> few<00:02:08.209> days<00:02:08.450> we're
