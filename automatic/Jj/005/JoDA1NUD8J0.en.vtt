00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
the same we had a little bit of

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.130 
the same we had a little bit of
progression<00:01:20.220> in<00:01:20.430> this<00:01:20.670> episode<00:01:21.180> but<00:01:21.689> not<00:01:21.869> much

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
progression in this episode but not much

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.020 
progression in this episode but not much
to<00:01:22.320> say<00:01:22.470> that<00:01:22.500> much<00:01:22.830> really<00:01:23.159> even<00:01:23.580> happened

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
to say that much really even happened

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.760 
to say that much really even happened
because<00:01:24.150> at<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.869> beginning<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.259> episode<00:01:25.619> I

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
because at the beginning the episode I

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.530 
because at the beginning the episode I
thought<00:01:25.979> we<00:01:26.130> were<00:01:26.280> going<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.610> be<00:01:26.790> getting<00:01:27.390> some

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
thought we were going to be getting some

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.060 
thought we were going to be getting some
places<00:01:28.080> but<00:01:28.170> he<00:01:28.320> finally<00:01:28.530> got<00:01:28.770> back<00:01:28.890> to

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
places but he finally got back to

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.490 
places but he finally got back to
necklace<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.820> we<00:01:30.509> come<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.780> find<00:01:30.960> out<00:01:31.229> that

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
necklace and we come to find out that

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.710 
necklace and we come to find out that
it's<00:01:31.950> still<00:01:32.340> broken<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:33.150> still<00:01:33.360> needs<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.689> be

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
it's still broken it still needs to be

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.620 
it's still broken it still needs to be
fixed<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:34.350> not<00:01:34.860> much<00:01:35.070> progression<00:01:35.939> on<00:01:36.150> that

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
fixed so not much progression on that

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.350 
fixed so not much progression on that
point<00:01:36.869> because<00:01:37.409> once<00:01:37.680> that<00:01:37.950> opens<00:01:38.159> up<00:01:38.790> that

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
point because once that opens up that

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.149 
point because once that opens up that
means<00:01:39.630> that<00:01:39.840> we'll<00:01:39.960> finally<00:01:40.229> find<00:01:40.619> out<00:01:40.799> whose

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
means that we'll finally find out whose
