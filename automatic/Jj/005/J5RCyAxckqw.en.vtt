 place name Debalcevo 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.580
 admit to reading this in the press 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.920

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.549
 civilians 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.320
 heart bleeds when you think about 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.420
 what position were those 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.759

 security forces fired on Donetsk nobody 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.810
 something not lamented about it 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.759
 there are also many towns and cities 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.799
 settlements and townships are simply compared to 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.380
 land as a result of america action 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.210
 on the Ukrainian security forces this 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.520
 significant reservation many 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.090
 noticed samantha power no more words 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.040
 took 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.009
 but the Russian permanent representative piled on 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.259
 american allies how is it that 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.450

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:01.450
 howitzer incomprehensible such things from the sky not 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:04.090
 fall now about 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.039
 weapons and so on and Lithuania in my opinion 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.780
 the only state who are honest 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:10.840
 frankly officially said that she 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.099
 delivers weapons not Kiev so it can 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.349
 to be something of Lithuanian weapons 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:16.810
 Chinese militia also falls 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:18.610
 the chairman tried to abstract and 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.410
 in the end wishing to give the word by 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.900
 several times though the regulations of this are not 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.489
 assumed we stand priest temper 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.560
 security council members please temper members 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:28.560
 council they continue to provoke me 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.730
 Ukrainian Permanent Representative unexpectedly spoke 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.330
 about violations of the state humanitarian border 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.370
 convoys of Russia illegally introduced so 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.170
 called 14 humanitarian convoy 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.970
 this was done without agreement with 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.459
 Ukraine and international mechanisms 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.530
 here and we called you all the time 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.060
 collaborate with us in organizing these 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.530
 convoys you always refused 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.840
 once for my reason suddenly 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.970
 looked deigned Ukrainian 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.400
 customs officers watch the convoy all 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.650
 the rest of the time we refused 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.569
 flirt with such questions no one 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.880
 let's just have to help people 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:05.950
 life saver to help survive the winter 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.870
 Permanent Representative of Ukraine Yuri Sergeev 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.049
 decided to switch to Russian 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.010
 lately almost never done 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:15.040
 mister chair from your 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.930
 permission will speak in Russian reserve 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.790
 for a living churkin when talking about 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.000
 political orientation of the current 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:24.250
 Kiev authorities here see here 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.840
 abominable among the inhabitants of the east 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.060
 national holiday new they 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.049
 proclaimed 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.389
 creation date of the Ukrainian insurgent 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:31.810
 Army collaborators is what they had 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:34.660
 to make 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.579
 and say what they have on the constitution 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.549
 I plan they did not say this is now 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:41.139
 trouble has been said is work is about what 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:43.980
 will be for centralization 

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:47.769
 with increasing powers to the authorities 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:52.000
 so once again I ask at least in this 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:55.660
 hall do not interfere our affairs ourselves 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.730
 decide how to live what to build and how to find 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.280
 dialogue with their own 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:03.819
 find the dialogue is necessary but find the dialogue then 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.290
 eventually find a dialogue 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:07.359
 can not establish this dialogue 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.150
 for a successful example of such a dialogue 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:12.250
 I did not have to go far our names on 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.750
 UK representative who is very 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.720
 worried that the situation on the peninsula 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.430
 overshadow the events in the southeast we 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.190
 we can not even answer one 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.889
 a word to all these statements of one digit 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:27.490
 now one digit this digit 93 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:28.990
 and recently a German agency that 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:32.250
 engaged in the study of public 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:35.380
 opinion polls residents of Crimea and 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:37.750
 came to the conclusion that ninety three 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:40.000
 percent of the inhabitants of the Crimea support 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.100
 reunion with russia last word 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.550
 permanent representatives left 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.550
 Russia
