00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
and we just kind of push it in I usually

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.710 
and we just kind of push it in I usually
like<00:01:20.310> pushing<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.640> top<00:01:20.939> in<00:01:21.150> first<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.630> then

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
like pushing the top in first and then

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.210 
like pushing the top in first and then
just<00:01:21.930> squeeze<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.320> bottoms<00:01:22.680> down<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.130> then

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
just squeeze the bottoms down and then

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.700 
just squeeze the bottoms down and then
it<00:01:23.340> fits<00:01:23.549> in<00:01:23.700> perfectly<00:01:23.729> fine<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:25.439> main

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
it fits in perfectly fine the main

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.280 
it fits in perfectly fine the main
difference<00:01:26.130> I<00:01:26.250> noticed<00:01:26.580> with<00:01:26.759> these<00:01:27.150> cases<00:01:27.750> as

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
difference I noticed with these cases as

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.710 
difference I noticed with these cases as
compared<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.890> previous<00:01:29.340> generation<00:01:29.720> 5

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
compared to the previous generation 5

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.810 
compared to the previous generation 5
cases<00:01:30.990> is<00:01:31.290> if<00:01:31.470> you<00:01:31.710> look<00:01:31.890> at<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.100> bottom<00:01:32.490> you

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
cases is if you look at the bottom you

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.370 
cases is if you look at the bottom you
can<00:01:32.970> see<00:01:33.000> that<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.450> bottom<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:33.750> all<00:01:33.900> covered

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
can see that the bottom is all covered

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.429 
can see that the bottom is all covered
and<00:01:34.590> if<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:35.159> look<00:01:35.369> at<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.729> case<00:01:36.450> right<00:01:37.110> here

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
and if you look at the case right here

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.390 
and if you look at the case right here
it<00:01:37.650> is<00:01:37.890> all<00:01:38.130> exposed<00:01:39.320> not<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.350> hugely<00:01:40.740> bad<00:01:41.130> thing

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
it is all exposed not a hugely bad thing

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.969 
it is all exposed not a hugely bad thing
I<00:01:42.030> do<00:01:42.540> like<00:01:42.810> having<00:01:43.079> that<00:01:43.350> full<00:01:43.530> protection

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
I do like having that full protection

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.490 
I do like having that full protection
around<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.399> but<00:01:44.640> I<00:01:44.850> do<00:01:45.479> like<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.990> thinness<00:01:46.229> I

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
around it but I do like the thinness I

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.039 
around it but I do like the thinness I
do<00:01:46.560> like<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.100> feel<00:01:47.729> of<00:01:47.759> these<00:01:48.000> cases<00:01:48.450> so<00:01:48.750> that

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
do like the feel of these cases so that
