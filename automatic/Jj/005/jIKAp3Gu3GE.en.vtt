 Canadian bombardier conducted tests of 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.140
 landing at the airport the nubia with 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.270
 in order to observe the conditions of the 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.310
 track for america verify if your 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.410
 airplanes work properly on ground 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.750
 manizaleños and thus be able to do business 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.449
 with the bianca which requires change of 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.679
 your flotilla let's talk with 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:32.809
 marcelo energy is the event 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:34.580
 meant to tell us that 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:36.320
 We are seeing the images you want 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.570
 treat this so much is in a 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.340
 acquisition of new aircraft for good 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.570
 that would surely help a lot 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.399
 all evils children and hot 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.890
 marcelo see very good afternoon and 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:47.420
 welcome to p-tv news and doctor 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.649
 mejía when it happens once of wanting 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.649
 treat this evil or what they did 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.329
 no exceptions of how you could 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.340
 verify in the signature as it is 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:00.519
 doing some tests for the 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.500
 acquisition of 15 aircraft and replace 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:05.080
 with these 15 grenades the fleet of 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.650
 fokker planes you have for routes 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:12.399
 intermediate and I had after the visit 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:16.180
 of a life of 400 of the company 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:20.100
 bombardier is a ship for 78 people 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.759
 and we can control the opinion that 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.420
 fortunately all the tests 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:28.539
 the plane came out very satisfactory 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:34.830
 landed on food of approximately 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:34.830
 of color in 800 and we are informed 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.830
 satisfaction and surely it can be very 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.990
 these devices obviously for the 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.820
 whole who is doing these tests and 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.320
 our our future something positive 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.260
 for the whole operation that in the 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.490
 Nubia airport people are better 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.369
 our planes then they are 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.960
 rehearsing those who have today 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.240
 avianca seems like conditions 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.900
 different more capacity than others 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.900
 differences have 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.860
 in freedom 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:19.989
 aeronautical in our country a balcony of 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.989
 the area where a surely for 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:28.720
 the operation and these are planes without 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.210
 generation with a superior capacity 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.390
 more compared to those with people 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:36.840
 of 27 many more people and obviously 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.580
 nowadays the latest technology hd 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.450
 its beginnings and efficiency that are very 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:45.010
 superior to the hackers you try 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.040
 Basically it's like as a little 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:51.290
 production comparison 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.290
 in addition to other technical things 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:55.799
 hopefully then for the good of the 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.469
 community 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:00.599
 We can hopefully have several in 

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:02.219
 society and planes to see pretty 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:03.930
 we are also very aware 

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:05.970
 of the news of the new 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.620
 approaches without further decorations with 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.359
 other airlines that can reach the 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.439
 city ​​of Manizales, since I launched 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:12.439
 we withdraw from you about it 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:20.890
 with the governor 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.290
 and with the committee between they point at the 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:27.250
 City Hall with different centers for 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:29.860
 the time of suffering in space has been 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.890
 come the lan company we are in those 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:35.500
 conversations and we're basically to 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:38.019
 waiting for a response from the 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.610
 hoop without stopping so they can let in 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:41.620
 operate the whole girl that in this case 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.549
 the company with which they are 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.549
 helped with passions 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.769
 overnight 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.620
 the important thing is that here the 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:59.739
 department perspectives are 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:02.110
 doing all the management to see how 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:04.770
 I say subscribe to the schools that 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.600
 were created with this line 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.890
 very well finally to leave it 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.030

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.300
 accompanies in news the ptv the 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.280
 radioaids that were about to reach the 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.769
 nubia airport we can already tell 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:20.729
 with these equipment 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:23.690
 and two weeks we had the 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:28.850
 visit of a long syndicated bond 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:32.980
 the art of monitoring the radio help 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.980
 reality is already underway 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.400
 from the engineering point of view of 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.920
 be unique in the other man to the city 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.380
 we hope that this whole process ends 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.720
 in the month of December so that during 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:49.529
 that month the respective tests are made 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:54.839
 and the center but in the month of January 

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:58.439
 and trying to be very optimistic but 

00:04:54.839 --> 00:05:00.029
 also very sensible in the grades that 

00:04:58.439 --> 00:05:02.579
 although it is to add it we hope that it 

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:04.709
 can study the books for the fair 

00:05:02.579 --> 00:05:07.909
