00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.219 

when<00:01:52.790> you're<00:01:52.909> playing<00:01:53.149> halftime<00:01:53.990> you<00:01:54.110> don't

ringing<00:01:58.250> I<00:01:58.790> mean<00:01:59.299> I<00:01:59.329> think<00:01:59.420> the<00:01:59.659> most

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
ringing I mean I think the most

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.190 
ringing I mean I think the most
distracting<00:02:00.439> thing<00:02:00.680> was

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
distracting thing was

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.990 
distracting thing was
people<00:02:01.590> have<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.860> flash<00:02:02.159> on<00:02:02.430> their<00:02:02.549> cameras

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
people have the flash on their cameras

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.639 
people have the flash on their cameras
and<00:02:03.270> you<00:02:03.390> go<00:02:03.539> to<00:02:03.600> hit<00:02:03.840> a<00:02:03.869> forehand<00:02:04.079> and<00:02:04.530> when

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
and you go to hit a forehand and when

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.100 
and you go to hit a forehand and when
you<00:02:04.710> have<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:04.920> flash<00:02:05.189> in<00:02:05.399> your<00:02:05.549> face<00:02:05.729> but<00:02:06.240> I<00:02:06.539> mean

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
you have a flash in your face but I mean

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.070 
you have a flash in your face but I mean
it<00:02:07.289> you<00:02:07.409> get<00:02:07.560> used<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:07.890> it<00:02:08.069> so<00:02:08.399> it's<00:02:08.879> easy<00:02:09.660> to

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
it you get used to it so it's easy to
