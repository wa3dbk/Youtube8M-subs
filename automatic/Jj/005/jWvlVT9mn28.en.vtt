way in my book it's like on the tuna the
voltage<00:06:19.590> its<00:06:20.590> moist<00:06:21.280> they<00:06:22.090> because<00:06:22.750> it's<00:06:22.900> the

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:23.020 
voltage its moist they because it's the

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:24.750 
voltage its moist they because it's the
part<00:06:23.169> where<00:06:23.410> there's<00:06:24.010> your<00:06:24.130> masters<00:06:24.460> is<00:06:24.610> as

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:24.760 
part where there's your masters is as

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.430 
part where there's your masters is as
much<00:06:25.000> so<00:06:25.780> it's<00:06:25.930> lovely

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:26.440 
much so it's lovely

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.610 
much so it's lovely
so<00:06:27.220> it's<00:06:27.610> rich<00:06:27.850> like<00:06:28.600> we<00:06:28.780> use<00:06:28.960> that<00:06:29.200> normally

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:29.620 
so it's rich like we use that normally

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:33.570 
so it's rich like we use that normally
for<00:06:29.800> canopy<00:06:30.990> so<00:06:31.990> we<00:06:32.380> do<00:06:32.590> a<00:06:32.620> little<00:06:32.830> learn<00:06:33.280> a

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:33.580 
for canopy so we do a little learn a

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.659 
for canopy so we do a little learn a
musical<00:06:34.020> it<00:06:35.020> moves<00:06:35.290> quickly<00:06:35.500> to<00:06:36.220> a<00:06:36.250> certain

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:36.669 
musical it moves quickly to a certain

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:39.780 
musical it moves quickly to a certain
even<00:06:37.120> seven<00:06:37.510> almost<00:06:37.780> four<00:06:38.320> and<00:06:38.590> it<00:06:39.400> will<00:06:39.610> be

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:39.790 
even seven almost four and it will be

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:44.590 
even seven almost four and it will be
full<00:06:40.830> public<00:06:41.830> sir

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:44.600 

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:49.060 

same<00:06:45.050> thing<00:06:45.380> there<00:06:45.590> and<00:06:47.290> then<00:06:48.290> you<00:06:48.410> just<00:06:48.440> like

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:49.070 
same thing there and then you just like
