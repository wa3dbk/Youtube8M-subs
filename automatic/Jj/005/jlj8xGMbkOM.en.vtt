00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:24.320
 strategic in commercial terms there

 behind me is charcoal stick 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:31.019
 Charcoal was born 26 years ago but 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.700
 in this that was the third branch that 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:38.290

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:51.160
 gastronomic temple in bogotÃ¡ and also 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:54.840
 details on how to prepare a 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.840
 finger-licking meat 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.740
 it is not very common to find yourself in one 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.560
 when is it going to be a story 

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:09.610
 gastronomic as special as today's

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:28.030
 coal charcoal restaurants that 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.790

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.310

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:37.180
 where they mounted the first the first one what 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:40.119
 we ride on the parallel with 103 go 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.850
 it was when they started charcoal stick and 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:44.950
 there we went to 18 with ninth and 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.160
 this is where we are now 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:52.000
 26 years that we are with the name of 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.740
 rare coal 26 years ago when it 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.040
 started the business 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:59.020
 alfonso was the restaurant's porter 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.390
 today he is the administrator of a story 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.490
 very beautiful that we are going to go telling you a 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.920
 bit stolen who were the first 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.500
 local heat customers were those 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:12.160
 people who came to shops a steak 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.410
 here in very common clients of 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.110
 Soon friends of the owner soon 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.870
 you can get to know us little by little 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.569
 they went as if updating in the brand 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.269
 and we entered, we entered very slowly because 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:27.209
 start was not easy, but but 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:29.709
 let's say in that part we were acquiring 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:32.049
 market we will let you know if it is 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.510
 an image that we have thanks to God 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:35.739
 very well taken care of personally I have the 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.590
 impression that this letter 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:41.049
 practically the same as 26 in the 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.209
 what we say is in draft for change 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:45.310
 for celia is with some corrections but 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:48.459
 it is already the letter that we have since 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.470
 we started and only renewed ones 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:53.739
 little touches but it is our letter 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:56.920
 traditional here of short churrasco 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:59.260
 Argentine thick cut let's say one what 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.170
 it handles how we handle it 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.120
 thick cut and we open it so it looks like 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.700
 butterfly style that is very good 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.709
 quality especially for its chubby that is 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.799
 what fascinates the customer that gives 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:13.120
 very good taste delicious good yo 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:17.530
 talking once with a barbecue 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:20.560
 argentinian in germany he told me that 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.810
 that the typically Argentine meat of 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.930
 Argentinian roast takes nothing 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:28.060
 the meat is put there and at the most it 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:31.209
 he throws a little salt is true that's 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.579
 true we only the meat is 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:36.190
 try let's say here with a maturation that 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:39.159
 it looks on the floor and here it comes is 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.500
 ride is given a touch of wine 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:44.230
 very soft a touch of salt is added to 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.359
 that's very very soft the rest comes like this 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.450
 directly to the table that is where the 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:51.819
 customer presents let's say your dressings 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.950

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:55.900
 saw something else for what one but 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.510
 not our flesh is almost a hundred 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.850
 original cent is not treated with anything 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.010
 let's say neither softened 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:06.760

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:16.150
 had in Argentina and saw the cut there and 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:19.120
 suddenly he did it here smith jane let's say

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:29.080
 placing the paprika appointments live 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:31.960

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:34.720
 fused is us for us the 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:37.000
 tenderloin to service so the people who 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:41.140
 easy test of the innovations of 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.360
 You, my dear, would name first 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.550
 place the sobrebarriga the citizenship is 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.060
 a very Colombian dish but you what 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.320
 they make grilled and treaty 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.180
 we will need we do to the family 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.580
 that when he loses the part he takes with 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.160
 the melted cheese then you go out like this 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:00.310
 practically with your companion when 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:03.590
 it's the criolla going with her cassava going with her 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:05.870
 dad did something that goes a lot 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:08.450
 that's also what makes him give a 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.590
 very Colombian touch and that's why it's called 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:12.110
 overblow the screen 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:16.340
 how nice now let's talk about the 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:19.220
 I think accompaniments that it is there 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:22.160
 is where the accent is with the most 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:24.080
 Colombians and of course the accompaniment of 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.550
 the meat has been our accompaniment 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.400
 very traditional 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:30.770
 the salad that has been tomato lettuce 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.260
 onion that party from there has not 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.510
 had another salad been replaced and 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:39.230
 his accompaniment of the meat that is the 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:41.300
 dad to dad with water creams in the 

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:43.640
 pita with cheese and a bananito for me 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:46.250
 side that is the very accompaniment 

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:48.230
 typical of the others that is 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:50.300
 the accompaniment of can be a 

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:52.820
 churrasco of a live or gave a tip 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:54.590
 diana I ask as goalkeeper 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:57.380
 a restaurant 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:59.450
 becomes the administrator and the 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:03.820
 character he knows best in history 

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:07.940
 of the site and I would say that the employee more 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:11.450
 admirable and most exemplary of the ss a 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:15.740
 merit and I do not earn it by being honest 

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:18.860
 with the company with its owner being 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:20.870
 loyal there is when the people or the owner 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:23.270
 look at this boy I can pick it up what 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:25.520
 I can have like when there was a team 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:27.410
 of football and if this player can 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:30.170
 serve to put it in this position what 

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:31.640
 prepare that happened to me and the future of the 

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:33.860
 company where they opened for me 

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:36.320
 all I believe that always one wants 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:39.920
 look at the future let's say with a margin 

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:42.590
 upwards soon from here to 23 years old or 

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:44.810
 if it can be good is to have another brand or 

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:47.210
 more small digits than what 

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:49.610
 requires a dad always wants 

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:51.640
 have digits on the sides and if something 

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:56.050
 It has a load of good dad 

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:56.050
 congratulations happy thank you very much thank you
