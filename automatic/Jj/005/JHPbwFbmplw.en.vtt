00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 and then everything right here is Daniel Mameluco and 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.020
 this one is a boot mark this new 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.840
 model called energy 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.969
 and if from here with composite nozzle to 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.769
 who does not know composite is a 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.740
 plastic component 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.990
 only of very high resistance to 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.830
 you have an idea it more resistant 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:25.980
 stronger than the lighter steel model 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.730
 is very light despite the protective nozzle 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.170
 and more convenient since it was not 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.989
 Import with metal detector by 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.800
 example banks or airports 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:41.730
 it is inside it it has a liner the 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:45.270
 lining made in 3d fabric artec a fabric 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.370
 until known for the purpose of 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.050
 maintain the internal temperature of the footwear 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.289
 always nice 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.890
 the strong part off footwear is made in 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:58.879
 microfiber a very malleable component a 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.800
 and soft tissue very resistant 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:04.049
 also contributes to maintaining 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.450
 the temperature of your always pleasant foot 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.420
 it does not stain when in contact with 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.610
 chemicals washable if you 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.549
 It works the use of footwear is a place with 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:18.150
 too much dust or with mud for example 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:20.820
 and the water-repellent does not repel the water I 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:24.240
 I will demonstrate here in the test the effectiveness 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.580
 that the microfiber stowage when it 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.979
 respect to water-repellent quality 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:34.079
 of the repellent, you realize you realize that 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:37.579
 the water there she runs she can not 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.590
 penetrate the fabric into microfiber 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:42.689
 interesting feature 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:46.140
 often even fundamentally depending on 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:48.750
 the type of work the site type 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.430
 you will use this footwear is a 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.939
 footwear approved by the Ministry of 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:57.630
 I work as a safety footwear, right? 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:59.820
 he even by the beak his side 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.740
 it is also a sole approved by the 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.829
 ministry of labor as one with a 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.409
 non-slip floor 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:09.360
 it also resistant to oil corrosion 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.890
 fuel you can step on oil 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:16.379
 fuel that it does not corrode 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:19.709
 has anti-electric shock treatment 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:22.440
 so it also prevents user from 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.269
 to take much sought after electric shock 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.290
 including by electricians for this 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:30.870
 reason has a very cool design here 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.590
 This is a beautiful drawing that 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:38.269
 a component that allows your foot to rotate 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:40.200
 avoiding some kind of twisting energy 360 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:41.819
 here too. 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.680
 present in this template 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:49.200
 in short a safety footwear the 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.790
 professional past with several 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.630
 characteristics and components of 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:57.450
 safety and not casual appearance is a 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.390
 tractor when it comes to 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.950
 safety components and accessories 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.500
 but you can put the 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.750
 shopping comfort size such a 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.989
 his beauty and his style well 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:12.120
 nice then is steve webster the energy 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:16.280
 east from here with a composite spout 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.280
