00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.949
 that's all the Tuchels he wanted to polish 

00:00:57.499 --> 00:00:59.860
 because it does not absorb moisture 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.330

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:25.909
 Lehmann Brothers 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:29.140

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.360
 we are already angry 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:50.979
 and around 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:54.020
 Bring tingling shots full 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.210
 Take it from the plastic bag 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.280
 we see already 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.560
 this will look really good here 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.560
 I mean, that's what it's all about 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.669

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:11.669
 Sepang 

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:14.429

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:20.649
 the whole 

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:23.509
 get rich out of here 

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:24.859
 and around 

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:27.719
 win the number one 

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:30.719
 they have to leave first 

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:37.589
 but it has to be a bit like that 

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:40.589
 Dresens seemed to work 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:45.049
 and then 

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:49.729
 NATO is on display 

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:52.729
 as accurately as possible 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:08.329
 what identifies Markus Mensching year or 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:12.419
 eat 

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:13.819
 With 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:17.259

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:20.689
 very nice 

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:22.369
 Commentators go 

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:25.939
 m and is synonymous when applying human still no bubbles 

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:27.659
 then of course you have to give 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:30.659
 at the same time took off to pull away 

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:51.039
 Seamus province 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:02.769
 so that he already does 

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:06.279
 the supporters on 

00:04:06.279 --> 00:04:09.599
 Small are here but a few small scratches 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:10.929
 they disappear 

00:04:10.929 --> 00:04:12.599
 cheerfully 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:14.109
 Witnesses can start at 10 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:15.679
 and now you see 

00:04:15.679 --> 00:04:17.189
 the right one 

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:18.909
 Game effect 

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:20.870
 I think that's similar 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.389
 Cremer colossus 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:26.039
 we are as seen 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:28.669
 which has not been created yet 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:29.770
 Arber 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.080
 Grotholt Wissmann 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.300
 Magnin bit over, the Red wins the fingerprints 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.020
 but I'm honest impression that she was really horny 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.080
 Geismar 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.779
 the nomads are pushing 

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:44.779
 No, that does not have to read now 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:50.900
 this is not the cool one here is the playing field if you are up to four 

00:04:50.899 --> 00:04:53.899
 but it shimmers but breaks anyway 

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:57.779
 We can bring and you can use the normal 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.050
 without him because of difficulties 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:09.150
 we can see that also by the lamp 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.199
 the court classes off 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:12.680
 as well as painting 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.360
 Molitor closer 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.659
 here you see 

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:17.700
 for reflection 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.159
 and there is in 

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:24.159
 So that Essers really cool really 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:27.349
 that too with self-discovery 

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:28.439
 round 

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:30.479
 That's where the deform 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:32.439
 just under 3 euros 

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:34.199
 really worth it 

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:35.229
 and h 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:38.229
 I will definitely think I will continue to order 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.210
 I'm really impressed 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:45.210
 even more is called in which aborted as I with it 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:46.729
 get along that way 

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:50.270
 and in any case, these KÃ¶lle do not make CAD so fast again 

00:05:52.069 --> 00:05:53.550
 otherwise 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:56.589
 is not much to say please deposit my videos 

00:05:57.289 --> 00:06:00.219

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:01.900
 and around 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.050
 In the future, more videos will follow in any case 

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:06.589
 See you 

00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:07.159
 even more relaxed
