an Oakley visor on this thing for the

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.330 
an Oakley visor on this thing for the
relative<00:00:40.290> speed<00:00:40.730> but<00:00:41.730> I<00:00:42.860> figured<00:00:43.860> out<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.040> way

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
relative speed but I figured out a way

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:52.459 
relative speed but I figured out a way
as<00:00:44.399> you<00:00:44.640> can<00:00:44.910> see<00:00:45.149> see<00:00:45.840> it's<00:00:46.680> in<00:00:48.590> it's<00:00:49.590> in<00:00:51.469> look

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
as you can see see it's in it's in look

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:59.869 
as you can see see it's in it's in look
inside<00:00:52.860> it's<00:00:53.489> in<00:00:54.020> and<00:00:55.460> it's<00:00:56.460> in<00:00:56.989> and<00:00:58.730> the<00:00:59.730> only

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
inside it's in and it's in and the only

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.049 
inside it's in and it's in and the only
way<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:00.180> I<00:01:00.570> found<00:01:00.870> out<00:01:01.079> how<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.350> do<00:01:01.590> it<00:01:01.770> was<00:01:02.550> if

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
way that I found out how to do it was if

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:09.620 
way that I found out how to do it was if
you<00:01:03.300> take<00:01:03.329> off<00:01:03.719> this<00:01:06.830> the<00:01:07.830> cage<00:01:08.270> if<00:01:09.270> you<00:01:09.420> take

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
you take off this the cage if you take

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.649 
you take off this the cage if you take
that<00:01:09.750> off<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:10.670> then<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:11.820> put<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.180> clips<00:01:12.450> on

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
that off and then you put the clips on

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.140 
that off and then you put the clips on
and<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:13.020> push<00:01:13.290> it<00:01:13.320> in<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:13.950> then<00:01:14.010> hold<00:01:14.760> it<00:01:14.970> in

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
and you push it in and then hold it in

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.910 
and you push it in and then hold it in
and<00:01:15.390> screw<00:01:15.630> it<00:01:15.750> in<00:01:15.900> that<00:01:16.320> should<00:01:16.560> work<00:01:16.710> and

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
and screw it in that should work and

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.490 
and screw it in that should work and
then<00:01:17.040> just<00:01:17.340> assemble<00:01:17.970> it<00:01:18.090> back<00:01:19.080> with<00:01:19.380> these

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
then just assemble it back with these

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.320 
then just assemble it back with these
screws<00:01:19.799> and<00:01:20.250> these<00:01:20.400> push<00:01:20.670> points<00:01:21.090> now<00:01:21.210> these
