00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 hello and choupette so today 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.140
 I come with the tag of paimboeuf 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.780
 palette so that was asked by 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.059
 many of you so it's a 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.460
 text that will actually talk about pallets 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.160
 preferred briefcases we would like 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.060
 taken away from most palaces the most 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.060
 rotten finally here 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:27.970
 then the best pallet packaging 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:30.590
 so I loved and hal gill two 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.620
 palettes to introduce to you I loved them 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.050
 packaging i have the pallet from mac 

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:38.480
 like this one so I really liked 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.970
 the box so and flew in capital 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.280
 is no sooner and fleece like a 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.930
 sofa actually we'll say with the little 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.530
 jessy who really does everything always 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:50.659
 tie to me and I also liked the 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.609
 packaging of it so the pretty 

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:54.460
 woman from among all faced that I 

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:57.940
 really liked she's really rock 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.940
 really rebellious 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.190
 then the same I have several you 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.019
 present because here is course at 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.470
 pallet level I really do not get to 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.570
 decide me 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.510
 then you have this one so the baÃ¯se 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.220
 pallet from home decay that I have 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.200
 so really kiffed at the level of 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.390
 colors because there are a lot of 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.850
 different colors so in the 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.500
 neutral in the colorful in the pop and 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.560
 frankly she is really complete 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.060
 at the color level so this one and 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.220
 I also liked the overall policy 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.320
 therefore I did everything with colors 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.289
 which are sumptuous they are really 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.890
 pretty golden finally they are really 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:33.890
 very very beautiful 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.399
 I could not find a pallet 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.619
 complete because in fact I rarely 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:43.329
 pallets where there is everything inside 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:46.719
 but the one I have at least the most 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:48.700
 complete that of mac so here where 

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:50.409
 we have eyeshadow you have the 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.319
 browser and you have lipsticks 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:55.240
 just below here so here is the 

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:57.520
 palette that I have the most complete if 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.959
 the rest is really pallets where 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.179
 there are only eyeshadows or that 

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:02.890
 veiling blushers buy 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:05.640
 rarely pallets where there are both 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.349
 wines I prefer to differentiate the two 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.149
 if not at the level of blushes the 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:12.459
 more complete I finally have one of 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:16.209
 more complete is this one from home 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:19.030
 nars so there guy bourdin so that's so 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:21.069
 the one night stand pallet so this one 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.340
 because you have brothers highlighter 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:26.530
 and 4 blushes and the same in the same 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.170
 principle you have this one from kiko 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.790
 that I really liked because she is 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.319
 really so affordable and she's 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.670
 super pretty and so from paris thirty and 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:35.860
 a few euros so 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.019
 ditto with a highlighter a browser that 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:42.000
 are super super beautiful really bright 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:42.000
 and four pretty blushes here 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.810
 so I'm the one I took 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.450
 always taken with me on a trip 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.770
 the cilic palette and my opinion saw them 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.210
 traces that has it on so it's 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.720
 really that I will really take away 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.030
 all over 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.830
 so it's a bit broken up so 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.570
 the a little smashed a bit inside 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.450
 but really I have them a lot 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:03.610
 a lot a lot a lot used in 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.930
 trip so I take it all the time 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.010
 because she is small to take and 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.940
 she really is she really has 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.370
 super pretty colors 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:12.040
 see them highlighter frozen really well 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.020
 well used so that's the 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.300
 better to travel for me so a 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.160
 small saw like that otherwise you have 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:21.280
 also the little smoky from make up 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.690
 for ever who is that so really 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.250
 good for traveling because it is 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.450
 really small and you have plenty of 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.120
 pretty colors inside you have 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.940
 colors here clear you have some 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.810
 colors in the chestnuts of colors 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.580
 a little more pop 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.930
 you have the black mount inside that 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.800
 is always good to have a 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.800
 black in a palette 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:43.460
 my biggest regret it was to force 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.760
 to see that I did not use it and actually 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.870
 that the colors did not hold the 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.370
 first I used I was great 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.130
 happy I said to myself this is a 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.060
 good range but this one is 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:56.060
 the one at mac's 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.050
 here are the colors I am not understood 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.150
 why the colors were not 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.400
 really also pigments tic in the 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.040
 other pallets or even in the 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.200
 normal headlights from mac there you see 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.760
 I wish you in the pink here I am 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.480
 find that he is not hyper hyper 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.900
 pigmented finally here I do not have 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.090
 find 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.560
 this is one of the pallets 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.100
 that I have the least - really the least 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.110
 in use 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.600
 I had to use once or twice 

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:22.010
 three so that's my biggest 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.190
 regret we will say it especially me 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:27.140
 cost 50 6 euros so frankly or 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:31.960
 that's 56 euros she's really 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:31.960
 really not where from there so well ben too bad 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.400
 but in two colors I liked 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.430
 color names of the pallet weiss 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:42.449
 so for example you have the fruit buzz 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:45.960
 so free of the free bird anonymous 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:47.940
 anonymous a marine effect so it's not 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.979
 of problem finally that's provocative 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:54.000
 here I really liked junkie even 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:56.630
 such desperation news so mu jack 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.630
 endless bend 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:01.620
 I will explain why I did not 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.580
 not used so I bought them I was 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.190
 really happy 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.440
 and this is the book of shadows of 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.360
 at urban decay and you understand 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.610
 why I did not use often 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.920
 because she's really fat and 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.690
 a lot a lot of packaging 

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:18.810
 for nothing so cross the wind the 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:20.940
 mirror a change never serves me 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:23.370
 I've never been used apart from opening 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:25.110
 when I want to watch and so here it is 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.210
 must really draw the big drawers 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.560
 it's a shame that there is such a big 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.570
 packaging for a palette like that 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:33.360
 especially that the colors are nice and 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:35.220
 So here I except this one that 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.750
 is the zephyr so I used often 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.020
 to put in voters at the level of 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.600
 eyes 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:41.100
 the rest I did not use much 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.360
 for it's a shame because the 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.630
 colors are really well pigmented 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.630
 as well 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.840
 the most used the most loved one and has 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.270
 taken to a deserted island 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.620
 so that's the one I started 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:56.740
 use ya not very long ago 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:58.320
 it's the year of the 3 so here and also 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:01.510
 she does not worry one 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:04.330
 so here it is the two two pallets 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:06.520
 darling one is so on a misery a 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:08.410
 desert island we mean if he really 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.000
 had to remain just a few 

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:14.800
 because here are colors 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 really pretty here you have so 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.620
 different colors on both 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.260
 pallets in you have colors a 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:22.270
 a little fed up with honeyed gray etc 

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:24.700
 at the bottom it's a little pink and a little 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:27.400
 more plums and so here are the two 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:29.650
 pallets that I will take months to them on 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:32.140
 a video is deserted and I can not 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:34.060
 choose one of the two so I wear 

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:35.740
 people wear both years 

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:37.840
 and one last for the road I know 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:39.970
 that those related not on the taxer so 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:41.919
 previously presented to present the 

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:44.200
 home lights they are great 

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:48.250
 well it's the pallets in glock so 

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:50.200
 really the colors already the ehpad 

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:51.310
 are really big so the little ones 

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.560
 squares there without really scolding case 

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:56.139
 a lot a lot of products on a 

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:57.970
 only one quarter and the colors are 

00:06:56.139 --> 00:06:59.260
 super pretty is really pigmentation 

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:02.440
 nothing wrong 

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:04.090
 and here I play either quickly 

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.130
 colors look like they are 

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:07.990
 beautiful 

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:09.669
 I wish you here green so they 

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:14.190
 are really very silly so this one 

00:07:09.669 --> 00:07:18.040
 same if you had to add a donkey 

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:20.830
 a title at tac I would say here I 

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:23.889
 would say more pigmented quality report 

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:29.260
 price I would say it's 6 6 7 2 among the 

00:07:23.889 --> 00:07:31.780
 lot schering headlights sees the beasts 

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:33.820
 for the tag may not be there I hope 

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:35.590
 that you liked it if you have any 

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:37.300
 questions about the palettes impose my 

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:39.430
 calmly under the video if you the 

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:41.590
 video you liked click on I like 

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:42.700
 do not forget about everything and I make you 

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:46.050
 very big kisses and I tell you to the 

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:46.050
 next video to see the pretty
