00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:07.620
 the story of a whole continent 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:11.820
 to provide more than almost 400 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.860
 years from 1444 to 1820 that is now 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.859
 not an easy task 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.510
 At the same time, Europa Universalis 4 is involved 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.430
 his name even modest 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.840
 to the extensive game world of the 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.789
 strategy game belongs namely 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.390
 By no means leaving good old europe 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.460
 but also asia arabia and 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.920
 the new continents beyond 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.800
 to colonize the sea is considered 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.360
 Chief of one of 250 nations 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.730
 we succeed through the centuries too 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.590
 do and lead growth sounds like 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.809
 civilization until yet 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.789
 more complex we need to research 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.160
 and big ideas business and commerce 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.710
 diplomacy and politics religion and 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.219
 missions as well as military and expansion 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.469
 To take care of 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.960
 in europe universalis 4 is so 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.640
 enough play for the next 20 years 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.360
 remains only the question whether there was also 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.360
 is funny 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.600
 europa universalis 4 is the youngest 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.180
 Part of a series originally called 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.800
 then board game implementation began more 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.630
 more surprising that the game is different 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.190
 as the mentioned civilization not 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.810
 Round for round but almost in 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.759
 real time runs out 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.680
 Speed takes a game day one 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:20.780
 second or only fractions of it 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.790
 claim the game can be played at any time 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.190
 interrupt manually to give commands 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.320
 and also interrupt automatically if 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.360
 important happens that must first 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.280
 be configured a bit cumbersome 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.960
 the time is well spent with it 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.660
 one not later about invaders 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.880
 go unnoticed in the back on the 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.619
 divided provinces in hundreds 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.450
 playing card we move troops and 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.399
 give the order about the 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.259
 increase tax revenues in a sector 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:47.300
 or increase the defense value 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:49.070
 We perform most of the other actions 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.080
 in the extensive menu on the left 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.399
 screen edge from the acts on the 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.140
 first look with all his 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:56.210
 buttons and show pretty nice 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.950
 intimidating and in fact we have 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.080
 a while needed to look through here 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.970
 that many symbols and buttons still with 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.250
 gibberish are due to it 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.500
 that in our first trial many 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.880
 texts were not finished in 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.530
 the final version was the 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.300
 labels are correct 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.480
 but we could not all 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.069
 scenes turn the different ones 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.200
 Game areas also show up 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:19.970
 the research is different in many ways 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.620
 for example, it runs differently than in 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.360
 earlier parts of the series largely 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.069
 automatically we only give the 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.170
 about whether he prefers the 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.180
 increase the productivity of our businesses 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.220
 or with new ship types ours 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.440
 expand trade and navy 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.540
 the interior politicians also prove themselves 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.129
 not too extensive, we a year 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.200
 couple of consultants to us bonuses in 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:40.879
 promise different areas and 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.849
 Collect stability points around the 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:45.500
 to strengthen the cohesion of our empire 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:47.120
 much more sophisticated is there already 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.680
 diplomacy we are allowed with our 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.690
 neighbors alliances form with you 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.670
 loans support states 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.900
 arrange or sent to 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.610
 improving our relationships 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.349
 we can turn off rivals 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.510
 for example with embargos or 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:00.130
 The insult should provoke us 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.710
 sense 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.080
 Why are other countries without reason 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.040
 Although it is possible to ambush us 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.110
 but in the eyes of the international 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.870
 community quickly as a warmonger 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.920
 but to find the conflict reason is 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.660
 not difficult too 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.420
 it is enough if our diplomats 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.340
 the claim to foreign territory 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.480
 fabricate the warfare 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.310
 Finally, one of the 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.770
 most comprehensive game components of 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.360
 commanding europe universalis 44 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.580
 associations of one or more 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.890
 battalions infantry cavalry and 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.990
 guns the controls are designed 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.880
 wonderfully simple we set ours 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:36.120
 troops just by mouse click in march 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.770
 Battles automatically cut them out 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.240
 who emerges victorious from an encounter 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.430
 depends on a whole series of 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.230
 Factors of course of the man strength 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.210
 but also from the composition of the 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.520
 fighting groups the explored weapons 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:50.410
 terrain and weather of moral quality 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.810
 the assigned generals and not 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.340
 at last simply struggling with luck 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.150
 on the high seas run after one 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.710
 similar pattern 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.660
 however we can do something here 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:01.210
 dusel sometimes enemy ships capers 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.910
 and incorporate our own fleet 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:05.980
 another interesting aspect of 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.870
 europa universalis 4 is the belief 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.060
 several religions are wrestling and the 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.580
 domination catholicism against 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.310
 Protestantism Christianity against Islam 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.989
 buddhism against china hinduism the im 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.700
 shamanism and so on 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.290
 the different directions 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.150
 Do not worry only between countries 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:25.090
 constantly for ignition but often too 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:27.190
 a real game within the states 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.200
 there is a goal in europe universalis four 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.060
 not even apart from that 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.660
 something put on acting points 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.490
 display 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.500
 we just have to do the best for ours 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.300
 nation can do that for one 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.130
 underdeveloped island realm in the distance 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.510
 asia just mean the 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.190
 foreign desires 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.200
 thwart colonial powers 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.820
 as one of the powerful European 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.730
 States are more opportunities 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:50.890
 open our borders from those for one 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:52.690
 coastal discover the social 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:54.970
 and advancing technical progress 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:59.100
 in short, we write history 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:59.100
 in a very entertaining way 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:05.300
 Technically, Europa Universalis shows itself 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.310
 four very conservative at times nice 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.440
 although the express extends 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.750
 but world map in three dimensions works 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:14.060
 nevertheless functionally two-dimensional 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:16.280
 just like the units menus and 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.930
 play worlds for it clear and that 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.540
 is not in a strategy game yes 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:22.640
 the catchy one does not matter 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:24.980
 classical orchestral music the good 

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:27.050
 graphics partially recovers anyway 

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:28.730
 Europa Universis is four parts 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.070
 no graphic or acoustic 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:32.660
 excellent title but it has to be synonymous 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:34.480
 not be of such a strategy 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:37.250
 Essentially, we expect epos 

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:43.400
 content qualities and that can 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:45.440
 convince as his predecessor is 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.750
 europe universalis four a game for 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:49.760
 specialists who like 100 hours or 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:51.320
 invest more in the title than who 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.850
 the former parts do not know who will 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.230
 Already 10 to 20 hours 

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:56.150
 have to plug in until he gets that 

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:58.220
 game system and all the complicated ones 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.810
 has seen through the connections 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.960
 tutorials hardly help here 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:04.580
 continue who but ryan fox will be with 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.590
 a very varied 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:08.419
 strategy game rewards every game 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.919
 runs differently there are always again 

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:12.650
 new strategies to try 

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:14.419
 new things you can discover too 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:16.880
 However, veterans are still over 

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:18.650
 the little intuitive control grumble 

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:20.419
 Although simplified compared to earlier 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:23.150
 but was still in many places 

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:24.919
 But it seems unnecessarily complicated 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:26.900
 if some game components like that 

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:29.479
 research unintelligible flat advised 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:31.669
 are europe universalis four of the 

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:34.210
 so far best part of the traditional 

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:34.210
 series
