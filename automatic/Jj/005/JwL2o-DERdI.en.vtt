00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.330

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.860
 I have had a lot in the last time 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.109
 I never really had to do that 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:24.289

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:25.970

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:29.840
 Drink this video then we start 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.460
 maybe with my hair care 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.960
 routine some of you, we have taken 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.629
 I thought so then 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.780
 I'll do it once we start with 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:42.469
 the with the shampoo with the care and 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:45.370
 although I have 1 1 for half a year 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:48.699
 taken from garnier fructis 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.659
 really cool shampoo so there is 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:52.280
 terribly good I do not know if we 

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:56.389
 ever smelled of this shampoo 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.260
 I smell that delicious and me 

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:58.339
 it still read a bit 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.779
 Influence when I have my hair 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:00.619
 have washed or is not that 

00:00:59.779 --> 00:01:02.420
 rinse 

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:05.089
 my hair is still adjusting 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.219
 I 'll take that shampoo too 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.390
 a flush I unfortunately all but now 

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:09.979
 maybe it's up to you 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.670
 just that I take both and both 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:16.520
 smells so extremely good and yes that is one 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.500
 color protector so for people who die 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.600
 hair dye or something is maybe 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.250
 not so bad there gabs before 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.530
 namely another version it was 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.030
 a normal hair shampoo without color 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.679
 At least then I believe that protects me 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.109
 believe that is relative to the one 

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:32.539
 main part well, no matter in any case 

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:36.259
 It is a very very very horny 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:38.179
 shampoo though, this was kabul he 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:40.009
 and I thought billions 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:43.130
 try now something else I was 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:44.810
 am always open for new and have got there 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.850
 I just because he brought because it 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.200
 on the rhine was and totally great 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.090
 I think that's one 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:56.190
 Repair shampoo without silicone deep 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:59.170
 Care for damage does not smell good 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:02.290
 not good but no comparison too 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.610
 my other there is sometimes but also 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.200
 be very good for the hair 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.300
 but I can not really handle it 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.759
 make friends that is now almost empty 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.520
 and I'm glad that my 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.930
 favorite shampoo again brought as 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.910
 Next, when I washed my hair 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.030
 I wrapped them in a towel 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:26.080
 have and halfway dry group days 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:28.209
 I use a conditioner and I have it 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.640
 I've been taken there for a year now 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:33.760
 blizzoli series that's the wife of his 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.270
 ratings and that's for very good 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.610
 fighter kite for shine and 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:42.010
 suppleness for color also satisfies 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:45.370
 really really cool really right 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:48.100
 So I love this shows namely without 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.200
 shit the hair in a dom so delicious 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.440
 level on how to do that 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:57.310
 Power on and that is really one too 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:02.350
 Darling of me there I still have 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:05.110
 the long series and that is for 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.730
 fine flat and damaged hair that 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.989
 However, it does not smell as good as that 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.130
 others I do not have that either 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:12.250
 buy again 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.300
 I am very open for something new but what 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:19.360
 I did not have to feel good 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:22.269
 make sure to pick it up again then 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:26.170
 I was at dm yesterday and still have 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:30.640
 such a series or was it the orange 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:32.230
 Indian so to speak and 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.540
 lincoln that's why it's two colors 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:37.420
 mini here it is if you like it 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.709
 then i will mix it up 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.250
 not yet tried from therefore can 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:44.490
 I do not say so but if that 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:48.270
 else was good in that can not even 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:54.480
 be totally shit 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:59.170
 i can tell if i have my hair like that 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:01.810
 dried halfway there I take an oil 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.130
 on by liszt cool and does that 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.600
 sweat in the length and in the 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.640
 be sharp as me after form two 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.610
 always pump my fingers and go 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:13.060
 so that through the hair and through 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:14.920
 Let it dry over if I do 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.690
 that's what I did when 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.570
 My hair is completely dry 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.709
 I use battery from Schwarzkopf 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.620
 glittering parade 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:25.450
 that is also the oberhammer really me 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.060
 have never had such a great country 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:30.130
 sprenger has had, and if you have it 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.620
 on it makes and a drying is 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.240
 it's shiny immediately so you have it 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.830
 a nice shine in the hair 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.160
 I do not know what blond is like 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:41.710
 combi color effects about it as in 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:44.290
 black-haired but that's for 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.370
 dark haired real a dream sprayer 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:52.360
 necessarily make 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:53.979
 that is a brilliant styling spring though 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.169
 I then go away and give me my hair 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:05:00.180
 of course you need leaves 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:03.370
 winter sports protection spray heat protection 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:05.020
 now again and thus that of 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.220
 Schwarzkopf from the husband like that you have 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.470
 even with my other video 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.840
 seen that is synonymous really something speak 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:14.900
 in the hair 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:18.620
 lure then you can start 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:22.400
 even to the last 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:24.870
 I use invites own henning 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:28.500
 ours has a very nice one 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:31.889
 color and baby blue pink and so on 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:33.300
 that goes up to 210 degrees I think that's good 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:34.440
 is also that one has the one ad 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.389
 and have a present like high or 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.190
 low that many have invites you to 

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:39.540
 for not only had I 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.130
 kind of an extra coating like that 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:43.320
 the hair is going to break me so much 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:47.940
 I do not know that, but I have to 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:49.169
 I really like it very well 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.669
 have never been with another of the 

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:53.010
 Smooth from that, I can not say 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:55.800
 but I've had that for five years now 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:58.530
 I think 5 or 4 405 years I have 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.430
 that and I never want that again 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:04.530
 let go 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:06.510
 I love it with those also can 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:07.979
 I conjure super beautiful curls 

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:10.550
 We do not know if this is in my photos 

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:10.550
 have seen 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:23.950
 2 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:26.200
 Do you want me to lure you ? 

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:29.710
 make video and I show as I with 

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:31.990
 The hair straightener next to get and 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:35.470
 yes write in the comments we see 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:37.720
 wanted that it was already too 

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:39.570
 my hair care routine 

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:43.300
 I hope you liked the video 

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:44.440
 So for that I have to say I go 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.540
 not too much higher 

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.340
 I've been a dream of forever 

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:50.170
 been me I let rarely 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:52.090
 you should not cut the points 

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:52.720
 after monza before should always be pointed 

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:56.500
 1 

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:58.870
 but because I love my hair so much 

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:01.930
 and by no means would that want there 

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:03.970
 something comes off in the year I have to go with 

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:06.210
 I do not live my game 

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:09.550
 really much but under the microscope 

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:14.080
 you would already have a few hair structure 

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:16.390
 recognize mistakes yes take care of your have 

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:19.290
 every case good and pretty much strained 

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:23.800
 Too much the hair grows very slowly 

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:26.950
 and i think nice hair should too 

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:29.620
 to be cared for and long hair straight 

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:32.490
 they should be taken care of for a long time 

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:34.900
 broken hair does not want to look nice and 

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:36.790
 I hope you liked my video 

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:38.260

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:40.390
 above, I would be very happy 

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:42.750
 Thanks for your support 

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:46.060
