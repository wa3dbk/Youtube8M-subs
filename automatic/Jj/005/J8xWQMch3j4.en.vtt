the water firm down in the rapids right

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.570 
the water firm down in the rapids right
there<00:04:08.090> because<00:04:08.450> I<00:04:08.920> think<00:04:09.920> it's<00:04:10.160> a<00:04:10.250> little<00:04:10.370> bit

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580 
there because I think it's a little bit

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:11.170 
there because I think it's a little bit
fresher

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
fresher

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.940 
fresher
if<00:04:11.810> the<00:04:11.930> water<00:04:12.110> is<00:04:12.260> moving<00:04:12.410> because<00:04:12.800> I<00:04:12.830> know

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
if the water is moving because I know

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.699 
if the water is moving because I know
pawns<00:04:13.420> they<00:04:14.420> sit<00:04:14.690> still<00:04:14.930> for<00:04:14.990> too<00:04:15.290> long

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:15.709 
pawns they sit still for too long

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:17.380 
pawns they sit still for too long
see<00:04:15.980> this<00:04:16.070> water<00:04:16.280> isn't<00:04:16.549> really<00:04:16.850> moving<00:04:17.000> I

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:17.390 
see this water isn't really moving I

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.800 
see this water isn't really moving I
think<00:04:17.720> it<00:04:17.989> kind<00:04:18.140> of<00:04:18.170> murky<00:04:18.620> and<00:04:18.739> stagnant<00:04:19.280> so

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
think it kind of murky and stagnant so

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.270 
think it kind of murky and stagnant so
that's<00:04:20.810> why<00:04:20.989> I<00:04:21.260> grabbed<00:04:21.590> it<00:04:21.680> down<00:04:21.829> there<00:04:22.040> some

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
that's why I grabbed it down there some

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.659 
that's why I grabbed it down there some
nice<00:04:22.720> clean<00:04:23.720> pretty<00:04:24.230> much<00:04:24.410> Aquafina<00:04:25.100> Dasani

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
nice clean pretty much Aquafina Dasani

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:28.600 
nice clean pretty much Aquafina Dasani
water<00:04:25.960> and<00:04:26.960> I<00:04:26.990> filled<00:04:27.890> it<00:04:27.980> all<00:04:28.040> the<00:04:28.220> way<00:04:28.310> to<00:04:28.340> the

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
water and I filled it all the way to the

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.159 
water and I filled it all the way to the
top<00:04:28.820> because<00:04:29.210> I<00:04:29.419> figured<00:04:29.780> I<00:04:29.900> was<00:04:29.990> going<00:04:30.080> to

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:30.169 
top because I figured I was going to

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:32.860 
top because I figured I was going to
spill<00:04:30.410> a<00:04:30.440> little<00:04:30.620> bit<00:04:31.120> but<00:04:32.120> uh<00:04:32.150> whenever<00:04:32.510> I<00:04:32.690> was

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
the pot was so filled up with water I

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.380 
the pot was so filled up with water I
accidentally<00:04:37.430> spilled<00:04:37.669> a<00:04:37.880> little<00:04:37.970> bit<00:04:38.120> and<00:04:38.300> it
