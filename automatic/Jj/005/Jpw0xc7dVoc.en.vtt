00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:49.310 
I left this site assembled so you could

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.280 
I left this site assembled so you could
see<00:00:49.580> you<00:00:50.420> know<00:00:50.510> what<00:00:50.660> I<00:00:50.690> was<00:00:50.870> talking<00:00:51.110> about

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:51.290 
see you know what I was talking about

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.890 
see you know what I was talking about
speaking<00:00:52.010> in<00:00:52.100> reference<00:00:52.280> of

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:53.900 
speaking in reference of

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.160 
speaking in reference of
the<00:00:54.470> pivot<00:00:54.890> point<00:00:54.920> right<00:00:55.400> here<00:00:55.430> this<00:00:55.730> you<00:00:55.910> see

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
the pivot point right here this you see

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.200 
the pivot point right here this you see
that<00:00:57.170> is<00:00:57.530> the<00:00:57.950> link<00:00:58.580> that<00:00:58.700> we're<00:00:58.940> going<00:00:59.060> to<00:00:59.120> be

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
that is the link that we're going to be

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.050 
that is the link that we're going to be
discussing

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:02.060 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.299 

this<00:01:02.630> site<00:01:02.900> is<00:01:02.930> disassembled<00:01:03.740> so<00:01:04.160> that<00:01:04.250> I

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
this site is disassembled so that I

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:05.950 
this site is disassembled so that I
could<00:01:04.370> make<00:01:04.670> it<00:01:04.700> easier<00:01:05.120> for<00:01:05.270> you<00:01:05.390> guys<00:01:05.450> to<00:01:05.750> see

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
could make it easier for you guys to see

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.670 
could make it easier for you guys to see
that's<00:01:06.710> the<00:01:06.890> link<00:01:07.100> hanging<00:01:07.490> off<00:01:07.610> right<00:01:07.790> here

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
that's the link hanging off right here

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.020 
that's the link hanging off right here
this<00:01:09.680> little<00:01:09.920> part<00:01:10.250> it's<00:01:10.490> up<00:01:10.640> in<00:01:10.790> the<00:01:10.820> air

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
this little part it's up in the air

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.210 
this little part it's up in the air
right<00:01:11.090> there<00:01:11.570> as<00:01:12.110> you<00:01:12.350> can<00:01:12.470> see<00:01:12.680> there's<00:01:12.950> three

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
right there as you can see there's three

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.230 
right there as you can see there's three
holes<00:01:13.430> on<00:01:14.500> the<00:01:15.500> interval<00:01:15.980> is<00:01:16.610> the<00:01:16.850> one<00:01:17.060> that's

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
holes on the interval is the one that's

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.710 
holes on the interval is the one that's
the<00:01:17.450> factory<00:01:17.930> setting<00:01:18.760> the<00:01:19.760> center<00:01:20.120> hole<00:01:20.330> is

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
the factory setting the center hole is

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.240 
the factory setting the center hole is
the<00:01:20.990> one<00:01:21.230> that<00:01:21.440> the<00:01:21.740> 3d<00:01:22.640> Tony<00:01:23.290> had<00:01:24.290> used<00:01:24.620> in<00:01:24.920> the

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
the one that the 3d Tony had used in the

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.760 
the one that the 3d Tony had used in the
review<00:01:25.640> video<00:01:26.060> of<00:01:26.450> the<00:01:26.660> madhok<00:01:27.110> three<00:01:27.410> honored

the<00:01:28.760> outer<00:01:28.970> all<00:01:29.270> I<00:01:29.300> found<00:01:29.720> to<00:01:29.990> my<00:01:30.020> knowledge<00:01:31.300> is

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.300 
the outer all I found to my knowledge is

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.050 
the outer all I found to my knowledge is
better<00:01:32.630> for<00:01:32.990> use<00:01:33.230> outside<00:01:33.470> in<00:01:34.130> breezy<00:01:34.850> or

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
better for use outside in breezy or

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.570 
better for use outside in breezy or
windy<00:01:35.119> conditions<00:01:35.869> what<00:01:36.770> these<00:01:36.950> things<00:01:36.979> do

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
windy conditions what these things do

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.180 
windy conditions what these things do
from<00:01:38.030> the<00:01:38.150> first<00:01:38.500> the<00:01:39.500> way<00:01:39.619> you<00:01:39.680> get<00:01:39.920> from<00:01:40.100> the

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
from the first the way you get from the

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.060 
from the first the way you get from the
factory<00:01:40.760> it<00:01:41.510> keeps<00:01:41.810> the<00:01:42.020> pitch<00:01:42.320> of<00:01:42.619> the<00:01:42.800> rotor

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
factory it keeps the pitch of the rotor

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.460 
factory it keeps the pitch of the rotor
very<00:01:43.700> minimal<00:01:44.180> movement<00:01:44.660> back<00:01:44.930> for<00:01:45.290> it<00:01:45.440> to

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
very minimal movement back for it to

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.620 
very minimal movement back for it to
break<00:01:45.740> left<00:01:46.100> when<00:01:47.060> you<00:01:47.150> move<00:01:47.300> it<00:01:47.420> to<00:01:47.540> the

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
break left when you move it to the

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.280 
break left when you move it to the
center<00:01:47.840> hall<00:01:48.170> it<00:01:48.920> gives<00:01:49.220> you<00:01:49.400> more<00:01:50.060> pitch<00:01:50.660> on

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
center hall it gives you more pitch on

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.290 
center hall it gives you more pitch on
the<00:01:51.590> rotor<00:01:51.800> and<00:01:52.580> when<00:01:52.760> you<00:01:52.850> move<00:01:53.000> it<00:01:53.119> to<00:01:53.210> the

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300 
the rotor and when you move it to the

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.270 
the rotor and when you move it to the
outside<00:01:53.330> wall<00:01:54.020> it<00:01:54.350> gives<00:01:54.619> it<00:01:54.800> an<00:01:54.860> extreme

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
outside wall it gives it an extreme

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.380 
outside wall it gives it an extreme
amount<00:01:55.640> of<00:01:55.850> pitch<00:01:56.330> for<00:01:56.720> the<00:01:56.780> rotor<00:01:57.190> so<00:01:58.390> the

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
amount of pitch for the rotor so the

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.070 
amount of pitch for the rotor so the
center<00:01:59.930> one<00:02:00.110> they<00:02:00.979> do<00:02:01.040> this<00:02:01.479> from<00:02:02.479> the<00:02:02.540> factory

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
center one they do this from the factory

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.540 
center one they do this from the factory
away<00:02:03.350> i'm<00:02:03.470> assuming<00:02:03.770> so<00:02:04.130> that<00:02:04.250> you<00:02:04.369> don't

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
away i'm assuming so that you don't

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:05.950 
away i'm assuming so that you don't
wreck<00:02:04.880> the<00:02:05.030> thing<00:02:05.270> when<00:02:05.450> you<00:02:05.540> pull<00:02:05.720> it<00:02:05.810> out<00:02:05.930> of

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
wreck the thing when you pull it out of

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.219 
wreck the thing when you pull it out of
locks<00:02:06.759> the<00:02:07.759> center<00:02:08.090> one<00:02:08.270> I<00:02:08.300> use<00:02:08.660> for<00:02:08.869> flying

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
locks the center one I use for flying
