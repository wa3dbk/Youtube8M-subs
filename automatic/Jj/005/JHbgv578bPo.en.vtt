these towers been working on for a

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:11.289 
these towers been working on for a
little<00:00:10.070> while<00:00:10.219> sort<00:00:10.639> of<00:00:10.700> waiting<00:00:10.909> for<00:00:11.030> parts

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:11.299 
little while sort of waiting for parts

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:12.939 
little while sort of waiting for parts
to<00:00:11.360> show<00:00:11.570> up<00:00:11.780> and<00:00:11.990> all<00:00:12.049> kinds<00:00:12.379> of<00:00:12.440> things<00:00:12.679> and

to show up and all kinds of things and
you<00:00:13.369> know<00:00:14.059> every<00:00:14.329> time<00:00:14.449> something<00:00:14.809> trickles

00:00:15.159 --> 00:00:15.169 
you know every time something trickles

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:16.420 
you know every time something trickles
in<00:00:15.320> I<00:00:15.469> can<00:00:15.650> work<00:00:15.799> on<00:00:15.919> them<00:00:16.070> a<00:00:16.100> little<00:00:16.279> bit<00:00:16.400> more

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:16.430 
in I can work on them a little bit more

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.700 
in I can work on them a little bit more
so<00:00:16.970> check<00:00:17.930> this<00:00:18.020> out<00:00:18.200> we<00:00:18.320> got<00:00:18.470> some<00:00:18.590> SMD<00:00:19.040> 18s

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:20.710 
so check this out we got some SMD 18s

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.870 
so check this out we got some SMD 18s
this<00:00:21.710> one's<00:00:21.920> going<00:00:22.130> in<00:00:22.220> the<00:00:22.310> Honda<00:00:22.520> that's<00:00:22.790> why

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:22.880 
this one's going in the Honda that's why

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:32.479 
this one's going in the Honda that's why
it's<00:00:23.030> got<00:00:23.120> a<00:00:23.180> different<00:00:23.480> color<00:00:23.600> basket<00:00:24.110> but

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.290 

yeah<00:00:34.340> 3,200<00:00:35.340> watts<00:00:35.489> going<00:00:35.760> on<00:00:35.850> each<00:00:35.969> one<00:00:36.180> of

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
yeah 3,200 watts going on each one of

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.970 
yeah 3,200 watts going on each one of
those<00:00:36.420> it'll<00:00:37.230> be<00:00:37.320> able<00:00:37.379> to<00:00:37.530> take<00:00:37.710> it<00:00:37.860> no

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
those it'll be able to take it no

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.850 
those it'll be able to take it no
problem<00:00:38.600> could<00:00:39.600> use<00:00:39.780> more<00:00:40.260> than<00:00:40.410> that<00:00:40.559> but

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
problem could use more than that but

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.610 
problem could use more than that but
that's<00:00:41.010> okay<00:00:41.340> it'll<00:00:42.030> be<00:00:42.149> in<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.239> big<00:00:42.420> old

so<00:03:50.650> it<00:03:50.740> all<00:03:50.830> do<00:03:50.980> now<00:03:51.130> is<00:03:51.420> drill<00:03:52.420> a<00:03:52.450> pilot<00:03:52.510> hole

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
so it all do now is drill a pilot hole

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.750 
so it all do now is drill a pilot hole
right<00:03:53.170> down<00:03:53.230> the<00:03:53.470> middle<00:03:53.680> of<00:03:54.330> that

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
right down the middle of that

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.339 
right down the middle of that
through<00:03:57.090> all<00:03:57.239> three<00:03:57.510> of<00:03:57.629> those<00:03:57.720> sheets<00:03:58.080> and

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:58.349 
through all three of those sheets and

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:00.259 
through all three of those sheets and
then<00:03:58.890> there's<00:03:59.129> no<00:03:59.310> way<00:03:59.519> that<00:03:59.760> the<00:03:59.909> circle

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
then there's no way that the circle

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.030 
then there's no way that the circle
can't<00:04:00.510> be<00:04:00.659> exactly<00:04:01.110> where<00:04:01.349> it<00:04:01.409> needs<00:04:01.590> to<00:04:01.680> be<00:04:01.799> on

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
can't be exactly where it needs to be on

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:34.320 
can't be exactly where it needs to be on
