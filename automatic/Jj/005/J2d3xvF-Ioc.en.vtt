00:00:05.949 --> 00:00:05.959 
frequently how we go about dividing

00:00:05.959 --> 00:00:08.490 
frequently how we go about dividing
hostas<00:00:06.439> the<00:00:06.799> questions<00:00:07.220> twofold<00:00:07.700> one<00:00:08.149> is

hostas the questions twofold one is
you're<00:00:09.500> buying<00:00:09.740> divisions<00:00:10.640> from<00:00:10.850> us<00:00:11.000> how<00:00:11.180> do

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:11.240 
you're buying divisions from us how do

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.850 
you're buying divisions from us how do
we<00:00:11.390> do<00:00:11.540> it<00:00:11.720> you<00:00:11.870> know<00:00:12.230> what<00:00:12.380> what<00:00:12.620> can<00:00:12.800> you

we do it you know what what can you

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.280 
we do it you know what what can you
expect<00:00:13.010> and<00:00:13.490> the<00:00:13.580> other<00:00:13.670> is<00:00:13.910> of<00:00:14.150> course<00:00:14.990> a<00:00:15.110> lot

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:15.290 
expect and the other is of course a lot

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:16.240 
expect and the other is of course a lot
of<00:00:15.320> you're<00:00:15.560> going<00:00:15.680> to<00:00:15.740> divide<00:00:16.010> your<00:00:16.129> own

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:16.250 
of you're going to divide your own

of you're going to divide your own
plants

I've<00:00:19.490> been<00:00:19.730> dividing<00:00:20.210> hostas<00:00:20.720> since<00:00:20.960> I<00:00:21.080> was<00:00:21.170> a

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:21.260 
I've been dividing hostas since I was a

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.570 
I've been dividing hostas since I was a
12<00:00:21.530> year<00:00:21.620> old<00:00:21.680> boy<00:00:22.510> that's<00:00:23.590> 40<00:00:24.590> years<00:00:24.920> and<00:00:25.280> you

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.580 
12 year old boy that's 40 years and you

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.720 
12 year old boy that's 40 years and you
don't<00:00:25.700> have<00:00:25.880> to<00:00:26.000> do<00:00:26.090> with<00:00:26.180> addition<00:00:27.730> but

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
don't have to do with addition but

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.580 
don't have to do with addition but
there's<00:00:28.940> definitely<00:00:29.150> some<00:00:29.660> ways<00:00:29.869> that<00:00:30.470> are

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.590 
there's definitely some ways that are

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.250 
there's definitely some ways that are
better<00:00:30.740> than<00:00:30.860> others<00:00:31.659> anyway<00:00:32.659> to<00:00:32.839> do<00:00:33.019> it<00:00:33.140> it's

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260 
better than others anyway to do it it's

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.869 
better than others anyway to do it it's
a<00:00:33.350> lot<00:00:33.499> of<00:00:33.559> work<00:00:34.149> you<00:00:35.149> are<00:00:35.179> going<00:00:35.359> to<00:00:35.839> set<00:00:36.170> the

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:36.879 
a lot of work you are going to set the

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:39.939 
a lot of work you are going to set the
plant<00:00:37.879> back<00:00:38.179> the<00:00:38.719> cutting<00:00:39.260> it<00:00:39.379> to<00:00:39.499> take<00:00:39.710> off

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:39.949 
plant back the cutting it to take off

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:41.799 
plant back the cutting it to take off
when<00:00:40.760> you<00:00:40.850> move<00:00:41.030> it<00:00:41.149> is<00:00:41.210> definitely<00:00:41.659> going<00:00:41.719> to

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
when you move it is definitely going to

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:45.790 
when you move it is definitely going to
be<00:00:41.870> stunted<00:00:42.260> the<00:00:42.350> following<00:00:42.769> year<00:00:44.499> but<00:00:45.499> it's

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
be stunted the following year but it's

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.000 
be stunted the following year but it's
certainly<00:00:46.190> a<00:00:46.280> way<00:00:46.429> of<00:00:46.639> of<00:00:47.179> giving<00:00:47.569> you<00:00:47.629> more

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 
certainly a way of of giving you more

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.219 
certainly a way of of giving you more
more<00:00:49.010> plants<00:00:49.489> in<00:00:50.149> your<00:00:50.239> garden<00:00:50.300> in<00:00:50.690> particular

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:51.229 
more plants in your garden in particular

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:53.500 
more plants in your garden in particular
before<00:00:51.440> you<00:00:51.530> start<00:00:51.769> dividing<00:00:51.979> plants<00:00:52.579> is<00:00:53.269> to

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
before you start dividing plants is to

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.479 
before you start dividing plants is to
sterilize<00:00:53.780> your<00:00:54.170> tools<00:00:54.440> it's<00:00:55.100> just<00:00:55.339> like<00:00:55.460> a

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
sterilize your tools it's just like a

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.180 
sterilize your tools it's just like a
doctor<00:00:55.819> washing<00:00:56.510> his<00:00:56.690> hands<00:00:57.199> before<00:00:57.499> an

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
doctor washing his hands before an

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.000

diseases that can be transferred you're

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.639 
diseases that can be transferred you're
playing<00:01:08.630> a<00:01:08.719> lot<00:01:08.840> of<00:01:08.990> are<00:01:09.079> transferred<00:01:09.530> by

kind<00:01:40.060> of<00:01:40.119> a<00:01:40.210> hybrid<00:01:40.359> pitchfork<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:42.549> it's

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
kind of a hybrid pitchfork and it's

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.209 
kind of a hybrid pitchfork and it's
pretty<00:01:43.569> strong<00:01:43.990> but<00:01:44.439> really<00:01:44.770> not<00:01:44.950> strong

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:45.219 
pretty strong but really not strong

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:49.080 
pretty strong but really not strong
enough<00:01:45.340> for<00:01:45.640> dividing<00:01:46.209> big<00:01:46.450> hostas<00:01:47.880> now<00:01:48.880> some

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
enough for dividing big hostas now some

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.209 
enough for dividing big hostas now some
of<00:01:49.149> these<00:01:49.240> houses<00:01:49.659> but<00:01:49.979> you're<00:01:50.979> gonna<00:01:51.100> be

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:51.219 
of these houses but you're gonna be

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:53.910 
of these houses but you're gonna be
surprised<00:01:51.579> but<00:01:51.819> they<00:01:52.450> can<00:01:52.600> weigh<00:01:52.719> 50<00:01:53.200> to<00:01:53.409> 100

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
surprised but they can weigh 50 to 100

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.760

to<00:01:54.009> 150<00:01:54.729> or<00:01:54.759> more<00:01:55.090> pounds<00:01:55.359> you<00:01:56.350> really<00:01:56.649> need

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
to 150 or more pounds you really need

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.270 
to 150 or more pounds you really need
some<00:01:56.950> strong<00:01:57.219> tools<00:01:57.549> we<00:01:57.759> break<00:01:58.030> shovels

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
some strong tools we break shovels

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.240 
some strong tools we break shovels
fairly<00:02:00.280> frequently

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
fairly frequently

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.190 
fairly frequently
you<00:02:02.910> don't<00:02:03.090> want<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.330> use<00:02:03.450> this<00:02:03.660> this<00:02:03.960> is<00:02:04.020> a

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
you don't want to use this this is a

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:10.460 
you don't want to use this this is a
kind<00:02:05.130> of<00:02:05.190> a<00:02:05.310> pitchfork<00:02:08.720> this<00:02:09.720> Gaiden<00:02:10.170> fork

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
kind of a pitchfork this Gaiden fork

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.110 
kind of a pitchfork this Gaiden fork
works<00:02:10.679> quite<00:02:11.009> well<00:02:11.039> advantage<00:02:11.640> of<00:02:11.730> using<00:02:11.850> this

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
works quite well advantage of using this

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.220 
works quite well advantage of using this
is<00:02:12.330> you're<00:02:12.450> not<00:02:12.600> going<00:02:12.810> to<00:02:12.870> break<00:02:12.990> so<00:02:13.200> many

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
is you're not going to break so many

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.790 
is you're not going to break so many
routes

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
routes

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:21.860 
routes
I<00:02:17.600> like<00:02:18.600> this<00:02:18.840> shovel<00:02:19.580> it's<00:02:20.870> pretty

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
I like this shovel it's pretty

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.480 
I like this shovel it's pretty
heavy-duty<00:02:22.170> although<00:02:22.650> it<00:02:22.770> broken<00:02:23.100> two<00:02:23.400> of

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
heavy-duty although it broken two of

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.580 
heavy-duty although it broken two of
them<00:02:23.580> here<00:02:23.790> this<00:02:23.910> year<00:02:24.170> it's<00:02:25.170> got<00:02:25.350> a<00:02:25.380> nice

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
them here this year it's got a nice

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.199 
them here this year it's got a nice
point<00:02:25.920> on<00:02:26.160> it<00:02:26.310> you<00:02:26.580> can<00:02:26.730> get<00:02:26.880> some<00:02:27.090> good

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
point on it you can get some good

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.310 
point on it you can get some good
leverage<00:02:28.550> the<00:02:29.550> disadvantage<00:02:30.180> of<00:02:30.270> shovels<00:02:31.230> of

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
leverage the disadvantage of shovels of

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.110 
leverage the disadvantage of shovels of
course<00:02:31.560> is<00:02:31.740> you're<00:02:31.920> going<00:02:32.010> to<00:02:32.100> be<00:02:32.190> you<00:02:32.850> can<00:02:33.090> be

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
course is you're going to be you can be

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.820 
course is you're going to be you can be
cutting<00:02:33.540> into<00:02:33.720> ruts<00:02:33.930> when<00:02:34.140> we<00:02:34.230> do<00:02:34.410> it<00:02:34.530> we<00:02:34.650> go

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
cutting into ruts when we do it we go

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.699 
cutting into ruts when we do it we go
way<00:02:35.190> back<00:02:35.489> from<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:35.880> base<00:02:36.840> of<00:02:37.020> the<00:02:37.080> plant<00:02:37.350> it's

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
way back from the base of the plant it's

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.750 
way back from the base of the plant it's
a<00:02:37.800> lot<00:02:37.980> of<00:02:38.100> work<00:02:39.980> this<00:02:40.980> type<00:02:41.190> of<00:02:41.220> shovel<00:02:41.640> is

short but again you can get around the

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:17.840 
short but again you can get around the
corner<00:03:11.360> yeah<00:03:14.330> for<00:03:15.330> knaves<00:03:16.130> we<00:03:17.130> try<00:03:17.370> not<00:03:17.520> to<00:03:17.640> cut

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
measure on the bottom but that's not a

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.720 
measure on the bottom but that's not a
reason<00:04:48.000> for<00:04:48.150> getting<00:04:48.540> it<00:04:48.630> and<00:04:49.590> if<00:04:50.070> you<00:04:50.430> put<00:04:50.640> it

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:50.730 
reason for getting it and if you put it

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:53.360 
reason for getting it and if you put it
in<00:04:50.820> the<00:04:50.880> ground<00:04:51.000> you<00:04:51.390> can<00:04:51.740> you<00:04:52.740> can<00:04:52.860> just<00:04:52.890> get<00:04:53.310> a

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
in the ground you can you can just get a

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.430 
in the ground you can you can just get a
lot<00:04:53.610> of<00:04:53.820> leverage<00:04:54.240> on<00:04:54.600> it<00:04:54.630> you<00:04:54.870> need<00:04:55.080> to<00:04:55.230> and
