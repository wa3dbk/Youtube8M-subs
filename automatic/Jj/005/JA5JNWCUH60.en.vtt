Dorado when it first came out because it
just<00:00:15.510> sort<00:00:15.870> of<00:00:15.960> looked<00:00:16.260> cheesy<00:00:16.800> and<00:00:17.400> in<00:00:17.580> some

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:17.790 
just sort of looked cheesy and in some

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.240 
just sort of looked cheesy and in some
ways<00:00:18.000> yeah<00:00:18.630> that's<00:00:18.990> kind<00:00:19.349> of<00:00:19.380> what<00:00:19.560> it<00:00:19.710> is<00:00:19.890> and

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
ways yeah that's kind of what it is and

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.130 
ways yeah that's kind of what it is and
in<00:00:20.400> other<00:00:20.580> ways<00:00:20.759> it's<00:00:21.090> actually<00:00:21.509> really<00:00:21.689> smart

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
in other ways it's actually really smart

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.380 
in other ways it's actually really smart
but<00:00:22.439> in<00:00:22.800> other<00:00:23.070> ways<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.640> animation<00:00:24.240> is<00:00:24.360> a

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
but in other ways the animation is a

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.060 
but in other ways the animation is a
little<00:00:24.689> lacking<00:00:25.080> but<00:00:25.230> in<00:00:25.380> other<00:00:25.529> ways<00:00:25.770> it's

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
little lacking but in other ways it's

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.070 
little lacking but in other ways it's
fantastic<00:00:26.760> in<00:00:27.000> other<00:00:27.240> ways<00:00:27.510> maybe<00:00:27.869> it<00:00:27.990> would

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
fantastic in other ways maybe it would

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.630 
fantastic in other ways maybe it would
have<00:00:28.140> been<00:00:28.289> fair<00:00:28.470> as<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.619> live-action<00:00:28.890> film<00:00:29.250> but

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
have been fair as a live-action film but

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.279 
have been fair as a live-action film but
in<00:00:29.850> other<00:00:30.000> ways<00:00:30.240> animation<00:00:30.810> is<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:30.990> perfect

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
in other ways animation is the perfect

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.950 
in other ways animation is the perfect

trying<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.070> get<00:01:23.159> across<00:01:23.460> an<00:01:23.670> action-adventure

trying to get across an action-adventure

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.390 
trying to get across an action-adventure
my<00:01:24.990> problem<00:01:25.380> with<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.590> film<00:01:25.830> I'm<00:01:26.100> really

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
my problem with the film I'm really

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.460 
my problem with the film I'm really
gonna<00:01:26.549> sound<00:01:26.880> weird<00:01:27.060> for<00:01:27.600> this<00:01:27.750> but<00:01:28.020> the

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
gonna sound weird for this but the

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.060 
gonna sound weird for this but the
animation<00:01:29.310> is<00:01:29.490> actually<00:01:29.790> too<00:01:30.659> good<00:01:30.930> what<00:01:31.860> do<00:01:32.009> I

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
animation is actually too good what do I

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.370 
animation is actually too good what do I
mean<00:01:32.220> by<00:01:32.280> that<00:01:32.580> well<00:01:33.150> Princess<00:01:33.900> Bride<00:01:34.049> was

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
mean by that well Princess Bride was

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.140 
mean by that well Princess Bride was
funny<00:01:34.619> because<00:01:34.830> it's<00:01:35.189> live-action<00:01:35.820> people

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
funny because it's live-action people

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.240 
funny because it's live-action people
acting<00:01:36.509> like<00:01:36.659> cartoon<00:01:37.110> characters<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:38.040> my

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
acting like cartoon characters and my

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.620 
acting like cartoon characters and my
theory<00:01:38.640> is<00:01:38.729> that<00:01:38.759> if<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.150> road<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.450> El<00:01:39.600> Dorado

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
theory is that if the road to El Dorado

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.200 
theory is that if the road to El Dorado
was<00:01:40.350> actually<00:01:40.979> live-action<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:41.820> would<00:01:42.119> have

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
was actually live-action it would have

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.940 
was actually live-action it would have
been<00:01:42.360> funnier<00:01:42.810> now<00:01:43.320> what<00:01:43.500> sense<00:01:43.740> does<00:01:43.890> that

been funnier now what sense does that

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.649 
been funnier now what sense does that

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
characters can that be ideal well the

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.740 
characters can that be ideal well the
animation<00:01:50.400> looks<00:01:50.610> very<00:01:50.820> similar<00:01:51.150> to<00:01:51.299> Prince

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
animation looks very similar to Prince

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.080 
animation looks very similar to Prince
of<00:01:51.899> Egypt<00:01:52.110> in<00:01:52.500> that<00:01:52.680> it's<00:01:52.979> very<00:01:53.340> pretty<00:01:53.820> and

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
of Egypt in that it's very pretty and

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.060 
of Egypt in that it's very pretty and
it's<00:01:54.210> very<00:01:54.420> nice-looking<00:01:54.750> but<00:01:55.619> that<00:01:55.740> doesn't

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
it's very nice-looking but that doesn't

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.700 
it's very nice-looking but that doesn't
always<00:01:56.250> translate<00:01:56.579> into<00:01:57.180> comedy<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:58.350> weakest

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
always translate into comedy the weakest

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.139 
always translate into comedy the weakest
part<00:01:58.890> of<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.130> Prince<00:01:59.340> of<00:01:59.460> Egypt<00:01:59.579> was<00:02:00.090> the

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
part of the Prince of Egypt was the

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.969 
part of the Prince of Egypt was the
comedy<00:02:00.780> but<00:02:01.229> that's<00:02:01.409> okay<00:02:01.680> it<00:02:01.799> wasn't

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
comedy but that's okay it wasn't

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.649 
comedy but that's okay it wasn't
essentially<00:02:02.490> meant<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.820> be<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:02.970> comedy<00:02:03.390> first

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
funny comedic animation this is where

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.710 
funny comedic animation this is where
you<00:02:11.220> need<00:02:11.670> Warner<00:02:12.390> Brothers<00:02:12.720> to<00:02:12.900> come<00:02:13.079> in<00:02:13.230> you

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
you need Warner Brothers to come in you

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.660 
you need Warner Brothers to come in you
the<00:02:13.960> fast<00:02:14.200> pace<00:02:14.530> you<00:02:14.740> need<00:02:15.010> the<00:02:15.190> over-the-top

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
the fast pace you need the over-the-top

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.300 
the fast pace you need the over-the-top
reactions<00:02:16.600> they<00:02:17.080> never<00:02:17.380> allow<00:02:17.800> them<00:02:18.010> to<00:02:18.160> get

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
reactions they never allow them to get

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.390 
reactions they never allow them to get
really<00:02:19.120> big<00:02:19.480> goofy<00:02:19.930> over-the-top<00:02:20.590> reactions

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
really big goofy over-the-top reactions

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.890 
really big goofy over-the-top reactions
I<00:02:21.670> think<00:02:22.090> they<00:02:22.180> were<00:02:22.240> more<00:02:22.480> concerned<00:02:22.810> about

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
I think they were more concerned about

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.690 
I think they were more concerned about
making<00:02:23.170> him<00:02:23.440> look<00:02:23.620> handsome<00:02:24.220> for<00:02:24.460> the<00:02:24.520> most

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
making him look handsome for the most

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.190 
making him look handsome for the most
part<00:02:24.910> is<00:02:25.060> pretty<00:02:25.240> restrained

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
part is pretty restrained

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.810 
part is pretty restrained
I<00:02:26.230> don't<00:02:26.590> know<00:02:26.680> that<00:02:26.860> totally<00:02:27.280> comes<00:02:27.490> down<00:02:27.670> to

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
I don't know that totally comes down to

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:28.980 
I don't know that totally comes down to
them<00:02:27.940> being<00:02:28.120> good-looking<00:02:28.390> though<00:02:28.810> because

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
them being good-looking though because

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:30.930 
them being good-looking though because
gels<00:02:29.560> pretty<00:02:29.860> good-looking<00:02:30.430> she<00:02:30.610> gets<00:02:30.820> some

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
gels pretty good-looking she gets some

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.850 
gels pretty good-looking she gets some
really<00:02:31.180> funny<00:02:31.360> reactions<00:02:31.990> but<00:02:32.470> I<00:02:32.530> think<00:02:32.770> in

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
really funny reactions but I think in

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.020 
really funny reactions but I think in
order<00:02:33.010> to<00:02:33.100> make<00:02:33.190> something<00:02:33.640> like<00:02:33.760> this<00:02:33.970> work

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
order to make something like this work

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.240 
order to make something like this work
you<00:02:34.450> need<00:02:34.480> the<00:02:34.990> team<00:02:35.260> from<00:02:35.530> say<00:02:35.800> the<00:02:36.040> Iron

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
you need the team from say the Iron

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.270 
you need the team from say the Iron
Giant<00:02:36.820> or<00:02:37.210> Hotel<00:02:37.600> Transylvania<00:02:37.830> the<00:02:38.830> people

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
Giant or Hotel Transylvania the people

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.950 
Giant or Hotel Transylvania the people
don't<00:02:39.490> move<00:02:39.610> realistically<00:02:40.450> enough<00:02:40.690> for<00:02:40.870> us

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:40.960 
don't move realistically enough for us

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.630 
don't move realistically enough for us
to<00:02:40.990> mistake<00:02:41.410> them<00:02:41.500> for<00:02:41.560> human<00:02:41.920> but<00:02:42.280> they<00:02:42.430> don't

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
to mistake them for human but they don't

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.460 
to mistake them for human but they don't
move<00:02:42.760> cartoony<00:02:43.600> enough<00:02:43.840> and<00:02:44.020> or<00:02:44.110> for<00:02:44.320> us<00:02:44.440> to

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
move cartoony enough and or for us to

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.920 
move cartoony enough and or for us to
laugh<00:02:44.620> at<00:02:45.040> them<00:02:45.190> but<00:02:45.550> with<00:02:45.910> that<00:02:46.090> said<00:02:46.150> I<00:02:46.480> don't

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
laugh at them but with that said I don't

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.720 
laugh at them but with that said I don't
think<00:02:47.170> it's<00:02:47.320> a<00:02:47.410> total<00:02:47.680> abject<00:02:48.040> failure<00:02:48.460> either

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
think it's a total abject failure either

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.910 
think it's a total abject failure either
like<00:02:49.330> I<00:02:49.420> said<00:02:49.600> it<00:02:49.780> is<00:02:49.810> written<00:02:50.260> very<00:02:50.440> well<00:02:50.680> and

like I said it is written very well and

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.350 
like I said it is written very well and
some<00:02:51.160> of<00:02:51.250> the<00:02:51.310> lines<00:02:51.520> do<00:02:51.790> get<00:02:51.970> a<00:02:52.000> good<00:02:52.150> layout

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
some of the lines do get a good layout

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:59.460 
some of the lines do get a good layout
can<00:02:52.960> you<00:02:53.200> or<00:02:53.350> not<00:02:53.700> god<00:02:57.480> you're<00:02:58.480> not<00:02:58.660> a<00:02:58.720> god<00:02:59.050> how

Lion King and I think I feel the same
way<00:03:40.959> about<00:03:41.110> this<00:03:41.680> as<00:03:41.950> I<00:03:42.070> do<00:03:42.130> about<00:03:42.519> the<00:03:42.670> life

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
way about this as I do about the life

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.280 
way about this as I do about the life
yeah<00:03:43.480> if<00:03:43.630> you<00:03:43.720> know<00:03:43.840> what<00:03:43.959> I<00:03:43.989> thought<00:03:44.140> about

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
yeah if you know what I thought about

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.710 
yeah if you know what I thought about
the<00:03:44.500> Lion<00:03:44.709> King<00:03:44.830> that's<00:03:45.250> not<00:03:45.489> that<00:03:45.790> great<00:03:46.209> but

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
the Lion King that's not that great but

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.360 
the Lion King that's not that great but
where<00:03:46.870> I<00:03:46.900> liked<00:03:47.230> at<00:03:47.350> least<00:03:47.560> two<00:03:47.830> songs<00:03:48.160> from

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
where I liked at least two songs from

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.250 
where I liked at least two songs from
Lion<00:03:48.640> King<00:03:48.910> I<00:03:49.030> can't<00:03:49.239> think<00:03:49.420> of<00:03:49.450> any<00:03:49.750> songs<00:03:50.080> I

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
Lion King I can't think of any songs I

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.750 
Lion King I can't think of any songs I
like<00:03:50.410> from<00:03:50.620> this<00:03:50.769> one<00:03:51.010> hell<00:03:51.250> I<00:03:51.280> barely<00:03:51.610> even

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
like from this one hell I barely even

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.580 
like from this one hell I barely even
remember<00:03:52.000> them<00:03:52.480> and<00:03:52.870> even<00:03:53.170> that<00:03:53.290> sort<00:03:53.560> of

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
remember them and even that sort of

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.620 
remember them and even that sort of
strange<00:03:53.920> because<00:03:54.130> the<00:03:54.400> heroes<00:03:54.760> sing<00:03:55.150> one<00:03:55.600> song

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
strange because the heroes sing one song

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.690 
strange because the heroes sing one song
it's<00:03:56.260> obviously<00:03:56.620> a<00:03:56.680> musical<00:03:57.130> number<00:03:57.280> but<00:03:57.580> then

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
it's obviously a musical number but then

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.460 
it's obviously a musical number but then
they<00:03:57.850> never<00:03:58.060> sing<00:03:58.420> any<00:03:58.630> of<00:03:58.780> the<00:03:58.900> others<00:03:59.230> it's

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
they never sing any of the others it's

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.830 
they never sing any of the others it's
just<00:03:59.830> Elton<00:04:00.220> John<00:04:00.550> singing<00:04:00.940> it<00:04:01.209> so<00:04:01.510> it's

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
just Elton John singing it so it's

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.140 
just Elton John singing it so it's
really<00:04:02.410> out<00:04:02.560> of<00:04:02.709> place<00:04:02.980> and<00:04:03.310> odd<00:04:03.550> though<00:04:04.120> I

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
really out of place and odd though I

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.000 
really out of place and odd though I
will<00:04:04.390> admit<00:04:04.630> it's<00:04:04.840> tough<00:04:05.050> to<00:04:05.200> be<00:04:05.320> a<00:04:05.350> God<00:04:05.650> will

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
will admit it's tough to be a God will

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.979 
will admit it's tough to be a God will
be<00:04:06.220> in<00:04:06.340> my<00:04:06.459> head<00:04:06.670> for<00:04:06.910> weeks<00:04:07.120> but<00:04:07.600> in<00:04:07.720> the<00:04:07.810> same

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
be in my head for weeks but in the same

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:10.229 
be in my head for weeks but in the same
way<00:04:08.050> Hakuna<00:04:08.560> Matata<00:04:08.920> will<00:04:09.130> be<00:04:09.280> in<00:04:09.519> yeah<00:04:10.030> you

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
way Hakuna Matata will be in yeah you

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:13.009 
way Hakuna Matata will be in yeah you
know<00:04:10.360> what<00:04:10.480> I<00:04:10.540> think<00:04:10.600> of<00:04:10.780> that

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:21.990 

but<00:04:14.019> if<00:04:14.200> you<00:04:14.500> get<00:04:14.920> the<00:04:15.340> people<00:04:19.289> that's<00:04:21.000> as

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
but if you get the people that's as

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.490 
but if you get the people that's as
opposed<00:04:22.240> to<00:04:22.330> many<00:04:22.509> respects<00:04:22.900> I<00:04:22.990> probably<00:04:23.229> am

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
opposed to many respects I probably am

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.260 
opposed to many respects I probably am
being<00:04:23.800> too<00:04:23.979> harsh<00:04:24.220> to<00:04:24.460> this<00:04:24.580> film<00:04:24.850> because

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
hard to make you laugh often if they

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.029 
hard to make you laugh often if they
really<00:04:36.789> wanted<00:04:37.360> that<00:04:37.389> to<00:04:37.780> work<00:04:38.050> they<00:04:38.440> really

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:39.039 
really wanted that to work they really

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:41.550 
really wanted that to work they really
needed<00:04:39.310> some<00:04:39.610> different<00:04:39.970> animation<00:04:40.539> but<00:04:41.080> it's

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
needed some different animation but it's

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.830 
needed some different animation but it's
a<00:04:41.800> beat<00:04:42.220> it's<00:04:42.550> well<00:04:42.789> written<00:04:43.150> they've<00:04:43.599> got

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
a beat it's well written they've got

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.540 
a beat it's well written they've got
some<00:04:44.080> good<00:04:44.229> stuff<00:04:44.530> I<00:04:44.860> think<00:04:45.220> you<00:04:45.280> could<00:04:45.430> even

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
some good stuff I think you could even

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.249 
some good stuff I think you could even
argue<00:04:45.729> there's<00:04:46.060> some<00:04:46.150> good<00:04:46.300> commentary<00:04:46.990> with

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:47.259 
argue there's some good commentary with

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:48.719 
argue there's some good commentary with
the<00:04:47.380> gods<00:04:47.650> trying<00:04:48.099> to<00:04:48.190> play<00:04:48.340> the<00:04:48.460> priests

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:48.729 
the gods trying to play the priests

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:50.370 
the gods trying to play the priests
against<00:04:49.120> each<00:04:49.270> other<00:04:49.509> and<00:04:49.720> how<00:04:49.840> religions

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
against each other and how religions

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.350 
against each other and how religions
work<00:04:50.710> and<00:04:51.039> I<00:04:51.280> think<00:04:51.970> there's<00:04:52.120> something<00:04:52.270> there

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
work and I think there's something there

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.120 
work and I think there's something there
maybe<00:04:53.080> in<00:04:53.259> the<00:04:53.349> end<00:04:53.470> that's<00:04:53.620> the<00:04:53.740> best<00:04:53.979> way<00:04:54.099> to

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130 
maybe in the end that's the best way to

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:54.810 
maybe in the end that's the best way to
describe<00:04:54.520> it

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
describe it

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.580 
describe it
there's<00:04:55.000> something<00:04:55.389> there<00:04:55.690> it's<00:04:56.080> just<00:04:56.410> not

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
there's something there it's just not

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.520 
there's something there it's just not
fully<00:04:56.830> realized<00:04:57.430> but<00:04:58.120> for<00:04:58.270> what<00:04:58.389> it<00:04:58.509> is<00:04:58.630> I'm

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
fully realized but for what it is I'm

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.379 
fully realized but for what it is I'm
glad<00:04:59.710> I<00:04:59.830> saw<00:05:00.099> it<00:05:00.130> I<00:05:00.460> don't<00:05:00.820> think<00:05:00.970> a<00:05:01.030> ton<00:05:01.210> of<00:05:01.240> my

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:01.389 
glad I saw it I don't think a ton of my
