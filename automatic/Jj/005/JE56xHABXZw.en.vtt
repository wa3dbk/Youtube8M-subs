roll up that's going to come to an end

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:59.750 
roll up that's going to come to an end
sometime<00:00:58.079> yeah<00:00:58.649> it<00:00:58.769> kind<00:00:58.949> of<00:00:59.010> has<00:00:59.159> to<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.640> you

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
sometime yeah it kind of has to the you

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.069 
sometime yeah it kind of has to the you
just<00:00:59.909> depends<00:01:00.329> on<00:01:00.390> how<00:01:00.510> you<00:01:00.570> handle<00:01:00.899> it<00:01:00.960> I

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
just depends on how you handle it I

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.259 
just depends on how you handle it I
guess<00:01:01.260> is<00:01:01.469> it's<00:01:02.100> how<00:01:02.309> you<00:01:02.729> know<00:01:02.850> you<00:01:02.909> don't

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269 
guess is it's how you know you don't

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:05.690 
guess is it's how you know you don't
want<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.479> let<00:01:04.019> it<00:01:04.170> affect<00:01:04.440> you<00:01:04.530> too<00:01:04.589> much<00:01:04.890> it<00:01:05.519> is

want to let it affect you too much it is

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.219 
want to let it affect you too much it is
really<00:01:05.940> hard<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.240> maintain<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.780> consistent

myself on the podium holding up the
trophy<00:01:52.990> last<00:01:53.290> year<00:01:53.620> and<00:01:53.860> so<00:01:54.040> it's<00:01:54.370> probably

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550 
trophy last year and so it's probably

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.700 
trophy last year and so it's probably
the<00:01:54.700> highlight<00:01:54.850> of<00:01:55.000> my<00:01:55.090> career<00:01:55.470> it's<00:01:56.470> as<00:01:56.560> good

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
the highlight of my career it's as good

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.170 
the highlight of my career it's as good
as<00:01:56.830> it<00:01:56.950> gets<00:01:57.040> to<00:01:57.580> win<00:01:57.700> an<00:01:57.790> event<00:01:57.880> like<00:01:58.120> that

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
as it gets to win an event like that

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.150 
as it gets to win an event like that
obviously<00:01:59.140> the<00:01:59.229> world<00:01:59.410> titles<00:01:59.770> what
