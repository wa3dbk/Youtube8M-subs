00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
minutes I have to say also it's just a

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.490 
minutes I have to say also it's just a
little<00:03:18.310> detail<00:03:18.640> it's<00:03:19.120> not<00:03:19.330> really<00:03:20.020> important

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
little detail it's not really important

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.220 
little detail it's not really important
but<00:03:20.560> it<00:03:21.220> might<00:03:21.460> count<00:03:21.790> also<00:03:22.030> when<00:03:22.750> I<00:03:22.780> bake<00:03:23.050> the

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
just a detail I think it will still feel

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.180 
just a detail I think it will still feel
right<00:03:30.120> if<00:03:31.120> somebody<00:03:31.570> is<00:03:31.720> trying<00:03:31.890> with<00:03:32.890> such

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.300 
always did it without socks it could
make<00:03:40.959> a<00:03:40.989> difference<00:03:42.600> so<00:03:43.600> like<00:03:43.930> this<00:03:44.170> and<00:03:44.470> so

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
make a difference so like this and so

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.270 
make a difference so like this and so
many<00:03:45.489> time<00:03:45.850> you<00:03:46.030> spend<00:03:46.300> it<00:03:46.420> in<00:03:46.570> the<00:03:46.780> oven<00:03:47.250> yeah

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
many time you spend it in the oven yeah

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.270 
many time you spend it in the oven yeah
now<00:03:48.790> the<00:03:48.850> important<00:03:49.690> thing<00:03:49.720> is<00:03:50.050> we<00:03:50.739> put<00:03:50.950> it<00:03:51.070> in

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
now the important thing is we put it in

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
now the important thing is we put it in
the<00:03:51.489> oven<00:03:51.820> already<00:03:52.239> and<00:03:53.050> we<00:03:53.380> let<00:03:53.560> it<00:03:53.940> we<00:03:54.940> let<00:03:55.090> it

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:55.300 
the oven already and we let it we let it

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.780 
the oven already and we let it we let it
stand<00:03:55.780> here<00:03:56.110> for<00:03:56.430> 45<00:03:57.430> minutes<00:03:58.560> but<00:03:59.560> no<00:03:59.860> heat<00:04:00.160> so

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
stand here for 45 minutes but no heat so

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.400 
stand here for 45 minutes but no heat so
after<00:04:01.270> 45<00:04:01.780> minutes<00:04:02.340> we<00:04:03.340> crank<00:04:03.670> it<00:04:03.790> up<00:04:03.940> to<00:04:04.420> 400

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
after 45 minutes we crank it up to 400

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.670 
after 45 minutes we crank it up to 400
Fahrenheit<00:04:05.800> or<00:04:06.370> higher<00:04:07.330> degrees<00:04:07.840> partly<00:04:08.050> and

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
Fahrenheit or higher degrees partly and

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.410 
Fahrenheit or higher degrees partly and
then<00:04:09.430> we<00:04:09.959> have<00:04:10.959> one<00:04:11.320> hour<00:04:11.500> how<00:04:12.340> many<00:04:12.640> degrees

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
then we have one hour how many degrees

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.250 
then we have one hour how many degrees
in<00:04:13.930> Celsius<00:04:14.350> I<00:04:14.890> think<00:04:15.790> it's<00:04:16.030> about<00:04:16.510> 225

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
in Celsius I think it's about 225

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.670 
in Celsius I think it's about 225
possibly<00:04:18.010> death<00:04:18.220> yeah<00:04:18.730> okay<00:04:19.600> thank<00:04:20.500> you<00:04:20.560> very
