00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 in a world in which the existence of 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:05.160
 God is a fact both heaven and 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.540
 the hell are oversaturated and not 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.090
 is missing a lot so that in the human world 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.490
 the same thing happens and after leaving words of 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.019
 motivating gods leave the world and the 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.450
 people stop dying 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.070
 for this God grants a last miracle 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.109
 and send the guardians of tombs that 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.240
 will play the role of burying the 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.920
 undead for this series 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.150
 become a manifestation of the 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.949
 organic deliriums full of violence 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.949
 disgustingly environment 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.140
 and you will have putrefaction where the 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:37.280
 screen guts cartilages and zombies 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:39.140
 of the senses are carried out by 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.489
 these guardians of tombs this 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.559
 means that if a normal person 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:44.570
 wants to bury the dead would not have 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.000
 the same defect since it would be like 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.530
 hide dust under a rug 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.449
 this is going to make these dig grave 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.040
 appear and properly carry the 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:55.660
 ceremony to bury the dead for 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.660
 that they obtain eternal rest 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.160
 in the casting of people that we are going to 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:01.960
 see a personality and visitors like 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.150
 there is the tender and sweet loly whose voice 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.890
 It brings back very bad memories and has a 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.050
 design very similar to the disagreement of kino 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.850
 motorbike not only has the same color 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.800
 of eyes and hair but also has a 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.050
 similar hairstyle and comes from the same 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.180
 study on the other hand we have a 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.130
 albino who is in search of a woman 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.560
 human isaac whose bag makes in my six 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.259
 favorites guess who the fuji 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.630
 body like jean todt wiiware cakes 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:27.580
 Sep as I said was casey that to find 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.619
 several old acquaintances in a series in 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.850
 the one that want to kill an albino played me 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:32.850
 various tricks of the mind 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.970
 yes 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.460
 cherche run this life 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.049
 I'm sure the series is going to 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.850
 route to an adventure so that the 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.530
 from there go to auto 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.899
 discovering herself as a guardian of 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.310
 tombs in addition to finding the whereabouts of 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.259
 his father next to an albino who is 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:57.390
 looking for a woman and whose motives 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:59.219
 We still do not know, I think it's too much 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.780
 say that after revealing that outside of 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.880
 town is full of that fairing by 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.189
 part of an innumerable amount of 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.350
 zombies that's going to bring the drama a bit 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:10.270
 of action some moral dilemmas and 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.400
 many sufferings 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.530
 the colorful set of abundant orange 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.420
 in a sunset present in almost all the 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.910
 chapter gave him that tone and this atmosphere 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.290
 desolate to that open environment and 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.000
 little inhabited that knew how to reflect 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.290
 too well the feeling of 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.020
 abandonment by a little god 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.720
 competent although I have some small 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.610
 complaint and that they abused Maceo with the 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.080
 saturated colors orange in all 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.760
 moments because I felt that when 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.620
 they went to the colors of shades 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.200
 dark blue life is me 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.760
 It comforted a lot, it's not that it's 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.890
 particularly bad but it would be good 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.650
 that they did not resort too much to that trick 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.390
 so many times although I personally personally 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.840
 I tend to get carried away too much by 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.840
 saturated colors 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.380
 as regards soundtrack is not 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.330
 something for which I have to remove the 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.590
 hat but I complement pretty well 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.170
 with all the events in a way 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.000
 Soft and proper is more if there is something 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.670
 remarkable what you have to talk about in 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.530
 what music is the lenin that 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.480
 They were nailed as Cliffhanger at the close 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.760
 of each chapter and there is a curiosity 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.590
 within all this and that is that it has 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.320
 certain similarity with the music of 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.180
 trailer of the game of the dead island I'm going 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.800
 to leave the link as to make a 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.050
 comparative and realize it more or 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.270
 less than what I'm talking about 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:25.850
 of the opening is not that it was world but not 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.560
 addition or subtraction the thing is more is there 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.360
 for whoever wants to see it complete or 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.720
 skip what was particularly my 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.720
 case 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.520
 one last little thing I hope the director 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.950
 do not go route the series of stories 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.600
 autoconclusivas full of drama and with 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.239
 characters that soon after 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.130
 presenting it to them is going to kill is not that 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:48.250
 say that it is not going to happen but I hope that 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.959
 do not devote the whole series 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.120
 conclusions this is not a series of the 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.680
 that you have too much expectation but 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.239
 yes enough to have the 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.820
 little curiosity to want to continue 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:01.730
 watching a little more at least as to 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.140
 kill a little bit of time so people there are not 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.000
 more nothing to say 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.070
 I hope you liked the video and 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.830
 if it was like that, light favorites comment 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:12.590
 subscribe to be all that you 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:15.549
 want so we see people until the 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.549
 next video 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.860
 before closing the video I want to say 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.480
 two little things the first thing is the curious thing about 

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:25.760
 the series because they broadcast it one day 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.740
 Sunday in Japan and the second thing is that 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.680
 this video I uploaded one Sunday day 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:34.600
 also what irony thing does not 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.600
 wang I leave you these guys
