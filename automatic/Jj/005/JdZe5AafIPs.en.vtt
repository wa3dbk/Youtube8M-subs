again<00:01:55.290> you<00:01:55.530> want<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.710> duplicate<00:01:55.890> it<00:01:56.189> there's<00:01:56.460> a

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
again you want to duplicate it there's a

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.190 
again you want to duplicate it there's a
lot<00:01:56.579> duplicating<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.659> want<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:57.960> choose

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
lot duplicating and you want to choose

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.260 
lot duplicating and you want to choose
it<00:01:58.350> again<00:01:58.439> as<00:01:59.430> that<00:01:59.820> color

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
it again as that color

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.139 
it again as that color
and<00:02:01.570> one<00:02:01.719> weekend<00:02:02.020> little<00:02:02.380> bit<00:02:02.500> smaller<00:02:03.149> and

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
and one weekend little bit smaller and

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:07.529 
and one weekend little bit smaller and
that's<00:02:04.329> going<00:02:04.479> to<00:02:04.539> be<00:02:04.630> the<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:06.460> wheel<00:02:06.880> of<00:02:07.119> the

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:07.539 
that's going to be the the wheel of the

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:10.139 
that's going to be the the wheel of the
wheelchair<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:09.220> the<00:02:09.310> next<00:02:09.429> thing<00:02:09.640> you<00:02:09.970> want

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
wheelchair and the next thing you want

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.940 
wheelchair and the next thing you want
to<00:02:10.450> choose<00:02:10.810> is<00:02:11.170> actually<00:02:11.980> a<00:02:13.349> like<00:02:14.349> a<00:02:14.379> triangle

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
to choose is actually a like a triangle

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.930 
to choose is actually a like a triangle
sort<00:02:15.670> of<00:02:15.959> diamond<00:02:16.959> yell<00:02:17.170> at<00:02:17.260> so<00:02:17.410> on<00:02:17.530> and<00:02:17.940> you

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
sort of diamond yell at so on and you

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.850 
sort of diamond yell at so on and you
want<00:02:19.180> to<00:02:19.390> make<00:02:19.569> it<00:02:21.299> this<00:02:22.299> color<00:02:22.860> the

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
want to make it this color the

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.619 
want to make it this color the
background<00:02:24.400> color<00:02:24.760> things<00:02:25.090> background<00:02:25.480> color

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:25.629 
background color things background color

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:29.699 
background color things background color
as<00:02:26.080> you<00:02:26.200> can<00:02:26.319> see<00:02:26.560> we<00:02:26.950> make<00:02:27.160> a<00:02:27.489> arc<00:02:28.709> almost

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
as you can see we make a arc almost

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.199 
as you can see we make a arc almost
almost<00:02:30.510> semicircle<00:02:31.510> in<00:02:32.140> the<00:02:32.290> wheelchair<00:02:33.209> so

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
almost semicircle in the wheelchair so

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.479 
almost semicircle in the wheelchair so
next<00:02:34.660> we<00:02:35.140> are<00:02:35.170> going<00:02:35.319> to<00:02:35.650> make<00:02:35.769> the<00:02:36.010> body<00:02:36.310> of

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
next we are going to make the body of

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.809 
next we are going to make the body of
the<00:02:36.670> person<00:02:36.930> which<00:02:37.930> is<00:02:38.319> going<00:02:38.739> we're<00:02:39.640> going<00:02:39.670> to

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
the person which is going we're going to

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:45.390 
the person which is going we're going to
be<00:02:39.970> selecting<00:02:40.810> a<00:02:42.569> rectangle<00:02:43.650> medium<00:02:44.650> I<00:02:44.860> think

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
be selecting a rectangle medium I think

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.160 
be selecting a rectangle medium I think
that's<00:02:45.549> how<00:02:45.700> you<00:02:45.730> pronounce<00:02:45.849> it<00:02:46.239> I'm<00:02:46.780> going<00:02:47.079> to

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
that's how you pronounce it I'm going to

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.809 
that's how you pronounce it I'm going to
just<00:02:47.260> make<00:02:47.410> a<00:02:47.440> little<00:02:47.709> smaller<00:02:48.040> and<00:02:48.280> I'll<00:02:48.700> to

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
just make a little smaller and I'll to

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:50.610 
just make a little smaller and I'll to
make<00:02:48.970> it<00:02:49.120> longer<00:02:49.329> we're<00:02:49.690> going<00:02:49.840> to<00:02:49.930> press<00:02:50.349> our

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
make it longer we're going to press our

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.880 
make it longer we're going to press our
s<00:02:51.630> which<00:02:52.630> is<00:02:52.660> free<00:02:52.989> scaling<00:02:53.470> and<00:02:53.620> we're<00:02:53.769> just

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
s which is free scaling and we're just

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.199 
s which is free scaling and we're just
going<00:02:54.010> to<00:02:54.040> make<00:02:54.190> it<00:02:54.340> a<00:02:54.400> bit<00:02:54.519> wider<00:02:54.730> and<00:02:55.000> a<00:02:55.060> bit

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
going to make it a bit wider and a bit

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:03.150 
going to make it a bit wider and a bit
thinner<00:02:57.660> like<00:02:58.660> so<00:03:00.120> and<00:03:01.120> then<00:03:01.950> I'm<00:03:02.950> just<00:03:03.010> going

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
thinner like so and then I'm just going

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.520 
thinner like so and then I'm just going
to<00:03:03.220> make<00:03:03.340> it<00:03:03.430> a<00:03:03.489> bit<00:03:03.610> bigger<00:03:03.790> again<00:03:04.410> but<00:03:05.410> make

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
to make it a bit bigger again but make

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:06.720 
to make it a bit bigger again but make
sure<00:03:05.560> you<00:03:05.859> have<00:03:05.980> enough<00:03:06.160> room<00:03:06.340> to<00:03:06.489> fit<00:03:06.519> the

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
sure you have enough room to fit the

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.569 
sure you have enough room to fit the
head<00:03:06.940> in<00:03:07.060> as<00:03:07.180> well<00:03:07.470> so<00:03:08.470> we're<00:03:09.160> just<00:03:09.310> making<00:03:09.430> a

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579 
head in as well so we're just making a

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:14.190 
head in as well so we're just making a
little<00:03:09.910> bit<00:03:10.090> smaller<00:03:11.400> like<00:03:12.630> so<00:03:13.630> that<00:03:13.930> should

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
little bit smaller like so that should

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.720 
little bit smaller like so that should
do<00:03:14.380> and<00:03:14.970> now<00:03:15.970> we<00:03:16.030> want<00:03:16.480> to<00:03:16.630> get<00:03:16.810> I<00:03:16.840> think<00:03:17.730> we

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
do and now we want to get I think we

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.360 
do and now we want to get I think we
want<00:03:18.940> to<00:03:19.030> duplicate<00:03:19.299> that<00:03:20.100> so<00:03:21.100> I<00:03:21.130> should<00:03:21.280> go

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
want to duplicate that so I should go

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.629 
want to duplicate that so I should go
throwing<00:03:21.549> out<00:03:21.730> a<00:03:21.760> duplicate<00:03:22.209> and<00:03:23.459> you<00:03:24.459> want<00:03:24.609> a

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:24.639 
throwing out a duplicate and you want a

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:28.520 
throwing out a duplicate and you want a
free<00:03:24.760> scale<00:03:25.090> it<00:03:25.209> again<00:03:25.420> and<00:03:25.859> make<00:03:26.859> it<00:03:27.160> wider

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
free scale it again and make it wider

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.990 
free scale it again and make it wider
that's<00:03:29.530> not<00:03:29.650> wider<00:03:29.829> that's<00:03:30.579> right<00:03:30.730> it's<00:03:30.940> the

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
that's not wider that's right it's the

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.259 
that's not wider that's right it's the
same<00:03:31.299> but<00:03:32.019> make<00:03:32.170> it<00:03:32.200> a<00:03:32.410> little<00:03:32.620> bit<00:03:32.829> smaller

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
same but make it a little bit smaller

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.460 
same but make it a little bit smaller
about<00:03:34.269> that<00:03:34.660> log<00:03:34.840> there's<00:03:35.079> going<00:03:35.200> to<00:03:35.260> be<00:03:35.290> the

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
about that log there's going to be the

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.759 
about that log there's going to be the
leg<00:03:35.799> of<00:03:36.040> the<00:03:36.280> guy<00:03:36.480> so<00:03:37.480> let's<00:03:38.319> just<00:03:38.560> pop<00:03:38.739> that

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
leg of the guy so let's just pop that

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:42.449 
leg of the guy so let's just pop that
down<00:03:38.920> there<00:03:39.480> and<00:03:40.480> make<00:03:40.690> it<00:03:40.900> straighter<00:03:41.799> there

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
down there and make it straighter there

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.970 
down there and make it straighter there
we<00:03:42.549> go<00:03:43.200> okay<00:03:44.200> now<00:03:44.440> I<00:03:44.470> want<00:03:44.500> it<00:03:44.709> straight<00:03:44.829> as

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
we go okay now I want it straight as

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.970 
we go okay now I want it straight as
possible

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
possible

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:53.220 
possible
like<00:03:47.980> so<00:03:49.620> that<00:03:50.620> looks<00:03:50.770> bit<00:03:50.950> weird<00:03:52.110> okay<00:03:53.110> that

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
like so that looks bit weird okay that

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.070 
like so that looks bit weird okay that
should<00:03:53.260> do<00:03:53.530> and<00:03:53.770> I<00:03:53.890> you<00:03:54.220> get<00:03:54.610> the<00:03:54.730> idea<00:03:55.080> you

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 
should do and I you get the idea you

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.040 
should do and I you get the idea you
want<00:03:56.200> to<00:03:56.260> duplicate<00:03:56.380> that<00:03:56.620> once<00:03:56.980> again<00:03:57.310> and

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050 
want to duplicate that once again and

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:02.310 
want to duplicate that once again and
put<00:03:59.050> it<00:03:59.140> as<00:03:59.290> the<00:03:59.530> leg<00:03:59.800> looking<00:04:00.190> down<00:04:00.400> I<00:04:01.230> tend<00:04:02.230> to

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
put it as the leg looking down I tend to

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.920 
put it as the leg looking down I tend to
keep<00:04:02.440> this<00:04:02.590> the<00:04:02.770> same<00:04:03.100> now<00:04:04.000> what<00:04:04.150> we<00:04:04.240> may<00:04:04.390> do<00:04:04.450> is

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
keep this the same now what we may do is

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:10.400 
keep this the same now what we may do is
actually<00:04:05.290> make<00:04:05.530> this<00:04:05.830> a<00:04:05.890> bit<00:04:06.100> smaller<00:04:06.990> because

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:15.900 

so<00:04:11.410> big<00:04:11.650> looks<00:04:12.190> fit<00:04:12.400> there<00:04:13.260> there<00:04:14.260> you<00:04:14.740> go<00:04:14.920> and

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
so big looks fit there there you go and

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:17.870

twenty<00:05:56.610> percent<00:05:57.000> maybe<00:05:57.270> yeah<00:05:57.930> looks<00:05:58.110> good<00:05:59.960> so

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 
twenty percent maybe yeah looks good so

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.130 
twenty percent maybe yeah looks good so
let's<00:06:01.140> make<00:06:01.380> a<00:06:01.440> bit<00:06:01.920> down<00:06:02.700> and<00:06:03.180> there<00:06:03.780> we<00:06:03.960> go
