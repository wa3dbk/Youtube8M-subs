so<00:04:57.669> I'll<00:04:57.760> pull<00:04:57.970> the<00:04:58.060> sample<00:04:58.389> from<00:04:58.479> this<00:04:58.630> one

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
so I'll pull the sample from this one

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:59.879 
so I'll pull the sample from this one
since<00:04:59.050> it<00:04:59.169> started<00:04:59.350> to<00:04:59.440> get<00:04:59.500> back<00:04:59.650> there<00:04:59.830> and

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
then we'll go around pull the sample

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.270 
then we'll go around pull the sample
fits<00:05:01.900> you<00:05:01.990> put<00:05:02.139> this<00:05:02.229> on<00:05:02.410> here<00:05:02.620> oh<00:05:02.830> no<00:05:03.160> we're

we'll<00:05:20.199> pull<00:05:20.349> a<00:05:20.410> clean<00:05:20.650> sample<00:05:20.860> that<00:05:21.070> doesn't

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 
we'll pull a clean sample that doesn't

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:28.980 
we'll pull a clean sample that doesn't
have<00:05:21.370> alcohol<00:05:21.760> in<00:05:21.789> it<00:05:21.940> I<00:05:22.150> understand

this<00:06:43.309> is<00:06:43.459> tank<00:06:43.699> seven<00:06:44.379> it's<00:06:45.379> going<00:06:45.529> to<00:06:45.619> be<00:06:45.709> kind

00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:45.919 
this is tank seven it's going to be kind

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:47.199 
this is tank seven it's going to be kind
of<00:06:46.069> hazy<00:06:46.249> because<00:06:46.579> we<00:06:46.669> haven't<00:06:46.879> filtered<00:06:47.029> it

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:47.209 
of hazy because we haven't filtered it

00:06:47.209 --> 00:06:48.789 
of hazy because we haven't filtered it

00:07:01.119 --> 00:07:01.129 
those plates as they're flowing out of

00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:02.889 
those plates as they're flowing out of
suspension<00:07:01.669> I'm<00:07:02.179> going<00:07:02.359> to<00:07:02.449> pushes<00:07:02.749> those

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:02.899
