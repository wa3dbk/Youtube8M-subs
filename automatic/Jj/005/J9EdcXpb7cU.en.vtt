just<00:04:21.049> decay<00:04:22.099> on<00:04:23.099> the<00:04:23.219> back<00:04:23.370> here<00:04:23.639> we<00:04:23.880> have<00:04:23.909> a<00:04:24.120> Z

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
just decay on the back here we have a Z

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.180 
just decay on the back here we have a Z
peih-gee<00:04:24.930> i<00:04:24.960> guess<00:04:25.380> is<00:04:25.560> that<00:04:25.590> what<00:04:25.890> that<00:04:25.920> is

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
peih-gee i guess is that what that is

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.760 
peih-gee i guess is that what that is
and<00:04:26.700> that<00:04:26.760> shoots<00:04:27.120> the<00:04:27.240> extremely<00:04:28.020> powerful

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
and that shoots the extremely powerful

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.760 
and that shoots the extremely powerful
projectile<00:04:29.460> or<00:04:29.790> mainly<00:04:30.390> used<00:04:30.600> for<00:04:30.900> his<00:04:31.110> rocket

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
projectile or mainly used for his rocket

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.550 
projectile or mainly used for his rocket
jump<00:04:32.070> boom<00:04:32.750> so<00:04:33.750> that's<00:04:33.930> kind<00:04:34.140> of<00:04:34.170> neat<00:04:34.350> on<00:04:34.470> the

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
jump boom so that's kind of neat on the

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.070 
jump boom so that's kind of neat on the
back<00:04:34.680> end<00:04:34.890> it<00:04:35.010> detaches<00:04:35.420> leaving<00:04:36.420> a<00:04:36.480> huge<00:04:36.810> hole

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
back end it detaches leaving a huge hole

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.010 
back end it detaches leaving a huge hole
in<00:04:37.110> this<00:04:37.380> back<00:04:37.560> by<00:04:37.770> the<00:04:37.830> way<00:04:38.040> but<00:04:39.000> nothing<00:04:39.780> too

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
in this back by the way but nothing too

in this back by the way but nothing too
bad<00:04:40.290> and<00:04:40.560> probably<00:04:40.920> rotating<00:04:41.370> head<00:04:41.550> 360

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
bad and probably rotating head 360

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:08.670 
break that looks just it's just kind of

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:10.340
