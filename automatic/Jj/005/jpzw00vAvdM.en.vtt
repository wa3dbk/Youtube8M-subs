00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
wouldn't switch channels you know it's

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.000 
wouldn't switch channels you know it's
easier<00:00:54.750> when<00:00:54.840> it's<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:55.079> smaller<00:00:55.410> map<00:00:55.710> like

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
easier when it's a smaller map like

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.619 
easier when it's a smaller map like
sleep<00:00:56.280> you<00:00:56.399> would<00:00:56.579> it's<00:00:56.820> really<00:00:57.149> small<00:00:57.360> so<00:00:57.420> you

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
sleep you would it's really small so you

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.420 
sleep you would it's really small so you
know<00:00:57.780> right<00:00:58.050> away<00:00:58.170> if<00:00:58.469> there's<00:00:58.680> one<00:00:58.859> in<00:00:59.219> there

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
know right away if there's one in there

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.849 
know right away if there's one in there
or<00:00:59.699> someone<00:01:00.030> already<00:01:00.090> killed<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:00.649> so<00:01:01.649> i<00:01:01.680> would

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
or someone already killed it so i would

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.830 
or someone already killed it so i would
suggest<00:01:01.949> go<00:01:02.219> into<00:01:02.370> smaller<00:01:02.609> maps<00:01:02.910> rather<00:01:03.660> than

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
suggest go into smaller maps rather than

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.859 
suggest go into smaller maps rather than
like<00:01:04.019> huge<00:01:04.350> maps<00:01:04.589> like<00:01:05.070> Orbis<00:01:05.519> for<00:01:05.760> example<00:01:06.240> so

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
like huge maps like Orbis for example so

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.719 
like huge maps like Orbis for example so
all<00:01:07.560> you<00:01:07.710> have<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.890> do<00:01:08.010> is<00:01:08.100> just<00:01:08.130> kill<00:01:08.520> and

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
all you have to do is just kill and

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.870 
all you have to do is just kill and
collect<00:01:09.030> 30<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.540> items<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:09.990> drops<00:01:10.260> and

collect 30 of the items it drops and

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.160 
collect 30 of the items it drops and
you're<00:01:11.880> done<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.330> get<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.570> middle<00:01:12.840> so<00:01:12.990> why

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
you're done you get the middle so why

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.020
