00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:07.430
 it was my little three coat at 

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:10.009
 dojo y this time it's going to be at 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.019
 members of the chimeras through their 

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:14.469
 purchases 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:17.000
 so what is chain fishing 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:22.429
 it's a technique is haunted by a 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:26.419
 soldier who allows kimon more 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:29.839
 easily in exchange and for that he 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:35.720
 do not have to position yourself between three 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:39.950
 years at home there for the three voices 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:42.440
 rude monks boxet what abilities 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:45.110
 special called saints sale 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.070
 these little white advisers who 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.070
 wanted to be a good choice 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:54.380
 This technique works because you eat 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:01:01.630
 tried and it allowed me to have a like 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:01:01.630
 during a grand canal that facts 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:36.600
 see so you see here this is the 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:36.600
 pokemon shooting then he 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.150
 and you are positioned any time there 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.960
 see 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.480
 as clearly hard so we'll get 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.480
 to put 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.750
 Yes 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.750

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:26.120
 yes really the four hour work 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:28.970
 in china is very lucky it takes 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.280
 absolutely leaking beat called ni 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.760
 captured even you did not want in your 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:38.230
 pokedex it does not matter but it is 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.230

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:56.239
 can which then breaks 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:03:00.849
 some packages simply shake 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.849
 place but a small centimeter 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:13.280

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:17.630
 to ratify too quickly you see that 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:22.930

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.930
 pause and I snore a bit for the 10th 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:30.530
