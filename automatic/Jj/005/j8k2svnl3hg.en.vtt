one<00:02:31.110> thing<00:02:31.290> I<00:02:31.380> noticed<00:02:31.590> was<00:02:32.099> that<00:02:35.390> these<00:02:36.390> two

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
one thing I noticed was that these two

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.380 
one thing I noticed was that these two
wheels<00:02:37.380> seem<00:02:37.769> to<00:02:37.980> not<00:02:38.160> maybe<00:02:38.730> roll<00:02:39.120> all<00:02:39.360> the

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
wheels seem to not maybe roll all the

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.720 
wheels seem to not maybe roll all the
time<00:02:39.720> so<00:02:39.930> I<00:02:39.989> don't<00:02:40.140> know<00:02:40.260> if<00:02:40.410> this<00:02:41.069> is<00:02:41.130> twisted

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
time so I don't know if this is twisted

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.490 
time so I don't know if this is twisted
a<00:02:41.790> little<00:02:41.819> bit<00:02:42.180> it<00:02:42.810> looks<00:02:43.019> pretty<00:02:43.170> darn

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
a little bit it looks pretty darn

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.920 
a little bit it looks pretty darn
straight<00:02:43.799> to<00:02:43.980> me<00:02:44.160> but<00:02:44.519> I<00:02:44.840> don't<00:02:45.840> know<00:02:45.900> the

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
straight to me but I don't know the

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.030 
straight to me but I don't know the
right<00:02:46.140> there<00:02:47.090> if<00:02:48.090> I<00:02:48.989> put<00:02:49.200> just<00:02:49.410> a<00:02:49.530> little<00:02:49.560> bit

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
right there if I put just a little bit

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.319 
right there if I put just a little bit
of<00:02:50.130> pressure<00:02:50.310> on<00:02:50.459> it<00:02:50.730> they<00:02:50.849> out<00:02:51.000> they<00:02:51.180> all

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
of pressure on it they out they all

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:53.930 
of pressure on it they out they all
spend<00:02:51.690> so<00:02:51.959> I'm<00:02:52.739> guessing<00:02:53.130> with<00:02:53.430> my<00:02:53.519> camera<00:02:53.790> on

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940
