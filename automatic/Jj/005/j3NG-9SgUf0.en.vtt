through all the colors here a bunch of

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:18.000 
through all the colors here a bunch of
different<00:00:15.790> settings<00:00:15.999> you<00:00:16.990> there's<00:00:17.529> a<00:00:17.590> strobe

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.010 
different settings you there's a strobe

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:20.009 
different settings you there's a strobe
we're<00:00:18.519> gonna<00:00:18.609> randomly<00:00:18.970> just<00:00:19.480> go<00:00:19.660> through

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:20.019 
we're gonna randomly just go through

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:22.830 
we're gonna randomly just go through
there's<00:00:20.740> like<00:00:21.730> a<00:00:21.760> smooth<00:00:22.180> one<00:00:22.510> where<00:00:22.720> it

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:22.840 
there's like a smooth one where it

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.439 
there's like a smooth one where it
graduates<00:00:23.679> in<00:00:23.830> and<00:00:23.980> out<00:00:24.130> there's<00:00:24.699> a<00:00:24.789> white<00:00:25.029> on

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:25.449 
graduates in and out there's a white on

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:27.810 
graduates in and out there's a white on
it<00:00:25.689> too<00:00:25.960> and<00:00:26.500> you<00:00:26.560> can<00:00:26.800> dim<00:00:27.039> that<00:00:27.250> up<00:00:27.429> and<00:00:27.580> down

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:27.820 
it too and you can dim that up and down

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.620 
it too and you can dim that up and down
so<00:00:28.359> it's<00:00:28.539> little<00:00:29.019> set<00:00:29.349> up<00:00:29.550> but<00:00:30.550> this<00:00:31.390> is<00:00:31.539> the

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:31.630 
so it's little set up but this is the

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.780 
so it's little set up but this is the
one<00:00:31.779> I<00:00:31.810> got<00:00:32.050> I'll<00:00:32.739> put<00:00:33.010> a<00:00:33.040> link<00:00:33.250> down<00:00:33.309> below<00:00:33.579> in

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:33.790 
one I got I'll put a link down below in

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.670 
one I got I'll put a link down below in
the<00:00:33.879> description<00:00:34.480> to<00:00:34.510> that<00:00:34.750> I<00:00:35.020> looked<00:00:35.530> online

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:35.680 
the description to that I looked online

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.790 
the description to that I looked online
for<00:00:35.920> quite<00:00:36.460> a<00:00:36.489> while<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.840> the<00:00:38.320> only<00:00:38.379> ones<00:00:38.680> I

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800 
for quite a while and the only ones I

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.110 
for quite a while and the only ones I
could<00:00:38.860> find<00:00:38.950> they're<00:00:39.280> quite<00:00:39.520> a<00:00:39.550> bit<00:00:39.730> cheaper

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.120 
could find they're quite a bit cheaper

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.180 
could find they're quite a bit cheaper

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
pack on them that you have to hook the

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.049 
pack on them that you have to hook the
remote<00:00:44.200> control<00:00:44.620> to<00:00:44.860> and<00:00:45.280> this<00:00:45.699> one<00:00:45.879> just

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:46.059
