sure that's fear you don't it sucks the
top<00:02:54.860> take<00:02:55.070> it<00:02:55.220> but<00:02:55.459> you<00:02:55.610> can<00:02:55.820> get<00:02:56.030> at<00:02:56.300> least

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
top take it but you can get at least

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.770 
top take it but you can get at least
well<00:02:58.430> if<00:02:58.519> they'll<00:02:58.700> have<00:02:59.000> the<00:02:59.209> hand<00:02:59.450> and<00:02:59.660> it's

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
well if they'll have the hand and it's

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.240 
well if they'll have the hand and it's
definitely<00:03:00.200> good<00:03:00.380> but<00:03:00.620> you<00:03:00.709> still<00:03:00.920> can<00:03:01.070> hit

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
definitely good but you still can hit

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.449 
definitely good but you still can hit
424<00:03:01.660> but<00:03:02.660> really<00:03:02.989> it's<00:03:03.530> for<00:03:03.800> like<00:03:03.950> synchro

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
424 but really it's for like synchro

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.370 
424 but really it's for like synchro
succeeds<00:03:04.940> and<00:03:05.269> if<00:03:05.450> they<00:03:05.570> set<00:03:05.870> a<00:03:05.900> monster<00:03:06.140> if

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
succeeds and if they set a monster if

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.780 
succeeds and if they set a monster if
they<00:03:06.470> start<00:03:06.769> slow<00:03:07.010> this<00:03:07.670> will<00:03:07.850> really<00:03:08.120> hurt

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
they start slow this will really hurt

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.970 
they start slow this will really hurt
so<00:03:09.420> tempo<00:03:09.780> changes<00:03:10.140> it's<00:03:10.439> definitely<00:03:10.709> a

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
so tempo changes it's definitely a

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.000 
so tempo changes it's definitely a
temperature<00:03:11.459> now<00:03:12.329> I<00:03:12.360> think<00:03:13.170> dark<00:03:13.469> dust<00:03:13.709> spirit

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
temperature now I think dark dust spirit

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.119 
temperature now I think dark dust spirit
is<00:03:14.250> just<00:03:14.909> necessary<00:03:15.180> I<00:03:15.719> think<00:03:16.079> only<00:03:16.290> one<00:03:16.650> yeah

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:17.129 
is just necessary I think only one yeah
