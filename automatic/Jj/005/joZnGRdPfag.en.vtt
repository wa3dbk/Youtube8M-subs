00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:06.670 
hi in this video I would like to

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:08.360 
hi in this video I would like to
demonstrate<00:00:06.790> a<00:00:07.149> very<00:00:07.509> cool<00:00:07.750> example

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
demonstrate a very cool example

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.140 
demonstrate a very cool example
demonstrating<00:00:09.370> connectivity<00:00:10.030> between

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:10.150 
demonstrating connectivity between

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.590 
demonstrating connectivity between
native<00:00:10.840> mobile<00:00:11.290> applications<00:00:11.469> and<00:00:12.600> Java

native mobile applications and Java
background<00:00:14.170> service<00:00:14.610> for<00:00:15.610> the<00:00:15.700> connectivity

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:16.269 
background service for the connectivity

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:18.630 
background service for the connectivity
i'm<00:00:16.510> going<00:00:16.869> to<00:00:17.080> use<00:00:17.260> web<00:00:17.529> work<00:00:17.710> for<00:00:17.920> java<00:00:18.189> which

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:18.640 
i'm going to use web work for java which

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.210 
i'm going to use web work for java which
hosts<00:00:19.180> the<00:00:19.240> actual<00:00:19.689> service<00:00:20.050> and<00:00:20.259> as<00:00:20.949> far<00:00:21.099> as

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:21.220 
hosts the actual service and as far as

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.979 
hosts the actual service and as far as
the<00:00:21.339> mobile<00:00:21.579> devices<00:00:22.029> we<00:00:22.300> have<00:00:22.480> three

00:00:22.979 --> 00:00:22.989 
the mobile devices we have three

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:25.409 
the mobile devices we have three
different<00:00:23.019> devices<00:00:23.560> there<00:00:24.369> is<00:00:24.489> a<00:00:24.519> knife<00:00:25.150> own

00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:25.419 
different devices there is a knife own

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:28.380 
different devices there is a knife own
an<00:00:25.650> android<00:00:26.650> phone<00:00:26.679> and<00:00:27.249> the<00:00:27.849> windows<00:00:28.179> mobile

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:28.390 
an android phone and the windows mobile

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.749 
an android phone and the windows mobile
phone<00:00:28.749> what<00:00:29.710> makes<00:00:29.919> this<00:00:30.099> interesting<00:00:30.310> is

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:30.759 
phone what makes this interesting is

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:32.519 
phone what makes this interesting is
that<00:00:30.789> the<00:00:31.149> applications<00:00:31.869> running<00:00:32.140> on<00:00:32.320> these

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:32.529 
that the applications running on these

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:35.970 
that the applications running on these
phones<00:00:32.739> are<00:00:33.810> different<00:00:34.810> compilations<00:00:35.410> of<00:00:35.920> the

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
phones are different compilations of the

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.490 
phones are different compilations of the
same<00:00:36.340> app<00:00:36.550> so<00:00:37.449> for<00:00:37.629> the<00:00:37.690> iphone<00:00:38.109> we<00:00:38.320> have<00:00:38.469> a

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:38.500 
same app so for the iphone we have a

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.520 
same app so for the iphone we have a
native<00:00:38.949> iOS<00:00:39.780> implementation<00:00:40.780> for<00:00:41.410> the

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:41.530 
native iOS implementation for the

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.200 
native iOS implementation for the
android<00:00:41.980> it<00:00:42.280> is<00:00:42.399> a<00:00:42.429> native<00:00:42.789> java

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
android it is a native java

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.619 
android it is a native java
implementation<00:00:44.109> and<00:00:44.920> for<00:00:45.550> windows<00:00:45.910> mobile<00:00:46.149> it

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:46.629 
implementation and for windows mobile it

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:48.959 
implementation and for windows mobile it
is<00:00:46.780> a<00:00:46.809> silverlight<00:00:47.379> application<00:00:47.820> now<00:00:48.820> these

00:00:48.959 --> 00:00:48.969 
is a silverlight application now these

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:51.900 
is a silverlight application now these
applications<00:00:49.629> use<00:00:49.960> the<00:00:50.489> libraries<00:00:51.489> which<00:00:51.730> we

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
applications use the libraries which we

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.270 
applications use the libraries which we
provide<00:00:52.269> for<00:00:52.539> each<00:00:52.690> of<00:00:52.870> these<00:00:52.989> devices<00:00:53.379> we

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 
provide for each of these devices we

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.180 
provide for each of these devices we
have<00:00:54.460> a<00:00:54.489> library<00:00:54.820> for<00:00:55.239> iOS<00:00:55.690> a<00:00:55.929> Java<00:00:56.679> library

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
have a library for iOS a Java library

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.549 
have a library for iOS a Java library
for<00:00:57.429> android<00:00:57.850> apps<00:00:58.089> and<00:00:58.329> a<00:00:58.660> civil<00:00:58.960> I'd<00:00:59.079> library

for the windows mobile applications

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:04.160 
for the windows mobile applications
these<00:01:02.260> libraries<00:01:02.890> provide<00:01:03.100> connectivity

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
these libraries provide connectivity

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.940 
these libraries provide connectivity
infrastructure<00:01:05.170> between<00:01:05.680> a<00:01:05.710> mobile

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
infrastructure between a mobile

application and the backend the

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.410 
application and the backend the
connectivity<00:01:09.250> between<00:01:09.370> these<00:01:09.760> applications

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
connectivity between these applications

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.020 
connectivity between these applications
is<00:01:10.630> actually<00:01:11.230> slightly<00:01:11.440> different

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
is actually slightly different

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.610 
is actually slightly different
specifically<00:01:13.030> for<00:01:13.120> the<00:01:13.390> iphone<00:01:13.870> application

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:14.620 
specifically for the iphone application

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.930 
specifically for the iphone application
the<00:01:15.490> connectivity<00:01:16.060> is<00:01:16.150> done<00:01:16.390> via<00:01:16.470> rtmp<00:01:17.470> as<00:01:17.940> a

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:18.940 
the connectivity is done via rtmp as a

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.610 
the connectivity is done via rtmp as a
result<00:01:19.240> the<00:01:19.690> updates<00:01:20.050> that<00:01:20.290> the<00:01:20.410> server

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:20.620 
result the updates that the server

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.280 
result the updates that the server
brings<00:01:20.950> in<00:01:21.190> are<00:01:21.340> more<00:01:22.000> real-time<00:01:22.210> in<00:01:22.780> case<00:01:23.140> of

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
brings in are more real-time in case of

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.730 
brings in are more real-time in case of
iphone<00:01:23.710> as<00:01:23.920> far<00:01:24.880> as<00:01:24.970> the<00:01:25.150> android<00:01:25.720> and<00:01:26.020> windows

iphone as far as the android and windows
mobile<00:01:27.190> phones<00:01:27.610> they<00:01:28.570> use<00:01:28.720> polling<00:01:29.170> as<00:01:29.320> a

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
mobile phones they use polling as a

mobile phones they use polling as a
result<00:01:30.640> the<00:01:30.820> updates<00:01:31.180> coming<00:01:31.300> into<00:01:31.780> these

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
result the updates coming into these

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.930 
result the updates coming into these
phones<00:01:32.290> are<00:01:32.560> going<00:01:33.040> to<00:01:33.100> be<00:01:33.190> either<00:01:33.400> slightly

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
phones are going to be either slightly

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.340 
phones are going to be either slightly
behind<00:01:34.270> or<00:01:35.050> about<00:01:35.380> the<00:01:35.590> same<00:01:35.620> as<00:01:36.040> with<00:01:36.670> iphone

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
behind or about the same as with iphone

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.160 
behind or about the same as with iphone
nevertheless<00:01:38.910> the<00:01:39.910> effect<00:01:40.300> is<00:01:40.690> striking

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
nevertheless the effect is striking

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.050 
nevertheless the effect is striking
because<00:01:41.320> all<00:01:41.680> these<00:01:41.950> three<00:01:42.250> phones<00:01:42.460> written

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
because all these three phones written

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.420 
because all these three phones written
in<00:01:43.180> very<00:01:43.630> different<00:01:43.930> environments<00:01:44.590> do

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
in very different environments do

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.760 
in very different environments do
receive<00:01:45.820> the<00:01:45.970> data<00:01:46.150> in<00:01:46.450> real<00:01:46.750> time<00:01:46.780> or<00:01:47.260> close

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
receive the data in real time or close

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.350 
receive the data in real time or close
to<00:01:47.980> real<00:01:48.100> time<00:01:48.130> and<00:01:48.610> they're<00:01:49.210> always

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
to real time and they're always

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.200 
to real time and they're always
synchronized<00:01:49.960> I<00:01:50.580> will<00:01:51.580> also<00:01:51.820> review<00:01:52.060> the

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
to my favorite ID editor which is idea

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.190 
to my favorite ID editor which is idea
and<00:02:12.750> will<00:02:13.750> demonstrate<00:02:13.990> how<00:02:14.470> this<00:02:14.650> code<00:02:14.920> works

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
and will demonstrate how this code works

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.550 
and will demonstrate how this code works
exactly<00:02:17.190> the<00:02:17.250> same<00:02:17.400> code<00:02:17.640> can<00:02:18.300> be<00:02:18.560> compiled

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
exactly the same code can be compiled

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.140 
exactly the same code can be compiled
and<00:02:19.860> developed<00:02:20.550> in<00:02:20.730> eclipse<00:02:21.510> or<00:02:21.720> any<00:02:22.019> other<00:02:22.260> ID

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
and developed in eclipse or any other ID

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.729 
and developed in eclipse or any other ID
so<00:02:24.150> right<00:02:24.330> here<00:02:24.360> in<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:24.959> app<00:02:25.110> start<00:02:25.530> method

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
so right here in the app start method

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.070 
so right here in the app start method
which<00:02:26.430> is<00:02:26.580> invoked<00:02:26.940> when<00:02:27.060> web<00:02:27.360> warp<00:02:27.569> starts<00:02:27.900> up

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
which is invoked when web warp starts up

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.820 
which is invoked when web warp starts up
I'm<00:02:28.860> going<00:02:29.069> to<00:02:29.250> initialize<00:02:29.580> the<00:02:29.940> companies<00:02:30.830> so

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
I'm going to initialize the companies so

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.839 
I'm going to initialize the companies so
this<00:02:31.980> is<00:02:32.010> all<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.550> static<00:02:33.239> data<00:02:33.540> that<00:02:34.110> is<00:02:34.380> used

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
this is all the static data that is used

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.490 
this is all the static data that is used
it's<00:02:35.849> a<00:02:35.940> list<00:02:36.150> of<00:02:36.269> companies<00:02:36.720> is<00:02:36.900> static<00:02:37.319> but

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
it's a list of companies is static but

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.930 
it's a list of companies is static but
that<00:02:37.620> is<00:02:37.739> beyond<00:02:38.040> the<00:02:38.130> point<00:02:38.310> because<00:02:38.790> the

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
that is beyond the point because the

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.070 
that is beyond the point because the
point<00:02:39.120> here<00:02:39.569> is<00:02:39.720> to<00:02:39.780> demonstrate

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
point here is to demonstrate

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.830 
point here is to demonstrate
connectivity<00:02:41.040> I'm<00:02:41.849> going<00:02:42.060> to<00:02:42.180> also<00:02:42.330> allocate

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
connectivity I'm going to also allocate

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.520 
connectivity I'm going to also allocate
a<00:02:42.870> timer<00:02:43.140> and<00:02:43.380> that<00:02:43.769> timer<00:02:44.040> is<00:02:44.370> fired<00:02:44.760> every

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
a timer and that timer is fired every

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.920 
a timer and that timer is fired every
fifteen<00:02:46.530> hundred<00:02:46.860> milliseconds<00:02:47.840> whenever<00:02:48.840> it

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
fifteen hundred milliseconds whenever it

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.729 
fifteen hundred milliseconds whenever it
is<00:02:48.989> fired<00:02:50.150> it's<00:02:51.150> going<00:02:51.599> to<00:02:51.810> invoke<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.380> update

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
is fired it's going to invoke the update

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:57.170 
is fired it's going to invoke the update
task<00:02:53.069> and<00:02:54.110> this<00:02:55.110> update<00:02:55.440> task<00:02:55.819> when<00:02:56.819> it<00:02:56.940> runs

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
task and this update task when it runs

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.949 
task and this update task when it runs
will<00:02:57.599> just<00:02:57.840> invoke<00:02:58.200> update<00:02:58.769> stock<00:02:59.069> data
