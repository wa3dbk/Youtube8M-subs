00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
so I tie mine with one loop the tree and

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.690 
so I tie mine with one loop the tree and
the<00:02:27.330> bunny<00:02:27.540> going<00:02:27.840> around<00:02:28.260> and<00:02:28.590> through<00:02:29.519> the

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
the bunny going around and through the

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.479 
the bunny going around and through the
hole<00:02:31.730> Mindy<00:02:32.730> I<00:02:33.290> tie<00:02:34.290> mine<00:02:34.560> by<00:02:34.860> making<00:02:35.220> two

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
hole Mindy I tie mine by making two

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.690 
hole Mindy I tie mine by making two
loops<00:02:35.519> uh<00:02:36.290> and<00:02:37.290> then<00:02:37.920> just<00:02:38.160> crossing<00:02:38.610> them

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
loops uh and then just crossing them

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.570 
loops uh and then just crossing them
over<00:02:38.850> and<00:02:39.269> tying<00:02:39.870> them<00:02:39.900> under<00:02:40.319> and<00:02:40.620> then

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
over and tying them under and then

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.740 
over and tying them under and then
pulling<00:02:41.850> so<00:02:42.720> this<00:02:42.900> will<00:02:43.080> be<00:02:43.230> the<00:02:43.410> great<00:02:43.620> debate

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
pulling so this will be the great debate

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.380 
pulling so this will be the great debate
we<00:02:45.750> want<00:02:45.959> to<00:02:46.050> know<00:02:46.170> how<00:02:46.410> you<00:02:46.470> tie<00:02:46.800> your<00:02:47.010> bows

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
we want to know how you tie your bows

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.070 
we want to know how you tie your bows
and<00:02:48.390> I<00:02:48.780> think<00:02:49.019> her<00:02:49.230> way<00:02:49.380> is<00:02:49.440> crazy<00:02:49.890> no<00:02:50.810> no<00:02:51.810> no<00:02:51.870> no

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
and I think her way is crazy no no no no

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.420 
and I think her way is crazy no no no no
she's<00:02:52.620> also<00:02:52.800> a<00:02:52.980> lefty<00:02:53.459> that's<00:02:53.700> probably<00:02:54.150> why

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
she's also a lefty that's probably why

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.060 
she's also a lefty that's probably why
and<00:02:56.430> then<00:02:56.790> so<00:02:57.570> that<00:02:57.600> the<00:02:57.989> edges<00:02:58.470> don't<00:02:58.680> fray

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
and then so that the edges don't fray

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:04.009 
and then so that the edges don't fray
off<00:02:59.310> you<00:02:59.760> take<00:03:00.000> a<00:03:00.950> match<00:03:01.950> or<00:03:02.400> some<00:03:02.610> heat<00:03:03.019> and

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
off you take a match or some heat and

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:09.470 
off you take a match or some heat and
you<00:03:04.410> just<00:03:04.700> really<00:03:07.070> lightly<00:03:08.070> burn<00:03:08.880> the<00:03:09.120> tip<00:03:09.329> of

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
you just really lightly burn the tip of

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.170 
you just really lightly burn the tip of
it<00:03:09.630> and<00:03:09.810> that<00:03:10.019> will<00:03:10.170> keep<00:03:10.350> it<00:03:10.500> from<00:03:10.560> fraying

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
it and that will keep it from fraying

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:17.630 
it and that will keep it from fraying
and<00:03:12.380> then<00:03:15.049> just<00:03:16.049> going<00:03:16.260> to<00:03:16.350> take<00:03:16.560> my<00:03:16.860> go<00:03:17.070> a

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
and then just going to take my go a

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:23.360 
and then just going to take my go a
little<00:03:18.299> more<00:03:18.690> dalla<00:03:18.989> before<00:03:19.500> you<00:03:22.190> find<00:03:23.190> your
