of like a little cave Harry I'm just
grabbing<00:01:28.110> some<00:01:28.409> spin<00:01:28.619> metal<00:01:28.860> leaves<00:01:29.009> and

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
grabbing some spin metal leaves and

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.920 
grabbing some spin metal leaves and
again<00:01:29.640> these<00:01:29.909> things<00:01:30.000> are<00:01:30.180> hard<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.450> spot<00:01:30.659> but

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
again these things are hard to spot but

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.600 
again these things are hard to spot but
if<00:01:31.020> it's<00:01:31.170> quiet<00:01:31.439> you<00:01:31.979> could<00:01:32.130> actually<00:01:32.250> hear

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
if it's quiet you could actually hear

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.950 
if it's quiet you could actually hear

00:02:14.429 --> 00:02:14.439 
one up above usually you don't get them

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:15.690 
one up above usually you don't get them
that<00:02:14.560> close<00:02:14.769> together<00:02:14.980> then<00:02:15.459> we're<00:02:15.549> going<00:02:15.640> to

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
that close together then we're going to

break off to our right another really

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:19.349 
break off to our right another really
cool<00:02:18.010> thing<00:02:18.069> about<00:02:18.430> all<00:02:18.730> of<00:02:18.760> these<00:02:18.999> farming

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:19.359 
cool thing about all of these farming

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:21.239 
cool thing about all of these farming
areas<00:02:19.659> is<00:02:19.810> that<00:02:19.959> they<00:02:20.290> because<00:02:20.980> they're<00:02:21.099> in<00:02:21.189> a

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:21.249 
areas is that they because they're in a

00:02:21.249 --> 00:02:23.160 
areas is that they because they're in a
circle<00:02:21.579> and<00:02:21.819> there's<00:02:22.299> also<00:02:22.450> public<00:02:22.840> events

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
circle and there's also public events

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.899 
circle and there's also public events
that<00:02:23.290> spawn<00:02:23.560> him<00:02:23.739> so<00:02:24.219> if<00:02:24.519> you<00:02:24.639> keep<00:02:24.879> doing

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:24.909 
that spawn him so if you keep doing

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:27.000 
that spawn him so if you keep doing
these<00:02:25.569> circles<00:02:26.019> over<00:02:26.260> and<00:02:26.319> over<00:02:26.469> collecting

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
these circles over and over collecting

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.160 
these circles over and over collecting
loot<00:02:27.159> chests<00:02:27.519> and<00:02:27.700> spindles<00:02:28.150> you<00:02:28.719> probably

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
loot chests and spindles you probably

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.839 
loot chests and spindles you probably
eventually<00:02:29.379> well<00:02:29.859> I'd<00:02:30.040> say<00:02:30.250> you<00:02:30.310> get<00:02:30.579> one

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849 
eventually well I'd say you get one

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.509 
eventually well I'd say you get one
maybe<00:02:31.269> two<00:02:31.420> public<00:02:32.049> events<00:02:32.409> which<00:02:32.620> you<00:02:33.430> know

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
maybe two public events which you know

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:34.500 
maybe two public events which you know
they're<00:02:33.639> hard<00:02:33.790> to<00:02:33.819> come<00:02:33.939> by<00:02:34.060> especially<00:02:34.090> if

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
they're hard to come by especially if

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:35.640 
they're hard to come by especially if
you<00:02:34.569> get<00:02:34.659> that<00:02:34.780> bounty<00:02:35.139> where<00:02:35.230> you<00:02:35.290> got<00:02:35.409> to<00:02:35.439> get

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
you get that bounty where you got to get

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.890 
you get that bounty where you got to get
three<00:02:35.950> of<00:02:35.980> the<00:02:36.250> gold<00:02:36.459> tier<00:02:36.700> ones<00:02:36.939> also<00:02:37.329> that's

three of the gold tier ones also that's

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.990 
three of the gold tier ones also that's
a<00:02:38.019> great<00:02:38.260> way<00:02:38.409> of<00:02:38.439> getting<00:02:38.859> ascendance<00:02:39.519> Isetta

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
a great way of getting ascendance Isetta

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.089 
a great way of getting ascendance Isetta
energies<00:02:40.419> of<00:02:40.569> shards<00:02:40.840> I<00:02:40.959> I<00:02:41.230> forget<00:02:41.950> which<00:02:42.040> one
