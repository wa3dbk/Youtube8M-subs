00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.969 

thinking<00:00:00.299> about<00:00:00.659> the<00:00:00.840> trajectory<00:00:01.439> analysis

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
thinking about the trajectory analysis

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:04.579 
thinking about the trajectory analysis
we<00:00:02.669> were<00:00:02.820> thinking<00:00:03.389> at<00:00:04.020> least<00:00:04.200> initially

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
we were thinking at least initially

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.849 
we were thinking at least initially
about<00:00:05.220> the<00:00:05.970> vertical<00:00:06.509> plane<00:00:06.690> that<00:00:07.200> same<00:00:07.649> up

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
about the vertical plane that same up

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.190 
about the vertical plane that same up
and<00:00:08.040> down<00:00:08.220> on<00:00:08.580> the<00:00:08.639> trajectory<00:00:09.330> how<00:00:09.870> high<00:00:10.139> the

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
and down on the trajectory how high the

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.670 
and down on the trajectory how high the
gun<00:00:10.950> was<00:00:11.250> minus<00:00:12.030> five<00:00:12.300> great<00:00:12.660> please<00:00:14.690> you<00:00:15.690> also

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
gun was minus five great please you also

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.890 
gun was minus five great please you also
could<00:00:17.340> have<00:00:17.400> done<00:00:17.760> in<00:00:17.910> trajectory<00:00:18.480> analysis

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900

right<00:01:09.470> and<00:01:10.470> then<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.610> inner<00:01:11.939> side<00:01:12.510> of<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.869> rod

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
right and then the inner side of the rod

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.219 
right and then the inner side of the rod
is<00:01:13.650> up<00:01:14.640> against<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.119> tire<00:01:15.390> or<00:01:15.689> in<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.020> whole

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
of the tire rate okay and then you have

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.350 
of the tire rate okay and then you have
some<00:01:19.530> movement<00:01:20.130> back<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.400> forth<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.060> rod

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
some movement back and forth of the rod

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.520 
some movement back and forth of the rod
side<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.990> side<00:01:22.170> right<00:01:22.530> now<00:01:24.049> if<00:01:25.049> you've<00:01:25.380> been

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
side to side right now if you've been

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.890 
side to side right now if you've been
chosen<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:26.430> who<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.759> push<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.210> rod<00:01:27.390> as<00:01:27.600> far

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
chosen to you who to push the rod as far

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.630 
chosen to you who to push the rod as far
to<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.140> right<00:01:28.259> as<00:01:28.470> you<00:01:28.770> could<00:01:29.070> have<00:01:29.159> pushed<00:01:29.430> it

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
to the right as you could have pushed it

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.810 
to the right as you could have pushed it
and<00:01:29.909> then<00:01:30.810> done<00:01:31.200> an<00:01:31.500> analysis<00:01:32.159> let<00:01:32.460> your<00:01:32.640> tech

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
and then done an analysis let your tech

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.149 
and then done an analysis let your tech
tree<00:01:33.030> from<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.270> air<00:01:33.509> right<00:01:33.950> would<00:01:34.950> have<00:01:35.040> been

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
tree from the air right would have been

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.030 
tree from the air right would have been
accurate<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:36.270> could<00:01:36.509> have<00:01:36.600> done<00:01:36.780> that<00:01:36.840> right

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
accurate you could have done that right

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.100 
accurate you could have done that right
man<00:01:39.640> your<00:01:39.850> turn<00:01:40.060> and<00:01:40.300> you<00:01:40.330> could<00:01:40.720> have<00:01:40.840> done<00:01:41.080> it

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
man your turn and you could have done it

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.100 
man your turn and you could have done it
the<00:01:41.380> same<00:01:41.650> way<00:01:41.950> to<00:01:42.010> the<00:01:42.370> left<00:01:42.640> right<00:01:42.940> as<00:01:43.570> far<00:01:43.930> as

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
the same way to the left right as far as

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.470 
the same way to the left right as far as
you<00:01:44.260> could<00:01:44.470> write<00:01:45.370> and<00:01:45.820> I'm<00:01:45.970> going<00:01:46.150> to<00:01:46.180> be<00:01:46.330> late

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:46.480 
you could write and I'm going to be late

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.200 
you could write and I'm going to be late
again<00:01:46.600> so<00:01:47.110> the<00:01:47.350> answer<00:01:47.380> you're<00:01:48.340> doing<00:01:48.700> it<00:01:48.910> to

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
again so the answer you're doing it to

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.810 
again so the answer you're doing it to
the<00:01:49.390> extent<00:01:50.080> of<00:01:50.290> the<00:01:50.620> margin<00:01:51.130> of<00:01:51.190> error<00:01:51.460> in

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
the extent of the margin of error in

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.930 
the extent of the margin of error in
your<00:01:51.970> analysis<00:01:52.630> right<00:01:52.900> right<00:01:53.680> all<00:01:54.370> right<00:01:54.580> and

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
your analysis right right all right and

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.940 
your analysis right right all right and
the<00:01:55.120> margin<00:01:55.570> of<00:01:55.630> error<00:01:55.810> urinalysis<00:01:56.440> you

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
the margin of error urinalysis you

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.640 
the margin of error urinalysis you
calculated<00:01:57.700> as<00:01:57.940> two<00:01:58.300> degrees<00:01:58.690> plus<00:01:59.110> or<00:01:59.290> minus

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
calculated as two degrees plus or minus

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.850 
calculated as two degrees plus or minus
right<00:01:59.890> no<00:02:00.340> that's<00:02:00.640> the<00:02:01.050> difference<00:02:02.050> i<00:02:02.410> noted

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
right no that's the difference i noted

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.719 
right no that's the difference i noted
just<00:02:03.460> from<00:02:03.640> changing<00:02:04.150> with<00:02:04.360> the<00:02:05.550> angle<00:02:06.550> meter

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
just from changing with the angle meter

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.330 
just from changing with the angle meter
on<00:02:07.000> it<00:02:07.240> i<00:02:07.360> have<00:02:08.229> a<00:02:08.290> lot<00:02:08.440> me<00:02:08.560> kind<00:02:08.800> of<00:02:08.860> took<00:02:09.040> in<00:02:09.190> it

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
on it i have a lot me kind of took in it

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.430 
on it i have a lot me kind of took in it
and<00:02:09.550> just<00:02:09.940> you<00:02:10.420> know<00:02:10.479> if<00:02:10.660> i<00:02:10.810> wanted<00:02:11.110> to<00:02:11.170> really

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
and just you know if i wanted to really

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.020 
and just you know if i wanted to really
push<00:02:11.709> it<00:02:11.860> i<00:02:11.950> thought<00:02:12.160> i<00:02:12.220> could<00:02:12.400> push<00:02:12.670> that<00:02:12.850> I

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
push it i thought i could push that I

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.890 
push it i thought i could push that I
just<00:02:13.420> noted<00:02:13.810> that<00:02:14.530> when<00:02:15.250> we<00:02:15.430> had<00:02:15.910> the<00:02:16.270> rod<00:02:16.570> in

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
just noted that when we had the rod in

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.990 
just noted that when we had the rod in
the<00:02:16.959> tire<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:17.830> people<00:02:18.160> we<00:02:18.340> put<00:02:18.610> it<00:02:18.730> would<00:02:18.880> go

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
the tire the people we put it would go

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.630 
the tire the people we put it would go
up<00:02:19.180> and<00:02:19.330> down<00:02:19.480> two<00:02:20.080> degrees<00:02:20.470> say<00:02:20.980> I<00:02:21.220> didn't

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
up and down two degrees say I didn't

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.760 
up and down two degrees say I didn't
take<00:02:21.820> it<00:02:21.880> and<00:02:22.330> go<00:02:22.690> actually<00:02:23.410> made<00:02:23.620> you

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
take it and go actually made you

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.680 
take it and go actually made you
manipulate<00:02:24.340> and<00:02:24.459> force<00:02:24.820> it<00:02:24.970> up<00:02:25.150> and<00:02:25.360> then<00:02:25.450> grab

trajectory analysis you did not

bullet may have been fired from right I

bullet may have been fired from right I
couldn't<00:06:00.629> define<00:06:00.989> through<00:06:01.709> so<00:06:01.919> many

couldn't define through so many

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:04.189 
couldn't define through so many

reliable<00:06:04.799> at<00:06:04.889> all<00:06:05.009> that's<00:06:05.339> why<00:06:05.489> I<00:06:05.549> decided<00:06:05.729> not

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:06.149 
reliable at all that's why I decided not

to<00:06:06.269> do<00:06:06.419> it<00:06:06.539> you<00:06:07.169> have<00:06:07.229> to<00:06:07.349> have<00:06:07.529> reliability<00:06:08.629> in

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:09.629 
to do it you have to have reliability in

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:11.029 
to do it you have to have reliability in

reproduce and we will reproduce it was
just<00:06:13.589> that<00:06:13.769> there's<00:06:14.189> so<00:06:14.219> much<00:06:14.399> variation<00:06:14.789> of
