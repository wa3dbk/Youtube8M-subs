00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:04.220 

so<00:00:01.469> here<00:00:02.280> we<00:00:02.370> have<00:00:02.490> one<00:00:02.639> receiver<00:00:02.970> it<00:00:03.929> is<00:00:04.080> the

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
so here we have one receiver it is the

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:05.749 
so here we have one receiver it is the
receiver<00:00:04.589> which<00:00:04.770> was<00:00:04.950> sent<00:00:05.190> back<00:00:05.310> to<00:00:05.370> me<00:00:05.580> as

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
receiver which was sent back to me as

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.190 
receiver which was sent back to me as
you<00:00:05.910> can<00:00:06.089> see<00:00:06.359> because<00:00:06.509> there's<00:00:06.839> the<00:00:07.020> damage

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
you can see because there's the damage

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.490 
you can see because there's the damage
which<00:00:07.529> you<00:00:07.710> referred<00:00:08.069> to<00:00:08.099> I<00:00:09.090> believe<00:00:09.840> this<00:00:10.260> may

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
which you referred to I believe this may

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.839 
which you referred to I believe this may
have<00:00:10.590> been<00:00:10.740> caused<00:00:10.950> by<00:00:11.190> trying<00:00:11.400> to<00:00:11.519> pull<00:00:11.700> this

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
have been caused by trying to pull this

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.539 
have been caused by trying to pull this
off<00:00:12.090> and<00:00:12.330> it's<00:00:13.170> just<00:00:13.380> too<00:00:13.920> much<00:00:14.040> force<00:00:14.340> is

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
off and it's just too much force is

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.670 
off and it's just too much force is
actually<00:00:14.849> practical<00:00:15.089> it's<00:00:15.960> on<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.350> the

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
actually practical it's on the the

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.240 
actually practical it's on the the
actual<00:00:16.980> lines<00:00:17.279> where<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.760> joins<00:00:17.970> are<00:00:19.010> but<00:00:20.010> I'm

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
actual lines where the joins are but I'm

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.590 
actual lines where the joins are but I'm
not<00:00:20.490> saying<00:00:20.670> that<00:00:20.850> they<00:00:20.970> is<00:00:21.119> what<00:00:21.270> happened

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
not saying that they is what happened

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.849 
not saying that they is what happened
it's<00:00:21.750> just<00:00:21.779> that's<00:00:22.199> what<00:00:22.350> it<00:00:22.439> looks<00:00:22.590> like<00:00:22.710> to

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
it's just that's what it looks like to

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.290 
it's just that's what it looks like to
me<00:00:22.890> it<00:00:23.160> definitely<00:00:23.310> wasn't<00:00:23.699> like<00:00:23.910> this<00:00:24.060> when<00:00:24.119> I

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
me it definitely wasn't like this when I

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.330 
me it definitely wasn't like this when I
sent<00:00:24.570> it<00:00:24.769> anyway<00:00:25.769> there's<00:00:26.400> your<00:00:26.550> receiver

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
sent it anyway there's your receiver

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:35.440 
sent it anyway there's your receiver
here's<00:00:30.109> will<00:00:31.109> just<00:00:31.320> create<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.679> new<00:00:31.859> model<00:00:32.210> so

new model turn the receive the
transmitter<00:00:43.559> back<00:00:43.739> off<00:00:45.050> we<00:00:46.050> have<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:47.719> battery

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
transmitter back off we have a battery

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.650 
transmitter back off we have a battery
pack<00:00:50.360> find<00:00:51.360> plug<00:00:52.789> and<00:00:53.789> I've<00:00:53.969> got<00:00:54.120> some<00:00:54.270> servos

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
pack find plug and I've got some servos

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.350 
pack find plug and I've got some servos
here<00:00:54.870> just<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.350> check<00:00:56.070> so<00:00:56.820> first<00:00:57.090> thing<00:00:57.239> I'll

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
here just to check so first thing I'll

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.970 
here just to check so first thing I'll
do<00:00:57.539> is<00:00:58.100> plug<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.520> bone<00:00:59.730> plug<00:01:00.059> into<00:01:00.800> the<00:01:01.800> bone

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
do is plug the bone plug into the bone

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.460 
do is plug the bone plug into the bone
port<00:01:03.530> like<00:01:04.530> so<00:01:05.360> as<00:01:06.360> you<00:01:06.510> can<00:01:06.600> see<00:01:06.720> by<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.229> plug

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
port like so as you can see by the plug

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:14.480 
port like so as you can see by the plug
in<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.890> bottom<00:01:08.040> port<00:01:08.369> I<00:01:10.790> will<00:01:11.790> then<00:01:11.939> plug<00:01:13.490> I'll

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
in the bottom port I will then plug I'll

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.730 
in the bottom port I will then plug I'll
leave<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.850> servos<00:01:15.240> for<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.450> moment<00:01:15.720> if<00:01:16.590> I

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
leave the servos for the moment if I

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.070 
leave the servos for the moment if I
plug<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.189> battery<00:01:17.310> into<00:01:17.970> any<00:01:18.299> of<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.720> servo

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
plug the battery into any of the servo

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.539 
plug the battery into any of the servo
ports<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.470> doesn't<00:01:19.740> matter<00:01:19.860> which<00:01:20.040> as<00:01:20.310> long<00:01:20.430> as

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
ports it doesn't matter which as long as

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.810 
ports it doesn't matter which as long as
it's<00:01:20.700> got<00:01:20.790> power<00:01:21.259> so<00:01:22.259> for<00:01:23.009> example<00:01:23.430> here<00:01:23.640> I've

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
it's got power so for example here I've

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.740 
it's got power so for example here I've
gone<00:01:24.000> into<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.630> gear<00:01:24.840> port<00:01:26.150> as<00:01:27.150> we<00:01:27.270> can<00:01:27.420> see<00:01:27.570> is

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
gone into the gear port as we can see is

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.700 
gone into the gear port as we can see is
ready<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.110> bind<00:01:29.240> bundle<00:01:30.240> is<00:01:31.140> on<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.380> back<00:01:31.530> of

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
ready to bind bundle is on the back of

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.550 
ready to bind bundle is on the back of
this<00:01:31.890> so<00:01:32.220> I<00:01:32.280> hold<00:01:32.490> in<00:01:32.640> my<00:01:32.670> bind<00:01:32.970> plug<00:01:33.409> turn<00:01:34.409> on

got the lead the right way around and as

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.040 
got the lead the right way around and as
we<00:02:37.030> can<00:02:37.150> see<00:02:37.209> the<00:02:37.690> receiver<00:02:38.019> has<00:02:38.230> bound<00:02:40.050> just

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
we can see the receiver has bound just

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.559 
we can see the receiver has bound just
zoom<00:02:41.410> in<00:02:41.560> a<00:02:41.650> bit<00:02:41.730> you<00:02:42.730> can<00:02:42.760> see<00:02:43.060> both<00:02:43.269> of<00:02:43.450> them

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
zoom in a bit you can see both of them

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.750 
zoom in a bit you can see both of them
at<00:02:43.660> the<00:02:43.870> solid<00:02:44.080> orange<00:02:44.319> light<00:02:44.670> if<00:02:45.670> I<00:02:45.819> now<00:02:46.030> oops

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
at the solid orange light if I now oops

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:55.350 
at the solid orange light if I now oops
but<00:02:48.760> fly<00:02:49.000> rudder<00:02:51.120> aileron<00:02:52.120> and<00:02:53.519> elevator<00:02:54.519> this

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
but fly rudder aileron and elevator this

is<00:02:55.510> a<00:02:55.540> heli<00:02:55.780> model<00:02:56.110> so<00:02:56.230> it's<00:02:56.319> actually<00:02:56.500> doing<00:02:56.769> a

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
is a heli model so it's actually doing a

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.220 
is a heli model so it's actually doing a
bit<00:02:56.980> of<00:02:57.069> mixing<00:02:57.370> I<00:02:57.489> think<00:02:57.700> but<00:02:58.080> you<00:02:59.080> can

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
bit of mixing I think but you can

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.870 
bit of mixing I think but you can
clearly<00:02:59.530> see<00:02:59.650> that<00:03:00.010> all<00:03:00.100> three<00:03:00.310> surveys<00:03:00.670> are

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
clearly see that all three surveys are

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:10.380 
clearly see that all three surveys are
working<00:03:05.790> so<00:03:06.790> one<00:03:07.390> working<00:03:07.780> receiver
