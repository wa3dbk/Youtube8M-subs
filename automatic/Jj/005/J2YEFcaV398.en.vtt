 Hello everyone today will be short 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:16.160
 an overview of a very interesting device is 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.930
 wireless keyboard rapoo e2700 and we 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.090
 probably the first question that you have 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.130
 Why does it arise? 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.360
 small wireless with small 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:28.010
 the buttons will answer why I took it myself 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.449
 imagine the situation you invite 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.820
 to yourself a bunch of friends 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:34.219
 seat them on a soft sofa in front 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.230
 huge tv or if someone 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:37.250
 like i only have a small 27 inch 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.159
 monitor 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.469
 then in front of him and here you sit all on 

00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:44.870
 See a sofa for example a movie and suddenly 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:47.839
 someone needs to move away you get up from the couch 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.449
 press the pause button on the keyboard and 

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:50.960
 so on or for example show your 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:52.999
 a photo 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.280
 everybody is sitting on the couch and we need 

00:00:52.999 --> 00:00:57.859
 sit somewhere near the keyboard and and 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.409
 click on the arrow to expand the photo 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:03.339
 and so on or if you collected a bunch in 

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:06.260
 guests in the apartment sat them at the table and 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:08.450
 switch music tracks on computer 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.180
 such as flipping through the run again 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.640
 here and there from there to here it's all very day 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.830
 do for example like me and that is why 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.130
 I bought myself such a small one 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.770

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.500

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.380

 you do not need extra wireless 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.460
 the mouse can do all this on this 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.620
 Here is a compact device but the main one 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.550
 Of course the purpose of this keyboard is 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:45.260

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:48.410

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.940
 uncomfortable doing all this through some

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.110

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.090

 Touchpad Help with Mouse Cursor 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.030
 Well, now to describe a few numbers 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.640
 wireless range 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.950
 is about 10 meters 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.420
 The dimensions of this keyboard are 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.360
 two hundred fifty four millimeters 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:26.840
 width 6 millimeters thickness 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.670

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.460
 blister 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.350
 and there are just indicated the main gestures 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.130
 which can be used with 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.040
 touchpad 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.230
 click with one finger replaces mouse click 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.570
 two-finger click replaces the right 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.490
 mouse button and scrolling in two 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.300
 fingers this wheel respectively 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.640
 scroll 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.040
 while viewing photos for example 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.200
 if you move with just one finger 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.520
 this is a mouse cursor if you are not standing 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.070
 two fingers then 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.900
 turned over photos from this 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:00.620
 keyboard is also more simple 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.900
 version rap and 63 2 0 is practically 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.390
 same keyboard only without touchpad 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.790
 but she has one great thing in my opinion 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.280
 advantage is power from the embedded 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.800
 batteries and recharging with 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:16.340
 Usual cable cable heroes of today 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:19.130
 review rap e27 2 0 powered by two 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.140
 ordinary batteries keyboard keys 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.160
 built on scissor mechanisms 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.560
 switching 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.020
 some buttons due to compact 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.090
 device dimensions moved down 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:31.580
 the keyboard itself that in my opinion is not 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.910
 very convenient for example the same button x 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:36.860
 or ÑŠ moved to the very bottom therefore 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.080
 The layout of this model is not quite 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.180
 common but due to her little 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.310
 dimensions and basically get used 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.650
 can the keyboard itself not 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.320
 designed for fast typing 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.070
 and the very thing and the appointment for TVs on 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.130
 smart and 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:54.200
 already talking about this whole for those tasks 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:56.840
 for which I took it myself given 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.430
 the keyboard is great well and plus ko 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.700
 it's all compact enough 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.750
 keyboard is wireless enough 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.970
 pretty 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.070
 so what's important is with the built-in 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.620
 touchpad and all metal 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:11.780
 frame to see current prices on 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.060

 description but I have everything today 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.739
