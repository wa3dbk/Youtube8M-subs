00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:12.629 

you

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:12.639 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:14.940 

when<00:00:13.139> electricity<00:00:14.139> went<00:00:14.349> to<00:00:14.469> alternating

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:14.950 
when electricity went to alternating

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.650 
when electricity went to alternating
current<00:00:15.519> it<00:00:15.700> was<00:00:15.940> necessary<00:00:16.570> to<00:00:16.779> get<00:00:16.900> a

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
current it was necessary to get a

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.650 
current it was necessary to get a
differing<00:00:20.160> generator<00:00:21.160> than<00:00:21.610> was<00:00:21.910> necessary

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:22.660 
differing generator than was necessary

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.230 
differing generator than was necessary
in<00:00:22.869> the<00:00:23.020> in<00:00:23.860> the<00:00:24.160> early<00:00:24.220> direct<00:00:24.730> current<00:00:25.090> and

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:25.240 
in the in the early direct current and

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.019 
in the in the early direct current and
so<00:00:26.169> the<00:00:26.320> idea<00:00:26.619> of<00:00:26.680> driving<00:00:27.099> this<00:00:27.490> generator

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:28.029 
so the idea of driving this generator

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:30.150 
so the idea of driving this generator
with<00:00:28.300> a<00:00:28.330> steam<00:00:28.660> turbine<00:00:29.080> which<00:00:29.260> also<00:00:29.529> produced

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.160 
with a steam turbine which also produced

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.090 
with a steam turbine which also produced
more<00:00:30.340> power<00:00:30.670> as<00:00:31.000> well<00:00:31.240> as<00:00:31.390> higher<00:00:31.929> speed<00:00:32.439> was

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
more power as well as higher speed was

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.060 
more power as well as higher speed was
one<00:00:33.340> of<00:00:33.460> these<00:00:33.519> ideas<00:00:33.820> whose<00:00:34.269> time<00:00:34.570> had<00:00:34.839> come

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
one of these ideas whose time had come

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.090 
one of these ideas whose time had come
so<00:00:36.070> a<00:00:36.100> number<00:00:36.730> of<00:00:37.030> people<00:00:37.620> went<00:00:38.620> to<00:00:38.680> work<00:00:38.769> on

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.100 
so a number of people went to work on

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.530 
so a number of people went to work on
steam<00:00:39.370> turbines<00:00:39.670> now<00:00:39.699> steam<00:00:40.030> turbines<00:00:40.420> had

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540 
steam turbines now steam turbines had

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.030 
steam turbines now steam turbines had
been<00:00:40.690> worked<00:00:40.870> on<00:00:41.080> for<00:00:41.290> a<00:00:41.320> hundred<00:00:41.680> years<00:00:41.920> I

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:42.040 
been worked on for a hundred years I

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.740 
been worked on for a hundred years I
mean<00:00:42.160> almost<00:00:42.640> from<00:00:42.820> the<00:00:42.850> time<00:00:42.970> of<00:00:43.269> James<00:00:43.480> Watt

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
mean almost from the time of James Watt

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.720 
mean almost from the time of James Watt
people<00:00:44.140> realized<00:00:44.559> you<00:00:44.950> know<00:00:45.070> they<00:00:45.190> knew<00:00:45.579> about

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:45.730 
people realized you know they knew about

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.910 
people realized you know they knew about
water<00:00:46.120> wheels<00:00:46.390> and<00:00:46.660> turbines<00:00:47.020> so<00:00:47.530> it<00:00:47.620> was<00:00:47.800> an

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
water wheels and turbines so it was an

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.520 
water wheels and turbines so it was an
old<00:00:48.160> idea<00:00:48.640> and<00:00:48.940> many<00:00:49.390> people<00:00:49.899> working<00:00:50.199> on<00:00:50.500> it

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530 
old idea and many people working on it

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.729 
old idea and many people working on it
so<00:00:50.800> there<00:00:51.010> was<00:00:51.160> nothing<00:00:51.870> new<00:00:52.870> about<00:00:53.289> the<00:00:53.440> idea

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:53.739 
so there was nothing new about the idea

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:55.709 
so there was nothing new about the idea
what<00:00:54.070> the<00:00:54.370> question<00:00:54.760> was<00:00:54.910> how<00:00:55.149> could<00:00:55.390> you<00:00:55.539> make

00:00:55.709 --> 00:00:55.719 
what the question was how could you make

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:58.200 
what the question was how could you make
it<00:00:55.780> work<00:00:56.140> and<00:00:56.440> there<00:00:57.190> were<00:00:57.309> two<00:00:58.000> or<00:00:58.180> three

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
it work and there were two or three

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.750 
it work and there were two or three
basic<00:00:58.870> ways<00:00:59.050> to<00:00:59.350> make<00:00:59.500> it<00:00:59.530> work<00:00:59.890> and<00:01:00.070> as

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
basic ways to make it work and as

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.840 
basic ways to make it work and as
typical<00:01:01.420> and<00:01:01.570> invention<00:01:02.050> they<00:01:02.140> were<00:01:02.260> all

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
typical and invention they were all

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.790 
typical and invention they were all
applied<00:01:03.850> at<00:01:04.180> this<00:01:04.420> time<00:01:04.660> not<00:01:04.899> because<00:01:05.320> nobody

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:05.800 
applied at this time not because nobody

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.010 
applied at this time not because nobody
had<00:01:05.920> thought<00:01:06.100> of<00:01:06.220> these<00:01:06.340> ideas<00:01:06.759> before<00:01:07.020> but

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
had thought of these ideas before but

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.859 
had thought of these ideas before but
because<00:01:08.440> you<00:01:08.950> know<00:01:09.009> there<00:01:09.670> was<00:01:09.820> a<00:01:09.850> need<00:01:10.210> the

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:10.869 
because you know there was a need the

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:12.600 
because you know there was a need the
idea<00:01:11.200> of<00:01:11.289> necessity<00:01:11.800> the<00:01:11.830> mother<00:01:12.070> invention

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
idea of necessity the mother invention

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.010 
idea of necessity the mother invention
is<00:01:12.729> perhaps<00:01:13.119> not<00:01:13.300> the<00:01:13.420> whole<00:01:13.570> story<00:01:13.810> but<00:01:13.929> it

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
is perhaps not the whole story but it

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.969 
is perhaps not the whole story but it
certainly<00:01:14.110> was<00:01:14.350> the<00:01:14.410> story<00:01:14.619> in<00:01:14.710> this<00:01:14.830> case

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979 
certainly was the story in this case

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:16.969 
certainly was the story in this case
there<00:01:15.160> was<00:01:15.280> a<00:01:15.310> need<00:01:15.580> for<00:01:15.759> a<00:01:15.820> high<00:01:16.060> speed<00:01:16.450> and

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
there was a need for a high speed and

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.340 
there was a need for a high speed and
high<00:01:17.979> power<00:01:18.250> thing<00:01:18.850> so<00:01:19.060> there<00:01:19.990> was<00:01:20.110> a<00:01:20.140> man

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
high power thing so there was a man

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.020 
high power thing so there was a man
named<00:01:20.560> Parsons<00:01:21.100> in<00:01:21.189> England<00:01:21.490> who<00:01:21.580> I<00:01:21.640> think<00:01:21.880> was

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
named Parsons in England who I think was

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.940 
named Parsons in England who I think was
you<00:01:22.360> should<00:01:22.930> be<00:01:23.049> given<00:01:23.380> the<00:01:23.470> credit<00:01:23.619> not

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
you should be given the credit not

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.200 
you should be given the credit not
because<00:01:24.250> he<00:01:24.369> was<00:01:24.490> the<00:01:24.640> first<00:01:24.670> one<00:01:25.060> who<00:01:25.180> did

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
because he was the first one who did

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.300 
because he was the first one who did
this<00:01:25.509> but<00:01:26.170> he<00:01:26.430> really<00:01:27.430> pushed<00:01:27.820> this<00:01:28.000> idea<00:01:28.210> and

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
this but he really pushed this idea and

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.170 
this but he really pushed this idea and
conquered<00:01:30.310> a<00:01:30.369> lot<00:01:30.520> of<00:01:30.670> the<00:01:30.759> engineering

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
conquered a lot of the engineering

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.510 
conquered a lot of the engineering
difficulties<00:01:31.689> and<00:01:32.110> pretty<00:01:32.619> much<00:01:32.860> got<00:01:33.340> out

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
difficulties and pretty much got out

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.300 
difficulties and pretty much got out

who<00:01:45.850> were<00:01:45.970> doing<00:01:46.240> this<00:01:46.390> and<00:01:46.570> no<00:01:46.689> doubt<00:01:46.899> many

other people in other countries that I

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.080 
other people in other countries that I
don't<00:01:49.030> even<00:01:49.119> know<00:01:49.390> about<00:01:49.560> he<00:01:50.560> looked<00:01:51.460> at<00:01:51.640> this

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
don't even know about he looked at this

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.240 
don't even know about he looked at this
question<00:01:52.630> and<00:01:52.780> and<00:01:53.020> picked<00:01:53.409> one<00:01:53.770> of<00:01:53.920> the<00:01:54.070> two

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
question and and picked one of the two

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.190 
question and and picked one of the two
or<00:01:54.399> three<00:01:54.579> basic<00:01:55.060> ways<00:01:55.240> of<00:01:55.479> doing<00:01:55.689> it<00:01:55.960> and<00:01:56.079> I

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
or three basic ways of doing it and I

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.899 
or three basic ways of doing it and I
really<00:01:56.920> don't<00:01:57.100> understand<00:01:57.640> the<00:01:57.759> technology

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
really don't understand the technology

00:01:57.909 --> 00:01:59.999 
really don't understand the technology
that<00:01:58.540> well<00:01:58.719> but<00:01:58.899> he<00:01:59.049> picked<00:01:59.290> a<00:01:59.409> different<00:01:59.799> way

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:02.069 
that well but he picked a different way
of<00:02:00.040> Parsons<00:02:00.700> it<00:02:00.820> has<00:02:01.000> to<00:02:01.180> do<00:02:01.329> with<00:02:01.479> how<00:02:01.630> you<00:02:01.689> how

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:02.079 
of Parsons it has to do with how you how

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:03.899 
of Parsons it has to do with how you how
the<00:02:02.140> steam<00:02:02.560> expands<00:02:03.189> in<00:02:03.310> the<00:02:03.399> turbine<00:02:03.700> and

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
the steam expands in the turbine and

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:05.910 
the steam expands in the turbine and
whether<00:02:04.509> you<00:02:04.719> use<00:02:04.750> the<00:02:05.170> blades<00:02:05.380> to<00:02:05.530> determine

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
whether you use the blades to determine

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.100 
whether you use the blades to determine
like<00:02:06.070> like<00:02:06.460> an<00:02:06.610> airplane<00:02:06.969> wing<00:02:07.390> or<00:02:07.659> whether

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
like like an airplane wing or whether

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.680 
like like an airplane wing or whether
you<00:02:08.289> use<00:02:08.350> it<00:02:08.709> more<00:02:08.920> like<00:02:09.100> a<00:02:09.459> something<00:02:10.420> like<00:02:10.570> a

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
you use it more like a something like a

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.979 
you use it more like a something like a
water<00:02:10.989> wheel<00:02:11.230> with<00:02:11.709> the<00:02:12.040> same<00:02:13.030> impacts<00:02:13.510> and<00:02:13.810> so

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
water wheel with the same impacts and so

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:16.800 
water wheel with the same impacts and so
he<00:02:14.620> picked<00:02:14.950> a<00:02:15.190> different<00:02:15.820> route<00:02:16.030> than<00:02:16.060> Parsons

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
he picked a different route than Parsons

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.069 
he picked a different route than Parsons
again<00:02:17.200> with<00:02:17.380> his<00:02:17.530> patents<00:02:17.980> knowledge

well<00:02:23.410> this<00:02:23.919> I've<00:02:24.760> read<00:02:25.150> some<00:02:25.389> of<00:02:25.419> the<00:02:25.630> reports

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
well this I've read some of the reports

well this I've read some of the reports

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
read the reports that rice made going

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.699 
read the reports that rice made going
down<00:02:29.769> to<00:02:30.010> view<00:02:30.220> this<00:02:30.400> and<00:02:30.820> again<00:02:31.600> it<00:02:32.169> wasn't<00:02:32.650> a

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
down to view this and again it wasn't a

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.680 
down to view this and again it wasn't a
question<00:02:32.919> of<00:02:33.220> discovering<00:02:34.000> something<00:02:34.389> out<00:02:34.660> of

question of discovering something out of

question of discovering something out of

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
particular approach would be better than

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.550 
particular approach would be better than
Parsons<00:02:43.299> which<00:02:43.480> was<00:02:43.660> out<00:02:43.840> ahead<00:02:44.079> of<00:02:44.230> the<00:02:44.320> pack

Parsons which was out ahead of the pack

Parsons which was out ahead of the pack
in<00:02:45.370> spite<00:02:46.180> of<00:02:46.209> their<00:02:46.600> doubt<00:02:47.310> and<00:02:48.310> partly

in spite of their doubt and partly

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.729 
in spite of their doubt and partly

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:14.919 
that was what was happening with these

that was what was happening with these
turbines<00:03:15.370> the<00:03:15.489> turbine<00:03:15.850> was<00:03:15.970> extremely

difficult as an engineering challenge
and<00:03:18.790> one<00:03:19.419> I<00:03:19.449> think<00:03:19.630> where<00:03:20.470> rice<00:03:20.889> and<00:03:21.220> others

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
and one I think where rice and others

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.729 
and one I think where rice and others
particularly<00:03:22.570> someone<00:03:22.930> like<00:03:23.139> rice<00:03:23.350> should<00:03:23.590> be

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
particularly someone like rice should be

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:25.770 
particularly someone like rice should be

where I am it to work with Curtis on
this<00:03:31.150> and<00:03:31.389> to<00:03:31.600> pull<00:03:31.810> it<00:03:31.959> through<00:03:32.199> so<00:03:33.010> I<00:03:33.040> would

this and to pull it through so I would

this and to pull it through so I would

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
say it was not a question of a great new

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.860 
say it was not a question of a great new
idea<00:03:36.459> it<00:03:37.180> was<00:03:37.449> not<00:03:37.660> even<00:03:38.049> a<00:03:38.139> question<00:03:38.350> of

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
idea it was not even a question of

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.800 
idea it was not even a question of
Curtis<00:03:40.870> being<00:03:41.340> someone<00:03:42.340> who<00:03:42.519> was<00:03:42.850> so<00:03:43.299> doubtful

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
Curtis being someone who was so doubtful

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.360 
Curtis being someone who was so doubtful
that<00:03:43.989> it<00:03:44.079> took<00:03:44.229> a<00:03:44.290> tremendous<00:03:44.709> amount<00:03:45.250> of

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
that it took a tremendous amount of

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.819 
that it took a tremendous amount of
genius<00:03:45.790> that<00:03:45.970> to<00:03:46.329> recognize<00:03:46.900> what<00:03:47.560> he<00:03:47.590> was

genius that to recognize what he was

genius that to recognize what he was
doing<00:03:48.070> but<00:03:48.609> this<00:03:48.820> idea<00:03:49.090> of<00:03:49.419> sticking<00:03:49.930> with<00:03:50.169> it

doing but this idea of sticking with it

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
over a long period of time was what I

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.629 
over a long period of time was what I
think<00:03:52.959> rice<00:03:53.320> and<00:03:53.620> others<00:03:53.829> and<00:03:54.010> GE<00:03:54.160> should<00:03:54.489> be

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:54.639 
think rice and others and GE should be

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:57.000 
think rice and others and GE should be
credit<00:03:55.030> for<00:03:55.239> now<00:03:55.720> one<00:03:56.350> would<00:03:56.530> take<00:03:56.680> away<00:03:56.979> a

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
credit for now one would take away a

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.620 
credit for now one would take away a
little<00:03:57.220> bit<00:03:57.310> of<00:03:57.459> the<00:03:57.609> credit<00:03:57.910> because<00:03:58.060> it<00:03:58.479> was

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
little bit of the credit because it was

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.229 
little bit of the credit because it was
necessary<00:03:58.870> for<00:03:59.440> them<00:03:59.560> to<00:03:59.709> do<00:03:59.859> this

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
necessary for them to do this

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.789 
necessary for them to do this
Westinghouse<00:04:01.239> had<00:04:01.479> negotiated<00:04:01.989> with<00:04:02.260> Parsons

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
Westinghouse had negotiated with Parsons

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:04.319 
Westinghouse had negotiated with Parsons
to<00:04:02.949> get<00:04:03.100> his<00:04:03.280> turbine<00:04:03.669> it<00:04:03.760> was<00:04:03.880> clear<00:04:04.150> that

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:04.329 
to get his turbine it was clear that

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:06.030 
to get his turbine it was clear that
turbine<00:04:04.600> were<00:04:04.720> coming<00:04:05.019> and<00:04:05.169> so<00:04:05.259> GE<00:04:05.500> had<00:04:05.739> to<00:04:05.889> get

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
turbine were coming and so GE had to get

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.759 
turbine were coming and so GE had to get
a<00:04:06.070> turbine<00:04:06.459> somewhere<00:04:06.880> so<00:04:07.630> I<00:04:08.019> would<00:04:08.590> say<00:04:08.709> it

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
a turbine somewhere so I would say it

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:10.920 
a turbine somewhere so I would say it
was<00:04:08.829> more<00:04:09.040> casar<00:04:09.340> than<00:04:09.609> picking<00:04:09.850> a<00:04:10.090> Curtiss<00:04:10.780> as

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
was more casar than picking a Curtiss as

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.810 
was more casar than picking a Curtiss as
the<00:04:11.109> one<00:04:11.320> which<00:04:11.590> had<00:04:11.739> the<00:04:11.889> best<00:04:12.100> combination

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:12.820 
the one which had the best combination

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.060 
the one which had the best combination
of<00:04:13.000> succeeding<00:04:13.750> and<00:04:14.139> giving<00:04:14.859> them<00:04:15.040> a

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.070 
of succeeding and giving them a

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:17.759 
of succeeding and giving them a
proprietary<00:04:15.790> position<00:04:16.389> that<00:04:17.049> they<00:04:17.259> could<00:04:17.500> use

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
proprietary position that they could use

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.219 
proprietary position that they could use
in<00:04:18.040> in<00:04:18.519> contests<00:04:19.209> with<00:04:19.419> Westinghouse<00:04:19.870> and

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:20.229 
in in contests with Westinghouse and

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:22.560 
in in contests with Westinghouse and
other<00:04:20.350> rivals<00:04:20.859> so<00:04:21.040> I<00:04:21.360> apologized<00:04:22.360> for<00:04:22.419> making

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
other rivals so I apologized for making

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.060 
other rivals so I apologized for making
it<00:04:22.810> sound<00:04:22.960> complicated<00:04:23.199> but<00:04:23.830> wasn't

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070
