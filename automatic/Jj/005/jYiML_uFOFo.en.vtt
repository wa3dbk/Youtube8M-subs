00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
you don't know which coil is so they

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.910 
you don't know which coil is so they
just<00:02:47.420> have<00:02:47.600> to<00:02:47.860> try<00:02:48.860> them<00:02:48.980> all<00:02:49.130> up<00:02:49.280> and<00:02:50.769> we<00:02:51.769> ask

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
just have to try them all up and we ask

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.250 
just have to try them all up and we ask
the<00:02:52.070> real<00:02:52.250> just<00:02:52.519> transfer<00:02:53.330> each<00:02:53.600> of<00:02:53.780> the<00:02:53.900> crate

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
the real just transfer each of the crate

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.820 
the real just transfer each of the crate
into<00:02:55.160> the<00:02:55.760> marker<00:02:56.230> so<00:02:57.230> it<00:02:57.440> would<00:02:57.560> trigger<00:02:57.709> the

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
into the marker so it would trigger the

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.920 
into the marker so it would trigger the
cutscene<00:02:58.310> where<00:02:58.459> Caesar<00:02:59.030> would<00:02:59.300> open<00:02:59.720> it<00:02:59.810> up

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
cutscene where Caesar would open it up

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.570 
cutscene where Caesar would open it up
to<00:03:00.170> see<00:03:00.830> which<00:03:00.980> car<00:03:01.190> it<00:03:01.340> is<00:03:03.070> so<00:03:04.070> just<00:03:04.370> make<00:03:04.549> sure

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
to see which car it is so just make sure

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.030

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
it gets close to the ground or possible

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.759 
it gets close to the ground or possible
on<00:03:07.250> the<00:03:07.400> ground<00:03:07.610> is<00:03:07.820> one<00:03:08.120> CD<00:03:08.630> before<00:03:09.260> you<00:03:09.590> press

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769

the<00:03:20.870> one<00:03:21.940> so<00:03:22.940> I<00:03:22.970> have<00:03:23.180> to<00:03:23.299> go<00:03:23.420> back<00:03:23.450> and<00:03:23.959> click

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
the one so I have to go back and click

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.880 
the one so I have to go back and click
this<00:03:24.830> one<00:03:25.120> now<00:03:26.120> as<00:03:26.660> far<00:03:26.930> as<00:03:26.989> I'm<00:03:27.170> concerned<00:03:27.200> I

think<00:03:28.850> it's<00:03:29.000> just<00:03:29.209> that<00:03:29.420> you'll<00:03:30.049> have<00:03:30.290> to<00:03:30.410> get

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
think it's just that you'll have to get

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.920 
think it's just that you'll have to get
all<00:03:30.799> 3<00:03:31.010> crates<00:03:31.220> onto<00:03:31.549> the<00:03:31.760> ground<00:03:31.970> before<00:03:32.690> you

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
all 3 crates onto the ground before you

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.370 
all 3 crates onto the ground before you
get<00:03:33.110> the<00:03:33.170> right<00:03:33.350> one

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
get the right one

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.370 
get the right one
