00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:07.620
 in this video we're going to see how it 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:11.100
 converts a fraction into a mixed number and 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.560
 a mixed number in fraction let's see 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.990
 first of all how is it passed from fraction 

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:20.070
 a mixed number 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.360
 we go with the fraction ten quarters ten 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.810
 four I have it represented 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:27.689
 graphically we remember in the video 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.099
 earlier that we had talked about about 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.509
 biscuits that are divided into four 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.420
 equal parts, well, here we have 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:36.480
 biscuits biscuits a sponge cake 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.280
 two biscuits three biscuits divided 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.739
 in four equal parts in four 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.269
 portions each cake according to 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.489
 this fraction two quarters 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:49.199
 I have represented therefore both here the 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:53.909
 ten portions one two three four five 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:56.879
 six seven eight nine and ten portions 

00:00:53.909 --> 00:01:00.930
 the ten portions of agreement ten 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.850
 rooms now to pass this fraction to 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.519
 Mixed number what we do is divide 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:09.119
 ten between four is to say the numerator 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.130
 between the 2 between the denominator this 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.250
 division that is very simple the quotient 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.470
 is 2 and the rest also 2 we will see 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.450
 what each of us wants to say 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.979
 these terms the quotient and the rest the 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.530
 quotient what the 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.600
 quotient 2 is that I have 2 sponge cake 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.670
 complete of the 10 portions that I 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.960
 I have to divide it by 4 what I am 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.850
 doing is to group the four in 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.950
 four so what I'm forming 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.979
 they are full cakes and I get that 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.040
 I have two full cakes and the rest 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:41.190
 what is telling me is that I have 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.340
 There are two pieces of agreement left over 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:47.490
 both the mixed number formed will be the 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.710
 next 2 of the quotient is to say the 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.810
 complete cupcakes will be the number 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:57.509
 natural of the mixed number 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:02:00.090
 and the 2 of the rest will be the numerator of the 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:04.649
 fraction of agreement that is me 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:07.530
 indicating that I have two portions of 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.720
 four in which I have divided that a 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.950
 biscuit agree therefore the number 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.000
 mixed be two 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.100
 two rooms 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.580
 let's see now how it happens 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:23.000
 from mixed number to fraction following with 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.950
 the previous example also agree 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.830
 it's the same example but now we're going to 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:32.970
 see the inverse I have the number 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:34.650
 mixed two two quarters and to pass it to 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.530
 fraction the first thing we do is 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.300
 multiply the natural number 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.860
 by four is to say what I am 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.080
 doing is multiply the two 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.180
 biscuits that I have for four portions 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.240
 in which four are divided each 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:51.900
 cake so two for four I 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:55.560
 says that I have eight portions between 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.780
 two full cakes I have more the 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.230
 2 of the numerator 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.690
 of the fraction that make a total of 10 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.210
 lots of agreement 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.640
 therefore the fraction that corresponds 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:11.550
 with that number of ministers will be 10 that 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.310
 they are the portions that there are in total 10 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.440
 fourths and 4 because it is the number of 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.790
 equal parts or portions in which 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.790
 I divide every time
