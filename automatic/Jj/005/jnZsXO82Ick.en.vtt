00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.399
 there is everybody getting angry then 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:03.840
 today we find myself for my 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:04.920
 second video in the shot tutorial 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.059
 franc that I had announced in my decision 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.860
 of small auditory introduction 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.080
 and I do not put all the free kicks 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.440
 to explain something to you 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.670
 I am not very trs I have not found 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.390
 on the computer we will not have any 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.010
 interactive way 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.960
 on the other hand after steve a reindeer jewel 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.330
 but will follow that will indicate what I 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.699
 would like to say she will talk to you about it side 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.760
 will be the real- time logic will be 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:33.860
 fully subscribed described to the audio 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.700
 so I hope you will understand 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.500
 personally the people of my team and 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.690
 I have my pro turn told me that they 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.000
 put all their free kick so I 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.160
 think that's enough so that's the joystick 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.930
 when i would already say stick down 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.110
 it will be like the left diagonal arrow 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.660
 it will be like like it's on the 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.860
 joystick left fully it will be 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.449
 like that and at the bottom left you come 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.520
 to see we will start with the first 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.550
 part and you free-kick runs that 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.809
 I will call for the first tutorial 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.329
 the first free kick 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.570
 it will be a free kick at 22 meters or game 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.520
 to circumvent the wall we must aim to 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.869
 about as if there were players 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.100
 in addition in the mayor or life would be the 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.720
 second player you put a little less 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.030
 of two bars such a joystick in 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.130
 diagonal left up 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.930
 the powerful free kick from the left side to 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.460
 21 m free-kick since it does not care 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.920
 simply empty and left joystick 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.810
 up the bar masters or a 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.360
 little less is the current that make 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.560
 most often and most easily the 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.799
 name a free kick 25 meters to the right 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.329
 always have the same thing two bars 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:34.950
 at the mall of 6 up and it comes in 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.909
 you see powerful guardian fold the 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.579
 touch or but let him pass 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:41.359
 a free kick 20 meters to the right so 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:43.460
 still the same thing 

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:45.619
 the powerful effect the effect that the 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.140
 extras most often two bars on 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:50.619
 mix I'm up and it comes in 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.310
 barras very easily 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:53.200
 now I'm going to do the same thing 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.289
 on the left 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:59.859
 and this free kick there I advise you 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:02.030
 to use 28 meters maximum 

00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:03.770
 do not take people who have a big swing 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.750
 since they have poor quality 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.119
 when it's like that when 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.540
 it's hard in finesse we will work around the 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.069
 wall at 20 meters so when it's on the side 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.500
 left and aim for the last defender 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.180
 you put a little less bearded like 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.579
 she cycle up left and no 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.190
 not at the top of it all and this has me a 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:24.200
 dupont effect passes the goalkeeper enough 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.610
 easily as well as the wall this is a 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.750
 free kick that returned often if you 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.440
 do not want to take your head 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:33.799
 you do aimed at the most 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:36.170
 close where there's no wall you put 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:38.299
 two bars a little more than bars 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.720
 forward and let it sank 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:42.709
 his return very easily 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.239
 now free kick is stylish 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.980
 if you know that your opponent 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:49.250
 know well I who jumps on free kick 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:52.010
 you put a bar or a tiny 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.380
 little more she squeezed joystick towards the 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.579
 high and it goes in light title 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.000
 I think it's a very free kick 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:03:02.470
 very very classy but it is surely the 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.250
 more complicated to come back from this tutorial 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.260
 now we will go to the franc 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.150
 special and far off I apologize for having 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.639
 not been portrayed having been growing with 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.230
 the image so to shift the balloon 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:14.000
 it's simple you do l2 to do 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.280
 come the second player yes it's l2 in 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.739
 French and cross and you hit everything 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.819
 what is second player actually if you 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:20.630
 want to do an action with the guy 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:22.010
 who comes with the key is a 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.540
 forger in French with the guy 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.849
 who sell the key l2 times cl of water 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.980
 deep down so that's where I'm going to come from 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:30.079
 remember higuain so and l2 key 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.690
 I leave to him two children threw himself 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:33.769
 square like that a year ball stung you 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.150
 can send it further according to the 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:36.410
 distance that without the power that you 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.660
 put and I retaliate that we have 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.319
 others in tilman there I did a 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.010
 double fault 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:43.799
 so that's without calling you players 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.720
 12 and rhin to float the 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:49.590
 good man to let you sink 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.909
 do we believe what will do that will launch 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.640
 the race and when money king he will cancel 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:55.500
 and bets for the player on the left 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.640
 especially wanted that of children this is the 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.099
 free kick which is the biggest is done 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.239
 so you have to put yourself not just 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:02.099
 hit the key the quickest 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.269
 possible for it to take me the least 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:03.829
 of power and such a gesture in 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.940
 lower left 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:07.890
 sam is a huge effect against the 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.079
 males showed up very quickly so I 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.040
 world just like that for you to be at 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:14.790
 current of all free kicks 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.889
 possible but try not too much 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.209
 use what theirs to bonnac he 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:20.070
 just have to have ronaldo or 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:23.130
 ronaldinho a sum ronaldinho can the 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.389
 do you aim to the maximum left and 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:28.460
 you do the same thing for the shot 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:30.000
 franc very big effect how do you say 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.290
 you 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.050
 you just type a little bit on the 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:35.580
 square key the ag bypasses the wall at 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.380
 long distance so I drew a little bit 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.040
 close as I walked around the wall at 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.590
 short distance 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.450
 I put a little more in a little 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.920
 less than three bars upstairs at 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.930
 left there it's the same thing except that 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:48.060
 I pass over the wall you put 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.070
 three boats joystick up 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.500
 it's a really extraordinary goal 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:55.050
 I find super nice but very complicated 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.330
 ahmed me i find i'm going to make a game 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.580
 you put two free kicks in a row 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:02.400
 so no matter the end distance 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:04.830
 try to do it between 36 have tried 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.150
 to do it but only 2 36 m but 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.710
 it teaches that he came home very often 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.940
 down there you saw him there I just did 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.860
 shoot both shoots had put them 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.600
 so I took them you aim a little 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.000
 little on the mayor's side so the last 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.550
 player to the right and you put your 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.230
 joystick at the top left as much you 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.600
 enjoyed your typing some more 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:25.130
 two bars it was the shot tutorial 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:28.350
 Frank I hope he would have helped you 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:29.910
 how to say if you liked it I you 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:31.260
 leaves it badly managed by comments if you 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.090
 find something missing 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:37.620
 I also let you tell me by 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:39.330
 trading commentary c 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.250
 it was I hope you will have liked like 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:42.479
 I said and then you end the 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.340
 next video the next video that 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:47.210
 will surely be the video presentation 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:50.669
 personal presentation of my bio 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:51.840
 or surely a call of life gameplay 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:53.669
 why not but I think will be rather 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.389
 the video presentation left a 

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:56.389
 extreme guys
