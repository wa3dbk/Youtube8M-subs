it in my opinion at you know he got

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.610 
it in my opinion at you know he got
court<00:04:31.070> against<00:04:31.580> I<00:04:32.080> forget<00:04:33.080> his<00:04:33.200> last<00:04:33.410> opponent

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620

caught he actually went town in the
eighth<00:04:38.420> I<00:04:38.630> think<00:04:38.810> because<00:04:39.560> he<00:04:39.800> was<00:04:39.980> not<00:04:40.190> you

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
eighth I think because he was not you

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.120 
eighth I think because he was not you
know<00:04:40.490> he<00:04:40.670> keeps<00:04:40.850> his<00:04:41.030> hands<00:04:41.180> low<00:04:41.740> he's<00:04:42.740> not<00:04:42.890> got

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.130 
know he keeps his hands low he's not got

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.520 
know he keeps his hands low he's not got
the<00:04:43.160> best<00:04:43.550> defense<00:04:43.970> just<00:04:44.870> keep<00:04:45.050> his<00:04:45.140> hands<00:04:45.290> low

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
the best defense just keep his hands low

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:46.900 
the best defense just keep his hands low
because<00:04:45.860> he's<00:04:46.070> not<00:04:46.220> he's<00:04:46.370> lonely<00:04:46.580> on<00:04:46.820> the

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
because he's not he's lonely on the

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.020 
because he's not he's lonely on the
