00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
to the north and what we are getting

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.880 
to the north and what we are getting
we're<00:01:33.659> getting<00:01:33.869> reports<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.409> tornado<00:01:34.740> with

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
we're getting reports of a tornado with

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.280 
we're getting reports of a tornado with
this<00:01:34.950> but<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.970> me<00:01:36.119> what<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:36.540> looks<00:01:36.720> like<00:01:36.900> is<00:01:37.170> we

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
this but to me what it looks like is we

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.499 
this but to me what it looks like is we
have<00:01:37.590> something<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.310> that<00:01:38.759> cloud<00:01:39.060> looks<00:01:39.390> a

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
have something that that cloud looks a

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:40.999 
have something that that cloud looks a
little<00:01:39.600> bit<00:01:39.840> more<00:01:40.020> like<00:01:40.170> a<00:01:40.200> shelf<00:01:40.530> cloud<00:01:40.710> you

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
little bit more like a shelf cloud you

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.679 
little bit more like a shelf cloud you
see<00:01:41.159> that's<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.520> little<00:01:41.939> bit<00:01:42.060> of<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.240> backwards

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
see that's a little bit of a backwards

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.139 
see that's a little bit of a backwards
see<00:01:42.899> shape<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.439> it<00:01:43.470> so<00:01:44.460> I<00:01:44.490> think<00:01:44.579> we're<00:01:44.939> getting

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
see shape to it so I think we're getting

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.990 
see shape to it so I think we're getting
some<00:01:45.329> pretty<00:01:45.479> strong<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:45.899> gust<00:01:46.530> front<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.070> that

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
some pretty strong a gust front and that

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.149 
some pretty strong a gust front and that
is<00:01:48.060> pushing<00:01:48.810> East<00:01:49.049> so<00:01:49.350> hopefully<00:01:49.740> this<00:01:49.920> is<00:01:49.950> a

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
is pushing East so hopefully this is a

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.980 
is pushing East so hopefully this is a
rear<00:01:50.700> flank<00:01:50.939> downdraft<00:01:51.000> that<00:01:51.630> is<00:01:51.720> going<00:01:51.869> to

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
rear flank downdraft that is going to

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.710 
rear flank downdraft that is going to
choke<00:01:52.229> off<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.649> tornado<00:01:52.950> possibility<00:01:53.720> that

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
choke off the tornado possibility that

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.270 
choke off the tornado possibility that
said<00:01:55.079> we're<00:01:55.290> getting<00:01:55.560> reports<00:01:55.979> that<00:01:56.070> there

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
said we're getting reports that there

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.880 
said we're getting reports that there
has<00:01:56.729> been<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:57.090> tornado<00:01:57.479> in<00:01:57.869> this<00:01:58.079> area<00:01:58.380> my<00:01:58.649> guess

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
has been a tornado in this area my guess

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.889 
has been a tornado in this area my guess
is<00:01:59.100> that<00:01:59.310> if<00:01:59.520> there<00:02:00.000> has<00:02:00.119> been<00:02:00.149> it<00:02:00.570> may<00:02:00.719> have

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
is that if there has been it may have

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.380 
is that if there has been it may have
been<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.110> fairly<00:02:01.590> short<00:02:01.920> brief<00:02:02.310> one<00:02:02.490> because

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
been a fairly short brief one because

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.560 
been a fairly short brief one because
we're<00:02:03.600> not<00:02:03.810> getting<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.290> very<00:02:04.469> intense

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
we're not getting the very intense

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.389 
we're not getting the very intense
rotation<00:02:06.570> showing<00:02:06.930> up<00:02:07.079> we're<00:02:07.290> seeing<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:07.740> more

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
rotation showing up we're seeing a more

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.510 
rotation showing up we're seeing a more
of<00:02:08.550> a<00:02:08.670> broad<00:02:09.179> red<00:02:09.660> flow<00:02:09.989> coming<00:02:10.289> in<00:02:10.470> here

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
of a broad red flow coming in here

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.760 
of a broad red flow coming in here
and<00:02:11.730> more<00:02:12.030> of<00:02:12.150> a<00:02:12.300> green<00:02:12.960> flow<00:02:13.230> that's<00:02:13.470> coming

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
and more of a green flow that's coming

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.220 
and more of a green flow that's coming
up<00:02:13.860> like<00:02:14.100> that<00:02:14.340> but<00:02:14.610> that<00:02:15.090> said<00:02:15.480> there<00:02:15.930> could

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
up like that but that said there could

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.620 
up like that but that said there could
be<00:02:16.260> a<00:02:16.440> tornado<00:02:17.430> hiding<00:02:18.000> in<00:02:18.180> one<00:02:18.420> or<00:02:18.570> more

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
be a tornado hiding in one or more

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.510 
be a tornado hiding in one or more
locations<00:02:19.110> there<00:02:19.530> right<00:02:19.980> if<00:02:20.100> you<00:02:20.160> mentioned

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
locations there right if you mentioned

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.950 
locations there right if you mentioned
perhaps<00:02:20.670> some<00:02:20.970> of<00:02:21.060> that<00:02:21.180> rear<00:02:21.630> flank

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
perhaps some of that rear flank

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.290 
perhaps some of that rear flank
downdraft<00:02:22.050> for<00:02:23.040> cooler<00:02:23.310> air<00:02:23.490> perhaps

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
downdraft for cooler air perhaps

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.120 
downdraft for cooler air perhaps
beginning<00:02:24.690> to<00:02:24.960> work<00:02:25.500> its<00:02:25.680> way<00:02:25.770> into<00:02:26.040> that

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
beginning to work its way into that

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.580 
beginning to work its way into that
circulation<00:02:26.910> and<00:02:27.060> and<00:02:27.320> hopefully<00:02:28.320> for<00:02:28.500> the

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
circulation and and hopefully for the

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.550 
circulation and and hopefully for the
people<00:02:28.860> of<00:02:28.980> Louisville<00:02:29.610> begin<00:02:30.180> to<00:02:30.450> end<00:02:30.990> that

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
people of Louisville begin to end that

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.070 
people of Louisville begin to end that
threat<00:02:31.860> and<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.790> right<00:02:33.060> up<00:02:33.300> there<00:02:33.600> right<00:02:33.930> at

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
threat and the right up there right at

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.570 
threat and the right up there right at
the<00:02:34.170> northern<00:02:34.470> edge<00:02:34.620> of<00:02:34.800> this<00:02:34.890> weak<00:02:35.190> inflow

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
the northern edge of this weak inflow

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.450 
the northern edge of this weak inflow
region<00:02:35.790> knotch<00:02:36.270> there<00:02:36.840> is<00:02:37.020> one<00:02:37.350> speck<00:02:37.890> just

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
region knotch there is one speck just

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.700 
region knotch there is one speck just
one<00:02:38.640> little<00:02:38.910> pixel<00:02:39.300> of<00:02:39.570> tornado<00:02:40.200> debris<00:02:40.500> a

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
one little pixel of tornado debris a

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.610 
one little pixel of tornado debris a
signature<00:02:41.370> so<00:02:41.790> if<00:02:42.060> it<00:02:42.810> is<00:02:42.960> possible<00:02:43.050> that

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
signature so if it is possible that

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.980 
signature so if it is possible that
there<00:02:43.710> could<00:02:43.770> be<00:02:43.920> a<00:02:44.010> tornado<00:02:44.400> there<00:02:45.000> or<00:02:45.330> brief

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
there could be a tornado there or brief

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.750 
there could be a tornado there or brief
tornadoes<00:02:46.410> in<00:02:46.620> a<00:02:46.710> number<00:02:46.950> of<00:02:46.980> locations<00:02:47.160> there

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
tornadoes in a number of locations there

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.880 
tornadoes in a number of locations there
this<00:02:48.240> one<00:02:48.480> is<00:02:48.510> much<00:02:48.810> harder<00:02:49.110> to<00:02:49.290> pinpoint<00:02:49.500> the

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
this one is much harder to pinpoint the

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.070 
this one is much harder to pinpoint the
location<00:02:49.920> than<00:02:50.880> the<00:02:50.910> previous<00:02:51.540> of<00:02:51.720> a<00:02:51.780> storm

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
that had such a well-defined debris ball

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.970

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
and tornado signature this one could be

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.610 
and tornado signature this one could be
a<00:02:56.370> brief<00:02:56.850> tornado<00:02:57.120> that<00:02:57.450> will<00:02:57.630> form<00:02:58.050> anywhere

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
if not a tornado you are definitely

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.590 
if not a tornado you are definitely
looking<00:03:14.400> at<00:03:14.640> in<00:03:14.790> an<00:03:14.910> area<00:03:15.180> where<00:03:15.330> there<00:03:15.480> is

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
looking at in an area where there is

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.390 
looking at in an area where there is

debris<00:03:21.150> apart<00:03:21.540> so<00:03:21.810> flying<00:03:22.410> debris<00:03:22.680> that's<00:03:22.980> why

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
debris apart so flying debris that's why

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.620 
debris apart so flying debris that's why
we<00:03:23.460> like<00:03:23.640> you<00:03:23.670> to<00:03:23.820> be<00:03:23.880> in<00:03:24.060> an<00:03:24.180> underground

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
we like you to be in an underground

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.380 
we like you to be in an underground
storm<00:03:25.020> shelter<00:03:25.910> because<00:03:26.910> of<00:03:27.060> the<00:03:27.120> flying

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
storm shelter because of the flying

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.330 
storm shelter because of the flying
debris<00:03:27.600> can<00:03:28.110> prove<00:03:28.410> fatal<00:03:28.770> as<00:03:29.010> though<00:03:29.160> you

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
debris can prove fatal as though you

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.490 
debris can prove fatal as though you
know<00:03:29.490> somebody<00:03:29.910> out<00:03:29.970> there<00:03:30.300> looking<00:03:30.870> at<00:03:31.080> what

looking at pieces of wood perhaps
exposed<00:04:08.130> nails<00:04:08.400> and<00:04:08.670> that's<00:04:08.790> not<00:04:09.000> what<00:04:09.180> you

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.270 
exposed nails and that's not what you

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:10.430 
exposed nails and that's not what you

winds right now that's certainly the

and<00:05:11.100> the<00:05:11.460> tornado<00:05:11.760> liking<00:05:12.270> to<00:05:12.389> sit<00:05:12.630> there

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
and the tornado liking to sit there

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.100 
and the tornado liking to sit there
right<00:05:13.410> where<00:05:13.590> the<00:05:14.000> cold<00:05:15.000> outflow<00:05:15.600> air<00:05:15.840> and<00:05:16.050> the

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
right where the cold outflow air and the

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.320 
right where the cold outflow air and the
warm<00:05:16.289> inflow<00:05:16.710> air<00:05:16.860> collide<00:05:17.310> and<00:05:17.580> clash<00:05:17.850> let's

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
warm inflow air collide and clash let's

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.290 
warm inflow air collide and clash let's
see<00:05:18.479> the<00:05:18.600> velocities<00:05:19.080> on<00:05:19.229> this<00:05:19.440> one<00:05:19.620> and<00:05:20.550> there

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
see the velocities on this one and there

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.240 
see the velocities on this one and there
well<00:05:22.139> it's<00:05:22.470> actually<00:05:22.590> still<00:05:23.039> two

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
well it's actually still two

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.100 
well it's actually still two
circulations<00:05:23.940> we<00:05:24.090> still<00:05:24.360> have<00:05:24.539> a<00:05:24.570> little<00:05:24.810> bit

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
circulations we still have a little bit

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.200 
circulations we still have a little bit
of<00:05:25.139> a<00:05:25.320> signature<00:05:25.650> of<00:05:25.889> the<00:05:26.010> first<00:05:26.250> storm<00:05:26.639> while

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
of a signature of the first storm while

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:28.760 
of a signature of the first storm while
the<00:05:27.389> next<00:05:27.600> storm<00:05:27.840> is<00:05:27.990> gaining<00:05:28.260> on<00:05:28.470> it<00:05:28.620> they're

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
the next storm is gaining on it they're

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.770 
the next storm is gaining on it they're
merging<00:05:29.039> and<00:05:29.370> so<00:05:29.940> this<00:05:30.150> could<00:05:30.360> be<00:05:30.389> a<00:05:30.510> place

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:30.780 
merging and so this could be a place

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.590 
merging and so this could be a place
where<00:05:31.080> if<00:05:31.770> you<00:05:32.010> were<00:05:32.130> able<00:05:32.370> to<00:05:32.490> see<00:05:32.789> from<00:05:33.450> the

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 
where if you were able to see from the

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.270 
where if you were able to see from the
south<00:05:33.810> and<00:05:34.020> east<00:05:34.169> from<00:05:34.289> a<00:05:34.470> safe<00:05:34.650> vantage<00:05:34.860> point

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 
south and east from a safe vantage point

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.120 
south and east from a safe vantage point
and<00:05:35.460> you<00:05:35.580> might<00:05:35.789> see<00:05:36.060> a<00:05:36.090> couple<00:05:36.240> of

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:37.130 
and you might see a couple of

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:39.320 
and you might see a couple of
circulations<00:05:38.130> there<00:05:38.370> coming<00:05:38.970> up<00:05:39.030> toward<00:05:39.300> the

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.330 
circulations there coming up toward the

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.480 
circulations there coming up toward the
areas<00:05:39.690> near<00:05:40.200> the<00:05:40.229> Brooksville<00:05:40.830> area<00:05:41.160> so<00:05:41.310> let's

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490 
areas near the Brooksville area so let's

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.180 
areas near the Brooksville area so let's
get<00:05:42.270> both<00:05:42.539> of<00:05:42.570> these<00:05:42.870> involved<00:05:43.710> in<00:05:44.039> the

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:44.190 
get both of these involved in the

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.010 
get both of these involved in the
tracking<00:05:44.490> certainly<00:05:45.360> though<00:05:45.479> it<00:05:45.599> looks<00:05:45.780> like

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020 
tracking certainly though it looks like

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.379 
tracking certainly though it looks like
the<00:05:46.349> second<00:05:47.039> one<00:05:47.160> is<00:05:47.340> beginning<00:05:47.639> to<00:05:47.880> take<00:05:48.120> over

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:48.389 
the second one is beginning to take over

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:50.600 
the second one is beginning to take over
and<00:05:48.960> you<00:05:49.050> see<00:05:49.200> Starkville<00:05:49.800> well<00:05:50.070> to<00:05:50.280> the<00:05:50.400> north

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:50.610 
and you see Starkville well to the north

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:52.400 
and you see Starkville well to the north
of<00:05:50.760> this<00:05:50.910> but<00:05:51.090> reports<00:05:51.599> of<00:05:51.810> the<00:05:51.960> Mississippi

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:52.410 
of this but reports of the Mississippi

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:54.050 
of this but reports of the Mississippi
University<00:05:52.889> campus<00:05:53.250> up<00:05:53.430> in<00:05:53.580> Starkville

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.060 
University campus up in Starkville

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.930 
University campus up in Starkville
seeing<00:05:54.690> debris<00:05:55.440> falling<00:05:55.950> to<00:05:56.310> the<00:05:56.400> ground<00:05:56.669> in

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:56.940 
seeing debris falling to the ground in

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.360 
seeing debris falling to the ground in
this<00:05:57.030> area<00:05:57.090> so<00:05:57.599> giving<00:05:57.900> you<00:05:57.990> an<00:05:58.110> idea<00:05:58.560> of<00:05:58.830> just

00:05:59.360 --> 00:05:59.370 
this area so giving you an idea of just

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:02.000 
this area so giving you an idea of just
how<00:05:59.550> large<00:06:00.000> these<00:06:00.360> storms<00:06:00.870> are<00:06:01.080> and<00:06:01.440> how

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:02.010 
how large these storms are and how

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:03.950 
how large these storms are and how
strong<00:06:02.039> some<00:06:03.000> of<00:06:03.090> the<00:06:03.150> updrafts<00:06:03.690> when<00:06:03.780> these

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960 
strong some of the updrafts when these

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:12.470 
strong some of the updrafts when these
storms<00:06:04.169> are

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:12.480 

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.540
