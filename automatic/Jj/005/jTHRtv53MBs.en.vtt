00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
version of iOS 7 and I've had time to

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.099 
version of iOS 7 and I've had time to
play<00:00:17.970> around<00:00:18.150> with<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.390> new<00:00:18.539> features<00:00:18.990> and

play around with the new features and

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.650 
play around with the new features and
stuff<00:00:19.380> and<00:00:20.220> yeah<00:00:20.460> I<00:00:20.640> really<00:00:20.880> do<00:00:21.060> like<00:00:21.270> it

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
stuff and yeah I really do like it

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.810 
stuff and yeah I really do like it
the<00:00:22.320> only<00:00:22.439> problem<00:00:23.100> is<00:00:23.220> is<00:00:23.340> that<00:00:23.369> it<00:00:23.580> does<00:00:23.699> have

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
the only problem is is that it does have

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.609 
the only problem is is that it does have
a<00:00:23.880> few<00:00:24.150> books<00:00:24.359> you<00:00:24.779> know<00:00:24.930> since<00:00:25.199> with<00:00:25.380> it<00:00:25.470> being

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
a few books you know since with it being

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.679 
a few books you know since with it being
a<00:00:25.710> beta<00:00:25.920> version<00:00:26.250> of<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:27.300> operating<00:00:27.570> system

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
a beta version of the operating system

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.439 
a beta version of the operating system
and<00:00:28.260> I'm<00:00:28.920> pretty<00:00:29.160> sure<00:00:29.220> Apple<00:00:29.670> fixed<00:00:30.060> them<00:00:30.210> in

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
and I'm pretty sure Apple fixed them in

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.260 
and I'm pretty sure Apple fixed them in
the<00:00:30.570> final<00:00:30.990> version<00:00:31.140> or<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.710> gold<00:00:31.890> master<00:00:32.270> of

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
the final version or the gold master of

the final version or the gold master of
iOS<00:00:33.690> 7<00:00:34.050> or<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.500> upcoming<00:00:34.920> releases<00:00:35.340> when<00:00:35.760> they

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
iOS 7 or the upcoming releases when they

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.959 
iOS 7 or the upcoming releases when they
bring<00:00:36.480> out<00:00:36.600> new<00:00:36.840> beta<00:00:37.050> versions<00:00:37.559> of<00:00:37.680> it<00:00:37.969> so

yeah<00:00:39.829> now<00:00:41.149> the<00:00:42.149> thing<00:00:42.329> I<00:00:42.420> like<00:00:42.570> about<00:00:42.600> this<00:00:42.989> is

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
yeah now the thing I like about this is

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.930 
yeah now the thing I like about this is
that<00:00:43.200> it's<00:00:43.620> different<00:00:44.250> on<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.730> lock<00:00:44.910> screen

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
that it's different on the lock screen

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.850 
that it's different on the lock screen
you'll<00:00:45.450> notice<00:00:45.750> that<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.110> lock<00:00:46.350> screen<00:00:46.649> looks

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
you'll notice that the lock screen looks

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.000 
you'll notice that the lock screen looks
completely<00:00:47.370> different<00:00:47.629> so<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.750> UI<00:00:49.710> looks

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
completely different so the UI looks

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.560 
completely different so the UI looks
completely<00:00:50.370> different<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.090> previous

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
completely different to the previous

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.090 
completely different to the previous

looks<00:01:39.930> really<00:01:40.110> nice<00:01:40.640> it<00:01:41.640> is<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:42.119> flat<00:01:42.509> design

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
looks really nice it is a flat design

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.730 
looks really nice it is a flat design
compared<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.009> last<00:01:45.320> you<00:01:46.320> know<00:01:46.439> design

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
compared to the last you know design

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.510 
compared to the last you know design
what<00:01:47.090> because<00:01:48.090> pretty<00:01:48.240> much<00:01:48.329> it<00:01:48.630> was<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.899> same

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
what because pretty much it was the same

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.130 
what because pretty much it was the same
throughout<00:01:50.520> iOS<00:01:51.060> for<00:01:51.570> iOS<00:01:52.259> 3<00:01:53.060> iOS<00:01:54.060> 5<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.720> yeah

throughout iOS for iOS 3 iOS 5 and yeah

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.639 
throughout iOS for iOS 3 iOS 5 and yeah
but<00:01:55.590> it<00:01:55.860> looks<00:01:56.040> really<00:01:56.250> nice<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:57.649> another

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649

applications so for example if I open up
settings<00:04:48.900> you<00:04:49.900> get<00:04:50.020> a<00:04:50.050> completely<00:04:50.440> different

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
yes and that goes for the folders as

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.040 
yes and that goes for the folders as
well<00:04:56.680> so<00:04:56.979> if<00:04:57.070> we<00:04:57.220> open<00:04:57.550> for<00:04:58.240> example<00:04:58.330> my<00:04:58.810> apps
