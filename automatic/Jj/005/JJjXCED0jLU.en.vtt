with I planted this last year and it
didn't<00:00:21.420> really<00:00:21.630> grow<00:00:21.900> that<00:00:22.170> much<00:00:22.380> this<00:00:22.710> past

to prune them at the end of winter and

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
the beginning of spring and so what I'm

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.130 
the beginning of spring and so what I'm
doing<00:00:32.460> here<00:00:32.790> is<00:00:33.000> I'm<00:00:33.149> going<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.420> take<00:00:33.630> off<00:00:33.840> some

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
doing here is I'm going to take off some

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.889 
doing here is I'm going to take off some
unnecessary<00:00:34.500> limbs<00:00:35.280> because<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.120> idea<00:00:36.510> here

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
unnecessary limbs because the idea here

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.440 
unnecessary limbs because the idea here
is<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.350> grow<00:00:37.770> this<00:00:37.980> tree<00:00:38.399> up<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.820> have<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.180> nice

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
is to grow this tree up to have a nice

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.440 
is to grow this tree up to have a nice
broad<00:00:39.989> canopy<00:00:40.770> with<00:00:41.219> strong<00:00:41.670> limbs<00:00:42.000> that<00:00:42.270> can

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
broad canopy with strong limbs that can

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.170 
broad canopy with strong limbs that can
support<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:42.989> heavy<00:00:43.260> fruit<00:00:43.649> spot<00:00:44.040> as<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.670> tree

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
support a heavy fruit spot as the tree

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.360 
support a heavy fruit spot as the tree
begins<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.719> mature<00:00:45.870> so<00:00:46.739> what<00:00:46.890> I'm<00:00:46.980> gonna<00:00:47.070> do<00:00:47.250> is

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
begins to mature so what I'm gonna do is

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.950 
begins to mature so what I'm gonna do is
I'm<00:00:47.460> gonna<00:00:47.579> use<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:47.820> pair<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.270> really<00:00:48.450> sharp

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
I'm gonna use a pair of really sharp

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.040 
I'm gonna use a pair of really sharp
bypass<00:00:49.739> pruners<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.700> when<00:00:51.059> I<00:00:51.090> say<00:00:51.510> bypass

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
bypass pruners and when I say bypass

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.010 
bypass pruners and when I say bypass
that<00:00:52.289> means<00:00:52.559> that<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.250> cutting<00:00:53.670> blade

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
that means that the cutting blade

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.779 
that means that the cutting blade
bypasses<00:00:55.020> this<00:00:55.469> base<00:00:55.770> blade<00:00:56.190> here<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.670> the

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
bypasses this base blade here to the

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.360 
bypasses this base blade here to the
side<00:00:57.059> when<00:00:57.629> you<00:00:57.660> prune<00:00:58.079> you<00:00:58.350> want<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.649> use<00:00:59.100> the

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
side when you prune you want to use the

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.180 
side when you prune you want to use the
cutting<00:00:59.910> side<00:01:00.270> at<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.690> bottom<00:01:00.719> of<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.440> stem

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
cutting side at the bottom of a stem

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.179 
cutting side at the bottom of a stem
this<00:01:02.460> size<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:03.180> you<00:01:03.600> just<00:01:03.780> want<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.129> take<00:01:05.129> it

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
this size and you just want to take it

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.289 
this size and you just want to take it
off<00:01:05.400> like<00:01:05.700> that

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
off like that

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.140 
off like that
nice<00:01:07.290> clean<00:01:07.710> cut<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.250> what<00:01:08.400> you're<00:01:08.549> after<00:01:08.700> and

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
nice clean cut is what you're after and

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.910 
nice clean cut is what you're after and
you<00:01:09.780> want<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:10.020> make<00:01:10.140> sure<00:01:10.380> that<00:01:10.560> you<00:01:10.680> leave<00:01:10.890> a

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
you want to make sure that you leave a

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.219 
you want to make sure that you leave a
little<00:01:11.250> bit<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.729> branch<00:01:12.030> collar<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:13.020> see

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
little bit of the branch collar you see

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.590 
little bit of the branch collar you see
this<00:01:13.610> wrinkled<00:01:15.409> rounded<00:01:17.240> formation<00:01:18.240> at<00:01:18.540> the

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
this wrinkled rounded formation at the

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.660 
this wrinkled rounded formation at the
base<00:01:18.869> of<00:01:18.900> this<00:01:19.259> limb<00:01:19.560> or<00:01:19.860> where<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.220> limb<00:01:20.400> was

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
base of this limb or where the limb was

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.120 
base of this limb or where the limb was
that's<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.810> branch<00:01:22.200> color<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:22.770> that's<00:01:22.860> what

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
that's the branch color and that's what

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.760 
that's the branch color and that's what
gives<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.700> limbs<00:01:23.909> strength<00:01:24.540> over<00:01:24.960> time<00:01:25.200> and

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
gives the limbs strength over time and

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.320 
gives the limbs strength over time and
what<00:01:25.950> will<00:01:26.070> happen<00:01:26.280> now<00:01:26.700> is<00:01:26.880> that<00:01:27.030> branch

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
what will happen now is that branch

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.870 
what will happen now is that branch
collar<00:01:27.689> will<00:01:28.080> grow<00:01:28.380> over<00:01:28.740> this<00:01:29.159> wound<00:01:29.520> and

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
collar will grow over this wound and

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.420 
collar will grow over this wound and
cover<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.479> within<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.320> year<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:32.100> I'm<00:01:32.340> just

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
cover it within a year and I'm just

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.679 
cover it within a year and I'm just
going<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.670> go<00:01:32.820> along<00:01:33.090> here<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.390> I'm<00:01:33.479> going<00:01:33.600> to

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
going to go along here and I'm going to

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.300 
going to go along here and I'm going to
clean<00:01:33.900> this<00:01:33.930> up<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.409> little<00:01:34.560> bit<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:34.950> take<00:01:35.130> off

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
clean this up a little bit and take off

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.240 
clean this up a little bit and take off
some<00:01:35.549> of<00:01:35.579> these<00:01:35.729> little<00:01:36.420> stubs<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.290> see<00:01:38.070> that

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
some of these little stubs and see that

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.760 
some of these little stubs and see that
limb<00:01:38.520> is<00:01:38.729> really<00:01:38.970> not<00:01:39.119> one<00:01:39.390> that<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:39.689> needs<00:01:39.930> no

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
limb is really not one that it needs no

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.760 
limb is really not one that it needs no
this<00:01:41.009> one<00:01:41.250> or<00:01:41.490> this<00:01:41.970> one<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.479> I've<00:01:43.140> brought<00:01:43.649> it

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
this one or this one and I've brought it

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.499 
this one or this one and I've brought it
up<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.100> point<00:01:44.340> where<00:01:44.729> you'll<00:01:44.939> have<00:01:45.119> three

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
up to a point where you'll have three

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.020 
up to a point where you'll have three
major<00:01:45.780> limbs<00:01:46.259> as<00:01:46.590> this<00:01:46.740> tree<00:01:47.130> begins<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.759> grow

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
major limbs as this tree begins to grow

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.300 
major limbs as this tree begins to grow
all<00:01:48.659> right<00:01:48.840> now<00:01:49.350> one<00:01:49.740> of<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.890> rules<00:01:50.100> in

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
all right now one of the rules in

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.270 
all right now one of the rules in

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
pruning is always remove the 3ds dead

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.270 
pruning is always remove the 3ds dead
diseased<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.869> damaged<00:01:55.439> and<00:01:55.829> what<00:01:56.159> I've

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
diseased and damaged and what I've

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.209 
diseased and damaged and what I've
noticed<00:01:56.310> here<00:01:56.939> I've<00:01:57.180> got<00:01:57.540> a<00:01:57.780> diseased<00:01:58.649> limb

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
noticed here I've got a diseased limb

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.700 
noticed here I've got a diseased limb
here<00:01:59.759> that<00:02:00.180> is<00:02:00.329> dead<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:00.899> I'm<00:02:01.259> going<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.500> take

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
here that is dead and I'm going to take

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.800 
here that is dead and I'm going to take
that<00:02:01.950> off<00:02:02.219> and<00:02:02.820> I'm<00:02:02.939> going<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.149> take<00:02:03.360> it<00:02:03.570> off
