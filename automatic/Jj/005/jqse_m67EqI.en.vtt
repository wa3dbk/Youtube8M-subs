00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
I know context mostly no matter what
we'll<00:01:28.270> move<00:01:28.420> around<00:01:28.630> a<00:01:28.720> little<00:01:28.810> bit<00:01:28.960> in<00:01:29.080> your

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
we'll move around a little bit in your

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.080 
we'll move around a little bit in your
eye<00:01:29.200> but<00:01:29.500> when<00:01:29.619> they're<00:01:29.860> colored<00:01:30.729> like<00:01:30.880> this

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
eye but when they're colored like this

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.760 
eye but when they're colored like this
and<00:01:31.330> they're<00:01:31.750> a<00:01:31.780> little<00:01:31.900> bit<00:01:32.020> bigger<00:01:32.200> they

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
and they're a little bit bigger they

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.890 
and they're a little bit bigger they
move<00:01:32.979> in<00:01:33.100> like<00:01:33.220> different<00:01:33.369> directions<00:01:34.270> so<00:01:34.600> I

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900 
move in like different directions so I

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.450 
move in like different directions so I
will<00:01:35.170> have<00:01:35.290> one<00:01:35.500> pupil<00:01:35.770> that's<00:01:36.100> going<00:01:36.310> that

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
will have one pupil that's going that

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.010 
will have one pupil that's going that
way<00:01:36.610> and<00:01:36.640> another<00:01:36.880> pupil<00:01:37.210> going<00:01:37.479> that<00:01:37.659> way<00:01:37.810> or

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
way and another pupil going that way or

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.890 
way and another pupil going that way or
that<00:01:38.200> way<00:01:38.380> and<00:01:38.549> it's<00:01:39.549> a<00:01:39.670> little<00:01:39.909> awkward<00:01:40.030> so<00:01:40.540> I

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 
that way and it's a little awkward so I

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.080 
that way and it's a little awkward so I
wear<00:01:41.259> them<00:01:41.470> on<00:01:41.560> special<00:01:41.829> occasions<00:01:42.490> I<00:01:42.759> don't

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
wear them on special occasions I don't

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.340 
wear them on special occasions I don't
believe<00:01:43.299> that<00:01:43.329> these<00:01:43.570> contacts<00:01:44.020> were<00:01:44.170> meant

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
believe that these contacts were meant

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:45.990 
believe that these contacts were meant
to<00:01:44.409> be<00:01:44.560> worn<00:01:44.770> for<00:01:45.009> long<00:01:45.189> periods<00:01:45.549> of<00:01:45.579> time<00:01:45.759> so

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
to be worn for long periods of time so

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.609 
to be worn for long periods of time so
I'd<00:01:46.299> highly<00:01:46.659> recommend<00:01:46.689> just<00:01:47.200> wearing<00:01:47.409> them

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
for I'd say four hours at a time and

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:53.100 
for I'd say four hours at a time and
maybe<00:01:51.189> take<00:01:51.400> them<00:01:51.549> out<00:01:51.700> I<00:01:51.939> only<00:01:52.570> am<00:01:52.780> able<00:01:53.049> to

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110
