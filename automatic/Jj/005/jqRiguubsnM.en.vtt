I<00:03:14.260> was<00:03:14.830> going<00:03:15.010> to<00:03:15.069> say<00:03:15.220> this<00:03:15.340> was<00:03:15.490> the<00:03:15.550> last

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700

more than that it's the last corner
we've<00:03:19.480> got<00:03:19.510> to<00:03:19.750> turn<00:03:19.930> because<00:03:20.560> we're<00:03:20.860> at

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
we've got to turn because we're at
