really<00:03:12.459> powerful<00:03:12.970> character<00:03:13.750> but<00:03:13.930> the<00:03:14.019> only

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
really powerful character but the only

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.640 
really powerful character but the only
problem<00:03:14.470> is<00:03:15.660> he's<00:03:16.660> low<00:03:16.900> on<00:03:17.110> health<00:03:17.349> when

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.080 
problem is he's low on health when
you're<00:03:17.830> using<00:03:18.099> him<00:03:18.340> but<00:03:18.580> if<00:03:18.670> you're<00:03:18.819> fighting

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
you're using him but if you're fighting
