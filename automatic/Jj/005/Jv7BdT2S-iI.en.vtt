00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.560
 Hi, I'm German, thank you very much, everyone. 

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:07.240
 friends of the greco mainly to the 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.540
 blue cross fans that I always 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.540
 support 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:15.160
 Well, German, as well, well, well 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.439
 we said in the presentation today 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.930
 you are the blue cross scorer how do you 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:21.970
 you feel I say the team maybe is not 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.140
 having the results that they deserve 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.800
 they deserve more in every game 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.630
 how do you feel about your contribution until the 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.750
 moment in the team 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:34.300
 I know that the team can perform a lot 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:37.570
 more we are working hard 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:42.730
 for that let's continue I feel 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:45.970
 very happy here very happy to be 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:49.300
 part of all that I hope that all 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:51.970
 days I can improve every day more then 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.930
 I will do everything for that and that you 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:57.670
 that the victories or helm grow out there 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.199
 in a situation where you are 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.570
 suffering the equipment is in the part 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:04.360
 front are working on something 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:08.080
 special for definitions maybe 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.910
 if we are working a lot 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.820
 now we improve a little more 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:15.460
 offensively playing with robots that 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.920
 they are very smart to play I have 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.440
 certainty that every day we're going we're going to 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.260
 go down much more for this stage goal of 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.330
 Xavi that which is more victory than 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:28.330
 more important than us are 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.280
 looking is this triumph to win not 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.940
 just for us as for all the 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.320
 hobby today the consul maybe you'll 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.970
 they commented before reaching the team 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.030
 but it's a team that has cost him 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:42.610
 work winning titles are 17 years old without 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.440
 do it now it seems that they have all the 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.470
 human material to achieve it 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.670
 it seems to be the mission despite the moment 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.520
 that go through it seems that the objective 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:55.150
 finally it is to win titles I think 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:58.119
 that if this would be my biggest dream here in 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:00.550
 blue cross artistic plan us 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:03.070
 we know about all the pressure we have 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:06.220
 many years ago in winning a title 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:08.289
 then we have to do everything to 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.450
 pay this kind of me 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.599
 let's do I have certainty let's 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:17.930
 pay a lot that would be my biggest dream 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:20.460
 even much more here today 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.190
 just that is another issue not many 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.410
 foreigners have come to blue cross and have 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.830
 gone without pain or glory and I imagine 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:32.240
 that you do not want that, maybe not your idea 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.240
 is to make a mark on this team 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.180
 this my biggest goal to win a title here 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:39.950
 with blue cross make history because it is 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.719
 a club that gives you all the support of 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.750
 all the infrastructure to work 

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:46.730
 then we deserve decided and we will 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.489
 do everything for that we are working 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.620
 I am very sure that only with work 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:54.409
 let's go how to get your title so 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.170
 important today over there with a little 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:58.579
 complicated maybe now with the return 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.650
 of ro that suddenly art and 7 that you 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:02.930
 complicated because bp that headline soon 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.599

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.010
 you played next to rock but you did not 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:08.180
 it remains more than working maybe not to 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.459
 Although you are the one who is 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.139
 making the goals finally yes true 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:15.079
 but I have to always respect 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:16.669
 my coach's decision that is for 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:19.220
 me training very smart then 

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:20.870
 I just have to work and leave 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.450
 everything in your hands 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.549

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.790
