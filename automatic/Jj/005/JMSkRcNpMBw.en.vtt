 in the same being in phase of tests in the mpt already is in three levels more 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.830
 commented and awaited from recent times as great as his 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.240
 acceptance are the controversies about dengue who still do not have goals 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.220
 clear the player himself 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.220
 just survive edmund passed 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:23.720
 but after all 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.429
 which makes the biggest deficit so interesting 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:31.139
 the technician has prepared this video that can help you answer this question 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.720
 the world of fertile May is made because polygonal 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.040
 everything around you is made of blocks with a size that is annoying something like 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.180
 with pieces of lego 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.860
 you did not want a tool the feature at the beginning except the ones 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.990
 soon to start producing their first tools is essential to 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:02.120
 survive the perils of the night 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.120
 collecting the wood from the water is a good start 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.330
 besides collecting resources from any part of the world marie claire t too 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.210
 allows the transformation of the raw material into by-products with 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.119
 tools 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:20.040
 to be called pet 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.400
 transformation can be done in your character's inventory menu but it is 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.400
 much more effective if we have a working bench 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.560
 This is the first thing we are going to build. 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.210
 first we need to put the stem blocks of the trees that we are in the 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.740
 square of crack which will result in the star after wooden ' 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.860
 steps drags voice to fill all squares 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.430
 forming the design of a trunk the bench will appear on the side 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.740
 now that we have positioned the bench in the scenario we can use it to 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.550
 build our first tool to pick wood ' 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:16.739
 the idea is to form the drawing of a pick in the squares using sticks 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:21.159
 to the cable a spokesman on the top if the 

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:24.249
 correct the tool will appear immediately 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:29.479
 we can use the pick to collect stones and build a shelter 

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:33.039
 it will not be long until the musicians appear 

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:36.039
 staying out of the woods is not a good idea 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:40.449
 survive after the first night 

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:45.189
 we are already equipped with more durable tools and we can venture 

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:48.189
 in the darkness of the caves 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:58.770
 exploring the mine interior is one of the biggest challenges of the game is not 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.140
 Difficult to find worlds over there on the other side the deeper the bells 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.760
 the higher the frequency with which we found primary metals such as iron and uruguay 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.149
 I already asked the client 

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:13.879
 game animals can also offer various kinds of features 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:18.260
 Sheep wool is especially useful because with it you can build a 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.469
 bed which makes the night pasini more quickly 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:33.819
 there are virtually no limits to what you can do your 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:39.430
 May pet criticism by the giants to roller coasters I'm even called 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.029
 iron at a fair you can build children by train and the years to make a 

00:03:44.029 --> 00:03:46.809
 faster means of transport 

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:50.559
 you can also call your friends to collaborate in building your 

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:51.120
 time 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.240
 few or almost one of the many servers open on the internet 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:03.359
 examples of monumental works being shared around the 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:04.050
 lack 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.050
 How's that for us? 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:11.409
 or this game of old 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:14.650
 made with blocks that can behave like logic circuits 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:24.930
 There are also lots of different game pots that can 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.530
 have to change the original textures is to transform an aesthetic the world vip 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:33.529
 This was just a bet. 

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:35.580
 more needs to be done 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:36.949
