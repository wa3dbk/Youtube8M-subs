00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
the bad with this particular watch now

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.160 
the bad with this particular watch now
it's<00:02:08.729> a<00:02:08.910> 42<00:02:09.330> millimeter<00:02:10.080> I<00:02:10.379> have<00:02:11.069> a<00:02:11.099> 6<00:02:11.640> and

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
it's a 42 millimeter I have a 6 and

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.520 
it's a 42 millimeter I have a 6 and
three-quarter<00:02:13.170> inch

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
three-quarter inch

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.680 
three-quarter inch
wrists<00:02:13.830> and<00:02:15.440> it<00:02:16.440> just<00:02:16.890> barely<00:02:17.459> fits<00:02:18.120> me<00:02:18.450> I

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
wrists and it just barely fits me I

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.080 
wrists and it just barely fits me I
think<00:02:19.140> if<00:02:19.260> they<00:02:19.380> hadn't<00:02:19.590> made<00:02:19.709> it<00:02:19.770> a

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090

to give them a little bit more force to

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:25.370 
to give them a little bit more force to
get<00:04:24.810> them<00:04:24.960> going

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380

case is completely sealed now which is

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.400 
case is completely sealed now which is
kinda<00:05:41.430> nice<00:05:41.580> if<00:05:41.880> you<00:05:42.150> look<00:05:42.420> through<00:05:43.050> the<00:05:43.080> side

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:43.410 
kinda nice if you look through the side

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:45.790 
kinda nice if you look through the side
you<00:05:43.680> can<00:05:43.800> see<00:05:44.070> like<00:05:44.250> the<00:05:44.370> sandwich<00:05:44.820> style

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 
you can see like the sandwich style

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.830 
you can see like the sandwich style
movement<00:05:46.800> and<00:05:47.040> they<00:05:48.030> don't<00:05:48.210> really<00:05:48.450> tell<00:05:48.720> you

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 
movement and they don't really tell you

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.300 
movement and they don't really tell you
about<00:05:48.930> that<00:05:49.320> but<00:05:49.560> if<00:05:49.620> you're<00:05:49.740> going<00:05:49.920> to<00:05:50.070> read

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.310 
about that but if you're going to read

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:51.830 
about that but if you're going to read
anything<00:05:50.490> it<00:05:51.120> just<00:05:51.150> says<00:05:51.510> about<00:05:51.750> the

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 
anything it just says about the

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.260 
anything it just says about the
exhibition<00:05:52.170> case<00:05:52.650> back<00:05:53.010> but<00:05:53.730> I<00:05:53.760> think<00:05:54.090> that's

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:54.270 
exhibition case back but I think that's

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.090 
exhibition case back but I think that's
actually<00:05:54.600> kind<00:05:54.840> of<00:05:54.960> cool<00:05:55.170> but<00:05:55.470> then<00:05:55.710> it's<00:05:55.980> a

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:56.100 
actually kind of cool but then it's a

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.070 
actually kind of cool but then it's a
double-edged<00:05:56.550> sword<00:05:56.970> because<00:05:57.180> needs<00:05:57.750> to<00:05:57.900> say

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
double-edged sword because needs to say

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.580 
double-edged sword because needs to say
the<00:05:58.980> case<00:05:59.280> can't<00:05:59.730> be<00:05:59.850> open<00:06:00.450> now<00:06:00.780> we<00:06:01.530> are

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:01.590 
the case can't be open now we are

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:03.710 
the case can't be open now we are
talking<00:06:01.860> about<00:06:02.160> the<00:06:02.460> warranty<00:06:03.090> earlier<00:06:03.570> it

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 
talking about the warranty earlier it

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.110 
talking about the warranty earlier it

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120 
does come with a 2-year warranty so if

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.030 
does come with a 2-year warranty so if
you<00:06:06.210> do<00:06:06.360> have<00:06:06.510> a<00:06:06.570> problem<00:06:07.020> with<00:06:07.230> it<00:06:07.410> you<00:06:07.590> can

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:08.040 
you do have a problem with it you can

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.710

daily<00:06:22.020> driver<00:06:22.380> so<00:06:22.740> I<00:06:22.770> shouldn't<00:06:23.160> have<00:06:23.280> any

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:23.550 
daily driver so I shouldn't have any

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.580 
daily driver so I shouldn't have any
problems<00:06:24.180> with<00:06:24.330> it<00:06:24.360> I<00:06:24.570> only<00:06:24.840> wear<00:06:25.110> this<00:06:25.320> maybe

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:25.590 
problems with it I only wear this maybe

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:28.970 
problems with it I only wear this maybe
once<00:06:26.010> twice<00:06:26.160> a<00:06:26.430> month<00:06:26.930> but<00:06:27.930> it<00:06:28.260> would<00:06:28.560> be<00:06:28.770> nice

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:28.980 
once twice a month but it would be nice

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:30.740 
once twice a month but it would be nice
to<00:06:29.010> know<00:06:29.310> that<00:06:29.340> you<00:06:29.610> could<00:06:29.940> get<00:06:30.180> it<00:06:30.330> serviced

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:30.750 
to know that you could get it serviced

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:32.870 
to know that you could get it serviced
if<00:06:30.960> it<00:06:31.110> ever<00:06:31.350> needed<00:06:32.040> servicing<00:06:32.700> but

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:32.880 
if it ever needed servicing but

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.310 
if it ever needed servicing but
obviously<00:06:33.300> the<00:06:33.510> service<00:06:33.960> rate<00:06:34.169> would

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:34.320 
obviously the service rate would

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.080 
obviously the service rate would
probably<00:06:34.710> cost<00:06:34.919> more<00:06:35.160> than<00:06:35.310> the<00:06:35.400> watch<00:06:35.550> itself

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:36.090 
probably cost more than the watch itself

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:38.190 
probably cost more than the watch itself
if<00:06:36.330> you<00:06:36.419> did<00:06:36.660> go<00:06:36.870> ahead<00:06:36.900> and<00:06:37.229> do<00:06:37.410> that

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:38.200 
if you did go ahead and do that

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.650 
if you did go ahead and do that
but<00:06:38.470> to<00:06:38.650> me<00:06:38.770> that<00:06:38.800> is<00:06:39.160> a<00:06:39.190> big<00:06:39.490> drawback<00:06:39.880> so<00:06:40.450> if

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:40.660 
but to me that is a big drawback so if

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:42.600 
but to me that is a big drawback so if
the<00:06:40.810> watch<00:06:41.020> does<00:06:41.350> die<00:06:41.680> on<00:06:41.890> me<00:06:42.040> later<00:06:42.250> on<00:06:42.340> down

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:42.610 
the watch does die on me later on down

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.730 
the watch does die on me later on down
the<00:06:42.670> road<00:06:42.820> I<00:06:43.300> will<00:06:43.420> not<00:06:43.720> purchase<00:06:44.050> another<00:06:44.530> one

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:44.740 
the road I will not purchase another one

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:45.990 
the road I will not purchase another one
like<00:06:44.890> this<00:06:44.920> I'll<00:06:45.220> probably<00:06:45.400> just<00:06:45.820> you<00:06:45.880> know

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:46.000 
like this I'll probably just you know

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.030 
like this I'll probably just you know
stash<00:06:46.330> it<00:06:46.600> in<00:06:46.690> the<00:06:46.810> collection<00:06:47.350> but<00:06:47.740> now<00:06:47.920> if

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:48.040 
stash it in the collection but now if

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.890 
stash it in the collection but now if
they<00:06:48.160> come<00:06:48.400> out<00:06:48.430> with<00:06:48.880> something<00:06:49.300> like<00:06:49.660> this

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:49.900 
they come out with something like this

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:52.770 
they come out with something like this
but<00:06:50.140> maybe<00:06:50.350> in<00:06:50.530> a<00:06:50.620> chronograph<00:06:51.270> you<00:06:52.270> know<00:06:52.510> I'll

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:52.780 
but maybe in a chronograph you know I'll

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:55.710 
but maybe in a chronograph you know I'll
consider<00:06:53.230> buying<00:06:53.530> a<00:06:53.800> second<00:06:54.280> one<00:06:54.550> but<00:06:55.270> all<00:06:55.540> in

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:55.720 
consider buying a second one but all in

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.200 
consider buying a second one but all in
all<00:06:55.900> this<00:06:56.680> will<00:06:56.920> be<00:06:57.040> the<00:06:57.160> last<00:06:57.370> one

00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:58.210 
all this will be the last one

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:01.560 
all this will be the last one
