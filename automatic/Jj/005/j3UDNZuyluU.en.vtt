00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
and I'm gonna do this so I think that

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.600 
and I'm gonna do this so I think that
it's<00:02:14.349> mostly<00:02:14.500> just<00:02:14.739> a<00:02:14.920> suit<00:02:15.099> with<00:02:15.159> a<00:02:15.220> girl<00:02:15.430> you

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
it's mostly just a suit with a girl you

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.160 
it's mostly just a suit with a girl you
know<00:02:15.730> it's<00:02:15.879> kind<00:02:16.060> of<00:02:16.090> expected<00:02:16.629> it's<00:02:16.930> kind<00:02:17.110> of

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
know it's kind of expected it's kind of

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.210 
know it's kind of expected it's kind of
the<00:02:17.319> norm<00:02:17.530> that<00:02:18.010> a<00:02:18.489> girl<00:02:19.650> likes<00:02:20.650> it<00:02:20.860> when<00:02:21.010> a<00:02:21.040> guy

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
the norm that a girl likes it when a guy

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.039 
the norm that a girl likes it when a guy
does<00:02:21.459> that<00:02:21.640> so<00:02:21.790> it's<00:02:22.000> not<00:02:22.209> that<00:02:22.390> they<00:02:22.480> never<00:02:22.720> do

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:23.049 
does that so it's not that they never do

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:25.740 
does that so it's not that they never do
and<00:02:23.200> I'm<00:02:23.290> sure<00:02:23.560> in<00:02:23.860> some<00:02:24.189> cases<00:02:24.760> I<00:02:25.180> fit<00:02:25.599> girl

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
and I'm sure in some cases I fit girl

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.720 
and I'm sure in some cases I fit girl
really<00:02:25.930> likes<00:02:26.079> a<00:02:26.290> guy<00:02:26.439> and<00:02:26.860> maybe<00:02:27.370> he<00:02:27.579> hasn't

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
really likes a guy and maybe he hasn't

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.369 
really likes a guy and maybe he hasn't
made<00:02:27.970> the<00:02:28.000> move<00:02:28.299> she'll<00:02:28.629> go<00:02:28.810> and<00:02:28.989> ask<00:02:29.079> him<00:02:29.230> out

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:29.379 
made the move she'll go and ask him out

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:31.289 
made the move she'll go and ask him out
but<00:02:29.709> I<00:02:29.980> think<00:02:30.430> it's<00:02:30.549> mostly<00:02:30.819> just<00:02:30.940> like<00:02:31.150> girls

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299 
but I think it's mostly just like girls

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:34.170 
but I think it's mostly just like girls
you<00:02:31.569> know<00:02:31.690> they<00:02:31.930> like<00:02:32.049> that<00:02:32.349> so<00:02:32.940> that's<00:02:33.940> how<00:02:34.150> I
