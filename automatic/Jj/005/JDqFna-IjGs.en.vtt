ten<00:02:10.840> into<00:02:11.080> the<00:02:11.200> application<00:02:12.450> in<00:02:13.450> order<00:02:13.600> to

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
ten into the application in order to

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:20.730 
ten into the application in order to
make<00:02:14.050> the<00:02:15.630> serum<00:02:16.630> work<00:02:18.690> best<00:02:19.690> it<00:02:20.350> is<00:02:20.500> good<00:02:20.710> to

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
make the serum work best it is good to

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.520 
make the serum work best it is good to
apply<00:02:21.520> some<00:02:21.850> cold<00:02:22.120> air<00:02:22.330> so<00:02:22.690> that<00:02:22.720> it<00:02:23.020> dries<00:02:23.260> up

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
apply some cold air so that it dries up

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.550 
apply some cold air so that it dries up
quite<00:02:24.010> quickly<00:02:24.570> it<00:02:25.570> will<00:02:25.630> probably<00:02:26.020> put<00:02:26.170> a<00:02:26.230> fan

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
quite quickly it will probably put a fan

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.220 
quite quickly it will probably put a fan
on<00:02:26.590> to<00:02:27.130> pauline's<00:02:28.120> face<00:02:28.360> and<00:02:28.630> few<00:02:28.810> minutes<00:02:29.110> or

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
on to pauline's face and few minutes or

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.980 
on to pauline's face and few minutes or
few<00:02:29.380> seconds<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:31.120> other<00:02:31.240> alternative<00:02:31.330> if<00:02:31.930> you

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
few seconds the other alternative if you

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.840 
few seconds the other alternative if you
don't<00:02:32.170> have<00:02:32.290> a<00:02:32.320> fan<00:02:32.590> handy<00:02:32.950> is<00:02:33.040> to<00:02:33.220> use<00:02:33.340> a<00:02:33.370> hair

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
don't have a fan handy is to use a hair

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.270 
don't have a fan handy is to use a hair
dryer<00:02:33.880> with<00:02:34.480> the<00:02:34.750> heat<00:02:35.620> turned<00:02:35.860> off<00:02:36.100> obviously

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
dryer with the heat turned off obviously

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.940 
dryer with the heat turned off obviously
so<00:02:36.820> it's<00:02:36.910> blowing<00:02:37.120> cold<00:02:37.360> air<00:02:37.570> we<00:02:38.440> can<00:02:38.650> just<00:02:38.770> use

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
so it's blowing cold air we can just use

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.630 
so it's blowing cold air we can just use
a<00:02:38.980> paper<00:02:39.280> fan<00:02:39.550> then<00:02:40.240> onto<00:02:40.720> your<00:02:40.810> face<00:02:41.460> you<00:02:42.460> seem
