that<00:00:51.239> let's<00:00:51.570> get<00:00:51.719> into<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:52.020> multiplayer

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
that let's get into the multiplayer

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.080

aspect now the multiplayer is awesome I

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.830 
aspect now the multiplayer is awesome I
think<00:00:54.300> it's<00:00:54.390> perfectly<00:00:54.930> balanced<00:00:55.410> thus<00:00:55.680> far

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
think it's perfectly balanced thus far

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.119 
think it's perfectly balanced thus far
but<00:00:57.840> no<00:00:57.989> one<00:00:58.140> wants<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.440> hear<00:00:58.559> how<00:00:58.710> good<00:00:58.920> it<00:00:59.039> is

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
with a pistol into debt you know it

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.870 
with a pistol into debt you know it
you're<00:01:31.710> taking<00:01:32.130> because<00:01:32.460> it's<00:01:32.610> just

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
you're taking because it's just

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.160 
you're taking because it's just
happening<00:01:33.119> like<00:01:33.240> 20<00:01:33.540> times<00:01:33.720> in<00:01:33.869> that<00:01:34.020> last

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
happening like 20 times in that last

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.590 
happening like 20 times in that last
game<00:01:34.490> um<00:01:35.490> but<00:01:35.939> other<00:01:36.060> than<00:01:36.180> that<00:01:36.270> you<00:01:36.540> know

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
game um but other than that you know

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.080 
game um but other than that you know
it's<00:01:36.810> all<00:01:36.930> right<00:01:37.140> i<00:01:37.290> think<00:01:37.619> that<00:01:38.060> with<00:01:39.060> no

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
it's all right i think that with no

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.179 
it's all right i think that with no
stopping<00:01:39.659> parents<00:01:40.049> definitely<00:01:40.470> noticeable

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
stopping parents definitely noticeable

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.560 
stopping parents definitely noticeable
like<00:01:41.460> if<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:41.700> don't<00:01:41.880> have<00:01:42.000> sleight<00:01:42.270> of<00:01:42.299> hand

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
like if you don't have sleight of hand

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.090 
like if you don't have sleight of hand
pro<00:01:42.659> on<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.200> there's<00:01:43.320> two<00:01:43.439> guys<00:01:43.649> coming<00:01:44.009> at
