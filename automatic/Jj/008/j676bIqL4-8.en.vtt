somebody<00:00:05.839> up<00:00:05.990> front<00:00:06.350> hits<00:00:06.799> the<00:00:06.979> brakes

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:07.220 
somebody up front hits the brakes

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.039 
somebody up front hits the brakes
something<00:00:08.059> runs<00:00:08.240> out<00:00:08.420> in<00:00:08.510> front<00:00:08.660> of<00:00:08.780> them<00:00:08.900> but

00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:09.049 
something runs out in front of them but

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:11.230 
something runs out in front of them but
there<00:00:09.230> may<00:00:09.350> be<00:00:09.379> cars<00:00:09.769> in<00:00:09.950> between<00:00:10.340> you<00:00:10.519> maybe

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:11.240 
there may be cars in between you maybe

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.850 
there may be cars in between you maybe
this<00:00:11.480> guy<00:00:11.719> in<00:00:11.930> front<00:00:12.110> he<00:00:12.200> is<00:00:12.349> not<00:00:12.530> paying

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:12.860 
this guy in front he is not paying

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.250 
this guy in front he is not paying
attention<00:00:13.369> at<00:00:13.490> that<00:00:13.639> point<00:00:13.969> in<00:00:14.059> time<00:00:14.109> you<00:00:15.109> will

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:15.260 
attention at that point in time you will

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.320 
attention at that point in time you will
get<00:00:15.410> a<00:00:15.469> signal<00:00:16.010> that<00:00:16.490> the<00:00:16.670> brakes<00:00:16.910> are<00:00:17.119> being

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.330 
get a signal that the brakes are being

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.720 
get a signal that the brakes are being
put<00:00:17.570> on<00:00:17.720> ahead<00:00:18.140> of<00:00:18.320> you<00:00:18.470> even<00:00:19.039> though<00:00:19.189> the<00:00:19.430> car

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:19.730 
put on ahead of you even though the car

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.120 
put on ahead of you even though the car
directly<00:00:20.119> inhale<00:00:20.660> you<00:00:20.869> is<00:00:21.109> not<00:00:21.529> putting<00:00:21.890> on

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.130 
directly inhale you is not putting on

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.730 
directly inhale you is not putting on
their<00:00:22.339> brakes<00:00:22.640> okay<00:00:23.449> so<00:00:24.289> you<00:00:24.349> can<00:00:24.560> see

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740 
their brakes okay so you can see

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.560 
their brakes okay so you can see
there'll<00:00:24.949> be<00:00:25.009> a<00:00:25.099> pretty<00:00:25.400> large<00:00:25.730> gap<00:00:26.150> here

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:26.570 
there'll be a pretty large gap here

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:49.180 
there'll be a pretty large gap here
between<00:00:26.599> the<00:00:27.109> cars

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.610 

right<00:00:50.210> system<00:00:51.210> works<00:00:51.450> on<00:00:51.780> its<00:00:52.080> car-to-car

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
right system works on its car-to-car

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.680 
right system works on its car-to-car
system<00:00:53.310> so<00:00:53.520> all<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.820> cars<00:00:54.030> have<00:00:54.240> more<00:00:54.510> or<00:00:54.570> less

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
system so all the cars have more or less

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.720 
system so all the cars have more or less
along<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.200> lines<00:00:55.410> of<00:00:55.530> like<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.710> GPS<00:00:55.980> system

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
along the lines of like a GPS system

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.410 
along the lines of like a GPS system
that<00:00:57.330> cars<00:00:57.660> basically<00:00:57.960> speaking<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.830> this<00:00:58.980> car

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.079 

in<00:01:01.839> this<00:01:01.989> scenario<00:01:02.339> we'll<00:01:03.339> just<00:01:03.550> assume<00:01:03.850> we

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
in this scenario we'll just assume we

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:06.359 
in this scenario we'll just assume we
can't<00:01:04.330> see<00:01:04.629> down<00:01:04.809> the<00:01:05.019> road<00:01:05.049> I'm<00:01:05.740> trying<00:01:06.220> to

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 
can't see down the road I'm trying to

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:08.280 
can't see down the road I'm trying to
come<00:01:06.700> out<00:01:06.820> of<00:01:06.880> this<00:01:07.090> intersection<00:01:07.659> I'm<00:01:08.020> again

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
come out of this intersection I'm again

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.740 
come out of this intersection I'm again
i'm<00:01:08.439> assuming<00:01:08.740> maybe<00:01:09.159> i<00:01:09.310> have<00:01:09.670> the<00:01:09.700> right<00:01:10.420> away

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
i'm assuming maybe i have the right away

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.830 
i'm assuming maybe i have the right away
but<00:01:11.500> i<00:01:11.560> can't<00:01:11.860> see<00:01:12.070> what's<00:01:12.310> coming<00:01:12.720> when<00:01:13.720> this

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
but i can't see what's coming when this

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.450 
but i can't see what's coming when this
guy<00:01:14.080> comes<00:01:14.320> through<00:01:14.560> the<00:01:14.710> intersection<00:01:15.130> the

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
guy comes through the intersection the

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.249 
guy comes through the intersection the
system<00:01:15.820> will<00:01:15.970> tell<00:01:16.149> me<00:01:16.299> someone's<00:01:16.689> coming<00:01:17.110> and

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259 
system will tell me someone's coming and

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:19.680 
system will tell me someone's coming and
that<00:01:17.799> we<00:01:18.340> could<00:01:18.580> be<00:01:18.759> ready<00:01:19.270> to<00:01:19.420> have<00:01:19.539> an

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
that we could be ready to have an

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:30.480 
that we could be ready to have an
accident<00:01:20.020> okay<00:01:20.500> roll<00:01:20.770> it<00:01:29.189> want<00:01:30.189> to<00:01:30.250> use<00:01:30.340> this

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
accident okay roll it want to use this

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.359 
accident okay roll it want to use this
technology<00:01:31.360> to<00:01:31.630> maximize<00:01:32.560> safety<00:01:32.830> to

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:33.369 
technology to maximize safety to

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:35.639 
technology to maximize safety to
minimize<00:01:33.909> vehicle<00:01:34.630> accidents<00:01:35.110> and<00:01:35.229> crashes

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:35.649 
minimize vehicle accidents and crashes

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:37.770 
minimize vehicle accidents and crashes
well<00:01:36.490> right<00:01:36.759> now<00:01:36.789> this<00:01:37.119> is<00:01:37.300> strictly<00:01:37.600> a

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
well right now this is strictly a

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.350 
well right now this is strictly a
research<00:01:38.170> phase<00:01:38.830> so<00:01:39.640> we<00:01:39.759> want<00:01:39.940> to<00:01:40.000> collect<00:01:40.149> all

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
research phase so we want to collect all

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.440 
research phase so we want to collect all
the<00:01:40.479> data<00:01:40.509> we<00:01:40.780> can<00:01:41.080> with<00:01:42.009> this<00:01:42.220> fleet<00:01:42.940> test<00:01:43.179> for

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
the data we can with this fleet test for

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.660 
the data we can with this fleet test for
the<00:01:43.600> next<00:01:43.899> year<00:01:44.170> and<00:01:44.380> if<00:01:45.069> everything<00:01:45.429> goes

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
the next year and if everything goes

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.100 
the next year and if everything goes
well<00:01:45.729> in<00:01:46.299> which<00:01:46.959> the<00:01:47.709> prospect<00:01:48.190> is<00:01:48.280> very<00:01:48.490> good

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
well in which the prospect is very good

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.510 
well in which the prospect is very good
maybe<00:01:50.110> we'll<00:01:50.380> see<00:01:50.440> something<00:01:50.950> you<00:01:51.399> know

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
maybe we'll see something you know

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.830 
maybe we'll see something you know
within<00:01:52.299> 10<00:01:52.659> years<00:01:53.159> this<00:01:54.159> is<00:01:54.340> reveal<00:01:54.909> this<00:01:55.600> is

within 10 years this is reveal this is

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.719 
within 10 years this is reveal this is
where<00:01:56.049> there<00:01:56.679> will<00:01:56.740> be<00:01:56.830> a<00:01:56.860> car<00:01:57.100> stopped<00:01:57.490> in<00:01:57.610> the

where there will be a car stopped in the
middle<00:01:57.759> of<00:01:58.000> the<00:01:58.090> road<00:01:58.299> we'll<00:01:58.990> be<00:01:59.020> following

middle of the road we'll be following

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:01.559 
middle of the road we'll be following
along<00:01:59.619> with<00:01:59.950> this<00:02:00.100> car<00:02:00.369> assuming<00:02:01.240> the<00:02:01.390> disc

car is going to react he will swerve out

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:07.529 
car is going to react he will swerve out
of<00:02:04.539> the<00:02:04.720> way<00:02:04.899> because<00:02:05.590> he<00:02:05.950> has<00:02:06.130> room<00:02:06.399> will<00:02:07.359> be

of the way because he has room will be

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:15.330 
of the way because he has room will be

this is left turn assist we're assuming
that<00:02:18.740> we<00:02:18.860> can't<00:02:19.190> see<00:02:19.430> because<00:02:19.670> another<00:02:20.090> car<00:02:20.390> is

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
that we can't see because another car is

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.270 
that we can't see because another car is
blocking<00:02:20.810> our<00:02:21.140> way<00:02:21.170> we'd<00:02:21.500> like<00:02:21.710> to<00:02:21.860> let<00:02:22.040> make<00:02:22.250> a

that's a fairly large car we can't see

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.510 
that's a fairly large car we can't see
what<00:02:26.750> we're<00:02:26.870> doing<00:02:27.140> it<00:02:27.740> will<00:02:27.950> alert<00:02:28.190> you<00:02:28.490> that
