anyway<00:05:52.750> the<00:05:52.930> second<00:05:53.230> circle<00:05:53.620> I'm<00:05:53.740> going<00:05:53.770> to

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:54.040 
anyway the second circle I'm going to

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.010 
anyway the second circle I'm going to
prepare<00:05:54.460> will<00:05:54.760> be<00:05:54.940> a<00:05:54.970> little<00:05:55.300> bigger<00:05:55.510> than<00:05:55.720> the

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.020 
prepare will be a little bigger than the

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.890 
prepare will be a little bigger than the
circle<00:05:56.650> I<00:05:56.830> just<00:05:57.070> made<00:05:57.310> so<00:05:57.970> I<00:05:58.000> will<00:05:58.390> make<00:05:58.600> in<00:05:58.780> the

00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:58.900 
circle I just made so I will make in the

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.900 
circle I just made so I will make in the
new<00:05:59.110> circle<00:05:59.560> simply<00:05:59.950> using<00:06:00.280> two<00:06:00.460> superdude

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:00.910 
new circle simply using two superdude

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:03.420 
new circle simply using two superdude
beads<00:06:01.180> more<00:06:01.600> and<00:06:01.900> following<00:06:02.770> the<00:06:02.890> steps<00:06:03.220> I

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:03.430 
beads more and following the steps I

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.550 
beads more and following the steps I
used<00:06:03.670> previously<00:06:04.000> the<00:06:04.780> result<00:06:05.110> will<00:06:05.320> be<00:06:05.440> the

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:05.560 
used previously the result will be the

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:24.590 
used previously the result will be the
same

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:24.600 

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.600 

okay<00:06:25.600> done<00:06:25.840> is<00:06:26.230> now<00:06:26.530> time<00:06:26.860> to<00:06:26.890> add<00:06:27.310> the

okay done is now time to add the
external<00:06:28.060> by<00:06:28.450> cons<00:06:28.750> and<00:06:28.990> you<00:06:29.050> see<00:06:29.650> that<00:06:29.890> I<00:06:30.040> will

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:30.310 
external by cons and you see that I will

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.030 
external by cons and you see that I will
join<00:06:30.490> both<00:06:30.760> circles<00:06:31.360> at<00:06:31.660> the<00:06:31.840> bottom<00:06:32.290> by<00:06:32.560> one

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:33.040 
join both circles at the bottom by one

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:36.330 
join both circles at the bottom by one
problem<00:06:33.460> by<00:06:33.640> phone<00:06:34.170> so<00:06:35.170> I<00:06:35.200> insert<00:06:35.800> nine<00:06:36.100> by

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:36.340 
problem by phone so I insert nine by

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:39.210 
problem by phone so I insert nine by
cons<00:06:36.640> and<00:06:36.940> the<00:06:37.720> last<00:06:37.930> by<00:06:38.140> Khan<00:06:38.410> I<00:06:38.590> have<00:06:38.980> to

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:39.220 
cons and the last by Khan I have to

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:41.580 
cons and the last by Khan I have to
insert<00:06:39.700> is<00:06:40.030> the<00:06:40.240> background<00:06:40.690> I<00:06:40.780> got<00:06:41.110> at<00:06:41.350> the

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:41.590 
insert is the background I got at the

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:45.060 
insert is the background I got at the
bottom<00:06:41.860> of<00:06:42.310> the<00:06:42.700> first<00:06:43.060> circle<00:06:43.740> so<00:06:44.740> both

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:45.070 
bottom of the first circle so both

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:47.520 
bottom of the first circle so both
circles<00:06:45.730> are<00:06:45.970> sharing<00:06:46.540> one<00:06:46.810> by<00:06:47.050> Khan<00:06:47.350> and

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:47.530 
circles are sharing one by Khan and

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:50.190 
circles are sharing one by Khan and
doing<00:06:47.950> so<00:06:48.160> I<00:06:48.340> joined<00:06:48.400> both<00:06:48.880> circles<00:06:49.330> very<00:06:49.540> easy

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:50.200 
doing so I joined both circles very easy

00:06:50.200 --> 00:07:20.090 
doing so I joined both circles very easy
isn't<00:06:50.590> it

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:20.100 

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:23.420 

then<00:07:20.820> to<00:07:21.420> finish<00:07:21.750> the<00:07:21.900> earring<00:07:22.380> I<00:07:22.560> have<00:07:23.130> only

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:23.430 
then to finish the earring I have only

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:26.900 
then to finish the earring I have only
to<00:07:23.880> add<00:07:24.090> I'm<00:07:24.390> hearing<00:07:24.960> hook<00:07:25.320> and<00:07:25.800> insert<00:07:26.040> it<00:07:26.640> in

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:26.910 
to add I'm hearing hook and insert it in

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:39.260 
to add I'm hearing hook and insert it in
the<00:07:27.000> loop<00:07:27.180> I<00:07:27.390> prepare<00:07:27.810> brittle<00:07:37.700> and<00:07:38.700> here<00:07:39.120> you

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:39.270 
the loop I prepare brittle and here you

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:41.360 
the loop I prepare brittle and here you
are<00:07:39.300> it<00:07:39.690> can<00:07:39.960> look<00:07:40.200> very<00:07:40.470> difficult<00:07:41.190> but

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:41.370 
are it can look very difficult but

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:43.640 
are it can look very difficult but
working<00:07:41.700> with<00:07:41.910> super<00:07:42.420> duo<00:07:42.600> beads<00:07:42.870> is<00:07:43.140> very<00:07:43.380> fun

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:43.650 
working with super duo beads is very fun

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:46.580 
working with super duo beads is very fun
and<00:07:43.920> the<00:07:44.430> difficult<00:07:45.060> things<00:07:45.450> turns<00:07:46.170> funny

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:46.590 
and the difficult things turns funny
