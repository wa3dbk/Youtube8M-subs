00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.110 

okay<00:03:16.840> there<00:03:17.019> we<00:03:17.110> go<00:03:17.230> you<00:03:18.220> can<00:03:18.370> practically<00:03:18.850> see

okay there we go you can practically see
it<00:03:19.209> there<00:03:19.390> but<00:03:19.420> basically<00:03:20.019> it<00:03:20.820> stops<00:03:21.820> water

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
it there but basically it stops water

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.470 
it there but basically it stops water
and<00:03:22.600> dust<00:03:23.140> and<00:03:23.410> a<00:03:23.769> bunch<00:03:24.280> of<00:03:24.459> other<00:03:24.820> rainy

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.830 
and dust and a bunch of other rainy
stuff<00:03:25.900> from<00:03:26.110> getting<00:03:26.230> inside<00:03:26.500> the<00:03:26.739> USB<00:03:27.840> micro

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
stuff from getting inside the USB micro

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.370 
stuff from getting inside the USB micro
USB<00:03:29.320> port<00:03:29.350> as<00:03:29.890> well<00:03:29.950> as<00:03:30.790> the<00:03:31.450> microphone<00:03:31.870> port

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
USB port as well as the microphone port

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.880 
USB port as well as the microphone port
so<00:03:33.100> this<00:03:34.060> phone<00:03:34.300> is<00:03:34.510> somewhat<00:03:35.380> safe<00:03:35.620> around

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
so this phone is somewhat safe around

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.229 
so this phone is somewhat safe around

came<00:04:32.720> with<00:04:32.900> in<00:04:33.710> this<00:04:33.830> case<00:04:34.660> and<00:04:35.660> then<00:04:36.110> another

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
came with in this case and then another

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.560 
came with in this case and then another
thing<00:04:36.590> is<00:04:36.650> that<00:04:37.100> even<00:04:37.940> if<00:04:38.030> you<00:04:38.120> drop<00:04:38.419> the

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
thing is that even if you drop the

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.740 
thing is that even if you drop the
device<00:04:38.930> the<00:04:39.500> case<00:04:40.340> by<00:04:40.639> itself<00:04:40.669> or<00:04:41.240> choose<00:04:41.449> from

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
device the case by itself or choose from

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.650 
device the case by itself or choose from
the<00:04:41.840> top<00:04:42.080> so<00:04:42.530> it<00:04:43.310> will<00:04:43.520> never<00:04:43.729> actually<00:04:44.120> touch

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
the top so it will never actually touch

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.310 
the top so it will never actually touch
its<00:04:44.900> face<00:04:45.229> of<00:04:45.590> the<00:04:46.039> screen<00:04:46.400> just<00:04:46.970> the<00:04:47.840> size<00:04:48.110> of

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
its face of the screen just the size of

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.770 
its face of the screen just the size of

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
good case sometimes I don't like

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.080 
good case sometimes I don't like
carrying<00:05:36.919> it<00:05:37.159> around<00:05:37.250> because<00:05:37.729> it's<00:05:37.849> a<00:05:37.970> little

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.090 
carrying it around because it's a little

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:41.670 
carrying it around because it's a little
bit<00:05:38.240> bulky<00:05:38.690> but<00:05:39.590> it<00:05:39.979> does<00:05:40.340> give<00:05:40.970> off<00:05:41.000> that

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 
bit bulky but it does give off that

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.339 
bit bulky but it does give off that
beautiful<00:05:42.680> finish<00:05:43.039> and<00:05:43.820> I<00:05:44.030> think<00:05:44.479> that<00:05:44.690> these

00:05:45.339 --> 00:05:45.349 
beautiful finish and I think that these

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:47.080 
beautiful finish and I think that these
case<00:05:45.680> makers<00:05:46.039> actually<00:05:46.400> did<00:05:46.639> a<00:05:46.669> really<00:05:46.909> good

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.090
