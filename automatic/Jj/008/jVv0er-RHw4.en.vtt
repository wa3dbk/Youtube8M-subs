00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:08.010
 we tested the last experience of 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.660
 four tablets of sony which is a 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.880
 tablet of excellent quality and that is 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.320
 especially very fine extremely light the 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.000
 problem is that it is a little expensive 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:22.350
 we are going to wonder today if she 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:23.640
 is too expensive technically 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.010
 the tablet is not really expensive 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.720
 since it brings in just about every 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.359
 components at the top of the sector 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.529
 currently starting with a screen 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.120
 which is really of excellent quality 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.360
 that goes very far in the reds and the 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.800
 green 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.030
 so it's not necessarily true but 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.260
 it's very pleasing to the eye 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.420
 processor is very powerful 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.950
 will settle gones 1110 so who 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.300
 overheating in smartphones but who 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.860
 behaves pretty well in this 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.300
 tablet especially that sony manages to 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.730
 to have a good autonomy 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.829
 8am in our new test pretty severe 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.930
 which is a good score the tablet does 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.460
 not too much heat either the only real 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.440
 problem is that it is difficult to 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.480
 reload since it actually consumes 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.960
 more energy than his charger can him 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.579
 to bring 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.230
 so in fact to load it it takes or 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.670
 tin or do not use it 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.850
 finally design question is still 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.080
 enough the top for a tablet like that 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.240
 the finer than the ipad 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.460
 it is much lighter than the ipad 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.720
 makes less than 400 grams what is 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.610
 pretty good for a tablet 10 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.830
 inches we can hold them in that direction 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.439
 100k weighs too much on the fingers and for 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.759
 crown it all is waterproof 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:23.820
 ip 68 certified 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:30.090
 so no that technically and 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:32.430
 not too expensive this tablet was supposed 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.049
 to be sold from 550 euros in its 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.430
 wifi version which was a pretty price 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.619
 acceptable for a tablet top of 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.990
 range of this quality the only problem 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.689
 it's with the euro dollar dance she 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.369
 is now 599 euros version 4g 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.409
 is at 699 euros 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.659
 and in these circumstances yes we can 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.280
 start to find it a bit expensive 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.220
 second thing is the keyboard 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.409
 optional which is sold separately but which 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.939
 is very convenient that allows the tablet 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.740
 to become a real little 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.960
 laptop while under android 1 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.880
 obviously the problem is that the 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.350
 keys are a bit small as the 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.850
 keyboard does not integrate a second 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.290
 battery so in fact it's almost a 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.390
 plastic tip and that that bit of 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:13.250
 plastic is sold 120 euros alas yes 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.250
 actually it's way too expensive
