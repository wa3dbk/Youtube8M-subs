you<00:01:59.100> have<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.520> identify<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.570> other<00:02:00.719> keys<00:02:00.990> this

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
you have to identify the other keys this

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.660 
you have to identify the other keys this
should<00:02:01.619> be<00:02:01.710> used<00:02:02.340> with<00:02:02.850> each<00:02:03.119> finger<00:02:03.689> and<00:02:03.899> and

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
should be used with each finger and and

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.340 
should be used with each finger and and
this<00:02:05.670> you<00:02:05.820> do<00:02:05.939> by<00:02:06.119> sliding<00:02:06.600> them<00:02:06.840> up<00:02:07.020> and<00:02:07.200> down

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
this you do by sliding them up and down

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.949 
this you do by sliding them up and down
right<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:08.039> left<00:02:08.099> like<00:02:09.060> you<00:02:09.090> see<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.599> pattern

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
right and left like you see the pattern

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.080 
right and left like you see the pattern
below<00:02:10.289> you<00:02:10.979> can<00:02:11.039> see<00:02:11.250> which<00:02:11.430> finger<00:02:11.819> should<00:02:12.000> be

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
below you can see which finger should be

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.180 
below you can see which finger should be
useful<00:02:12.239> for

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
useful for

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.730 
useful for
letters<00:02:14.190> and<00:02:14.220> so<00:02:14.610> forth<00:02:14.880> but<00:02:15.620> you<00:02:16.620> always

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
letters and so forth but you always

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.809 
letters and so forth but you always
start<00:02:17.190> up<00:02:17.310> with<00:02:17.459> the<00:02:17.550> main<00:02:17.730> position<00:02:18.240> asdf<00:02:18.990> and

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
start up with the main position asdf and

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.800 
start up with the main position asdf and
JKL<00:02:20.819> and<00:02:21.330> semicolon<00:02:23.450> then<00:02:24.450> you<00:02:24.540> need<00:02:24.690> to

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
JKL and semicolon then you need to

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.320 
JKL and semicolon then you need to
practice<00:02:25.160> typed<00:02:26.160> alphabet<00:02:26.700> so<00:02:26.880> you<00:02:26.970> can<00:02:27.150> learn

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
practice typed alphabet so you can learn

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.480 
practice typed alphabet so you can learn
what<00:02:28.170> different<00:02:28.230> letters<00:02:28.830> are<00:02:29.010> you<00:02:29.190> start

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
what different letters are you start

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.199 
what different letters are you start
typing<00:02:29.640> out<00:02:29.910> ABCDE<00:02:30.690> and<00:02:31.230> then<00:02:32.100> you<00:02:32.250> can<00:02:32.430> get<00:02:33.090> in

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
typing out ABCDE and then you can get in

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:34.520 
typing out ABCDE and then you can get in
a<00:02:33.330> word<00:02:33.540> processor<00:02:34.050> and<00:02:34.140> you<00:02:34.200> can<00:02:34.320> start

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
a word processor and you can start

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.640 
a word processor and you can start
typing<00:02:34.680> some<00:02:35.040> words<00:02:35.310> and<00:02:35.730> so<00:02:36.630> you<00:02:36.720> get<00:02:36.870> a<00:02:36.930> more

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
typing some words and so you get a more

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.460 
typing some words and so you get a more
feeling<00:02:38.430> for<00:02:38.670> it<00:02:38.760> and<00:02:39.540> then<00:02:39.720> you<00:02:40.200> need<00:02:40.380> to

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
feeling for it and then you need to

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.120 
feeling for it and then you need to
focus<00:02:40.650> on<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:41.070> right<00:02:41.340> way<00:02:42.090> of<00:02:42.239> doing<00:02:42.270> things

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
focus on the right way of doing things

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.699 
focus on the right way of doing things
and<00:02:44.130> not<00:02:44.370> the<00:02:44.610> speed<00:02:45.230> thing<00:02:46.230> is<00:02:46.380> if<00:02:46.530> you<00:02:46.680> just

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
and not the speed thing is if you just

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.590 
and not the speed thing is if you just
focus<00:02:47.370> on<00:02:47.489> speed<00:02:47.790> you<00:02:47.940> will<00:02:48.030> type<00:02:48.270> so<00:02:48.450> much

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
focus on speed you will type so much

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.880 
focus on speed you will type so much
errors<00:02:48.900> you<00:02:49.050> have<00:02:49.200> to<00:02:49.320> use<00:02:49.470> just<00:02:49.500> a<00:02:49.709> back

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
errors you have to use just a back

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.800 
errors you have to use just a back
button<00:02:50.100> and<00:02:50.370> then<00:02:50.489> you<00:02:50.640> actually<00:02:51.120> slow<00:02:51.780> down

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
button and then you actually slow down

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.050 
button and then you actually slow down
your<00:02:52.019> speed<00:02:52.440> instead<00:02:52.800> of<00:02:52.920> improving<00:02:53.489> it<00:02:53.640> just

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
your speed instead of improving it just

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.699 
your speed instead of improving it just
take<00:02:54.540> it<00:02:54.570> slow<00:02:54.690> in<00:02:55.019> the<00:02:55.110> beginning<00:02:55.230> and<00:02:55.560> in

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
take it slow in the beginning and in

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.850 
take it slow in the beginning and in
practice<00:02:56.250> and<00:02:56.690> this<00:02:57.690> coordination<00:02:58.410> that<00:02:58.709> you

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
practice and this coordination that you

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.800 
practice and this coordination that you
practice<00:02:59.340> that's<00:02:59.580> that's<00:02:59.940> the<00:03:00.450> important

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
practice that's that's the important

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.199 
practice that's that's the important
part<00:03:01.019> to<00:03:01.140> know<00:03:01.350> where<00:03:01.530> the<00:03:01.650> keys<00:03:01.860> are<00:03:05.209> okay

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
part to know where the keys are okay

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:07.310 
part to know where the keys are okay
here's<00:03:06.420> some<00:03:06.570> other<00:03:06.660> things<00:03:06.750> that<00:03:07.019> you<00:03:07.170> can

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
here's some other things that you can

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.560 
here's some other things that you can
help<00:03:07.470> you<00:03:07.650> out<00:03:07.680> when<00:03:08.040> it<00:03:08.160> comes<00:03:08.370> to<00:03:08.610> type

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
help you out when it comes to type

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.770 
help you out when it comes to type
faster<00:03:10.580> you<00:03:11.580> need<00:03:11.910> to<00:03:12.060> follow<00:03:12.330> the<00:03:12.570> rule<00:03:12.750> of

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
faster you need to follow the rule of

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.530 
faster you need to follow the rule of
good<00:03:13.380> pop<00:03:13.650> posture<00:03:14.310> I<00:03:14.489> know<00:03:14.670> sometimes<00:03:15.150> it's

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
good pop posture I know sometimes it's

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.240 
good pop posture I know sometimes it's
nice<00:03:15.660> staying<00:03:16.260> in<00:03:16.410> a<00:03:16.470> bed<00:03:16.650> and<00:03:16.830> doing<00:03:17.070> some

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
nice staying in a bed and doing some

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.979 
nice staying in a bed and doing some
typing<00:03:17.670> but<00:03:17.910> it<00:03:18.060> doesn't<00:03:18.360> really<00:03:18.450> help<00:03:18.660> you<00:03:18.870> in

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
typing but it doesn't really help you in

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.979 
typing but it doesn't really help you in
learning<00:03:19.549> so<00:03:20.549> you<00:03:20.579> need<00:03:21.000> to<00:03:21.150> slump<00:03:21.600> over<00:03:21.720> the

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
learning so you need to slump over the

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.660 
learning so you need to slump over the
keyboard<00:03:22.410> or<00:03:22.650> flopping<00:03:23.250> over<00:03:23.400> the<00:03:23.519> keyboard

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
keyboard or flopping over the keyboard

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.940 
keyboard or flopping over the keyboard
can<00:03:23.940> actually<00:03:24.239> restrict<00:03:24.720> you<00:03:24.870> and<00:03:25.079> which<00:03:25.769> can

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
can actually restrict you and which can

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.650 
can actually restrict you and which can
affect<00:03:26.220> the<00:03:26.310> efficiency<00:03:26.820> of<00:03:26.850> your<00:03:26.940> typing<00:03:27.480> so

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
affect the efficiency of your typing so

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.270 
affect the efficiency of your typing so
keep<00:03:27.900> those<00:03:28.049> shoulders<00:03:28.470> back<00:03:28.709> and<00:03:28.950> sit<00:03:29.160> up

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
keep those shoulders back and sit up

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.620 
keep those shoulders back and sit up
straight<00:03:29.579> at<00:03:29.730> a<00:03:29.760> time<00:03:30.030> you're<00:03:30.239> prepared<00:03:30.600> to

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
straight at a time you're prepared to

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.690 
straight at a time you're prepared to
plank<00:03:30.959> do<00:03:31.920> not<00:03:32.070> look<00:03:32.220> down

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
plank do not look down

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.240 
plank do not look down
try<00:03:33.239> typing<00:03:33.510> and<00:03:34.110> keep<00:03:34.440> on<00:03:34.590> practicing<00:03:35.100> so

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
try typing and keep on practicing so

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.210 
try typing and keep on practicing so
just<00:03:35.459> look<00:03:35.610> at<00:03:35.730> the<00:03:35.820> screen<00:03:36.120> and<00:03:36.239> type<00:03:36.630> and<00:03:37.220> I

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
just look at the screen and type and I

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.190 
just look at the screen and type and I
really<00:03:38.730> recommend<00:03:39.239> getting<00:03:39.630> a<00:03:39.810> typing

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
really recommend getting a typing

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.630 
really recommend getting a typing
software<00:03:40.680> it<00:03:40.829> really<00:03:41.070> helps<00:03:41.340> you<00:03:41.459> out

software it really helps you out
there's<00:03:42.180> several<00:03:42.690> out<00:03:42.989> there<00:03:43.260> and<00:03:43.470> that<00:03:44.220> you

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
there's several out there and that you

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.259 
there's several out there and that you
can<00:03:44.549> get<00:03:44.760> and<00:03:45.620> the<00:03:46.620> most<00:03:46.799> important<00:03:47.400> thing<00:03:47.519> for

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
can get and the most important thing for

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.060 
can get and the most important thing for
you<00:03:48.420> know<00:03:48.600> to<00:03:48.660> succeed<00:03:49.019> is<00:03:49.440> to<00:03:49.470> record<00:03:49.920> it

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
you know to succeed is to record it

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.430 
you know to succeed is to record it
progress<00:03:50.360> it's<00:03:51.360> really<00:03:51.660> fun<00:03:51.930> having<00:03:52.200> to

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
progress it's really fun having to
