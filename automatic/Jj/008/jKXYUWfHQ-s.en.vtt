quite<00:00:33.840> honestly<00:00:34.260> just<00:00:34.620> not<00:00:35.250> worthy<00:00:35.610> of<00:00:35.790> being

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
quite honestly just not worthy of being

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.630 
quite honestly just not worthy of being
top<00:00:36.270> five<00:00:36.480> clips<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:37.050> what<00:00:37.620> this<00:00:37.770> causes<00:00:38.309> is

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
top five clips and what this causes is

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.600 
top five clips and what this causes is
this<00:00:39.090> really<00:00:39.540> really<00:00:39.780> long<00:00:40.370> process<00:00:41.370> where<00:00:41.550> i

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
this really really long process where i

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.819 
this really really long process where i
have<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:41.850> go<00:00:42.000> through<00:00:42.390> far<00:00:43.140> more<00:00:43.320> clips<00:00:43.590> than<00:00:43.770> i

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
have to go through far more clips than i

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.380 
have to go through far more clips than i
should<00:00:43.860> ever<00:00:44.129> have<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:44.789> i<00:00:44.850> understand

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
should ever have to and i understand

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.180 
should ever have to and i understand
that<00:00:45.570> not<00:00:45.809> everybody<00:00:46.289> gets<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.829> greatest

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
that not everybody gets the greatest

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.650 
that not everybody gets the greatest
Clips<00:00:47.309> in<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.610> world<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:48.120> that's<00:00:48.210> completely

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
Clips in the world and that's completely

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.569 
Clips in the world and that's completely
fine<00:00:48.960> I'm<00:00:49.200> not<00:00:49.379> like<00:00:49.739> saying<00:00:50.129> that<00:00:50.370> you<00:00:50.460> know

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
fine I'm not like saying that you know

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.040 
fine I'm not like saying that you know
you're<00:00:50.789> bad<00:00:51.000> if<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.329> don't<00:00:51.480> get<00:00:51.570> great<00:00:51.780> clips

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
you're bad if you don't get great clips

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.720 
you're bad if you don't get great clips
because<00:00:52.170> most<00:00:52.559> of<00:00:52.710> them<00:00:52.860> are<00:00:52.980> based<00:00:53.100> on<00:00:53.430> luck

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
because most of them are based on luck

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.670 
because most of them are based on luck
I'm<00:00:54.030> just<00:00:54.300> saying<00:00:54.510> please<00:00:54.899> do<00:00:55.110> me<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.289> favor<00:00:55.469> and

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
clarify what is and isn't a top-five

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.580 
clarify what is and isn't a top-five
play<00:00:59.699> clip<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.120> then<00:01:00.510> i<00:01:00.539> will<00:01:00.660> get<00:01:00.899> into<00:01:01.350> how

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
play clip and then i will get into how

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.810 
play clip and then i will get into how
to<00:01:01.649> submit<00:01:01.949> your<00:01:02.190> clip<00:01:02.340> if<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:02.579> don't<00:01:02.730> know

to submit your clip if you don't know

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.630 
to submit your clip if you don't know
already<00:01:02.850> so<00:01:03.600> basically<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.890> main<00:01:05.129> problem

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
already so basically the main problem

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.920 
already so basically the main problem
that<00:01:05.670> most<00:01:05.939> people<00:01:06.270> seem<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.450> have<00:01:06.659> is

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
that most people seem to have is

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.260 
that most people seem to have is
distinguishing<00:01:07.560> what<00:01:07.770> is<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:08.100> montage<00:01:08.909> clip

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
distinguishing what is a montage clip

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.780 
distinguishing what is a montage clip
and<00:01:09.450> what<00:01:09.840> is<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:09.990> top<00:01:10.380> five<00:01:10.650> play<00:01:11.010> clip<00:01:11.369> so

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
and what is a top five play clip so

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.570 
and what is a top five play clip so
basically<00:01:12.210> things<00:01:12.689> like<00:01:12.930> quoz<00:01:13.409> phrase<00:01:13.860> things

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
basically things like quoz phrase things

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.700 
basically things like quoz phrase things
like<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:15.090> know<00:01:15.240> little<00:01:15.720> streaks<00:01:16.080> between

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
like you know little streaks between

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.950 
like you know little streaks between
five<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.189> you<00:01:17.909> know<00:01:18.030> eight<00:01:18.270> kills<00:01:18.600> are

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
five and you know eight kills are

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.260 
five and you know eight kills are
typically<00:01:19.770> going<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:20.100> be<00:01:20.250> montage<00:01:20.909> clips

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
typically going to be montage clips

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.050 
typically going to be montage clips
nothing<00:01:21.750> extremely<00:01:22.259> incredible<00:01:23.060> quads

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
nothing extremely incredible quads

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.760 
nothing extremely incredible quads
phrase<00:01:24.420> I<00:01:24.750> mean<00:01:24.869> people<00:01:25.080> literally<00:01:25.500> make

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
phrase I mean people literally make

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.880 
phrase I mean people literally make
montages<00:01:26.549> of<00:01:26.700> just<00:01:27.689> quads<00:01:27.960> phrase<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.740> they

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
montages of just quads phrase and they

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.010 
montages of just quads phrase and they
get<00:01:29.130> between<00:01:29.549> you<00:01:30.030> know<00:01:30.119> five<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.600> ten<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.810> day

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
get between you know five and ten a day

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.350 
get between you know five and ten a day
so<00:01:31.290> clearly<00:01:32.040> that's<00:01:32.520> not<00:01:32.640> going<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:32.970> be<00:01:33.000> like<00:01:33.299> a

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
so clearly that's not going to be like a

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.789 
so clearly that's not going to be like a
top<00:01:33.689> five<00:01:33.900> play<00:01:34.140> where<00:01:34.290> they<00:01:34.409> think<00:01:34.619> what<00:01:34.710> I'm

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
top five play where they think what I'm

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.980 
top five play where they think what I'm
looking<00:01:35.100> for<00:01:35.369> is<00:01:35.579> things<00:01:36.060> along<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.450> lines<00:01:36.659> of

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
was incredible and I had never even

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.160 
was incredible and I had never even
thought<00:01:48.600> that<00:01:48.659> that<00:01:48.960> would<00:01:49.049> be<00:01:49.110> possible

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
thought that that would be possible

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.490 
thought that that would be possible
maybe<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:49.979> 2<00:01:50.310> got<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.880> man<00:01:51.210> but<00:01:51.990> we<00:01:52.110> tried<00:01:52.320> maybe

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
maybe a 2 got to man but we tried maybe

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.649 
maybe a 2 got to man but we tried maybe
a<00:01:52.619> three<00:01:52.950> man<00:01:53.189> but<00:01:53.700> a<00:01:53.729> five<00:01:54.060> man<00:01:54.329> that<00:01:54.570> was
