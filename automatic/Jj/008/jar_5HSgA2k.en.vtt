test she bought us one coin on the top

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.140 
test she bought us one coin on the top
of<00:00:31.449> your<00:00:31.599> finger<00:00:31.810> tap<00:00:32.590> it<00:00:32.769> gently<00:00:32.980> on<00:00:33.730> its<00:00:33.910> edge

coin<00:00:46.449> has<00:00:46.600> been<00:00:46.660> tapped<00:00:49.949> so<00:00:50.949> now<00:00:51.159> we'll<00:00:51.370> try<00:00:51.550> it

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
coin has been tapped so now we'll try it

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.840 
coin has been tapped so now we'll try it
with<00:00:51.879> fake<00:00:52.180> silver<00:00:52.719> crown<00:00:53.050> coin<00:00:53.670> again<00:00:54.670> you

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
with fake silver crown coin again you

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.750 
with fake silver crown coin again you
did<00:00:55.000> the<00:00:55.089> same<00:00:55.269> test<00:00:55.890> balance<00:00:56.890> the<00:00:57.039> fake<00:00:57.250> crown

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
did the same test balance the fake crown

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.709 
did the same test balance the fake crown
coin<00:00:58.059> on<00:00:58.510> your<00:00:59.229> finger<00:00:59.589> and<00:00:59.860> tap<00:01:00.070> it<00:01:00.219> with<00:01:00.309> the

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
coin on your finger and tap it with the

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.389 
coin on your finger and tap it with the
original<00:01:01.719> crown<00:01:02.140> coin<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:05.619> this<00:01:05.799> time<00:01:06.039> you'll

00:01:06.389 --> 00:01:06.399 
original crown coin and this time you'll

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:08.760 
original crown coin and this time you'll
notice<00:01:06.640> that<00:01:06.970> there's<00:01:07.210> just<00:01:07.780> a<00:01:07.899> door<00:01:08.140> metallic

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
notice that there's just a door metallic

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.310 
notice that there's just a door metallic
thud<00:01:09.039> when<00:01:09.280> you<00:01:09.399> tap<00:01:09.580> the<00:01:09.610> coin<00:01:09.970> so<00:01:10.840> that<00:01:11.170> this

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
thud when you tap the coin so that this

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.950 
thud when you tap the coin so that this
that<00:01:11.950> this<00:01:12.340> coin<00:01:12.549> cannot<00:01:12.909> be<00:01:13.090> a<00:01:13.390> genuine

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.609 
that this coin cannot be a genuine
British<00:01:14.289> crown<00:01:14.560> coin<00:01:14.860> so<00:01:15.130> it's<00:01:15.280> a<00:01:15.369> fight<00:01:16.619> we

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
British crown coin so it's a fight we

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:20.399 
British crown coin so it's a fight we
take<00:01:17.830> another<00:01:18.330> fake<00:01:19.330> British<00:01:19.600> crown<00:01:19.990> call<00:01:20.259> in

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:20.409

and do the same test balance it on the

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.740 
and do the same test balance it on the
tip<00:01:24.039> of<00:01:24.069> your<00:01:24.190> finger<00:01:24.700> and<00:01:25.240> tap<00:01:25.450> it<00:01:25.600> on<00:01:25.720> the

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
tip of your finger and tap it on the

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.649 
tip of your finger and tap it on the
edge

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:31.180 

this<00:01:29.659> star<00:01:29.900> there's<00:01:30.140> a<00:01:30.200> slight<00:01:30.470> ringing<00:01:30.920> tone

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
this star there's a slight ringing tone

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.320 
this star there's a slight ringing tone
but<00:01:32.000> not<00:01:32.030> as<00:01:32.540> good<00:01:32.750> as<00:01:32.900> with<00:01:33.140> the<00:01:33.380> original

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
but not as good as with the original

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.210 
but not as good as with the original
silver<00:01:35.330> cloud<00:01:35.659> that<00:01:35.840> we<00:01:35.930> tried<00:01:36.170> earlier<00:01:36.380> so

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
silver cloud that we tried earlier so

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.580 
silver cloud that we tried earlier so
here<00:01:37.550> I<00:01:37.610> have<00:01:37.820> to<00:01:37.970> try<00:01:38.570> a<00:01:38.600> different<00:01:38.690> test<00:01:39.290> with

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
here I have to try a different test with

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.190 
here I have to try a different test with
a<00:01:39.619> neodymium<00:01:40.400> magnet<00:01:40.850> and<00:01:41.510> to<00:01:41.630> do<00:01:41.750> this<00:01:41.900> test

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
a neodymium magnet and to do this test

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.219 
a neodymium magnet and to do this test
you<00:01:42.380> hold<00:01:42.590> the<00:01:42.740> coin<00:01:43.010> at<00:01:43.190> 45<00:01:43.700> degrees<00:01:44.119> and<00:01:44.570> if

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
you hold the coin at 45 degrees and if

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.280 
you hold the coin at 45 degrees and if
this<00:01:45.350> point<00:01:45.619> is<00:01:45.830> genuine<00:01:46.340> 925<00:01:47.060> silver<00:01:47.390> the

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
this point is genuine 925 silver the

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.770 
this point is genuine 925 silver the
neodymium<00:01:49.009> magnet<00:01:49.400> will<00:01:49.640> gently<00:01:50.240> slide<00:01:50.540> down

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
neodymium magnet will gently slide down

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.800 
neodymium magnet will gently slide down
the<00:01:50.930> coin<00:01:51.140> to<00:01:51.380> the<00:01:51.409> bottom<00:01:52.300> but<00:01:53.300> in<00:01:53.420> this<00:01:53.570> case

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
the coin to the bottom but in this case

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.899 
the coin to the bottom but in this case
it<00:01:54.170> just<00:01:54.200> sticks<00:01:54.619> to<00:01:54.710> it<00:01:54.979> bringing<00:01:55.520> that<00:01:55.700> the

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
it just sticks to it bringing that the

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.600 
it just sticks to it bringing that the
metal<00:01:56.659> that<00:01:56.810> the<00:01:56.900> coins<00:01:57.110> made<00:01:57.470> of<00:01:57.710> is<00:01:57.950> magnetic

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
metal that the coins made of is magnetic

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.150 
metal that the coins made of is magnetic
and<00:01:58.790> that<00:01:59.450> silver<00:01:59.900> is<00:01:59.930> non-magnetic<00:02:00.619> this

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160 
and that silver is non-magnetic this

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.960 
and that silver is non-magnetic this
coin<00:02:01.460> also<00:02:02.000> has<00:02:02.240> to<00:02:02.420> be<00:02:02.509> a<00:02:02.539> fake<00:02:03.640> so<00:02:04.640> that's<00:02:04.820> how

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
coin also has to be a fake so that's how

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.719 
coin also has to be a fake so that's how
you<00:02:05.030> do<00:02:05.240> a<00:02:05.270> simple<00:02:05.750> test<00:02:06.500> for<00:02:06.619> you<00:02:07.340> pull<00:02:07.580> your

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
you do a simple test for you pull your

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.820 
you do a simple test for you pull your
silver<00:02:08.030> coins<00:02:08.269> using<00:02:08.660> the<00:02:08.899> ping<00:02:09.110> test<00:02:09.380> and<00:02:09.679> the

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
silver coins using the ping test and the

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.979 
silver coins using the ping test and the
neodymium<00:02:10.100> magnet<00:02:10.940> you<00:02:11.570> can<00:02:11.600> get<00:02:11.840> these
