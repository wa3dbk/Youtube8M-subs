00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
an extra half heart from enemies so you

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.870 
an extra half heart from enemies so you
might<00:01:13.439> be<00:01:13.470> dealing<00:01:13.710> more<00:01:13.890> damage<00:01:13.950> be<00:01:14.640> able<00:01:14.820> to

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
hit a good tactic is that I only use it

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:21.980 
hit a good tactic is that I only use it
on<00:01:20.909> players<00:01:21.180> that<00:01:21.360> have<00:01:21.450> better<00:01:21.600> gear<00:01:21.840> than

not look at them as a threat so try less
hard<00:01:25.560> this<00:01:26.100> means<00:01:26.369> you<00:01:26.460> can<00:01:26.580> surprise<00:01:26.790> them<00:01:27.030> by

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
hard this means you can surprise them by

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.050 
hard this means you can surprise them by
