00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 Servus people welcome to a new one 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.000
 edition of frank graf was in the last 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.099
 output busy again with comments 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.530
 Ask posted and today it goes down 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.840
 other things about the topic of breakage 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.900
 he is caused by weight training 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.670
 Also, how does my sixpack routine look like 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.710
 So what a belly training 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.270
 I do it all and much more 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.689
 There are more in this issue so 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.689
 keep going 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.810
 the first question from karin c and he 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.720
 I would like to know why you should be afraid 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.489
 a hernia have indeed afford yet 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.840
 you will be more often on people 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:38.390
 who worked with heavy weights 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.940
 and in the weight training we work with 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.409
 heavy weights and accordingly 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.149
 you have to be afraid of one 

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:46.120
 strength training exercises 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:48.320
 First of all, what is a broken strip 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:52.100
 lightly aware by way of imagining 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:55.840
 that divide yourselves before 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:01:00.079
 All muscles crave the connective tissue 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:03.710
 Push pushes that arises mostly 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:06.259
 in that muscles or the 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:10.039
 see the connective tissue what the guts 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:12.710
 protects weak and gaps 

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:15.619
 form and if then a big belly 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.950
 pressure occurs for example by the 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.880
 strong cough due to constipation or 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.470
 but for example by a 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.319
 then pregnancy can divide 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:27.380
 the guts through these gaps 

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:29.060
 Press this weak tissue through and 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.670
 then they are parts of the initiated 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:35.659
 so to speak before this protective layer 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:37.009
 muscles tend to be and that is usually 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:38.450
 so I'll be the best 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.270
 forms in the stop then the 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.979
 collect guts and the third then 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:48.500
 mostly in the lower abdomen 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:50.469
 or in the strip area and the 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.229
 cause for that has addressed 

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:55.460
 weak muscles in the area 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:57.170
 weak yearning respectively 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.780
 weak connective tissue so that in general 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.899
 the abdominal wall is very weak or but 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.939
 one suffers from a wide reach channel 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:06.560
 and then just break a breaker 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:09.109
 It's basically in the reason it is 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.729
 actually partly a tendency to 

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:11.690
 but he can really stop 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.340
 also occur 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.799
 because you are really very 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.600
 very unsportsmanlike 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:21.380
 Accordingly, people are the beginners 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:23.120
 should not weight too heavy 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.890
 but not at the beginning we work 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.170
 should first stop your customers 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.730
 musculature can break 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.609
 You can also prevent something by being 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.750
 stop the abdominal muscles training this 

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:35.030
 strengthens especially the lateral 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.290
 abdominal muscles and thereby one can 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:41.299
 just a strip break 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:42.909
 prevent something in the basics is prevent 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:45.290
 But it's not bad either 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:48.379
 I do not even think so 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.730
 very painful and it is a matter 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:51.859
 meanwhile very easy too 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.420
 can be treated surgically but in the 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:56.689
 every one of the regular sports 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.730
 operates and the entire body 

00:02:56.689 --> 00:03:01.640
 I do not have to worry about strengthening 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.349
 make a break before like how 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.959
 That's mostly the case with people 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:09.439
 who have really weak abdominal walls 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:11.000
 or just put a strong pressure on your stomach 

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:13.370
 as I said through blockages 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.780
 through a really really strong 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.069
 cough or stop at one 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.079
 pregnancy also in many 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:20.659
 pregnant women by this strong 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:21.680
 belly press a strip break one 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:23.419
 accordingly, we have to 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.090
 actually as a strength athlete as 

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:28.519
 regular athletes regularly 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.590
 Sports do not cause much concern 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:32.000
 but make a break of the strip but the 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.790
 exception confirms the times 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.959
 settle to 200 would like to know 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.489
 I would be interested in yours 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:38.720
 abdominal muscle training looks like me 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:39.950
 still have a little fat layer on 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.479
 belly and I heard that if you 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.220
 the abdominals exercise the 

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:45.260
 fat layer is pressed out and thus 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.269
 If you look even fatter, that's right 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.859
 Honestly that's the first time 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:50.479
 that I hear something like that when I am 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:52.299
 I still exercise my abdominal muscles 

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:54.739
 look thicker or the fat layer 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:57.229
 So is pushed out completely not you 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:04:00.229
 are not a toothpaste tube or something 

00:03:57.229 --> 00:04:01.840
 so it's more like that then that's me then 

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:04.609
 The belly fat is a bit different 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.019
 it can be good, but you can do it 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:06.530
 do not necessarily make you look fatter 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:09.409
 out 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.659
 the goal is to lose weight so now in 

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:13.280
 In your case, I think and thus 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:14.720
 to look a little more defined 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.190
 basically , of course, be said 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.720
 when exercising through his abdominal muscles 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.549
 Do not you accept it automatically? 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.440
 this area from the body always takes 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.970
 evenly off or on 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.770
 couple where he first decreases 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.630
 but you can not mine it 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.280
 Although can deliberately build up muddling but 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.610
 do not deliberately degrade that is whole 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.139
 important how does my abdominal muscles look 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.630
 routine out so basically i do 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:37.520
 not so much for the belly a 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:40.570
 Gym maybe a maximum 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.380
 two workouts a week 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:45.560
 really very easy 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:47.720
 belly training then I do that 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.430
 sit-ups or crunches like that 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.080
 a special abdominal machine in the 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.830
 gym and then the leg 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.450
 to lift 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.680
 but like I said that I would now 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:56.990
 not really as extras this 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.690
 describe abdominal muscle training with me 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.520
 then it's more like me twice 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:04.130
 sometimes three times a week 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:07.850
 around 4 55 to 60 minutes and afterwards 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:08.720
 then a little sixpack workout 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:09.950
 graduate from 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.889
 these are my four exercises 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:17.620
 start with the beetle then complete 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:20.330
 i sit-ups then i graduate the leg 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:23.360
 swing and then I still graduate 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:25.520
 the folding knives are four exercises then 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.290
 I usually do this 15 to 15 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.820
 20 repetitions sometimes stop too 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:31.160
 muscle failure depending on how I do 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:33.139
 I'm in a good mood and as I said that 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.280
 I graduate directly after the 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:35.780
 running unit 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.180
 usually at home at home 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.830
 I arrived or if I still 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.150
 times somehow there am I 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:44.540
 stop this one clap or something 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:45.710
 and then completed the workout and 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:47.620
 So far, I have done very well with it 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.160
 I do not have the megaspektakel right now 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.810
 not my goal 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:53.600
 and maybe that's one of them 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:55.400
 or other times try out unlocks 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.840
 I just want to know 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.550
 started with the fitness sport and 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.260
 I would like to know if I am a supplement 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.300
 normal protein powder or weight 

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.830
 gainer should use what the 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.419
 difference between politicians weight 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.430
 gainer protein powder the name suggests 

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:10.010
 a supplement for the most part 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:12.260
 Proteins mostly consist of 80 90 

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:14.840
 percent seen on 100 grams and it 

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:16.340
 it serves the muscles with nutrients 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:19.220
 to provide better and better care 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:20.419
 can regenerate faster than 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.300
 weight gainer as the name implies 

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:25.039
 a supplement that a weight gain 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:26.780
 simplify here it is the other way around 

00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:28.760
 here is the share of protein a lot 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:31.430
 less is the share of 

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:33.830
 carbohydrates higher and accordingly 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:37.340
 the weight gainer first, of course 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:39.340
 as an energy source around the body has with 

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:41.900
 to provide enough energy for 

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:43.789
 exhausting load such as 

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:45.440
 it is also a power sport they should do it 

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:47.630
 also simplify in calories 

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:49.700
 surplus so if you have it 

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:52.370
 really does not succeed 

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:54.110
 yes enough to feed then you can 

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:55.580
 now access his weight gainer and 

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:57.680
 so you make something easier in the 

00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:00.140
 mass phase and thus comes something 

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.400
 easier a calorie surplus in the 

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:03.770
 basic summer weight gainer actually 

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:05.900
 also nothing but a protein 

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:10.430
 Powder but stop with a lot 

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:12.470
 lower share of them now comes 

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:14.990
 Of course, on your goals, you want to 

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:16.610
 build strong mass and then yours 

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:17.510
 body really has energy 

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:20.090
 supply 

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:21.170
 with an excess of energy then 

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:21.800
 It can be a weight gainer 

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:23.780
 to grab 

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.790
 But do you already think I have small ones 

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:27.620
 grease or something in the 

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:28.970
 then it does a whole lot 

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:30.550
 normal routinecheck you do not have to 

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:31.760
 necessarily on a weight gainer 

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:33.740
 To fall back on 

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:35.210
 that 's it with this edition of fr
