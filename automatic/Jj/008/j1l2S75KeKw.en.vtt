00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 let's discuss this entertaining 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.200
 dishes like green is an hole here 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.929
 actually before us a bed and we will 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.269
 now all available to our party 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.969
 methods not afraid of the word fry 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.770
 night our same tank but it is special 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.590
 does not play a role because on complexity 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.930
 way damned and what else can we 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.510
 complexity 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:26.490
 therefore no one can tank 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.349
 we will play completely different 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.300
 in general, you can defeat it yourself 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.820
 brazilian only one way and this 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.130
 clamp in some dazable not 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.489
 let go until the very bitter end, and 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:41.670
 since we have a party paladin singing 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.980
 tank barbarian aggressive singing cypher and 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.160
 ranger as you understand from such a batch 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.140
 especially what designs you do not hold so 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.329
 we will play from the other as you see 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.300
 what we have done we accept cypher 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.760
 Martial 100 grams and our first singing 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.100
 Deal is still an additional plus 15 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.530
 the accuracy of this all parks will be plus 30 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.690
 but more precisely, the whole game will be from 15 o 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.020
 singing even additional tag 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.360
 total 30 0 other characters 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.640
 we are going of course to use these 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.150
 skins of fire service what kind of grill without 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:18.390
 you need to imitate it 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.880
 by treasure and now now here we are all in 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.130
 childhood Prague citizens well our tank he will 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.750
 hopes to live this difficult period we 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.290
 of course we can use something 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:32.220
 like something like scare her but 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.890
 the chances are not great now we are waiting for her 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.439
 Spends the day this good is done quickly 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.689
 and throw our first flower of paralysis 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.840
 who are wonderful like this scroll 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:45.240
 pravicha radius of 8 meters paralysis 15 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.000
 seconds accuracy plus 15 pines only 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.890
 this scroll and even initially 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.950
 characters like cypher have at least 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.409
 any chance of hitting this dragon 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.890
 because of her deviations as you can see 133 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:01.860
 and other defenses are far from best 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.680
 level that is now our our 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:08.640
 tank with one strike did him all there 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:12.120
 142 her army composition lazy damage and 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.490
 and we of course smear smear smear first 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.420
 scroll but nothing tank yet 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.330
 moved horses 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.420
 it means some nominally hope u 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:26.010
 he probably still has to apply first 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:30.480
 Mark it is interesting wait until 2 scroll 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:33.090
 flies here parovich seven seconds and it is not 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.730
 what you want the soul but not bad 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.130
 beginning in ethics him immediately following for 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.350
 fidelity for other members port cache 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.890
 and start using more and more and 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.180
 more paralysis is more accurate than paralysis and fire 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.280
 that's all that interests us 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:51.150
 and most importantly what we see in the course of the video 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:53.340
 that not only does paralysis keep the bed and 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.130
 doesn't let her do us any harm 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.769
 the main thing that he still allows it he 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.430
 lowers her reflexes to the level when all 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.530
 our 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.019
 for fighting spells inflicts on her 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.720
 crazy damage but not crazy 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:10.890
 of course but just give at least some 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:13.019
 chances that they will fall they will go away 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.150
 can open up to 116 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:17.459
 and without that all this accuracy which we 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.829
 we do not have any 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:22.019
 the slightest chance at all I'm even on 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:24.989
 a second to paralyze it was not 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:28.140
 inevitably enough and so on we continue 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:31.110
 want even more walls more walls 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.730
 this is understandable and is already worth it and here we want 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:36.209
 more fire 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:38.400
 that is, here we are trying to fry it in 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:42.209
 maxims giving the shortest possible time 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:46.200
 as fast as possible as fast as possible and 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:48.360
 so paralysis again missed radich again 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.890
 promo for why we throw another ingot 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.280
 as you see ivy 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:55.440
 Well, not that she sees just such 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.810
 that its not just going to carry 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:01.260
 reflex 34 does it mean to hit it 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:03.060
 any reflex debuff 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.320
 but in general any combat magic is very and 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.970
 very simple there of course 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.310
 reaction so we can apply 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.200
 ingot whirlwind if we donâ€™t feel sorry for him 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.060
 quite painful or we can 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.160
 just apply further and further and 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:18.980
 further, that is, well, it's still 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:21.709
 beats and yes it is already empty once that 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:23.470
 let's throw another fireball let's 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:26.210
 applicable 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:33.440
 we will wait while it such costs previous 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:36.770
 let's apply one more wall yes 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:43.220
 Of course, now the main thing is that the new 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:46.580
 paralysis got but it seems not hit him 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:49.610
 we have problems we have some problems 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.350
 but we don't give up we just use 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.970
 another ingot benefit is done 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:58.820
 quickly moisture is done quickly 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:01.550
 a lot is done quickly yes and oh there 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:04.010
 still there is contact there is contact now we 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:06.950
 Of course we want to just simply 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:07.850
 maximum speed throw all that u 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:11.060
 us left 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:13.070
 tanks see to us the lads run and and 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.140
 This is by the way very solid but fortunately 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:17.000
 we catch these all from dragans paralysis 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:19.910
 it is by the way incredibly important yes it is 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.850
 strategy because the main abominations here 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:24.530
 that these dragan know how to heal 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:26.630
 treat and of course we 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:29.660
 you see and so with great difficulty with 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:32.210
 with great difficulty and suffering shoot down 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:36.820
 unfortunate hit points and ears we are definitely not 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:41.480
 we want them to start pumping back 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:44.000
 after all back and so we throw also it seems 

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:49.630
 it seems like the end should be here 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:54.860
 near the end is close but if not now 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:57.350
 Our exhausted as our next 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:59.600
 we are because we are caught by our fans 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:02.570
 of course the wall of fire is she's all spa 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:06.710
 no memory hard wounds held too 

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:09.950
 Of course, too, for some reason , she too 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:11.870
 great damage is great but probably 

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:14.240
 need to use the frosty spell 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:15.919
 frosty scrolls image ingots but i 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.800
 just use what's at hand you just 

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:20.630
 than good in fact the wall of fire 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.520
 that they do permanent damage 

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:23.980
 it's kind of small but not for 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.610
 set very fast 

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:28.930
 pace and for the fact that they are very, very much 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:31.990
 places that's why this tactic and 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:34.540
 more or less acts so it is not 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:36.430
 Ideal for killing dragon 

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:39.550
 no spells at all but perfect 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:41.290
 specifically this tactic it fits well 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:44.410
 come on let's roll one more scroll 

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:47.710
 top of something it is something it is something 

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:50.740
 on resists excessively let's 

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:57.340
 Well, let's probably shoot for sure 

00:06:50.740 --> 00:07:00.490
 wanted a little hopeless everything that's all 

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:02.740
 dragon dragon is work for any party 

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:03.730
 Of course to get everyone there any more 

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:06.700
 for dragon 

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:08.860
 after the fights what are these three a fight on 

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:11.800
 we do after the kind of dragon wheels 

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:14.350
 12 party is all a matter of fact 

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:16.270
 getting ready to bed green video kashagane foot 

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:18.400
 confused by found see see 

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:19.240
 quivering will not work but all 

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:22.200
 happened 

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:22.200
 Good luck with your game
