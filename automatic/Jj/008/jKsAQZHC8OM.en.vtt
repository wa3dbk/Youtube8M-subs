hey everyone k safin here i'm here to
show<00:00:03.750> you<00:00:03.780> how<00:00:03.990> to<00:00:04.110> use<00:00:04.140> dynamic<00:00:04.529> signs

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
show you how to use dynamic signs

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.039 
show you how to use dynamic signs
because<00:00:05.490> i<00:00:05.670> thought<00:00:05.819> i'd<00:00:05.970> be<00:00:06.120> easier<00:00:06.480> to<00:00:06.540> use<00:00:07.020> a

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
because i thought i'd be easier to use a

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.440 
because i thought i'd be easier to use a
video<00:00:07.410> and<00:00:07.500> set<00:00:07.680> of<00:00:07.770> pictures<00:00:08.090> so<00:00:09.090> i'm<00:00:09.389> going

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
video and set of pictures so i'm going

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:10.520 
video and set of pictures so i'm going
to<00:00:09.570> tell<00:00:09.630> you<00:00:09.690> about<00:00:09.809> how<00:00:10.019> to<00:00:10.080> use<00:00:10.260> dynamic

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
to tell you about how to use dynamic

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.549 
to tell you about how to use dynamic
signs<00:00:11.070> for<00:00:11.370> items<00:00:11.670> and<00:00:11.940> the<00:00:12.630> two<00:00:12.840> new<00:00:13.080> dynamic

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
signs for items and the two new dynamic

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.849 
signs for items and the two new dynamic
signs<00:00:13.799> for<00:00:14.099> taxes<00:00:14.580> so<00:00:15.360> let's<00:00:15.570> get<00:00:15.690> started<00:00:15.859> so

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
signs for taxes so let's get started so

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.890 
signs for taxes so let's get started so
the<00:00:17.340> first<00:00:17.490> line<00:00:17.670> if<00:00:17.820> any<00:00:17.970> dynamic<00:00:18.210> sign<00:00:18.600> is

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
the first line if any dynamic sign is

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.040 
the first line if any dynamic sign is
you<00:00:19.560> guessed<00:00:19.770> it<00:00:19.949> dynamic<00:00:20.430> sign<00:00:20.779> for<00:00:21.779> item

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
you guessed it dynamic sign for item

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.960 
you guessed it dynamic sign for item
dynamic<00:00:22.470> signs<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:23.100> second<00:00:23.460> line<00:00:23.609> is<00:00:23.820> the

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
dynamic signs the second line is the

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.109 
dynamic signs the second line is the
item<00:00:24.180> name<00:00:24.390> somebody's<00:00:25.350> stone<00:00:25.619> as<00:00:25.769> my<00:00:25.890> example

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:26.119 
item name somebody's stone as my example

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.210 
item name somebody's stone as my example
the<00:00:27.119> third<00:00:27.330> line<00:00:27.539> is<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.810> property<00:00:28.230> so<00:00:28.920> we'll

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
the third line is the property so we'll

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.209 
the third line is the property so we'll
start<00:00:29.429> with<00:00:29.490> price<00:00:30.650> so<00:00:31.650> once<00:00:31.980> you<00:00:32.070> do<00:00:32.189> that

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
start with price so once you do that

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.090 
start with price so once you do that
dynamic<00:00:32.969> sign<00:00:33.149> generates<00:00:33.540> and<00:00:34.100> basically

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
dynamic sign generates and basically

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.770 
dynamic sign generates and basically
these<00:00:35.370> will<00:00:35.550> update<00:00:35.700> whenever<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.420> property

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
these will update whenever the property

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.229 
these will update whenever the property
changes<00:00:37.230> so<00:00:37.980> if<00:00:38.399> i<00:00:38.640> buy<00:00:39.329> five<00:00:40.290> stone<00:00:41.090> you<00:00:42.090> can

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
changes so if i buy five stone you can

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.180 
changes so if i buy five stone you can
see<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.510> price<00:00:42.719> change<00:00:43.079> by<00:00:43.379> five<00:00:43.620> cents<00:00:44.040> and

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
see the price change by five cents and

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.410 
see the price change by five cents and
the<00:00:44.879> price<00:00:45.329> itself<00:00:45.660> updated<00:00:46.289> if<00:00:47.100> i<00:00:47.340> sell<00:00:47.940> three

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
the price itself updated if i sell three

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.260 
the price itself updated if i sell three
stone<00:00:48.690> back<00:00:48.980> the<00:00:49.980> price<00:00:50.190> decrease<00:00:50.640> by<00:00:50.789> 3<00:00:51.030> cents

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
stone back the price decrease by 3 cents

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.600 
stone back the price decrease by 3 cents
and<00:00:51.559> you<00:00:52.559> can<00:00:52.710> see<00:00:52.890> that<00:00:52.920> happening<00:00:53.430> live

again<00:02:06.960> start<00:02:07.320> with<00:02:07.409> dynamic<00:02:07.770> sign<00:02:07.979> but<00:02:08.850> now

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
again start with dynamic sign but now

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.969 
again start with dynamic sign but now
only<00:02:09.600> the<00:02:09.780> second<00:02:10.259> line<00:02:10.380> is<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.619> one<00:02:10.649> will<00:02:10.890> be

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
only the second line is the one will be

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.240 
only the second line is the one will be
used<00:02:11.220> 34<00:02:11.880> will<00:02:12.030> be<00:02:12.120> blank<00:02:12.360> so<00:02:13.080> if<00:02:14.069> i<00:02:14.190> do
