Rob<00:02:07.710> just<00:02:08.100> a<00:02:08.220> Herculean<00:02:08.850> effort<00:02:09.390> by<00:02:09.929> a<00:02:09.959> true

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
Rob just a Herculean effort by a true

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.170 
Rob just a Herculean effort by a true
legend<00:02:10.679> he<00:02:10.860> made<00:02:11.009> a<00:02:11.039> huge<00:02:11.340> adjustment<00:02:11.550> went

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
legend he made a huge adjustment went

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.059 
legend he made a huge adjustment went
from<00:02:12.300> hugging<00:02:12.540> it<00:02:12.780> he<00:02:13.290> brought<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:13.890> heat

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
from hugging it he brought the heat

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:15.620 
from hugging it he brought the heat
moved<00:02:14.459> right<00:02:14.730> through<00:02:14.760> it<00:02:15.060> straight<00:02:15.420> and

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
moved right through it straight and

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.690 
moved right through it straight and
that's<00:02:16.260> what<00:02:16.470> one<00:02:16.650> of<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:16.860> match<00:02:17.040> but

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
that's what one of the match but

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.290 
that's what one of the match but

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
unfortunately he paid the price

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.960 
unfortunately he paid the price
so<00:02:21.960> it's<00:02:22.110> Mona<00:02:22.350> celli<00:02:22.680> versus<00:02:23.190> O'Neill<00:02:23.640> here's
