covers how I have mine connected but

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.170 
covers how I have mine connected but
there<00:01:44.350> are<00:01:44.530> so<00:01:44.920> many<00:01:45.100> different<00:01:45.280> ways<00:01:45.790> of

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
there are so many different ways of

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.780 
there are so many different ways of

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:52.660 
Dell Venue 8 Pro I would suggest that

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.890 
Dell Venue 8 Pro I would suggest that
you<00:01:52.780> use<00:01:52.900> a<00:01:52.990> Wi-Fi<00:01:53.440> printer<00:01:54.150> however<00:01:55.150> because

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
you use a Wi-Fi printer however because

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.360 
you use a Wi-Fi printer however because
it<00:01:56.170> makes<00:01:56.350> things<00:01:56.710> a<00:01:57.040> lot<00:01:57.550> simpler<00:01:58.060> as<00:01:59.370> default

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:00.370 
it makes things a lot simpler as default

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:05.970 
it makes things a lot simpler as default
the<00:02:01.950> Dell<00:02:02.950> Venue<00:02:03.400> 8<00:02:03.670> Pro<00:02:04.410> will<00:02:05.410> print<00:02:05.740> to<00:02:05.950> a

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:05.980 
the Dell Venue 8 Pro will print to a

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.089 
the Dell Venue 8 Pro will print to a
file<00:02:06.400> you<00:02:06.850> can<00:02:07.000> then<00:02:07.240> copy<00:02:07.660> that<00:02:07.960> file<00:02:08.259> to<00:02:08.440> a

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:09.099 
file you can then copy that file to a

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:12.089 
file you can then copy that file to a
USB<00:02:09.879> stick<00:02:10.119> for<00:02:10.660> instance<00:02:11.050> take<00:02:11.440> it<00:02:11.620> to<00:02:11.830> a
