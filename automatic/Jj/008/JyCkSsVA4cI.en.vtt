there's<00:00:02.070> been<00:00:02.220> quite<00:00:02.370> a<00:00:02.460> bit<00:00:02.520> of<00:00:02.669> discussion

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
there's been quite a bit of discussion

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.329 
there's been quite a bit of discussion
about<00:00:03.480> whether<00:00:03.899> or<00:00:04.080> not<00:00:04.230> it's<00:00:04.440> good<00:00:04.890> to<00:00:05.069> use<00:00:05.310> a

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
about whether or not it's good to use a

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.120 
about whether or not it's good to use a
shoulder<00:00:05.970> rest<00:00:06.299> and<00:00:06.680> there<00:00:07.680> are<00:00:07.799> certainly

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
shoulder rest and there are certainly

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.350 
shoulder rest and there are certainly
very<00:00:08.429> strong<00:00:09.240> feelings<00:00:09.690> on<00:00:09.840> either<00:00:10.019> side<00:00:11.360> what

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
very strong feelings on either side what

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.120 
very strong feelings on either side what
I<00:00:12.389> found<00:00:12.719> is<00:00:13.049> that<00:00:13.080> there's<00:00:13.469> been<00:00:13.650> relatively

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
I found is that there's been relatively

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.799 
I found is that there's been relatively
little<00:00:14.610> discussion<00:00:15.030> about<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.540> actual

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
little discussion about the actual

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.220 
little discussion about the actual
technique<00:00:16.529> of<00:00:16.740> playing<00:00:17.630> without<00:00:18.630> a<00:00:18.779> shoulder

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
technique of playing without a shoulder

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.710 
technique of playing without a shoulder
wrist<00:00:19.439> and<00:00:19.699> being<00:00:20.699> a<00:00:20.789> person<00:00:21.180> that<00:00:21.390> I've<00:00:21.570> been

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
wrist and being a person that I've been

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.480 
wrist and being a person that I've been
on<00:00:21.869> both<00:00:22.080> sides<00:00:22.320> I<00:00:22.650> played<00:00:22.890> most<00:00:23.100> of<00:00:23.160> my<00:00:23.250> life

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
on both sides I played most of my life

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.599 
on both sides I played most of my life
with<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.240> shoulder<00:00:24.570> rest<00:00:24.900> but<00:00:25.619> then<00:00:25.859> about<00:00:26.550> a

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
with a shoulder rest but then about a

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.130 
with a shoulder rest but then about a
year<00:00:26.910> ago<00:00:26.970> I<00:00:27.210> decided<00:00:27.599> to<00:00:27.840> give<00:00:27.990> up<00:00:28.109> my

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
year ago I decided to give up my

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.500 
year ago I decided to give up my
shoulder<00:00:28.470> rest<00:00:28.800> I<00:00:29.310> thought<00:00:30.179> it<00:00:30.300> would<00:00:30.420> be

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
shoulder rest I thought it would be

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.720 
shoulder rest I thought it would be
useful<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:30.990> sort<00:00:31.170> of<00:00:31.320> chronicle<00:00:31.859> some<00:00:32.579> of<00:00:32.669> the

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
useful to sort of chronicle some of the

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.060 
useful to sort of chronicle some of the
issues<00:00:32.850> that<00:00:33.090> I<00:00:33.300> faced<00:00:33.719> in<00:00:34.020> going<00:00:34.829> Restless

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
issues that I faced in going Restless

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.430 
issues that I faced in going Restless
and<00:00:35.600> some<00:00:36.600> of<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.780> techniques<00:00:37.050> that<00:00:37.230> I've

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
and some of the techniques that I've

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.119 
and some of the techniques that I've
used<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:38.540> to<00:00:39.540> play<00:00:40.140> without<00:00:40.410> a<00:00:40.559> shoulder<00:00:40.980> wrist

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
used to to play without a shoulder wrist

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.700 
used to to play without a shoulder wrist
so<00:00:41.760> first<00:00:42.059> off<00:00:42.239> I<00:00:42.420> wanted<00:00:42.719> to<00:00:42.870> maybe<00:00:43.260> talk<00:00:43.649> a

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
so first off I wanted to maybe talk a

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.590 
so first off I wanted to maybe talk a
little<00:00:43.980> bit<00:00:44.190> about<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.579> reasons<00:00:44.940> why<00:00:45.210> I

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
little bit about the reasons why I

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.900 
little bit about the reasons why I
decided<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.680> give<00:00:46.829> up<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.129> shoulder<00:00:47.430> wrist<00:00:47.610> now

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
decided to give up a shoulder wrist now

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.850 
decided to give up a shoulder wrist now

that you make any changes I'm just
discussing<00:00:53.870> some<00:00:54.870> of<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.020> issues<00:00:55.140> that<00:00:55.350> i

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
discussing some of the issues that i

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.590 
discussing some of the issues that i
personally<00:00:55.860> faced<00:00:57.500> so<00:00:58.699> this<00:00:59.699> is<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.969> standard<00:01:00.270> a

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
personally faced so this is a standard a

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.590 
personally faced so this is a standard a
coon<00:01:01.129> shoulder<00:01:02.129> rest<00:01:02.280> i<00:01:02.489> think<00:01:02.760> probably<00:01:03.420> a

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
coon shoulder rest i think probably a

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.539 
coon shoulder rest i think probably a
pretty<00:01:03.960> popular<00:01:04.260> one<00:01:04.739> that<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:05.100> lot<00:01:05.400> of<00:01:05.430> people

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
pretty popular one that a lot of people

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.010 
pretty popular one that a lot of people
use<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.979> clamps<00:01:07.979> onto<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.310> violin

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
use and clamps onto the violin

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.959 
use and clamps onto the violin
and<00:01:09.729> the<00:01:10.729> problem<00:01:10.969> that<00:01:11.210> I<00:01:11.390> had<00:01:11.750> was<00:01:12.969> lifting

00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:13.969 
and the problem that I had was lifting

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:16.360 
and the problem that I had was lifting
this<00:01:14.119> left<00:01:14.450> shoulder

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:16.370 
this left shoulder

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.330 
this left shoulder
I<00:01:16.460> found<00:01:17.000> that<00:01:17.210> for<00:01:17.750> me<00:01:17.900> personally<00:01:18.170> I<00:01:18.680> really

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
I found that for me personally I really

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.940 
I found that for me personally I really
was<00:01:19.940> not<00:01:20.120> capable<00:01:20.510> of<00:01:21.170> playing<00:01:21.500> without

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
was not capable of playing without

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.100 
was not capable of playing without
lifting<00:01:22.490> the<00:01:22.850> shoulder<00:01:23.240> I<00:01:23.270> found<00:01:23.690> that<00:01:23.840> I

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
lifting the shoulder I found that I

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.130 
lifting the shoulder I found that I
became<00:01:24.880> reliant<00:01:25.880> upon<00:01:26.030> having<00:01:26.840> the

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
became reliant upon having the

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.380 
became reliant upon having the
instrument<00:01:27.800> up<00:01:27.980> and<00:01:28.220> locked<00:01:28.610> in<00:01:28.820> the<00:01:28.910> position

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
instrument up and locked in the position

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.800 
instrument up and locked in the position
so<00:01:30.020> that<00:01:30.050> i<00:01:30.260> could<00:01:30.380> shift<00:01:30.710> freely<00:01:31.310> and<00:01:31.810> vibrate

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
so that i could shift freely and vibrate

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.370 
so that i could shift freely and vibrate
and<00:01:33.020> i<00:01:34.150> was<00:01:35.150> putting<00:01:35.480> a<00:01:35.630> lot<00:01:35.840> of<00:01:35.870> pressure<00:01:36.260> on

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
and i was putting a lot of pressure on

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.000 
and i was putting a lot of pressure on
the<00:01:36.650> chin<00:01:37.010> and<00:01:37.570> having<00:01:38.570> this<00:01:39.080> left<00:01:39.560> shoulder

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.010 
the chin and having this left shoulder

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.570 
the chin and having this left shoulder
come<00:01:40.400> up<00:01:40.760> like<00:01:41.030> so<00:01:41.390> and<00:01:42.010> i<00:01:43.010> just<00:01:43.220> was<00:01:43.430> not

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
come up like so and i just was not

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.820 
come up like so and i just was not
capable<00:01:43.880> of<00:01:44.330> playing<00:01:44.630> without<00:01:45.200> lifting<00:01:45.560> the

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
capable of playing without lifting the

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.070 
capable of playing without lifting the
shoulder<00:01:46.220> i<00:01:46.400> actually<00:01:46.880> I<00:01:47.120> had<00:01:47.510> a<00:01:47.540> lot<00:01:47.720> of<00:01:47.750> pain

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.080 
shoulder i actually I had a lot of pain

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.050 
shoulder i actually I had a lot of pain
in<00:01:48.230> my<00:01:48.350> shoulder<00:01:48.740> went<00:01:48.980> to<00:01:49.160> physical<00:01:49.610> therapy

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
in my shoulder went to physical therapy

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.020 
in my shoulder went to physical therapy
and<00:01:50.860> actually<00:01:51.860> was<00:01:52.010> able<00:01:52.130> to<00:01:52.370> overcome<00:01:52.820> a<00:01:52.880> lot

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
and actually was able to overcome a lot

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.690 
and actually was able to overcome a lot
of<00:01:53.270> the<00:01:53.360> pain<00:01:53.630> issues<00:01:53.840> but<00:01:54.800> still<00:01:55.160> I<00:01:55.190> had<00:01:55.460> a<00:01:55.490> lot

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
of the pain issues but still I had a lot

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.160 
of the pain issues but still I had a lot
of<00:01:55.730> tension<00:01:56.300> and<00:01:56.390> I<00:01:56.510> feel<00:01:56.690> like<00:01:56.810> the<00:01:56.990> tension

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
of tension and I feel like the tension

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.590 
of tension and I feel like the tension
was<00:01:57.560> kind<00:01:58.220> of<00:01:58.280> permeating<00:01:58.940> into<00:01:59.150> my<00:01:59.270> playing

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
was kind of permeating into my playing

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.230 
was kind of permeating into my playing
gave<00:02:00.350> me<00:02:00.530> a<00:02:00.560> kind<00:02:00.800> of<00:02:00.890> a<00:02:01.010> head<00:02:01.550> sound<00:02:01.940> my

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
gave me a kind of a head sound my

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.020 
gave me a kind of a head sound my
corrado<00:02:02.570> is<00:02:02.810> tense<00:02:03.140> it<00:02:03.770> didn't<00:02:04.640> have<00:02:04.790> the

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
corrado is tense it didn't have the

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.570 
corrado is tense it didn't have the
amplitude<00:02:05.900> that<00:02:06.140> I<00:02:06.170> wanted<00:02:06.560> because<00:02:06.890> I<00:02:06.950> my

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
amplitude that I wanted because I my

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.080 
amplitude that I wanted because I my
fingers<00:02:07.970> were<00:02:08.210> too<00:02:08.690> tense<00:02:09.350> and

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
fingers were too tense and

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.600 
fingers were too tense and
you<00:02:10.660> need<00:02:10.840> to<00:02:11.019> really<00:02:11.349> to<00:02:11.800> be<00:02:12.250> able<00:02:12.310> to<00:02:12.459> get<00:02:12.580> a

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
you need to really to be able to get a

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:13.890 
you need to really to be able to get a
good<00:02:12.790> athlete<00:02:13.150> to<00:02:13.269> it<00:02:13.390> on<00:02:13.480> your<00:02:13.629> on<00:02:13.870> your

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
good athlete to it on your on your

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.630 
good athlete to it on your on your
vibrato<00:02:14.170> you<00:02:14.680> need<00:02:14.830> to<00:02:14.920> have<00:02:15.069> these<00:02:15.220> fingers

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
vibrato you need to have these fingers

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.509 
vibrato you need to have these fingers
loose<00:02:15.940> and<00:02:16.980> be<00:02:17.980> able<00:02:18.099> to<00:02:18.330> wobble<00:02:19.330> them<00:02:19.629> like<00:02:19.840> so

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
loose and be able to wobble them like so

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:24.479 
loose and be able to wobble them like so
so<00:02:21.519> that's<00:02:22.000> the<00:02:22.150> reason<00:02:22.180> why<00:02:22.450> I<00:02:23.190> decided<00:02:24.190> to

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
so that's the reason why I decided to

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:26.850 
so that's the reason why I decided to
give<00:02:24.730> up<00:02:24.760> the<00:02:25.000> shoulder<00:02:25.330> rest<00:02:25.510> now<00:02:26.110> at<00:02:26.650> some

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
give up the shoulder rest now at some

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.470 
give up the shoulder rest now at some
point<00:02:27.099> in<00:02:27.190> time<00:02:27.220> I<00:02:27.400> may<00:02:27.670> go<00:02:27.849> back<00:02:28.060> it<00:02:28.330> actually

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
point in time I may go back it actually

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.300 
point in time I may go back it actually
is<00:02:28.810> a<00:02:28.840> lot<00:02:29.140> easier<00:02:29.410> to<00:02:29.680> play<00:02:29.950> with<00:02:30.220> the

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
is a lot easier to play with the

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.640 
is a lot easier to play with the
shoulder<00:02:30.640> risk<00:02:30.879> because<00:02:31.299> the<00:02:31.629> violence<00:02:32.379> sits

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
shoulder risk because the violence sits

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.619 
shoulder risk because the violence sits
up<00:02:32.830> and<00:02:33.069> you<00:02:33.340> don't<00:02:33.519> feel<00:02:33.730> like<00:02:33.790> you're<00:02:34.450> ready

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:34.629 
up and you don't feel like you're ready

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:38.220 
up and you don't feel like you're ready
to<00:02:34.810> drop<00:02:35.080> it<00:02:35.319> and<00:02:35.940> it<00:02:36.940> really<00:02:37.269> is<00:02:37.510> easier<00:02:38.170> to

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
to drop it and it really is easier to

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.750 
to drop it and it really is easier to
shift<00:02:38.680> you<00:02:38.890> don't<00:02:39.069> have<00:02:39.160> to<00:02:39.280> worry<00:02:39.459> so<00:02:39.549> much

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
shift you don't have to worry so much

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.309 
shift you don't have to worry so much
about<00:02:39.910> supporting<00:02:40.599> the<00:02:40.750> instrument<00:02:41.170> you<00:02:41.260> can

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
about supporting the instrument you can

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.339 
about supporting the instrument you can
move<00:02:42.069> up<00:02:42.280> into<00:02:42.459> high<00:02:42.670> positions<00:02:43.269> and<00:02:43.569> or<00:02:44.019> shift

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 
move up into high positions and or shift

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:47.699 
move up into high positions and or shift
up<00:02:44.500> and<00:02:44.680> down<00:02:44.860> and<00:02:44.890> vibrate<00:02:45.610> but<00:02:46.329> again<00:02:47.319> for<00:02:47.560> me

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
up and down and vibrate but again for me

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.470 
up and down and vibrate but again for me
as<00:02:47.920> soon<00:02:48.099> as<00:02:48.190> I<00:02:48.310> put<00:02:48.579> on<00:02:48.670> your<00:02:48.819> shoulder<00:02:49.120> rest<00:02:49.239> I

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
as soon as I put on your shoulder rest I

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.759 
as soon as I put on your shoulder rest I
feel<00:02:50.290> this<00:02:50.500> left<00:02:50.829> shoulder<00:02:51.280> going<00:02:52.090> up<00:02:52.360> and

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
feel this left shoulder going up and

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:56.400 
feel this left shoulder going up and
even<00:02:53.769> now<00:02:54.239> playing<00:02:55.239> about<00:02:55.569> a<00:02:55.599> year<00:02:55.959> without<00:02:56.170> us

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
even now playing about a year without us

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.319 
even now playing about a year without us
without<00:02:56.739> a<00:02:56.920> shoulder<00:02:57.310> rest<00:02:57.459> I<00:02:57.700> still<00:02:58.090> have

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
without a shoulder rest I still have

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:01.680 
without a shoulder rest I still have
that<00:02:58.799> temptation<00:02:59.799> to<00:03:00.190> sort<00:03:00.459> of<00:03:00.549> lift<00:03:01.329> up<00:03:01.540> this

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
that temptation to sort of lift up this

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.130 
that temptation to sort of lift up this
left<00:03:02.019> side<00:03:02.230> and<00:03:02.849> cause<00:03:03.849> a<00:03:03.879> lot<00:03:04.239> of<00:03:04.269> tension<00:03:04.840> in

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
left side and cause a lot of tension in

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.590 
left side and cause a lot of tension in
my<00:03:05.319> playing
