00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.219 
destiny in WWE and the story was written
a<00:01:55.950> bit<00:01:56.130> differently<00:01:56.549> how<00:01:57.210> would<00:01:57.479> this<00:01:57.899> story

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
a bit differently how would this story

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.690 
a bit differently how would this story
have<00:01:58.439> been<00:01:58.590> written<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:59.340> would<00:01:59.460> have<00:01:59.549> been

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
have been written it would have been

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.459 
have been written it would have been
pretty<00:02:00.570> much<00:02:00.689> what<00:02:00.869> I<00:02:00.899> was<00:02:00.990> doing<00:02:01.200> at<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.320> end

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
pretty much what I was doing at the end

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.510 
pretty much what I was doing at the end
there<00:02:01.740> in<00:02:02.100> ECW<00:02:02.460> you<00:02:02.880> know<00:02:02.969> I<00:02:03.649> for<00:02:04.649> a<00:02:04.829> long<00:02:05.159> time

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
there in ECW you know I for a long time

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.210

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
was trying to get myself moved to ECW

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.740 
was trying to get myself moved to ECW
because<00:02:08.729> I<00:02:08.819> felt<00:02:09.090> like<00:02:09.149> I<00:02:09.360> could<00:02:09.509> kind<00:02:09.660> of

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
because I felt like I could kind of

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.750 
because I felt like I could kind of
break<00:02:09.929> out<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:10.319> actually<00:02:10.709> do<00:02:11.039> something<00:02:11.520> I

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
break out and actually do something I

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.200 
break out and actually do something I
got<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.510> chance<00:02:12.750> to

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
got the chance to

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.960 
got the chance to
no<00:02:13.330> and<00:02:13.660> but<00:02:14.230> never<00:02:14.560> really<00:02:15.100> had<00:02:15.670> it<00:02:15.700> follow

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
no and but never really had it follow

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.370 
no and but never really had it follow
through<00:02:16.330> with<00:02:16.510> and<00:02:16.690> you<00:02:16.780> know<00:02:16.840> this<00:02:16.990> stuff<00:02:17.230> I

through with and you know this stuff I

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.050 
through with and you know this stuff I
could<00:02:17.590> have<00:02:17.680> done<00:02:17.980> differently<00:02:18.040> you<00:02:19.030> know

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
could have done differently you know

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.640 
could have done differently you know
different<00:02:19.480> you<00:02:19.540> know<00:02:19.690> you<00:02:20.140> always<00:02:20.290> look<00:02:20.470> back

done that differently or something you
know<00:02:23.980> it<00:02:24.220> would<00:02:24.340> have<00:02:24.400> been<00:02:24.520> slightly

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
know it would have been slightly

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.820 
know it would have been slightly
different<00:02:24.910> but<00:02:25.390> then<00:02:25.540> I<00:02:25.750> always<00:02:26.200> felt<00:02:26.530> like<00:02:26.650> I

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
I guess if work rate in WWE was was was

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.610

one
I<00:04:26.550> don't<00:04:27.300> think<00:04:27.360> British<00:04:27.690> wrestling<00:04:27.990> is<00:04:28.139> such

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350
