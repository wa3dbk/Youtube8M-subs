00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.870 

some<00:01:10.200> time<00:01:10.409> later<00:01:10.439> this<00:01:11.010> is<00:01:11.070> probably<00:01:11.670> from

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
some time later this is probably from

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:19.609 
some time later this is probably from
around<00:01:13.670> 2001<00:01:14.670> or<00:01:15.030> 2002<00:01:17.540> here's<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.720> most

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
around 2001 or 2002 here's the most

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.210 
around 2001 or 2002 here's the most
modern<00:01:20.070> design<00:01:20.340> which<00:01:20.610> came<00:01:20.820> out<00:01:20.850> in<00:01:21.180> the

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
modern design which came out in the

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:28.580 
modern design which came out in the
around<00:01:23.220> 2008<00:01:24.060> I<00:01:24.330> would<00:01:24.720> suppose<00:01:27.350> so<00:01:28.350> let's

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
around 2008 I would suppose so let's

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.219 
around 2008 I would suppose so let's
give<00:01:28.799> it<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:28.950> try<00:01:29.100> here<00:01:32.630> let<00:01:33.630> me<00:01:33.689> see<00:01:33.869> something

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
give it a try here let me see something

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:40.880 
give it a try here let me see something
yeah<00:01:35.159> used<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.729> be<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:35.850> twist-off<00:01:39.740> still<00:01:40.740> is<00:01:40.860> a

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
yeah used to be a twist-off still is a

00:01:40.890 --> 00:02:01.730 
yeah used to be a twist-off still is a
twist-off<00:01:41.369> it<00:01:41.549> just<00:01:41.729> wouldn't<00:01:42.000> twist<00:01:42.210> off

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
past the aroma is very faint almost

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:54.690

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.589 

sort<00:02:55.540> of<00:02:55.599> watery<00:02:56.020> watery<00:02:56.890> aroma<00:02:57.489> give<00:02:58.390> it<00:02:58.510> a

00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599 
sort of watery watery aroma give it a

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:07.900 
sort of watery watery aroma give it a
taste<00:02:58.840> here

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.940 

that's<00:03:08.690> a<00:03:08.780> lot<00:03:08.930> richer<00:03:09.260> taste<00:03:09.470> in<00:03:09.650> what<00:03:09.830> you

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
that's a lot richer taste in what you

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.810 
that's a lot richer taste in what you
would<00:03:10.100> think<00:03:10.220> it<00:03:10.370> would<00:03:10.460> have<00:03:10.610> from<00:03:10.730> the<00:03:10.880> aroma

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
would think it would have from the aroma

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:19.450 
would think it would have from the aroma
you<00:03:13.820> can<00:03:14.710> taste<00:03:15.710> the<00:03:17.230> the<00:03:18.230> grains<00:03:18.590> and<00:03:19.070> it's

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:19.460 
you can taste the the grains and it's

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:22.660 
you can taste the the grains and it's
hard<00:03:19.730> to<00:03:19.820> tell<00:03:20.030> what<00:03:20.270> it<00:03:20.360> is<00:03:21.100> but<00:03:22.100> as<00:03:22.280> a<00:03:22.310> beer

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
hard to tell what it is but as a beer

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.400 
hard to tell what it is but as a beer
taste<00:03:23.120> but<00:03:23.330> it's<00:03:23.480> a<00:03:23.570> pretty<00:03:23.840> good<00:03:24.020> amount<00:03:24.290> of

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
taste but it's a pretty good amount of

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.750 
taste but it's a pretty good amount of
hop<00:03:24.680> bitterness<00:03:25.580> to<00:03:26.030> this<00:03:26.210> beer<00:03:27.020> on<00:03:27.710> the<00:03:28.430> under

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
mild it's a darker beer and if you're

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:37.510 
mild it's a darker beer and if you're
