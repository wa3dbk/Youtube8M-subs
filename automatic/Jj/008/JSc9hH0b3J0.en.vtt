00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.449 
food processor if you guys don't have
that<00:02:42.440> I'm<00:02:42.590> sure<00:02:42.739> a<00:02:42.769> blender<00:02:43.159> would<00:02:43.250> work<00:02:43.430> just

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
that I'm sure a blender would work just

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.280 
that I'm sure a blender would work just
as<00:02:43.760> good<00:02:43.790> or<00:02:44.180> you<00:02:44.420> can<00:02:44.569> just<00:02:44.780> take<00:02:45.019> something

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
as good or you can just take something

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.050 
as good or you can just take something
and<00:02:45.379> start<00:02:45.560> mashing<00:02:45.739> it<00:02:46.040> up<00:02:46.099> to<00:02:46.310> get<00:02:46.400> it<00:02:46.549> a<00:02:46.700> nice

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
and start mashing it up to get it a nice

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:57.220 
and start mashing it up to get it a nice
consistency<00:02:53.530> so<00:02:54.910> that's<00:02:55.910> how<00:02:56.690> much<00:02:56.840> of<00:02:57.110> the

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
consistency so that's how much of the

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.539 
consistency so that's how much of the
papaya<00:02:57.530> I'm<00:02:57.590> going<00:02:57.709> to<00:02:57.769> use<00:02:57.920> I'm<00:02:58.160> going<00:02:58.220> to<00:02:58.400> eat

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
the rest of that so we don't let it go

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:00.280
