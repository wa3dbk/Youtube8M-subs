00:00:03.029 --> 00:00:09.460
 I have answered a very good partner 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:11.759
 partner if it is a re between good and 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:14.139
 good is it looks good actually i'm going to 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.059
 I will present before from here from 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:20.380
 madrid but then we're leaving right away 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:22.630
 to brazil and clear it is a turn for 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.180
 I say no we are not typical is already in 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.580
 the plate spends the time very fast in 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.320
 Brazil is everything very exciting 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.730
 and it's very funny then with 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.589
 many more you want I already wanted to 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.629
 come back because he is also missing 

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:36.789
 I'm used to not stopping anymore 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:38.859
 I missed it a little but still 

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:46.120
 with more desire to be in this event not 

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:47.800
 it remains only I am sincere we have already 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.420
 completed is what you said hand I know 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.100
 that there will be a team that logically 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.350
 will come back because we will not need to 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.510
 all there because many of us cover the 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.999
 part of Spain let's say glued to 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.370
 the selection then I do not know who 

00:00:57.999 --> 00:01:01.929
 will decide in this case jota and manu that 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.960
 come back and who will stay that will be that 

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:06.390
 you should see it and study it 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.020
 ah 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.580
 Well, it's positive, very positive, because 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.729
 I said as he said fearful camacho 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.590
 be the rival to beat the main 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.119
 goal of all the selections because 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.460
 they are going to make it very difficult for me 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.310
 I do not know how in the end the quality of 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.320
 players from spain always get 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.940
 get positive results and 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.310
 this year I hope it's the same I have 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.900
 very good feeling is also the same 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.280
 generation has practically not yet 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.460
 gone that generational change of players 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.650
 follow the base of the Euro Cups won 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.720
 and the world cup achieved and that gives me 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.770
 good very good thorn together with 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.990
 new additions that always 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.160
 they can add a lot talking about fear 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.840
 this year 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.320
 There are many conflicts in Brazil as 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.200
 journalist how are you going to face 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.180
 well, trusting that no 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.620
 interfere our work at least what 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.690
 less possible it is true that it is there not 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.070
 you can not forget it you can not 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.440
 look the other way because when 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.630
 We went to the stadiums, you saw many 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.520
 Sometimes we could not arrive in time for 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.860
 because there were cuts in the streets and 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.560
 but as he said hand is a 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.450
 social problem is a pity that a 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.490
 event of these characteristics is not 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.870
 all positive and the people of the country a lot 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.090
 people are not happy but we 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:20.290
 we will work for in this case to 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.290
 our television for mediaset 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.650
 and we are going to concentrate on our 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:32.670
 work and try to affect us what 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.670
 less possible what happens around 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.430
 every hour you dedicate to the one you're going to 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.720
 dedicate all this month to work I 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.930
 I imagine that the following months how 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.950
 you are going to do to combine it 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.930
 to reconcile it with life 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.420
 with your life more personal good then in 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.800
 principle I clear in principle as 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.660
 I always say it like almost all 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.700
 mothers of the world that is not a case 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.940
 different to all women 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.489
 they organize because we are sobradamente 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:00.349
 prepared in this case I will leave here the 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:02.810
 baby at the beginning especially so 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:05.450
 unless I'm going to work and well, it's 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.519
 one thing of mine to organize myself facing 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.950
 keep going but I 'm going to work 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:11.360
 I've been traveling with my friends for five years 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.730
 companions and it's going to be exactly the same 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.660
 and being here well attended will be 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.040
 going back to the subject of journalism 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.480
 anything you say is always 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.069
 ends up becoming a trending topic or 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.410
 You see yourself in criticism that as you live 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:23.569
 as a good teacher is that I'm not 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.120
 very pending the truth is that we are 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:29.180
 here for that is not so we will not hold 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.799
 criticism so much rose us in the 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.349
 good head or sank us 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:35.030
 bad we will dedicate ourselves to something else not 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:36.950
 we are exposed and well I every time 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.470
 I wear better I think that like everything 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.090
 is relativized more time to concentrate on 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.290
 what are you doing what are you trying to do 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.330
 you're still learning, I'm still 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.800
 preparing and good 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:49.540
 and I do not take it badly the truth is that 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.540
 try not to affect clear 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:56.680
 well a great match 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.780
 I think he had it all he did not have this 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.000
 emotion to the end that surprise in 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:06.270
 the minute 93 that already very few people 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.270
 I was expecting then it's very exciting 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.130
 that if you can then make a little trip 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.130
 To celebrate 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:19.540
 in principle we will all return because if 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.100
 you have to celebrate it precisely with 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.300
 more will motivate you to go back to prepare a 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.850
 super deployment as we have done 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:27.580
 always and to cover it as the occasion 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.960
 he deserves it and then we'll see we do not know 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.960
 I really have no idea what 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:34.230
 I'm going to do and beyond 13 14 of 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.230
 July
