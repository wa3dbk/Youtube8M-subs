00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
assuming the other camera on the other

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.179 
assuming the other camera on the other
side<00:00:07.109> was<00:00:07.230> probably<00:00:07.440> the<00:00:07.529> final<00:00:07.680> final<00:00:08.069> boss

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189

in<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.330> first<00:00:12.509> game<00:00:12.690> like<00:00:13.500> a<00:00:13.530> flashback<00:00:13.920> to

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
in the first game like a flashback to

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.980
