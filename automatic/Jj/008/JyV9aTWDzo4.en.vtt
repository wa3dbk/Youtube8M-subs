well he came for ok this morning Nikki a

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.700 
well he came for ok this morning Nikki a
trained<00:01:59.790> and<00:02:00.060> which<00:02:00.780> was<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:00.990> bonus<00:02:01.439> you<00:02:01.469> know

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710

he<00:02:01.799> went<00:02:01.950> down<00:02:02.100> with<00:02:02.280> a<00:02:02.310> bit<00:02:02.430> of<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.579> hamstring<00:02:02.759> I

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
he went down with a bit of a hamstring I

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.840 
he went down with a bit of a hamstring I
think<00:02:04.560> he<00:02:04.619> was<00:02:04.710> probably<00:02:04.829> a<00:02:05.040> bit<00:02:05.189> fatigued<00:02:05.640> in

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
think he was probably a bit fatigued in

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.580 
think he was probably a bit fatigued in
although<00:02:06.000> he<00:02:06.149> was<00:02:06.509> probably<00:02:06.689> tired<00:02:07.049> and<00:02:07.439> just

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
although he was probably tired and just

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.210 
although he was probably tired and just
started<00:02:08.009> to<00:02:08.099> feel<00:02:08.340> it<00:02:08.520> a<00:02:08.550> little<00:02:08.700> bit

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
started to feel it a little bit

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.550 
started to feel it a little bit
crap<00:02:09.940> water<00:02:10.180> and<00:02:10.330> a<00:02:10.390> hamstring<00:02:10.750> but<00:02:10.990> certainly

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
crap water and a hamstring but certainly

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.040 
crap water and a hamstring but certainly
at<00:02:12.490> first<00:02:12.880> we<00:02:13.060> thought<00:02:13.090> it<00:02:13.300> was<00:02:13.540> a<00:02:13.570> hamstring

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
at first we thought it was a hamstring

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.880 
at first we thought it was a hamstring
that<00:02:14.260> it<00:02:14.380> did<00:02:15.280> tweet<00:02:15.640> but<00:02:16.330> no<00:02:17.320> reaction<00:02:17.770> is

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
that it did tweet but no reaction is

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.520 
that it did tweet but no reaction is
small<00:02:18.100> in<00:02:18.310> so<00:02:18.930> hopefully<00:02:19.930> no<00:02:20.080> reaction<00:02:20.500> from

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
small in so hopefully no reaction from

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.560 
small in so hopefully no reaction from
the<00:02:20.740> smallest<00:02:21.100> training<00:02:21.550> and<00:02:21.760> it<00:02:22.270> could<00:02:22.450> be

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
the smallest training and it could be

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.590 
the smallest training and it could be
okay<00:02:22.870> every<00:02:23.530> chance<00:02:23.800> i<00:02:24.160> think<00:02:24.790> the<00:02:24.880> points<00:02:25.480> are

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
okay every chance i think the points are

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.660 
okay every chance i think the points are
