00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.340
 We still have an internet 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:13.049
 now last but not least donkey kong 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:16.870
 country tropical fries yes for the riu 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.700
 again in 1080p years that günther 

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:21.460
 Bücking country returns was for the 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:24.190
 again , of course, looks very accurate 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.530
 also like zelda crisp as sharp 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:28.750
 mario kart 8 so you have to go there 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:30.940
 let the eu right so the graphic is 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.770
 really nice very colorful one can the 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:36.010
 but say really crisp 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.630
 So really great markus was great 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.940
 So I say my list is new 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.520
 litter of donkey kong country old 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.410
 known principle 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.690
 donkey kong is on his way with his 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.040
 buddy diddy kong i mean yes 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.590
 that you come back thick now 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.270
 play again eight euros is the 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.770
 I'm pretty sure blond hair 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.300
 that is not always on it 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.330
 picture yes this on top of the picture with 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.610
 while dixie kong is probably so quasi 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.360
 as a supporting force for donkey kong 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.790
 be there 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.680
 at country could indeed the itself 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.950
 yes, the bayer does not play that way either 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.390
 jetpack help and see such a junk 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.390
 almost the same way 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.150
 Recycle the audience quite nicely 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.780
 I played then can to 3ds 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.210
 played 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.910
 oh yes, voted on the 3ds eight mega 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.140
 mega mega stubborn to love my serious 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.960
 I'm looking forward to the titles 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.490
 how cool 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.510
 that is also a novelty of now 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:33.640
 the double fries that you almost in the 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.380
 space shoots in with the one with 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.119
 the cantons before so more in the 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.470
 background but had the camera 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:39.640
 now follow one as you do 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.470
 can see very nice here 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.869
 honestly, pretty cool for me 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.270
 because you only wear my hands 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:48.369
 properly put the level in and that 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.440
 I've also been nice 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.970
 can but look now even skim yes 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.170
 probably still comes to vettel sign 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.649
 taken directly whipped 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.030
 very nice because the pose without shit 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.270
 So as I said from the gameplay ago 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.520
 as well as donkey kong country returns 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.720
 nice graphics when exactly because itself 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.160
 Personally , not exactly 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.660
 I will definitely enjoy playing 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.649
 let us know if we have the error of 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.280
 do not know exactly 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.150
 maybe it has a bump on it 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.870
 survived we are still here 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:19.570
 nintendo's super mario 3d world has had 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.820
 but in principle the same as for the 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.440
 3ds stop as you can see now 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.690
 can with better graphics and so on 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.030
 and so on, that's not happening now 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.920
 that's why we say goodbye 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.430
 now yes from the nintendo I am 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.410
 curious; excited 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.530
 we do not have the link with them now 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.300
 seen 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.300
 as I thought I'm doing my view
