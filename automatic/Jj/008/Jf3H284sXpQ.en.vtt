first<00:00:13.049> of<00:00:13.170> all<00:00:13.320> in<00:00:14.070> calibrating<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:15.299> air<00:00:15.509> sees

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:17.150 
first of all in calibrating the air sees

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.330 
first of all in calibrating the air sees
what<00:00:18.150> I<00:00:18.180> did<00:00:18.449> was<00:00:18.600> taking<00:00:19.050> out<00:00:19.140> channel<00:00:20.010> number

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
what I did was taking out channel number

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.550 
what I did was taking out channel number
three<00:00:20.880> being<00:00:21.420> that<00:00:21.570> that<00:00:21.660> was<00:00:21.810> my<00:00:21.990> throttle

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
three being that that was my throttle

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.910 
three being that that was my throttle
Channel<00:00:23.359> and<00:00:24.359> I<00:00:24.449> took<00:00:24.510> take<00:00:25.109> out<00:00:26.750> individually

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:27.920 
Channel and I took take out individually

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.209 
Channel and I took take out individually
your<00:00:28.920> motors<00:00:29.310> so<00:00:29.970> one<00:00:30.210> two<00:00:30.480> three<00:00:30.510> four<00:00:31.219> put

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
your motors so one two three four put

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.549 
your motors so one two three four put
that<00:00:32.369> into<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.910> receiving<00:00:33.540> pin<00:00:33.870> of<00:00:34.170> the

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
that into the receiving pin of the

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:44.119 
that into the receiving pin of the
throttle<00:00:37.250> and<00:00:38.250> go<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.520> your<00:00:38.670> radio<00:00:42.920> have<00:00:43.920> that

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
throttle and go to your radio have that

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:55.540 
throttle and go to your radio have that
on<00:00:46.520> then<00:00:47.520> go<00:00:47.850> into<00:00:49.129> max<00:00:50.129> throttle<00:00:50.640> now<00:00:53.180> when

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
on then go into max throttle now when

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.599 
on then go into max throttle now when
this<00:00:56.550> powers<00:00:57.059> up<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.390> will<00:00:57.510> hear<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.809> normal

00:00:58.599 --> 00:00:58.609 
this powers up you will hear the normal

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:01.340 
this powers up you will hear the normal
ESC<00:00:59.609> chiming<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.480> then<00:01:00.750> you'll<00:01:00.899> hear<00:01:01.109> this

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
ESC chiming and then you'll hear this

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.849 
ESC chiming and then you'll hear this
motor

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
motor

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.860 
motor
whichever<00:01:02.340> motor<00:01:02.579> you're<00:01:02.760> doing<00:01:03.059> will<00:01:03.719> be<00:01:03.840> a

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
whichever motor you're doing will be a

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.410 
whichever motor you're doing will be a
longer<00:01:04.320> time<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:05.189> will<00:01:05.369> finish<00:01:05.580> after<00:01:06.240> these

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
longer time it will finish after these

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.880 
longer time it will finish after these
ones<00:01:06.689> and<00:01:06.960> all<00:01:07.110> sound<00:01:07.530> different<00:01:09.740> that's<00:01:10.740> when

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
ones and all sound different that's when

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:22.630 
ones and all sound different that's when
you<00:01:10.979> know<00:01:11.100> it's<00:01:11.130> gone<00:01:11.430> into<00:01:12.090> programming<00:01:12.930> mode

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.999 

so<00:01:23.640> with<00:01:24.000> that<00:01:24.240> then<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:25.259> goes<00:01:25.530> through<00:01:25.560> these

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
so with that then it goes through these

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.700 
so with that then it goes through these
series<00:01:26.430> of<00:01:26.460> beeps<00:01:26.840> each<00:01:27.840> beep<00:01:28.380> is<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.740> menu<00:01:30.710> it

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
series of beeps each beep is a menu it

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.100 
series of beeps each beep is a menu it
goes<00:01:31.890> into<00:01:32.070> its<00:01:32.280> submenu<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.540> way<00:01:33.720> I<00:01:33.750> worked

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
goes into its submenu the way I worked

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.020 
goes into its submenu the way I worked
out<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.470> submenu<00:01:35.100> was<00:01:35.250> off<00:01:35.400> of<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.610> Emacs

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
out the submenu was off of the Emacs

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.240 
out the submenu was off of the Emacs
site<00:01:36.360> where<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.049> has<00:01:37.259> what<00:01:37.650> each<00:01:37.740> program

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
site where it has what each program

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.950 
site where it has what each program
number<00:01:38.640> is<00:01:40.280> basically<00:01:41.280> throttle<00:01:41.939> is<00:01:42.240> charm

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
number is basically throttle is charm

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:51.440 
number is basically throttle is charm
number<00:01:43.290> three<00:01:45.170> so<00:01:46.170> we'll<00:01:46.290> do<00:01:46.409> that<00:01:46.439> first

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.389 

stick<00:01:52.229> down<00:01:52.500> within<00:01:52.829> two<00:01:53.039> seconds<00:01:55.189> now<00:01:56.189> what<00:01:56.369> I

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
stick down within two seconds now what I

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.429 
stick down within two seconds now what I
found<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.850> first<00:01:57.060> off<00:01:57.270> is<00:01:57.450> with<00:01:57.630> my<00:01:57.780> trim<00:01:58.079> set

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
found the first off is with my trim set

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.709 
found the first off is with my trim set
at<00:01:58.649> zero<00:01:58.979> I<00:01:59.430> didn't<00:02:00.149> get<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.420> minimum

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
at zero I didn't get the minimum

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.899 
at zero I didn't get the minimum
throttle<00:02:01.170> so<00:02:01.560> I<00:02:01.619> gradually<00:02:02.039> kept<00:02:02.429> going<00:02:02.729> down

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
throttle so I gradually kept going down

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.679 
throttle so I gradually kept going down
on<00:02:03.090> my<00:02:03.210> trim<00:02:03.770> then<00:02:04.770> I'm<00:02:04.860> not<00:02:04.979> to<00:02:05.100> about<00:02:05.399> 20<00:02:06.329> out

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
on my trim then I'm not to about 20 out

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:19.380 
on my trim then I'm not to about 20 out
of<00:02:06.750> 30

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.360 

so<00:02:20.390> what<00:02:20.540> I<00:02:20.569> did<00:02:20.750> is<00:02:21.050> I<00:02:21.200> set<00:02:21.530> everything<00:02:21.709> to<00:02:22.069> off

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
so what I did is I set everything to off

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.699 
so what I did is I set everything to off
it<00:02:23.000> says<00:02:23.360> that<00:02:23.540> it<00:02:23.629> should<00:02:23.840> be<00:02:23.989> that<00:02:24.110> factory

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
it says that it should be that factory

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.350 
it says that it should be that factory
but<00:02:24.920> mine<00:02:25.190> weren't<00:02:25.810> so<00:02:26.810> each<00:02:27.170> of<00:02:27.200> these<00:02:27.470> beeps

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
but mine weren't so each of these beeps

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:36.160 
but mine weren't so each of these beeps
is<00:02:29.360> the<00:02:29.690> different<00:02:31.239> timing<00:02:32.239> marks<00:02:33.200> so<00:02:33.739> I<00:02:35.170> left

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
is the different timing marks so I left

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.630 
is the different timing marks so I left
mine<00:02:36.440> it<00:02:36.590> off<00:02:36.769> which<00:02:37.040> is<00:02:37.190> the<00:02:37.220> first<00:02:37.370> beep<00:02:39.640> so

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
mine it off which is the first beep so

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.210 
mine it off which is the first beep so
we'll<00:02:40.790> go<00:02:40.940> through<00:02:41.239> these<00:02:41.830> we<00:02:42.830> can<00:02:42.950> hear<00:02:43.129> the

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
we'll go through these we can hear the

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.800 
we'll go through these we can hear the
first<00:02:43.459> beep<00:02:43.760> within<00:02:44.030> two<00:02:44.209> seconds<00:02:44.599> you<00:02:44.690> go

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
first beep within two seconds you go

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:52.420 
first beep within two seconds you go
full-throttle<00:02:46.360> I'll<00:02:47.360> just<00:02:47.540> wait<00:02:47.720> for<00:02:47.840> up<00:02:51.430> ok

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
full-throttle I'll just wait for up ok

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.020 
full-throttle I'll just wait for up ok
that's<00:02:52.610> to<00:02:52.880> go<00:02:53.209> around<00:02:53.420> again

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
that's to go around again

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.199 
that's to go around again
there'll<00:02:56.030> be<00:02:56.060> four<00:02:56.329> options<00:02:57.700> so<00:02:58.700> the<00:02:58.819> next<00:02:59.000> one

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
there'll be four options so the next one

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:09.300 
there'll be four options so the next one
just<00:02:59.920> go<00:03:00.920> up<00:03:01.810> down

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.390 

that's<00:03:10.310> that<00:03:10.519> motor<00:03:10.760> calibrated<00:03:12.129> then<00:03:13.129> I<00:03:13.220> went

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
that's that motor calibrated then I went

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.910 
that's that motor calibrated then I went
through<00:03:13.640> individually<00:03:14.329> as<00:03:14.720> I<00:03:15.530> did<00:03:15.739> the<00:03:15.829> each

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
through individually as I did the each

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.729 
through individually as I did the each
step<00:03:16.220> there<00:03:16.629> programmed<00:03:17.629> them<00:03:19.599> the<00:03:20.620> it<00:03:21.620> was

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
step there programmed them the it was

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:23.559 
step there programmed them the it was
okay<00:03:22.099> to<00:03:22.160> put<00:03:22.459> both<00:03:22.700> power<00:03:23.030> and<00:03:23.209> everything<00:03:23.389> to

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:23.569 
okay to put both power and everything to

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:25.840
