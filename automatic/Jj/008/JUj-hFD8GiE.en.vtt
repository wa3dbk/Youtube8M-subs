00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.640 

that's<00:01:03.100> cool<00:01:03.550> it<00:01:03.790> smokes<00:01:04.330> it's<00:01:04.870> burning<00:01:05.440> off

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:05.650 
that's cool it smokes it's burning off

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.800 
that's cool it smokes it's burning off
the<00:01:05.680> residual<00:01:06.610> engine<00:01:06.940> oil<00:01:07.090> it's<00:01:07.330> left<00:01:07.570> in<00:01:07.720> the

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
the residual engine oil it's left in the

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.340 
the residual engine oil it's left in the
combustion<00:01:08.229> chamber<00:01:08.440> I<00:01:09.540> OHE<00:01:10.540> back<00:01:10.930> to<00:01:11.110> choke

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
combustion chamber I OHE back to choke

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.680 
combustion chamber I OHE back to choke
all<00:01:11.560> the<00:01:11.650> way<00:01:11.770> off<00:01:12.010> during<00:01:12.430> that<00:01:12.610> just<00:01:13.330> giving

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:13.690

all the way off during that just giving
them<00:01:13.780> a<00:01:13.810> little<00:01:13.960> show<00:01:14.259> I<00:01:14.500> gave<00:01:14.710> it<00:01:14.830> a<00:01:14.860> little

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979 
them a little show I gave it a little

00:01:14.979 --> 00:02:24.470 
them a little show I gave it a little
pump<00:01:15.280> on<00:01:15.520> a<00:01:15.610> fuel<00:01:15.880> fall

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:33.470 

oh<00:02:29.299> fun<00:02:30.299> oh<00:02:31.040> my<00:02:32.040> having<00:02:32.400> fun<00:02:32.640> now<00:02:33.090> i'm<00:02:33.239> going<00:02:33.390> to

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
oh fun oh my having fun now i'm going to

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.119 
oh fun oh my having fun now i'm going to
start<00:02:33.870> up<00:02:34.049> again<00:02:34.170> i<00:02:34.349> basically<00:02:34.709> want<00:02:34.830> to<00:02:35.010> get

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129 
start up again i basically want to get

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:36.949 
start up again i basically want to get
up<00:02:35.310> to<00:02:35.459> operating<00:02:35.760> temperature<00:02:36.030> I<00:02:36.629> want<00:02:36.840> to

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
up to operating temperature I want to

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.270 
up to operating temperature I want to
make<00:02:37.080> sure<00:02:37.110> that<00:02:37.500> that<00:02:37.530> little<00:02:37.890> fuel

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
make sure that that little fuel

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.339 
make sure that that little fuel
stabilizer<00:02:38.640> make<00:02:39.239> sure<00:02:39.420> we<00:02:39.510> put<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:39.870> gas<00:02:40.080> tank

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
stabilizer make sure we put the gas tank

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.410 
stabilizer make sure we put the gas tank
is<00:02:40.530> through<00:02:40.769> the<00:02:40.890> whole<00:02:41.099> fuel<00:02:41.489> system<00:02:41.940> so<00:02:42.390> we

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
is through the whole fuel system so we

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.900 
is through the whole fuel system so we
drained<00:02:42.930> it<00:02:43.049> out<00:02:43.170> any<00:02:43.470> residual<00:02:44.069> fuel<00:02:44.400> left<00:02:44.700> in

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
drained it out any residual fuel left in

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.630 
drained it out any residual fuel left in
there<00:02:45.150> indeed<00:02:45.959> has<00:02:46.349> stabilizer<00:02:47.040> in<00:02:47.310> it<00:02:47.430> which

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
there indeed has stabilizer in it which

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.750 
there indeed has stabilizer in it which
I<00:02:47.940> feel<00:02:48.750> in<00:02:48.900> my<00:02:48.930> head<00:02:49.260> helps<00:02:49.500> out<00:02:49.799> so<00:02:50.430> let's<00:02:50.610> get

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
I feel in my head helps out so let's get

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.280 
I feel in my head helps out so let's get
us<00:02:50.910> started<00:02:51.150> up<00:02:51.420> again<00:02:51.510> and<00:02:51.780> bring<00:02:51.959> her<00:02:52.079> up<00:02:52.170> to

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
us started up again and bring her up to

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.410 
us started up again and bring her up to
operating<00:02:52.650> temperature<00:02:52.940> and<00:02:53.940> I'm<00:02:54.239> going<00:02:54.390> to

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
operating temperature and I'm going to

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.149 
operating temperature and I'm going to
idle<00:02:54.750> it<00:02:54.840> down<00:02:55.019> but<00:02:55.290> I<00:02:55.349> just<00:02:55.560> wanted<00:02:55.799> to<00:02:55.890> get<00:02:56.040> up

00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:56.159 
idle it down but I just wanted to get up

00:02:56.159 --> 00:03:00.020 
idle it down but I just wanted to get up
to<00:02:56.340> operating<00:02:56.579> temperature<00:02:58.760> this<00:02:59.760> actually

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
to operating temperature this actually

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.000 
to operating temperature this actually
might<00:03:00.450> be<00:03:00.660> an<00:03:00.780> effect<00:03:01.170> of<00:03:01.379> that<00:03:01.560> fuel

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
might be an effect of that fuel

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.920 
might be an effect of that fuel
stabilize<00:03:02.700> it<00:03:02.940> is<00:03:03.030> actually<00:03:03.269> in<00:03:03.569> the<00:03:03.660> fuel

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
stabilize it is actually in the fuel

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.900 
stabilize it is actually in the fuel
that<00:03:04.109> you<00:03:04.290> don't<00:03:04.470> want<00:03:04.650> a<00:03:04.709> perfectly<00:03:05.459> idle<00:03:05.790> but

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
that you don't want a perfectly idle but

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.069 
that you don't want a perfectly idle but
it<00:03:06.000> also<00:03:06.150> might<00:03:06.390> be<00:03:06.599> that<00:03:06.750> it's<00:03:06.930> not

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
it also might be that it's not

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:09.050 
it also might be that it's not
completely<00:03:07.799> warmed<00:03:08.190> up<00:03:08.430> yet<00:03:08.609> so<00:03:08.819> we're<00:03:08.940> going

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
completely warmed up yet so we're going

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.380 
completely warmed up yet so we're going
to<00:03:09.150> give<00:03:09.269> her<00:03:09.390> a<00:03:09.450> little<00:03:09.690> more<00:03:10.579> warming<00:03:11.579> up<00:03:11.700> so

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
to give her a little more warming up so

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.059 
to give her a little more warming up so
a<00:03:12.420> couple<00:03:12.810> of<00:03:13.019> pumps<00:03:13.230> on<00:03:13.470> a<00:03:13.500> fuel<00:03:13.799> bowl<00:03:14.040> a

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
a couple of pumps on a fuel bowl a

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.190 
a couple of pumps on a fuel bowl a
little<00:03:14.519> bit<00:03:14.640> of<00:03:14.760> show<00:03:14.970> get<00:03:15.420> that<00:03:15.599> throttle<00:03:15.959> up

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
little bit of show get that throttle up

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.440 
little bit of show get that throttle up
there
