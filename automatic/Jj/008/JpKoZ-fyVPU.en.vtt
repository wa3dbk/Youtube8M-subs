00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 very good morning friends welcome in the 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.850
 kitchen with frame last week we have 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.069
 I learned how to make a good cake 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.170
 vanilla if they missed the recipe les 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.150
 I leave the link here below if you do not want it 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.179
 do can also buy ready - made 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.460
 but he warned him that he will not get rich 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.680
 soft and fluffy as what is necessary 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.750
 to us good today I love him 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.820
 teach how to transform this rich 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.740
 Vanilla sponge cake in a delicious 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.740
 strawberry and cream cake 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:33.850
 what we are going to need is a sponge cake 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:35.620
 of vanilla of 23 centimeters one kilo and 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.680
 half of strawberries the juice of an orange 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:41.790
 a liter of milk cream to assemble and 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.790
 4 tablespoons of sugar 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.309
 very well the first thing we have to 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.440
 to do is cut our cake in three 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.420
 parts and the top part did not come out 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.820
 perfectly flat do not worry 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.930
 because now we can cut him and 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.930
 make it uniform 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.509
 very good now that we already have plague 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.060
 we can continue cutting the second one 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:13.890
 second state 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.869
 to make it easier I advise you 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.970
 use a knife that is as long as 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:23.730
 this with a larger wing 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.730
 it will be easier to follow a line 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.860
 well once we cut 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.740
 three different parts we are going to put 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.780
 next to 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.340
 will be ready for later and now 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.110
 we take our wonderful strawberries and 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.110
 We are going to wash it well under water 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.810
 now that we have washed our strawberries 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.700
 let's choose some of them more 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.680
 pretty to leave next to 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.540
 decorate 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.790
 perfect that may be enough 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.280
 Now we're going to cut all the rest 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.230
 in very small pieces each of 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.750
 we are going to remove the green part 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.790
 because this is not eaten when they cut 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.430
 something that is not that round and moves 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.740
 but the council cut it in half 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.440
 and they put it on the part they cut 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.920
 down this way is the stop will be easier 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.920
 cut 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.590
 now that we have finished cutting 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:26.050
 all our strawberries we also put 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.050
 the juice of an orange 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:33.570
 and also four tablespoons of sugar 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.570
 we are going to remove everything 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.270
 perfect now things better is 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.100

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.440
 us and we put them electric 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.110

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.319

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:56.420

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.500

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:09.310

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.890
 perfect now with the cream we are going to 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:21.190
 coat over and around the edges 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:25.980
 the whole cake 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.980
 let's make a very very thin stand 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.830
 I want to show you how I made the cake 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:55.210
 as you can see I did a coating 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:57.130
 external of very simple cream not thick and 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:00.639
 it's not important that the whole cake be 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:03.220
 completely covered although if you see 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:07.570
 a little cupcake downstairs because now 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:09.370

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:12.130
 of hero pill we take from this manga 2 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.990
 and 0 and we put it in the cream that 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:15.520
 we have assembled if in the house does not have a 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.220
 pill mania do not worry 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.949
 They can use a plastic bag 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:26.250
 quite large where you have a 

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:26.250
 angle and make out lanata out there 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:33.689

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.689

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:40.050

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:43.360
 coated a little better our cake 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:46.550

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:49.070
 programming peace and zero over 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:51.990

 list now before you cut it 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:21.289

 in the freezer for at least one 

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:25.939
