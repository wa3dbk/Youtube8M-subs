00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:12.229 
know we got to stay hopeful and

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:15.219 
know we got to stay hopeful and
hopefully<00:05:13.220> they<00:05:13.430> will<00:05:13.580> keep<00:05:13.789> some<00:05:14.360> BL

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:15.229 
hopefully they will keep some BL

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:18.070 
hopefully they will keep some BL
elements<00:05:15.979> I<00:05:16.190> don't<00:05:16.460> really<00:05:16.880> care<00:05:17.419> if<00:05:17.479> there's

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 
elements I don't really care if there's

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.339 
elements I don't really care if there's
no<00:05:18.320> smut<00:05:18.740> honestly<00:05:19.570> that's<00:05:20.570> not<00:05:20.780> why<00:05:20.900> I<00:05:20.930> played

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:21.349 
no smut honestly that's not why I played

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:24.820 
no smut honestly that's not why I played
the<00:05:21.560> game<00:05:21.800> the<00:05:22.720> bottom<00:05:23.720> line<00:05:23.900> is<00:05:24.229> that<00:05:24.530> we<00:05:24.710> will

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:24.830 
the game the bottom line is that we will

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:28.180 
the game the bottom line is that we will
have<00:05:24.979> to<00:05:25.099> wait<00:05:25.220> and<00:05:25.370> see<00:05:25.479> again<00:05:26.860> we<00:05:27.860> have<00:05:28.039> to

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.190 
have to wait and see again we have to

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:29.710 
have to wait and see again we have to
hope<00:05:28.370> that<00:05:28.639> it<00:05:28.789> won't<00:05:29.000> be<00:05:29.210> an<00:05:29.300> unmitigated

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 
hope that it won't be an unmitigated

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.710 
hope that it won't be an unmitigated
disaster<00:05:30.430> it's<00:05:31.430> not<00:05:31.789> going<00:05:32.090> to<00:05:32.180> be<00:05:32.270> the<00:05:32.419> same

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 
disaster it's not going to be the same

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.870 
disaster it's not going to be the same
but<00:05:33.650> I<00:05:33.680> think<00:05:33.950> if<00:05:34.070> you<00:05:34.160> want<00:05:34.370> something<00:05:34.760> that

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:34.880 
but I think if you want something that

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.600 
but I think if you want something that
is<00:05:35.060> the<00:05:35.330> same<00:05:35.570> as<00:05:35.840> the<00:05:36.200> visual<00:05:36.380> novel<00:05:36.710> your

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:37.610 
is the same as the visual novel your

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:40.379 
is the same as the visual novel your
best<00:05:37.849> bet<00:05:38.150> is<00:05:38.300> to<00:05:38.389> play<00:05:39.020> the<00:05:39.289> visual<00:05:39.770> novel

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:40.389 
best bet is to play the visual novel

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:42.820 
best bet is to play the visual novel
because<00:05:41.389> it's<00:05:41.570> never<00:05:41.750> gonna<00:05:41.870> be<00:05:42.020> exactly<00:05:42.500> the

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:42.830 
because it's never gonna be exactly the

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:47.219 
because it's never gonna be exactly the
same<00:05:42.860> so<00:05:43.700> my<00:05:43.970> final<00:05:44.419> verdict<00:05:44.810> is<00:05:45.050> I<00:05:45.950> am<00:05:46.400> wary

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:47.229 
same so my final verdict is I am wary

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:52.719 
same so my final verdict is I am wary
but<00:05:48.250> hopeful<00:05:49.450> ultimately<00:05:50.450> I'm<00:05:50.840> hopeful<00:05:51.729> let's

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:52.729 
but hopeful ultimately I'm hopeful let's

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:55.780 
but hopeful ultimately I'm hopeful let's
all<00:05:52.969> together<00:05:53.960> cross<00:05:54.590> our<00:05:54.770> fingers
