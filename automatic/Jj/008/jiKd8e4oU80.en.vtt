00:00:07.679 --> 00:00:11.409
 would you be your eleven meter deep 14 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:13.989
 also like to shoot like this one 

00:00:11.409 --> 00:00:15.249
 just or here or something like that 

00:00:13.989 --> 00:00:16.780
 Goalkeeper jumping in the right corner 

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:19.150
 like here but the ball anyway 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:20.650
 does not hold exactly the same here or 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.570
 just once with him post a 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.400
 then you should pop this 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.840
 following tutorial video look for 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.330
 I explain exactly how to do it 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:31.330
 such eleven meters placed so well and 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.739
 Nevertheless, very safe shooting can therefore 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.870
 definitely train those eleven meters 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:36.670
 I want to have you first 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.620
 show where you can do that best 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.659
 this recording is still on the demo 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.510
 but you will also be in the full version 

00:00:40.659 --> 00:00:45.609
 the subsection training arena in the menu 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.280
 like here and there you can find 

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:49.780
 create a standard with select now 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.399
 in the demo is just not yet 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.319
 if you like this video during the 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:54.850
 demo looks then just runs like me 

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:56.440
 Make it in the criminal area and here 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.870
 pushes control stick to the left or 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.600
 right and then you come in any case 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.039
 also in this eleven meter menu as 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.750
 next, it is important that you 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:07.180
 understands mechanics behind the eleven meters 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.800
 every eleven has a goal to look for 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.990
 you can not see that in the game but 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.240
 In training, you could use the l2 key 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.800
 then turn it on and off 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.630
 This target seeker you can with the 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.100
 move left stick and thus yours 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.570
 eleven meters place how to do that now 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.130
 here in the background with a few 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.870
 Examples can see where the help to 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.270
 is and on that our system builds 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.710
 for placed eleven also on and that 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.580
 whole is divided again in three 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.710
 steps 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.270
 First, it is important that you have the 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.640
 Sucher is left down in the corner 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.650
 located in the green area meets the 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.360
 means as soon as this white panel what 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.280
 always goes back and forth in this green 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.740
 area is pushing the shot button 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.110
 and the more green area in it 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.330
 the closer you are to eleven meters 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.580
 Second, the shot strength 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.410
 your elfmeters the longer you shot 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.910
 button pressed holds harder 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.220
 Shoot yourself also the elfmeter 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.590
 but the less accurate is also the 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.560
 eleven meters so I would recommend approx 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.729
 Charge 50 percent of the beam because 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.180
 then your shot comes with one 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:06.020
 Mixture of placed haid and starch 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.330
 Now comes the decisive moment 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.979
 namely the right timing was the beginning 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.660
 to aim with the left stick 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.670
 after you have the firepower with the 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.130
 shot button and have charged this 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.930
 let go you must directly afterwards 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.300
 start to aim with the left stick 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.430
 You need a minimal break between 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.750
 Release the shot button and start 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.670
 to aim with the left stick 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.650
 about as long until the shot button 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.970
 she is completely dislocated again 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.290
 make a little noise and then 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.830
 he starts with the left stick 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.120
 aim 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.980
 you can see that here in the example 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.570
 very nice I let the shot button 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.940
 los start with the left stick 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.769
 Attract and the target curve moves 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.390
 in the corner and makes the gate 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:43.010
 the nice thing about this method is that 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.660
 her left stick to aim at 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.430
 do not need to let go because of the 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.780
 body eventually stops itself 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.820
 to move because the shooter the 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.739
 shot already means that means you 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.480
 you can just push through to the end 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.190
 and if the timing is correct when aiming 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.530
 was then the shot still not 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.390
 over in these two scenes 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.880
 once again parallel to the scene the 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.489
 correct sequence at the controller shot 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.800
 Reload aiming and the goal 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.450
 you should have problems with it 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.950
 that your shots go past the gate 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.630
 if you by pushing the left stick as 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.940
 in this example then you have something 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.440
 should start later to aim his 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.000
 conclusions about being placed in the wrong place, like in 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.830
 this example then you have something 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.310
 start earlier with the left stick too 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:20.900
 pull 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.060
 Now I want to explain you 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.190
 which further variation of shots 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.690
 there is still the eleven meters on the one hand 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.880
 we have the cut shot there 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.739
 This is done in the one while you 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.110
 he once shot the penalty 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.760
 this shot is a little more accurate 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.010
 that means the goal is a little bit 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.300
 smaller but that's the shot too 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.590
 weaker and the goalkeeper can him 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.140
 hold better when a court 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.360
 the corner is next we have the 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.739
 Just swap for it while you shoot 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.150
 Hold down l1 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:48.440
 the objective is then a little 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.569
 limited one can only one piece 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.310
 to the left or right but sees 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:54.019
 quite nice if you meet as 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.430
 Lastly, there is the possibility that 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:56.989
 delay a bit 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.940
 or the shot at 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:00.830
 fooling so much that makes you 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.360
 simply by running while you're on 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.250
 after getting the shot 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.260
 key pressed for the shot 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.239
 to reload briefly the shot 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.620
 key at the tip during startup and 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:12.230
 then the player delays a short time 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.640
 bit and then shoot at this 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.560
 Variant one has the advantage that one 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.120
 possibly from time to time can see in which 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.370
 The goalie jumps when he does 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.169
 has decided earlier but on 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.669
 The other side will be the target search 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:24.080
 also much faster that is called the 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:26.419
 body moves faster it gets 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.430
 harder to pull right into the corner and 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:29.660
 the animal window will be bigger too 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.620
 is a bit the problem with 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.990
 this variant 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.700
 that would have been so far for this 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.650
 tutorial I hope you enjoyed it 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.610
 and her account is learning something 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.620
 best directly on the training course 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.479
 because it is really very valuable 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.160
 if you shoot eleven meters so placed 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:44.810
 that one also has a chance one 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.850
 Goal to shoot if the goalkeeper in the 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:49.310
 right corner jumps and then the ball 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:51.020
 nevertheless not get as I said 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.610
 goes to the training ground does that 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.110
 I would say we'll see each other 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.380
 Until next time I wish you 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:59.270
 Have a nice day and welcome 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.050
 Welcome and more beautiful turned on 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:04.300
 has become a new one 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:06.480
 and to a tutorial video one 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.480
