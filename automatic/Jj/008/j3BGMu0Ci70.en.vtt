00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:14.240
 and my mother had finished coag to the 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:17.550
 just returned from a football game 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:20.390
 and it's very cool and you can put it 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.390
 felt pens 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.230
 Well, I 'm going to explain how 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.940
 makes the koala pencil holder the first thing is 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.190
 Draw the koala or the animal that you 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.200
 you want to do on a quiet sheet 

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:35.550
 because I'm going to leave the template as 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.310
 always to download in the link that 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.750
 there is below in the description of the video 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:42.360
 this would be the government template 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.950
 draw your wave prints and cut them 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.660
 how am I doing now we are going to 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.090
 cut out the pieces that we then go to 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.220
 transfer to rubber eva you can do it 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.320
 also with cardboard but the rubber eva 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.600
 it lasts a lot longer and it's easier 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.370
 to clean will also be more durable 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.010
 your koala and if it gets wet it does not happen 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.720
 nothing here I have the pieces that then 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.550
 they would be placed you see the legs the arms 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.580
 the hair that is here on the chest 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:11.140
 good head all the pieces the 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.140
 hind legs nose 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:17.480
 and the eyes of the legs I have drawn 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:20.390
 one because you can do it twice and 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:22.880
 the arm also fine well now we're going to 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:26.060
 go transferring these pieces to eva rubber 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:29.080
 I'm going to use two shades of gray like 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.080
 you are seeing in these pieces 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.170
 you see in the part clarita nothing more I'm going to 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.420
 place the hair on the chest and the leg on 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.280
 foot what would be the foot and in the gray 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.920
 dark as you see the centerpiece of 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.080
 body the head the arms and 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.970
 legs or legs 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.560
 then I simply place it and draw 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.630
 the chop with a marker for later 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.700
 cut them out 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.560
 it's always easier and better to do it in 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.149
 paper and then pass the silhouette because if 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.130
 we were wrong to mark in the rubber eva 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:00.190
 and then it does not work for us, we have to 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:03.870
 throw and it's more expensive than paper 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.870
 we cut the pieces 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.200
 and we are going to reserve them 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.640
 in the clear part I draw two legs with 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.440
 the same template what would be the 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.440
 feet to understand us in the clear part 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.490
 the hair that leads in the front 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.090
 of the chest 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:27.760
 under the head 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.489
 and cut as before 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:34.230
 with white color with white eva rubber or 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.230
 family that you also call of one 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:40.120
 let's make the eyes 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.400
 I make two equal 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.769
 with a little bit of blue made simply 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.450
 a smaller oval for the iris and with 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:49.209
 black another even smaller for 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:53.099
 pupils and mouth the little piece of the mouth 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.099
 I'm going to do it with pink foami 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:58.670
 here it is 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.870
 now for the patitas drawn and what 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.430
 I'm going to do by hand you can cut the 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.990
 template also if you want are the 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.180
 little fingers 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.910
 the part of the internal of the ears 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.250
 It also goes in pink and when you have already 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:13.620
 all the pieces we are going to measure the tin 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:16.200
 let's use a can of canning 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.670
 and we're going to line it up with rubber eva that 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.739
 I'm going to make light gray what 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.500
 can you make any other color is 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.970
 where will the koala go? 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.989
 make brown that simulates a tree by 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.989
 example or green 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:33.220
 well then I cut the size of the can 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.110
 so I do not have anything to cover it 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.120
 enterita 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.500
 You can also paint the can if you want 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.010
 or put any can that you already have 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.010
 decorated 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:46.480
 you see here stuck I'm going to cut out a 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:50.530
 little bit more than a little bit I check 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:52.480
 that's fine and I'm going to paste it 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.610
 If you do not have a can you can use a 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.950
 glass jar or also some of 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:00.260
 plastic if you want but with a can is 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:03.230
 more durable and does not break 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.840
 with hot or cold silicone or a 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.420
 very strong glue I will go placing 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.090
 the rubber eva off around me to 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.069
 cover all my can 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:15.060
 the felling the washing is previously 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:17.320
 obviously clean of any food 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.609
 these cans are the normal ones that 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.730
 they use canning that is in the 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.650
 supermarkets 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.970
 you can make the size you want there 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.190
 also bigger cans that are worth you 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.740
 perfectly now I'm going to stick in the 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.630
 back of the body that was this 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.490
 gray piece starting from the part of 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.050
 down the can what would remain 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.090
 table 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.470
 and now we're going to stick the pieces in 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.569
 the head before placing the head 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.389
 placed the inner part of the ears 

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:44.099
 pink inside the ears the nose and 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:47.930
 is that it is so oval black nose 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:51.050
 of which the mouth is very large 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:54.100
 the white part of the eye stuck to the 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.100
 nose as you are seeing 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:59.929
 the blue iris and the black pupil 

00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:01.129
 also made a few tight colors 

00:04:59.929 --> 00:05:03.080
 black to give you a little more 

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:05.090
 expression to the koala you can paint them with 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.520
 marker if you want 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:10.639
 on the legs you can see the little fingers or 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.410
 pillows put 3 and the part of the 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:14.630
 palm what would be the equivalent to 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:16.560
 our palm or the plant of the 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:19.130
 foot 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:23.070
 Well, here I already have these pieces assembled 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:26.460
 to open them by sticking in their place the 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:29.900
 little hairs of the chest would go here placed 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.900
 head over 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:34.849
 You see is a little stuck in the can and 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:38.209
 I will place now 

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:41.289
 the arms held to the can I put a 

00:05:38.209 --> 00:05:43.419
 little bit of glue from behind 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:45.689
 just behind the body or inside if 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:47.729
 you want so they do not look 

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:49.439
 the little legs and well here in front I'm going to 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:50.429
 put some glue on the tip 

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:53.749
 on the edge so they remain 

00:05:50.429 --> 00:05:53.749
 protruding a little populated 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:57.570
 I put more glue the little hand so that 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:59.160
 It seems like he grabs the can so he can 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:01.140
 hold there with the little hands a little 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.910
 open and now I have legs 

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:07.110
 backs that would be placed from the 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:09.750
 leg from the fish to the body 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:13.190
 would be the thighs so call it I do not know 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:13.190
 if they have another name in animals 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:22.940
 put a little more glue and already 

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:25.220
 we would have our pencil holder ready in 

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:27.260
 Koala shape how the return to the 

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:28.910
 cole I recommend you watch this video of 

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:31.130
 how to make a case with a bottle 

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:33.230
 of cocacola in my friend's channel 

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:34.700
 Isabel of easy ideas I leave the link 

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:36.560
 down in the description of the video for 

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:38.720
 that you go directly and know that 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:42.400
 it's a channel that I love now 

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:44.949
 let's see some fake shots with mateo 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:48.660
 and you can place it with your other 

00:06:44.949 --> 00:06:48.660
 pencils like these 

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:52.999
 scissors 

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:57.389
 hollis the network 

00:06:52.999 --> 00:06:59.240
 brushes of everything and in the red you can 

00:06:57.389 --> 00:07:02.120
 come like this 

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:04.639
