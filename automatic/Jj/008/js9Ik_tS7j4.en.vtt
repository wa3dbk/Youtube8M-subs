another<00:00:45.899> 20<00:00:46.350> more<00:00:46.559> that<00:00:46.739> would<00:00:46.829> be<00:00:46.920> hatching

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
another 20 more that would be hatching

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.330 
another 20 more that would be hatching
by<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.430> end<00:00:47.579> of<00:00:47.640> next<00:00:47.700> month<00:00:48.059> so<00:00:49.050> here<00:00:49.739> is<00:00:49.980> the

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
by the end of next month so here is the

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.729 
by the end of next month so here is the
baby<00:00:50.780> babies<00:00:51.780> cool<00:00:52.050> because<00:00:52.260> it<00:00:52.500> literally

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
baby babies cool because it literally

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.560 
baby babies cool because it literally
has<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.010> combination<00:00:53.699> of<00:00:53.789> both<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.180> mother<00:00:54.449> and

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
has a combination of both the mother and

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.020 
has a combination of both the mother and
father<00:00:55.170> in<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:56.219> I<00:00:56.340> mean<00:00:56.579> obviously<00:00:56.670> that's

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
father in it I mean obviously that's

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.040 
father in it I mean obviously that's
just<00:00:57.210> what<00:00:57.360> happens<00:00:57.629> when<00:00:57.690> you<00:00:57.840> breathe

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
just what happens when you breathe

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.660 
just what happens when you breathe
through<00:00:58.079> animals<00:00:58.530> together<00:00:58.620> but<00:00:59.070> this<00:00:59.430> one

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
through animals together but this one

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.950 
through animals together but this one
actually<00:01:00.649> contains<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:02.059> nice<00:01:03.769> pinstripe<00:01:04.769> that

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
actually contains of nice pinstripe that

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.080 
actually contains of nice pinstripe that
and<00:01:06.960> it<00:01:07.350> will<00:01:07.439> start<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:07.979> develop<00:01:08.189> as<00:01:08.580> it<00:01:08.700> gets

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
and it will start to develop as it gets

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.760 
and it will start to develop as it gets
older<00:01:09.330> I<00:01:09.360> can<00:01:09.570> see<00:01:09.780> that<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.080> Rays<00:01:10.260> scales<00:01:10.590> are

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
older I can see that the Rays scales are

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:11.899 
older I can see that the Rays scales are
there<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:10.979> i<00:01:11.010> think<00:01:11.220> as<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.400> gets<00:01:11.549> older

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
there and i think as it gets older

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.520 
there and i think as it gets older
they'll<00:01:12.330> raise<00:01:12.720> up<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:13.049> little<00:01:13.260> bit<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.470> you

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
they'll raise up a little bit and you

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.600 
they'll raise up a little bit and you
can<00:01:13.560> actually<00:01:13.740> see<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.070> pinstripe<00:01:14.430> better

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
can actually see the pinstripe better

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.670 
can actually see the pinstripe better
but<00:01:15.420> it's<00:01:15.540> partial<00:01:15.960> though<00:01:16.049> it's<00:01:16.200> not<00:01:16.350> full

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
but it's partial though it's not full

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.620 
but it's partial though it's not full
the<00:01:16.920> father<00:01:17.250> is<00:01:17.580> has<00:01:17.880> a<00:01:17.909> full<00:01:18.150> pinch<00:01:18.330> drag<00:01:18.540> this

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
the father is has a full pinch drag this

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.149 
the father is has a full pinch drag this
one<00:01:18.810> I<00:01:18.840> think<00:01:18.900> just<00:01:19.200> has<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.320> partial<00:01:19.799> if<00:01:20.070> I'm

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
one I think just has a partial if I'm

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.800 
one I think just has a partial if I'm
not<00:01:20.280> mistaken<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:21.330> sides<00:01:21.689> are<00:01:23.810> extreme

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
not mistaken the sides are extreme

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.740 
not mistaken the sides are extreme
hardly<00:01:25.200> sides<00:01:25.470> that<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.770> mother<00:01:26.009> has<00:01:26.100> and

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
hardly sides that the mother has and

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.480 
hardly sides that the mother has and
those<00:01:27.750> sides<00:01:28.110> fire<00:01:28.439> up<00:01:28.590> really<00:01:29.009> really<00:01:29.220> dark

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
those sides fire up really really dark

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.030 
those sides fire up really really dark
he's<00:01:29.729> just<00:01:29.880> not<00:01:30.000> fired<00:01:30.270> up<00:01:30.420> right<00:01:30.630> now<00:01:30.750> so<00:01:31.619> that
