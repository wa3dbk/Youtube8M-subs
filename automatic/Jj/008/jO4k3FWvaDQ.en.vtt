forward quite a bit as you can see we
have<00:00:15.160> two<00:00:15.549> communities<00:00:16.420> built<00:00:16.690> and<00:00:16.900> we're

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:17.590 
have two communities built and we're

have two communities built and we're
going<00:00:17.740> to<00:00:17.890> talk<00:00:18.610> about<00:00:18.790> now<00:00:19.060> building<00:00:19.540> a

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:19.660 
going to talk about now building a

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.840 
going to talk about now building a
Coliseum<00:00:20.080> as<00:00:20.530> a<00:00:20.560> central<00:00:21.010> point<00:00:21.310> for<00:00:21.640> years

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:21.850 
Coliseum as a central point for years

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:24.840 
Coliseum as a central point for years
for<00:00:22.270> a<00:00:22.300> large<00:00:22.600> city<00:00:22.960> there's<00:00:23.710> a<00:00:23.800> good<00:00:24.310> spot<00:00:24.670> of

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:24.850 
for a large city there's a good spot of

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.360 
for a large city there's a good spot of
flat<00:00:25.120> land<00:00:25.150> up<00:00:25.720> here<00:00:25.750> above<00:00:26.200> this<00:00:26.380> river<00:00:26.680> we've

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:27.370 
flat land up here above this river we've

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:29.640 
flat land up here above this river we've
built<00:00:27.640> one<00:00:27.880> good<00:00:28.600> solid<00:00:29.020> community<00:00:29.470> out<00:00:29.620> here

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:29.650 
built one good solid community out here

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.290 
built one good solid community out here
to<00:00:29.980> the<00:00:30.100> right<00:00:30.340> of<00:00:30.550> where<00:00:30.700> we<00:00:30.850> place<00:00:31.060> that

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.300 
to the right of where we place that

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.470 
to the right of where we place that
Coliseum<00:00:31.900> but<00:00:32.469> by<00:00:33.339> putting<00:00:33.550> of<00:00:33.850> calcium<00:00:34.329> there

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480 
Coliseum but by putting of calcium there

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.689 
Coliseum but by putting of calcium there
we<00:00:34.629> can<00:00:34.780> now<00:00:34.870> build<00:00:35.079> under<00:00:35.469> it<00:00:35.589> two<00:00:36.039> to<00:00:36.670> the

00:00:36.689 --> 00:00:36.699 
we can now build under it two to the

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:39.149 
we can now build under it two to the
left<00:00:37.179> of<00:00:37.600> it<00:00:37.690> as<00:00:37.839> we<00:00:37.960> look<00:00:38.140> at<00:00:38.320> it<00:00:38.469> and<00:00:38.559> above<00:00:39.010> it

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:39.159 
left of it as we look at it and above it

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:40.889 
left of it as we look at it and above it
because<00:00:39.640> there's<00:00:39.820> more<00:00:39.999> water<00:00:40.179> up<00:00:40.420> there<00:00:40.659> and

00:00:40.889 --> 00:00:40.899 
because there's more water up there and

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:42.540 
because there's more water up there and
of<00:00:41.289> course<00:00:41.320> we<00:00:41.620> have<00:00:41.710> water<00:00:41.920> all<00:00:42.159> along<00:00:42.370> the

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
of course we have water all along the

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.180 
of course we have water all along the
shoreline<00:00:43.059> to<00:00:43.359> draw<00:00:44.170> from<00:00:44.409> to<00:00:44.469> create

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
shoreline to draw from to create

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.009 
shoreline to draw from to create
fountains<00:00:45.760> so<00:00:46.329> we'll<00:00:46.510> create<00:00:46.690> a<00:00:46.809> community

00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:47.019 
fountains so we'll create a community

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:49.500 
fountains so we'll create a community
here<00:00:47.589> and<00:00:47.739> as<00:00:48.550> you<00:00:48.670> can<00:00:48.819> see<00:00:48.850> now<00:00:49.269> that<00:00:49.300> we<00:00:49.480> have

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
here and as you can see now that we have

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.069 
here and as you can see now that we have
resource<00:00:50.579> gathering<00:00:51.749> trumped<00:00:52.749> up<00:00:52.839> better

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 
resource gathering trumped up better

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:54.660 
resource gathering trumped up better
than<00:00:53.170> it<00:00:53.409> was<00:00:53.440> when<00:00:53.769> we<00:00:53.920> started<00:00:53.949> that<00:00:54.489> can

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
than it was when we started that can

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.309 
than it was when we started that can
kind<00:00:54.789> of<00:00:54.879> do<00:00:54.969> that<00:00:55.149> zap<00:00:55.390> zap<00:00:55.600> zap<00:00:55.629> building

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:56.319 
kind of do that zap zap zap building

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:57.809 
kind of do that zap zap zap building
where<00:00:56.469> I<00:00:56.499> just<00:00:56.800> kind<00:00:57.010> of<00:00:57.069> lay<00:00:57.370> things<00:00:57.640> out

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:57.819 
where I just kind of lay things out

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:59.700 
where I just kind of lay things out
quickly<00:00:58.120> and<00:00:58.449> build<00:00:58.989> that<00:00:59.050> quite<00:00:59.379> as<00:00:59.499> quickly

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
quickly and build that quite as quickly

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.700 
quickly and build that quite as quickly
and<00:00:59.979> staff<00:01:00.219> them<00:01:00.429> and<00:01:00.579> what<00:01:00.729> have<00:01:00.909> you<00:01:00.940> I<00:01:01.839> won't

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
and staff them and what have you I won't

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.940 
and staff them and what have you I won't
build<00:01:02.949> an<00:01:03.129> odium<00:01:03.579> down<00:01:03.760> here<00:01:03.999> because<00:01:04.950> we

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
build an odium down here because we

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.670 
build an odium down here because we
already<00:01:06.130> had<00:01:06.369> 100<00:01:07.649> entertainment<00:01:08.649> for

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
already had 100 entertainment for

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.830 
already had 100 entertainment for
anything<00:01:08.979> inside<00:01:09.430> that<00:01:09.939> calcium<00:01:10.240> so<00:01:10.780> the

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
anything inside that calcium so the

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.300 
anything inside that calcium so the
calcium<00:01:11.259> is<00:01:11.350> a<00:01:11.380> very<00:01:11.560> powerful<00:01:11.770> thing<00:01:12.189> to

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
calcium is a very powerful thing to

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.370 
calcium is a very powerful thing to
centralize<00:01:12.820> uses<00:01:13.210> a<00:01:13.240> central<00:01:13.719> part<00:01:13.899> of<00:01:14.079> your<00:01:14.229> a

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
centralize uses a central part of your a

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.240 
centralize uses a central part of your a
large<00:01:14.729> city<00:01:15.729> and<00:01:15.969> now<00:01:16.840> we're<00:01:17.049> getting<00:01:17.259> fast

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
large city and now we're getting fast

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.560 
large city and now we're getting fast
forward<00:01:18.640> more<00:01:18.850> we're<00:01:19.030> getting<00:01:19.270> right<00:01:19.390> to<00:01:19.450> the

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
forward more we're getting right to the

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.149 
forward more we're getting right to the
end<00:01:19.780> here<00:01:19.930> we're<00:01:20.259> going<00:01:20.469> to<00:01:20.560> build<00:01:20.680> our<00:01:20.829> Senate

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:24.009 
to finish off the mission and at this

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:25.859 
to finish off the mission and at this
point<00:01:24.219> we've<00:01:24.460> completed<00:01:24.909> our<00:01:25.060> research<00:01:25.570> are

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
point we've completed our research are

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:27.810 
point we've completed our research are

all of our ratings are over ninety
percent<00:01:28.000> right<00:01:28.840> now<00:01:29.020> and<00:01:29.229> one<00:01:29.770> big<00:01:30.159> reason<00:01:30.369> is

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:30.579 
percent right now and one big reason is

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:32.539 
percent right now and one big reason is
because<00:01:30.759> we<00:01:31.090> we<00:01:31.479> built<00:01:31.750> the<00:01:31.899> Circus<00:01:32.229> Maximus

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549

entertainment and we've built the

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.590 
entertainment and we've built the
Pantheon<00:01:38.380> for<00:01:38.710> a<00:01:38.740> global<00:01:39.039> boost<00:01:39.609> for<00:01:39.939> religion

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
Pantheon for a global boost for religion

research in the time allotted and I

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:08.120 
research in the time allotted and I
would<00:02:06.609> not<00:02:06.759> have<00:02:06.820> built<00:02:07.179> the<00:02:07.299> Senate<00:02:07.689> had

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
would not have built the Senate had

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.470 
would not have built the Senate had
I've<00:02:08.190> been<00:02:08.400> complete<00:02:08.820> with<00:02:08.970> my<00:02:09.150> research

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:09.480 
I've been complete with my research

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:12.620 
I've been complete with my research
because<00:02:10.760> you<00:02:11.760> know<00:02:11.880> that's<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.180> secondary

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
because you know that's the secondary

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.240 
because you know that's the secondary
objective<00:02:13.080> and<00:02:13.260> if<00:02:13.470> you<00:02:13.590> build<00:02:13.800> the<00:02:13.950> Senate

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
objective and if you build the Senate

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.890 
objective and if you build the Senate
you<00:02:14.430> would<00:02:14.580> deck<00:02:14.790> and<00:02:15.120> before<00:02:15.480> you<00:02:15.600> finished

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
you would deck and before you finished

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.000 
you would deck and before you finished
all<00:02:16.050> your<00:02:16.080> research<00:02:16.500> and<00:02:16.740> here<00:02:16.920> I'm

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
all your research and here I'm

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.850 
all your research and here I'm
double-checking<00:02:17.340> to<00:02:17.910> make<00:02:18.300> sure<00:02:18.660> that<00:02:19.650> if<00:02:19.770> you

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
double-checking to make sure that if you

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.380 
double-checking to make sure that if you
built<00:02:20.070> this<00:02:20.160> init<00:02:20.460> too<00:02:20.580> fast<00:02:20.880> you<00:02:21.210> could

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
built this init too fast you could

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.360 
built this init too fast you could
finish<00:02:21.840> off<00:02:22.110> the<00:02:22.320> mission<00:02:22.680> and<00:02:22.830> not<00:02:22.980> get<00:02:23.220> your

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
finish off the mission and not get your

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.070 
finish off the mission and not get your
secondary<00:02:23.760> objectives<00:02:24.390> so<00:02:24.540> always<00:02:24.840> kind<00:02:25.050> of

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
secondary objectives so always kind of

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.170 
secondary objectives so always kind of
here<00:02:25.560> on<00:02:25.650> double<00:02:26.010> checking<00:02:26.430> or<00:02:26.580> triple<00:02:26.970> check

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
here on double checking or triple check

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.040 
here on double checking or triple check
in<00:02:27.330> and<00:02:27.480> make<00:02:27.510> sure<00:02:27.630> I've<00:02:27.870> got<00:02:27.900> everything

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
in and make sure I've got everything

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.230 
in and make sure I've got everything
under<00:02:28.470> control<00:02:28.560> and<00:02:29.160> basically<00:02:29.790> we're<00:02:30.060> just

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
under control and basically we're just

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.660 
under control and basically we're just
riding<00:02:30.480> it<00:02:30.750> out<00:02:30.840> down<00:02:31.140> to<00:02:31.470> to<00:02:32.070> the<00:02:32.160> finish<00:02:32.490> but

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
riding it out down to to the finish but

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.280 
riding it out down to to the finish but
you<00:02:32.760> can<00:02:32.910> see<00:02:33.120> we're<00:02:33.300> over<00:02:33.480> ninety<00:02:33.780> percent<00:02:33.930> on

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
you can see we're over ninety percent on

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.010 
you can see we're over ninety percent on
all<00:02:34.410> of<00:02:34.560> our<00:02:34.680> ratings<00:02:35.130> and<00:02:35.520> we<00:02:36.240> have<00:02:36.360> 900

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
all of our ratings and we have 900

Lincoln's 975 research points that's
kind<00:02:39.900> of<00:02:39.990> maxing<00:02:40.770> out<00:02:40.920> so<00:02:41.550> when<00:02:41.730> we<00:02:41.850> were<00:02:41.970> doing

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
kind of maxing out so when we were doing

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.240 
kind of maxing out so when we were doing
that<00:02:42.300> the<00:02:42.660> last<00:02:42.930> research<00:02:43.530> is<00:02:43.740> going<00:02:44.130> very

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
that the last research is going very

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.610 
that the last research is going very
fast<00:02:44.520> also<00:02:45.270> used<00:02:45.450> Authority<00:02:45.990> a<00:02:46.020> lot<00:02:46.260> on<00:02:46.440> this

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
fast also used Authority a lot on this

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.890 
fast also used Authority a lot on this
one<00:02:46.830> bought<00:02:47.340> slaves<00:02:47.700> a<00:02:47.940> couple<00:02:48.240> times<00:02:48.480> to<00:02:48.750> do

some<00:02:49.140> marble<00:02:49.920> mines<00:02:50.130> also<00:02:50.640> imported<00:02:51.210> some

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
some marble mines also imported some

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.870 
some marble mines also imported some
marble<00:02:51.780> to<00:02:51.900> make<00:02:52.050> sure<00:02:52.230> I<00:02:52.260> had<00:02:52.500> plenty<00:02:52.800> to<00:02:53.100> so<00:02:53.850> I

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
marble to make sure I had plenty to so I

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.820 
marble to make sure I had plenty to so I
wouldn<00:02:54.150> f<00:02:54.210> slow<00:02:54.420> down<00:02:54.600> my<00:02:54.750> build<00:02:54.990> and<00:02:55.530> I<00:02:55.620> used

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
wouldn f slow down my build and I used

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.650 
wouldn f slow down my build and I used
authority<00:02:56.370> to<00:02:56.550> speed<00:02:56.970> up<00:02:57.150> a<00:02:57.270> couple<00:02:57.480> of
