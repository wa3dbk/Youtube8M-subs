 Hello and welcome to this one from Science Support 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:19.990
 today it is about speech recognition the indexed 7 Windows Vista or in 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:21.269
 Windows 7 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:24.599
 I would like to show today how this speech recognition 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:28.589
 Mr Markos own further define Mr 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:30.939
 and that was clearly a fact 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:33.939
 Work very or almost to play 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.440
 Season x does not even have speech recognition 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.440
 System control 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.610
 Having seen simple commands like the offense, that's trouble for him 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.800
 wonderful 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.740
 Of course there is still something missing for the right language code 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.300
 show me the latest technology - 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.020
 That's why there is here 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.080
 entered in the train field 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.080
 and that does not work really well 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.350
 not so far 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.260
 the steel me that 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.270
 Microsoft has one 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.050
 program 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:32.620
 which one issued 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.830
 Markus allows statesman 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.830
 Ruben the Speed ​​Sailing Record mix Marco Reus 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.790
 the States now and are ready to use 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.910
 and I can actually do many about them 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.910
 The couple will be used for a short time 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.940
 show me the latest technology - 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.290
 want presented 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.210
 that's extremely practical we just have it or something else 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.159
 other 

00:02:09.159 --> 00:02:12.159
 deep v 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:22.309
 It should be a little bit 

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:25.819
 TV Olpe instead of the Windows Media Center red numbers 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.149
 Calculator of the canton was exuberant 

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:32.149
 PC Games in the background include 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.099
 which is really cool 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:40.099
 so you can the calculator really good 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:43.969
 that makes everything possible 

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:46.319
 Microsoft Windows over 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.349
 Marko is for blind speech recognition 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:52.539
 and make Pang easy 

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:56.629
 in the system tray when I presented the program afterwards 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:59.319
 Minute to find her of course with her description 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:01.379
 clever because this link 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:03.370
 if it comes at least determined 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.309
 Marco Russ 

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:07.750
 I can now own my own under this link 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.099
 Create Markus or 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:16.000
 steep vegan lives Neutz ID Schmatko of course I can mean ECB Schmatko 

00:03:15.999 --> 00:03:18.489
 Edit or search command 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:22.519
 only about 30 million things but actually Niklas Pietsch Marko is for 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:24.179
 interesting to us 

00:03:24.179 --> 00:03:27.699
 in Vienna is Esther and in Windows 7 we have this field 

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:32.339
 and there we can answer what would like to imagine media for once 

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:34.389
 now stays in Schoenefeld 

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:38.019
 are priced in a box and I can just be a code command like this 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:39.349
 Example address 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:42.349
 with invested our address 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:45.409
 the most interesting for us is probably to require 

00:03:46.029 --> 00:03:49.129
 we can do that with programs 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:52.129
 So, for example, make cute animals 

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:55.499
 what a life I have the curiosity 

00:03:55.499 --> 00:03:57.329
 Firefox 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:59.570
 and over Braus can not tackle 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:03.279
 Hartmann's program also set decent for example here 

00:04:03.279 --> 00:04:04.479
 and the up 

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:06.289
 Vogt counter 

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:10.639
 and worn or Firefox and HP Firefox complex 

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:12.469
 that turns me off 

00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:15.469
 and if I click on next 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.120
 and then on Red 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.120
 with my Marc Ruef percent 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:28.389
 Let's move on and if I can do this Markus Rapp 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:31.389
 would work the speech recognition 

00:04:33.559 --> 00:04:36.559
 show me the latest technology - 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.199
 password manager Mader 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:42.199
 but I have not created much macho yet 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:46.860
 I can make it even cooler 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.999
 for people who know ITML 

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:51.719
 for all options are actually open 

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:56.199
 with the XML saver can not bring it control - talk to me 

00:04:56.199 --> 00:05:01.329
 can do - how much change with XML is everything possible but you have to 

00:05:01.329 --> 00:05:02.909
 know that Leon 

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:06.749
 with them I can even become class heads 

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:10.249
 or keystroke ceremonies 

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:12.219
 and 

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:13.770
 around 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.620
 other municipalities go out and big on the market 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.219
 on the rail 

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:21.519
 So for me this is one of the most important components with the 

00:05:21.519 --> 00:05:22.740
 voice recognition 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.699
 Because that has often targeted namely the own speech recognition own commands 

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:30.090
 and that makes the Gmünder speech recognition really productive 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:31.279
 use 

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:34.960
 who has done a lot of drinking and speech recognition also set 

00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:36.029
 Has 

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:37.349
 love this program 

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:40.289
 I think it's great and it's really there for everyone 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:44.379
 really grateful to use the track and the commands 

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:45.770
 give without it is called 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:48.309
 that is the problem that it did not understand 

00:05:48.309 --> 00:05:50.189
 what is he really like? 

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:53.680
 Masthead 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.420
 elaborate for fun and books will find chorus x and Windows 7 really good 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:02.460
 Background To learn the facts there are our videos but they are 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:06.749
 Of course not everything like the movie never brought that Windows 7 training 

00:06:06.749 --> 00:06:08.020
 for the versions 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:08.690
 bring to this
