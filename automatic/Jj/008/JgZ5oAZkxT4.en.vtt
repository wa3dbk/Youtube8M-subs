00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.549 
stick handling which as most of you guys
know<00:00:36.760> it<00:00:37.390> is<00:00:37.809> the<00:00:37.960> top<00:00:38.140> hand<00:00:38.409> that's

know it is the top hand that's

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:40.229 
know it is the top hand that's
responsible<00:00:39.069> for<00:00:39.370> the<00:00:39.460> control<00:00:39.819> of<00:00:39.850> the

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 
actual blade itself now one thing you

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.380 
actual blade itself now one thing you
see<00:00:42.309> with<00:00:42.489> guys<00:00:42.729> who<00:00:42.909> are<00:00:42.940> right<00:00:43.179> hand

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390 
see with guys who are right hand

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.809 
see with guys who are right hand
dominant<00:00:43.899> and<00:00:44.159> right-handed<00:00:45.159> shots<00:00:45.399> or<00:00:45.639> vice

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:45.819 
dominant and right-handed shots or vice

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:47.729 
dominant and right-handed shots or vice
versa<00:00:45.940> with<00:00:46.839> the<00:00:46.929> dominant<00:00:47.350> hand<00:00:47.499> on<00:00:47.649> the

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:47.739 
versa with the dominant hand on the

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:49.439 
versa with the dominant hand on the
bottom<00:00:48.129> one<00:00:48.429> of<00:00:48.550> the<00:00:48.609> biggest<00:00:48.909> mistakes<00:00:49.239> they

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:49.449 
bottom one of the biggest mistakes they

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:52.229 
bottom one of the biggest mistakes they
make<00:00:49.659> is<00:00:49.899> not<00:00:50.289> allowing<00:00:51.069> to<00:00:51.670> let<00:00:51.850> this<00:00:52.030> thick

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239 
make is not allowing to let this thick

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:54.689 
make is not allowing to let this thick
flow<00:00:52.629> freely<00:00:53.139> through<00:00:53.559> their<00:00:54.249> hand<00:00:54.460> meaning

00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:54.699 
flow freely through their hand meaning

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:57.270 
flow freely through their hand meaning
enough<00:00:55.269> movement<00:00:56.049> within<00:00:56.170> the<00:00:56.319> shaft<00:00:56.679> so

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
enough movement within the shaft so

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.189 
enough movement within the shaft so
you'll<00:00:57.459> see<00:00:57.609> them<00:00:57.760> squeezing<00:00:58.299> on<00:00:58.449> it<00:00:58.629> because

00:00:59.189 --> 00:00:59.199 
you'll see them squeezing on it because

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:00.989 
you'll see them squeezing on it because
it's<00:00:59.319> their<00:00:59.469> natural<00:00:59.649> strong<00:01:00.219> dominant<00:01:00.729> hand

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:00.999 
it's their natural strong dominant hand

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:02.759 
it's their natural strong dominant hand
so<00:01:01.149> they're<00:01:01.600> compensating<00:01:02.260> for<00:01:02.379> the<00:01:02.469> weaker

00:01:02.759 --> 00:01:02.769 
so they're compensating for the weaker

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:05.789 
so they're compensating for the weaker
top<00:01:02.979> hand<00:01:03.280> and<00:01:03.940> again<00:01:04.210> that's<00:01:04.390> a<00:01:04.510> debate<00:01:04.799> that

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:05.799 
top hand and again that's a debate that

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:07.230 
top hand and again that's a debate that
a<00:01:05.830> lot<00:01:06.070> of<00:01:06.100> people<00:01:06.400> have<00:01:06.549> is<00:01:06.760> you<00:01:06.909> know<00:01:07.000> top

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
a lot of people have is you know top

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.910 
a lot of people have is you know top
hand<00:01:07.510> dominant<00:01:08.200> hand<00:01:08.229> on<00:01:08.440> the<00:01:08.530> top<00:01:08.710> or<00:01:08.890> the

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
hand dominant hand on the top or the

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.590 
hand dominant hand on the top or the
bottom<00:01:09.100> and<00:01:09.430> there's<00:01:09.820> advantages<00:01:10.120> to<00:01:10.480> both

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
bottom and there's advantages to both

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.840 
bottom and there's advantages to both
ways<00:01:10.900> but<00:01:11.230> with<00:01:11.710> the<00:01:11.800> dominant<00:01:12.190> hand<00:01:12.310> bottom

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
ways but with the dominant hand bottom

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.570 
ways but with the dominant hand bottom
you<00:01:13.150> do<00:01:13.330> see<00:01:13.540> a<00:01:13.570> lot<00:01:13.780> of<00:01:13.810> over<00:01:14.170> squeezing<00:01:14.680> so

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
you do see a lot of over squeezing so

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.490 
you do see a lot of over squeezing so
this<00:01:15.790> is<00:01:15.910> a<00:01:15.940> great<00:01:16.690> little<00:01:16.840> training<00:01:17.230> aid

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
this is a great little training aid

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.290 
this is a great little training aid
that's<00:01:17.980> again<00:01:18.310> it's<00:01:18.460> very<00:01:18.490> simple<00:01:19.150> it's<00:01:19.270> very

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:19.300 
that's again it's very simple it's very

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.090 
that's again it's very simple it's very
simple<00:01:19.750> use<00:01:19.900> takes<00:01:20.140> about<00:01:20.260> two<00:01:20.590> seconds<00:01:20.980> to

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
simple use takes about two seconds to

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.950 
simple use takes about two seconds to
attach<00:01:21.370> it's<00:01:21.580> one<00:01:21.760> velcro<00:01:22.150> strap<00:01:22.480> that<00:01:22.900> goes

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
attach it's one velcro strap that goes

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.510 
attach it's one velcro strap that goes
around<00:01:23.230> your<00:01:23.500> normal<00:01:23.830> hockey<00:01:24.040> glove<00:01:24.370> so

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
around your normal hockey glove so

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
like a PVC pipe that this has is it's

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.370 
like a PVC pipe that this has is it's
got<00:01:33.280> the<00:01:33.700> opening<00:01:34.210> here<00:01:34.660> so<00:01:34.840> it's<00:01:35.200> not<00:01:35.320> a

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
got the opening here so it's not a

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.590 
got the opening here so it's not a
complete<00:01:35.890> circle<00:01:36.340> meaning<00:01:36.970> I<00:01:37.120> can<00:01:37.180> come<00:01:37.480> in

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
complete circle meaning I can come in

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.280 
complete circle meaning I can come in
and<00:01:37.750> out<00:01:37.810> of<00:01:37.930> it

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 
and out of it

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.740 
and out of it
I<00:01:38.320> can<00:01:38.740> go<00:01:39.520> into<00:01:39.670> a<00:01:39.790> one<00:01:40.030> from<00:01:40.270> a<00:01:40.360> one<00:01:40.510> hand

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
I can go into a one from a one hand

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.590 
I can go into a one from a one hand
carry<00:01:41.050> for<00:01:41.260> example<00:01:41.790> into<00:01:42.790> a<00:01:42.820> two<00:01:43.030> hand<00:01:43.270> carry

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
carry for example into a two hand carry

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.730 
carry for example into a two hand carry
and<00:01:43.900> not<00:01:44.010> have<00:01:45.010> any<00:01:45.250> sort<00:01:45.610> of<00:01:45.790> delay<00:01:46.360> in<00:01:46.740> trying

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
and not have any sort of delay in trying

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.980 
and not have any sort of delay in trying
to<00:01:47.830> reset<00:01:48.250> and<00:01:48.490> grab<00:01:48.700> the<00:01:48.880> PVC<00:01:49.390> pipe<00:01:49.630> from<00:01:49.900> the

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
to reset and grab the PVC pipe from the

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.690 
to reset and grab the PVC pipe from the
bottom<00:01:50.320> of<00:01:50.409> the<00:01:50.500> stick<00:01:50.710> again<00:01:51.010> or<00:01:51.460> anything

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
bottom of the stick again or anything

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:52.980 
bottom of the stick again or anything
like<00:01:51.880> that<00:01:51.940> the<00:01:52.240> other<00:01:52.390> thing<00:01:52.570> too<00:01:52.750> is<00:01:52.780> with<00:01:52.930> a

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
like that the other thing too is with a

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.690 
like that the other thing too is with a
PVC<00:01:53.170> pipe<00:01:53.440> a<00:01:53.710> lot<00:01:53.830> of<00:01:53.920> times<00:01:54.100> it's<00:01:54.280> it's<00:01:54.490> bigger

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
PVC pipe a lot of times it's it's bigger

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.280 
PVC pipe a lot of times it's it's bigger
it's<00:01:55.030> got<00:01:55.180> to<00:01:55.240> be<00:01:55.300> bigger<00:01:55.480> than<00:01:55.630> the<00:01:55.750> shaft<00:01:56.020> and

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
it's got to be bigger than the shaft and

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.110 
it's got to be bigger than the shaft and
it's<00:01:56.740> too<00:01:56.860> big<00:01:57.010> for<00:01:57.070> the<00:01:57.250> athletes<00:01:57.640> hands<00:01:57.880> so

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.120 
it's too big for the athletes hands so

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.910 
it's too big for the athletes hands so
their<00:01:58.659> hand<00:01:58.840> ends<00:01:59.080> up<00:01:59.200> open<00:01:59.560> in<00:01:59.680> a<00:01:59.740> very

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
their hand ends up open in a very

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.440 
their hand ends up open in a very
unnatural<00:02:00.100> position<00:02:00.880> they<00:02:00.970> actually<00:02:01.240> end<00:02:01.420> up

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
unnatural position they actually end up

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.600 
unnatural position they actually end up
squeezing<00:02:01.840> it<00:02:02.050> a<00:02:02.140> little<00:02:02.320> bit<00:02:02.440> more<00:02:02.650> which<00:02:03.580> is

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
squeezing it a little bit more which is

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:04.950 
squeezing it a little bit more which is
the<00:02:04.090> opposite<00:02:04.390> of<00:02:04.479> what<00:02:04.600> we're<00:02:04.720> trying<00:02:04.870> to

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
the opposite of what we're trying to

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.260 
the opposite of what we're trying to
train<00:02:05.200> for<00:02:05.380> with<00:02:05.560> this<00:02:05.740> you<00:02:06.100> can<00:02:06.250> see<00:02:06.460> my<00:02:07.030> hand

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
train for with this you can see my hand

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.869 
train for with this you can see my hand
fits<00:02:07.540> nice<00:02:08.319> and<00:02:08.349> nice<00:02:08.979> and<00:02:09.159> snug<00:02:09.369> around<00:02:09.519> it

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:09.879 
fits nice and nice and snug around it

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:12.149 
fits nice and nice and snug around it
there's<00:02:10.060> no<00:02:10.209> extra<00:02:10.720> squeezing<00:02:11.650> required<00:02:11.980> on

00:02:12.149 --> 00:02:12.159 
there's no extra squeezing required on

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:14.879 
there's no extra squeezing required on
my<00:02:12.310> part<00:02:12.580> in<00:02:13.150> order<00:02:13.420> to<00:02:13.629> make<00:02:14.109> this<00:02:14.290> work<00:02:14.349> so

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:14.889 
my part in order to make this work so

00:02:14.889 --> 00:02:18.149 
my part in order to make this work so
again<00:02:15.730> now<00:02:15.909> I<00:02:15.939> can<00:02:16.209> go<00:02:16.329> from<00:02:16.510> here<00:02:16.870> I<00:02:17.079> can<00:02:18.069> go

00:02:18.149 --> 00:02:18.159 
again now I can go from here I can go

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:19.230 
again now I can go from here I can go
into<00:02:18.340> a<00:02:18.430> one<00:02:18.639> hand<00:02:18.879> care

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
into a one hand care

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.720 
into a one hand care
and<00:02:19.510> then<00:02:20.050> again<00:02:20.290> right<00:02:20.560> back<00:02:20.740> into<00:02:21.190> training

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
and then again right back into training

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:22.410 
and then again right back into training
with<00:02:22.060> it

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
with it

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.540 
with it
without<00:02:23.140> having<00:02:23.380> to<00:02:23.560> worry<00:02:23.620> about<00:02:23.830> any<00:02:24.160> extra

without having to worry about any extra

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.880 
without having to worry about any extra
pieces<00:02:24.700> floating<00:02:25.240> around<00:02:25.360> so<00:02:25.960> again<00:02:26.740> the

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
pieces floating around so again the
