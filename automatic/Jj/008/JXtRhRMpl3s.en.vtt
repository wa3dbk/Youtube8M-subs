called<00:01:53.460> venom<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.180> my<00:01:54.479> hope<00:01:54.780> is<00:01:55.140> that<00:01:55.170> Nolan

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
called venom and my hope is that Nolan

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:56.810 
called venom and my hope is that Nolan
will<00:01:55.860> create<00:01:56.130> something<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.579> little<00:01:56.700> more

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
will create something a little more

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.539 
will create something a little more
realistic<00:01:57.390> that<00:01:57.810> will<00:01:57.960> cause<00:01:58.110> Bane<00:01:58.439> to<00:01:58.770> become

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
realistic that will cause Bane to become

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.209 
realistic that will cause Bane to become
bein<00:01:59.939> more<00:02:00.420> realistic<00:02:00.930> is<00:02:01.320> good<00:02:01.649> it's<00:02:01.950> good

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
bein more realistic is good it's good

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.859 
bein more realistic is good it's good
what<00:02:02.610> I'm<00:02:02.700> hoping<00:02:02.820> for<00:02:03.030> is<00:02:03.149> that<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.450> Bane<00:02:03.630> and

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
what I'm hoping for is that the Bane and

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.749 
what I'm hoping for is that the Bane and
Catwoman<00:02:04.350> stories<00:02:04.680> won't<00:02:04.979> completely<00:02:05.430> weave

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
Catwoman stories won't completely weave

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.670 
Catwoman stories won't completely weave
together<00:02:06.030> because<00:02:06.719> if<00:02:06.899> Batman<00:02:07.229> finds<00:02:07.500> one

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
together because if Batman finds one

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.199 
together because if Batman finds one
baddie<00:02:07.890> he'll<00:02:08.160> find<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.489> other<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:08.910> it's

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
baddie he'll find the other and it's

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.880 
baddie he'll find the other and it's
just<00:02:09.479> going<00:02:09.569> to<00:02:09.629> be<00:02:09.720> a<00:02:09.780> piece<00:02:09.959> of<00:02:09.989> cake<00:02:10.080> but<00:02:10.739> if

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
just going to be a piece of cake but if

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.170 
just going to be a piece of cake but if
they're<00:02:11.039> both<00:02:11.190> wreaking<00:02:11.489> havoc<00:02:11.760> separately

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
they're both wreaking havoc separately

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.170 
they're both wreaking havoc separately

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
that moves the theme to

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.789 
that moves the theme to
that<00:02:13.329> of<00:02:13.540> the<00:02:13.629> struggles<00:02:14.049> of<00:02:14.200> an<00:02:14.349> overwhelmed

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:14.799 
that of the struggles of an overwhelmed

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:16.319 
that of the struggles of an overwhelmed
hero<00:02:15.040> I'm<00:02:15.459> thinking<00:02:15.790> that<00:02:15.879> this<00:02:16.000> movie<00:02:16.299> is

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:16.329 
hero I'm thinking that this movie is

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:17.880 
hero I'm thinking that this movie is
going<00:02:16.540> to<00:02:16.599> be<00:02:16.689> a<00:02:16.750> lot<00:02:16.900> more<00:02:16.930> physical<00:02:17.560> than<00:02:17.590> the

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
going to be a lot more physical than the

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.080 
going to be a lot more physical than the
first<00:02:18.099> two<00:02:18.280> because<00:02:18.549> the<00:02:18.640> first<00:02:18.819> one<00:02:18.909> was

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
first two because the first one was

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.429 
first two because the first one was
really<00:02:19.329> good<00:02:19.450> with<00:02:19.569> setting<00:02:19.840> the<00:02:19.930> story<00:02:20.170> arc

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:20.439 
really good with setting the story arc

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:23.429 
really good with setting the story arc
