how<00:01:16.179> our<00:01:16.959> whole<00:01:17.170> team<00:01:17.350> combines<00:01:17.709> together<00:01:17.890> so

00:01:18.809 --> 00:01:18.819 
how our whole team combines together so

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:20.730 
how our whole team combines together so
so<00:01:19.149> far<00:01:19.330> we've<00:01:19.539> finished<00:01:20.050> modeling<00:01:20.649> the

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
so far we've finished modeling the

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.529 
so far we've finished modeling the
characters<00:01:21.130> modeling<00:01:21.670> the<00:01:21.789> scenery<00:01:22.090> and

00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:22.539 
characters modeling the scenery and

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:23.790 
characters modeling the scenery and
right<00:01:22.750> now<00:01:22.869> we're<00:01:23.050> just<00:01:23.080> working<00:01:23.319> on<00:01:23.560> putting

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:23.800 
right now we're just working on putting

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.169 
right now we're just working on putting
them<00:01:24.009> all<00:01:24.099> together<00:01:24.220> and<00:01:24.640> making<00:01:24.849> it<00:01:25.060> all

00:01:25.169 --> 00:01:25.179 
them all together and making it all

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:26.940 
them all together and making it all
movie<00:01:25.420> and<00:01:25.630> having<00:01:25.929> to<00:01:26.080> be<00:01:26.229> beautiful

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950

movie and having to be beautiful
animation<00:01:27.729> that<00:01:27.910> we're<00:01:28.030> gonna<00:01:28.149> show<00:01:28.390> it<00:01:28.420> our

00:01:28.589 --> 00:01:28.599 
animation that we're gonna show it our

00:01:28.599 --> 00:01:34.470 
animation that we're gonna show it our
robot<00:01:28.869> roll<00:01:29.080> out

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:34.480 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.000 

over<00:01:35.480> the<00:01:35.570> past<00:01:35.780> two<00:01:35.960> weeks<00:01:35.990> we<00:01:36.440> continue

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.010 
over the past two weeks we continue

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:38.620 
over the past two weeks we continue
developing<00:01:37.430> on<00:01:37.550> our<00:01:37.670> prototypes<00:01:38.090> and<00:01:38.360> we<00:01:38.510> use

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
developing on our prototypes and we use

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.060 
developing on our prototypes and we use
the<00:01:38.690> performance<00:01:39.110> of<00:01:39.170> those<00:01:39.320> prototypes<00:01:39.530> to

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
the performance of those prototypes to

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.770 
the performance of those prototypes to
decide<00:01:40.340> what<00:01:40.670> magnet<00:01:40.970> we're<00:01:41.300> going<00:01:41.450> to<00:01:41.600> use

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
decide what magnet we're going to use

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.170 
decide what magnet we're going to use
for<00:01:42.080> our<00:01:42.200> final<00:01:42.380> robot<00:01:42.800> once<00:01:43.520> those<00:01:43.730> decisions

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
for our final robot once those decisions

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.880 
for our final robot once those decisions
were<00:01:44.300> made<00:01:44.480> if<00:01:44.690> you<00:01:44.780> started<00:01:45.080> working<00:01:45.560> towards

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
were made if you started working towards

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.800 
were made if you started working towards
the<00:01:46.010> final<00:01:46.340> designs<00:01:46.610> in<00:01:46.910> autodesk<00:01:47.690> inventor

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
the final designs in autodesk inventor

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.800 
the final designs in autodesk inventor
and<00:01:48.410> as<00:01:49.310> parts<00:01:49.760> started<00:01:50.090> to<00:01:50.180> get<00:01:50.300> designed<00:01:50.690> to

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
and as parts started to get designed to

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.150 
and as parts started to get designed to
finalize<00:01:51.200> we<00:01:51.350> have<00:01:51.500> several<00:01:51.710> design<00:01:52.070> reviews

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.160 
finalize we have several design reviews

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.890 
finalize we have several design reviews
we<00:01:55.160> looked<00:01:55.820> at<00:01:55.940> the<00:01:56.030> complexity<00:01:56.420> of<00:01:56.540> the<00:01:56.660> part

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:56.900 
we looked at the complexity of the part

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.540 
we looked at the complexity of the part
and<00:01:57.050> how<00:01:57.170> hard<00:01:57.410> it<00:01:57.560> would<00:01:57.650> be<00:01:57.710> to<00:01:57.830> manufacture

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
and how hard it would be to manufacture

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.520 
and how hard it would be to manufacture
we<00:01:59.300> then<00:01:59.450> made<00:01:59.630> the<00:01:59.750> decision<00:02:00.110> whether<00:02:00.230> or<00:02:00.440> not

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
we then made the decision whether or not

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:01.900 
we then made the decision whether or not
we<00:02:00.680> were<00:02:00.740> going<00:02:00.950> to<00:02:01.040> make<00:02:01.160> the<00:02:01.280> part<00:02:01.520> in<00:02:01.670> house

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:01.910 
we were going to make the part in house

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.330 
we were going to make the part in house
on<00:02:02.150> our<00:02:02.210> 5<00:02:02.420> x's<00:02:02.780> smell<00:02:03.050> or<00:02:03.440> send<00:02:03.830> it<00:02:03.920> out<00:02:04.040> to<00:02:04.220> one

of<00:02:12.050> the<00:02:12.140> prototyping<00:02:12.770> phase<00:02:12.830> our<00:02:13.370> software

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
of the prototyping phase our software

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:14.890 
of the prototyping phase our software
and<00:02:14.000> electrical<00:02:14.390> team<00:02:14.540> started

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
and electrical team started

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.360 
and electrical team started
experimenting<00:02:15.170> with<00:02:15.470> different<00:02:15.650> sensors<00:02:16.190> to

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
experimenting with different sensors to

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:17.770 
experimenting with different sensors to
see<00:02:16.520> what<00:02:16.640> type<00:02:16.790> of<00:02:16.820> control<00:02:17.270> systems<00:02:17.660> would

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
see what type of control systems would

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.960 
see what type of control systems would
be<00:02:17.900> best<00:02:18.110> for<00:02:19.040> these<00:02:19.190> different<00:02:19.520> mechanisms

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
be best for these different mechanisms

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.360 
be best for these different mechanisms
at<00:02:20.270> this<00:02:21.140> point<00:02:21.350> in<00:02:21.410> the<00:02:21.500> build<00:02:21.620> season<00:02:21.890> we

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
at this point in the build season we

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.770 
at this point in the build season we
have<00:02:22.459> both<00:02:22.640> diagrams<00:02:23.090> completely<00:02:23.540> assembled

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
have both diagrams completely assembled

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.630 
have both diagrams completely assembled
and<00:02:24.140> our<00:02:24.470> electrical<00:02:24.590> software<00:02:25.340> team<00:02:25.490> they

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
and our electrical software team they

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.030 
and our electrical software team they
are<00:02:25.700> working<00:02:25.970> to<00:02:26.180> get<00:02:26.300> e<00:02:26.480> practice<00:02:27.350> wat<00:02:27.530> wired

up<00:02:28.220> with<00:02:29.000> a<00:02:29.030> large<00:02:29.300> set<00:02:29.510> of<00:02:29.540> rookies<00:02:29.870> this<00:02:30.020> year

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
up with a large set of rookies this year

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.900 
up with a large set of rookies this year
we've<00:02:30.470> been<00:02:30.590> able<00:02:30.740> to<00:02:30.980> effectively<00:02:31.340> split<00:02:31.760> off

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
we've been able to effectively split off

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.640 
we've been able to effectively split off
the<00:02:32.390> rookies<00:02:32.720> into<00:02:32.959> different<00:02:33.320> subsystems

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
the rookies into different subsystems

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.010 
the rookies into different subsystems
toward<00:02:34.430> with<00:02:34.670> more<00:02:35.150> experienced<00:02:35.660> veterans

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
toward with more experienced veterans

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.440
