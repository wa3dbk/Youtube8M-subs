00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:30.490 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:35.730 

without<00:03:31.180> music<00:03:31.270> and<00:03:32.700> so<00:03:34.140> Adam<00:03:35.140> Pina<00:03:35.440> went<00:03:35.650> out

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:35.740

on our treasure hunt in the Galapagos

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.300 
on our treasure hunt in the Galapagos
but<00:03:38.050> perhaps<00:03:38.470> they<00:03:38.680> didn't<00:03:38.830> have<00:03:38.920> enough<00:03:39.070> look

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
but perhaps they didn't have enough look

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.950 
but perhaps they didn't have enough look
for<00:03:39.700> although<00:03:39.820> there<00:03:40.120> was<00:03:40.240> no<00:03:40.390> real<00:03:40.570> trouble

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:40.960 
for although there was no real trouble

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.150 
for although there was no real trouble
they<00:03:41.110> weren't<00:03:41.380> able<00:03:41.470> to<00:03:41.650> find<00:03:41.860> the<00:03:42.010> island

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
they weren't able to find the island

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.940 
they weren't able to find the island
that<00:03:42.520> they<00:03:42.640> were<00:03:42.700> searching<00:03:43.030> for<00:03:43.770> ten<00:03:44.770> days

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
that they were searching for ten days

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.470 
that they were searching for ten days
later<00:03:45.190> they<00:03:45.460> returned<00:03:45.790> with<00:03:45.970> a<00:03:46.000> treasure<00:03:46.270> box

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
later they returned with a treasure box

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.970 
later they returned with a treasure box
they<00:03:46.780> happen<00:03:47.080> to<00:03:47.110> find<00:03:47.200> on<00:03:47.590> the<00:03:47.680> southern

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
they happen to find on the southern

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.540 
they happen to find on the southern
island<00:03:49.710> that's<00:03:50.710> exact<00:03:50.950> what<00:03:51.100> I'm<00:03:51.190> talking

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:51.550 
island that's exact what I'm talking

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:58.760 
island that's exact what I'm talking
about<00:03:54.090> this<00:03:55.090> is<00:03:55.240> not<00:03:55.390> the<00:03:55.540> treasure<00:03:55.750> of<00:03:56.050> Tonga

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:58.770 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:07.100 

because<00:04:03.540> there's<00:04:04.540> a<00:04:04.600> maze<00:04:04.840> when<00:04:05.200> you<00:04:05.260> go<00:04:05.410> there

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
because there's a maze when you go there

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:22.970 
because there's a maze when you go there
instead<00:04:08.110> we<00:04:08.380> found<00:04:08.620> a<00:04:09.060> skull<00:04:14.310> yeah<00:04:18.150> anyways

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:22.980 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.130 

that's<00:04:23.820> one<00:04:24.000> of<00:04:24.030> the<00:04:24.150> game's<00:04:24.330> best

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
that's one of the game's best

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.450 
that's one of the game's best
moments<00:04:25.560> there's<00:04:25.860> nothing<00:04:26.100> you<00:04:26.160> can<00:04:26.250> do<00:04:26.340> about

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
moments there's nothing you can do about

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.610 
moments there's nothing you can do about
that<00:04:26.610> now<00:04:27.000> as<00:04:27.750> I'll<00:04:28.110> come<00:04:28.350> back<00:04:30.320> I'm<00:04:31.320> gonna<00:04:31.470> end

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
that now as I'll come back I'm gonna end

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.110 
that now as I'll come back I'm gonna end
it<00:04:31.680> here<00:04:31.770> actually<00:04:32.160> and<00:04:32.460> I'll<00:04:32.610> start<00:04:32.850> the<00:04:33.000> next

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120
