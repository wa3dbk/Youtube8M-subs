you'll also find on the Primo it has a

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:08.980 
you'll also find on the Primo it has a
chi<00:02:06.529> mei<00:02:06.709> solenoid<00:02:07.390> which<00:02:08.390> is<00:02:08.509> a<00:02:08.539> nice<00:02:08.720> feature

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
chi mei solenoid which is a nice feature

on<00:02:09.679> an<00:02:09.950> entry<00:02:10.220> level<00:02:10.429> steamer<00:02:10.879> when<00:02:11.420> you<00:02:11.510> pull

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
on an entry level steamer when you pull

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.449 
on an entry level steamer when you pull
the<00:02:11.840> trigger<00:02:11.870> the<00:02:12.830> steam<00:02:13.069> would<00:02:13.250> come<00:02:13.430> out

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
the trigger the steam would come out

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.240 
the trigger the steam would come out
from<00:02:13.849> here<00:02:14.209> so<00:02:14.420> when<00:02:14.540> you<00:02:14.569> let<00:02:14.780> go

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
from here so when you let go

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.430 
from here so when you let go
figure<00:02:15.490> the<00:02:15.970> steam<00:02:16.240> turns<00:02:16.600> back<00:02:16.870> into<00:02:16.900> water

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
figure the steam turns back into water

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.900 
figure the steam turns back into water
and<00:02:17.680> the<00:02:17.800> line<00:02:17.980> so<00:02:18.340> every<00:02:18.520> time<00:02:18.610> you<00:02:18.730> pull<00:02:18.880> the

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
and the line so every time you pull the

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.580 
and the line so every time you pull the
trigger<00:02:18.970> again<00:02:19.540> you're<00:02:20.050> gonna<00:02:20.140> have<00:02:20.260> to<00:02:20.350> blow

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
trigger again you're gonna have to blow

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.760 
trigger again you're gonna have to blow
the<00:02:20.800> water<00:02:21.010> out<00:02:21.310> to<00:02:21.340> clear<00:02:21.760> purge<00:02:22.180> the<00:02:22.390> line

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
the water out to clear purge the line

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.010 
the water out to clear purge the line
when<00:02:23.770> you<00:02:23.800> have<00:02:24.100> a<00:02:24.150> solenoid<00:02:25.150> it<00:02:25.720> actually

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
when you have a solenoid it actually

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.410 
when you have a solenoid it actually
expels<00:02:26.500> the<00:02:27.010> steam<00:02:27.250> from<00:02:27.580> the<00:02:27.790> unit<00:02:28.180> so<00:02:28.390> you

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
expels the steam from the unit so you

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.990 
expels the steam from the unit so you
don't<00:02:28.660> have<00:02:28.900> to<00:02:29.080> purge<00:02:29.410> it<00:02:29.440> as<00:02:29.770> often<00:02:30.010> so<00:02:30.520> the

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
don't have to purge it as often so the

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.610 
don't have to purge it as often so the
steam<00:02:31.210> goes<00:02:31.390> all<00:02:31.570> the<00:02:31.600> way<00:02:31.780> through<00:02:32.410> as

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
steam goes all the way through as

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.560 
steam goes all the way through as
opposed<00:02:32.950> to<00:02:33.040> getting<00:02:33.280> stuck<00:02:33.730> between<00:02:34.120> the

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570 
opposed to getting stuck between the

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
trigger and the unit itself so you want
