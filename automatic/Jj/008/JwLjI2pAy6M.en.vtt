little light like right here will come

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.749 
little light like right here will come
on<00:01:58.140> let<00:01:58.380> you<00:01:58.469> know<00:01:58.590> if<00:01:58.649> it's<00:01:58.770> charging<00:01:59.070> now

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
on let you know if it's charging now

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.100 
on let you know if it's charging now
this<00:01:59.909> controller<00:02:00.240> is<00:02:00.299> fully<00:02:00.540> charged<00:02:00.960> because

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
this controller is fully charged because

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.510 
this controller is fully charged because
I<00:02:01.380> always<00:02:01.530> keep<00:02:01.649> it<00:02:02.009> plugged<00:02:02.159> in<00:02:02.280> while<00:02:02.460> I'm

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
I always keep it plugged in while I'm

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.090 
I always keep it plugged in while I'm
playing<00:02:02.729> destiny<00:02:03.110> because<00:02:04.110> it<00:02:04.649> kills<00:02:04.950> the

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
playing destiny because it kills the

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.969 
playing destiny because it kills the
battery<00:02:05.399> very<00:02:05.729> fast<00:02:06.119> as<00:02:07.020> you<00:02:07.320> tend<00:02:07.680> to<00:02:07.799> play

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
battery very fast as you tend to play

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.790 
battery very fast as you tend to play
for<00:02:08.220> a<00:02:08.250> long<00:02:08.429> time<00:02:08.759> and<00:02:09.390> with<00:02:10.289> this<00:02:10.440> controller

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
for a long time and with this controller

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.500 
for a long time and with this controller
we<00:02:10.920> can<00:02:10.950> plug<00:02:11.250> this<00:02:11.400> in<00:02:11.670> and<00:02:11.910> it<00:02:12.180> will<00:02:12.330> charge

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
we can plug this in and it will charge

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.530 
we can plug this in and it will charge
up<00:02:12.750> this<00:02:12.930> controller

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
up this controller

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.479 
up this controller
-<00:02:13.629> now<00:02:14.379> this<00:02:14.680> doesn't<00:02:14.860> have<00:02:15.010> like<00:02:15.189> a<00:02:15.220> little

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
- now this doesn't have like a little

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.850 
- now this doesn't have like a little
LED<00:02:15.849> on<00:02:16.060> the<00:02:16.239> thing<00:02:16.420> here<00:02:16.450> so<00:02:16.900> it<00:02:17.590> doesn't

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
LED on the thing here so it doesn't

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:18.780 
LED on the thing here so it doesn't
really<00:02:17.950> tell<00:02:18.159> you<00:02:18.250> the<00:02:18.370> controller's

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
really tell you the controller's

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.089 
really tell you the controller's
charging<00:02:19.209> but<00:02:19.329> it<00:02:19.450> is<00:02:19.629> and<00:02:20.379> we<00:02:20.560> can<00:02:20.590> take<00:02:20.920> like

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
charging but it is and we can take like

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:23.280 
charging but it is and we can take like
a<00:02:21.129> little<00:02:21.310> power<00:02:21.640> bank<00:02:21.939> here<00:02:22.269> and<00:02:22.840> we<00:02:22.959> can<00:02:23.140> make

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
a little power bank here and we can make

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.809 
a little power bank here and we can make
sure<00:02:23.319> that<00:02:23.739> it's<00:02:23.890> fully<00:02:24.069> charged<00:02:24.549> for

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
sure that it's fully charged for

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.750 
sure that it's fully charged for
whenever<00:02:24.970> we<00:02:25.239> leave<00:02:25.840> and<00:02:26.200> we<00:02:26.230> want<00:02:26.530> to<00:02:26.760> have

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
whenever we leave and we want to have

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.289 
whenever we leave and we want to have
some<00:02:28.030> power<00:02:28.209> where's<00:02:28.780> the<00:02:28.989> little<00:02:29.170> light

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:35.729 

there<00:02:34.299> we<00:02:34.420> go<00:02:34.540> I<00:02:34.569> didn't<00:02:34.840> have<00:02:34.959> the<00:02:35.079> box<00:02:35.290> on<00:02:35.500> and

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
there we go I didn't have the box on and

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.039 
there we go I didn't have the box on and
now<00:02:35.799> this<00:02:36.040> is<00:02:36.220> blinking<00:02:36.700> the<00:02:37.540> light<00:02:37.750> on<00:02:37.900> the

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049 
now this is blinking the light on the

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:40.949 
now this is blinking the light on the
controller<00:02:38.909> let's<00:02:39.909> see<00:02:40.209> if<00:02:40.420> we<00:02:40.540> can<00:02:40.690> get<00:02:40.840> that

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
controller let's see if we can get that

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.670 
controller let's see if we can get that
to<00:02:41.140> turn<00:02:41.319> on<00:02:42.060> yes<00:02:43.060> it<00:02:43.359> glows<00:02:43.840> like<00:02:44.049> an<00:02:44.260> orange

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
to turn on yes it glows like an orange

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.680 
to turn on yes it glows like an orange
and<00:02:45.069> then<00:02:45.700> it's<00:02:45.819> going<00:02:45.970> to<00:02:46.030> stop<00:02:46.180> glowing<00:02:46.420> cuz

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
and then it's going to stop glowing cuz

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.170 
and then it's going to stop glowing cuz
it's<00:02:46.870> full<00:02:47.079> and<00:02:47.379> then<00:02:48.370> this<00:02:48.549> isn't<00:02:48.760> gonna<00:02:48.970> do

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
it's full and then this isn't gonna do

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.210 
it's full and then this isn't gonna do
anything<00:02:49.359> like<00:02:50.290> I<00:02:50.379> said<00:02:50.590> it<00:02:50.799> doesn't<00:02:50.950> have<00:02:51.129> a

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
anything like I said it doesn't have a

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.280 
anything like I said it doesn't have a
little<00:02:51.519> way<00:02:52.209> to<00:02:52.269> know<00:02:52.599> it's<00:02:52.750> charging<00:02:53.049> less

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
little way to know it's charging less

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.869 
little way to know it's charging less
you<00:02:53.409> turn<00:02:53.590> it<00:02:53.709> on<00:02:53.799> and<00:02:53.859> you<00:02:54.129> hold<00:02:54.670> the<00:02:54.760> button

00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:54.879 
you turn it on and you hold the button

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:57.660 
you turn it on and you hold the button
down<00:02:55.090> and<00:02:55.120> view<00:02:55.510> the<00:02:55.659> Xbox<00:02:56.340> dashboard<00:02:57.340> and

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
then this right there is flashing and

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.379 
then this right there is flashing and
then<00:02:59.680> we<00:02:59.769> can<00:02:59.889> plug<00:03:00.069> in<00:03:00.099> our<00:03:00.340> next<00:03:00.609> two<00:03:00.670> six<00:03:00.970> in

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:01.389 
then we can plug in our next two six in

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:03.270 
then we can plug in our next two six in
charge<00:03:02.079> of<00:03:02.230> fourth<00:03:02.440> mobile<00:03:02.769> device<00:03:02.980> at<00:03:03.190> the
