00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.060 

this<00:00:22.910> is<00:00:23.090> a<00:00:23.119> one<00:00:23.840> circuit<00:00:24.320> for<00:00:24.559> a<00:00:24.590> drive<00:00:24.890> motor

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.070 
this is a one circuit for a drive motor

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.220 
this is a one circuit for a drive motor
and<00:00:25.399> this<00:00:26.029> is<00:00:26.149> another<00:00:26.300> circuit<00:00:26.779> for<00:00:27.050> another

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230 
and this is another circuit for another

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.159 
and this is another circuit for another
odor<00:00:27.680> possibly<00:00:28.369> the<00:00:28.430> steering<00:00:28.759> motor<00:00:28.910> and<00:00:29.239> we

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:30.169 
odor possibly the steering motor and we

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:32.019 
odor possibly the steering motor and we
have<00:00:30.320> two<00:00:30.500> relays<00:00:30.829> to<00:00:31.520> double<00:00:31.820> pole<00:00:32.000> double

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:32.029 
have two relays to double pole double

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.919 
have two relays to double pole double
throw<00:00:32.450> relays<00:00:33.250> I<00:00:34.250> for<00:00:35.120> the<00:00:35.210> first<00:00:35.239> one<00:00:35.660> here<00:00:35.899> I

00:00:35.919 --> 00:00:35.929 
throw relays I for the first one here I

00:00:35.929 --> 00:00:37.209 
throw relays I for the first one here I
could<00:00:36.140> have<00:00:36.260> gotten<00:00:36.410> away<00:00:36.559> with<00:00:36.800> a<00:00:36.829> single

00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:37.219 
could have gotten away with a single

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:40.299 
could have gotten away with a single
pulse<00:00:37.460> or<00:00:37.760> single<00:00:38.269> throw<00:00:38.510> relay<00:00:39.260> and<00:00:39.649> I<00:00:40.100> have<00:00:40.280> a

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:40.309 
pulse or single throw relay and I have a

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:41.799 
pulse or single throw relay and I have a
diode<00:00:40.699> so<00:00:40.850> there's<00:00:41.030> really<00:00:41.210> effectively

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
diode so there's really effectively

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:45.489 
diode so there's really effectively
three<00:00:42.620> components<00:00:43.429> that<00:00:44.440> supply<00:00:45.440> this

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:45.499 
three components that supply this

00:00:45.499 --> 00:00:47.950 
three components that supply this
switching<00:00:46.160> logic<00:00:46.609> and<00:00:46.850> then<00:00:47.539> here<00:00:47.780> I<00:00:47.809> have

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
switching logic and then here I have

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.009 
switching logic and then here I have
this<00:00:48.050> nice<00:00:48.289> connector<00:00:48.829> that<00:00:49.039> comes<00:00:49.460> in<00:00:50.019> with

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:51.019 
this nice connector that comes in with

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:53.709 
this nice connector that comes in with
signals<00:00:51.499> from<00:00:51.589> the<00:00:51.679> spot<00:00:52.100> and<00:00:52.600> power<00:00:53.600> and

00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:53.719 
signals from the spot and power and

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:56.439 
signals from the spot and power and
ground<00:00:54.129> here<00:00:55.129> and<00:00:55.309> then<00:00:55.850> on<00:00:55.969> the<00:00:56.059> other<00:00:56.089> side

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:56.449 
ground here and then on the other side

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:59.110 
ground here and then on the other side
of<00:00:56.480> this<00:00:56.690> I<00:00:56.870> have<00:00:56.989> these<00:00:57.109> nice<00:00:57.819> male<00:00:58.819> female

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
of this I have these nice male female

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.250 
of this I have these nice male female
connectors<00:00:59.899> that<00:01:01.300> allow<00:01:02.300> me<00:01:02.479> to<00:01:02.600> modularly

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
connectors that allow me to modularly

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.960 
connectors that allow me to modularly
connect<00:01:04.210> the<00:01:05.210> motor<00:01:05.780> to<00:01:06.110> our<00:01:07.100> circuitry<00:01:07.700> and

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
connect the motor to our circuitry and

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.840 
connect the motor to our circuitry and
then<00:01:08.780> if<00:01:08.900> you<00:01:08.960> look<00:01:09.110> at<00:01:09.230> the<00:01:09.290> bottom<00:01:09.670> half<00:01:10.670> of

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
then if you look at the bottom half of

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.930 
then if you look at the bottom half of
this<00:01:11.290> you'll<00:01:12.290> see<00:01:12.620> you<00:01:12.800> can<00:01:12.830> see<00:01:13.190> that<00:01:13.220> this<00:01:13.730> is

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940 
this you'll see you can see that this is

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.300 
this you'll see you can see that this is
the<00:01:14.060> first<00:01:14.330> attempt<00:01:14.840> here<00:01:15.050> and<00:01:15.380> this<00:01:16.070> is<00:01:16.130> the

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
the first attempt here and this is the

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.530 
the first attempt here and this is the
second<00:01:16.700> i'm<00:01:16.760> getting<00:01:16.970> a<00:01:17.030> little<00:01:17.060> bit<00:01:17.360> better

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
second i'm getting a little bit better

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.510 
second i'm getting a little bit better
at<00:01:17.750> my<00:01:17.870> soldering<00:01:18.290> but<00:01:18.560> i'm<00:01:18.710> certainly<00:01:19.280> not<00:01:19.460> a

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
at my soldering but i'm certainly not a

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.170 
at my soldering but i'm certainly not a
pro<00:01:19.820> yet<00:01:20.320> but<00:01:21.320> it's<00:01:21.410> be<00:01:22.070> we're<00:01:22.760> making<00:01:22.880> a<00:01:23.060> lot

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
pro yet but it's be we're making a lot

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:49.969 
pro yet but it's be we're making a lot
of<00:01:23.210> progress<00:01:23.450> here

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.380 

great<00:01:50.979> so<00:01:51.220> let's<00:01:51.310> see<00:01:51.520> how<00:01:51.580> we're<00:01:51.760> doing<00:01:51.790> here

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
great so let's see how we're doing here

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.930 
great so let's see how we're doing here
I've<00:01:52.930> got<00:01:53.350> the<00:01:53.920> drive<00:01:54.340> motor<00:01:54.610> circuitry

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
I've got the drive motor circuitry

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.530 
I've got the drive motor circuitry
mounted<00:01:57.940> on<00:01:58.060> the<00:01:58.210> prototype<00:01:59.110> PCB<00:01:59.680> and<00:02:00.540> the

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 
mounted on the prototype PCB and the

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.109 
mounted on the prototype PCB and the
steering<00:02:02.080> motor<00:02:02.320> circuitry<00:02:02.890> also<00:02:03.250> on<00:02:03.399> the<00:02:03.580> PCB

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
steering motor circuitry also on the PCB

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:06.060 
steering motor circuitry also on the PCB
and<00:02:04.780> you<00:02:04.869> may<00:02:04.990> recall<00:02:05.170> that<00:02:05.410> they're

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
and you may recall that they're

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.969 
and you may recall that they're
identical<00:02:06.460> circuits<00:02:07.560> they<00:02:08.560> just<00:02:08.860> have

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
identical circuits they just have

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.610 
identical circuits they just have
signals<00:02:09.399> provided<00:02:09.600> independently<00:02:10.620> that

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
signals provided independently that

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.620 
signals provided independently that
allows<00:02:11.860> us<00:02:11.890> to<00:02:12.280> test<00:02:12.520> them<00:02:12.700> independently<00:02:13.300> as

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
allows us to test them independently as

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.350 
allows us to test them independently as
well<00:02:14.170> so<00:02:15.040> let's<00:02:15.280> have<00:02:15.580> a<00:02:15.640> look<00:02:15.730> and<00:02:16.060> see<00:02:16.120> how

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
well so let's have a look and see how

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.490 
well so let's have a look and see how
this<00:02:16.540> works<00:02:17.200> so<00:02:17.910> these<00:02:18.910> are<00:02:18.970> red<00:02:19.600> and<00:02:19.840> green

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
this works so these are red and green

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.210 
this works so these are red and green
cables<00:02:21.190> are<00:02:21.430> effectively<00:02:22.360> our<00:02:22.660> h0<00:02:23.500> and<00:02:23.709> h1<00:02:23.830> or

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
cables are effectively our h0 and h1 or

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.760 
cables are effectively our h0 and h1 or
h2<00:02:24.989> and<00:02:25.989> h3<00:02:26.050> signals<00:02:26.950> off<00:02:27.160> the<00:02:27.370> spot<00:02:28.620> but<00:02:29.620> we're

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
h2 and h3 signals off the spot but we're

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:30.990 
h2 and h3 signals off the spot but we're
just<00:02:29.800> testing<00:02:30.160> it<00:02:30.370> without<00:02:30.610> the<00:02:30.760> spot

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
just testing it without the spot

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.270 
just testing it without the spot
initially<00:02:31.570> so<00:02:32.320> if<00:02:32.380> we<00:02:32.440> click<00:02:32.769> those<00:02:33.010> you<00:02:33.160> can

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
initially so if we click those you can

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.990 
initially so if we click those you can
see<00:02:33.459> that<00:02:34.260> it's<00:02:35.260> turning<00:02:35.739> on<00:02:35.860> going<00:02:36.610> in<00:02:36.850> one

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
see that it's turning on going in one

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.789 
see that it's turning on going in one
direction<00:02:37.030> I<00:02:37.630> put<00:02:38.080> them<00:02:38.170> both<00:02:38.290> down<00:02:38.500> that

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
direction I put them both down that

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:41.039 
direction I put them both down that
would<00:02:38.890> be<00:02:38.980> them<00:02:39.370> both<00:02:39.549> on<00:02:39.810> focus<00:02:40.810> yellow

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:41.049 
would be them both on focus yellow

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:47.699 
would be them both on focus yellow
opposite<00:02:41.799> direction<00:02:44.430> clockwise<00:02:46.709> comments

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
opposite direction clockwise comments

00:02:47.709 --> 00:03:03.560 
opposite direction clockwise comments
off<00:02:47.890> line<00:02:50.070> so<00:02:51.070> it<00:02:51.190> works<00:02:51.400> nicely

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.540 

alright<00:03:04.570> so<00:03:04.750> that's<00:03:04.960> circuit<00:03:05.500> together<00:03:05.620> let's

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
alright so that's circuit together let's

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.180 
alright so that's circuit together let's
try<00:03:06.820> this<00:03:06.880> again<00:03:07.590> got<00:03:08.590> this<00:03:08.770> connector<00:03:09.610> here

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
try this again got this connector here

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.930 
try this again got this connector here
is<00:03:12.190> for<00:03:12.870> cable<00:03:13.870> connector<00:03:14.680> we've<00:03:15.130> got<00:03:15.370> ground

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
is for cable connector we've got ground

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.230 
is for cable connector we've got ground
power<00:03:16.330> and<00:03:17.320> these<00:03:18.010> are<00:03:18.160> our<00:03:18.190> two<00:03:18.490> signals<00:03:18.970> they

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:19.240 
power and these are our two signals they

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.920 
power and these are our two signals they
correspond<00:03:20.020> to<00:03:20.110> our<00:03:20.530> high-current<00:03:21.660> pins<00:03:22.660> on

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
correspond to our high-current pins on

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.010 
correspond to our high-current pins on
the<00:03:23.250> sunspot<00:03:24.250> right<00:03:25.240> now<00:03:25.360> I<00:03:25.420> got<00:03:25.750> this

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.020 
the sunspot right now I got this

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.000 
the sunspot right now I got this
connected<00:03:26.560> so<00:03:26.770> that<00:03:28.110> we<00:03:29.110> can<00:03:29.290> see<00:03:29.740> if<00:03:29.830> this

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
connected so that we can see if this

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.100 
connected so that we can see if this
motor<00:03:30.250> is<00:03:30.340> going<00:03:30.520> to<00:03:30.580> work<00:03:30.780> and<00:03:33.870> the<00:03:34.870> same

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
motor is going to work and the same

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:36.870 
motor is going to work and the same
signal<00:03:35.530> applies<00:03:35.800> to<00:03:36.040> either<00:03:36.100> steering<00:03:36.550> or<00:03:36.730> the

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
signal applies to either steering or the

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:42.930 
signal applies to either steering or the
axle<00:03:37.800> so<00:03:38.800> we'll<00:03:38.950> try<00:03:39.160> this<00:03:41.580> as<00:03:42.580> in<00:03:42.790> that

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
axle so we'll try this as in that

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:48.030 
axle so we'll try this as in that
direction<00:03:43.380> put<00:03:44.380> these<00:03:44.500> both<00:03:44.740> on<00:03:46.920> there's<00:03:47.920> in

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
direction put these both on there's in

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.460 
direction put these both on there's in
the<00:03:48.100> other<00:03:48.220> direction<00:03:48.430> that's<00:03:49.210> good<00:03:49.510> so<00:03:50.350> now

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
the other direction that's good so now

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.280 
the other direction that's good so now
let's<00:03:50.740> try<00:03:50.980> it<00:03:51.040> on<00:03:51.190> the<00:03:51.340> other<00:03:51.460> side<00:03:52.240> and<00:03:52.540> with

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
let's try it on the other side and with

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.070 
let's try it on the other side and with
this<00:03:54.030> connector<00:03:55.030> we<00:03:55.150> can<00:03:55.300> just<00:03:55.390> pop<00:03:55.630> this<00:03:55.870> off

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 
this connector we can just pop this off

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.140 
this connector we can just pop this off
and<00:03:57.510> place<00:03:58.510> it<00:03:58.690> on<00:03:58.750> the<00:03:58.780> other<00:03:59.050> motor

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
and place it on the other motor

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.840 
and place it on the other motor
controller<00:04:01.890> and<00:04:02.890> we'll<00:04:03.040> plug<00:04:03.250> this<00:04:03.430> in<00:04:03.640> over

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850 
controller and we'll plug this in over

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:13.610 
controller and we'll plug this in over
here<00:04:06.000> there<00:04:07.000> and<00:04:07.620> let's<00:04:08.620> try<00:04:08.800> it<00:04:08.860> on<00:04:08.950> this<00:04:09.130> side

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:36.520 

good<00:04:15.390> try<00:04:16.390> the<00:04:16.450> reverse<00:04:16.660> direction<00:04:21.930> excellent

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.020 

alright<00:04:37.530> so<00:04:37.740> we<00:04:37.860> want<00:04:38.040> to<00:04:38.130> test<00:04:38.310> this<00:04:38.520> cable

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
alright so we want to test this cable

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.510 
alright so we want to test this cable
here<00:04:39.060> this<00:04:39.810> cables<00:04:40.230> going<00:04:40.440> in<00:04:40.680> to<00:04:41.130> the<00:04:41.250> spot

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
here this cables going in to the spot

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.360 
here this cables going in to the spot
it's<00:04:41.850> using<00:04:42.270> ground<00:04:42.720> pin<00:04:43.080> high<00:04:43.440> voltage<00:04:44.010> and

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
it's using ground pin high voltage and

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.710 
it's using ground pin high voltage and
the<00:04:45.330> for<00:04:45.570> hike<00:04:45.810> and<00:04:46.020> for<00:04:46.410> high<00:04:46.530> currents<00:04:47.720> 80

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
the for hike and for high currents 80

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.620 
the for hike and for high currents 80
through<00:04:48.990> h3<00:04:49.860> it<00:04:50.760> goes<00:04:50.940> through<00:04:51.120> this<00:04:51.210> cable<00:04:51.450> on

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
through h3 it goes through this cable on

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.930 
through h3 it goes through this cable on
and<00:04:51.870> on<00:04:52.050> to<00:04:52.170> this<00:04:52.290> board<00:04:52.620> so<00:04:53.280> I<00:04:53.310> program<00:04:53.700> these

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
and on to this board so I program these

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.820 
and on to this board so I program these
two<00:04:54.150> switches<00:04:54.720> to<00:04:54.960> represent<00:04:55.440> our<00:04:55.560> drive

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
two switches to represent our drive

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.000 
two switches to represent our drive
motors<00:04:56.220> and<00:04:56.490> steering<00:04:56.880> motors<00:04:57.210> and<00:04:57.590> I've<00:04:58.590> got

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010 
motors and steering motors and I've got

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:00.650 
motors and steering motors and I've got
it<00:04:59.130> I<00:04:59.310> have<00:04:59.430> to<00:04:59.550> push<00:04:59.760> this<00:04:59.910> down<00:05:00.120> because<00:05:00.360> not

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
it I have to push this down because not

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.380 
it I have to push this down because not
enough<00:05:00.750> tension<00:05:01.140> on<00:05:01.380> the<00:05:01.530> pins<00:05:01.800> here<00:05:02.100> to<00:05:02.460> stay

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:03.390 
enough tension on the pins here to stay

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:06.500 
enough tension on the pins here to stay
firm<00:05:03.750> on<00:05:03.960> the<00:05:04.050> breadboard<00:05:04.550> so<00:05:05.550> let's<00:05:06.330> see<00:05:06.420> what

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510 
firm on the breadboard so let's see what

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:07.790 
firm on the breadboard so let's see what
happens<00:05:06.840> like<00:05:06.960> you<00:05:06.990> can<00:05:07.290> see<00:05:07.410> I<00:05:07.440> don't<00:05:07.680> know<00:05:07.740> if

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
happens like you can see I don't know if

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.320 
happens like you can see I don't know if
you<00:05:07.860> can<00:05:07.950> see<00:05:08.100> this<00:05:08.220> light<00:05:08.580> here<00:05:08.850> it's<00:05:09.000> blue

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
you can see this light here it's blue

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.690 
you can see this light here it's blue
and<00:05:09.630> that<00:05:10.440> is<00:05:10.740> telling<00:05:11.070> me<00:05:11.160> that<00:05:11.280> I<00:05:11.340> have<00:05:11.430> power

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:11.700 
and that is telling me that I have power

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.270 
and that is telling me that I have power
to<00:05:11.940> the<00:05:12.030> system<00:05:12.350> so<00:05:13.350> when<00:05:13.950> I<00:05:14.010> press<00:05:14.250> this

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
to the system so when I press this

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:19.910 
to the system so when I press this
button<00:05:14.930> the<00:05:15.930> switch<00:05:17.480> you'll<00:05:18.480> see<00:05:18.870> the<00:05:19.200> LEDs<00:05:19.710> on

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:19.920 
button the switch you'll see the LEDs on

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.000 
button the switch you'll see the LEDs on
the<00:05:20.010> spot<00:05:20.370> come<00:05:20.790> on<00:05:20.970> and<00:05:21.350> some<00:05:22.350> activity<00:05:22.890> on

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.010 
the spot come on and some activity on

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:26.750 
the spot come on and some activity on
the<00:05:23.160> test<00:05:23.430> circuit<00:05:24.020> so<00:05:25.020> this<00:05:25.860> represents<00:05:26.070> both

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
the test circuit so this represents both

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.320 
the test circuit so this represents both
relays<00:05:27.330> being<00:05:27.660> energized<00:05:28.260> and<00:05:29.000> this<00:05:30.000> is<00:05:30.180> only

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330 
relays being energized and this is only

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:34.940 
relays being energized and this is only
one<00:05:31.250> go<00:05:32.250> to<00:05:32.310> the<00:05:32.400> other<00:05:32.460> motor<00:05:33.500> here's<00:05:34.500> one

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:34.950 
one go to the other motor here's one

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:36.710 
one go to the other motor here's one
relay<00:05:35.310> being<00:05:35.670> energized<00:05:36.120> that's<00:05:36.360> the<00:05:36.480> drive

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 
relay being energized that's the drive

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:43.610 
relay being energized that's the drive
and<00:05:37.700> then<00:05:38.700> both<00:05:40.130> being<00:05:41.130> energized<00:05:42.530> so<00:05:43.530> it

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620 
and then both being energized so it

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.430 
and then both being energized so it
looks<00:05:43.800> like<00:05:43.860> our<00:05:44.070> software<00:05:44.460> is<00:05:44.670> working<00:05:44.700> and

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.440 
looks like our software is working and

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:50.650 
looks like our software is working and
we're<00:05:46.440> getting<00:05:46.740> the<00:05:46.890> expected<00:05:48.470> signals<00:05:49.470> on

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:50.660 
we're getting the expected signals on

00:05:50.660 --> 00:06:45.030 
we're getting the expected signals on
our<00:05:51.660> spot<00:05:52.020> from<00:05:52.410> our<00:05:52.590> spot

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:45.040 

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.100
