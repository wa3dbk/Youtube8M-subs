00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
more since what I think they're doing is

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.530 
more since what I think they're doing is
trying<00:03:33.840> to<00:03:34.530> meld<00:03:35.160> both<00:03:35.609> the<00:03:35.819> franchises<00:03:36.420> or

trying to meld both the franchises or

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.930 
trying to meld both the franchises or
keep<00:03:36.720> them<00:03:36.930> separate<00:03:37.410> would<00:03:38.340> be<00:03:38.459> better<00:03:38.609> in<00:03:38.819> my

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
keep them separate would be better in my

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.729 
keep them separate would be better in my
opinion<00:03:39.030> but<00:03:39.359> that's<00:03:39.540> another<00:03:39.720> video<00:03:39.900> but

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
opinion but that's another video but

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.210 
basically I just want to touch upon that
with<00:03:42.780> you<00:03:42.870> guys<00:03:43.049> and<00:03:43.470> let<00:03:43.530> you<00:03:43.739> guys<00:03:43.859> know<00:03:44.069> that

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
with you guys and let you guys know that

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.160 
with you guys and let you guys know that
that<00:03:44.340> was<00:03:44.489> not<00:03:44.760> Scarlet<00:03:45.480> Witch<00:03:45.630> so<00:03:45.780> that<00:03:45.930> was

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
that was not Scarlet Witch so that was

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.039 
that was not Scarlet Witch so that was
Polaris<00:03:46.829> I<00:03:47.069> can<00:03:47.760> pretty<00:03:48.120> much<00:03:48.239> confirm<00:03:48.870> this

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
Polaris I can pretty much confirm this

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:50.870 
Polaris I can pretty much confirm this
because<00:03:49.470> like<00:03:49.769> everyone<00:03:50.280> knows<00:03:50.489> like<00:03:50.639> I<00:03:50.819> know

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
because like everyone knows like I know

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.870 
because like everyone knows like I know
Quicksilver<00:03:51.720> Scarlet<00:03:52.049> Witch<00:03:52.139> are<00:03:52.350> twins<00:03:52.880> so

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
Quicksilver Scarlet Witch are twins so

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.059 
Quicksilver Scarlet Witch are twins so
they'll<00:03:54.299> be<00:03:54.480> born<00:03:54.720> at<00:03:54.810> the<00:03:54.870> same<00:03:55.049> time<00:03:55.380> so

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
they'll be born at the same time so

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.559 
they'll be born at the same time so
probably<00:03:56.459> he<00:03:56.549> doesn't<00:03:56.819> even<00:03:57.030> so<00:03:57.269> probably

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
probably he doesn't even so probably

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:59.770 
probably he doesn't even so probably
he's<00:03:57.810> convinced<00:03:58.319> that's<00:03:58.470> his<00:03:58.650> only<00:03:58.859> sister

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
he's convinced that's his only sister

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.240 
he's convinced that's his only sister
because<00:04:00.780> the<00:04:00.900> mom<00:04:01.079> probably<00:04:01.590> never<00:04:01.859> said

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
because the mom probably never said

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.120 
because the mom probably never said
anything<00:04:02.430> about<00:04:02.760> it<00:04:03.500> he<00:04:04.500> barely<00:04:04.739> knows<00:04:05.010> who

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
anything about it he barely knows who

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:06.530 
anything about it he barely knows who
his<00:04:05.280> father<00:04:05.489> is<00:04:05.670> you're<00:04:05.849> the<00:04:05.910> new<00:04:06.060> you<00:04:06.329> think

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
his father is you're the new you think

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.479 
his father is you're the new you think
you're<00:04:06.630> gonna<00:04:06.720> tell<00:04:07.019> him<00:04:07.260> he's<00:04:07.920> got<00:04:08.099> a<00:04:08.130> sister

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
you're gonna tell him he's got a sister

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:10.400 
you're gonna tell him he's got a sister
held<00:04:08.880> up<00:04:09.030> in<00:04:09.150> a<00:04:09.269> maximum-security<00:04:09.870> prison

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
held up in a maximum-security prison

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.949 
held up in a maximum-security prison
he's<00:04:11.130> gonna<00:04:11.280> break<00:04:11.609> her<00:04:11.819> out<00:04:11.849> also<00:04:12.239> which<00:04:12.810> I

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
he's gonna break her out also which I

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:14.599 
he's gonna break her out also which I
think<00:04:13.260> could<00:04:13.380> be<00:04:13.560> another<00:04:13.829> scene<00:04:14.190> or

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:14.609 
think could be another scene or
