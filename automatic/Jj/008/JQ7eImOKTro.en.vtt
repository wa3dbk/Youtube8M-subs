00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:20.320
 hello beauties welcome to my channel in 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:23.800
 this time we are going to start with a 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:26.439
 base of shades of white color this 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.780
 because I want the color neutralized 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:34.210
 of the skin pretty well 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:34.210
 and I'm going to scatter it perfectly 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:41.960
 then I will continue with a pigment 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:44.829
 very bright sand color and I'm going to 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.559
 put on the mobile eyelid 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:50.859
 I want it to be well impregnated 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:54.690
 this color on the eyelid and also what 

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:54.690
 I'm going to apply on the lacrimal 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:02.150
 I'm going to continue delineating the lashes 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:05.180
 top with this black eyeliner the 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:10.380
 pencil will remain that is indelible and I will 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:13.560
 make a wing and a little thick at the end 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:17.570
 which I will use as a base for 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.570
 define the eye socket 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:23.180
 and quite extended this line first 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:27.610
 I'm going to put it very thin and then the 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.610
 I'm going to swell as much as I can 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:34.240
 with this same eyeliner 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:39.310
 to then blur it with a brush 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:41.020
 very thin and I'm going to start all the 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.220
 I will blur the edges upwards 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.220
 as much as possible 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:54.360
 then I'm going to add this shadow of 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:58.119
 matte coffee color and I'll use it to 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.640
 that miss that black in the eyeliner 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:03.390
 little by little and I'm going to apply it to 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.390
 taps 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.440
 then I'm going to blur it pretty well 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.450
 up because I want you to miss 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:18.060
 a bit the tonality towards the bone 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:19.980
 eyebrow and I'm going to add this shadow of 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:24.030
 black color with a pretty brush 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:29.630
 thin and I'm going to define that again 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.630
 edge with the mobile eyelid 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.400
 in a very very diffuse way 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:45.540
 then I'm going to take this jumbo pencil in 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:48.710
 milk and I'm going to blur it pretty well 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.710
 in the bone of the eyebrow 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:56.090
 I'm going to add this very white shadow 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.739
 bright and I'll place it where 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.540
 had put the pencil jumbo in the 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:03.519
 that in the eyebrow bone to 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.519
 illuminate that area quite 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:11.130
 then I continue with this eyeliner 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:15.150
 black again and I'm going to mark the 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:17.580
 lower lashes without reaching the 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.630
 animal is more the line I'm going to focus 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.630
 down 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:28.530
 then I'm going to blur this line with 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.269
 brown shade of the same as 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.849
 have previously used is very 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:35.310
 dark and I'm going to swell 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:41.280
 blur the and swell the pretty 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:44.670
 from the tear to the corner of 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:49.409
 outside and I'm also going to lengthen the eye 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:52.769
 from the lower delineation to the wing 

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:55.170
 superior and here then added quite 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:58.349
 mascara because it's the start 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:00.650
 of thickening both above and 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:00.650
 down 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:07.709
 then I will re-dial the line 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:11.819
 that he had created with pencil eyeliner and 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:14.270
 this time it will be with gel too 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:17.669
 they can do it with liquid eyeliner 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:19.790
 but I recommend the gel more 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:23.290
 can blur better 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:25.640
 and I'm also going to mark the eye socket 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:28.730
 only on the edge I want it to be 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.930
 ok well mark that line because it's going to 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:33.890
 be the one that will mark us 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:38.110
 final depth and I'm going to blur it 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:38.110
 with brown shade 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:51.480
 in the water line I'm going to add a 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:55.400
 dark brown pencil eyeliner 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.400
 because I do not want to miss 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:01.520
 the intensity of all the shadows that 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.520
 has abroad 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:07.520
 then I will add the tabs 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:09.200
 plate that are individual and here 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.210
 if they keep having enough 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:14.630
 patience but this is what is going to 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:17.840
 achieve a pretty look kim kardashian 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:21.620
 of very very disheveled eyelashes and 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:25.969
 very very long I'm going to add a mask 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:28.819
 of black eyelashes at the base of 

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:31.209
 of the lashes and I'm going to extend it 

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:34.400
 out both up and down 

00:05:31.209 --> 00:05:38.620
 enough enough layers 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.620
 and this is the final result 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:56.920
 I brought them makeup that is like 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:59.560
 a little seventies 

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:03.430
 but combine it at the same time with a 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:05.560
 image of Kim Kardashian who has the 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:07.670
 the stunning makeovers 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:11.150

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:13.889

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:16.020
 liked it is very funny 

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:18.120
 I hope they are made as for a 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:20.939
 party you can lower the volume and you 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:23.969
 take them to a normal party or you can 

00:06:20.939 --> 00:06:27.409
 serve at night like this or they take it like that 

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:27.409
 as a costume for halloween 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:33.630
