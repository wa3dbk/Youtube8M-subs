00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 so today I'm going to teach you 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:09.809
 how to make paper bird 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:14.340
 fly then to do this you need 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:17.910
 a sheet a4 so you bend to the menu 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.380
 like this to make a line you 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:28.019
 follow this trail you put the 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:29.730
 breast ends here now you 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:51.360
 you bend the ends again one 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:53.340
 worry and you take the beak 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:59.879
 that it makes you go beyond a small 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:05.369
 little on the other side you fold the 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:09.290
 extremes again at the center the 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.290
 ends for the center 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:29.259
 and give you a shape like these 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:34.390
 bend it in that sense in that sense and 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:35.579
 you get that now you have to do 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:42.390
 the beak of the bird 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:45.940
 so you have to bend the beak like these 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:50.470
 and thanks to the folds you unfold and you 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:55.149
 cdec of you and then you fold 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:58.240
 take the little beak and draw it a 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:01.270
 little bit so that it looks like 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:07.840

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:11.260
