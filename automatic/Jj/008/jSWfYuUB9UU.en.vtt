00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.000
[MUSIC "HIGH ON THE MOUNTAIN
 TOP"]

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.600
(SINGING) High on the mountain
top a banner is unfurled.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:33.300
Ye nations, now look up;
it waves to all the world.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:43.200
In Deseret's sweet, peaceful
land, on Zion's mount behold

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.800
it stand!

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.000
For God remembers
still his promise

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.100
made of old that he
on Zion's hill truth's

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.600
standard would unfold!

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.800
Her light should
there attract the gaze

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.300
of all the world in latter days.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.200
His house shall there be
reared, his glory to display,

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.200
and people shall be heard
in distant lands to say:

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:09.900
We'll now go up and serve
the Lord, obey his truth,

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.700
and learn his word.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.000
For there we shall be
taught the law that

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.500
will go forth, with
truth and wisdom fraught,

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.100
to govern all the earth.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:53.400
Forever there his
ways we'll tread,

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.800
and save ourselves
with all our dead.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.800
High on the mountain top
a banner is unfurled.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:15.300
Amen.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.000
Amen.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.050
Amen.
