be<00:00:14.280> discussed<00:00:14.580> and<00:00:15.000> how<00:00:15.120> it<00:00:15.240> affects<00:00:15.570> the

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
at either 48 or 60 as well and that's a

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.760 
at either 48 or 60 as well and that's a
big<00:00:36.270> deal<00:00:36.480> they<00:00:36.750> had<00:00:36.899> some<00:00:37.079> examples<00:00:37.559> showing

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
big deal they had some examples showing

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.319 
big deal they had some examples showing
this<00:00:37.980> off<00:00:38.160> it<00:00:38.370> was<00:00:38.489> very<00:00:38.700> cool<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:38.969> see<00:00:39.180> this

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
this off it was very cool to see this

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.330 
this off it was very cool to see this
stuff<00:00:39.540> running<00:00:39.750> in<00:00:39.930> action<00:00:40.320> but<00:00:40.920> overall<00:00:41.190> I

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
stuff running in action but overall I

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.889 
stuff running in action but overall I
think<00:00:41.610> it's<00:00:41.969> um<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:42.450> think<00:00:42.510> it's<00:00:42.780> really

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
think it's um I think it's really

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.450 
think it's um I think it's really
important<00:00:43.410> for<00:00:43.440> me<00:00:43.620> not<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.040> lot<00:00:44.219> of<00:00:44.340> people

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
important for me not a lot of people

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.340 
important for me not a lot of people
understand<00:00:45.030> why<00:00:45.210> higher<00:00:45.510> frame<00:00:45.840> rates<00:00:46.079> are

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
understand why higher frame rates are

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.160 
understand why higher frame rates are
that<00:00:46.590> important<00:00:47.100> especially<00:00:47.640> for<00:00:47.940> games<00:00:48.390> when

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
that important especially for games when

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.540 
that important especially for games when
we're<00:00:49.320> talking<00:00:49.410> about<00:00:49.620> games<00:00:49.980> specifically

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
we're talking about games specifically

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.369 
we're talking about games specifically
when<00:00:51.059> you<00:00:51.180> have<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.390> game<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:51.870> it's<00:00:52.020> running<00:00:52.170> at

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
when you have a game and it's running at

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.410 
when you have a game and it's running at
30<00:00:52.649> frames<00:00:52.890> per<00:00:53.129> second<00:00:53.640> you<00:00:53.910> only<00:00:54.120> get<00:00:54.390> so

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
30 frames per second you only get so

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.619 
30 frames per second you only get so
much<00:00:54.870> time<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.350> input<00:00:55.829> commands<00:00:56.640> for<00:00:57.149> example

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
much time to input commands for example

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.630 
much time to input commands for example
if<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:58.140> have<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.289> character<00:00:58.710> on<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.829> jump<00:00:59.190> art<00:00:59.430> in

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
if you have a character on a jump art in

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.130 
if you have a character on a jump art in
Street<00:00:59.940> Fighter<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.359> they're<00:01:00.510> jumping<00:01:00.899> in<00:01:01.020> at

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
Street Fighter and they're jumping in at

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.380 
Street Fighter and they're jumping in at
you<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.590> you<00:01:01.949> only<00:01:01.980> had<00:01:02.280> about<00:01:02.370> 30<00:01:02.760> frames<00:01:03.149> to

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
you and you only had about 30 frames to

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.969 
you and you only had about 30 frames to
upper<00:01:03.660> cut<00:01:03.690> them<00:01:03.989> before<00:01:04.260> they<00:01:04.409> come<00:01:04.619> in<00:01:04.830> if

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
upper cut them before they come in if

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.429 
upper cut them before they come in if
you<00:01:05.610> are<00:01:05.640> actually<00:01:06.030> running<00:01:06.360> at<00:01:06.600> 60<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.260> get

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
you are actually running at 60 you get

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.380 
you are actually running at 60 you get
twice<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.860> amount<00:01:08.220> of<00:01:08.460> time<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.880> input<00:01:09.240> that

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
twice the amount of time to input that

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.600 
twice the amount of time to input that
command<00:01:09.810> every<00:01:10.020> second<00:01:10.650> it's<00:01:11.189> that<00:01:11.430> your

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
command every second it's that your

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.460 
command every second it's that your
input<00:01:12.090> actually<00:01:12.540> hits<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.930> screen<00:01:13.229> more

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
input actually hits the screen more

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.289 
input actually hits the screen more
precisely<00:01:14.010> than<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:14.549> does<00:01:14.729> running<00:01:15.030> at<00:01:15.210> a

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
precisely than it does running at a

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.580 
precisely than it does running at a
lower<00:01:15.479> frame<00:01:15.810> rate<00:01:15.869> that's<00:01:16.229> what's<00:01:16.439> really

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
lower frame rate that's what's really

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.770 
lower frame rate that's what's really
critical<00:01:16.950> about<00:01:17.490> frame<00:01:17.909> rate<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.330> why<00:01:18.720> it

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
critical about frame rate and why it

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.719 
critical about frame rate and why it
actually<00:01:19.229> affects<00:01:19.320> things<00:01:19.890> like<00:01:20.189> gameplay

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
actually affects things like gameplay

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.789 
actually affects things like gameplay
frame<00:01:21.360> rate<00:01:21.570> absolutely<00:01:22.259> does<00:01:22.409> not<00:01:22.560> make

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
frame rate absolutely does not make

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.219 
frame rate absolutely does not make
better<00:01:23.130> games<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:23.939> does<00:01:24.119> not<00:01:24.270> make<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:25.110> know

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
better games it does not make you know

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.440 
better games it does not make you know
crappy<00:01:25.619> games<00:01:25.979> absolutely<00:01:26.610> amazing<00:01:27.090> all<00:01:27.270> it

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
crappy games absolutely amazing all it

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.060 
crappy games absolutely amazing all it
does<00:01:27.600> is<00:01:27.810> just<00:01:27.990> offer<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.409> level<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:28.860> refinement

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
does is just offer a level of refinement

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.090 
does is just offer a level of refinement
for<00:01:29.670> games<00:01:29.880> that<00:01:30.210> is<00:01:30.390> absolutely<00:01:31.380> awesome<00:01:31.650> and

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100

for games that is absolutely awesome and
has<00:01:32.310> been<00:01:32.549> there<00:01:32.759> since<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.090> nintendo<00:01:34.020> that

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
has been there since the nintendo that

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.350 
has been there since the nintendo that
has<00:01:34.770> been<00:01:35.009> there<00:01:35.189> since<00:01:35.430> as<00:01:35.640> long<00:01:35.670> as<00:01:36.119> we<00:01:36.240> can

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
has been there since as long as we can

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.789 
has been there since as long as we can
possibly<00:01:36.420> remember<00:01:37.110> it's<00:01:37.409> just<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:37.710> it

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
possibly remember it's just that it

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.340 
possibly remember it's just that it
hasn't<00:01:37.920> become<00:01:38.310> very<00:01:39.150> very<00:01:39.810> much<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.049> staple

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
hasn't become very very much a staple

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.990 
hasn't become very very much a staple
over<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.829> majority<00:01:41.189> of<00:01:41.220> games<00:01:41.369> nowadays<00:01:41.670> but

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000

running<00:01:46.829> at<00:01:46.920> 60<00:01:47.189> frames<00:01:47.220> per<00:01:47.490> second<00:01:47.880> is<00:01:47.939> that

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
running at 60 frames per second is that

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.090 
running at 60 frames per second is that
it<00:01:48.119> doesn't<00:01:48.360> affect<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.990> gameplay<00:01:49.229> at<00:01:49.860> all

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
it doesn't affect the gameplay at all

it doesn't affect the gameplay at all
all<00:01:50.369> you're<00:01:50.640> doing<00:01:50.670> is<00:01:51.149> watching<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.750> video<00:01:51.930> but

actually looks like I've gone through
many<00:02:05.820> different<00:02:06.030> methods<00:02:06.450> myself<00:02:06.869> to<00:02:07.020> try<00:02:07.170> to

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
many different methods myself to try to

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.960 
many different methods myself to try to

little<00:02:09.239> tricks<00:02:09.629> from<00:02:09.780> my<00:02:09.959> guilty<00:02:10.319> gear<00:02:10.470> video

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
little tricks from my guilty gear video

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:11.360 
little tricks from my guilty gear video
so<00:02:10.979> that<00:02:11.099> you

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
so that you

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.710 
so that you
can<00:02:11.580> actually<00:02:11.879> see<00:02:12.150> what<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.510> game<00:02:12.690> looks

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
can actually see what the game looks

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.770 
can actually see what the game looks
like<00:02:13.290> at<00:02:13.500> its<00:02:13.950> natural<00:02:14.549> frame<00:02:14.819> rate<00:02:15.060> and<00:02:15.239> it's

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
like at its natural frame rate and it's

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.750 
like at its natural frame rate and it's
important<00:02:16.470> to<00:02:16.560> see<00:02:16.709> the<00:02:16.860> difference<00:02:17.250> i'll

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
important to see the difference i'll

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.490 
important to see the difference i'll
also<00:02:17.940> be<00:02:18.180> putting<00:02:18.420> up<00:02:18.510> a<00:02:18.599> video<00:02:18.750> once<00:02:19.049> we<00:02:19.230> do<00:02:19.349> go

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
also be putting up a video once we do go

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.440 
also be putting up a video once we do go
live<00:02:19.739> with<00:02:19.860> 60<00:02:20.159> frames<00:02:20.370> per<00:02:20.430> second<00:02:20.879> showing

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
live with 60 frames per second showing

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.509 
live with 60 frames per second showing
you<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.659> differences<00:02:22.019> between<00:02:22.080> like<00:02:22.560> 15<00:02:23.099> to

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
you the differences between like 15 to

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:26.990 
you the differences between like 15 to
24<00:02:24.060> to<00:02:24.420> 30<00:02:24.780> to<00:02:25.049> 48<00:02:25.409> to<00:02:25.680> 60<00:02:26.159> so<00:02:26.670> you<00:02:26.760> can<00:02:26.849> actually

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
24 to 30 to 48 to 60 so you can actually

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.550 
24 to 30 to 48 to 60 so you can actually
get<00:02:27.209> an<00:02:27.299> understanding<00:02:27.420> of<00:02:27.900> what's<00:02:28.079> going<00:02:28.290> on

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
get an understanding of what's going on

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.680 
get an understanding of what's going on
but<00:02:29.099> now<00:02:29.250> we<00:02:29.310> actually<00:02:29.610> are<00:02:30.000> going<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:30.209> get<00:02:30.360> the

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
but now we actually are going to get the

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.289 
but now we actually are going to get the
full<00:02:30.930> capacity<00:02:31.230> and<00:02:31.920> the<00:02:31.950> ability<00:02:32.069> to<00:02:32.790> do<00:02:33.030> this

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
full capacity and the ability to do this

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:35.479 
full capacity and the ability to do this
and<00:02:33.569> it's<00:02:34.290> something<00:02:34.500> I<00:02:34.709> never<00:02:34.769> thought<00:02:35.069> that

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
and it's something I never thought that

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.550 
and it's something I never thought that
we'd<00:02:35.640> ever<00:02:35.790> really<00:02:36.420> get<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:36.930> chance<00:02:37.170> to<00:02:37.290> use

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
we'd ever really get the chance to use

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.890 
we'd ever really get the chance to use
on<00:02:37.769> YouTube<00:02:38.159> I<00:02:38.370> thought<00:02:38.579> the<00:02:39.060> extra<00:02:39.390> 30<00:02:39.569> frames

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
on YouTube I thought the extra 30 frames

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.990 
on YouTube I thought the extra 30 frames
would<00:02:40.170> really<00:02:40.709> be<00:02:40.829> unnecessary<00:02:41.519> and<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:41.790> only

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
would really be unnecessary and the only

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.390 
would really be unnecessary and the only
thing<00:02:42.299> that's<00:02:42.690> honestly<00:02:43.140> good<00:02:43.440> for<00:02:43.709> for<00:02:44.340> the

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
thing that's honestly good for for the

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.130 
thing that's honestly good for for the
most<00:02:44.579> part<00:02:44.760> is<00:02:44.910> gameplay<00:02:45.359> if<00:02:45.780> you<00:02:45.930> watch

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
most part is gameplay if you watch

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.960 
most part is gameplay if you watch
something<00:02:46.440> like<00:02:46.739> me<00:02:46.980> like<00:02:47.250> somebody<00:02:47.459> talking

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
something like me like somebody talking

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.240 
something like me like somebody talking
into<00:02:48.150> a<00:02:48.180> camera<00:02:48.629> at<00:02:48.780> 48<00:02:49.530> or<00:02:49.650> 60<00:02:49.950> frames<00:02:50.160> per

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
into a camera at 48 or 60 frames per

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.190 
into a camera at 48 or 60 frames per
second<00:02:50.700> it's<00:02:50.849> gonna<00:02:51.060> look<00:02:51.239> really<00:02:51.299> weird<00:02:51.959> and

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
second it's gonna look really weird and

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.020 
second it's gonna look really weird and
I'll<00:02:52.349> show<00:02:52.590> you<00:02:52.620> guys<00:02:52.859> this<00:02:53.099> exactly<00:02:53.760> what<00:02:54.000> I

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
I'll show you guys this exactly what I

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.509 
I'll show you guys this exactly what I
mean<00:02:54.390> when<00:02:55.019> I<00:02:55.049> get<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.410> opportunity<00:02:55.530> to<00:02:56.129> do<00:02:56.280> so

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
mean when I get the opportunity to do so

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.759 
mean when I get the opportunity to do so
it<00:02:56.730> looks<00:02:56.970> more<00:02:57.180> like<00:02:57.359> a<00:02:57.390> soap<00:02:57.750> opera<00:02:57.930> because

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
it looks more like a soap opera because

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:00.830 
it looks more like a soap opera because
so<00:02:58.950> propers<00:02:59.400> runs<00:02:59.670> sometimes<00:02:59.909> between<00:03:00.299> 30<00:03:00.720> to

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
so propers runs sometimes between 30 to

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.050 
so propers runs sometimes between 30 to
48<00:03:01.290> frames<00:03:01.680> a<00:03:01.829> second<00:03:02.190> and<00:03:02.340> it<00:03:02.700> just<00:03:02.730> looks

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
48 frames a second and it just looks

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.180 
48 frames a second and it just looks
weird<00:03:03.420> this<00:03:04.200> is<00:03:04.319> another<00:03:04.530> reason<00:03:04.620> why<00:03:04.950> I<00:03:04.980> don't

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
weird this is another reason why I don't

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.830 
weird this is another reason why I don't
like<00:03:05.250> a<00:03:05.340> lot<00:03:05.549> of<00:03:05.579> those<00:03:05.730> movies<00:03:06.269> that<00:03:06.299> run<00:03:06.690> at

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
like a lot of those movies that run at

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.229 
like a lot of those movies that run at
that<00:03:06.930> higher<00:03:07.200> emulated<00:03:07.920> framerate<00:03:08.220> like<00:03:08.579> 120

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
that higher emulated framerate like 120

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.569 
that higher emulated framerate like 120
Hertz<00:03:09.450> think<00:03:10.170> it<00:03:10.260> makes<00:03:10.409> films<00:03:10.709> look<00:03:11.069> awful

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:11.579 
Hertz think it makes films look awful

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:12.890 
Hertz think it makes films look awful
but<00:03:11.730> when<00:03:11.849> it<00:03:11.970> comes<00:03:12.209> to<00:03:12.390> games<00:03:12.599> it's<00:03:12.840> a

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
but when it comes to games it's a

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.839 
but when it comes to games it's a
different<00:03:13.260> story<00:03:13.379> and<00:03:13.829> all<00:03:14.250> I<00:03:14.280> can<00:03:14.400> tell<00:03:14.670> you

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
different story and all I can tell you

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:17.150 
different story and all I can tell you
is<00:03:15.000> that<00:03:15.030> I<00:03:15.209> have<00:03:15.510> a<00:03:15.690> just<00:03:16.349> because<00:03:16.500> it<00:03:16.859> took<00:03:17.010> us

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
is that I have a just because it took us

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.740 
is that I have a just because it took us
60<00:03:17.459> frames<00:03:17.639> per<00:03:17.730> second<00:03:18.090> is<00:03:18.150> so<00:03:18.269> important<00:03:18.720> to
