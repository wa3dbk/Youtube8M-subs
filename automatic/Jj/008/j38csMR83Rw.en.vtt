not sure you guys would remember that I

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:09.930 
not sure you guys would remember that I
would<00:04:07.510> use<00:04:07.810> this<00:04:08.080> nail<00:04:08.320> polish<00:04:08.530> as<00:04:08.950> a

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
would use this nail polish as a

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.940 
would use this nail polish as a
a<00:04:10.030> clear<00:04:10.570> coat<00:04:10.810> like<00:04:10.990> to<00:04:11.140> keep<00:04:11.320> my<00:04:11.500> nails<00:04:11.710> that

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
a clear coat like to keep my nails that

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.300 
a clear coat like to keep my nails that
kind<00:04:12.160> of<00:04:12.190> shiny<00:04:12.490> but<00:04:13.480> um<00:04:13.660> it<00:04:14.440> fades<00:04:14.650> away<00:04:14.830> I

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
kind of shiny but um it fades away I

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.720 
kind of shiny but um it fades away I
think<00:04:15.460> so<00:04:15.790> I<00:04:15.820> wouldn't<00:04:16.209> buy<00:04:16.450> that<00:04:16.480> one<00:04:16.720> anymore

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 
think so I wouldn't buy that one anymore

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:22.140 
think so I wouldn't buy that one anymore
so<00:04:18.730> that<00:04:18.760> one's<00:04:19.299> a<00:04:19.540> fail<00:04:20.519> then<00:04:21.519> the<00:04:21.640> next<00:04:21.970> thing

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
so that one's a fail then the next thing

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:23.670 
so that one's a fail then the next thing
