00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.950 
the more realistic look because the face
is<00:01:34.460> appropriate<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.579> scale<00:01:35.850> and<00:01:36.090> also<00:01:36.659> the

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
is appropriate to scale and also the

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.600 
is appropriate to scale and also the
face<00:01:37.170> should<00:01:37.409> be<00:01:37.560> more<00:01:37.860> in<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.100> corner<00:01:38.460> of

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
face should be more in the corner of

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.819 
face should be more in the corner of
that<00:01:38.820> little<00:01:39.180> symbol<00:01:39.570> but<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.200> star<00:01:40.439> is<00:01:40.470> way

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
that little symbol but the star is way

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.830 
that little symbol but the star is way
too<00:01:40.890> small<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.880> guys<00:01:42.030> can<00:01:42.240> see<00:01:42.360> on<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.600> collar

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
too small you guys can see on the collar

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.600 
too small you guys can see on the collar
that<00:01:43.110> there<00:01:43.200> is<00:01:43.350> no<00:01:43.500> fly<00:01:43.770> wire<00:01:44.070> which<00:01:44.340> is<00:01:44.460> good

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
that there is no fly wire which is good

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.219 
that there is no fly wire which is good
because<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:45.000> real<00:01:45.180> ones<00:01:45.420> do<00:01:45.570> not<00:01:45.600> have<00:01:45.930> it<00:01:46.079> and

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
because the real ones do not have it and

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.960 
because the real ones do not have it and
also<00:01:46.860> both<00:01:47.070> of<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.310> NFL<00:01:47.610> shields<00:01:47.880> are

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
also both of the NFL shields are

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.090 
also both of the NFL shields are
rubberized<00:01:48.270> so<00:01:48.689> that's<00:01:48.840> all<00:01:48.960> that<00:01:49.110> matters<00:01:49.380> so

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
rubberized so that's all that matters so

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.139 
rubberized so that's all that matters so
this<00:01:50.280> is<00:01:50.340> where<00:01:50.460> it<00:01:50.520> kind<00:01:50.729> of<00:01:50.759> gets<00:01:50.850> weird

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
this is where it kind of gets weird

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.090 
this is where it kind of gets weird
because<00:01:51.360> on<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.720> neck<00:01:51.930> tag<00:01:52.200> of<00:01:52.439> wholesale
