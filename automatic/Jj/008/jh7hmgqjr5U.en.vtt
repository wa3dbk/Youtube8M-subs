00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
the family section and kind of um I'd

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.990 
the family section and kind of um I'd
say<00:00:18.960> just<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.619> fact<00:00:19.949> that<00:00:20.130> I<00:00:20.460> think<00:00:20.730> the

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
say just the fact that I think the

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.640 
say just the fact that I think the
reason<00:00:21.150> why<00:00:21.420> we<00:00:21.600> do<00:00:21.720> this<00:00:21.869> is<00:00:22.109> really<00:00:22.350> to<00:00:22.529> make

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
reason why we do this is really to make

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.500 
reason why we do this is really to make
the<00:00:22.830> kids<00:00:23.039> smile<00:00:23.279> and<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.699> reason<00:00:24.060> why<00:00:24.210> we<00:00:24.390> do

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
the kids smile and the reason why we do

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.050 
the kids smile and the reason why we do
it<00:00:24.539> is<00:00:24.779> to<00:00:24.810> hear<00:00:25.439> their<00:00:25.619> laughs<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:26.220> put<00:00:27.029> a

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
it is to hear their laughs and put a

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.339 
it is to hear their laughs and put a
smile<00:00:27.300> on<00:00:27.330> their<00:00:27.570> face<00:00:27.750> make<00:00:28.019> their<00:00:28.199> day

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
smile on their face make their day

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:29.839 
smile on their face make their day
brighter<00:00:28.590> and<00:00:28.830> I<00:00:28.920> think<00:00:29.279> that<00:00:29.460> that's<00:00:29.490> kind<00:00:29.820> of

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
brighter and I think that that's kind of

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.030 
brighter and I think that that's kind of
our<00:00:30.000> job<00:00:30.210> and<00:00:30.539> I<00:00:30.630> that's<00:00:31.349> what<00:00:31.679> makes<00:00:31.890> it

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
our job and I that's what makes it

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.560 
our job and I that's what makes it

worthwhile for both of us is really

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.630 
worthwhile for both of us is really
