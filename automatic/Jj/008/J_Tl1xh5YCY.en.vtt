00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
physique over the years especially today

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.590 
physique over the years especially today
I<00:01:44.470> guess<00:01:45.280> the<00:01:45.460> talk<00:01:45.670> of<00:01:45.700> the<00:01:45.880> town<00:01:45.910> was<00:01:46.360> those

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
I guess the talk of the town was those

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.020 
I guess the talk of the town was those
quads<00:01:46.990> good<00:01:47.740> lord<00:01:48.160> what<00:01:48.550> did<00:01:48.670> you<00:01:48.790> do<00:01:48.940> with

the streamline physique this was

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.870 
the streamline physique this was
probably<00:01:53.230> the<00:01:53.380> best<00:01:53.560> to<00:01:53.800> date<00:01:53.980> so<00:01:54.340> what<00:01:54.700> did
