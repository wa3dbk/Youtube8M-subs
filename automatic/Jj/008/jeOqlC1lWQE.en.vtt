 Of course you can take your opinion 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.490
 to write intro in the comments 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:40.469
 I am outraged and welcome 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:45.539

 So, if you have fifa, you have your 300 today 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.530

 thank you pete but please me

 Of course, I also want something else 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:15.360
 address here because that's exactly what is coming 

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:18.209
 but first the commentary tomorrow 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.580
 angel in the version 1.8 but on it me 

00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:26.549
 do not enter now 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:28.770
 In any case you have 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.679
 I already saw a new intro 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.470
 that it was made by the loving rector 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:36.330
 fx so definitely look 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.849
 definitely on his canal over 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.619
 that was really great for me that he was 

00:01:38.849 --> 00:01:43.739
 I made the intro I have stone 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.060
 black so it was right 

00:01:43.739 --> 00:01:48.479
 Of course, you can get really close 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.429
 your opinion on the intro in the comments 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.929
 writing the fifa already has that 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:57.869
 seen in front of you and I'm so cool 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:59.759
 definitely fabulous I'm on 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.050
 every case also pretty cool and 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.640
 in any case, thank you at this point 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.500
 also warmly at the Rector fix 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.099
 for the intro and definitely looks 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.929
 also normal 

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:08.340
 past his canal because he has 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:11.340
 there really like effort given 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.500
 is just such a 25 d intro is also times 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.040
 something different and such and take care 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:25.260
 I 'm waiting for sure yes I think so 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:27.629
 'm so and so little life I've nee 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.220
 okay and anyway 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:30.840
 he has a lot of trouble with it 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.350
 given and therefore looks like 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.880
 him over the intro 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.120
 I can be mine as in the video 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.100
 description linked and definitely 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.810
 Once again fat is thank you for that and 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.550
 You can do that again at this point 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.300
 in the comments we write that 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.740
 I think that's how I find intro 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.680
 As I said a little something 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:54.110
 other stop no dubstep intro or 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:03:00.800
 so just say something chillige 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:03:03.740
 I'm just really accurate 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.210
 I just wanted to say that the director has six 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.980
 the intro probably with one 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:08.870
 other front so uploaded with one 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.930
 other font and wants to 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.830
 bake out of here 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.380
 he probably has one 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.370
 other front uploaded and there you can 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.330
 In any case, you like again 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.730
 drop by 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.230
 So at his intro so at the 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.330
 I just say other introversion 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:26.870
 times with a different font 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:29.240
 because you definitely do not know 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.800
 I found do not say so sparkling 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.730
 I was that he was his comic style or 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:43.430
 do not be such a pacman style 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:44.780
 watch what I eat gaffes stop 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.280
 just a bit different font 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.010
 but of course you are welcome to do it again 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.810
 stop by and maybe yes 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.160
 you find the version also better 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.260
 and let him in any case, a 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.270
 Great that I would also mega mega 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:04:00.010
 and certainly you and it too 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:15.680
 died means it was a team or yes 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:17.750
 Well enough you said honestly today 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.770
 I have to say that it will not 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.510
 the longest round 

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:23.120
 because I just because she did not 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:25.010
 often enough time ok wat you go up 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.440
 to make another round writes to him 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:30.380
 then yes , even on him alone 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.870
 just the two that again afterwards pad of 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:35.270
 fucking theme makes only the power team 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.800
 deathmatch and so a happy child 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.940
 Pretty much complains about it 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.400
 just 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.550
 ok ok effect then we have there now 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.980
 also claps 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.330
 and i should say that for the beginning 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.560
 we can begin 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:51.770
 clearly we want a breastplate 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.770
 namely another we do once 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.210
 cling everything was sword yes 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:03.120
 Of course I hate extra for the 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.540
 golden apple or ok there I would 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.870
 say 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:09.120
 Butcher or let's go that way with us 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.560
 always wanted to either win fifa 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.390
 hearts with half a win 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.670
 half year of the people you become the same 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:16.550
 look great except I forgot correctly 

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:19.500
 hard hand or the people without shit 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:21.660
 sunday no matter in any case because we 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:32.190
 just the same pink exactly 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:33.600
 Okay, okay, okay 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:35.610
 people somehow i had at one go 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:40.190
 but the golden app how hard this is 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:40.190
 have come okay no such Koletzko 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:52.200
 three hearts but no idea dust me 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:54.750
 I once met in a better 

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:56.850
 but unbelieving people whenever fifa 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:59.220
 do not gamble so make battle hall 

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:01.560
 so far I swear it is because without 

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:09.420
 always it is always the same and sometimes 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:10.560
 Okay, but it's true and see here 

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:13.350
 For example we also have a new feature 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:16.290
 she is that people know 

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:20.250
 subtly upgrade to plaster from unico 

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:21.660
 that's coming to say exactly and yes 

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:23.550
 people i would say that was it now 

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:25.350
 but already from the round exists 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:26.610
 definitely the fifa over the 

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:29.790
 channel is found in the video 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:31.260
 description or write me on each 

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:33.180
 I would like to comment on her like you 

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.200
 The intro will find that will open me up 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:37.410
 interested in every case 

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:40.080
 and there i would say people a short 

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:43.440
 round but I can do it today 

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:45.390
 itself is time and I want to say 

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:48.410
 tomorrow and author a 

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:48.410
 what was there and looks
