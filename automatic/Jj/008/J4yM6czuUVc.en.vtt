on<00:00:46.559> this<00:00:46.770> elastic<00:00:47.340> cuffs<00:00:47.610> um<00:00:49.280> if<00:00:50.449> the<00:00:51.449> water<00:00:51.690> if

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
on this elastic cuffs um if the water if

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.689 
on this elastic cuffs um if the water if
since<00:00:52.469> I<00:00:52.559> was<00:00:52.680> holding<00:00:52.890> my<00:00:53.010> hand<00:00:53.039> out<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.550> hold

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
since I was holding my hand out the hold

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.630 
since I was holding my hand out the hold
the<00:00:53.820> camera<00:00:54.180> up<00:00:54.210> water<00:00:55.170> did<00:00:55.559> seep<00:00:55.860> down<00:00:56.070> in<00:00:56.399> but

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
the camera up water did seep down in but

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.010 
the camera up water did seep down in but
that's<00:00:56.820> only<00:00:56.940> because<00:00:57.120> my<00:00:57.300> hand<00:00:57.719> is<00:00:57.840> being

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
that's only because my hand is being

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.299 
that's only because my hand is being
held<00:00:58.289> up<00:00:58.500> um<00:00:58.739> I<00:00:59.670> guess<00:01:00.680> maybe<00:01:01.680> if<00:01:01.890> there's<00:01:02.100> some

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
held up um I guess maybe if there's some

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.740 
held up um I guess maybe if there's some
option<00:01:02.670> for<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.879> elastic<00:01:03.210> bands<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.539> make<00:01:03.600> a

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
option for the elastic bands to make a

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.140 
option for the elastic bands to make a
little<00:01:03.930> bit<00:01:04.110> tighter<00:01:04.830> but<00:01:05.189> then<00:01:05.790> for<00:01:06.030> most

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
little bit tighter but then for most

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.420 
little bit tighter but then for most
people<00:01:06.540> that<00:01:06.570> would<00:01:06.780> be<00:01:06.930> too<00:01:07.140> tight<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:08.189> see

barring<00:02:09.209> soo<00:02:09.450> is<00:02:09.660> worked<00:02:10.140> pretty<00:02:10.530> well

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.120 

so<00:02:17.150> recording<00:02:17.570> with<00:02:17.690> my<00:02:17.720> iPhone<00:02:18.320> I'm<00:02:18.770> trying

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
so recording with my iPhone I'm trying

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.580 
so recording with my iPhone I'm trying
to<00:02:19.220> do<00:02:19.340> a<00:02:19.450> video<00:02:20.450> quarter<00:02:20.900> or<00:02:21.020> something<00:02:21.200> and

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
to do a video quarter or something and

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.830 
to do a video quarter or something and
allows<00:02:21.800> you<00:02:21.950> to<00:02:22.040> switch<00:02:22.280> the<00:02:22.490> cameras<00:02:23.060> while

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
allows you to switch the cameras while

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.730 
allows you to switch the cameras while
recording<00:02:24.320> the<00:02:24.560> video<00:02:26.020> the<00:02:27.020> hood<00:02:27.260> I<00:02:27.470> think<00:02:27.680> I

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
recording the video the hood I think I

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:28.780 
recording the video the hood I think I
was<00:02:27.830> talking<00:02:28.010> about<00:02:28.040> the<00:02:28.220> hood<00:02:28.400> right<00:02:28.550> here<00:02:28.610> I

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
was talking about the hood right here I

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.750 
was talking about the hood right here I
think<00:02:28.880> for<00:02:29.360> it<00:02:30.080> is<00:02:30.260> a<00:02:30.290> small<00:02:30.740> and<00:02:31.040> I'm<00:02:31.130> small

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
think for it is a small and I'm small

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.890 
think for it is a small and I'm small
and<00:02:31.910> it's<00:02:32.030> pretty<00:02:32.150> baggy<00:02:32.450> on<00:02:32.630> me<00:02:32.870> but<00:02:33.500> dawn<00:02:33.830> I

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
and it's pretty baggy on me but dawn I

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.480 
and it's pretty baggy on me but dawn I
feel<00:02:35.900> like<00:02:36.050> the<00:02:36.590> hood<00:02:36.770> should<00:02:37.160> be<00:02:37.250> a<00:02:37.280> little

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
feel like the hood should be a little

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:38.980 
feel like the hood should be a little
bit<00:02:37.640> longer<00:02:37.880> I<00:02:38.060> see<00:02:38.360> no<00:02:38.420> reason<00:02:38.840> why<00:02:38.870> it

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
bit longer I see no reason why it

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.810 
bit longer I see no reason why it
shouldn't<00:02:39.260> be<00:02:39.470> my<00:02:39.620> head's<00:02:39.890> pretty<00:02:40.190> small<00:02:40.520> so

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
shouldn't be my head's pretty small so

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.120 
shouldn't be my head's pretty small so
somebody<00:02:41.630> has<00:02:41.720> a<00:02:41.750> bigger<00:02:41.990> head<00:02:42.260> to<00:02:42.380> me<00:02:42.560> then

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
somebody has a bigger head to me then

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.270 
somebody has a bigger head to me then
that's<00:02:43.730> gonna<00:02:44.120> be<00:02:44.300> even<00:02:44.360> worse<00:02:44.450> the<00:02:45.440> the

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
that's gonna be even worse the the

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.310 
that's gonna be even worse the the
little<00:02:46.700> straps<00:02:47.270> around<00:02:47.510> the<00:02:47.720> neck<00:02:47.960> work

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
little straps around the neck work

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.120 
little straps around the neck work
pretty<00:02:48.590> well<00:02:48.710> um<00:02:49.960> they<00:02:50.960> sent<00:02:51.500> you<00:02:51.620> down<00:02:51.770> good

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
pretty well um they sent you down good

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.600 
pretty well um they sent you down good
but<00:02:52.880> like<00:02:53.180> I<00:02:53.270> said<00:02:53.330> the<00:02:53.720> hood<00:02:53.960> was<00:02:54.190> like<00:02:55.190> my<00:02:55.340> go

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
but like I said the hood was like my go

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:11.670 
but like I said the hood was like my go
I<00:02:55.640> was<00:02:56.240> kind<00:02:56.510> of<00:02:56.540> small<00:02:56.840> so<00:02:57.550> yes<00:02:58.550> I<00:02:58.700> felt<00:02:59.090> it<00:02:59.240> was

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.090 

yeah<00:03:12.680> um<00:03:13.660> actually<00:03:14.660> add<00:03:14.990> that<00:03:15.200> there<00:03:15.530> Takako

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100

stock<00:03:16.310> came<00:03:16.520> out<00:03:16.670> my<00:03:16.880> feet<00:03:17.120> are<00:03:17.240> completely

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
stock came out my feet are completely

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.740 
stock came out my feet are completely
wet<00:03:17.840> but<00:03:18.530> that's<00:03:19.160> not<00:03:19.420> problem<00:03:20.420> because<00:03:20.660> the

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
wet but that's not problem because the

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.830 
wet but that's not problem because the
rest<00:03:20.780> of<00:03:21.110> me<00:03:21.200> was<00:03:21.230> completely<00:03:21.920> dry<00:03:22.190> um

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
rest of me was completely dry um

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.500 
rest of me was completely dry um
pensive<00:03:24.620> but<00:03:24.830> nice<00:03:25.400> too<00:03:25.670> rational<00:03:25.850> about<00:03:26.300> a

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
pensive but nice too rational about a

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.810 
pensive but nice too rational about a
little<00:03:26.690> bit<00:03:26.780> too<00:03:26.930> long<00:03:27.280> tiniest<00:03:28.280> bit<00:03:28.520> like<00:03:28.730> an

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
little bit too long tiniest bit like an

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.620 
little bit too long tiniest bit like an
inch<00:03:28.970> too<00:03:29.420> too<00:03:29.690> long<00:03:29.900> but<00:03:30.670> that<00:03:31.670> probably

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
inch too too long but that probably

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.410 
inch too too long but that probably
shouldn't<00:03:32.990> matter<00:03:33.680> too<00:03:34.040> much<00:03:34.240> it's<00:03:35.240> been<00:03:35.360> a

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
shouldn't matter too much it's been a

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.300 
shouldn't matter too much it's been a
little<00:03:35.840> bit<00:03:35.990> long<00:03:36.200> gets<00:03:36.560> a<00:03:36.650> little<00:03:36.890> bit<00:03:37.040> short

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310

rain jacket sir who rule that's probably
why

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:10.760 

otherwise<00:05:06.290> these<00:05:07.290> are<00:05:07.700> they<00:05:08.700> work<00:05:08.880> well<00:05:09.770> then

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
otherwise these are they work well then

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.140 
otherwise these are they work well then
got<00:05:10.950> hot<00:05:11.070> of<00:05:11.250> course<00:05:11.430> it's<00:05:11.580> probably<00:05:11.670> like<00:05:11.910> 60

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
got hot of course it's probably like 60

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.840 
got hot of course it's probably like 60
65<00:05:12.960> 70<00:05:13.020> outside<00:05:13.770> now<00:05:13.950> because<00:05:14.220> it<00:05:14.340> just<00:05:14.460> poured

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850 
65 70 outside now because it just poured

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:19.550 
65 70 outside now because it just poured
like<00:05:15.570> an<00:05:15.720> hour<00:05:15.810> straight<00:05:16.110> but<00:05:18.020> inside<00:05:19.020> dry<00:05:19.380> off

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
like an hour straight but inside dry off

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:25.010 
like an hour straight but inside dry off
oh<00:05:23.150> yeah<00:05:24.150> thanks

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020

oh yeah thanks
I<00:05:25.050> don't<00:05:25.590> know<00:05:25.770> durable<00:05:26.250> to<00:05:26.490> test<00:05:26.700> the

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:26.850 
I don't know durable to test the

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.760 
I don't know durable to test the
waterproof<00:05:27.330> test<00:05:27.360> if<00:05:28.110> we<00:05:28.170> can<00:05:28.350> handle<00:05:28.470> that

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
waterproof test if we can handle that

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.940 
waterproof test if we can handle that
rain<00:05:29.010> and<00:05:29.310> after<00:05:29.610> 15<00:05:30.240> 20<00:05:30.510> minutes<00:05:30.780> I<00:05:30.930> look<00:05:31.770> like

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:31.950 
rain and after 15 20 minutes I look like

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:33.980 
rain and after 15 20 minutes I look like
it's<00:05:32.100> starting<00:05:32.250> to<00:05:32.400> soak<00:05:32.640> in<00:05:32.820> and<00:05:33.750> that's

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 
it's starting to soak in and that's

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.890 
it's starting to soak in and that's
pretty<00:05:34.230> good<00:05:34.350> for<00:05:34.770> a<00:05:35.040> water<00:05:35.340> proof<00:05:36.150> miss<00:05:36.540> I'd

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 
pretty good for a water proof miss I'd

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.040 
pretty good for a water proof miss I'd
say<00:05:37.680> any<00:05:38.400> object<00:05:38.970> is<00:05:39.060> going<00:05:39.180> to<00:05:39.270> fail<00:05:39.480> after<00:05:39.840> so

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 
say any object is going to fail after so

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:43.760 
say any object is going to fail after so
to<00:05:40.920> bust<00:05:41.160> hours<00:05:41.520> in<00:05:41.670> that<00:05:41.790> pouring<00:05:42.560> so<00:05:43.560> don't

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 
to bust hours in that pouring so don't

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.950 
to bust hours in that pouring so don't
expect<00:05:44.190> it<00:05:44.400> to<00:05:44.430> last<00:05:44.760> probably<00:05:45.030> like<00:05:45.360> for<00:05:45.600> more

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 
expect it to last probably like for more

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.750 
expect it to last probably like for more
than<00:05:46.080> four<00:05:46.260> hours<00:05:46.290> probably<00:05:46.830> before<00:05:47.370> you<00:05:47.640> get

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:47.760 
than four hours probably before you get

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.040 
than four hours probably before you get
wet<00:05:47.970> and<00:05:48.180> you're<00:05:48.450> getting<00:05:48.570> away<00:05:48.720> no<00:05:48.960> matter

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.050 
wet and you're getting away no matter

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:51.650 
wet and you're getting away no matter
what<00:05:49.350> if<00:05:49.800> it's<00:05:49.950> ringing<00:05:50.130> like<00:05:50.370> that<00:05:50.610> for<00:05:51.390> four

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:51.660 
what if it's ringing like that for four

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:55.400 
what if it's ringing like that for four
hours<00:05:51.960> but<00:05:52.640> have<00:05:53.640> you<00:05:53.700> any<00:05:53.790> question<00:05:54.410> well

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:55.410 
hours but have you any question well

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:59.030 
hours but have you any question well
actually<00:05:55.620> I<00:05:56.070> just<00:05:56.130> took<00:05:56.790> it<00:05:56.940> off<00:05:57.090> and<00:05:57.440> I<00:05:58.440> hadn't

00:05:59.030 --> 00:05:59.040 
actually I just took it off and I hadn't

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.160 
actually I just took it off and I hadn't
realized<00:05:59.580> until<00:05:59.730> I<00:05:59.850> took<00:06:00.030> it<00:06:00.150> off<00:06:00.270> the<00:06:00.780> back<00:06:01.020> of

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:01.170 
realized until I took it off the back of

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:08.230 
realized until I took it off the back of
my<00:06:01.290> shirt<00:06:01.530> here<00:06:03.320> is<00:06:04.320> wet

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:08.240 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.180 

you<00:06:08.840> can<00:06:08.990> see<00:06:09.169> you<00:06:09.289> and<00:06:09.470> I'll<00:06:09.530> turn<00:06:09.830> the<00:06:09.949> video

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:10.190 
you can see you and I'll turn the video

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:15.370 
you can see you and I'll turn the video
around<00:06:11.680> look<00:06:12.680> right<00:06:12.949> here<00:06:13.190> the<00:06:14.000> tag<00:06:14.300> is<00:06:15.110> so

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:15.380 
around look right here the tag is so

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:19.270 
around look right here the tag is so
crew<00:06:15.910> in<00:06:16.910> this<00:06:17.090> area<00:06:17.479> um<00:06:18.080> I<00:06:18.620> think<00:06:18.949> that's

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:19.280 
crew in this area um I think that's

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:23.140 
crew in this area um I think that's
because<00:06:19.610> some<00:06:19.759> of<00:06:19.849> the<00:06:19.910> water<00:06:21.310> got<00:06:22.310> soaked<00:06:22.880> I

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:23.150 
because some of the water got soaked I

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.570 
because some of the water got soaked I
just<00:06:23.630> sat<00:06:23.870> there<00:06:23.900> I<00:06:24.380> think<00:06:25.160> that's<00:06:25.370> the<00:06:25.460> reason

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:25.580 
just sat there I think that's the reason

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.900 
just sat there I think that's the reason
that's<00:06:25.759> the<00:06:25.910> only<00:06:26.120> spot<00:06:26.210> that<00:06:26.449> got<00:06:26.539> wet<00:06:27.910> it

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:28.910 
that's the only spot that got wet it

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:33.969 
that's the only spot that got wet it
seems<00:06:29.270> like<00:06:29.419> that<00:06:29.599> soaked<00:06:29.810> through<00:06:30.050> I<00:06:32.979> think

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:33.979 
seems like that soaked through I think

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:36.279 
seems like that soaked through I think
yeah<00:06:34.849> I<00:06:34.880> think<00:06:34.970> the<00:06:35.210> only<00:06:35.360> reason<00:06:35.569> that<00:06:35.750> got

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:36.289 
yeah I think the only reason that got

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:39.550 
yeah I think the only reason that got
wet<00:06:36.500> there's<00:06:36.830> because<00:06:37.479> one<00:06:38.479> this<00:06:39.169> is<00:06:39.349> steam

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:39.560 
wet there's because one this is steam

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:46.540 
wet there's because one this is steam
right<00:06:39.800> there<00:06:40.069> I'll<00:06:40.550> show<00:06:41.000> you<00:06:45.099> okay<00:06:46.099> here<00:06:46.460> we

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:46.550 
right there I'll show you okay here we

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:46.689 
right there I'll show you okay here we
go

00:06:46.689 --> 00:06:46.699 
go

00:06:46.699 --> 00:06:48.760 
go
all<00:06:47.360> right<00:06:47.449> here's<00:06:47.659> the<00:06:47.750> steam<00:06:48.080> and<00:06:48.620> it's

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:48.770 
all right here's the steam and it's

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:50.680 
all right here's the steam and it's
probably<00:06:49.069> like<00:06:49.340> bunched<00:06:49.970> up<00:06:50.060> into<00:06:50.479> water

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:50.690 
probably like bunched up into water

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:52.659 
probably like bunched up into water
should<00:06:50.990> sitting<00:06:51.349> right<00:06:51.500> there<00:06:51.740> so<00:06:51.949> if<00:06:52.550> you<00:06:52.639> I

00:06:52.659 --> 00:06:52.669 
should sitting right there so if you I

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:54.430 
should sitting right there so if you I
guess<00:06:52.880> if<00:06:53.030> you<00:06:53.150> like<00:06:53.360> Steam<00:06:53.810> sale<00:06:54.050> it<00:06:54.289> or

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:54.440 
guess if you like Steam sale it or

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.159 
guess if you like Steam sale it or
something<00:06:54.830> put<00:06:55.039> some<00:06:55.190> kind<00:06:55.310> of<00:06:56.169> something

00:06:57.159 --> 00:06:57.169 
something put some kind of something

00:06:57.169 --> 00:06:58.930 
something put some kind of something
right<00:06:57.319> here<00:06:57.500> that<00:06:57.740> I<00:06:57.770> don't<00:06:58.009> know<00:06:58.190> what<00:06:58.430> so

00:06:58.930 --> 00:06:58.940 
right here that I don't know what so

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.120 
right here that I don't know what so
consume<00:06:59.360> solar<00:06:59.659> or<00:06:59.810> something<00:07:00.229> that<00:07:00.860> can<00:07:00.949> just

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:01.130 
consume solar or something that can just

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:02.559 
consume solar or something that can just
kind<00:07:01.280> of<00:07:01.340> get<00:07:01.580> in<00:07:01.699> there<00:07:01.909> and<00:07:02.090> fill<00:07:02.360> up<00:07:02.449> the

00:07:02.559 --> 00:07:02.569 
kind of get in there and fill up the

00:07:02.569 --> 00:07:04.870 
kind of get in there and fill up the
cracks<00:07:02.810> it<00:07:03.259> probably<00:07:03.949> helped<00:07:04.340> a<00:07:04.430> lot<00:07:04.580> I<00:07:04.639> think

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:04.880 
cracks it probably helped a lot I think

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.629 
cracks it probably helped a lot I think
that's<00:07:05.060> where<00:07:05.210> the<00:07:05.300> water<00:07:05.509> got<00:07:05.750> grew

00:07:06.629 --> 00:07:06.639 
that's where the water got grew

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:10.149 
that's where the water got grew
otherwise<00:07:07.639> if<00:07:08.449> if<00:07:09.139> the<00:07:09.289> water<00:07:09.440> doesn't<00:07:09.710> sit<00:07:10.009> on

00:07:10.149 --> 00:07:10.159 
otherwise if if the water doesn't sit on

00:07:10.159 --> 00:07:12.670 
otherwise if if the water doesn't sit on
it<00:07:10.340> and<00:07:10.490> like<00:07:11.120> I<00:07:11.210> said<00:07:11.270> it<00:07:11.990> seems<00:07:12.229> to<00:07:12.320> be<00:07:12.440> pretty

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:12.680 
it and like I said it seems to be pretty

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:18.129 
it and like I said it seems to be pretty
good<00:07:12.860> and<00:07:15.669> yeah<00:07:16.669> like<00:07:17.360> you<00:07:17.509> say<00:07:17.690> have<00:07:18.020> any

00:07:18.129 --> 00:07:18.139 
good and yeah like you say have any
