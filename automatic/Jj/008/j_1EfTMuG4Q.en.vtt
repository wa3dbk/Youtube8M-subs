 wonderful word and you are all used to 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.090
 see her like that 

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:20.310
 connected to your TV lying 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.060
 beckoning rather throw those vital 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.430
 affairs 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.740
 plunge into this world of chic games 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.400
 whose prefix was not deprived 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.710
 yes then there was no concept of new games like 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.699
 now few have seen mega drive 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.350
 so here is the original 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:39.570
 model 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:42.420
 Asian American almost looked like 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.030
 same but was called jervis had a couple 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.070
 insignificant differences why was 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.760
 change so nice name mega 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.100
 drive 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.769
 And all because of the famous American courts 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.019
 meet in which sega did not want so 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:57.420
 as the name and frames of the usa had what 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:01:00.629
 something small not at all in the world 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.299
 video game company it was there with us 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.339
 in Russia, the end of what let her in Chinese 

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:07.560
 illegal option with a proud name 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.450
 sega mega drive 2 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.040
 I'm more than sure then you are not 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.590
 wondered how to do exactly 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.810
 the first thing is to release different 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.630
 revise one console is not an idea 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.430
 just playstation engineers up 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.159
 this saddle managed to carry out such 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.990
 increasing demand with your master console 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.180
 system and the success of such 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.890
 marketing move and played on that 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.090
 always decided to release an updated 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.880
 rubber to drive 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.979
 The first version of the console is considered much 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.929
 better deed has a separate outlet for 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:41.820
 lose sound volume control 

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:43.080
 Yes, and the appearance is more pleasing to the eye 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.900
 associate with me 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.690
 and so the world of consoles even 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.000
 logo was appropriate than 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.880
 noteworthy ignazi hellish version she 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.440
 has no regional differences in 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.450
 difference from its American and 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.840
 European fellow that you allow 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.610
 run games of absolutely any region 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.230
 Of course, the operator is also read without any 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.030
 of problems 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:07.920
 on the front we have two 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.560
 port for connecting controllers 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.330
 fit as 3 push buttons so 6 push buttons 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.380
 controllers and dates of Chinese 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.050
 production 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:19.560
 there is also a connector for output 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:22.740
 stereo sound by ordinary people on the back 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.660
 panel we have a connector for output 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:28.320
 video signal and connector for 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:31.200
 power supply unit has gone with 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.300
 conveyor in October 88 and immediately 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.270
 decided to build global plans for 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.310
 the world is not the first to capture the world 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.440
 just withstand such a huge flow 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.180
 pretty high-quality games that for those 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.060
 at times they were simply amazed by the quality 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.790
 graphics and sound then the console enslaved 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.220
 USA and Europe if you like that big 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.080
 some games were arcade ports 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.239
 gaming machines popular secret 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.760
 abroad has increased at an incredible pace 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.650
 quickly left behind all competitors 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.160
 there was nothing left to do 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.470
 release your songs with the most 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.989
 starting a fourth-generation console war 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.820
 you were initially weaker than hanging around 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.010
 Nintendo's rivals especially this 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.689
 concerned executioners for which 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.599
 produce only high-quality sound 

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:17.640
 synthesized speech and the powerful men of his x 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:20.400
 Like salt this is a huge advertising 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.799
 the campaign did their job the Americans up 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.260
 still remember that mysterious trump 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:27.629
 the eye of the process which was the most significant 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.769
 argument disputes all owners 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:31.829
 consoles from sega 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.909
 there will still be such an advertisement could make 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:38.760
 ponder any potential 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:43.069
 genesis coupe buyer 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.069
 lingam knit here is a layer 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.549
 for the sake of 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.890
 Arbidol saved an alphabet 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.810
 dear 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.910
 but what exactly was asked well let's 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:15.090
 ask the director should america about 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:17.880
 no good afternoon mr collins left 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:20.400
 ki what is eye processing it 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.530
 some special technology by processors 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.280
 special chip which is responsible for 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.280
 graphics processing 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.490
 why don't you answer everything here 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.889
 understandable because it was with the processing 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.389
 further publicity stunt 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:40.580
 fiction like government in 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:44.060
 somali is like she really is him 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:46.220
 no ninety-third year was finally 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:49.069

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:51.650
 who knows everything she was 

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:54.379
 wanted less functional but 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:56.330
 decreased in size with time in 

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:58.430
 the first half of the 90s to perform 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.009
 popularity without a well-selling 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.849
 console sega has released an extension not 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:04.009
 extinguish 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:06.590
 which really did not meet expectations 

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:09.020
 brought some innovation then was 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:11.060
 32x is released expansion 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:13.400

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.360
 a lot of it went to the platform too 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.340
 cool games 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.500
 it is worth taking the special version 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:23.389
 doom games which in those years was not 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:25.550
 moment popular among gamers 1996 

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:27.409
 year sega turned production for mega 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.259
 drive and in order to free the conveyor 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:32.270
 ribbons for your next generation console 

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:34.490
 saturn thereby and ending the era 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:36.650
 genesis mega drive for long end 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:39.139
 fourth generation consoles from sega 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:41.659
 true third world countries console 

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:43.430
 Long remained popular in Russia 

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:44.719
 in fiery footage won up to 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:46.460
 beginnings of two thousandth

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:51.180
 variations of cheap chinese villages and even in 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:53.199
 portable version 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.300
 it's safe to say that 

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:57.250
 fourth generation of consoles 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.680
 it was as breakthrough as 5 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:02.110
 but still this is the final milestone 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.479
 two-dimensional 16-bit platformers and 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:06.099
 transition to what a cold and perfect 

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:08.979
