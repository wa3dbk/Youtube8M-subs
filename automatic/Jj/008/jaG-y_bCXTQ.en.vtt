too<00:05:41.400> long<00:05:41.580> for<00:05:41.880> you<00:05:41.940> to<00:05:42.000> do<00:05:42.210> it<00:05:42.330> all<00:05:42.450> in<00:05:42.600> one

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:42.630 
too long for you to do it all in one

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.390 
too long for you to do it all in one
piece<00:05:42.990> at<00:05:43.140> ways<00:05:43.260> with<00:05:43.410> my<00:05:43.560> iron<00:05:43.800> I<00:05:44.040> find<00:05:44.280> it

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 
piece at ways with my iron I find it

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.370 
piece at ways with my iron I find it
easier<00:05:44.490> to<00:05:44.760> just<00:05:45.060> do<00:05:45.210> it<00:05:45.360> section<00:05:46.200> by<00:05:46.260> section

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:46.380 
easier to just do it section by section

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:52.070 
easier to just do it section by section
so<00:05:46.970> what<00:05:47.970> you<00:05:48.150> do<00:05:48.390> is<00:05:50.060> you<00:05:51.060> take<00:05:51.090> your<00:05:51.450> curling

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.080

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.860 
without letting it go loose okay so i

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:07.040 
without letting it go loose okay so i
think<00:06:04.980> it's<00:06:05.250> been<00:06:05.490> hella<00:06:05.700> long<00:06:05.910> enough<00:06:06.240> go
