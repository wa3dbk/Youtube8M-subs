this<00:00:04.920> is<00:00:05.100> the<00:00:05.279> cure<00:00:05.580> Tron<00:00:06.559> XP<00:00:07.559> system<00:00:07.859> that

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
this is the cure Tron XP system that

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.700 
this is the cure Tron XP system that
I've<00:00:08.400> got<00:00:08.610> displayed<00:00:09.000> for<00:00:09.210> you<00:00:09.360> here<00:00:09.720> so<00:00:10.559> let

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
I've got displayed for you here so let

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.050 
I've got displayed for you here so let
me<00:00:10.740> just<00:00:10.830> demonstrate<00:00:11.070> how<00:00:11.490> we<00:00:11.550> start<00:00:11.940> this

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:12.060 
me just demonstrate how we start this

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:13.190 
me just demonstrate how we start this
and<00:00:12.180> I'll<00:00:12.300> show<00:00:12.420> you<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.690> extent<00:00:13.020> of<00:00:13.080> the

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
and I'll show you the extent of the

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.440 
and I'll show you the extent of the
field<00:00:13.410> so<00:00:14.340> you<00:00:14.400> turn<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:14.730> unit<00:00:15.030> on<00:00:15.150> there's<00:00:15.390> a

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
field so you turn the unit on there's a

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.300 
field so you turn the unit on there's a
switch<00:00:15.660> on<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:15.810> back<00:00:16.019> you<00:00:16.170> power<00:00:16.379> it<00:00:16.500> on<00:00:16.650> and

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
switch on the back you power it on and

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.790 
switch on the back you power it on and
then<00:00:17.880> there<00:00:18.480> are<00:00:18.510> four<00:00:18.779> buttons<00:00:18.960> here<00:00:19.320> this<00:00:19.650> is

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
then there are four buttons here this is

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.279 
then there are four buttons here this is

operation<00:00:24.710> this<00:00:25.710> is<00:00:25.830> your<00:00:26.210> light<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:27.449> indicate

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
operation this is your light to indicate

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.470 
operation this is your light to indicate
which<00:00:28.230> program<00:00:28.980> you've<00:00:29.190> selected<00:00:29.430> and<00:00:30.060> this

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
which program you've selected and this

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.330 
which program you've selected and this
is<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.750> timer

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 
is the timer

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.790 
is the timer
the<00:00:32.340> system<00:00:33.329> will<00:00:33.449> shut<00:00:33.600> itself<00:00:33.780> off<00:00:34.140> when<00:00:34.710> the

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
the system will shut itself off when the

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.219 
the system will shut itself off when the
timer<00:00:35.070> is<00:00:35.219> completed<00:00:35.729> it<00:00:36.149> runs<00:00:36.359> 15<00:00:36.749> minutes<00:00:37.079> on

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:37.229 
timer is completed it runs 15 minutes on

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:39.979 
timer is completed it runs 15 minutes on
program<00:00:37.800> 0<00:00:38.249> through<00:00:38.489> 4<00:00:38.760> so<00:00:39.239> there<00:00:39.449> are<00:00:39.600> 10

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
program 0 through 4 so there are 10

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.649 
program 0 through 4 so there are 10
programs<00:00:40.469> in<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.739> system<00:00:41.100> 0<00:00:41.699> through<00:00:41.940> 4<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.420> 5

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:42.659 
programs in the system 0 through 4 and 5

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:47.119 
programs in the system 0 through 4 and 5
through<00:00:42.989> 9<00:00:43.019> and<00:00:44.359> the<00:00:45.359> 0<00:00:45.749> through<00:00:45.989> 4<00:00:46.229> is<00:00:46.559> about

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
through 9 and the 0 through 4 is about

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.479 
through 9 and the 0 through 4 is about
20%<00:00:48.030> of<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.420> intensity<00:00:49.049> of<00:00:49.229> the<00:00:49.920> 5<00:00:50.159> through<00:00:50.460> 9

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
20% of the intensity of the 5 through 9

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.219 
20% of the intensity of the 5 through 9
so<00:00:50.969> 5<00:00:51.179> through<00:00:51.389> 9<00:00:51.449> are<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.809> highest

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:52.229 
so 5 through 9 are the highest

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:54.439 
so 5 through 9 are the highest
intensities<00:00:52.829> on<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.460> system<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.059> that's

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
intensities on the system and that's

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.680 
intensities on the system and that's
where<00:00:54.659> you<00:00:54.749> reach<00:00:54.959> your<00:00:54.989> peak<00:00:55.350> potentials<00:00:56.309> so

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
where you reach your peak potentials so

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.020 
where you reach your peak potentials so
you<00:00:57.690> pick<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:57.929> program<00:00:58.379> so<00:00:58.739> let's<00:00:58.769> pick<00:00:59.670> one<00:00:59.850> so

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
you pick a program so let's pick one so

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.669 
you pick a program so let's pick one so
there's<00:01:00.209> one<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.899> you<00:01:01.079> just<00:01:01.229> keep<00:01:01.379> pressing

00:01:01.669 --> 00:01:01.679 
there's one and you just keep pressing

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:03.319 
there's one and you just keep pressing
the<00:01:01.920> button<00:01:02.069> until<00:01:02.429> you<00:01:02.609> did<00:01:02.969> pick<00:01:03.299> the

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
the button until you did pick the

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.810 
the button until you did pick the
program<00:01:03.719> that<00:01:03.869> you<00:01:03.929> want<00:01:04.129> say<00:01:05.129> all<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.729> way

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
program that you want say all the way

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.250 
program that you want say all the way
through<00:01:06.060> cycle<00:01:06.450> 9<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:06.720> then<00:01:06.810> it<00:01:06.990> just<00:01:07.110> goes

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
through cycle 9 and then it just goes

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.460 
through cycle 9 and then it just goes
back<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.710> zero<00:01:08.280> again<00:01:08.450> so<00:01:09.450> let's<00:01:09.660> do<00:01:09.870> let's<00:01:10.320> do

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
back to zero again so let's do let's do

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.310 
back to zero again so let's do let's do
zero<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.340> then<00:01:11.970> we'll<00:01:12.120> press<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.420> right

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
zero and then we'll press the right

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.310 
zero and then we'll press the right
arrow<00:01:13.350> key<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:14.250> start<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:15.020> then<00:01:16.020> you'll<00:01:16.140> see

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
arrow key to start and then you'll see

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.500 
arrow key to start and then you'll see
the<00:01:16.500> timer<00:01:16.770> begin<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.670> run<00:01:17.850> down<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.360> you'll

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:18.510 
the timer begin to run down and you'll

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:20.690 
the timer begin to run down and you'll
see<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.960> lights<00:01:19.410> a<00:01:19.680> circling<00:01:20.190> indicating

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
see the lights a circling indicating

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.870 
see the lights a circling indicating
that<00:01:20.730> it's<00:01:20.940> working<00:01:21.150> so<00:01:21.870> this<00:01:22.080> system<00:01:22.290> is<00:01:22.530> now

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
that it's working so this system is now

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.190 
that it's working so this system is now
connected<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:24.000> this<00:01:24.120> pillow<00:01:24.420> applicator<00:01:24.990> and

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
connected to this pillow applicator and

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.140 
connected to this pillow applicator and
it's<00:01:25.680> actually<00:01:26.040> running<00:01:26.220> there's<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.730> port<00:01:27.000> in

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
it's actually running there's a port in

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.060 
it's actually running there's a port in
the<00:01:27.240> back<00:01:27.420> for<00:01:28.140> each<00:01:28.290> applicator<00:01:28.800> you<00:01:28.860> can

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
the back for each applicator you can

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.910 
the back for each applicator you can
only<00:01:29.190> put<00:01:29.400> one<00:01:29.610> applicator<00:01:30.240> at<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.450> time<00:01:30.920> so

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
only put one applicator at a time so

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
only put one applicator at a time so
this<00:01:32.040> is<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.220> magnetic<00:01:32.880> field<00:01:33.120> detector<00:01:33.740> and

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
this is a magnetic field detector and

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.840 
this is a magnetic field detector and
you<00:01:35.940> can<00:01:36.090> hear<00:01:36.300> the<00:01:36.420> field<00:01:36.660> pulsing<00:01:37.700> right<00:01:38.700> now

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
you can hear the field pulsing right now

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.430 
you can hear the field pulsing right now
as<00:01:38.970> I<00:01:39.090> move<00:01:39.300> it<00:01:39.420> away<00:01:39.510> from<00:01:39.840> this<00:01:40.020> from<00:01:40.350> the

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
as I move it away from this from the

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.890 
as I move it away from this from the
surface<00:01:40.860> of<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.070> control<00:01:41.670> unit<00:01:42.000> or<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.630> pad

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 
surface of the control unit or the pad

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.510 
surface of the control unit or the pad
the<00:01:43.890> magnetic<00:01:44.310> field

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
the magnetic field

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
the magnetic field
drops<00:01:46.180> off<00:01:46.420> so<00:01:47.049> let<00:01:47.229> me<00:01:47.320> do<00:01:47.470> this<00:01:47.619> to<00:01:47.950> the<00:01:48.070> sides

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
drops off so let me do this to the sides

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.760 
drops off so let me do this to the sides
so<00:01:49.540> right<00:01:49.810> next<00:01:49.990> to<00:01:50.170> it<00:01:50.290> it's<00:01:50.380> the<00:01:50.470> highest

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
so right next to it it's the highest

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:56.190 
so right next to it it's the highest
intensity<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:52.590> as<00:01:53.590> you<00:01:53.740> move<00:01:53.860> away<00:01:55.200> the

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
intensity and as you move away the

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
intensity and as you move away the
magnetic<00:01:56.590> field<00:01:56.740> drops<00:01:56.979> off<00:01:57.190> significantly

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
magnetic field drops off significantly

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.399 
magnetic field drops off significantly
now<00:01:58.150> I<00:01:58.180> can<00:01:58.479> still<00:01:58.659> hear<00:01:58.900> significant

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
now I can still hear significant

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:01.590 
now I can still hear significant
magnetic<00:01:59.650> field<00:01:59.950> out<00:02:00.130> here<00:02:00.180> which<00:02:01.180> is<00:02:01.360> really

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
magnetic field out here which is really

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.270 
magnetic field out here which is really
important<00:02:02.140> because<00:02:02.380> what<00:02:02.680> happens<00:02:03.100> is<00:02:03.250> that

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
important because what happens is that

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.580 
important because what happens is that
the<00:02:04.180> magnetic<00:02:04.479> field<00:02:04.630> next<00:02:04.990> to<00:02:05.110> the<00:02:05.229> body<00:02:05.440> is

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
the magnetic field next to the body is

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:06.899 
the magnetic field next to the body is
going<00:02:05.680> to<00:02:05.800> be<00:02:05.890> the<00:02:06.009> strongest<00:02:06.280> but<00:02:06.670> on<00:02:06.820> the

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
going to be the strongest but on the

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:08.639 
going to be the strongest but on the
other<00:02:07.119> side<00:02:07.360> of<00:02:07.600> the<00:02:07.780> body<00:02:07.960> say<00:02:08.289> you're<00:02:08.440> laying

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
other side of the body say you're laying

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.440 
other side of the body say you're laying
on<00:02:08.800> your<00:02:08.860> back<00:02:09.130> then<00:02:09.789> the<00:02:09.910> other<00:02:10.030> side<00:02:10.270> of<00:02:10.390> the
