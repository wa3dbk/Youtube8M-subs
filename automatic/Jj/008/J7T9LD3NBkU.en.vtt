00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.970 
you see magic in it and try to make 10
or<00:02:30.530> 15<00:02:31.040> more<00:02:31.280> tweak<00:02:31.670> it<00:02:31.790> a<00:02:31.850> little<00:02:31.880> bit<00:02:32.240> and<00:02:32.980> and

a no-brainer but we're going to go ahead

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:55.820 
a no-brainer but we're going to go ahead

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
and install this and we're going to make

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.950 
and install this and we're going to make
a<00:03:55.890> nitrous<00:03:56.370> pull<00:03:56.640> see<00:03:57.240> what<00:03:57.390> kind<00:03:57.540> of<00:03:57.570> power<00:03:57.780> we

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:57.960 
a nitrous pull see what kind of power we

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:08.539 
a nitrous pull see what kind of power we

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
little we wind up making 690 so it

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.830 
little we wind up making 690 so it
always<00:04:15.340> gets<00:04:15.670> better<00:04:15.879> we<00:04:16.239> forward<00:04:16.660> it<00:04:16.780> a

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
always gets better we forward it a

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.330 
always gets better we forward it a
little<00:04:17.019> bit<00:04:17.229> wait<00:04:17.440> a<00:04:17.620> minute<00:04:17.949> wait<00:04:18.160> a<00:04:18.280> minute
