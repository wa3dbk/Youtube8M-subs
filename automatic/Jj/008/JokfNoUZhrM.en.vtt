about 2,000 percent in women it's about

for<00:02:33.120> energy<00:02:33.180> I<00:02:33.690> mean<00:02:33.959> we<00:02:34.140> have<00:02:34.230> to<00:02:34.320> think<00:02:34.560> about

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
for energy I mean we have to think about

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:36.410 
for energy I mean we have to think about
this<00:02:34.890> for<00:02:35.040> a<00:02:35.130> second<00:02:35.489> we're<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:35.880> same<00:02:36.090> genetic

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
this for a second we're the same genetic

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.420 
this for a second we're the same genetic
code<00:02:36.570> as<00:02:36.660> our<00:02:36.750> hunter-gatherer<00:02:36.989> ancestors<00:02:37.530> we

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
code as our hunter-gatherer ancestors we

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.430 
code as our hunter-gatherer ancestors we
thrived<00:02:38.970> off<00:02:39.269> very<00:02:39.660> little<00:02:39.870> food<00:02:40.019> and<00:02:40.140> morning

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
thrived off very little food and morning

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.900 
thrived off very little food and morning
we<00:02:40.530> have<00:02:40.620> to<00:02:40.650> go<00:02:40.830> hunt<00:02:41.100> and<00:02:41.310> forage<00:02:41.459> and<00:02:41.700> fees

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
we have to go hunt and forage and fees

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.259 
we have to go hunt and forage and fees
and<00:02:42.180> so<00:02:42.570> our<00:02:42.810> body's<00:02:43.310> designed<00:02:44.310> to<00:02:44.730> be<00:02:44.850> very

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
and so our body's designed to be very

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.479 
and so our body's designed to be very
efficient<00:02:45.870> on<00:02:46.049> in<00:02:46.530> a<00:02:46.650> fasted<00:02:47.040> state<00:02:47.100> it

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
you feel sluggish and tired so what kind
