in<00:02:05.590> a<00:02:05.649> slightly<00:02:05.889> dark<00:02:06.189> room<00:02:06.429> but<00:02:06.639> you<00:02:06.700> can<00:02:06.880> tell

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
in a slightly dark room but you can tell

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.300 
in a slightly dark room but you can tell
it's<00:02:07.389> not<00:02:07.630> amazing<00:02:08.020> I<00:02:08.470> don't<00:02:09.069> even<00:02:09.159> think

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
it's not amazing I don't even think

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.940 
it's not amazing I don't even think
these<00:02:09.610> qualifiers<00:02:10.090> you<00:02:10.569> know<00:02:10.659> 11<00:02:11.319> megapixel

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
these qualifiers you know 11 megapixel

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:12.720 
these qualifiers you know 11 megapixel
cameras

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
cameras

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.130 
cameras
similar<00:02:12.940> to<00:02:13.060> the<00:02:13.180> iPads<00:02:13.569> I<00:02:13.810> think<00:02:13.959> there's

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
similar to the iPads I think there's

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.030 
similar to the iPads I think there's
somewhere<00:02:14.379> around<00:02:14.760> 0.5<00:02:15.760> to<00:02:16.030> 0.8<00:02:17.040> technically

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
somewhere around 0.5 to 0.8 technically

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.830 
somewhere around 0.5 to 0.8 technically
a<00:02:18.069> high-definition<00:02:18.549> camera<00:02:19.299> because<00:02:19.569> it<00:02:19.690> can

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
a high-definition camera because it can

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.610 
a high-definition camera because it can
do<00:02:19.930> 720p<00:02:20.370> as<00:02:21.370> far<00:02:21.640> as<00:02:21.760> as<00:02:21.940> far<00:02:21.970> as<00:02:22.239> I<00:02:22.299> know<00:02:22.620> but

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
do 720p as far as as far as I know but

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.350 
do 720p as far as as far as I know but
but<00:02:23.890> nothing<00:02:24.430> nothing<00:02:24.879> to<00:02:24.970> write<00:02:25.090> home<00:02:25.150> about

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
but nothing nothing to write home about

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.030 
but nothing nothing to write home about
you<00:02:25.780> wouldn't<00:02:25.989> be<00:02:26.080> taking<00:02:26.349> this<00:02:26.590> out<00:02:26.830> and

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
you wouldn't be taking this out and

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.100 
you wouldn't be taking this out and
using<00:02:27.670> it<00:02:27.879> as<00:02:28.030> your<00:02:28.209> main<00:02:28.330> source<00:02:28.599> of<00:02:28.780> taking

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
using it as your main source of taking

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.320 
using it as your main source of taking
pictures<00:02:29.500> again<00:02:30.160> these<00:02:30.459> these<00:02:30.760> cameras<00:02:31.239> are

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
pictures again these these cameras are

pictures again these these cameras are
basically<00:02:31.810> on<00:02:32.019> here<00:02:32.319> as<00:02:32.440> a<00:02:32.470> means<00:02:32.890> of<00:02:33.420> doing

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
basically on here as a means of doing

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.150 
basically on here as a means of doing
like<00:02:34.660> video<00:02:35.110> chat<00:02:35.470> and<00:02:35.680> things<00:02:35.920> like<00:02:36.099> that

once that's released seems like every

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.479 
once that's released seems like every
device<00:02:39.340> that<00:02:39.670> they<00:02:39.760> put<00:02:39.940> out<00:02:40.030> these<00:02:40.209> days<00:02:40.510> um

that's mostly that's mostly the camera
app<00:02:48.459> there<00:02:48.790> I<00:02:49.209> thought<00:02:49.870> there<00:02:50.140> was<00:02:50.260> a<00:02:50.530> method

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
app there I thought there was a method

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.800 
app there I thought there was a method
to<00:02:51.190> take<00:02:51.430> videos<00:02:51.970> in<00:02:52.299> here<00:02:52.540> but<00:02:52.690> there

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
to take videos in here but there

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.780 
to take videos in here but there
actually<00:02:52.959> is<00:02:53.319> not<00:02:53.560> so<00:02:54.129> as<00:02:54.280> of<00:02:54.310> right<00:02:54.430> now<00:02:54.579> there

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
actually is not so as of right now there

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.699 
actually is not so as of right now there
is<00:02:54.940> no<00:02:55.120> method<00:02:55.299> of<00:02:55.540> taking<00:02:55.690> videos<00:02:56.200> on<00:02:56.379> a<00:02:56.410> Vita

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
is no method of taking videos on a Vita

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.770 
is no method of taking videos on a Vita
at<00:02:56.890> all<00:02:57.040> just<00:02:57.430> so<00:02:57.609> you<00:02:57.670> know<00:02:57.849> it's<00:02:58.510> something

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
at all just so you know it's something

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.300 
at all just so you know it's something
that<00:02:58.900> could<00:02:59.019> easily<00:02:59.230> add<00:02:59.530> in<00:02:59.739> the<00:02:59.829> future<00:03:00.160> I'm

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
that could easily add in the future I'm

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.780 
that could easily add in the future I'm
surprised<00:03:00.849> it's<00:03:01.120> not<00:03:01.209> in<00:03:01.629> this<00:03:01.810> app<00:03:02.079> itself<00:03:02.790> so

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
surprised it's not in this app itself so

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.160 
surprised it's not in this app itself so
yeah<00:03:03.940> we'll<00:03:04.090> see<00:03:04.239> if<00:03:04.329> that<00:03:04.390> gets<00:03:04.629> added<00:03:04.900> in<00:03:05.140> the

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
yeah we'll see if that gets added in the

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.680 
yeah we'll see if that gets added in the
future<00:03:05.560> um<00:03:05.769> you<00:03:06.730> know<00:03:06.819> obviously<00:03:07.090> when<00:03:07.599> the

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
future um you know obviously when the

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.030 
future um you know obviously when the
skype<00:03:07.930> app<00:03:08.109> comes<00:03:08.440> and<00:03:08.680> things<00:03:08.859> like<00:03:08.980> that

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
skype app comes and things like that

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.039 
skype app comes and things like that
there<00:03:09.489> will<00:03:09.579> be<00:03:09.609> a<00:03:09.670> lot<00:03:09.849> more<00:03:09.879> uses<00:03:10.390> for<00:03:10.420> both

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
there will be a lot more uses for both

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:13.680 
there will be a lot more uses for both
of<00:03:11.200> the<00:03:11.260> cameras<00:03:11.879> why<00:03:12.879> don't<00:03:13.150> now<00:03:13.359> we<00:03:13.420> get<00:03:13.660> into

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
of the cameras why don't now we get into

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.530 
of the cameras why don't now we get into

and to consider the AR and mingle all
you<00:03:58.069> do<00:03:58.310> is<00:03:58.549> pop<00:03:58.849> into<00:03:59.120> the<00:03:59.239> game<00:03:59.390> going<00:03:59.659> to

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
you do is pop into the game going to

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.800 
you do is pop into the game going to
data<00:04:00.200> at<00:04:00.409> the<00:04:00.469> very<00:04:00.739> bottom<00:04:01.629> we're<00:04:02.629> going<00:04:02.750> to

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
data at the very bottom we're going to

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.759 
data at the very bottom we're going to
go<00:04:02.870> into<00:04:02.900> profile<00:04:03.439> so<00:04:04.340> basically<00:04:04.609> the<00:04:04.819> AR<00:04:05.269> is

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769 
go into profile so basically the AR is

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:09.250 
go into profile so basically the AR is
allowing<00:04:06.769> you<00:04:06.859> to<00:04:07.010> project<00:04:07.459> characters<00:04:08.260> you
