00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
this was actually quite a surprise

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.510 
this was actually quite a surprise
because<00:01:19.140> actually<00:01:19.650> didn't<00:01:19.920> think<00:01:20.100> they'd<00:01:20.310> do

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
because actually didn't think they'd do

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.289 
because actually didn't think they'd do
it<00:01:20.700> because<00:01:21.150> that<00:01:22.280> TT<00:01:23.280> games<00:01:23.490> is<00:01:23.759> more<00:01:24.090> of<00:01:24.180> a

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
it because that TT games is more of a

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.969 
it because that TT games is more of a
Warner<00:01:24.659> based<00:01:24.900> company<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.970> they've<00:01:26.970> done

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
Warner based company and they've done

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:33.010 
Warner based company and they've done
movies<00:01:28.979> have<00:01:29.189> long<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.659> Warner<00:01:31.560> Brothers

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
movies have long to the Warner Brothers

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.340 
movies have long to the Warner Brothers
franchise<00:01:34.020> like<00:01:34.549> Batman<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:36.020> Harry<00:01:37.020> Potter

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
franchise like Batman and Harry Potter

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.270 
franchise like Batman and Harry Potter
which<00:01:37.740> were<00:01:37.979> really<00:01:38.460> successful<00:01:38.700> but<00:01:39.659> I<00:01:40.280> think

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
which were really successful but I think

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.240 
which were really successful but I think
it's<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.640> good<00:01:41.850> idea<00:01:42.030> that<00:01:42.420> they've<00:01:42.630> gone

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
it's a good idea that they've gone

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.410 
it's a good idea that they've gone
beyond<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.610> Warner<00:01:45.270> Brothers<00:01:46.100> franchise<00:01:47.420> and

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
beyond the Warner Brothers franchise and

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.389 
beyond the Warner Brothers franchise and
I'm<00:01:49.020> actually<00:01:49.259> really<00:01:49.619> excited<00:01:49.799> about<00:01:50.280> this

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
you don't know what it is because little

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.130 
you don't know what it is because little
detail<00:02:13.750> has<00:02:14.380> been<00:02:14.410> released<00:02:15.070> about<00:02:15.280> the<00:02:15.640> game

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
but it's interesting to see that the way

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.860 
but it's interesting to see that the way
this<00:02:21.250> game<00:02:21.460> would<00:02:21.610> go<00:02:21.670> because<00:02:22.240> it<00:02:22.570> could<00:02:22.840> be
