00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
pale pink highlighter color it's really

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.080 
pretty the I know the other shades they

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
do have a silver-toned highlighter which

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.569 
do have a silver-toned highlighter which
I<00:03:39.599> don't<00:03:39.660> really<00:03:39.840> like<00:03:39.959> silver<00:03:40.470> tone<00:03:40.709> so<00:03:41.010> i<00:03:41.220> got

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
I don't really like silver tone so i got

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:43.520 
I don't really like silver tone so i got
this<00:03:41.730> pale<00:03:42.090> pink<00:03:42.419> one<00:03:42.599> they<00:03:42.720> also<00:03:42.870> have<00:03:43.260> more

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
this pale pink one they also have more

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.879 
this pale pink one they also have more
of<00:03:44.220> a<00:03:44.400> tanning<00:03:44.910> bronzy<00:03:45.660> yellowish<00:03:46.319> golden

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:46.889 
of a tanning bronzy yellowish golden

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:49.339 
of a tanning bronzy yellowish golden
color<00:03:47.160> and<00:03:47.459> that<00:03:48.060> one<00:03:48.269> is<00:03:48.299> probably<00:03:48.959> really

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:49.349 
color and that one is probably really

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:51.409 
color and that one is probably really
good<00:03:49.500> for<00:03:50.010> those<00:03:50.160> with<00:03:50.519> Tanner<00:03:50.819> skin<00:03:51.180> tone<00:03:51.389> I

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:51.419 
good for those with Tanner skin tone I

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:52.879 
good for those with Tanner skin tone I
think<00:03:51.720> it<00:03:51.810> would<00:03:51.900> be<00:03:51.989> really<00:03:52.139> nice<00:03:52.349> color<00:03:52.680> I

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:52.889 
think it would be really nice color I

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:54.890 
think it would be really nice color I
like<00:03:53.639> this<00:03:53.790> highlighter<00:03:54.150> because<00:03:54.540> it<00:03:54.750> just

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
like this highlighter because it just

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.750 
like this highlighter because it just
blends<00:03:55.230> so<00:03:55.530> well<00:03:55.560> into<00:03:55.950> my<00:03:56.069> skin<00:03:56.430> I'm<00:03:56.639> not

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
writing right now because it's kind of

00:03:57.989 --> 00:03:59.780 
writing right now because it's kind of
hot<00:03:58.230> right<00:03:58.260> now<00:03:58.560> and<00:03:58.590> I'm<00:03:59.010> already<00:03:59.160> sweating

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:08.639 
do it in a tapping motion instead of a

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:10.159 
do it in a tapping motion instead of a
blending<00:04:09.000> motion<00:04:09.329> because<00:04:09.569> I<00:04:09.599> don't<00:04:09.840> want<00:04:09.900> it

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:10.169 
blending motion because I don't want it

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:13.129 
blending motion because I don't want it
to<00:04:10.349> mix<00:04:10.950> in<00:04:11.099> with<00:04:11.250> my<00:04:11.430> foundation<00:04:11.579> but<00:04:12.569> this<00:04:12.900> is

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:13.139 
to mix in with my foundation but this is

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:15.349 
to mix in with my foundation but this is
my<00:04:13.290> favorite<00:04:13.590> out<00:04:14.010> of<00:04:14.069> like<00:04:14.639> everything<00:04:15.180> this

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:15.359 
my favorite out of like everything this

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:17.029 
my favorite out of like everything this
is<00:04:15.419> probably<00:04:16.019> my<00:04:16.260> all-time<00:04:16.440> favorite

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:17.039 
is probably my all-time favorite

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:18.710 
is probably my all-time favorite
highlighter<00:04:17.190> it's<00:04:17.849> just<00:04:18.060> so<00:04:18.209> nice<00:04:18.450> it's

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
highlighter it's just so nice it's

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.509

really<00:04:18.810> similar<00:04:19.229> to<00:04:19.380> be<00:04:19.709> benefit<00:04:20.130> high<00:04:20.280> beam
