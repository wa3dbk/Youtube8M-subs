00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
head but he's writing key this same K so

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.540 
head but he's writing key this same K so
here's<00:01:01.500> how<00:01:01.649> it<00:01:01.800> starts<00:01:02.129> it<00:01:02.219> starts<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.520> the

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
here's how it starts it starts to the

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:12.160 
here's how it starts it starts to the
chord<00:01:02.850> progression<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.600> minor

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:22.750 

so<00:01:12.860> a<00:01:13.390> minor<00:01:15.370> F<00:01:17.920> D<00:01:19.780> G<00:01:20.780> and<00:01:21.140> the<00:01:21.770> G<00:01:22.010> sets<00:01:22.340> us<00:01:22.580> up

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:22.760 
so a minor F D G and the G sets us up

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:29.190 
so a minor F D G and the G sets us up
sets<00:01:23.180> us<00:01:23.360> up<00:01:23.510> for<00:01:23.750> this<00:01:23.840> progression<00:01:28.000> and

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
sets us up for this progression and

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:37.340 
sets us up for this progression and
that's<00:01:30.200> C<00:01:31.330> F<00:01:32.330> G

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.630 

well<00:01:38.350> if<00:01:38.470> you<00:01:38.560> call<00:01:38.680> the<00:01:38.860> one<00:01:39.040> four<00:01:39.369> five

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
well if you call the one four five

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.330 
well if you call the one four five
progression<00:01:39.700> which<00:01:40.479> is<00:01:40.659> very<00:01:40.960> very<00:01:41.340> common

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
progression which is very very common

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.950 
progression which is very very common
and<00:01:42.700> a<00:01:42.850> lot<00:01:43.030> of<00:01:43.119> different<00:01:43.390> styles<00:01:43.570> of<00:01:43.810> music

and a lot of different styles of music

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.460 
and a lot of different styles of music
especially<00:01:44.350> rock<00:01:45.130> and<00:01:45.400> pop<00:01:45.580> music<00:01:46.259> so<00:01:47.259> here's

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
especially rock and pop music so here's

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:48.600 
especially rock and pop music so here's
the<00:01:47.560> way<00:01:47.680> that<00:01:47.860> works<00:01:48.040> here's<00:01:48.340> the<00:01:48.460> beginning

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
the way that works here's the beginning

00:01:48.610 --> 00:02:31.630 
the way that works here's the beginning
a<00:01:49.000> minor<00:02:10.500> G<00:02:15.420> B<00:02:17.040> which<00:02:18.040> goes<00:02:18.340> to<00:02:25.319> me

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.280 

that'd<00:02:32.640> be<00:02:32.670> I'm<00:02:33.120> playing<00:02:33.420> as<00:02:33.570> a<00:02:33.600> power<00:02:33.900> chord

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
that'd be I'm playing as a power chord

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.810 
that'd be I'm playing as a power chord
if<00:02:34.530> you're<00:02:34.650> not<00:02:34.800> familiar<00:02:34.980> with<00:02:35.130> power<00:02:35.400> chords

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
those three strings and then it just

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.350 
those three strings and then it just
ends<00:03:05.510> on<00:03:06.510> the<00:03:06.690> E<00:03:06.720> chord<00:03:07.370> so<00:03:08.370> that's<00:03:09.210> the

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
ends on the E chord so that's the

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.720 
ends on the E chord so that's the
progression<00:03:09.510> it<00:03:10.440> changes<00:03:10.890> keys<00:03:11.130> it<00:03:11.370> starts

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
progression it changes keys it starts

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.240 
progression it changes keys it starts
off<00:03:11.940> after<00:03:12.600> the<00:03:12.720> little<00:03:12.990> intro<00:03:13.350> progression

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
off after the little intro progression

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:20.420 
off after the little intro progression
the<00:03:14.670> key<00:03:14.850> of<00:03:14.970> C<00:03:18.530> and<00:03:19.530> then<00:03:19.680> it<00:03:19.860> when<00:03:20.100> we<00:03:20.220> go<00:03:20.370> to

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
the key of C and then it when we go to

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.170 
the key of C and then it when we go to
the<00:03:20.610> a<00:03:20.640> chord

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
the a chord

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.309 
the a chord
we're<00:03:22.780> changing<00:03:23.200> to<00:03:23.230> the<00:03:23.439> key<00:03:23.650> of<00:03:23.709> D<00:03:23.980> one<00:03:25.319> four

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 
we're changing to the key of D one four

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:30.509 
we're changing to the key of D one four
five<00:03:27.159> progression<00:03:27.220> in<00:03:28.120> D<00:03:28.360> and<00:03:29.310> we're<00:03:30.310> going<00:03:30.459> to

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
five progression in D and we're going to

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:33.390 
five progression in D and we're going to
be<00:03:31.079> we're<00:03:32.079> changing<00:03:32.530> to<00:03:32.560> one<00:03:32.920> four<00:03:33.159> five

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
be we're changing to one four five

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:42.599 
be we're changing to one four five
progression<00:03:40.109> so<00:03:41.109> it's<00:03:41.439> a<00:03:41.799> great<00:03:42.129> side<00:03:42.340> for

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:42.609 
progression so it's a great side for

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:44.729 
progression so it's a great side for
beginner<00:03:42.939> you're<00:03:43.239> gonna<00:03:43.540> get<00:03:43.750> to<00:03:43.900> use<00:03:44.079> all<00:03:44.349> the

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
beginner you're gonna get to use all the

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:49.500 
beginner you're gonna get to use all the
basic<00:03:45.129> chord<00:03:45.370> shapes<00:03:45.730> and<00:03:48.239> it'll<00:03:49.239> help<00:03:49.359> you

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
basic chord shapes and it'll help you

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:50.910 
basic chord shapes and it'll help you
understand<00:03:49.959> music<00:03:50.230> theory<00:03:50.470> a<00:03:50.500> little<00:03:50.590> bit<00:03:50.799> if

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
understand music theory a little bit if

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.589 
understand music theory a little bit if
you<00:03:50.950> know<00:03:51.189> that<00:03:51.459> we're<00:03:51.609> changing<00:03:51.640> keys<00:03:52.329> you'll

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:52.599 
you know that we're changing keys you'll

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:55.050 
you know that we're changing keys you'll
probably<00:03:52.810> be<00:03:53.230> able<00:03:53.290> to<00:03:53.409> hear<00:03:53.680> that<00:03:53.920> and<00:03:54.190> and

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
probably be able to hear that and and

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.000 
probably be able to hear that and and
see<00:03:55.299> how<00:03:55.450> that<00:03:55.629> works<00:03:55.870> it's<00:03:56.109> it's<00:03:56.379> clever<00:03:56.650> song

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
see how that works it's it's clever song

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.369 
see how that works it's it's clever song
writing<00:03:57.599> so<00:03:58.599> we'll<00:03:58.870> go<00:03:58.959> through<00:03:59.170> the<00:03:59.260> whole

00:03:59.369 --> 00:03:59.379 
writing so we'll go through the whole

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:01.050 
writing so we'll go through the whole
thing<00:03:59.709> starts<00:04:00.280> at<00:04:00.400> the<00:04:00.489> little<00:04:00.760> intro

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
thing starts at the little intro

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:08.050 
thing starts at the little intro
progression<00:04:01.599> a<00:04:01.810> minor<00:04:03.450> F

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:23.520 

gee

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:40.219 

gggg

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:40.229 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:48.180 

maybe<00:04:45.750> that's<00:04:46.750> it<00:04:46.930> that's<00:04:47.169> the<00:04:47.470> that's<00:04:48.099> the

maybe that's it that's the that's the

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:49.950 
maybe that's it that's the that's the
whole<00:04:48.370> song<00:04:48.610> the<00:04:49.120> way<00:04:49.240> is<00:04:49.360> played<00:04:49.599> at<00:04:49.840> the
