00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:27.830 
for us she still look good and like I

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:29.740 
for us she still look good and like I
said<00:06:27.890> before<00:06:28.100> prior<00:06:28.790> I<00:06:29.150> like<00:06:29.360> the<00:06:29.510> pineapple

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:29.750 
said before prior I like the pineapple

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:33.160 
said before prior I like the pineapple
method<00:06:30.380> because<00:06:31.000> it<00:06:32.000> does<00:06:32.330> help<00:06:32.660> kind<00:06:33.050> of

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:33.170 
method because it does help kind of

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:35.530 
method because it does help kind of
elongate<00:06:33.740> the<00:06:33.860> curl<00:06:34.130> a<00:06:34.160> little<00:06:34.250> bit<00:06:34.550> more<00:06:34.790> so

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:35.540 
elongate the curl a little bit more so

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:39.220 
elongate the curl a little bit more so
you<00:06:35.600> do<00:06:36.080> get<00:06:36.380> a<00:06:37.030> bounce<00:06:38.030> your<00:06:38.390> look<00:06:38.660> and<00:06:39.050> you

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:39.230 
you do get a bounce your look and you

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:41.260 
you do get a bounce your look and you
get<00:06:39.470> more<00:06:39.680> length<00:06:40.040> than<00:06:40.190> with<00:06:40.580> doing<00:06:40.970> like<00:06:41.120> the

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:41.270 
get more length than with doing like the

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:43.090 
get more length than with doing like the
flexi<00:06:41.690> rods<00:06:41.960> and<00:06:42.350> things<00:06:42.410> like<00:06:42.680> that<00:06:42.740> to

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:43.100 
flexi rods and things like that to

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.160 
flexi rods and things like that to
maintain<00:06:44.090> the<00:06:44.270> clothes<00:06:44.450> and<00:06:44.660> I<00:06:44.720> also<00:06:44.900> like

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:45.170 
maintain the clothes and I also like

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:48.160 
maintain the clothes and I also like
this<00:06:45.350> method<00:06:45.740> better<00:06:45.920> than<00:06:46.190> doing<00:06:46.670> the<00:06:47.390> pin

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:48.170 
this method better than doing the pin

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:51.580 
this method better than doing the pin
