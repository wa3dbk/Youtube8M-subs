there and if left connected and then

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.170 
there and if left connected and then
you're<00:01:31.890> messing<00:01:32.190> with<00:01:32.220> this<00:01:32.430> plate<00:01:32.729> in<00:01:32.880> here

that and leaving it energized while

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.359 
that and leaving it energized while
doing<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:45.660> it<00:01:46.500> is<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.400> primary<00:01:47.700> cause<00:01:49.369> the

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
doing that it is the primary cause the

doing that it is the primary cause the
other<00:01:50.550> problem<00:01:51.150> is<00:01:51.240> is<00:01:51.660> safety<00:01:52.729> this<00:01:53.729> motor

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
other problem is is safety this motor

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.730 
other problem is is safety this motor
and<00:01:54.509> there's<00:01:54.810> a<00:01:54.869> net<00:01:55.020> reduction<00:01:55.560> set<00:01:56.250> in<00:01:56.399> here

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
and there's a net reduction set in here

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.040 
and there's a net reduction set in here
can<00:01:58.740> actually<00:01:58.920> according<00:01:59.580> to<00:01:59.729> Ford<00:02:00.149> if<00:02:00.929> you

key off somebody's throttle bodies do a

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.990 
key off somebody's throttle bodies do a
sweep<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:07.039> they<00:02:08.810> have<00:02:09.810> ice<00:02:10.200> breakage

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
sweep and they have ice breakage

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.170 
sweep and they have ice breakage
strategies<00:02:12.170> built<00:02:13.170> into<00:02:13.530> them<00:02:13.910> and<00:02:14.910> stuff

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
strategies built into them and stuff

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.830 
strategies built into them and stuff
like<00:02:15.360> that

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
like that

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.990 
like that
either<00:02:16.380> way<00:02:16.680> it's<00:02:17.040> a<00:02:17.130> high<00:02:17.250> torque<00:02:17.460> motor<00:02:17.700> and

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
either way it's a high torque motor and

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.950 
either way it's a high torque motor and
a<00:02:18.660> gear<00:02:18.840> reduction<00:02:19.290> gear<00:02:19.500> set<00:02:19.770> and<00:02:20.780> what<00:02:21.780> they

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
a gear reduction gear set and what they

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.050 
a gear reduction gear set and what they
say<00:02:22.230> is<00:02:22.260> that<00:02:22.710> if<00:02:23.010> you're<00:02:23.220> in<00:02:23.340> your<00:02:23.490> clean<00:02:23.790> this

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
say is that if you're in your clean this

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.440 
say is that if you're in your clean this
nothing<00:02:24.630> activates<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.410> clothes<00:02:26.270> it<00:02:27.270> can

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
nothing activates the clothes it can

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.440 
nothing activates the clothes it can
actually<00:02:27.750> chop<00:02:27.960> your<00:02:28.140> finger<00:02:28.470> off<00:02:29.120> never<00:02:30.120> seen

it I don't want to try it it's got a
regular<00:02:32.940> spring<00:02:33.540> return<00:02:33.840> on<00:02:33.990> there's<00:02:34.200> like

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
regular spring return on there's like

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.570 
regular spring return on there's like
any<00:02:34.440> throttle<00:02:35.160> body<00:02:37.100> but<00:02:38.100> that<00:02:38.280> motor<00:02:38.520> is

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
any throttle body but that motor is

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.090 
any throttle body but that motor is
energized<00:02:39.150> and<00:02:40.050> it<00:02:40.620> snaps<00:02:40.950> back<00:02:41.100> watch<00:02:41.880> out<00:02:42.150> I

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
energized and it snaps back watch out I

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:48.440 
energized and it snaps back watch out I
don't<00:02:44.100> want<00:02:44.400> to<00:02:44.490> try<00:02:44.670> it

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.830 

nice<00:02:49.450> one<00:02:49.960> again<00:02:50.700> took<00:02:51.700> a<00:02:51.819> soft<00:02:52.150> bristle<00:02:52.569> brush

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
nice one again took a soft bristle brush

00:02:52.840 --> 00:03:02.970 
nice one again took a soft bristle brush
and<00:02:54.780> you<00:02:55.780> really<00:02:56.110> get<00:02:56.380> it<00:02:56.500> all<00:02:56.680> on<00:02:56.740> edges<00:03:01.950> use<00:03:02.950> a

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
and you really get it all on edges use a

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:30.479 
and you really get it all on edges use a
plastic<00:03:03.459> brush<00:03:06.510> don't<00:03:07.510> use<00:03:07.660> any<00:03:07.959> metal

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:35.740 

then<00:03:31.510> silver<00:03:32.510> rag<00:03:34.239> in<00:03:35.239> the<00:03:35.329> throttle<00:03:35.659> body

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
then silver rag in the throttle body

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.220 
then silver rag in the throttle body
cleaner<00:03:36.849> so<00:03:37.849> once<00:03:38.060> you<00:03:38.180> soak<00:03:38.420> that<00:03:38.659> right<00:03:38.930> then

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
cleaner so once you soak that right then

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:47.089 
cleaner so once you soak that right then
you<00:03:39.349> can<00:03:39.530> get<00:03:39.709> in<00:03:39.890> here<00:03:41.349> lift<00:03:42.349> the<00:03:42.500> plate

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:51.199 

and<00:03:47.310> clean<00:03:47.670> where<00:03:47.909> it<00:03:48.000> seats<00:03:48.360> in<00:03:48.599> there<00:03:50.209> and

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
and clean where it seats in there and
