00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Juan Manuel Fangio, a name that will mean a lot for Maserati.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
During his second season of European racing

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
the Argentine chose to run with a 4 CL T 48 and

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
won his very first race in Sanremo on the Ospedaletti circuit,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
continuing the 1949 season, with important successes.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
In the same year in the Grand Prix of Lausanne

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Farina confirmed Maserati 4 T 48 CL success.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Farina the following year became the first Formula 1 world champion, driving an Alfa Romeo. Maserati instead went on the track with private drivers.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
In 1951 to win the world championship of Formula 1 was Fangio on Alfa Romeo

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
but in another prestigious event, the street circuit of Parist the winner was Farina,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
the reigning world champion, with a Maserati 4 CL T.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Maserati, considering not competitive enough their single-seat car,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
developed the new 6 GCM with a 2-liter and 6-cylinder engine

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:31.000
respecting the new Formula 1 rules and asigned it to Fangio.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
But a serious accident in Monza prevented Fangio from racing throughout the season.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
For Maserati the year that was supposed to be a revival year

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
was a recovery and waiting year, only at the Grand Prix of Italy in Monza,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Froilan Gonzalez and Felice Bonetto and competed with Ascari and Ferrari,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
already world champions, winning at the end of the second and fifth place,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
with their Maseratis 6 GCM.
