 new chapters entered the whole book became 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:35.260
 more information even a little 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:38.120
 appearance has changed a little in order 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:41.870
 This is how the book looked like in previous ones. 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.730
 versions before the beginning of 2012 was such 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.070
 the cover then happened small 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.890
 rebranding and the book began to look like this 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:56.150
 so now I 'll show you how it looks 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:58.330
 already in the new edition of 2013 like this 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:01.430
 now looks like a new cover of circulation 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:04.129
 2013 there are no major changes 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:07.310
 Is that what changed the tonality 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.990
 picture with the autumn mood on the summer well 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.799
 how do we accept this not all changes 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.240
 who went into the book 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:16.220
 friends and now I offer briefly 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:22.910
 review and changes that came in 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:25.160
 informational part of the book and so I'll start with 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:27.140
 The main book included all amendments to 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.440
 code of administrative offenses 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.890
 which entered into force on September 1 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.370
 year 2013 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.200
 their sixty eight pieces is that 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.210
 regards to those who need to know 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.490
 motorists are actually much 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.500
 more well there are already more subtle matter 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.310
 which you are likely to everyday 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.720
 life is not useful 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.240
 of course all these changes came in 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.220
 relevant chapters of the book but when you 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.430
 have such a list in front of you 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.500
 it will be easier to navigate 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.060
 from this many changes probably 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.580
 I would like to highlight the three most 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.650
 pleasant drivers for the first is 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.510
 changed speed limit at which 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.700
 drivers start to insure that is 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.909
 if it used to be 10 km per hour now 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.830
 this is 20 km per hour the second 

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:15.680
 now the DPS inspector has no right 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.310
 withdraw driver's license this 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.870
 the function was handed over to the courts and 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.909
 accordingly , this is followed by the third 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.700
 changes which allows now not 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:27.950
 take time off after the expiration date 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.430
 deprivation because now it simply does not 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.530
 issue all changes for your convenience 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.889
 located at the beginning of the book they go 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.349
 one after another according to 

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:41.180
 ascending 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:43.159
 friends want to draw your attention that 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.930
 dramatically changed the order 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:47.779
 appealing against inspector actions and 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.939
 protocol cancellation procedure if earlier we 

00:02:47.779 --> 00:02:53.499
 all sent to the prosecutor's office now 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:56.209
 papers are issued to the world court 

00:02:53.499 --> 00:02:57.560
 why precisely in court because when 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.239
 current legislation 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.849
 This is the most effective way to defend 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:04.489
 your rights to present your arguments about 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:07.459
 innocence or disagreement with the violation 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:09.279
 at the same time the judge may consider your 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.269
 arguments to decide on termination 

00:03:09.279 --> 00:03:13.459
 administrative affairs in everyday life we 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:15.769
 call it protocol abolition 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:18.290
 if you still have a claim 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:20.689
 personal behavior 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.299
 inspectors personally directly to you 

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:24.799
 then, respectively, all complaints can be 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:28.819
 send to the old address in 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:31.189
 the prosecutor's office the next addition to 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:33.349
 the book is the inclusion of the full text 

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:34.700
 traffic rules as amended on 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:36.290
 year 2013 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.879
 that is, now you do not need to carry with 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.439
 I separately ask in traffic 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:41.439
 you will always have it at hand 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.659
 dear residents of Moscow and 

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:46.760
 St. Petersburg 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:49.219
 now in pictures and violation patterns 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:52.900
 All necessary articles are taken into account. 

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:55.669
 concern residents of these two cities 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.379
 driving penalty table friends 

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:59.749
 of course she did not go unheeded 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:02.469
 it includes all legislative 

00:03:59.749 --> 00:04:05.659
 the changes I talked about at the beginning 

00:04:02.469 --> 00:04:07.849
 a new head has entered the book called 

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:09.379
 how from a sober driver do drunk 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:11.180
 ways to counter 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:13.489
 in fact, it is very voluminous 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.599
 talks about clever methods and techniques 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:17.510
 DPS inspectors 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:22.250
 when conducting an alcohol test therefore 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:24.440
 I advise you to study it personally in the book 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.690
 sample application entered the court 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.610
 in order to cancel the order for 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:32.440
 speeding violation which 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:35.410
 was filmed on the camera photo and video recordings 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.530
 A new chapter has entered the book about 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.750
 video recorders 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:41.150
 practice of applying in court many 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.890
 drivers are constantly shooting 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.860
 but few of them know how to 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:49.970
 use it if it suddenly came 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:52.760
 before the trial a new chapter entered the book 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:55.190
 pitfalls auto insurance 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.260
 in it you can see what 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:59.180
 cunning tricks use insurance 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:01.040
 companies against drivers and 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:04.520
 accordingly as a driver can 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:06.290
 fight these tricks yet 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.780
 additional chapter in the book is 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:11.600
 the turn on a small radius was very 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.580
 controversial issue a lot of discussion on it 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.050
 in order to understand what is at stake 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:19.010
 better for the driver to get acquainted 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:20.660
 directly next new 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:22.850
 chapter in the book is overtaking in the zone 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:25.610
 limited visibility it is detailed 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:29.570
 will tell the driver when he breaks but 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:31.400
 don't even suspect it especially 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:33.740
 I wanted to draw attention to the fact that 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:36.440
 Substantially updated chapter correctly 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:37.640
 fill the protocol because we remember that 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:41.930
 exactly with the correct filling 

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:43.970
 protocols begins your defense for 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.990
 convenience of drivers especially those who are still 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:48.260
 was not brought to administrative 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:52.310
 responsibility included in the book form 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:54.530
 protocol friends i'm short now to you 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:56.450
 probably told about the most important and 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:06:00.169
 the most significant changes that have entered 

00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:03.020
 in the book but I want to pay attention that I 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:05.630
 68 amendments that lawmakers made 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:08.000
 in the code of administrative offenses 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:10.340
 respectively included in all chapters in 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.560
 in a sense, each head is slightly 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:15.030
 exchanged exchanged degree 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:17.640
 responsibility of drivers therefore dr 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:20.310
 I will effectively study the book in 

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:23.000
 Good luck to you on the roads of all 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:23.000
 kind
