a<00:02:33.390> good<00:02:33.630> keeper<00:02:34.050> they<00:02:34.230> have<00:02:34.440> good<00:02:34.709> good

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
a good keeper they have good good

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.910 
a good keeper they have good good
defenders<00:02:35.640> and<00:02:35.910> there<00:02:36.150> they<00:02:36.630> tend<00:02:37.350> to<00:02:37.470> attack

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
defenders and there they tend to attack

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.060 
defenders and there they tend to attack
more<00:02:38.550> than<00:02:38.730> they<00:02:38.910> tend<00:02:39.209> to<00:02:39.270> defend<00:02:39.720> and<00:02:40.070> when

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
more than they tend to defend and when

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.740 
more than they tend to defend and when
it's<00:02:41.220> like<00:02:41.400> that<00:02:41.640> and<00:02:41.850> when<00:02:41.880> they<00:02:42.120> play<00:02:42.360> on<00:02:42.510> sun

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
it's like that and when they play on sun

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.500 
it's like that and when they play on sun
0<00:02:43.050> then<00:02:43.800> you<00:02:44.130> then<00:02:44.490> you're<00:02:44.790> sure<00:02:45.090> that<00:02:45.330> some

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
0 then you then you're sure that some

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.240 
0 then you then you're sure that some
Doria<00:02:45.810> will<00:02:45.989> have<00:02:46.200> limited<00:02:46.380> chances<00:02:46.860> to<00:02:47.160> score

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
Doria will have limited chances to score

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.150 
Doria will have limited chances to score
so<00:02:48.080> 2.14<00:02:49.080> a<00:02:49.140> clean<00:02:49.380> sheet<00:02:49.650> is<00:02:49.950> worth

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
so 2.14 a clean sheet is worth

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.699 
so 2.14 a clean sheet is worth
