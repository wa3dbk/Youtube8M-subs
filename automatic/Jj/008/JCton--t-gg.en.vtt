00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
doesn't give you great living space but

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.440 
doesn't give you great living space but
it<00:03:55.470> is<00:03:55.560> the<00:03:55.710> strongest<00:03:56.190> shape<00:03:56.820> in<00:03:57.060> any<00:03:57.180> high

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
it is the strongest shape in any high

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:57.950 
it is the strongest shape in any high
winds

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:57.960 
winds

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.810 
winds
so<00:03:58.380> we<00:03:58.500> developed<00:03:58.890> a<00:03:59.010> system<00:03:59.370> called<00:03:59.400> tension

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
so we developed a system called tension

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.880 
so we developed a system called tension
band<00:04:00.210> which<00:04:00.660> can<00:04:00.810> be<00:04:00.930> clipped<00:04:01.230> and<00:04:01.410> unclipped

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
band which can be clipped and unclipped

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.830

depending<00:04:02.640> on<00:04:02.760> the<00:04:02.850> weather<00:04:03.030> and<00:04:03.480> by

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
depending on the weather and by

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.200 
depending on the weather and by
attaching<00:04:04.140> the<00:04:04.410> other<00:04:04.590> strap<00:04:05.010> we<00:04:05.820> create<00:04:06.120> that

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:06.210 
attaching the other strap we create that

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:08.390 
attaching the other strap we create that
perfect<00:04:06.510> triangle<00:04:07.290> which<00:04:07.620> stops<00:04:07.950> lateral

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
perfect triangle which stops lateral

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.750

the air beams that come with the system
as<00:04:49.800> I<00:04:49.980> said<00:04:50.160> earlier<00:04:50.520> air<00:04:50.760> beam<00:04:51.060> is<00:04:51.240> a

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
as I said earlier air beam is a

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.170 
as I said earlier air beam is a
technology<00:04:51.690> developed<00:04:51.930> by<00:04:52.350> wrangle<00:04:53.180> the

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
technology developed by wrangle the

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:55.730 
technology developed by wrangle the
beams<00:04:54.390> come<00:04:54.600> in<00:04:54.690> three<00:04:54.930> layers<00:04:55.140> making<00:04:55.500> them

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
beams come in three layers making them

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.340 
beams come in three layers making them
really<00:04:55.919> durable<00:04:56.460> and<00:04:56.730> solid<00:04:57.150> the<00:04:57.840> inflate<00:04:58.169> to

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
really durable and solid the inflate to

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.920 
really durable and solid the inflate to
seven<00:04:58.710> psi<00:04:59.340> which<00:04:59.790> makes<00:05:00.060> them<00:05:00.240> really<00:05:00.270> stable

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930

seven psi which makes them really stable
in<00:05:01.050> big<00:05:01.470> winds<00:05:01.740> it's<00:05:02.700> a<00:05:02.790> one-way<00:05:03.120> valve<00:05:03.150> system

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
in big winds it's a one-way valve system

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.900 
in big winds it's a one-way valve system
which<00:05:04.350> means<00:05:04.590> that<00:05:04.740> when<00:05:05.130> you<00:05:05.250> blow<00:05:05.460> it<00:05:05.580> up<00:05:05.730> you

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
which means that when you blow it up you

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.850 
which means that when you blow it up you
simply<00:05:06.210> pull<00:05:06.510> the<00:05:06.630> pump<00:05:06.870> out<00:05:07.110> and<00:05:07.320> the<00:05:07.680> beam

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 
simply pull the pump out and the beam

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.340 
simply pull the pump out and the beam
will<00:05:08.010> stay<00:05:08.190> up<00:05:08.310> so<00:05:08.580> if<00:05:08.669> I<00:05:08.760> undo<00:05:09.180> that<00:05:09.419> the<00:05:10.320> O

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.350 
will stay up so if I undo that the O

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.080 
will stay up so if I undo that the O
won't<00:05:10.650> come<00:05:10.890> out<00:05:10.980> it's<00:05:11.280> only<00:05:11.490> when<00:05:11.700> I<00:05:11.730> take<00:05:11.940> the

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
won't come out it's only when I take the

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.390 
won't come out it's only when I take the
main<00:05:12.240> valve<00:05:12.540> off<00:05:12.780> that<00:05:13.320> the<00:05:13.500> beam<00:05:14.010> will<00:05:14.220> come

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
main valve off that the beam will come
