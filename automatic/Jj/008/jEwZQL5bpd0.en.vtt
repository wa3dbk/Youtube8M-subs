00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:06.880
 very good everyone good in this video 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.730
 I will teach you how to have alliances 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:12.510
 many people have alliances but 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:15.150
 you are not here the solution 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:18.380
 As you see, everything is fine, it gives me the option 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.380
 to repair the zeppelin 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.280
 on the right side we will have what it is 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.280
 the temporary challenges 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.540
 on the left side we will have what 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.200
 is the global chan and chad of your team 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.200
 alliance 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:54.289
 good to have the alliances need 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.600
 uninstall the monster legens does not 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:59.899
 worry for that I'll leave the ark 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.530
 of the monster legends 3.0 that has the 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:02.530
 alliances 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:23.250
 it only weighs 44 megabytes 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.830
 very important if they play monsters 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.870
 legends in blue stacks I recommend them 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.910
 download it from the west tax if not 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:33.330
 will have to error to the installation if 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:36.890
 download on pc if they play it on mobile 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.890
 they only download it normal 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.820
 when they download it they just install it 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.820
 normal 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.330
 very important if they downloaded it in 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.640
 cell phone need to activate sources 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.790
 unknown to install the 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.790
 game 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.790
 when they have it installed the game only 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.310
 normal, but the 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:12.160
 start tutorial like that is first 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:14.830
 Once they play it, do all that 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:18.660
 after doing the start tutorial 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:21.240
 they go to game settings 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:26.330
 here they only connect their facebook account 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.330
 to the game so they will have everything they had 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:37.560
 and ready juas juas juas juas you'll have 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:40.080
 the alliances 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.660
 I hope this video works for you 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.790

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.430
