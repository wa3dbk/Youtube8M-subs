00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.659
 all right 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.600
 then other parts what we wanted 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.830
 it was that I followed so true that 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.690
 it lengthened a bit longer than 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.060
 we were waiting but in the end we got 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:24.430
 agree and I think that both 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.590
 parts we put of 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.250
 as much as we could and in the end we have 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.350
 got good especially 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.380
 I feel very loved by the fans 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:36.830
 I also believe that I am indebted to 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.720
 them for the last season that 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.860
 we got the descent and this year I think 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.840
 that together we can get the 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.420
 promotion and also the confidence that 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.340
 burner mister when I get there I think he has 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.600
 been a bit of everything and especially 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.360
 also that here I am very happy 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.790
 four years and if in a place is happy 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.510
 so that we change not what we set ourselves 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:59.280
 all the promotion that we all want but 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.739
 we also know that not make us 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.559
 January you have to go match to match with 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.399
 sanction in June and we will put all 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.250
 our part 

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:10.470
 my goal of doing as much as possible 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.540
 to help the team and also about 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.090
 all that brand that I have within reach for 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.100
 make the most of trajectory I never 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.220
 I thought about leaving here, yes it 's true 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.649
 that there were offers from other teams but 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.420
 my intention has always been the one who loves 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:26.759
 here and I always spoke with the club for the 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.800
 intend to be here and they me 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.960
 They also showed their interest that 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:34.100
 continue and I believe that from a 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.100
 principle the two parties 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:39.340
 I do not know how true a club is 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:42.430
 different to every subject I've been to 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.500
 many places in my career and where else 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.780
 at the pleasure of the state where where 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.300
 feels football where people live it 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.810
 more here and that you want that you do not get 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.400
 catches you let it not be here much 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.909
 time and if you're comfortable then last 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.369
 you know 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.469
 I wish the leaves and hopefully I can get 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.299
 that that mark that I have there close 

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:04.429
 to do more and new stories and 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:07.689
 Of course, it's a pride not the symbol 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:07.689
 of a club like the betis 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.660
 not here nobody feels like this all 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.250
 we work to try to be a starter 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.160
 later he decides he admits but yes he is 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.540
 truth that since I arrived admits more 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.970
 important sense in the team too 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.950
 it's been one of the things that I've 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.560
 stayed and I do one more than work 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.050
 as one more to get that that 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.740
 put in the initial 'eleven' and will have to 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.740
 fight all our 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:39.000
 if I was the last and what better to be 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.630
 here where I am happy and at ease and where 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.580
 people want me 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.040
 good compared to last year that everything 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.470
 it was the real upside down I did not do the 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.940
 preseason this year now that I 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.160
 I found very well I did not miss any 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.800
 training the only uncertainty that 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.780
 There was the renovation but well I 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.030
 that part train as one more in 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.730
 preseason I think that in the games I 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.010
 goals and I feel very well we are 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.780
 here training 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.230
 and I did not have an opportunity to see 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:14.440
 It is said that 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:14.440
 without ideals madrid
