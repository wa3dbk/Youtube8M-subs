00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
along and and that's it so well it's a

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.260 
along and and that's it so well it's a
bit<00:00:45.000> different<00:00:45.210> obviously<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:46.170> upside<00:00:47.270> very

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
bit different obviously the upside very

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.049 
bit different obviously the upside very
very<00:00:48.899> easy<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.410> use<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.430> buttons<00:00:50.789> are

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
very easy to use and the buttons are

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.639 
very easy to use and the buttons are
enormous<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:53.270> quite<00:00:54.270> yet<00:00:54.870> so<00:00:55.260> that's<00:00:55.440> easy

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
enormous and quite yet so that's easy

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.709 
enormous and quite yet so that's easy
for<00:00:55.949> dialing<00:00:56.699> is<00:00:56.910> texting<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:58.010> the<00:00:59.010> screen<00:00:59.430> is

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
for dialing is texting and the screen is

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:02.689 
for dialing is texting and the screen is
like<00:01:00.719> well<00:01:01.199> writing<00:01:02.010> on<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.160> screen<00:01:02.399> is<00:01:02.520> large

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
like well writing on the screen is large

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.649 
like well writing on the screen is large
so<00:01:03.120> that's<00:01:03.329> pretty<00:01:03.660> easy<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:04.439> read<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:05.659> the

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
so that's pretty easy to read and the

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.600 
so that's pretty easy to read and the
it's<00:01:07.020> sort<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:07.619> colored<00:01:07.799> orange<00:01:07.979> which<00:01:08.430> is

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
it's sort of colored orange which is

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.310 
it's sort of colored orange which is
apparently<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:09.030> most<00:01:09.299> easiest<00:01:09.780> colored<00:01:10.080> see

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
apparently the most easiest colored see

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.710 
apparently the most easiest colored see
if<00:01:10.560> you've<00:01:10.740> got<00:01:10.890> any<00:01:11.010> form<00:01:11.220> of<00:01:11.280> ID<00:01:11.520> theft

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720

if you've got any form of ID theft
including<00:01:12.720> short<00:01:12.930> sight<00:01:13.170> which<00:01:13.680> I<00:01:13.830> do<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.250> and

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
including short sight which I do and and

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.380 
including short sight which I do and and
and<00:01:16.200> it's<00:01:17.009> got<00:01:17.189> this<00:01:17.250> interesting<00:01:17.670> thing<00:01:18.270> of

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
and it's got this interesting thing of

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.770 
and it's got this interesting thing of
having<00:01:19.280> buttons<00:01:20.280> on<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.520> side<00:01:20.759> so<00:01:21.270> for

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
having buttons on the side so for

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.120 
having buttons on the side so for
example<00:01:21.840> if<00:01:22.290> you<00:01:22.439> want<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.710> flick<00:01:22.920> through

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
example if you want to flick through

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.249 
example if you want to flick through
many<00:01:23.610> options<00:01:24.060> instead<00:01:24.659> of<00:01:24.780> having<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:24.990> go

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
many options instead of having to go

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.539 
many options instead of having to go
through<00:01:25.530> different<00:01:25.799> things<00:01:26.189> on<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.400> home

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
through different things on the home

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:33.800 
through different things on the home
page<00:01:26.700> um<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:28.259> simply<00:01:28.860> that<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:32.360> yeah<00:01:33.360> seeing

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
page um you simply that and yeah seeing

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.350 
page um you simply that and yeah seeing
different<00:01:34.110> settings<00:01:34.530> call<00:01:35.130> info<00:01:35.640> phone<00:01:36.119> but

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
different settings call info phone but

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.999 
different settings call info phone but
and<00:01:36.570> so<00:01:37.200> it's<00:01:37.290> very<00:01:37.409> intuitive<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.979> use

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
and so it's very intuitive to use

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.679 
and so it's very intuitive to use
because<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:38.640> simply<00:01:38.790> just<00:01:38.970> like<00:01:39.390> straight

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
because you simply just like straight

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.929 
because you simply just like straight
side<00:01:39.990> of<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.170> phone<00:01:40.320> which<00:01:40.680> is<00:01:40.710> some<00:01:41.070> quite

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
side of the phone which is some quite

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.920 
side of the phone which is some quite
quite<00:01:42.509> straight<00:01:42.810> forward<00:01:42.840> movement<00:01:43.259> and

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
quite straight forward movement and

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.100 
quite straight forward movement and
downsize<00:01:45.930> well<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:47.299> do<00:01:48.299> you<00:01:48.450> cope<00:01:48.810> with<00:01:49.020> the

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
downsize well and do you cope with the

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.719 
downsize well and do you cope with the
phone<00:01:49.259> which<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:49.829> can't<00:01:50.159> leave<00:01:50.310> in<00:01:50.490> New<00:01:50.579> York

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729
