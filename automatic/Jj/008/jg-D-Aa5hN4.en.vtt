00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.609
 gregor schlierenzauer hearty 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.500
 Congrats on the victory number 43 and who 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.309
 Of course, 43 World Cup victories are also allowed 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.139
 to express a wish 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.840
 who he wants to be interviewed by 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.730
 best said both are exactly why 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:20.460
 There are no disputes of dispute 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:23.240
 mainz now with us or twice 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:29.150
 podium is on the weekend at the top and 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:33.420
 43 station also incredible what is he 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:35.250
 The stability is also enjoyable 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.410
 with which you have introduced yourself to the 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.180
 to go on tour 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.920
 well it's still up 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.840
 but of course it is analogue up 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.239
 the highest level likes the density 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.989
 For example, there are 11 of them today 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.640
 on 2 stood the one from 9 to 1 so one 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.820
 It's all a band you can see 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.850
 not afford to fail and therefore 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.020
 we were tense up and that was air 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.030
 gives our house to irritate 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.530
 Now I'll take it that way, yes I am 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.300
 like a santa claus as a matter 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.250
 Although I do not understand you 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.020
 as I always thought you put on value 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.640
 quality it should both that 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.320
 interview do here but it will 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.350
 Immediately have to say if you have to 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.350
 do 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.900
 with this experience of success now in the 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.610
 to go tournee all are like the 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.680
 Sparrows from the roofs whistle that who 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.810
 here in engelberg before the tour of 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.890
 is a real chance the 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.549
 win a tour 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.900
 that's all right last year 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.820
 better instructed as for example in 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.820
 your podium and then have all the tons 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.799
 So of course great motivation with 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.920
 a kick but that's why I do not care 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:46.979
 written what happens now 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.409
 Engelberg to Oberstdorf now happens 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.060
 once back to the hotel and drive home 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.640
 but exactly she did not want to 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:58.680
 his shares kexel measure that one 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:00.719
 strengthened what is ready pÃ©cs then eat 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.869
 Christmas tree decorate the Christ child 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:07.700
 wait to deliver the letter and so on 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.700
 eat fat of course yes 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:16.250
 you look like a fat whole the 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:18.020
 Bones so warriors before Christmas 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.870
 your family stays ahead of Christmas 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:23.209
 Fit stays healthy and then we'll see each other 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:27.380
 hopefully the empire will be back 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:28.250
 repulsed and but I know 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.959
 safe source 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.200
 German also be sung 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:35.200
