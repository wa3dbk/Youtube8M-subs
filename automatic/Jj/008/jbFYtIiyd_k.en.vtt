if<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.480> want<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.809> go<00:01:00.899> from<00:01:01.050> zero<00:01:01.500> so<00:01:01.910> let's<00:01:02.910> say

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
if you want to go from zero so let's say

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.179 
if you want to go from zero so let's say
eight<00:01:03.270> feet<00:01:03.570> you<00:01:03.780> would<00:01:03.870> need<00:01:04.019> about<00:01:04.260> 75<00:01:04.949> feet

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
eight feet you would need about 75 feet

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.760 
eight feet you would need about 75 feet
so<00:01:05.430> we<00:01:05.580> came<00:01:05.790> up<00:01:05.850> with<00:01:06.180> an<00:01:06.390> idea<00:01:06.540> that<00:01:07.500> we<00:01:07.650> would

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
so we came up with an idea that we would

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.090 
so we came up with an idea that we would
have<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.310> beach<00:01:08.610> entry<00:01:09.119> have<00:01:09.810> about<00:01:10.049> 18<00:01:10.530> feet<00:01:10.560> of

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
have a beach entry have about 18 feet of

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.830 
have a beach entry have about 18 feet of
beach<00:01:11.490> entry<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.000> then<00:01:12.090> have<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.299> set<00:01:12.540> of<00:01:12.630> steps

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
beach entry and then have a set of steps

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.020 
beach entry and then have a set of steps
to<00:01:13.020> get<00:01:13.140> down<00:01:13.320> into<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.650> shallow<00:01:13.890> end<00:01:14.130> so<00:01:14.850> it's

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
to get down into the shallow end so it's

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.649 
to get down into the shallow end so it's
a<00:01:15.119> custom<00:01:15.720> way<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:17.009> get<00:01:17.250> what<00:01:17.790> you<00:01:17.939> want<00:01:18.270> if<00:01:18.540> the

customer doesn't have a big enough yard

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.910
