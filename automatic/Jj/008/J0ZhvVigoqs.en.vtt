very cover and then using your fingers
you<00:02:59.090> could<00:02:59.240> push<00:02:59.450> it<00:02:59.480> back<00:02:59.720> on<00:02:59.900> and<00:03:00.350> there's<00:03:00.500> a

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
you could push it back on and there's a

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.040 
you could push it back on and there's a
different<00:03:00.830> clip<00:03:01.010> here<00:03:01.250> so<00:03:01.720> needs<00:03:02.720> a<00:03:02.810> bit<00:03:02.960> of

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
different clip here so needs a bit of

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.530 
different clip here so needs a bit of
wiggle<00:03:03.350> just<00:03:03.890> clip<00:03:04.580> the<00:03:04.670> two<00:03:04.850> bags<00:03:05.030> into<00:03:05.360> there

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
wiggle just clip the two bags into there

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.470 
wiggle just clip the two bags into there
and<00:03:05.780> then<00:03:06.740> what<00:03:06.980> I<00:03:07.010> do<00:03:07.130> is<00:03:07.370> I<00:03:07.460> put<00:03:07.640> my<00:03:07.790> hands

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
and then what I do is I put my hands

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.480 
and then what I do is I put my hands
behind<00:03:08.600> the<00:03:08.930> chain<00:03:09.110> case<00:03:09.380> on<00:03:10.070> these<00:03:10.220> no

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:10.490 
behind the chain case on these no

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.610 
behind the chain case on these no
problems<00:03:10.970> just<00:03:11.180> push<00:03:11.720> it<00:03:11.810> back<00:03:11.840> on<00:03:12.140> just<00:03:12.380> make

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
problems just push it back on just make

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.680 
problems just push it back on just make
sure<00:03:12.710> it<00:03:12.800> goes<00:03:12.890> nice<00:03:13.220> and<00:03:13.250> squarely<00:03:13.670> so<00:03:14.510> that's

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
sure it goes nice and squarely so that's

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.530 
sure it goes nice and squarely so that's
on<00:03:14.900> there<00:03:15.080> so<00:03:15.440> everything<00:03:15.800> back<00:03:16.070> together<00:03:16.250> and

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
on there so everything back together and

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.290 
on there so everything back together and
you<00:03:17.540> can<00:03:17.720> adjust<00:03:17.930> it
