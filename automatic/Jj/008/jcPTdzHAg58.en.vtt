00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.880
 party is very welcome to another 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.429
 We are here at the first video. 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.719
 video of assassin's creed and the nit galera 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.320
 then he decided to explain how I will 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.910
 do 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.880
 and we're not anywhere in the game 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.400
 we are not in front of the cathedral 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.109
 do not give me personal if you connect the status of the 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.570
 people are revolted with their 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.150
 politics they are burning mannequins 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.010
 they are making an attack revolt 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.900
 in the midst of the population did not 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.820
 a daring look in the eye of the water that 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.000
 only need to have a look at guards 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.360
 there marked and blue here protecting the 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.649
 cathedral of notre dame prince cathedral 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.480
 de notre dame main point of paris 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.649
 galileo graphic game quality a 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.899
 quantity of pcs 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.460
 the stuff is goofy and in that first 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.579
 video I'll show you how rubbish 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.890
 under the right cathedral as agent reveals 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.989
 the water point there is the point of view 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.090
 of this cathedral what it releases on the map 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.620
 and also that the map is already released 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.180
 because I've done it once but I think 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.040
 I can do it again right. 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.720
 the easiest point to go up is this 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.220
 here is the point that has a wide 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.750
 designed with a great mother with a 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.000
 strange symbol that you have as 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.840
 interact you go up here in front of the 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.340
 cathedral 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.110
 no guard will tv can stay 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.729
 quietly and personal plays while 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.920
 I get up from here and watch 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.689
 explaining how the series will work 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.220
 We are discussing in good channel you just have 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.840
 an idea is now nine in the morning already 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.850
 there were more than seven people posting 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.119
 Assassin's Creed Campaign Videos 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.130
 unit so I'm not going to campaign the 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.750
 I do not know if this is the 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.040
 best time to do is going to have a lot 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.140
 I do not know if I can deliver 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.240
 every episode of the series so I go 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.189
 to bring in all the remains of the 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.140
 game wants to deepen you in this game 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.970
 assassin's creed he has to 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.369
 feature and ubisoft leave a 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.079
 very full game very pretty much 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.149
 wonderful, is not it? 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.450
 I think the staff ends up in this thirst 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.490
 ckd to finish the game ends up taking a 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.979
 most of the immersion in the 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.390
 snow content so I want to bring this 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.890
 part of the immersion for you I want 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.570
 really bring something different to what 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.549
 you will not see on all channels and 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.259
 so you do not need to worry 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.959
 with spoiler also does not intend to bring 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:12.629
 nothing on the plot is this point here is 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.800
 very important is if you do not find this 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:16.410
 wood that perceived 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.360
 it is in the back of the cathedral 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.280
 will go around those bottlenecks 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.240
 airlines of agony are very 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.970
 famous people are very well represented 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.380
 here you saw it and here you go 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.480
 get to the cathedral ceiling 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.220
 Beauty will arrive by a tower and will 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.440
 make the area reveal in the other all 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.640
 good people then start talking me 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.560
 I intend to bring this kind of content 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.050
 differentiated and no choice for 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.910
 You can sometimes decide if you will. 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.290
 buy or not kill the curiosities of the 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.470
 game so I know it transmits 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.510
 content feel free to ask me 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.610
 ie part movie that thing says 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.080
 What does this show to me? 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.060
 always bring the maximum content to 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.760
 that you can have the maximum of the game and 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.960
 here is the synchronization point let's 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.610
 enjoy a little the landscape 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.410
 no one in the details late in each 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.360
 details of the work of your synchronized 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.550
 of the city and mainly of the cathedral 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.840
 because I think head from here in the city is 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.370
 more beautiful than at the time of the 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.260
 synchronism but anyway let's go let's go 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.280
 center and let's see what you 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.280
 Find out if you can 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:36.200
 how ugly, people are not good people then 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.819
 now let's make the leap of faith no 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.530
 talk about the architecture in style of 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:41.750
 architecture that you like, you should 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.189
 to have studied this is already there 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.489
 enough influence of architecture 

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:50.120
 I do not know if it 's really made with 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:53.299
 gothic culture is in the gothic style 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.349
 but anyway that's it, this exploitation I 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:55.939
 I want to know if you want sometimes. 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:58.069
 more historical data of things that 

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:59.989
 You will control this type of video I 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:01.730
 I do not think anyone does this today, I hope. 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:03.560
 I can bring you some 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.739
 things to explore the game is very 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:09.200
 complete to inject much way then 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:11.329
 I hope to get more and more to bring 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.950
 the maximum content way there for you 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:14.599
 since that revelation has left 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.469
 show what has been revealed here from the 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:17.150
 right map 

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:19.280
 as you can see there that gives a good 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.660
 revealed all over the paris map in the 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.300
 However, it has released some 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.470
 points here but specifically in it is 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.430
 that we made the revelation to people 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.440
 can release 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.550
 look look the structure of the noise has 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.580
 now it 's a fuck 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.780
 Look what the fuck is from the directors. 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.120
 that I have a goal to do there 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.729
 inside look what that old animal who 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:40.280
 animal fucking shit looks quality looks 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:42.229
 all the buildings in the area and such and here 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.270
 I did not reveal but here I already revealed then 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:46.340
 you can see the difference and in the texture 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.500
 not all the extras have to do here 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:51.500
 In this region all neighborhoods have to 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.389
 finally release thousands of things to 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.280
 make good people this is how we will have 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:57.050
 In this video I hope to bring many videos 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.060
 still with this coverage is thus 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.620

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.930
 escapes the style of differentiated coverage 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.880
 the patio is making staff very 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.680
