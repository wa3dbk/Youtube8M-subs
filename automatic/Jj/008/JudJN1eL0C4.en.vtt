00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.780 
so as we know there's more and more
terms<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.460> conditions<00:01:54.030> coming<00:01:54.570> on<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.810> belt

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
that well actually they keep adding more

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.410 
that well actually they keep adding more
and<00:02:03.899> more<00:02:03.990> things<00:02:04.350> now<00:02:04.649> this<00:02:05.549> one<00:02:05.850> I<00:02:05.880> like<00:02:06.180> the

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
and more things now this one I like the

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.270 
and more things now this one I like the
fact<00:02:06.659> that<00:02:06.750> it<00:02:07.049> does<00:02:07.409> have<00:02:07.439> a<00:02:07.680> power<00:02:07.920> button<00:02:08.250> on

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
fact that it does have a power button on

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.450 
fact that it does have a power button on
the<00:02:08.340> back<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:08.849> now<00:02:09.080> this<00:02:10.080> one<00:02:10.349> does<00:02:10.619> resemble

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
the back and now this one does resemble

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.770 
the back and now this one does resemble
a<00:02:11.490> lot<00:02:11.850> like<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.960> LG<00:02:13.370> g3<00:02:14.370> and<00:02:14.610> g4<00:02:14.880> because<00:02:15.660> they

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
a lot like the LG g3 and g4 because they

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.040 
a lot like the LG g3 and g4 because they
do<00:02:15.840> have<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.290> same<00:02:16.800> system<00:02:17.640> inside<00:02:18.450> as<00:02:18.840> you

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
do have the same system inside as you

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.890 
do have the same system inside as you
guys<00:02:19.260> can<00:02:19.530> see<00:02:19.890> it<00:02:20.220> is<00:02:20.730> working<00:02:21.060> we're<00:02:21.630> going

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
guys can see it is working we're going

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:28.300 
guys can see it is working we're going
to<00:02:21.990> focus<00:02:22.170> on<00:02:24.470> okay<00:02:25.470> so<00:02:25.620> it<00:02:25.980> is<00:02:26.010> working<00:02:26.760> really

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
to focus on okay so it is working really

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.560
