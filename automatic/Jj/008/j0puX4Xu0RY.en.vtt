one<00:00:30.990> of<00:00:31.080> my<00:00:31.199> videos<00:00:31.560> I<00:00:31.740> showed<00:00:32.009> you<00:00:32.189> guys<00:00:32.220> this

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:32.580 
one of my videos I showed you guys this

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.440 
one of my videos I showed you guys this
piping<00:00:32.970> but<00:00:33.150> um<00:00:33.860> anyway<00:00:34.860> what<00:00:35.040> I've<00:00:35.190> done<00:00:35.400> is<00:00:35.940> I

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
piping but um anyway what I've done is I

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.790 
piping but um anyway what I've done is I
mean<00:00:36.690> my<00:00:36.720> son<00:00:36.900> is<00:00:37.200> laying<00:00:37.380> on<00:00:37.560> the<00:00:37.680> other

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
mean my son is laying on the other

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.120 
mean my son is laying on the other
counts<00:00:38.190> anyway<00:00:38.910> I<00:00:39.150> drilled<00:00:40.110> holes<00:00:40.200> under<00:00:40.800> here

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:41.130 
counts anyway I drilled holes under here

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.310 
counts anyway I drilled holes under here
so<00:00:41.700> that<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.180> water<00:00:42.540> will<00:00:42.810> shoot<00:00:43.110> out<00:00:43.290> of

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
so that the water will shoot out of

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.400 
so that the water will shoot out of
those<00:00:43.710> holes<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:45.980> these<00:00:46.980> are<00:00:47.160> my<00:00:47.310> elbow

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
those holes and these are my elbow

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.840 
those holes and these are my elbow
connections<00:00:49.410> I<00:00:49.620> used<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:50.100> half<00:00:50.280> inch<00:00:50.580> PVC

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
connections I used a half inch PVC

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.560 
connections I used a half inch PVC
piping<00:00:51.570> I<00:00:51.780> got<00:00:52.380> from<00:00:52.680> Home<00:00:52.920> Depot<00:00:53.570> so

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
piping I got from Home Depot so

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.390 
piping I got from Home Depot so
everything<00:00:54.990> is<00:00:55.140> set<00:00:55.380> to<00:00:55.410> half-inch<00:00:55.980> because<00:00:56.280> I

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:56.400 
everything is set to half-inch because I

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.800 
everything is set to half-inch because I
was<00:00:56.550> easy<00:00:56.760> for<00:00:57.000> me<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.150> do<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.420> math<00:00:57.600> on

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:57.810 
was easy for me to do the math on

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.170 
was easy for me to do the math on
instead<00:00:58.200> of<00:00:58.260> like<00:00:58.470> 3/4<00:00:59.040> and<00:00:59.160> all<00:00:59.220> that<00:00:59.400> this<00:00:59.940> is

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
instead of like 3/4 and all that this is

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.620 
instead of like 3/4 and all that this is
my<00:01:00.950> shut<00:01:01.950> off<00:01:02.100> slowdown<00:01:02.880> valve<00:01:03.240> right<00:01:03.570> here

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:03.630 
my shut off slowdown valve right here

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.620 
my shut off slowdown valve right here
that<00:01:04.619> it's<00:01:05.460> going<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.700> be<00:01:05.820> easy<00:01:06.030> for<00:01:06.149> me<00:01:06.359> to<00:01:06.450> get

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
that it's going to be easy for me to get

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.120 
that it's going to be easy for me to get
to<00:01:06.840> because<00:01:06.960> it's<00:01:07.140> gonna<00:01:07.259> be<00:01:07.439> up<00:01:07.590> above<00:01:07.890> my

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
to because it's gonna be up above my

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.469 
to because it's gonna be up above my
grow<00:01:08.369> bed<00:01:08.609> and<00:01:10.159> follow<00:01:11.159> this<00:01:11.369> line<00:01:11.640> down<00:01:11.909> here

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
grow bed and follow this line down here

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.370 
grow bed and follow this line down here
and<00:01:13.729> here<00:01:14.729> my<00:01:14.850> Mitch<00:01:15.000> Mac<00:01:15.179> sucks<00:01:15.450> I<00:01:15.689> never<00:01:16.200> wear

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
and here my Mitch Mac sucks I never wear

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.660 
and here my Mitch Mac sucks I never wear
matching<00:01:16.530> socks<00:01:16.829> I<00:01:17.100> don't<00:01:17.280> see<00:01:17.399> the<00:01:17.490> point

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
matching socks I don't see the point

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.630 
matching socks I don't see the point
anyway<00:01:18.509> so<00:01:18.899> then<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.679> see<00:01:19.859> it<00:01:20.009> changes<00:01:20.460> up<00:01:20.609> to

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
anyway so then you see it changes up to

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.179 
anyway so then you see it changes up to
this<00:01:20.850> black<00:01:21.119> -<00:01:21.649> what<00:01:22.649> you<00:01:22.799> know<00:01:22.859> if<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.070> can

this black - what you know if you can
see<00:01:23.340> it<00:01:23.460> but<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:24.149> runs<00:01:24.240> along<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.929> this<00:01:25.890> nifty

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
see it but it runs along to this nifty

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.959 
see it but it runs along to this nifty
little<00:01:26.659> pumpy<00:01:27.659> thingy<00:01:28.039> alright<00:01:29.039> so<00:01:29.609> this<00:01:29.729> is

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:29.969 
little pumpy thingy alright so this is

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:32.899 
little pumpy thingy alright so this is
my<00:01:29.999> let<00:01:30.659> me<00:01:30.749> pull<00:01:30.990> back<00:01:31.170> this<00:01:31.799> is<00:01:32.009> my<00:01:32.159> pond<00:01:32.490> pump

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
my let me pull back this is my pond pump

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.620 
my let me pull back this is my pond pump
and<00:01:33.420> get<00:01:33.509> that<00:01:33.659> in<00:01:33.810> light<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.429> this<00:01:35.429> also<00:01:35.759> came

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
and get that in light and this also came

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.999 
and get that in light and this also came
with<00:01:36.689> a<00:01:37.259> little<00:01:37.710> slow<00:01:38.520> down<00:01:38.759> shutoff<00:01:39.450> valve<00:01:40.109> so

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
with a little slow down shutoff valve so

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.789 
with a little slow down shutoff valve so
I<00:01:41.039> don't<00:01:41.310> pump<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.880> water<00:01:42.119> too<00:01:42.420> fast<00:01:42.780> so<00:01:43.649> I<00:01:43.679> can

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
I don't pump the water too fast so I can

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.010 
I don't pump the water too fast so I can
sort<00:01:44.130> of<00:01:44.219> regulate<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:45.299> flow<00:01:45.450> of<00:01:45.569> the<00:01:45.780> water

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
sort of regulate the flow of the water

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.889 
sort of regulate the flow of the water
here<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:47.219> can<00:01:47.429> regulate<00:01:47.729> it<00:01:47.969> up<00:01:48.090> there<00:01:48.359> so

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
here and I can regulate it up there so

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.349 
here and I can regulate it up there so
that's<00:01:49.229> really<00:01:49.560> cool<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:50.100> this<00:01:50.729> is<00:01:50.999> again

00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:51.359 
that's really cool and this is again

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:56.199 
that's really cool and this is again
just<00:01:51.389> 1/2<00:01:51.990> inch<00:01:52.259> tubing<00:01:52.740> I<00:01:53.039> got<00:01:53.909> this<00:01:54.270> at

00:01:56.199 --> 00:01:56.209 
just 1/2 inch tubing I got this at

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:59.809 
just 1/2 inch tubing I got this at
Direct<00:01:57.209> at<00:01:57.329> uh<00:01:57.479> what's<00:01:57.899> it<00:01:58.020> called<00:01:58.490> Home<00:01:59.490> Depot

00:01:59.809 --> 00:01:59.819 
Direct at uh what's it called Home Depot

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:03.889 
Direct at uh what's it called Home Depot
again<00:02:00.209> I<00:02:00.450> think<00:02:00.810> this<00:02:01.560> pond<00:02:01.829> pump<00:02:02.159> was<00:02:02.659> $30<00:02:03.659> and

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
again I think this pond pump was $30 and

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.919 
again I think this pond pump was $30 and
I<00:02:04.409> bought<00:02:04.649> this<00:02:04.920> particular<00:02:05.159> pump<00:02:05.789> because<00:02:06.329> it

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:06.929 
I bought this particular pump because it

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:10.190 
I bought this particular pump because it
has<00:02:07.200> an<00:02:07.409> auto<00:02:07.709> shutoff<00:02:08.630> for<00:02:09.630> if<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.990> water

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
has an auto shutoff for if the water

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.320 
has an auto shutoff for if the water
level<00:02:10.350> gets<00:02:10.830> too<00:02:11.070> low<00:02:11.280> so<00:02:12.240> I<00:02:12.270> don't<00:02:12.720> know

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
level gets too low so I don't know

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.110 
level gets too low so I don't know
I<00:02:13.420> guess<00:02:14.040> it<00:02:15.040> would<00:02:15.190> have<00:02:15.280> to<00:02:15.340> get<00:02:15.520> really<00:02:15.940> low

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
I guess it would have to get really low

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.700 
I guess it would have to get really low
but<00:02:16.390> I<00:02:16.480> thought<00:02:16.660> an<00:02:16.840> auto-shutoff<00:02:17.290> would<00:02:17.620> be

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
but I thought an auto-shutoff would be

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.490 
but I thought an auto-shutoff would be
nice<00:02:17.920> but<00:02:18.820> they<00:02:19.240> had<00:02:19.450> more<00:02:19.720> expensive<00:02:20.260> ones

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
nice but they had more expensive ones

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.710 
nice but they had more expensive ones
and<00:02:20.800> they<00:02:20.860> even<00:02:21.070> had<00:02:21.280> cheaper<00:02:21.700> ones<00:02:21.910> but<00:02:22.570> that

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
and they even had cheaper ones but that

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.570 
and they even had cheaper ones but that
one<00:02:22.870> had<00:02:23.050> the<00:02:23.170> auto<00:02:23.350> shutoff<00:02:23.800> on<00:02:24.190> and<00:02:24.370> I<00:02:24.400> kind

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
one had the auto shutoff on and I kind

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.060 
one had the auto shutoff on and I kind
of<00:02:24.670> liked<00:02:24.820> that<00:02:24.970> component<00:02:25.390> of<00:02:25.690> it<00:02:25.900> so<00:02:26.740> what

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
of liked that component of it so what

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:28.710 
of liked that component of it so what
you'll<00:02:27.310> do<00:02:27.520> is<00:02:27.730> this<00:02:27.940> will<00:02:28.150> go<00:02:28.180> on<00:02:28.360> the<00:02:28.600> inside

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
you'll do is this will go on the inside

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.630 
you'll do is this will go on the inside
of<00:02:29.410> the<00:02:29.470> fish<00:02:29.680> tank<00:02:30.040> and<00:02:32.040> we'll<00:02:33.040> pump<00:02:33.460> the

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
of the fish tank and we'll pump the

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.110 
of the fish tank and we'll pump the
water<00:02:33.790> up<00:02:33.970> through<00:02:34.480> here<00:02:35.790> well<00:02:36.790> this<00:02:36.940> will<00:02:37.090> be

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
my control valve and then the water will

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.700
