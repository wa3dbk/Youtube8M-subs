I<00:01:21.030> believe<00:01:21.600> stormfly<00:01:22.200> is<00:01:22.409> usually<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:22.830> much

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
I believe stormfly is usually a much

I believe stormfly is usually a much
lighter<00:01:23.400> blue<00:01:23.850> like<00:01:24.600> we've<00:01:24.810> seen<00:01:25.110> in<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.500> past

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.770 
lighter blue like we've seen in the past
and<00:01:26.189> I'm<00:01:26.549> pretty<00:01:26.820> sure<00:01:26.909> I've<00:01:27.299> seen<00:01:27.600> this

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
and I'm pretty sure I've seen this

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.660 
and I'm pretty sure I've seen this

feature<00:02:17.150> this<00:02:17.450> is<00:02:17.510> never<00:02:18.140> worked<00:02:18.410> very<00:02:18.739> well

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
feature this is never worked very well

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.830 
feature this is never worked very well
but<00:02:19.519> just<00:02:19.580> makes<00:02:19.910> the<00:02:20.060> dragon<00:02:20.390> look<00:02:20.540> kind<00:02:20.750> of

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
but just makes the dragon look kind of

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.229 
but just makes the dragon look kind of
funky<00:02:21.290> so<00:02:22.069> if<00:02:22.220> there's<00:02:22.430> a<00:02:22.489> repaint<00:02:22.910> of<00:02:23.060> an

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
funky so if there's a repaint of an

funky so if there's a repaint of an
adder<00:02:23.420> this<00:02:23.750> is<00:02:23.959> the<00:02:24.050> one<00:02:24.200> you'd<00:02:24.410> want<00:02:24.440> she

Mabel those spikes on your tail or for
killing<00:02:54.170> bad<00:02:54.440> Vikings<00:02:55.069> not<00:02:55.400> good<00:02:55.760> Vikings

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.720 

onto<00:03:11.959> the<00:03:12.170> hideous<00:03:12.560> zippleback<00:03:12.739> in<00:03:13.519> the

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
onto the hideous zippleback in the

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.690 
onto the hideous zippleback in the
orange<00:03:14.150> rollin<00:03:14.750> flame<00:03:15.170> attack<00:03:15.739> and<00:03:16.040> this<00:03:16.459> is<00:03:16.670> a

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
orange rollin flame attack and this is a

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.039 
orange rollin flame attack and this is a
little<00:03:17.060> more<00:03:17.180> appropriate<00:03:17.540> than<00:03:17.989> the

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
little more appropriate than the

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:20.800 
little more appropriate than the
previous<00:03:18.709> green<00:03:19.250> rolling<00:03:20.090> zippleback

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
previous green rolling zippleback

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.020 
previous green rolling zippleback
because<00:03:21.500> when<00:03:22.069> they<00:03:22.250> are<00:03:22.370> in<00:03:22.489> this<00:03:22.639> attack

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
because when they are in this attack

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.420 
because when they are in this attack
mode<00:03:23.269> they<00:03:23.660> are<00:03:23.780> on<00:03:23.930> fire<00:03:24.260> and<00:03:24.319> extremely<00:03:25.220> hot

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
mode they are on fire and extremely hot

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.849 
mode they are on fire and extremely hot
so<00:03:25.670> it<00:03:26.090> makes<00:03:26.299> more<00:03:26.510> sense<00:03:26.569> to<00:03:27.109> be<00:03:27.260> a<00:03:27.290> bright

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:27.859 
so it makes more sense to be a bright

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:30.190 
so it makes more sense to be a bright
orange<00:03:28.430> it<00:03:28.910> is<00:03:29.060> nice<00:03:29.420> though<00:03:29.660> to<00:03:29.720> have<00:03:29.900> this

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
orange it is nice though to have this

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.319 
orange it is nice though to have this
version<00:03:30.440> maybe<00:03:30.829> just<00:03:31.549> before<00:03:31.910> he<00:03:32.090> gets

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:32.329 
version maybe just before he gets

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:37.030 
version maybe just before he gets
rolling<00:03:32.989> up<00:03:33.139> to<00:03:33.380> the<00:03:33.769> fire<00:03:34.459> stage<00:03:35.829> again<00:03:36.829> this

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
rolling up to the fire stage again this

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.009 
rolling up to the fire stage again this
is<00:03:37.190> a<00:03:37.220> repaint<00:03:37.639> so<00:03:37.850> it<00:03:37.940> pretty<00:03:38.150> much<00:03:38.299> does<00:03:38.660> the

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
is a repaint so it pretty much does the

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:41.140 
is a repaint so it pretty much does the
same<00:03:39.290> thing<00:03:39.590> there's<00:03:39.859> a<00:03:39.920> release<00:03:40.459> button<00:03:40.790> here

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
same thing there's a release button here

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.780 
same thing there's a release button here
on<00:03:41.299> his<00:03:41.540> side<00:03:41.840> which<00:03:42.170> will<00:03:42.350> pop<00:03:42.829> pop<00:03:43.160> his<00:03:43.430> heads

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
on his side which will pop pop his heads

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.150 
on his side which will pop pop his heads

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
are joints there I've always had trouble

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.040 
are joints there I've always had trouble
getting<00:04:54.630> him<00:04:55.080> into<00:04:56.240> somewhat<00:04:57.240> of<00:04:57.270> any<00:04:57.600> kind<00:04:57.930> of

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
getting him into somewhat of any kind of

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.590 
getting him into somewhat of any kind of
realistic<00:04:58.710> a<00:04:58.830> zippleback<00:04:59.040> look<00:04:59.700> but<00:05:00.330> it's

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
realistic a zippleback look but it's

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.540 
realistic a zippleback look but it's
been<00:05:00.990> kind<00:05:01.290> of<00:05:01.320> a<00:05:01.410> fun<00:05:01.590> dragon<00:05:01.800> to<00:05:02.010> play<00:05:02.190> with<00:05:02.370> I

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
been kind of a fun dragon to play with I

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.750 
been kind of a fun dragon to play with I
think<00:05:02.610> I<00:05:02.850> prefer<00:05:03.360> this<00:05:03.630> orange<00:05:04.080> version

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 
think I prefer this orange version

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.000 
think I prefer this orange version
versus<00:05:05.760> the<00:05:06.270> green<00:05:06.510> version<00:05:06.810> because<00:05:07.320> if<00:05:07.530> you

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010 
versus the green version because if you

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:09.650 
versus the green version because if you
want<00:05:08.310> a<00:05:08.430> green<00:05:08.670> version<00:05:08.880> you<00:05:09.210> might<00:05:09.360> as<00:05:09.540> well

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 
want a green version you might as well

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.170 
want a green version you might as well
just<00:05:09.900> go<00:05:10.080> with<00:05:10.290> a<00:05:10.500> regular<00:05:11.340> zippleback<00:05:11.730> and

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
just go with a regular zippleback and

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.270 
just go with a regular zippleback and
then<00:05:12.690> have<00:05:12.960> the<00:05:13.110> orange<00:05:13.380> version<00:05:13.890> for<00:05:14.130> the

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
then have the orange version for the

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.210 
then have the orange version for the
flaming<00:05:14.760> attack<00:05:15.270> so<00:05:16.170> that<00:05:16.350> is<00:05:16.500> a<00:05:16.530> quick<00:05:16.860> look
