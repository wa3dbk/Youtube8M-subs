isn't it let's talk about how they did
it<00:00:14.849> they<00:00:15.089> did<00:00:15.299> it<00:00:15.330> with<00:00:15.660> genetic<00:00:16.289> engineering

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
it they did it with genetic engineering

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.680 
it they did it with genetic engineering
in<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.130> house<00:00:17.279> of<00:00:17.520> fashioning<00:00:18.029> according<00:00:18.510> to

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.160 
the Sumerians in the house of fashioning
where<00:00:21.000> they<00:00:21.090> created<00:00:21.480> not<00:00:21.630> us<00:00:21.810> with<00:00:22.050> the

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
where they created not us with the

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.140 
where they created not us with the
domesticated<00:00:23.130> plants<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:23.580> animals<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:24.090> they

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
domesticated plants and animals and they

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.640 
domesticated plants and animals and they
go<00:00:24.300> over<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.539> process<00:00:24.720> and<00:00:25.170> it's<00:00:25.260> very<00:00:25.470> long

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
go over the process and it's very long

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:26.900 
go over the process and it's very long
and<00:00:25.830> it's<00:00:25.920> very<00:00:25.980> detailed<00:00:26.279> and<00:00:26.640> they<00:00:26.730> make<00:00:26.880> a

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
and it's very detailed and they make a

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
lot of mistakes it's not easy for them

something like us you know dolly the
clone<00:00:35.430> we<00:00:35.640> saw<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:35.910> trouble<00:00:36.420> that<00:00:36.450> they<00:00:36.660> had

clone we saw the trouble that they had
with<00:00:36.989> that<00:00:37.020> it's<00:00:37.620> not<00:00:37.770> that<00:00:37.980> easy<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.280> make<00:00:38.399> a

made a lot of mistakes had a lot of
false<00:00:43.079> alarms<00:00:43.590> but<00:00:43.920> they<00:00:44.219> eventually<00:00:44.370> did<00:00:45.120> it

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
false alarms but they eventually did it

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.979 
false alarms but they eventually did it
if<00:00:46.129> ok<00:00:47.129> with<00:00:47.370> us<00:00:47.610> as<00:00:47.910> I<00:00:48.300> said<00:00:48.329> they<00:00:48.780> were<00:00:48.809> making

a<00:00:49.170> lot<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.350> mistakes<00:00:49.469> but<00:00:50.309> they<00:00:50.489> were<00:00:50.550> making<00:00:51.030> a

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
a lot of mistakes but they were making a

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.610 
a lot of mistakes but they were making a
slave<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.629> they<00:00:51.690> had<00:00:51.809> a<00:00:51.840> deadline<00:00:52.110> they<00:00:52.440> had<00:00:52.590> a

how would that get in the gene pool how

making a slave what do they care if they

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
kill one in a hundred what did they care

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.940 
kill one in a hundred what did they care
if<00:02:38.130> they<00:02:38.250> kill<00:02:38.489> one<00:02:38.730> in<00:02:38.850> ten<00:02:39.590> as<00:02:40.590> long<00:02:40.860> as

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
if they kill one in ten as long as

if they kill one in ten as long as
they've<00:02:41.040> got<00:02:41.070> some<00:02:41.520> coming<00:02:41.880> out<00:02:42.030> that<00:02:42.239> work

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
they've got some coming out that work

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.630 
they've got some coming out that work
right<00:02:42.750> and<00:02:43.290> they<00:02:43.739> knew<00:02:43.920> they<00:02:44.070> would<00:02:44.310> because

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
right and they knew they would because

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.510 
right and they knew they would because
they<00:02:44.760> knew<00:02:44.910> the<00:02:45.030> numbers<00:02:45.330> game<00:02:45.540> here<00:02:46.520> okay

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
they knew the numbers game here okay

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:54.710 
they knew the numbers game here okay
next<00:02:47.730> slide<00:02:50.480> okay<00:02:51.480> this<00:02:52.200> is<00:02:53.150> really<00:02:54.150> amazing

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
next slide okay this is really amazing

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.780 
next slide okay this is really amazing
to<00:02:55.140> me<00:02:55.260> it<00:02:55.470> is<00:02:55.590> a<00:02:55.620> comparison<00:02:56.010> of<00:02:56.370> human

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
to me it is a comparison of human

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.970 
to me it is a comparison of human
chimpanzee<00:02:57.510> gorilla<00:02:58.200> and<00:02:58.380> orangutan

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
chimpanzee gorilla and orangutan

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.710 
chimpanzee gorilla and orangutan
chromosomes<00:02:59.730> and<00:02:59.880> you<00:02:59.970> see<00:03:00.150> how<00:03:00.300> really

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
chromosomes and you see how really

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.360 
chromosomes and you see how really
similar<00:03:00.989> there<00:03:01.320> and<00:03:01.650> you<00:03:01.769> always<00:03:02.070> hear<00:03:02.340> about

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
similar there and you always hear about

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.060 
similar there and you always hear about
how<00:03:02.760> similar<00:03:03.150> we<00:03:03.330> are<00:03:03.600> you<00:03:04.380> know<00:03:04.500> ninety<00:03:04.830> five

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
how similar we are you know ninety five

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.880 
how similar we are you know ninety five
percent<00:03:05.310> 90<00:03:06.060> percent<00:03:06.090> sharing<00:03:07.050> the<00:03:07.140> DNA<00:03:07.650> and

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
percent 90 percent sharing the DNA and

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.160 
percent 90 percent sharing the DNA and
all<00:03:08.010> so<00:03:08.610> it<00:03:08.700> really<00:03:09.239> makes<00:03:09.480> it<00:03:09.630> look<00:03:09.840> like<00:03:09.870> it

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
all so it really makes it look like it

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.820 
all so it really makes it look like it
really<00:03:10.620> makes<00:03:11.010> it<00:03:11.190> look<00:03:11.400> like<00:03:11.430> we<00:03:12.120> descended

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
really makes it look like we descended

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.280 
really makes it look like we descended
from<00:03:13.830> them<00:03:14.330> but<00:03:15.330> they<00:03:15.450> don't<00:03:15.600> mention<00:03:15.840> that<00:03:16.170> we

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
from them but they don't mention that we

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.020 
from them but they don't mention that we
share<00:03:16.530> about<00:03:16.769> 50<00:03:17.100> percent<00:03:17.250> you'd<00:03:17.760> be<00:03:17.880> looking

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
share about 50 percent you'd be looking

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.240 
share about 50 percent you'd be looking
at<00:03:18.269> a<00:03:18.330> lot<00:03:18.840> of<00:03:18.959> similarity<00:03:19.500> with<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:19.680> mouse<00:03:19.980> up

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
at a lot of similarity with the mouse up

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.400 
at a lot of similarity with the mouse up
there<00:03:22.160> it's<00:03:23.160> amazing<00:03:23.880> it's<00:03:24.720> amazing<00:03:24.870> how<00:03:25.350> you

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
there it's amazing it's amazing how you

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.800 
there it's amazing it's amazing how you
can<00:03:25.500> be<00:03:25.709> fooled<00:03:26.010> by<00:03:26.220> these<00:03:26.459> things<00:03:26.670> but<00:03:27.299> let's

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
can be fooled by these things but let's

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.240 
can be fooled by these things but let's
talk<00:03:28.079> for<00:03:28.350> a<00:03:28.380> minute<00:03:28.530> about<00:03:28.709> what<00:03:29.070> the

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
talk for a minute about what the

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.220 
talk for a minute about what the
Anunnaki<00:03:30.090> were<00:03:30.329> up<00:03:30.480> against<00:03:30.870> when<00:03:31.049> they

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
Anunnaki were up against when they

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.920 
Anunnaki were up against when they
wanted<00:03:31.560> to<00:03:31.620> create<00:03:32.160> us<00:03:32.489> when<00:03:33.480> they<00:03:33.600> wanted<00:03:33.870> to

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
wanted to create us when they wanted to

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.410 
wanted to create us when they wanted to
create<00:03:34.440> a<00:03:34.799> creature<00:03:35.489> in<00:03:35.820> their<00:03:36.030> own<00:03:36.150> image

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
create a creature in their own image

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.300 
create a creature in their own image
after<00:03:36.720> their<00:03:36.900> own<00:03:37.019> likeness<00:03:37.260> and<00:03:37.620> they<00:03:38.010> said

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
after their own likeness and they said

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.160 
after their own likeness and they said
well<00:03:38.549> okay<00:03:38.910> we're<00:03:39.269> not<00:03:39.420> really<00:03:39.750> well<00:03:40.019> adapted

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
well okay we're not really well adapted

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.830 
well okay we're not really well adapted
to<00:03:40.650> earth<00:03:40.950> and<00:03:41.850> we<00:03:42.000> know<00:03:42.120> that<00:03:42.299> because<00:03:42.480> in<00:03:42.750> the

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
to earth and we know that because in the

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.390 
to earth and we know that because in the
cylinder<00:03:43.260> seals<00:03:43.500> they're<00:03:43.709> always<00:03:43.890> shown<00:03:44.250> as

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
cylinder seals they're always shown as

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.819 
cylinder seals they're always shown as
you<00:03:44.519> saw<00:03:44.730> those<00:03:44.940> gods<00:03:45.209> fully<00:03:46.140> dressed<00:03:46.500> fully

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
you saw those gods fully dressed fully

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:48.740 
you saw those gods fully dressed fully
clothed<00:03:47.190> with<00:03:47.579> things<00:03:47.850> on<00:03:48.030> their<00:03:48.180> heads<00:03:48.420> and

clothed with things on their heads and

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.660 
clothed with things on their heads and
the<00:03:49.410> humans<00:03:49.829> are<00:03:49.980> standing<00:03:50.400> there<00:03:50.549> you<00:03:50.640> know

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
the humans are standing there you know

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.340 
the humans are standing there you know
maybe<00:03:50.910> an<00:03:51.090> alluring<00:03:51.299> cloth<00:03:51.570> or<00:03:51.810> naked<00:03:52.230> the

maybe an alluring cloth or naked the
humans<00:03:52.709> are<00:03:52.860> better<00:03:53.579> adapted<00:03:53.790> to<00:03:54.299> the<00:03:54.390> planet

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
humans are better adapted to the planet

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.090 
humans are better adapted to the planet
than<00:03:54.870> they<00:03:54.989> are<00:03:55.110> so<00:03:55.500> they<00:03:55.590> said<00:03:55.769> okay<00:03:55.950> we're

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
than they are so they said okay we're

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.009 
than they are so they said okay we're
not<00:03:56.220> really<00:03:56.459> well<00:03:56.670> adapted<00:03:56.790> let's<00:03:57.480> take<00:03:57.750> some

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
not really well adapted let's take some

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.620 
not really well adapted let's take some
genes<00:03:58.380> from<00:03:58.799> the<00:03:59.220> creatures<00:03:59.940> of<00:03:59.970> Earth<00:04:00.329> and

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
genes from the creatures of Earth and

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.090 
genes from the creatures of Earth and
they<00:04:00.690> say<00:04:00.870> that<00:04:01.049> we<00:04:01.170> shall<00:04:01.380> build<00:04:01.590> them<00:04:01.860> take

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
they say that we shall build them take

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.370 
they say that we shall build them take
some<00:04:02.400> of<00:04:02.519> the<00:04:02.579> creatures<00:04:02.910> of<00:04:02.940> Earth<00:04:03.239> and<00:04:03.570> and

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
some of the creatures of Earth and and

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.890 
some of the creatures of Earth and and
use<00:04:04.709> it<00:04:04.860> as<00:04:04.980> a<00:04:05.010> model<00:04:05.459> so<00:04:06.299> let's<00:04:06.510> assume<00:04:06.840> that

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
use it as a model so let's assume that

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.009 
use it as a model so let's assume that
using<00:04:07.470> all<00:04:07.620> like<00:04:07.920> Zayas<00:04:08.489> anna<00:04:08.730> and<00:04:09.060> so<00:04:09.870> we've

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
using all like Zayas anna and so we've

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:12.259 
using all like Zayas anna and so we've
got<00:04:10.170> some<00:04:10.230> of<00:04:10.709> her<00:04:10.950> genes<00:04:11.280> but<00:04:11.579> mostly<00:04:12.030> we're

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
got some of her genes but mostly we're

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:12.960 
got some of her genes but mostly we're
going<00:04:12.449> to<00:04:12.510> have

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
going to have

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.420 
going to have
their<00:04:13.450> genes<00:04:13.720> where<00:04:14.200> they<00:04:14.470> want<00:04:14.860> us<00:04:15.070> to<00:04:15.100> be

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
their genes where they want us to be

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.780 
their genes where they want us to be
like<00:04:15.460> them<00:04:16.530> but<00:04:17.530> they've<00:04:17.829> got<00:04:18.040> a<00:04:18.070> problem<00:04:18.640> and

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:18.790 
like them but they've got a problem and

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:20.910 
like them but they've got a problem and
it's<00:04:18.910> a<00:04:19.000> big<00:04:19.209> one<00:04:19.239> because<00:04:19.540> they<00:04:20.049> themselves

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:20.920 
it's a big one because they themselves

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:26.220 
it's a big one because they themselves
must<00:04:21.910> have<00:04:22.240> must<00:04:23.110> have<00:04:23.280> 46<00:04:24.280> chromosomes<00:04:25.230> why

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
must have must have 46 chromosomes why

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:29.130 
must have must have 46 chromosomes why
because<00:04:26.830> we<00:04:27.100> among<00:04:27.700> primates<00:04:28.240> alone<00:04:28.810> among

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140 
because we among primates alone among

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.940 
because we among primates alone among
primates<00:04:29.590> have<00:04:30.130> 46<00:04:30.610> chromosomes<00:04:31.030> and<00:04:31.680> so<00:04:32.680> when

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
primates have 46 chromosomes and so when

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.010 
primates have 46 chromosomes and so when
they<00:04:33.100> start<00:04:33.430> with<00:04:33.610> the<00:04:33.760> AMA<00:04:33.970> they've<00:04:34.690> got<00:04:34.990> a

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
they start with the AMA they've got a

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.200 
they start with the AMA they've got a
creature<00:04:35.350> with<00:04:35.590> 48<00:04:36.040> chromosomes<00:04:36.460> because<00:04:37.030> all

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
creature with 48 chromosomes because all

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.850 
creature with 48 chromosomes because all
the<00:04:37.420> primates<00:04:37.840> on<00:04:38.020> earth<00:04:38.170> have<00:04:38.410> 48

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
the primates on earth have 48

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.740 
the primates on earth have 48
chromosomes<00:04:39.220> so<00:04:39.700> you<00:04:39.760> got<00:04:39.880> 48<00:04:40.270> chromosomes

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
chromosomes so you got 48 chromosomes

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.930 
chromosomes so you got 48 chromosomes
here<00:04:41.290> and<00:04:41.500> you're<00:04:41.890> the<00:04:42.040> Anunnaki<00:04:42.490> and<00:04:42.730> you<00:04:42.790> got

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
here and you're the Anunnaki and you got

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.970 
here and you're the Anunnaki and you got
46<00:04:43.480> how<00:04:44.050> are<00:04:44.230> you<00:04:44.380> going<00:04:44.530> to<00:04:44.620> put<00:04:44.830> this

46 how are you going to put this

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:45.660 
46 how are you going to put this
together

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:45.670

the same creature and it's just too much

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.090 
only one way to solve this problem you

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:24.720 
only one way to solve this problem you
have<00:05:22.240> to<00:05:22.360> take<00:05:22.570> the<00:05:22.750> 48<00:05:23.410> chromosome<00:05:24.310> the<00:05:24.580> one

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:24.730 
have to take the 48 chromosome the one

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:28.050 
have to take the 48 chromosome the one
with<00:05:24.850> the<00:05:24.940> 48<00:05:25.390> chromosomes<00:05:25.780> and<00:05:26.700> you<00:05:27.700> have<00:05:27.910> to

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
with the 48 chromosomes and you have to

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.170 
with the 48 chromosomes and you have to
fuse<00:05:28.450> two<00:05:28.810> of<00:05:28.990> them<00:05:29.200> together<00:05:29.850> so<00:05:30.850> that<00:05:30.880> they

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.180 
fuse two of them together so that they

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.350 
fuse two of them together so that they
only<00:05:31.450> take<00:05:31.780> up<00:05:31.990> one<00:05:32.290> space<00:05:32.890> and<00:05:33.400> now<00:05:34.060> you've

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 
only take up one space and now you've

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:35.670 
only take up one space and now you've
got<00:05:34.600> even<00:05:34.780> though<00:05:34.960> you've<00:05:35.140> got<00:05:35.169> 48

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 
got even though you've got 48

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.890 
got even though you've got 48
chromosomes<00:05:36.070> it's<00:05:36.430> taken<00:05:36.760> up<00:05:36.880> one<00:05:37.240> space<00:05:37.630> and

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:37.900 
chromosomes it's taken up one space and
