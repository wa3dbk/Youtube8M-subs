00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:11.430
 in colorimetry there are three modes 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.740
 main colors the light like 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.990
 the screens the colors of the material 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.480
 like inks and the third is 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.000
 used in monochrome is the level 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.519
 of gray the color of the light that 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.369
 bears the name of rvb for the colors 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:30.029
 primary red green blue pose problem 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.710
 to reproduce with cmjn inks this is 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:36.089
 to say the four primary colors 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:38.580
 cyan magenta yellow and black on this 

00:00:36.089 --> 00:00:41.460
 example with photoshop I wanted you 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.830
 show the differences between r &amp; b and 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.600
 the cmj yens we find that 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.670
 turquoises are the most difficult to 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.159
 reproduce top right of your screen 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.650
 dark blue turns into blue 

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:54.180
 almost violated 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.309
 that's why sometimes you have to go 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.089
 by professional software for 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:02.100
 edit images simulating the cmjn of 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:05.479
 way to retouch them to have a 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.479
 better result when printing 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.840
 a sepia image is not black and 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.360
 White 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.610
 you have to convert it to grayscale 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.340
 for the printer to be able to use 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.890
 only black inked but know 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.780
 that a simple conversion is sometimes 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.540
 not enough you have to do some 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.420
 settings for the contrast so on the 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.750
 paper a black and an intense white of 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.480
 noront depth to your image 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:39.390
 it is necessary to use tools 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:42.860
 image editing software concerning 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.860
 the tale the contrast the brightness 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.760
 for internet resolution is a real 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.640
 trap could use the images 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.420
 for printing 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.880
 beware of the rights 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.880
 of authorship if the image appears any 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.820
 small on the screen zoom in to see 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.090
 if it is in high definition 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:09.890
 most of the time this is not the case 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.340
 also look at its weight the weight of 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.770
 file 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.630
 it's an image made less than 1 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.430
 megabyte 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.920
 it's often already a sign that she 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:22.370
 is not good enough for 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:26.060
 printing with appropriate software 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:29.000
 ensure its size and resolution 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:33.459
 for example an image of 10 cm wide 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.990
 at 300 pixels per inch and the minimum 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:38.300
 sometimes to better realize it 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:41.690
 test your image by printing large 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.800
 you will see from the resolution and the 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.290
 sharpness is not necessarily at the rendezvous 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.780
 I strongly advise against it 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.790
 for an impression either where art 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.990
 scanner either you buy an image in 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.020
 best quality 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:58.080
 wide margins allow for 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:00.480
 aeration of your layout be you 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:03.990
 make them equal outside and 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.240
 inside the pages be wider at 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:08.880
 the outside what is useful for 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.950
 position pushes the reading or 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.210
 gap of notes 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:15.870
 either you make it wider at the level of 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:18.540
 the binding the trick is to check in 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.920
 you're relying on the page number the 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.830
 pages a father is always at 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.300
 right in a book it can be a 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.400
 indication if you wish to make a 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:29.100
 wider margin inside or 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.930
 outside of the page 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.200
 the trap is not to configure your 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:38.310
 layout software vis-Ã -vis or 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:40.050
 in book mode therefore the margin the 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.320
 wider are always the same 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.320
 side 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:50.750
 do not forget to print make 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:53.340
 benchmarks to control your work 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:56.480
 thank you for joining us for very 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.480
 soon for a next video
