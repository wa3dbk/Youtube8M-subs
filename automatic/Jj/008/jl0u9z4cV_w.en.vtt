 hello to you senate and today I 

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:17.210
 I write down the guide for setting up the gamepad for 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:20.360
 fifa 2014 pirated version i assure you 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:23.860
 This setup method must pay for 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:28.630
 pirated versions but there is one catch 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:33.340
 right stick will not work 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:37.360
 will only be on a gamepad like x-box 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:39.610
 360 and so you need to make you 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.769
 will need to download the utility which i 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.050

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:51.579

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.079
 to customize the sticks you need to go 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:13.090

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:16.270
