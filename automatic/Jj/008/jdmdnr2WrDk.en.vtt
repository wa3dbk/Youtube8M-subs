00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.800 
the boxes open property editor came to
master<00:03:04.260> one<00:03:04.530> and<00:03:05.480> bounding<00:03:06.480> box<00:03:08.420> okay<00:03:09.420> now<00:03:09.750> for

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
master one and bounding box okay now for

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.140 
master one and bounding box okay now for
the<00:03:10.230> car<00:03:11.150> change<00:03:12.150> it<00:03:12.390> to<00:03:12.739> mass<00:03:13.739> of<00:03:14.150> anything

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
the car change it to mass of anything

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.570 
the car change it to mass of anything
above<00:03:15.450> zero<00:03:15.870> IRS<00:03:16.410> changes<00:03:16.709> to<00:03:16.830> 50<00:03:17.250> for<00:03:17.459> this

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
above zero IRS changes to 50 for this

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:24.550 
above zero IRS changes to 50 for this
and<00:03:18.560> unyielding<00:03:19.560> and<00:03:20.390> bounding<00:03:21.390> box

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.240 

I<00:03:24.650> think<00:03:25.400> that's<00:03:25.670> good<00:03:26.410> ok

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
I think that's good ok

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.600 
I think that's good ok
so

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
so

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.130 
so
now<00:03:32.270> you're<00:03:32.450> wondering<00:03:32.750> how<00:03:32.840> we're<00:03:32.990> going<00:03:33.080> to

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
now you're wondering how we're going to

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.850 
now you're wondering how we're going to
make<00:03:33.260> the<00:03:33.410> car<00:03:33.590> go<00:03:34.540> okay<00:03:35.540> so<00:03:35.650> what<00:03:36.650> we're<00:03:36.770> going

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
make the car go okay so what we're going

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.550 
make the car go okay so what we're going
to<00:03:36.950> do<00:03:37.040> is<00:03:37.780> we're<00:03:38.780> if<00:03:39.050> you<00:03:39.200> know<00:03:39.320> anything

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
to do is we're if you know anything

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.620 
to do is we're if you know anything
about<00:03:39.650> of<00:03:40.010> K<00:03:40.160> you<00:03:40.220> don't<00:03:40.460> understand<00:03:40.850> this<00:03:41.060> if

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
about of K you don't understand this if

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.330 
about of K you don't understand this if
you<00:03:41.780> don't<00:03:42.020> this<00:03:42.350> good<00:03:42.770> way<00:03:42.890> to<00:03:42.950> learn<00:03:43.130> it

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
you don't this good way to learn it

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.410 
you don't this good way to learn it
click<00:03:44.270> here<00:03:44.510> it<00:03:44.600> says<00:03:44.750> auto<00:03:45.020> key<00:03:45.550> and<00:03:46.550> this

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
click here it says auto key and this

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.000 
click here it says auto key and this
turns<00:03:47.720> red<00:03:49.060> okay<00:03:50.060> so<00:03:51.020> wrong<00:03:51.320> zero<00:03:51.710> right<00:03:51.860> now

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
turns red okay so wrong zero right now

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.250 
turns red okay so wrong zero right now
so<00:03:52.220> we're<00:03:52.310> going<00:03:52.400> to<00:03:52.490> keys<00:03:52.760> zero<00:03:53.120> so<00:03:53.990> I<00:03:54.050> means

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
so we're going to keys zero so I means

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.220 
so we're going to keys zero so I means
at<00:03:54.380> zero<00:03:54.740> it'll<00:03:55.280> be<00:03:55.400> in<00:03:55.490> this<00:03:55.610> position<00:03:56.230> then

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
at zero it'll be in this position then

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:03.280 
at zero it'll be in this position then
at<00:03:58.390> see<00:03:59.650> right<00:04:00.650> here<00:04:01.310> look<00:04:01.790> oh<00:04:02.390> wait<00:04:02.840> my<00:04:03.050> bad

at see right here look oh wait my bad
oops<00:04:04.160> yeah<00:04:05.090> changes<00:04:05.660> here<00:04:05.840> about<00:04:06.220> ten<00:04:07.270> also

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:08.270 
oops yeah changes here about ten also

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:12.490 
oops yeah changes here about ten also
and<00:04:09.520> 57<00:04:10.520> in<00:04:11.030> the<00:04:11.150> middle<00:04:11.360> get<00:04:12.140> about<00:04:12.320> right

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
and 57 in the middle get about right

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.539 
and 57 in the middle get about right
here<00:04:12.940> say<00:04:13.940> just<00:04:14.180> made<00:04:14.330> a<00:04:14.360> key<00:04:14.570> by<00:04:14.720> itself

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:15.549 
here say just made a key by itself

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:18.120 
here say just made a key by itself
position<00:04:16.549> key<00:04:16.730> no<00:04:17.150> change<00:04:17.540> the<00:04:17.750> rotation

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
position key no change the rotation

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.800 
position key no change the rotation
which<00:04:19.130> is<00:04:19.250> the<00:04:19.370> green<00:04:19.609> one<00:04:19.790> we're<00:04:20.570> gonna<00:04:20.690> try

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
which is the green one we're gonna try

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.140 
which is the green one we're gonna try
to<00:04:20.870> make<00:04:20.900> a<00:04:21.019> look<00:04:21.169> at<00:04:21.230> the<00:04:21.290> car<00:04:21.470> spins<00:04:21.769> out<00:04:22.150> okay

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
to make a look at the car spins out okay

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.370 
to make a look at the car spins out okay
so<00:04:23.990> this<00:04:24.410> is<00:04:24.590> what<00:04:24.680> we<00:04:24.800> get<00:04:24.919> to<00:04:25.070> one<00:04:26.050> and<00:04:27.050> we'll

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
so this is what we get to one and we'll

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:34.060 
so this is what we get to one and we'll
get<00:04:28.100> to<00:04:28.690> 15<00:04:30.100> spin<00:04:31.100> it<00:04:31.130> like<00:04:31.220> this<00:04:31.550> and<00:04:32.890> drag<00:04:33.890> it

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
get to 15 spin it like this and drag it

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.340 
get to 15 spin it like this and drag it
up<00:04:34.220> here<00:04:34.640> and<00:04:34.790> hit<00:04:35.090> the<00:04:35.270> boxes<00:04:35.780> will<00:04:35.990> also<00:04:36.229> move

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
up here and hit the boxes will also move

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.690 
up here and hit the boxes will also move
it<00:04:36.500> back<00:04:36.650> a<00:04:36.680> little<00:04:36.830> bit<00:04:38.200> okay<00:04:39.200> so<00:04:39.260> this<00:04:39.620> is<00:04:39.830> our

people<00:05:08.810> change<00:05:08.960> I<00:05:09.380> don't<00:05:09.650> and<00:05:10.390> see<00:05:11.390> preview<00:05:12.020> in

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
people change I don't and see preview in

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.990 
people change I don't and see preview in
one<00:05:12.260> knew

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.740 

again<00:05:16.690> I<00:05:16.720> worked<00:05:17.050> out<00:05:17.230> pretty<00:05:17.350> good<00:05:17.530> I<00:05:18.600> just<00:05:19.600> in

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
again I worked out pretty good I just in

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:20.820 
again I worked out pretty good I just in
case<00:05:19.900> you<00:05:20.020> guys<00:05:20.110> didn't<00:05:20.380> see<00:05:20.500> that<00:05:20.530> I'll

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830 
case you guys didn't see that I'll

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.360 
case you guys didn't see that I'll
render<00:05:21.280> it<00:05:21.750> so<00:05:22.750> once<00:05:23.410> you<00:05:23.680> have<00:05:23.710> the<00:05:24.010> animation

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
render it so once you have the animation

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.940 
render it so once you have the animation
you<00:05:24.460> want<00:05:24.930> change<00:05:25.930> the<00:05:26.110> frames<00:05:26.380> you<00:05:26.650> want<00:05:26.830> to

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:26.950 
you want change the frames you want to

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:28.920 
you want change the frames you want to
start<00:05:27.190> out<00:05:27.370> you<00:05:27.490> can<00:05:27.640> make<00:05:27.760> it<00:05:27.880> start<00:05:28.150> in<00:05:28.360> the

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:28.930 
start out you can make it start in the

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.320 
start out you can make it start in the
middle<00:05:29.080> rate<00:05:29.950> when<00:05:30.190> it<00:05:30.280> crashes<00:05:30.520> it<00:05:31.000> you<00:05:31.210> know

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.330 
middle rate when it crashes it you know

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.330 
middle rate when it crashes it you know
it's<00:05:32.080> good<00:05:32.350> for<00:05:32.530> when<00:05:32.710> you<00:05:32.770> try<00:05:32.920> have<00:05:33.070> stuff

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:33.340 
it's good for when you try have stuff

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.760 
it's good for when you try have stuff
stay<00:05:33.670> in<00:05:33.820> place<00:05:34.090> until<00:05:35.130> a<00:05:36.130> certain<00:05:36.340> time<00:05:36.520> so

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 
stay in place until a certain time so

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.040 
stay in place until a certain time so
the<00:05:38.770> word<00:05:38.950> canít<00:05:39.190> started<00:05:39.520> 0<00:05:39.820> and<00:05:40.720> we're<00:05:40.900> going

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050
