00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470 
it has a leaking pivot pin it leaks them

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.030 
it has a leaking pivot pin it leaks them
right<00:00:30.710> here<00:00:31.540> and<00:00:32.540> the<00:00:33.410> only<00:00:33.559> way<00:00:33.710> to<00:00:33.769> tighten

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.040 
right here and the only way to tighten

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.619 
right here and the only way to tighten
that<00:00:34.280> is<00:00:34.460> from<00:00:34.699> behind<00:00:35.000> there's<00:00:35.330> supposed<00:00:35.570> to

00:00:35.619 --> 00:00:35.629 
that is from behind there's supposed to

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:37.540 
that is from behind there's supposed to

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
be a crown nut on it and you can tighten

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.520 
be a crown nut on it and you can tighten
it<00:00:37.640> from<00:00:37.790> behind<00:00:38.090> some<00:00:38.870> people<00:00:39.140> say<00:00:41.410> if<00:00:42.410> you're

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
it from behind some people say if you're

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.070 
it from behind some people say if you're
going<00:00:42.769> through<00:00:42.949> the<00:00:43.040> PTO<00:00:43.400> access<00:00:44.000> hole<00:00:44.300> you

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:45.080 
going through the PTO access hole you

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.640 
going through the PTO access hole you
could<00:00:45.229> reach<00:00:45.440> in<00:00:45.680> there<00:00:45.830> and<00:00:45.860> get<00:00:46.190> it<00:00:46.370> but<00:00:47.650> I'm

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:48.650 
could reach in there and get it but I'm

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.329 
could reach in there and get it but I'm
not<00:00:49.780> buying<00:00:50.780> that<00:00:51.110> and<00:00:51.409> I<00:00:51.530> have<00:00:51.650> kind<00:00:52.070> of<00:00:52.129> big

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:52.339 
not buying that and I have kind of big

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:53.590 
not buying that and I have kind of big
hands<00:00:52.610> so<00:00:52.820> I<00:00:52.940> don't<00:00:53.120> think<00:00:53.210> I<00:00:53.330> would<00:00:53.449> be<00:00:53.540> able

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
hands so I don't think I would be able

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.280 
hands so I don't think I would be able
to<00:00:53.750> get<00:00:53.870> it<00:00:53.960> in<00:00:54.019> there<00:00:54.199> so<00:00:55.210> plan<00:00:56.210> B<00:00:56.239> is<00:00:56.720> to<00:00:56.809> take

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.290 
to get it in there so plan B is to take

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.729 
to get it in there so plan B is to take
the<00:00:57.409> entire<00:00:57.500> trumpet<00:00:58.040> off<00:00:58.629> so<00:00:59.629> to<00:01:00.199> do<00:01:00.320> that<00:01:00.470> I

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.680 

three-point<00:01:13.760> hitch<00:01:16.180> okay<00:01:17.180> and<00:01:17.390> you<00:01:17.450> got<00:01:17.570> to

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
three-point hitch okay and you got to

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.230 
three-point hitch okay and you got to
get<00:01:17.810> it<00:01:17.900> to<00:01:17.990> this<00:01:18.110> position<00:01:18.680> and<00:01:19.550> so<00:01:20.000> at<00:01:20.090> this

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
get it to this position and so at this

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.790 
get it to this position and so at this
point<00:01:22.120> that's<00:01:23.120> still<00:01:23.210> hanging<00:01:23.540> on<00:01:23.780> there<00:01:24.050> but

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:24.800 
point that's still hanging on there but

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.450 
point that's still hanging on there but
this<00:01:24.950> whole<00:01:25.280> assembly<00:01:26.860> this<00:01:27.860> whole<00:01:28.130> assembly

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
this whole assembly this whole assembly

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.640 
this whole assembly this whole assembly

think you have to take the brake off

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.180 
think you have to take the brake off
because<00:01:32.630> you<00:01:33.170> know<00:01:33.260> nothing's<00:01:33.650> touching<00:01:33.890> back

the<00:02:10.039> oil<00:02:10.069> off<00:02:10.580> of<00:02:10.610> it<00:02:10.849> and<00:02:11.030> then<00:02:11.510> I'm<00:02:11.599> gonna<00:02:11.720> use

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
the oil off of it and then I'm gonna use

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.670 
the oil off of it and then I'm gonna use
gasket<00:02:12.709> maker<00:02:12.940> to<00:02:13.940> make<00:02:14.629> a<00:02:14.659> gasket<00:02:15.230> there<00:02:15.470> and

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
gasket maker to make a gasket there and

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.920 
gasket maker to make a gasket there and
then<00:02:15.860> tighten<00:02:16.340> it<00:02:16.549> all<00:02:16.610> up<00:02:16.819> and<00:02:17.060> I'll<00:02:17.780> probably

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
then tighten it all up and I'll probably

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.830 
then tighten it all up and I'll probably
use<00:02:18.110> gasket<00:02:18.590> maker<00:02:18.709> to<00:02:18.920> go<00:02:19.040> around<00:02:19.340> the<00:02:19.840> the

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
use gasket maker to go around the the

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.980 
use gasket maker to go around the the
trumpet<00:02:21.230> itself<00:02:22.330> anyway<00:02:23.330> hope<00:02:23.630> it<00:02:23.750> don't

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
trumpet itself anyway hope it don't

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.449 
trumpet itself anyway hope it don't

I've<00:02:26.790> read<00:02:27.329> it<00:02:27.450> a<00:02:27.510> couple<00:02:27.540> forums<00:02:28.170> couple

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:28.499 
I've read it a couple forums couple

00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:30.080 
I've read it a couple forums couple
posts<00:02:28.859> said<00:02:29.249> that<00:02:29.280> it<00:02:29.519> was<00:02:29.609> supposed<00:02:29.879> to<00:02:29.969> be

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
posts said that it was supposed to be

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.250 
posts said that it was supposed to be
able<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:30.299> just<00:02:30.450> pull<00:02:30.629> this<00:02:30.719> whole<00:02:30.900> thing<00:02:30.959> off

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
able to just pull this whole thing off

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.599 
able to just pull this whole thing off
and<00:02:31.439> it<00:02:31.530> comes<00:02:31.650> off<00:02:31.859> in<00:02:31.980> one<00:02:32.010> piece

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:32.609 
and it comes off in one piece

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:34.399 
and it comes off in one piece
and<00:02:32.819> it<00:02:33.180> would<00:02:33.269> kind<00:02:33.450> of<00:02:33.599> make<00:02:33.780> sense<00:02:34.170> because

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:34.409 
and it would kind of make sense because

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:38.020 
and it would kind of make sense because
this<00:02:34.920> stuff<00:02:35.159> is<00:02:35.310> just<00:02:35.340> free-floating<00:02:35.969> and

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
this stuff is just free-floating and

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.030 
this stuff is just free-floating and
this<00:02:39.030> brake<00:02:39.299> assembly<00:02:39.829> doesn't<00:02:40.829> go<00:02:40.889> all<00:02:41.010> the

this brake assembly doesn't go all the
way<00:02:41.129> through<00:02:41.400> it's<00:02:42.389> only<00:02:42.599> on<00:02:42.780> one<00:02:42.959> side<00:02:43.340> so<00:02:44.340> I'm

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
way through it's only on one side so I'm

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.140 
way through it's only on one side so I'm
hoping<00:02:45.090> that<00:02:46.310> I'll<00:02:47.310> get<00:02:47.430> the<00:02:47.549> desired<00:02:47.849> result

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
hoping that I'll get the desired result

got a problem over there too anyway

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.259 
got a problem over there too anyway
pulling<00:03:15.870> it<00:03:15.959> off<00:03:16.079> was<00:03:16.409> I<00:03:16.949> just<00:03:17.790> improvised

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
pulling it off was I just improvised

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:22.129 
pulling it off was I just improvised
this<00:03:18.799> dolly<00:03:19.799> system<00:03:20.480> that's<00:03:21.480> a<00:03:21.599> motorcycle

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:22.139 
this dolly system that's a motorcycle

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:23.839 
this dolly system that's a motorcycle
stand<00:03:22.379> by<00:03:22.590> the<00:03:22.650> way<00:03:22.829> and<00:03:23.040> that's<00:03:23.189> a<00:03:23.370> seven

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:23.849 
stand by the way and that's a seven

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:28.189 
stand by the way and that's a seven
dollar<00:03:24.709> dolly<00:03:25.709> from<00:03:26.129> Harbor<00:03:26.459> Freight<00:03:26.489> and<00:03:27.199> I

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:28.199 
dollar dolly from Harbor Freight and I

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:29.929 
dollar dolly from Harbor Freight and I
wedged<00:03:28.439> it<00:03:28.650> up<00:03:28.799> so<00:03:28.919> it<00:03:28.980> was<00:03:29.040> just<00:03:29.340> perfect<00:03:29.819> and

00:03:29.929 --> 00:03:29.939 
wedged it up so it was just perfect and

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:32.089 
wedged it up so it was just perfect and
I<00:03:30.030> slid<00:03:30.329> it<00:03:30.419> right<00:03:30.569> out<00:03:30.780> I<00:03:31.049> think<00:03:31.709> it's<00:03:31.919> heavier

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:32.099 
I slid it right out I think it's heavier

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:36.460 
I slid it right out I think it's heavier
on<00:03:32.400> this<00:03:32.609> side<00:03:34.129> but<00:03:35.129> came<00:03:35.579> apart<00:03:35.759> real<00:03:35.939> good

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
on this side but came apart real good

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.619 
on this side but came apart real good
realized<00:03:37.470> while<00:03:37.680> it's<00:03:37.829> leaking<00:03:38.250> the<00:03:39.090> gasket

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:39.629 
realized while it's leaking the gasket

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:44.629 
realized while it's leaking the gasket
is<00:03:39.750> like<00:03:40.049> cracked<00:03:40.799> and<00:03:41.419> shot<00:03:42.419> everywhere<00:03:43.639> one

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:44.639 
is like cracked and shot everywhere one

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:46.429 
is like cracked and shot everywhere one
of<00:03:44.729> the<00:03:44.819> studs<00:03:45.120> came<00:03:45.449> out<00:03:45.599> to<00:03:45.840> that<00:03:46.079> stud

00:03:46.429 --> 00:03:46.439 
of the studs came out to that stud

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:48.460 
of the studs came out to that stud
started<00:03:47.009> coming<00:03:47.250> out<00:03:47.280> so<00:03:47.489> I<00:03:47.549> got<00:03:47.699> to<00:03:47.790> fix<00:03:47.939> that

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
started coming out so I got to fix that

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.759 
started coming out so I got to fix that
but<00:03:49.470> like<00:03:50.250> everybody<00:03:50.489> says<00:03:51.379> it's<00:03:52.379> not<00:03:52.530> overly

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
but like everybody says it's not overly

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:56.330 
but like everybody says it's not overly
difficult<00:03:52.979> to<00:03:53.250> take<00:03:53.340> off<00:03:54.590> and<00:03:55.590> if<00:03:55.889> we<00:03:55.919> turn<00:03:56.220> it

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
difficult to take off and if we turn it

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.900 
difficult to take off and if we turn it
around<00:03:56.430> here

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.310 

look<00:04:00.910> what's<00:04:01.090> going<00:04:01.150> on<00:04:01.450> behind<00:04:01.660> here<00:04:02.110> and

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
look what's going on behind here and

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:07.020 
look what's going on behind here and
sure<00:04:02.560> enough<00:04:02.590> there<00:04:03.070> is<00:04:03.190> a<00:04:03.220> bull<00:04:03.870> and<00:04:06.030> that's

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
sure enough there is a bull and that's

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.700 
sure enough there is a bull and that's
the<00:04:07.270> part<00:04:07.540> that's<00:04:07.570> leaking<00:04:07.930> and<00:04:08.380> it<00:04:08.440> has<00:04:08.590> to

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:08.710 
the part that's leaking and it has to

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:10.290 
the part that's leaking and it has to
come<00:04:08.860> off<00:04:08.980> I<00:04:09.220> was<00:04:09.670> led<00:04:09.820> to<00:04:09.850> believe<00:04:10.000> it<00:04:10.210> that's

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:10.300 
come off I was led to believe it that's

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.410 
come off I was led to believe it that's
a<00:04:10.450> cage<00:04:10.660> nut<00:04:10.960> but<00:04:11.370> my<00:04:12.370> I'm<00:04:12.820> thinking<00:04:13.270> that's

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
a cage nut but my I'm thinking that's

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.330 
a cage nut but my I'm thinking that's
not<00:04:13.510> original<00:04:14.170> the<00:04:14.350> original<00:04:14.380> not<00:04:14.950> because

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
not original the original not because

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.509 
not original the original not because
it's<00:04:15.580> painted<00:04:16.000> blue<00:04:16.299> for<00:04:16.660> one<00:04:16.900> and<00:04:17.530> the<00:04:18.340> rest

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
it's painted blue for one and the rest

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:19.560 
it's painted blue for one and the rest
of<00:04:18.580> the<00:04:18.700> inside<00:04:19.030> of<00:04:19.120> this<00:04:19.180> thing<00:04:19.239> isn't

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
of the inside of this thing isn't

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:28.470 
of the inside of this thing isn't
painted<00:04:19.989> blue<00:04:20.430> and<00:04:24.810> interesting<00:04:27.480> that's

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:28.480 
painted blue and interesting that's

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.030 
painted blue and interesting that's
probably<00:04:28.870> why<00:04:28.990> it<00:04:29.050> came<00:04:29.290> loose<00:04:29.530> someone<00:04:29.920> had

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.040 
probably why it came loose someone had

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.370 
probably why it came loose someone had
ended<00:04:30.310> up<00:04:30.400> one<00:04:30.610> time<00:04:30.880> and<00:04:31.240> then<00:04:31.390> it<00:04:31.420> was<00:04:31.750> it

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
ended up one time and then it was it

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.230 
ended up one time and then it was it
just<00:04:32.710> shook<00:04:33.370> loose<00:04:33.580> like<00:04:33.790> everything<00:04:34.090> else

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
just shook loose like everything else

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.000 
just shook loose like everything else
actually<00:04:34.840> most<00:04:35.110> of<00:04:35.230> those<00:04:35.380> bolts<00:04:35.680> that<00:04:35.890> were

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
actually most of those bolts that were

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.550 
actually most of those bolts that were
on<00:04:36.130> there<00:04:36.630> we're<00:04:37.630> nearly<00:04:37.840> hand<00:04:38.140> tight<00:04:38.380> the

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
on there we're nearly hand tight the

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.960 
on there we're nearly hand tight the
ones<00:04:38.710> at<00:04:38.830> the<00:04:38.860> top<00:04:39.070> especially<00:04:39.280> one<00:04:39.790> was

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
ones at the top especially one was

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.090 
ones at the top especially one was
missing<00:04:40.300> completely<00:04:40.780> so<00:04:41.680> I<00:04:41.710> assume<00:04:42.070> that

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
missing completely so I assume that

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.400 
missing completely so I assume that
that's<00:04:42.430> a<00:04:42.520> pretty<00:04:42.700> common<00:04:42.970> problem<00:04:43.270> and<00:04:43.630> then

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
that's a pretty common problem and then

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.380 
that's a pretty common problem and then
looking<00:04:44.740> at<00:04:44.830> the<00:04:44.980> rest<00:04:45.220> of<00:04:45.340> that<00:04:45.460> I<00:04:45.760> mean<00:04:46.360> I

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390 
looking at the rest of that I mean I

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:51.410 
looking at the rest of that I mean I
assume<00:04:46.630> it's<00:04:47.050> all<00:04:47.200> good<00:04:47.410> I'm<00:04:47.590> no<00:04:47.740> mechanic<00:04:49.110> but

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:51.420 
assume it's all good I'm no mechanic but

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.700 
assume it's all good I'm no mechanic but
this<00:04:52.420> particular<00:04:52.570> job<00:04:53.050> for<00:04:53.320> the<00:04:53.380> leaking

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
this particular job for the leaking

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.100 
this particular job for the leaking
pivot<00:04:54.310> pin<00:04:54.460> here<00:04:54.640> not<00:04:55.540> a<00:04:55.570> big<00:04:55.750> deal

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
pivot pin here not a big deal

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.170 
pivot pin here not a big deal
hey<00:04:56.920> it's<00:04:57.070> daylight<00:04:57.370> so<00:04:57.550> I<00:04:57.610> figured<00:04:57.910> I<00:04:58.030> would

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
hey it's daylight so I figured I would

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.440 
hey it's daylight so I figured I would
take<00:04:58.990> a<00:04:59.050> video<00:04:59.230> that<00:04:59.560> you<00:04:59.620> could<00:04:59.770> see<00:05:00.450> and

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:01.450 
take a video that you could see and

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:02.610 
take a video that you could see and
that's<00:05:01.570> what<00:05:01.720> the<00:05:01.840> back<00:05:01.990> of<00:05:02.140> that<00:05:02.200> thing<00:05:02.260> looks

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
that's what the back of that thing looks

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.620 
that's what the back of that thing looks
like<00:05:02.680> and<00:05:03.460> I've<00:05:03.790> been<00:05:03.910> calling<00:05:04.180> her<00:05:04.240> the<00:05:04.330> pivot

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
like and I've been calling her the pivot

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.260 
like and I've been calling her the pivot
pin<00:05:04.750> the<00:05:04.930> whole<00:05:05.050> time<00:05:05.290> but<00:05:05.560> it's<00:05:05.680> actually<00:05:06.270> the

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
pin the whole time but it's actually the

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.300 
pin the whole time but it's actually the
lower<00:05:07.510> lift<00:05:07.840> pin<00:05:08.200> and<00:05:08.860> it<00:05:08.950> goes<00:05:09.100> right<00:05:09.250> through

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
lower lift pin and it goes right through

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:10.100 
lower lift pin and it goes right through
there

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
there

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.270 
there
and<00:05:11.110> that's<00:05:11.320> what<00:05:11.440> you're<00:05:11.530> looking<00:05:11.770> at<00:05:11.890> and

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 
and that's what you're looking at and

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.100 
and that's what you're looking at and
there<00:05:12.910> is<00:05:13.000> supposed<00:05:13.270> to<00:05:13.330> be<00:05:13.480> a<00:05:13.510> crown<00:05:13.750> nut<00:05:13.990> on

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
there is supposed to be a crown nut on

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.140 
there is supposed to be a crown nut on
the<00:05:14.200> other<00:05:14.230> end<00:05:14.730> anyway

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.150 
the other end anyway

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:22.020 
the other end anyway
I<00:05:16.380> cleaned<00:05:17.380> it<00:05:17.500> all<00:05:17.560> off<00:05:18.300> in<00:05:19.300> preparation<00:05:21.030> just

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
I cleaned it all off in preparation just

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:23.750 
I cleaned it all off in preparation just
bought<00:05:22.180> one<00:05:22.330> of<00:05:22.360> these<00:05:22.510> just<00:05:23.260> a<00:05:23.290> couple<00:05:23.470> bucks

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:23.760 
bought one of these just a couple bucks

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.360 
bought one of these just a couple bucks
get<00:05:24.760> the<00:05:24.880> hard<00:05:25.030> stuff<00:05:25.270> off<00:05:26.040> come<00:05:27.040> through<00:05:27.250> and

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
get the hard stuff off come through and

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.900 
get the hard stuff off come through and
clean<00:05:27.520> it<00:05:27.640> up<00:05:27.700> with<00:05:27.820> a<00:05:27.910> nice<00:05:28.060> pad<00:05:29.669> did<00:05:30.669> the<00:05:30.760> same

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:30.910 
clean it up with a nice pad did the same

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:33.240 
clean it up with a nice pad did the same
of<00:05:31.030> the<00:05:31.090> other<00:05:31.120> side<00:05:31.800> so<00:05:32.800> it's<00:05:32.950> pretty<00:05:33.160> much

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250 
of the other side so it's pretty much

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.159 
of the other side so it's pretty much
ready<00:05:33.400> to<00:05:33.520> go<00:05:33.580> together<00:05:33.780> but<00:05:34.780> I<00:05:34.810> need<00:05:35.020> to<00:05:35.080> buy

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:35.169 
ready to go together but I need to buy

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:37.230 
ready to go together but I need to buy
some<00:05:35.380> parts<00:05:35.710> I<00:05:35.919> decided<00:05:36.700> I'm<00:05:36.820> gonna<00:05:36.940> get<00:05:37.210> a

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.240 
some parts I decided I'm gonna get a

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.120 
some parts I decided I'm gonna get a
gasket<00:05:37.660> for<00:05:37.780> this<00:05:37.930> since<00:05:38.140> it's<00:05:38.290> so<00:05:38.440> big<00:05:38.650> and<00:05:38.680> I

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:39.130 
gasket for this since it's so big and I

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.490 
gasket for this since it's so big and I
don't<00:05:39.940> really<00:05:40.270> want<00:05:40.450> to<00:05:40.480> use<00:05:40.540> gasket<00:05:41.050> maker<00:05:41.200> on

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 
don't really want to use gasket maker on

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.320 
don't really want to use gasket maker on
it<00:05:41.650> it<00:05:41.830> just<00:05:42.010> didn't<00:05:42.280> seem<00:05:42.669> right<00:05:42.880> and<00:05:43.120> since<00:05:43.240> I

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:43.330 
it it just didn't seem right and since I

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.180 
it it just didn't seem right and since I
had<00:05:43.480> it<00:05:43.570> all<00:05:43.660> apart<00:05:43.960> I<00:05:44.169> might<00:05:44.350> as<00:05:44.410> well<00:05:44.470> do<00:05:45.100> the

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.190 
had it all apart I might as well do the

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:52.610 
had it all apart I might as well do the
right<00:05:46.830> but<00:05:47.830> the<00:05:48.070> lower<00:05:48.460> lift<00:05:48.820> pin<00:05:49.440> assembly

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.440 

problem<00:05:53.620> was<00:05:53.740> that<00:05:53.950> this<00:05:54.580> isn't<00:05:54.790> a<00:05:54.970> crown<00:05:55.210> nut

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:55.450 
problem was that this isn't a crown nut

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:57.060 
problem was that this isn't a crown nut
and<00:05:55.690> it's<00:05:56.200> supposed<00:05:56.500> to<00:05:56.560> have<00:05:56.710> a<00:05:56.740> crown<00:05:57.040> that

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:57.070 
and it's supposed to have a crown that

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:00.200 
and it's supposed to have a crown that
on<00:05:57.340> the<00:05:57.430> back<00:05:57.610> end<00:05:57.880> that<00:05:58.120> goes<00:05:59.050> through<00:05:59.350> there

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:00.210 
on the back end that goes through there

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.540 
on the back end that goes through there
and<00:06:01.210> used<00:06:02.200> to<00:06:02.320> crown<00:06:02.650> that<00:06:02.830> on<00:06:03.010> it<00:06:03.160> and<00:06:03.340> there's

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:03.550 
and used to crown that on it and there's

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:05.850 
and used to crown that on it and there's
a<00:06:03.610> hole<00:06:03.960> right<00:06:04.960> there<00:06:05.020> that's<00:06:05.530> supposed<00:06:05.800> to

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:05.860 
a hole right there that's supposed to
