00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
pretty much the same shape and

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.419 
pretty much the same shape and
everything<00:00:27.300> so<00:00:27.960> it<00:00:28.199> fits<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.650> thin<00:00:28.830> case<00:00:29.099> well

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
side both in terms of design and to fit

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.780

this<00:00:46.920> is<00:00:47.070> number<00:00:47.420> 225<00:00:48.440> style<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:50.309> this<00:00:50.550> is

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
this is number 225 style and this is

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.090 
this is number 225 style and this is
what<00:00:50.910> it<00:00:50.940> looks<00:00:51.149> like<00:00:51.300> in<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.539> back<00:00:51.860> now<00:00:52.860> this

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
what it looks like in the back now this

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.220 
what it looks like in the back now this
review<00:00:53.520> is<00:00:53.550> definitely<00:00:54.510> probably<00:00:54.899> not

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.869 
review is definitely probably not
suitable<00:00:55.590> for<00:00:55.649> everyone<00:00:56.070> because<00:00:56.370> some

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
suitable for everyone because some

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.450 
suitable for everyone because some
people<00:00:57.149> think<00:00:57.480> this<00:00:57.629> is<00:00:57.690> absolutely<00:00:58.500> horrible

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
like an ariel mermaid one it really

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.450

makes<00:03:11.670> the<00:03:11.790> phone<00:03:11.910> quite<00:03:12.270> heavy<00:03:12.600> which<00:03:13.470> is

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
makes the phone quite heavy which is

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.430 
makes the phone quite heavy which is
both<00:03:14.520> a<00:03:14.790> plus<00:03:15.120> and<00:03:15.300> a<00:03:15.360> minus<00:03:15.510> I<00:03:15.870> find<00:03:16.170> that<00:03:16.260> if<00:03:16.350> I

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
both a plus and a minus I find that if I

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.020 
both a plus and a minus I find that if I
don't<00:03:16.500> have<00:03:16.740> a<00:03:16.800> case<00:03:16.980> on<00:03:17.160> it<00:03:17.220> so<00:03:17.520> thin<00:03:17.820> that

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
don't have a case on it so thin that

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.360 
don't have a case on it so thin that
quite<00:03:18.600> easily<00:03:18.630> I<00:03:19.320> can<00:03:19.620> like<00:03:19.770> slip<00:03:20.220> it<00:03:20.340> through

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
quite easily I can like slip it through

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.630 
quite easily I can like slip it through
my<00:03:20.580> fingers<00:03:20.640> or<00:03:21.510> just<00:03:22.290> not<00:03:22.470> realize<00:03:22.950> that<00:03:23.490> you

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
my fingers or just not realize that you

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.310 
my fingers or just not realize that you
know<00:03:23.670> it's<00:03:23.940> in<00:03:24.090> my<00:03:24.120> pocket<00:03:24.420> whereas<00:03:24.990> with<00:03:25.050> this

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
know it's in my pocket whereas with this

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:33.960 
know it's in my pocket whereas with this
case<00:03:25.620> it's<00:03:26.040> much<00:03:26.190> easier

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.930 

I<00:03:34.620> think<00:03:35.620> it's<00:03:35.740> really<00:03:35.890> cute<00:03:36.220> it<00:03:36.520> makes<00:03:36.760> me

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
I think it's really cute it makes me

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.690 
I think it's really cute it makes me
smile<00:03:37.270> and<00:03:37.660> it<00:03:38.440> makes<00:03:38.620> my<00:03:38.830> phone<00:03:39.010> stand<00:03:39.340> out<00:03:39.490> if

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
smile and it makes my phone stand out if

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.370 
smile and it makes my phone stand out if
I<00:03:39.820> manage<00:03:40.000> to<00:03:40.120> grind<00:03:40.360> on<00:03:40.450> my<00:03:40.540> bag<00:03:40.750> I<00:03:40.990> can<00:03:41.140> find

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
I manage to grind on my bag I can find

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.840 
I manage to grind on my bag I can find
it<00:03:41.500> really<00:03:41.710> easily<00:03:41.980> because<00:03:42.460> you<00:03:42.610> know<00:03:42.730> the

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
it really easily because you know the

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.900 
it really easily because you know the
back<00:03:43.000> is<00:03:43.180> so<00:03:43.330> textured
