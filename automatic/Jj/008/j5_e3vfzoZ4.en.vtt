00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.050
 We know the construction of the new 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.670

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.550
 now mainly on the north side 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.420
 place with the construction of the platforms 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.420
 the roof and the give 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.410
 are now at the stationssingel we look 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.230
 out onto the building site like that now here 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.970
 has been put into service and at 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.060
 work currently taking place 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:03.460
 for intended to the roof as it is already on 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:06.130
 the east side of the station is because 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.900
 further by involving with columns 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.880
 they were always first on the platform 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.010
 that's being put together now on this one 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.930
 construction site and you see it 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.580
 Slowly the coming months here 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.170
 to be placed 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.510
 and then further in a westerly direction 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.490
 end up on the platform when they are standing 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.380
 the roof is put down again and 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.420
 then that is closed with 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.369
 that big crane that construction crane that now on 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.830
 the construction site is set 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.690
 work in this area and the 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:35.580
 work on the 7th platform 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.580
 ready in April this year 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.020
 but here you can nicely cover the canopy 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.670
 see above the tracks as they already show me 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.810
 and the new ones 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.880
 rear facade 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.070
 You can also see sheet pile boards here 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.600
 that sheet pile will soon become the ground 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.030
 inbred 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.220
 and the soil between the sheet pile and 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.200
 this is all being excavated 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.360
 and that frees up space 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.220
 soon the new unguarded 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.580
 bicycle parking at stations rule 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.580
 able to build 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.690
 November is the new one last year 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.920

 we will go to the rotterdam municipality together 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.790
 the go-ahead 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.790
 3 2 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.950
 much wider wider lighter with stores 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.520
 everything we want 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:51.290
 so yes a warm welcome from the city 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.290
 the station to the traveler 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.830
 the passenger passage is now almost ready 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.060
 there are still a few points that must 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.020
 to be finished 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.820
 one of the points you still need 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.220
 All blind guides are happening 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.470
 now lie those metal ribbed strips 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.750
 that are replaced by natural stone 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.880
 with ripple trip strip it will be further 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:15.030
 furniture in the passage the benches 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.530
 trash cans but also the departure states 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.630
 are all being replaced by new ones 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.670
 material and last but not least 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.350
 in the passage must be done with all 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.330
 wooden stairs the temporary stairs 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:27.060
 where the escalators step without being made 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.190
 be going in the course of April May 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:33.769
 they are all removed and you can 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.769
 from there with the escalator to the platform 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.879
 and to make those escalators is in 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:40.739
 the old temporary traveler tunnel now 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:41.790
 worked hard to finally have to 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.470
 tunnel will again serve as 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.489
 bicycle connection between the Provenierswijk 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.489
 in the centre 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.540
 we used to have the old one here 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.040
 stairs to for us we 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.720
 have all the stairs here now 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.580
 demolished 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.940
 we are now working on the new one here 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:02.340
 escalator construction made of concrete 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:04.380
 with the new going from the passage 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.430
 the intention is that we later this this 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.200
 access closed 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.600
 deposit and this becomes complete 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.530
 filled up with sand so we got the prompt 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.530
 can bring to luring 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:23.150
 this is the new escalator bin 

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:24.710
 well to be able to tackle this 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.289
 we first put a temporary staircase down there 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:30.470
 must put this so that travelers are up 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:33.380
 We could now do the escalators 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.870
 mount on the can this hole can then 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:39.009
 be filled with sand and I can do the 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.009
 be served 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.100
 the new travelers' beet 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.570
 traveler not only access the 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.130
 platforms but also provides a large 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.480
 number of stores 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.520
 rotterdam central now has the first 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.810
 drive this varied and large 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.140
 retail offer 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:06.140
 other stations will follow you later 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:07.670
 we think it's important that the customer 

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:09.590
 his travel time 

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:11.240
 it also looks like useful time 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:13.130
 pleasant experience 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.380
 because we know from research that and 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:18.020
 a train journey for example through a 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:20.390
 customer positive is appreciated as 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:22.130
 that waiting time that also belongs 10 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:26.770
 minutes can be spent and offers there 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:26.770
 this trip x passage to empty all of 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:35.310
 well as you see we are we are 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:36.960
 actually finished the stores 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.910
 we have another one after November 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.070
 number of new stores opened 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:44.190
 what makes that at the moment 25 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:46.560
 stores in the journey passage are ours 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:48.360
 I think the latest additions is 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:52.010
 like to mention that all known 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.010
 cake baker from the rotterdam 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:59.190
 and behind this is a space where yours is 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:00.870
 hears and sees that still very loud 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:02.310
 being worked on 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:04.230
 if it's good for the summer 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:05.550
 three new stores there 

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:07.320
 one is an extension of 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:08.910
 coffee assortment 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.770
 which can be found in the rear-end trip 

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:12.720
 is a store where books and 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:14.220
 journals will be sold and 

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:17.430
 there will be another store where on this 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:20.150
 it is not yet clear what that is 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:20.150
 to be precise 

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:28.790
 and what is very nice to report that 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:31.400
 comes an information desk where ours 

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:33.830
 customers can both go for reits 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.180
 related information but also true 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:37.340
 they provide tourist information 

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:39.140
 can get to Rotterdam and for that 

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:42.220
 we are now working very closely together 

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:42.220
 with rotterdam marketing 

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:49.980
 in the central hall we are almost finished 

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:51.030
 with all the natural stone we lay 

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:52.830
 of course have huge ones here 

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:55.110
 surface already laid down the only one 

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:57.630
 part that still needs to be done is for 

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:58.680
 along the fines on and along the facade 

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:01.050
 from the station 

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:03.270

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:06.360

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:10.560
 which is now underway so that there is a nice one 

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:13.470
 even distribution of light in the hall 

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:15.780
 and that is supplemented with extra 

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:20.600
 spots and those spots will hang under 

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:20.600
 the flat parts of the roof 

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:28.710
 the woodwork inside the station hall 

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:32.100
 that is completely finished and that will run soon 

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:33.720
 by under the canopy of the roof 

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:35.640
 there is a very large part for that 

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:37.020
 already be in the last residues by 

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:39.630
 deviated 

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:40.980

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:43.580
 then the competitions we will start now 

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:43.580
 with that work
