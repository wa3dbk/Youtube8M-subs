students<00:00:17.039> who<00:00:17.130> is<00:00:17.250> 70<00:00:17.670> I<00:00:17.850> mean<00:00:18.210> it's<00:00:18.539> really<00:00:18.810> a

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
students who is 70 I mean it's really a

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.570 
students who is 70 I mean it's really a
wide<00:00:19.199> range<00:00:19.529> and<00:00:19.770> I<00:00:19.859> think<00:00:20.160> actually<00:00:20.369> that's

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
wide range and I think actually that's

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.820 
wide range and I think actually that's
hugely<00:00:20.939> enriching<00:00:21.510> for<00:00:21.539> all<00:00:22.109> of<00:00:22.289> them<00:00:22.500> and

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
hugely enriching for all of them and

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.250 
hugely enriching for all of them and
many<00:00:23.189> students<00:00:23.580> come<00:00:23.760> you<00:00:24.210> know<00:00:24.330> bringing<00:00:24.840> an
