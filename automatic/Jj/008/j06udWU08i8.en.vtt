00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.450 
same type of cape that goes all the way
down<00:03:12.310> to<00:03:12.880> the<00:03:13.090> very<00:03:13.360> bottom<00:03:13.600> of<00:03:13.990> his<00:03:14.200> feet<00:03:14.500> the

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:15.460 
down to the very bottom of his feet the

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.210 
down to the very bottom of his feet the
cape<00:03:15.700> is<00:03:15.880> pretty<00:03:16.240> soft<00:03:16.540> actually<00:03:17.100> so<00:03:18.100> it

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
cape is pretty soft actually so it

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.560 
cape is pretty soft actually so it
doesn't<00:03:18.490> get<00:03:18.610> in<00:03:18.730> the<00:03:18.820> way<00:03:18.910> too<00:03:18.970> much<00:03:19.270> now<00:03:19.510> the

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
doesn't get in the way too much now the

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.180 
doesn't get in the way too much now the
problem<00:03:20.200> is<00:03:20.350> with<00:03:20.560> it<00:03:20.680> going<00:03:20.890> all<00:03:21.010> the<00:03:21.100> way

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
problem is with it going all the way

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.890 
problem is with it going all the way
down<00:03:21.370> to<00:03:21.490> the<00:03:21.610> feet<00:03:21.850> you<00:03:22.060> kind<00:03:22.570> of<00:03:22.660> run<00:03:22.780> into

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
down to the feet you kind of run into

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.540 
down to the feet you kind of run into
some<00:03:23.140> of<00:03:23.230> the<00:03:23.320> same<00:03:23.530> problems<00:03:23.800> we<00:03:24.100> had<00:03:24.310> with

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550 
some of the same problems we had with

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.550 
some of the same problems we had with
scare<00:03:25.030> glow<00:03:25.300> where<00:03:25.900> when<00:03:26.170> the<00:03:26.260> figure<00:03:26.440> is

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
scare glow where when the figure is

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.550 
scare glow where when the figure is
standing<00:03:27.250> straight<00:03:27.850> up<00:03:28.120> that's<00:03:29.110> perfectly

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
standing straight up that's perfectly

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.770 
standing straight up that's perfectly
fine<00:03:29.830> but<00:03:30.640> when<00:03:30.880> you<00:03:31.000> want<00:03:31.210> to<00:03:31.300> start<00:03:31.510> posing

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
fine but when you want to start posing

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.290 
fine but when you want to start posing
him<00:03:32.140> and<00:03:32.650> bending<00:03:33.340> his<00:03:33.460> knees<00:03:33.670> and<00:03:33.970> his<00:03:34.060> legs

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
him and bending his knees and his legs

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.570 
him and bending his knees and his legs
that<00:03:34.690> cape<00:03:35.050> really<00:03:35.680> kind<00:03:35.950> of<00:03:36.070> gets<00:03:36.220> in<00:03:36.340> the<00:03:36.370> way

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:36.580 
that cape really kind of gets in the way

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.760 
that cape really kind of gets in the way
see<00:03:36.970> it<00:03:37.240> kind<00:03:37.450> of<00:03:37.510> hinders<00:03:37.750> it<00:03:38.200> because<00:03:38.470> the

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:38.770 
see it kind of hinders it because the

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:40.770 
see it kind of hinders it because the
cape<00:03:39.130> once<00:03:39.820> the<00:03:39.910> knees<00:03:40.030> are<00:03:40.210> bent<00:03:40.390> the<00:03:40.570> cape

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
cape once the knees are bent the cape

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.449 
cape once the knees are bent the cape
becomes<00:03:41.140> longer<00:03:41.410> than<00:03:41.620> the<00:03:41.680> legs<00:03:41.920> so<00:03:42.190> it<00:03:42.310> does

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
becomes longer than the legs so it does

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.240 
becomes longer than the legs so it does
kind<00:03:42.670> of<00:03:42.700> get<00:03:42.790> in<00:03:42.910> the<00:03:42.970> way<00:03:43.000> just<00:03:43.510> a<00:03:43.690> little<00:03:43.720> bit

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
kind of get in the way just a little bit

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.830 
kind of get in the way just a little bit
also<00:03:45.250> it's<00:03:45.670> worth<00:03:45.760> noting<00:03:46.000> that<00:03:46.209> the<00:03:46.540> way<00:03:46.690> the

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
also it's worth noting that the way the

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.199 
also it's worth noting that the way the
head<00:03:47.050> is<00:03:47.320> sculpted<00:03:47.830> with<00:03:48.310> the<00:03:48.430> long<00:03:48.640> hair<00:03:48.940> and

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
head is sculpted with the long hair and

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:52.229 
head is sculpted with the long hair and
the<00:03:49.660> cape<00:03:49.959> around<00:03:50.530> him<00:03:50.800> it<00:03:51.010> is<00:03:51.489> a<00:03:51.520> little<00:03:51.940> hard

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
the cape around him it is a little hard

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:54.540 
the cape around him it is a little hard
to<00:03:52.390> turn<00:03:52.600> that<00:03:52.840> head<00:03:53.200> you're<00:03:53.590> not<00:03:53.800> gonna<00:03:54.040> get<00:03:54.340> a

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:54.550 
to turn that head you're not gonna get a

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:56.699 
to turn that head you're not gonna get a
lot<00:03:54.820> of<00:03:55.030> movement<00:03:55.239> out<00:03:55.660> of<00:03:55.690> his<00:03:55.930> head<00:03:56.140> turning

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
lot of movement out of his head turning

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:58.320 
lot of movement out of his head turning
it<00:03:56.860> left<00:03:57.040> and<00:03:57.220> right<00:03:57.250> is<00:03:57.610> pretty<00:03:57.910> complicated

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330 
it left and right is pretty complicated

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.949 
it left and right is pretty complicated
because<00:03:58.750> the<00:03:59.230> hair<00:03:59.440> hits<00:03:59.739> the<00:03:59.950> cape<00:04:00.959> so

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
because the hair hits the cape so

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:05.490 
because the hair hits the cape so
there's<00:04:02.680> that<00:04:03.040> now<00:04:03.489> the<00:04:04.480> armor<00:04:04.840> is<00:04:04.989> removable

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
there's that now the armor is removable

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.350 
there's that now the armor is removable
same<00:04:06.250> style<00:04:06.550> as<00:04:06.670> what<00:04:06.880> we're<00:04:07.000> used<00:04:07.239> to<00:04:07.300> seeing

same style as what we're used to seeing

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.290 
same style as what we're used to seeing
the<00:04:07.930> head<00:04:08.110> pops<00:04:08.380> off<00:04:08.640> you<00:04:09.640> got<00:04:09.790> the<00:04:09.910> Cape<00:04:10.120> as<00:04:10.270> a

separate piece and then the shoulder

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.850 
separate piece and then the shoulder
armor<00:04:13.420> is<00:04:13.570> all<00:04:13.750> connected<00:04:14.110> one<00:04:14.530> solid<00:04:14.830> piece

once you've got the armor removed it's

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.270 
once you've got the armor removed it's
pretty<00:04:22.060> obvious<00:04:22.600> that<00:04:22.630> most<00:04:23.169> of<00:04:23.500> the<00:04:23.620> body<00:04:23.860> is
