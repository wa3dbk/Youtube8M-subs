show you how to make a mechanical pencil

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.000 
show you how to make a mechanical pencil
out<00:00:05.250> of<00:00:05.520> a<00:00:05.700> pin<00:00:06.089> now<00:00:06.930> this<00:00:07.379> is<00:00:07.529> not<00:00:07.710> yet

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
the only part the mechanical pencil that

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:09.480 
the only part the mechanical pencil that
you<00:01:03.180> actually

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.580

pretty quick have to start packing you
go<00:01:12.740> to<00:01:12.920> HD<00:01:13.159> and<00:01:13.850> it's<00:01:14.000> been<00:01:14.179> right<00:01:14.390> yeah<00:01:14.899> so

00:01:15.849 --> 00:01:15.859 
go to HD and it's been right yeah so

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:17.859 
go to HD and it's been right yeah so
this<00:01:16.009> is<00:01:16.189> the<00:01:16.310> only<00:01:16.579> part<00:01:17.390> of<00:01:17.630> the<00:01:17.719> mechanical

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
this is the only part of the mechanical

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:19.510 
this is the only part of the mechanical

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
want the whole pin except for the ink

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.029 
want the whole pin except for the ink
you<00:01:23.600> don't<00:01:23.780> want<00:01:23.929> the<00:01:24.049> ink<00:01:24.259> you<00:01:24.740> know<00:01:24.829> what

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:25.039 
you don't want the ink you know what

that eat thing you want the whole pin

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.779 
that eat thing you want the whole pin
except<00:01:27.500> for<00:01:27.649> the<00:01:27.740> ink<00:01:27.950> so<00:01:28.280> you<00:01:28.340> want<00:01:28.670> the

spring okay so after you have like this

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.410 
spring okay so after you have like this
and<00:01:33.200> you<00:01:33.259> put<00:01:33.439> a<00:01:33.469> piece<00:01:33.530> of<00:01:34.039> lead<00:01:34.280> in<00:01:34.459> you<00:01:35.240> want

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
and you put a piece of lead in you want

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.990 
and you put a piece of lead in you want
to<00:01:35.450> get<00:01:35.600> this<00:01:36.020> part<00:01:37.780> of<00:01:38.780> the<00:01:39.200> pin<00:01:39.409> you<00:01:39.530> see<00:01:39.709> that

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
to get this part of the pin you see that

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:49.649 
to get this part of the pin you see that
and<00:01:41.000> then<00:01:41.149> you<00:01:41.270> want<00:01:41.390> to<00:01:41.569> put<00:01:45.489> BAM<00:01:47.289> see<00:01:48.289> that

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
and then you want to put BAM see that

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:56.740 
and then you want to put BAM see that
and<00:01:51.729> action<00:01:54.069> how<00:01:55.069> to<00:01:55.130> put<00:01:55.399> the<00:01:55.520> bed<00:01:55.700> in<00:01:55.939> and<00:01:56.390> how

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
and action how to put the bed in and how

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.389 
and action how to put the bed in and how
to<00:01:57.619> get<00:01:57.860> the<00:01:58.009> lead<00:01:58.250> out<00:01:58.489> now<00:01:59.420> um<00:01:59.950> before<00:02:00.950> we<00:02:01.159> do

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
to get the lead out now um before we do

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:05.080 
to get the lead out now um before we do
that<00:02:01.429> you<00:02:01.909> want<00:02:02.270> to<00:02:02.329> get<00:02:02.450> the<00:02:02.630> top<00:02:02.929> part<00:02:04.090> you

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
that you want to get the top part you

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.319 
that you want to get the top part you
want<00:02:05.329> to<00:02:05.420> actually<00:02:05.869> put<00:02:06.110> the<00:02:06.289> spring<00:02:06.619> in<00:02:07.329> here

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:08.329 
want to actually put the spring in here

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:10.569 
want to actually put the spring in here
I<00:02:08.420> put<00:02:08.660> the<00:02:08.810> spring<00:02:09.170> in<00:02:09.200> mind<00:02:09.530> if<00:02:10.129> you<00:02:10.250> can<00:02:10.399> see

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:10.579 
I put the spring in mind if you can see

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:17.580 
I put the spring in mind if you can see
the<00:02:10.700> spring<00:02:11.500> okay<00:02:12.670> and<00:02:14.139> then<00:02:15.139> you<00:02:15.290> want<00:02:15.470> to<00:02:15.560> get

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
the spring okay and then you want to get

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:31.410 
the spring okay and then you want to get
the<00:02:18.590> bottom<00:02:18.950> part

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:42.420 

there<00:02:32.420> you<00:02:32.480> go<00:02:40.210> as<00:02:41.210> easy<00:02:41.450> as<00:02:41.660> that
