welcome<00:00:00.750> to<00:00:00.870> lecture<00:00:01.199> online<00:00:01.350> and<00:00:01.740> here<00:00:01.920> we're

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
welcome to lecture online and here we're

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.679 
welcome to lecture online and here we're
going<00:00:02.190> to<00:00:02.280> look<00:00:02.370> at<00:00:02.550> our<00:00:02.790> sail<00:00:03.060> circuits<00:00:03.510> and

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
going to look at our sail circuits and

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.860 
going to look at our sail circuits and
complex<00:00:04.589> numbers<00:00:04.859> as<00:00:05.370> I<00:00:05.549> alluded<00:00:06.240> to<00:00:06.359> the<00:00:06.480> two

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
complex numbers as I alluded to the two

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.680 
complex numbers as I alluded to the two
that<00:00:07.020> in<00:00:07.259> the<00:00:07.379> first<00:00:07.589> video<00:00:08.000> we're<00:00:09.000> going<00:00:09.599> to

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
that in the first video we're going to

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.410 
that in the first video we're going to
be<00:00:09.840> able<00:00:09.929> to<00:00:10.050> express<00:00:10.710> the<00:00:11.040> impedance<00:00:11.790> which

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
be able to express the impedance which

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.890 
be able to express the impedance which
is<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:12.750> opposition<00:00:13.049> to<00:00:13.500> current<00:00:13.980> of

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:14.900 
is the opposition to current of

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.689 
is the opposition to current of
inductors<00:00:15.900> and<00:00:16.049> capacitors<00:00:16.109> in<00:00:16.859> terms<00:00:17.460> of

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
inductors and capacitors in terms of

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.400 
inductors and capacitors in terms of
what<00:00:17.850> we<00:00:17.940> call<00:00:18.150> complex<00:00:18.539> numbers<00:00:19.170> if<00:00:19.320> you

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
what we call complex numbers if you

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.779 
what we call complex numbers if you
remember<00:00:19.770> what<00:00:19.920> complex<00:00:20.340> numbers<00:00:20.640> are

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
remember what complex numbers are

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.150 
remember what complex numbers are
complex<00:00:21.119> numbers<00:00:21.630> have<00:00:21.810> a<00:00:21.869> real<00:00:22.140> part<00:00:22.529> and<00:00:22.740> an

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
complex numbers have a real part and an

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.730 
complex numbers have a real part and an
imaginary<00:00:23.279> part<00:00:24.090> so<00:00:24.600> if<00:00:24.750> you<00:00:24.900> assume<00:00:25.230> that<00:00:25.260> the

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
imaginary part so if you assume that the

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.640 
imaginary part so if you assume that the
horizontal<00:00:26.070> axis<00:00:26.849> is<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.359> axis<00:00:27.390> of<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:28.019> real

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
horizontal axis is the axis of the real

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.349 
horizontal axis is the axis of the real
numbers<00:00:29.070> called<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.550> number<00:00:29.880> line<00:00:30.060> which

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
numbers called the number line which

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.299 
numbers called the number line which
represents<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.050> real<00:00:31.230> numbers<00:00:31.590> then<00:00:32.009> any

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
represents the real numbers then any

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.430 
represents the real numbers then any
number<00:00:32.700> sets<00:00:32.940> of<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.420> axis<00:00:33.809> above<00:00:34.079> or<00:00:34.290> below

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
number sets of the axis above or below

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.459 
number sets of the axis above or below
the<00:00:34.770> axis<00:00:34.950> is<00:00:35.430> an<00:00:36.149> imaginary<00:00:36.809> number<00:00:37.230> so<00:00:37.260> it

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
the axis is an imaginary number so it

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.920 
the axis is an imaginary number so it
has<00:00:37.620> an<00:00:37.770> imaginary<00:00:38.340> part<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.120> so<00:00:39.690> in<00:00:39.809> this

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
has an imaginary part and so in this

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.869 
has an imaginary part and so in this
particular<00:00:40.110> case<00:00:40.469> let's<00:00:40.950> say<00:00:41.100> that<00:00:41.280> this

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
particular case let's say that this

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.850 
particular case let's say that this
complex<00:00:42.360> number<00:00:42.600> has<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:42.899> real<00:00:43.200> part<00:00:43.530> which<00:00:43.710> is

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
complex number has a real part which is

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.580 
complex number has a real part which is
equal<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.129> 3<00:00:44.520> 1<00:00:45.030> 2<00:00:45.239> 3<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:45.719> has<00:00:45.870> an<00:00:46.050> imaginary

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
equal to 3 1 2 3 and has an imaginary

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.459 
equal to 3 1 2 3 and has an imaginary
part<00:00:46.920> which<00:00:47.129> is<00:00:47.160> equal<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.670> 2i<00:00:47.940> now<00:00:48.780> I<00:00:48.809> is<00:00:49.110> the

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
part which is equal to 2i now I is the

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.889 
part which is equal to 2i now I is the
square<00:00:49.860> root<00:00:49.980> of<00:00:50.160> negative<00:00:50.340> 1<00:00:50.820> which<00:00:51.360> causes

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
square root of negative 1 which causes

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.779 
square root of negative 1 which causes
to<00:00:52.020> be<00:00:52.050> an<00:00:52.469> imaginary<00:00:53.160> number<00:00:53.489> because

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
to be an imaginary number because

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.310 
to be an imaginary number because
there's<00:00:54.000> really<00:00:54.239> no<00:00:54.480> such<00:00:54.690> thing<00:00:54.719> as<00:00:55.199> the

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
there's really no such thing as the

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.139 
there's really no such thing as the
square<00:00:55.649> root<00:00:55.770> of<00:00:55.890> negative<00:00:56.039> 1<00:00:56.460> but<00:00:56.910> it's<00:00:57.059> a

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
square root of negative 1 but it's a

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.000 
square root of negative 1 but it's a
really<00:00:57.329> handy<00:00:57.750> tool<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.199> help<00:00:58.350> us<00:00:58.559> figure<00:00:58.770> out

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
really handy tool to help us figure out

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.130 
really handy tool to help us figure out
how<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.520> write<00:00:59.760> a<00:00:59.820> complex<00:01:00.359> number<00:01:00.600> something

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
how to write a complex number something

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.439 
how to write a complex number something
with<00:01:01.260> an<00:01:01.379> imaginary<00:01:01.920> part<00:01:02.309> so<00:01:02.969> we<00:01:03.120> can<00:01:03.270> write

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
with an imaginary part so we can write

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.420 
with an imaginary part so we can write
this<00:01:03.570> as<00:01:03.750> 3<00:01:03.780> plus<00:01:04.199> 2i<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:05.010> would<00:01:05.129> be<00:01:05.250> this

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
this as 3 plus 2i that would be this

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.120 
this as 3 plus 2i that would be this
number<00:01:05.729> right<00:01:05.909> there<00:01:05.939> off<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.420> number<00:01:07.229> line<00:01:07.409> 2

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
number right there off the number line 2

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.039 
number right there off the number line 2
units<00:01:08.490> away<00:01:08.729> from<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:09.119> number<00:01:09.479> line<00:01:09.659> so<00:01:09.689> the

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
units away from the number line so the

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.500 
units away from the number line so the
imaginary<00:01:10.560> part<00:01:10.890> has<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.400> magnitude<00:01:12.150> or<00:01:12.390> an

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
imaginary part has a magnitude or an

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.100 
imaginary part has a magnitude or an
amplitude<00:01:12.930> of<00:01:13.080> 2<00:01:13.409> units<00:01:13.860> so<00:01:14.670> let's<00:01:15.390> now<00:01:15.570> see

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
amplitude of 2 units so let's now see

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.140 
amplitude of 2 units so let's now see
how<00:01:16.140> we<00:01:16.350> can<00:01:16.590> relate<00:01:16.860> that<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.310> our<00:01:17.729> RCL

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
how we can relate that to our RCL

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.789 
how we can relate that to our RCL
circuit<00:01:18.570> now<00:01:18.750> here<00:01:19.020> we<00:01:19.110> have<00:01:19.140> an<00:01:19.350> inductor

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
circuit now here we have an inductor

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.710 
circuit now here we have an inductor
usually<00:01:20.340> inductors<00:01:20.759> have<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:20.970> small<00:01:21.330> amount<00:01:21.540> of

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
usually inductors have a small amount of

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.510 
usually inductors have a small amount of
resistance<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.470> them<00:01:22.650> because<00:01:22.979> an<00:01:23.130> inductor

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
resistance to them because an inductor

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.670 
resistance to them because an inductor
is<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.700> long<00:01:23.970> wire<00:01:24.270> that's<00:01:24.540> coiled<00:01:24.990> up<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.259> a

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
is a long wire that's coiled up and a

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.020 
is a long wire that's coiled up and a
long<00:01:25.860> piece<00:01:26.070> of<00:01:26.100> wire<00:01:26.340> does<00:01:26.640> have<00:01:26.820> some

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
long piece of wire does have some

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.330 
long piece of wire does have some
resistance<00:01:27.330> so<00:01:28.049> let's<00:01:28.290> call<00:01:28.470> that<00:01:28.650> R<00:01:28.950> sub<00:01:29.189> L

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
resistance so let's call that R sub L

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.969 
resistance so let's call that R sub L
for<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.759> resistance<00:01:30.540> of<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:31.320> inductor<00:01:31.350> and

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
for the resistance of the inductor and

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.469 
for the resistance of the inductor and
of<00:01:32.130> course<00:01:32.310> then<00:01:32.460> we<00:01:32.490> have<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.820> inductor<00:01:33.210> part

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
of course then we have the inductor part

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.510 
of course then we have the inductor part
as<00:01:33.600> well<00:01:33.750> we<00:01:34.290> still<00:01:34.500> have<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.650> resistor<00:01:35.189> here<00:01:35.220> we

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
as well we still have a resistor here we

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.219 
as well we still have a resistor here we
still<00:01:35.700> have<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:35.909> capacitor<00:01:36.450> but<00:01:36.840> let's<00:01:37.079> only

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
still have a capacitor but let's only

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.740 
still have a capacitor but let's only
concentrate<00:01:37.920> on<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.250> inductor<00:01:38.579> in<00:01:38.909> this<00:01:39.479> case

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
concentrate on the inductor in this case

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.359 
concentrate on the inductor in this case
the<00:01:39.990> opposition<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.860> current<00:01:41.159> of<00:01:41.220> the

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
the opposition to the current of the

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.550 
the opposition to the current of the
inductor<00:01:41.790> is<00:01:41.909> 50<00:01:42.540> ohms<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:43.049> then<00:01:43.439> the

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
inductor is 50 ohms and then the

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.920 
inductor is 50 ohms and then the
resistance<00:01:43.890> of<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.369> inductor<00:01:44.399> R<00:01:44.939> sub<00:01:45.210> L<00:01:45.329> is<00:01:45.360> 20

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
resistance of the inductor R sub L is 20

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.840 
resistance of the inductor R sub L is 20
ohms<00:01:46.110> now<00:01:46.799> we<00:01:46.860> don't<00:01:47.159> really<00:01:47.280> talk<00:01:47.790> about

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
ohms now we don't really talk about

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.300 
ohms now we don't really talk about
resistance<00:01:48.720> of<00:01:49.229> an<00:01:49.380> inductor<00:01:49.860> we<00:01:49.979> tend<00:01:50.220> to

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
resistance of an inductor we tend to

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.550 
resistance of an inductor we tend to
talk<00:01:50.460> about<00:01:50.520> about<00:01:51.329> it<00:01:51.540> as<00:01:51.720> in<00:01:52.110> terms<00:01:52.320> of

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
talk about about it as in terms of

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.850 
talk about about it as in terms of
reactance<00:01:53.250> so<00:01:53.790> we<00:01:53.880> call<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.810> axis<00:01:55.409> we<00:01:55.560> call<00:01:55.710> we

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
reactance so we call the axis we call we

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.770 
reactance so we call the axis we call we
use<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.070> letter<00:01:56.189> X<00:01:56.430> we<00:01:56.729> call<00:01:56.939> that<00:01:57.090> reactance

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
use the letter X we call that reactance

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.480 
use the letter X we call that reactance
and<00:01:58.049> it's<00:02:00.290> something<00:02:01.290> like<00:02:01.619> resistance<00:02:02.280> it

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
and it's something like resistance it

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.639 
and it's something like resistance it
has<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.820> same<00:02:03.030> units<00:02:03.270> as<00:02:03.540> resistance<00:02:04.140> but<00:02:04.500> the

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
has the same units as resistance but the

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.440 
has the same units as resistance but the
reason<00:02:04.979> why<00:02:05.100> we<00:02:05.250> call<00:02:05.460> a<00:02:05.490> reactance<00:02:06.119> because

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
reason why we call a reactance because

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.779 
reason why we call a reactance because
it<00:02:06.600> reacts<00:02:07.229> to<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.710> time<00:02:08.190> varying<00:02:08.759> voltage

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
it reacts to the time varying voltage

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.580 
it reacts to the time varying voltage
from<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.539> source<00:02:09.810> so<00:02:09.899> this<00:02:10.170> is<00:02:10.289> a<00:02:10.349> voltage

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
from the source so this is a voltage

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.070 
from the source so this is a voltage
from<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.069> source<00:02:11.340> and<00:02:11.610> as<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.300> source

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
from the source and as the source

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.260 
from the source and as the source
changes<00:02:13.620> over<00:02:13.860> time<00:02:14.100> because<00:02:14.580> it<00:02:14.730> oscillates

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
changes over time because it oscillates

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.110 
changes over time because it oscillates
between<00:02:15.450> Max<00:02:15.900> and<00:02:16.170> min<00:02:16.350> then<00:02:17.280> it<00:02:17.550> reacts

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
between Max and min then it reacts

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.090 
between Max and min then it reacts
changing<00:02:18.930> voltage<00:02:19.290> source<00:02:19.500> therefore<00:02:19.860> we

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
changing voltage source therefore we

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.280 
changing voltage source therefore we
call<00:02:20.310> a<00:02:20.370> reactance<00:02:21.090> but<00:02:21.570> it's<00:02:21.720> kind<00:02:22.080> of<00:02:22.140> like

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
call a reactance but it's kind of like

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.110 
call a reactance but it's kind of like
resistance<00:02:22.800> so<00:02:22.920> think<00:02:23.130> of<00:02:23.250> reactance<00:02:23.850> kind<00:02:24.060> of

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
resistance so think of reactance kind of

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.110 
resistance so think of reactance kind of
like<00:02:24.240> resistance<00:02:24.800> but<00:02:25.940> reactance<00:02:26.940> is

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
like resistance but reactance is

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.450 
like resistance but reactance is
considered<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:27.840> imaginary<00:02:28.590> part<00:02:28.950> of<00:02:29.160> the

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
considered the imaginary part of the

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.550 
considered the imaginary part of the
total<00:02:29.880> opposition<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:30.630> current<00:02:31.020> so<00:02:31.410> we're

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
total opposition to the current so we're

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.260 
total opposition to the current so we're
going<00:02:31.680> to<00:02:31.830> write<00:02:32.100> the<00:02:32.310> total<00:02:32.520> opposition<00:02:32.880> to

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
going to write the total opposition to

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.600 
going to write the total opposition to
the<00:02:33.360> current<00:02:33.720> in<00:02:33.840> terms<00:02:34.350> of<00:02:34.590> a<00:02:34.680> complex<00:02:35.130> number

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
the current in terms of a complex number

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.300 
the current in terms of a complex number
and<00:02:35.790> we're<00:02:36.150> going<00:02:36.330> to<00:02:36.390> call<00:02:36.660> it<00:02:36.870> impedance<00:02:37.740> so

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
and we're going to call it impedance so

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.200 
and we're going to call it impedance so
Z<00:02:38.970> which<00:02:39.690> is<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:40.770> term<00:02:41.100> again<00:02:41.610> it's<00:02:42.030> another

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
Z which is the term again it's another

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.540 
Z which is the term again it's another
term<00:02:42.690> it's<00:02:42.960> again<00:02:43.290> opposition<00:02:44.100> to<00:02:44.220> current

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
term it's again opposition to current

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.250 
term it's again opposition to current
but<00:02:44.730> it's<00:02:44.850> a<00:02:44.910> combination<00:02:45.510> of<00:02:45.600> the<00:02:45.780> real<00:02:45.990> and

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
but it's a combination of the real and

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.830 
but it's a combination of the real and
imaginary<00:02:46.350> part<00:02:47.190> together<00:02:47.400> so<00:02:48.210> the<00:02:48.420> impedance

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
imaginary part together so the impedance

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.790 
imaginary part together so the impedance
of<00:02:49.400> a<00:02:50.400> component<00:02:51.020> against<00:02:52.020> the<00:02:52.140> current<00:02:52.530> flow

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
of a component against the current flow

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.360 
of a component against the current flow
is<00:02:53.070> equal<00:02:53.760> to<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.720> real<00:02:55.470> part<00:02:55.530> of<00:02:56.160> the

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
is equal to the real part of the

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.520 
is equal to the real part of the
impedance<00:02:56.820> which<00:02:56.880> is<00:02:57.030> the<00:02:57.270> resistance<00:02:57.810> plus

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
impedance which is the resistance plus

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.010 
impedance which is the resistance plus
the<00:02:58.800> imaginary<00:02:59.280> part<00:03:00.000> of<00:03:00.150> the<00:03:00.300> opposition

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
the imaginary part of the opposition

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.470 
the imaginary part of the opposition
which<00:03:01.410> is<00:03:01.590> the<00:03:01.740> reactance<00:03:02.280> so<00:03:02.760> the<00:03:02.970> impedance

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
which is the reactance so the impedance

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.150 
which is the reactance so the impedance
is<00:03:03.660> the<00:03:03.840> sum<00:03:04.080> of<00:03:04.110> the<00:03:04.350> real<00:03:04.530> part<00:03:04.920> and<00:03:05.070> the

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
is the sum of the real part and the

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.699 
is the sum of the real part and the
imaginary<00:03:05.610> part<00:03:06.420> again<00:03:06.750> I<00:03:06.900> is<00:03:07.080> the<00:03:07.440> square

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
imaginary part again I is the square

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.380 
imaginary part again I is the square
root<00:03:07.800> of<00:03:07.860> negative<00:03:07.980> 1<00:03:08.400> and<00:03:08.640> so<00:03:09.000> that<00:03:09.030> again

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
root of negative 1 and so that again

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.570 
root of negative 1 and so that again
it's<00:03:09.600> one<00:03:09.810> of<00:03:09.930> those<00:03:09.990> complex<00:03:10.530> numbers<00:03:10.980> so<00:03:11.459> in

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
it's one of those complex numbers so in

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.790 
it's one of those complex numbers so in
the<00:03:11.640> case<00:03:11.850> of<00:03:11.880> this<00:03:12.180> particular<00:03:12.420> inductor<00:03:13.350> we

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
the case of this particular inductor we

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.890 
the case of this particular inductor we
can<00:03:13.830> say<00:03:14.160> that<00:03:14.400> the<00:03:14.850> impedance<00:03:15.450> of<00:03:15.750> the

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
can say that the impedance of the

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.930 
can say that the impedance of the
inductor<00:03:15.930> is<00:03:16.530> equal<00:03:16.950> to<00:03:17.070> the<00:03:17.220> resistance<00:03:17.550> of

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
inductor is equal to the resistance of

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.780 
inductor is equal to the resistance of
the<00:03:18.030> inductor<00:03:18.060> plus<00:03:19.050> I<00:03:19.200> times<00:03:19.709> the<00:03:19.980> reactance

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
the inductor plus I times the reactance

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.420 
the inductor plus I times the reactance
of<00:03:20.850> the<00:03:21.390> inductor<00:03:22.140> and<00:03:22.380> we<00:03:22.500> call<00:03:22.680> that<00:03:22.709> X<00:03:23.070> sub<00:03:23.280> L

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
of the inductor and we call that X sub L

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.540 
of the inductor and we call that X sub L
so<00:03:23.940> in<00:03:24.060> this<00:03:24.180> case<00:03:24.480> we<00:03:25.050> can<00:03:25.260> see<00:03:25.410> that<00:03:25.590> Z<00:03:26.130> sub<00:03:26.400> L

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
so in this case we can see that Z sub L

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.509 
so in this case we can see that Z sub L
is<00:03:26.820> equal<00:03:27.390> to<00:03:27.420> 20<00:03:28.019> ohms<00:03:28.260> that's<00:03:28.739> the<00:03:28.920> real<00:03:29.130> part

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
is equal to 20 ohms that's the real part

we're going to draw that on a graph it

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.360 
we're going to draw that on a graph it
would<00:03:47.580> look<00:03:47.760> like<00:03:47.910> this<00:03:49.250> notice<00:03:50.250> the

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.690 
real part so that lets say it's 10 20
ohms<00:04:03.540> right<00:04:03.840> there<00:04:04.140> 20<00:04:04.709> ohms<00:04:04.890> and<00:04:05.190> then<00:04:05.610> we

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
ohms right there 20 ohms and then we

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.750 
ohms right there 20 ohms and then we
have<00:04:05.820> 50<00:04:06.239> ohms<00:04:06.420> in<00:04:06.750> the<00:04:07.290> positive<00:04:07.760> y-direction

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
have 50 ohms in the positive y-direction

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.300 
have 50 ohms in the positive y-direction
so<00:04:09.420> to<00:04:09.480> speak<00:04:09.720> or<00:04:09.870> the<00:04:09.900> positive<00:04:10.310> reactance

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.949 
so to speak or the positive reactance
direction<00:04:11.820> so<00:04:12.180> that's<00:04:12.299> 10<00:04:12.690> 20<00:04:13.320> 30<00:04:13.709> 40<00:04:14.310> 50<00:04:14.959> there

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:17.840 
direction so that's 10 20 30 40 50 there
we<00:04:16.080> go<00:04:16.260> and<00:04:16.500> then<00:04:16.919> when<00:04:17.070> we<00:04:17.160> combine<00:04:17.489> these<00:04:17.640> two

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
we go and then when we combine these two

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.460 
we go and then when we combine these two
together<00:04:18.320> there<00:04:19.320> they<00:04:19.680> meet<00:04:20.100> right<00:04:20.310> there<00:04:20.580> and

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
together there they meet right there and

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.210 
together there they meet right there and
this<00:04:21.680> here<00:04:22.280> is<00:04:22.700> what<00:04:23.450> we<00:04:23.570> call<00:04:23.960> the<00:04:24.620> impedance

inductor all right and that's how we

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.130 
inductor all right and that's how we
look<00:04:37.640> at<00:04:37.790> impedance<00:04:38.390> and<00:04:38.540> that's<00:04:38.930> how<00:04:39.080> we

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
of the opposite side which would be the

imaginary<00:04:56.870> part<00:04:57.260> that<00:04:57.560> would<00:04:58.070> be<00:04:58.250> X<00:04:59.080> divided

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
imaginary part that would be X divided

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.620 
imaginary part that would be X divided
by<00:05:00.110> the<00:05:00.290> horizontal<00:05:00.800> side<00:05:01.640> which<00:05:02.000> is<00:05:02.180> the<00:05:02.360> real

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630

by the horizontal side which is the real
part<00:05:02.930> R<00:05:03.580> so<00:05:04.580> in<00:05:04.670> this<00:05:04.790> case<00:05:05.120> the<00:05:05.360> phase<00:05:05.540> angle

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 
part R so in this case the phase angle

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.370 
part R so in this case the phase angle
would<00:05:06.110> be<00:05:06.140> the<00:05:06.320> arctangent<00:05:06.950> of<00:05:07.660> the<00:05:08.660> reactance

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.380 
would be the arctangent of the reactance

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.500 
would be the arctangent of the reactance
which<00:05:09.590> is<00:05:09.740> 50<00:05:10.100> ohms<00:05:10.280> divided<00:05:11.210> by<00:05:11.450> the

which is 50 ohms divided by the

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.170 
which is 50 ohms divided by the
resistance<00:05:12.350> which<00:05:12.560> is<00:05:12.590> 20<00:05:13.040> ohms<00:05:13.220> and<00:05:13.550> so<00:05:14.060> it

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.180 
resistance which is 20 ohms and so it

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.750 
resistance which is 20 ohms and so it
simply<00:05:14.480> would<00:05:14.630> be<00:05:14.750> the<00:05:14.870> arctangent<00:05:15.290> of<00:05:15.760> 50

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760 
simply would be the arctangent of 50

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
simply would be the arctangent of 50
over<00:05:17.000> 20<00:05:17.390> on<00:05:17.870> the<00:05:18.050> suta<00:05:18.350> at<00:05:18.500> 50<00:05:19.270> 50<00:05:20.270> divided<00:05:20.750> by

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:20.780 
over 20 on the suta at 50 50 divided by

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:23.560 
over 20 on the suta at 50 50 divided by
20<00:05:21.350> to<00:05:21.890> our<00:05:22.190> tension<00:05:22.490> of<00:05:22.760> that<00:05:22.790> and<00:05:23.180> it<00:05:23.450> would

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:23.570 
20 to our tension of that and it would

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:26.200 
20 to our tension of that and it would
be<00:05:23.720> sixty<00:05:24.290> eight<00:05:24.440> point<00:05:24.740> two<00:05:25.040> degrees<00:05:25.400> so<00:05:26.000> that

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 
be sixty eight point two degrees so that

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.560 
be sixty eight point two degrees so that
phase<00:05:26.450> angle<00:05:26.840> in<00:05:26.900> this<00:05:27.050> case<00:05:27.110> is<00:05:27.610> 68<00:05:28.610> point<00:05:29.240> two

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:29.570 
phase angle in this case is 68 point two

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:31.630 
phase angle in this case is 68 point two

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:31.640 
degrees and how do we find that by

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.810 
degrees and how do we find that by
simply<00:05:32.090> drawing<00:05:32.510> the<00:05:33.610> resistance<00:05:34.610> and

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:34.820 
simply drawing the resistance and

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:37.150 
simply drawing the resistance and
reactance<00:05:35.210> of<00:05:35.660> the<00:05:35.780> circuit<00:05:36.169> in<00:05:36.290> terms<00:05:36.350> of<00:05:37.040> a

reactance of the circuit in terms of a
complex<00:05:37.669> number<00:05:37.820> and<00:05:38.240> not<00:05:38.690> knowing<00:05:39.110> that<00:05:39.320> this

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 
complex number and not knowing that this

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.460 
complex number and not knowing that this
diagonal<00:05:40.190> right<00:05:40.340> here<00:05:40.760> the<00:05:41.150> vector<00:05:41.750> sum<00:05:42.200> in<00:05:42.410> a

imaginary<00:05:44.960> part<00:05:45.740> combined<00:05:46.280> gives<00:05:46.880> you<00:05:47.000> the

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 
imaginary part combined gives you the

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.150 
imaginary part combined gives you the
impedance<00:05:47.690> or<00:05:47.900> the<00:05:48.050> total<00:05:48.320> opposition<00:05:49.010> of

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:49.160 
impedance or the total opposition of

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.430 
impedance or the total opposition of
that<00:05:49.669> particular<00:05:49.970> component<00:05:50.390> and<00:05:50.780> so<00:05:51.229> that's

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440 
that particular component and so that's

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:55.270 
that particular component and so that's
the<00:05:51.620> idea<00:05:51.979> of<00:05:52.100> using<00:05:52.370> complex<00:05:52.970> numbers<00:05:53.680> in<00:05:54.680> the

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:55.280 
the idea of using complex numbers in the

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.659 
the idea of using complex numbers in the
X<00:05:55.640> in<00:05:56.150> the<00:05:56.210> X<00:05:56.570> in<00:05:56.780> the<00:05:57.080> representation<00:05:58.070> and

00:05:58.659 --> 00:05:58.669 
X in the X in the representation and

00:05:58.669 --> 00:05:59.950 
X in the X in the representation and
thus<00:05:58.820> the<00:05:58.910> word<00:05:59.060> I<00:05:59.120> was<00:05:59.210> looking<00:05:59.270> for<00:05:59.660> in<00:05:59.840> the

00:05:59.950 --> 00:05:59.960 
thus the word I was looking for in the

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.500 
thus the word I was looking for in the
representation<00:06:00.320> of<00:06:00.740> how<00:06:01.310> we<00:06:01.370> represent<00:06:01.700> the

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:02.510 
representation of how we represent the

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:04.780 
representation of how we represent the
opposition<00:06:03.169> of<00:06:03.320> these<00:06:03.560> components<00:06:04.250> to<00:06:04.669> the

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:04.790 
opposition of these components to the

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:07.060 
opposition of these components to the
current<00:06:05.150> flow<00:06:05.390> or<00:06:05.419> to<00:06:05.810> the<00:06:05.930> voltage<00:06:06.260> source<00:06:06.530> by

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:07.070 
current flow or to the voltage source by

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:09.969 
current flow or to the voltage source by
turning<00:06:07.610> the<00:06:07.870> opposition<00:06:08.870> writing<00:06:09.680> in<00:06:09.770> terms

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:09.979 
turning the opposition writing in terms

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:12.190 
turning the opposition writing in terms
of<00:06:10.190> the<00:06:10.400> imaginary<00:06:10.970> part<00:06:11.300> reactance<00:06:11.900> the<00:06:11.990> real

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:12.200 
of the imaginary part reactance the real

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.590 
of the imaginary part reactance the real
part<00:06:12.500> resistance<00:06:13.070> and<00:06:13.250> combined<00:06:13.940> we<00:06:14.360> call

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:14.600 
part resistance and combined we call

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.240 
part resistance and combined we call
that<00:06:14.780> the<00:06:14.840> impedance<00:06:15.290> which<00:06:15.919> is<00:06:16.100> now

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:16.250 
that the impedance which is now

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.219 
that the impedance which is now
represented<00:06:17.120> by<00:06:17.150> a<00:06:17.300> complex<00:06:17.960> number

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:18.229 
represented by a complex number

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:20.110 
represented by a complex number
indicating<00:06:19.070> the<00:06:19.160> opposition<00:06:19.729> to<00:06:19.850> the<00:06:19.940> current
