however<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:09.630> want<00:01:09.810> it<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:10.110> have<00:01:10.439> beaten<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.250> set

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
however you want it I have beaten a set

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.090 
however you want it I have beaten a set
on<00:01:11.580> Z<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.119> X<00:01:12.380> because<00:01:13.380> I<00:01:13.500> just<00:01:13.680> that's<00:01:13.860> just

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
on Z and X because I just that's just

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.609 
on Z and X because I just that's just
the<00:01:14.189> best<00:01:14.310> I<00:01:14.750> think<00:01:15.750> that's<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.259> best<00:01:16.409> way<00:01:16.590> to

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
the best I think that's the best way to

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.240 
the best I think that's the best way to
do<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:17.630> or<00:01:18.630> you<00:01:19.140> could<00:01:19.320> put<00:01:19.650> on<00:01:19.770> any<00:01:20.040> of<00:01:20.100> those

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
do it or you could put on any of those

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.710 
do it or you could put on any of those
keys<00:01:20.490> it<00:01:20.759> doesn't<00:01:21.000> really<00:01:21.150> matter<00:01:21.360> just<00:01:21.630> like

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
keys it doesn't really matter just like

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:32.109 
keys it doesn't really matter just like
you<00:01:24.720> move<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.259> little<00:01:25.880> letter<00:01:26.880> around<00:01:29.270> so

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
you move the little letter around so

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.840 
you move the little letter around so
once<00:01:33.119> you<00:01:33.210> do<00:01:33.360> that<00:01:33.390> you<00:01:33.780> just<00:01:34.340> pretty<00:01:35.340> easy

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
once you do that you just pretty easy

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.719 
once you do that you just pretty easy
enter<00:01:36.659> start<00:01:37.110> unless<00:01:37.409> you<00:01:37.740> change<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.460> the

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
enter start unless you change it and the

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.990 
enter start unless you change it and the
arrow<00:01:38.909> keys<00:01:39.180> move<00:01:39.420> unless<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.290> change<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:42.079> so

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
arrow keys move unless you change it so

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.780 
arrow keys move unless you change it so
I'll<00:01:45.000> let's<00:01:45.210> play<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.420> little<00:01:45.659> bit<00:01:46.549> the<00:01:47.549> color

is<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.119> little<00:01:48.180> light<00:01:48.570> but<00:01:49.439> I<00:01:49.470> could<00:01:49.649> probably

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
is a little light but I could probably

00:01:49.829 --> 00:02:04.120 
is a little light but I could probably
change<00:01:50.040> that<00:01:50.189> I<00:01:50.340> haven't<00:01:50.549> really<00:01:50.729> tried
