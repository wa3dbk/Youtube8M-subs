00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.790 
person ID does that shoots who gun
obviously<00:00:24.089> but<00:00:24.539> this<00:00:24.810> picture<00:00:25.079> here<00:00:25.410> you<00:00:25.529> see

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
obviously but this picture here you see

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.859 
obviously but this picture here you see
it's<00:00:25.890> got<00:00:25.980> firing<00:00:26.519> each<00:00:26.759> individual<00:00:27.599> bullet

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
it's got firing each individual bullet

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.050 
it's got firing each individual bullet
down<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.499> the<00:00:28.619> frames<00:00:28.949> so<00:00:29.460> it<00:00:29.519> takes<00:00:29.699> four

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
down to the frames so it takes four

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.300 
down to the frames so it takes four
frames<00:00:30.359> for<00:00:30.749> a<00:00:31.140> bullet<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:31.919> come<00:00:32.099> out

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:32.310 
frames for a bullet to come out

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.040 
frames for a bullet to come out
basically<00:00:32.970> the<00:00:33.060> bullet<00:00:33.270> doesn't<00:00:33.450> damage<00:00:33.720> and

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
basically the bullet doesn't damage and

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.810 
basically the bullet doesn't damage and
then<00:00:34.140> in<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.350> next<00:00:34.500> three<00:00:34.860> frames<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.610> cool

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
then in the next three frames the cool

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.130 
then in the next three frames the cool
down<00:00:35.970> which<00:00:36.180> is<00:00:36.330> what<00:00:36.450> this<00:00:36.600> reads<00:00:36.840> strippers

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
down which is what this reads strippers

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.660 
down which is what this reads strippers
so<00:00:37.620> you<00:00:37.680> go<00:00:37.770> through<00:00:37.920> those<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.460> that's<00:00:38.610> a

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
so you go through those and that's a

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.340 
so you go through those and that's a
burst<00:00:38.880> after<00:00:39.150> that<00:00:39.810> you<00:00:39.930> have<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.080> burst

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
burst after that you have the burst

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.050 
burst after that you have the burst
cooldown<00:00:40.770> which<00:00:40.920> is<00:00:41.040> approximately<00:00:41.280> 12

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:42.060 
cooldown which is approximately 12

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.030 
cooldown which is approximately 12
frames<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:43.050> this<00:00:43.200> game<00:00:43.350> if<00:00:43.530> you<00:00:43.620> press<00:00:43.860> are

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
frames and this game if you press are

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.120 
frames and this game if you press are

what'll happen is will come out right
down<00:00:53.790> here<00:00:54.000> so<00:00:54.180> it'll<00:00:54.600> come<00:00:54.750> out<00:00:54.900> after<00:00:55.020> the

and third it creates the reload much the
reload<00:01:32.939> is<00:01:33.090> completely<00:01:33.569> invisible<00:01:33.780> but<00:01:34.439> the

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
reload is completely invisible but the

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.039 
reload is completely invisible but the
effect<00:01:35.549> is<00:01:35.759> exactly<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.389> same<00:01:36.630> so<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:36.869> get

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
effect is exactly the same so you get

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.690 
effect is exactly the same so you get
two<00:01:37.289> things<00:01:37.319> going<00:01:37.829> on<00:01:37.889> at<00:01:38.009> once<00:01:38.189> you<00:01:38.460> get<00:01:38.609> the

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
two things going on at once you get the

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.660 
two things going on at once you get the
shot<00:01:38.999> but<00:01:39.149> you<00:01:39.299> also<00:01:39.509> reload<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:41.310> notice<00:01:41.549> down

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
shot but you also reload you notice down

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.160 
shot but you also reload you notice down
the<00:01:41.759> bottom<00:01:41.819> here<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:42.240> this<00:01:42.479> popped<00:01:42.749> up<00:01:42.869> hole

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
the bottom here that this popped up hole

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.870 
the bottom here that this popped up hole
so<00:01:43.649> I<00:01:43.679> used<00:01:43.859> to<00:01:43.920> play<00:01:44.009> pretty<00:01:44.340> damn<00:01:44.490> computer

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
so I used to play pretty damn computer

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.209 
so I used to play pretty damn computer
to<00:01:44.999> me<00:01:45.149> back<00:01:45.329> in<00:01:45.450> 2006<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.439> someone<00:01:47.039> I<00:01:47.159> don't

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:47.219 
to me back in 2006 and someone I don't

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:49.099 
to me back in 2006 and someone I don't
know<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:47.490> was<00:01:47.639> told<00:01:47.880> me<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.359> hold<00:01:48.569> the<00:01:48.810> second

00:01:49.099 --> 00:01:49.109 
know it was told me to hold the second

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:50.959 
know it was told me to hold the second
eye<00:01:49.200> down<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.649> press<00:01:49.799> X<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.280> holy<00:01:50.520> shit<00:01:50.939> that

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:50.969 
eye down and press X and holy shit that

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:51.889 
eye down and press X and holy shit that
was<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.299> lifesaver

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
was the lifesaver

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.389 
was the lifesaver
I<00:01:51.929> don't<00:01:52.170> know<00:01:52.259> why<00:01:52.439> but<00:01:52.770> it's<00:01:53.069> holding<00:01:53.310> that

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
I don't know why but it's holding that

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.399 
I don't know why but it's holding that
identity<00:01:53.969> you<00:01:54.060> press<00:01:54.270> X<00:01:54.509> just<00:01:54.810> works<00:01:55.139> really

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
identity you press X just works really

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.080 
identity you press X just works really
well<00:01:55.649> you<00:01:55.979> can't<00:01:56.219> do<00:01:56.399> it<00:01:56.490> without<00:01:56.549> holding<00:01:56.819> it

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
well you can't do it without holding it

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.489 
well you can't do it without holding it
but<00:01:57.270> it<00:01:57.389> just<00:01:57.539> seems<00:01:57.749> to<00:01:57.869> be<00:01:58.079> way<00:01:58.200> harder<00:01:58.380> to

00:01:58.489 --> 00:01:58.499 
but it just seems to be way harder to

00:01:58.499 --> 00:02:00.529 
but it just seems to be way harder to
get<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.709> timing<00:01:58.920> right<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.399> for<00:01:59.819> the<00:01:59.850> Express

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:00.539 
get the timing right and for the Express

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:03.679 
get the timing right and for the Express
it<00:02:00.840> has<00:02:01.079> to<00:02:01.259> be<00:02:01.409> directly<00:02:01.950> on<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.909> 12th<00:02:03.359> frame

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
it has to be directly on the 12th frame

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.230 
it has to be directly on the 12th frame
or<00:02:03.899> 20th<00:02:04.859> of<00:02:04.979> a<00:02:05.100> second<00:02:05.490> that's<00:02:05.759> kind<00:02:06.119> of<00:02:06.149> the

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
or 20th of a second that's kind of the

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.609 
or 20th of a second that's kind of the
earliest<00:02:06.509> you<00:02:06.659> can<00:02:06.779> do<00:02:06.869> it<00:02:06.959> if<00:02:07.139> you<00:02:07.289> do<00:02:07.409> it<00:02:07.499> in

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
earliest you can do it if you do it in

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.559 
earliest you can do it if you do it in
here<00:02:07.859> it<00:02:08.039> tries<00:02:08.310> doing<00:02:08.819> that<00:02:09.030> queued<00:02:09.330> shot

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
here it tries doing that queued shot

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.479 
here it tries doing that queued shot
again<00:02:09.810> so<00:02:10.080> if<00:02:10.170> you<00:02:10.289> press<00:02:10.470> X<00:02:10.739> it'll<00:02:11.280> cancel

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
again so if you press X it'll cancel

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.309 
again so if you press X it'll cancel
this<00:02:11.939> one<00:02:12.180> because<00:02:12.540> first<00:02:12.810> shot<00:02:12.989> is<00:02:13.140> like<00:02:13.290> a

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
this one because first shot is like a

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.140 
this one because first shot is like a
softcore<00:02:13.680> down<00:02:14.010> you<00:02:14.370> can<00:02:14.519> kind<00:02:14.700> of<00:02:14.790> cancel<00:02:15.090> it

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
softcore down you can kind of cancel it

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.369 
softcore down you can kind of cancel it
like<00:02:15.299> if<00:02:15.420> you<00:02:15.510> press

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
like if you press

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:18.559 
like if you press
or<00:02:16.500> melee<00:02:17.069> it'll<00:02:17.670> cancel<00:02:17.879> the<00:02:18.180> third<00:02:18.420> bullet

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
or melee it'll cancel the third bullet

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.059 
or melee it'll cancel the third bullet
so<00:02:18.900> you<00:02:18.959> can<00:02:19.140> shoot<00:02:19.260> just<00:02:19.470> to<00:02:19.620> pull<00:02:19.769> us<00:02:19.860> out<00:02:19.950> of

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
so you can shoot just to pull us out of

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:21.860 
so you can shoot just to pull us out of
a<00:02:20.129> person<00:02:20.549> cancel<00:02:20.849> the<00:02:21.030> reload<00:02:21.299> so<00:02:21.540> if<00:02:21.599> you<00:02:21.689> do

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
a person cancel the reload so if you do

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:22.309 
a person cancel the reload so if you do
there

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
there

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.289 
there
the<00:02:22.470> queued<00:02:22.860> shot<00:02:23.189> will<00:02:23.519> try<00:02:23.760> and<00:02:23.909> come<00:02:24.090> out

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
the queued shot will try and come out

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:26.179 
the queued shot will try and come out
but<00:02:24.510> it<00:02:24.750> won't<00:02:25.140> because<00:02:25.379> that<00:02:25.530> still<00:02:25.829> thinks

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:26.189 
but it won't because that still thinks

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:27.710 
but it won't because that still thinks
that<00:02:26.250> it's<00:02:26.459> shooting<00:02:26.819> and<00:02:27.090> so<00:02:27.209> you<00:02:27.269> just<00:02:27.540> end

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
that it's shooting and so you just end

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.360 
that it's shooting and so you just end
up<00:02:27.780> reloading<00:02:28.290> so<00:02:28.560> yeah<00:02:28.739> make<00:02:29.040> sure<00:02:29.189> it's

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
up reloading so yeah make sure it's

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.100 
up reloading so yeah make sure it's
after<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:29.790> third<00:02:29.970> bullet<00:02:30.150> full<00:02:30.569> timing<00:02:31.019> I

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
after the third bullet full timing I

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.319 
after the third bullet full timing I
just<00:02:31.500> press<00:02:31.829> are<00:02:32.099> as<00:02:32.459> fast<00:02:32.670> as<00:02:32.819> I<00:02:32.909> can<00:02:32.970> hold<00:02:33.239> a

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:33.329 
just press are as fast as I can hold a

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:35.390 
just press are as fast as I can hold a
second<00:02:33.569> went<00:02:33.720> down<00:02:33.840> press<00:02:34.319> X<00:02:34.650> when<00:02:34.980> I<00:02:35.010> think

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
second went down press X when I think

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.069 
second went down press X when I think
the<00:02:35.549> fourth<00:02:35.819> bullet<00:02:36.180> should<00:02:36.510> come<00:02:36.689> out<00:02:36.720> people

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:37.079 
the fourth bullet should come out people

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:38.300 
the fourth bullet should come out people
just<00:02:37.290> go<00:02:37.379> I'll<00:02:37.530> practice<00:02:37.890> a<00:02:37.980> time<00:02:38.159> and

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
just go I'll practice a time and

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.500 
just go I'll practice a time and
practice<00:02:38.400> this<00:02:38.670> time<00:02:38.819> but<00:02:39.000> I<00:02:39.030> what<00:02:39.329> does<00:02:39.420> that

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
practice this time but I what does that

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.979 
practice this time but I what does that
actually<00:02:39.629> mean

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
actually mean

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.119 
actually mean
well<00:02:40.170> here<00:02:40.409> it<00:02:40.500> is<00:02:40.590> right<00:02:40.769> here<00:02:40.859> this<00:02:41.069> is

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
well here it is right here this is

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:43.309 
well here it is right here this is
exactly<00:02:41.579> what<00:02:41.760> I<00:02:41.790> mean<00:02:42.000> so<00:02:42.420> going<00:02:42.780> back<00:02:43.019> to<00:02:43.200> the

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
exactly what I mean so going back to the

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.199 
exactly what I mean so going back to the
reload<00:02:43.739> glitch<00:02:44.010> there<00:02:44.489> is<00:02:44.609> no<00:02:44.730> ideal<00:02:45.000> because

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
reload glitch there is no ideal because

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.089 
reload glitch there is no ideal because
I<00:02:45.780> don't<00:02:46.170> know<00:02:46.230> how<00:02:46.349> long<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.650> reload<00:02:46.920> goes

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
I don't know how long the reload goes

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:48.440 
I don't know how long the reload goes
for<00:02:47.280> I<00:02:47.340> didn't<00:02:47.519> time<00:02:47.700> that<00:02:47.909> this<00:02:48.060> was<00:02:48.209> already

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
for I didn't time that this was already

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.539 
for I didn't time that this was already
a<00:02:48.629> lot<00:02:48.750> of<00:02:48.840> work<00:02:48.989> but<00:02:49.290> basically<00:02:49.650> a<00:02:50.010> reload<00:02:50.400> is

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
a lot of work but basically a reload is

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:51.680 
a lot of work but basically a reload is
through<00:02:50.970> him<00:02:51.060> and<00:02:51.239> you<00:02:51.359> want<00:02:51.420> to<00:02:51.540> be<00:02:51.599> on<00:02:51.659> a

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
through him and you want to be on a

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.000 
through him and you want to be on a
shoot<00:02:51.870> again<00:02:52.079> so<00:02:52.230> if<00:02:52.290> you<00:02:52.379> want<00:02:52.500> to<00:02:52.530> do<00:02:52.650> a<00:02:52.680> quad

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
shoot again so if you want to do a quad

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.190 
shoot again so if you want to do a quad
shot<00:02:53.280> you<00:02:53.519> need<00:02:53.670> to<00:02:53.760> cancel<00:02:54.000> their<00:02:54.329> reload<00:02:54.629> so

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
shot you need to cancel their reload so

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.569 
shot you need to cancel their reload so
that<00:02:55.319> you<00:02:55.379> can<00:02:55.530> start<00:02:55.769> again<00:02:55.859> so<00:02:56.280> that's<00:02:56.400> just

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
that you can start again so that's just

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:59.059 
that you can start again so that's just
simply<00:02:56.730> why<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.420> first<00:02:57.810> one<00:02:57.930> will<00:02:58.319> cancel<00:02:58.590> the

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
simply why the first one will cancel the

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:00.259 
simply why the first one will cancel the
really<00:02:59.340> glitch<00:02:59.549> it's<00:02:59.879> like<00:02:59.970> when<00:03:00.150> you're

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
really glitch it's like when you're

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:01.429 
really glitch it's like when you're
reloading<00:03:00.510> and<00:03:00.689> you<00:03:00.750> change<00:03:00.959> weapons<00:03:01.290> it

00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:01.439 
reloading and you change weapons it

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:02.960 
reloading and you change weapons it
cancels<00:03:01.859> it<00:03:01.950> out<00:03:02.040> and<00:03:02.250> then<00:03:02.459> the<00:03:02.549> second<00:03:02.849> wire

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
cancels it out and then the second wire

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.119 
cancels it out and then the second wire
will<00:03:03.389> change<00:03:03.750> back<00:03:03.959> to<00:03:04.109> your<00:03:04.200> BR<00:03:04.439> but<00:03:04.950> yeah

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:05.129 
will change back to your BR but yeah

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:10.580 
will change back to your BR but yeah
I'll<00:03:05.310> show<00:03:05.639> you<00:03:05.700> guys<00:03:06.060> an<00:03:06.900> action<00:03:09.379> yeah<00:03:10.379> I'll

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:33.419 
and we get across at X and then it

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:35.000 
and we get across at X and then it
allows<00:03:33.599> the<00:03:34.109> fourth<00:03:34.409> bullets<00:03:34.680> to<00:03:34.739> come<00:03:34.859> out

so I start shooting a ball here and he's

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.060 
so I start shooting a ball here and he's
in<00:04:13.660> the<00:04:13.810> window<00:04:14.080> so<00:04:14.290> there's<00:04:14.470> not<00:04:14.560> much<00:04:14.620> aiming

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.070 
in the window so there's not much aiming

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:16.890 
in the window so there's not much aiming
you<00:04:15.130> can<00:04:15.280> do<00:04:15.430> I<00:04:15.610> can<00:04:15.760> only<00:04:15.880> kind<00:04:16.239> of<00:04:16.390> aim<00:04:16.570> around

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900

you can do I can only kind of aim around
this<00:04:17.019> section<00:04:17.230> anyway<00:04:17.590> because<00:04:17.739> he's<00:04:17.920> gonna

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040 
this section anyway because he's gonna
