thousand five percent of that is going

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.530 
thousand five percent of that is going
to<00:01:01.859> be<00:01:01.949> taken<00:01:02.430> as<00:01:02.780> as<00:01:04.610> like<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.640> tax<00:01:06.090> or<00:01:06.360> whether

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
to be taken as as like a tax or whether

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.810 
to be taken as as like a tax or whether
you<00:01:06.659> want<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:06.930> call<00:01:07.110> it<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.439> so<00:01:08.159> ten<00:01:08.400> percent

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
you want to call it and so ten percent

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.100 
you want to call it and so ten percent
of<00:01:08.970> 10,000<00:01:09.960> is<00:01:10.369> 1000<00:01:11.369> so<00:01:11.580> 500<00:01:12.270> is<00:01:12.390> five<00:01:12.720> percent

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
of 10,000 is 1000 so 500 is five percent

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.899 
of 10,000 is 1000 so 500 is five percent
of<00:01:13.290> 10,000<00:01:14.010> so<00:01:14.130> you're<00:01:14.280> going<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.490> lose<00:01:14.610> 500

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
you've got to remember now that you're

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.710 
you've got to remember now that you're
selling<00:01:51.119> for<00:01:51.360> 40,000<00:01:52.079> right<00:01:52.229> now<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:53.720> if

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
selling for 40,000 right now and if

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.240 
selling for 40,000 right now and if
you're<00:01:54.869> selling<00:01:55.110> for<00:01:55.229> 40,000<00:01:55.890> buy<00:01:55.979> it<00:01:56.040> now

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
you're selling for 40,000 buy it now

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.160 
you're selling for 40,000 buy it now
you're<00:01:56.520> going<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.759> lose<00:01:56.880> 5%<00:01:57.360> off<00:01:57.689> your<00:01:57.840> final

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
you're going to lose 5% off your final

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.120 
you're going to lose 5% off your final
price<00:01:58.350> so<00:01:58.680> five<00:01:59.040> percent<00:01:59.490> is<00:01:59.640> going<00:01:59.880> to<00:02:00.030> be<00:02:00.210> and

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
price so five percent is going to be and

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.440 
price so five percent is going to be and
forty<00:02:02.130> thousand<00:02:02.579> ten<00:02:02.729> percent<00:02:03.030> of<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.210> is

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
forty thousand ten percent of that is

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.380 
forty thousand ten percent of that is
4,000<00:02:04.380> so<00:02:04.590> two<00:02:04.649> thousand<00:02:05.399> is<00:02:05.610> five<00:02:05.939> percent

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
4,000 so two thousand is five percent

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.529 
4,000 so two thousand is five percent
five<00:02:06.990> percent<00:02:07.320> of<00:02:07.469> five<00:02:08.429> percent<00:02:08.729> of<00:02:08.849> 40,000

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
five percent of five percent of 40,000

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.460 
five percent of five percent of 40,000
is<00:02:09.720> 2,000<00:02:10.560> okay<00:02:11.430> so<00:02:11.489> now<00:02:12.450> we<00:02:12.510> know<00:02:12.780> that<00:02:12.810> we're

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
is 2,000 okay so now we know that we're

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.640 
is 2,000 okay so now we know that we're
not

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
not

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.649 
not
actually<00:02:13.920> going<00:02:14.010> to<00:02:14.129> getting<00:02:14.569> 40,000<00:02:15.569> we're

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:15.659 
actually going to getting 40,000 we're

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:19.009 
actually going to getting 40,000 we're
going<00:02:15.780> to<00:02:15.840> get<00:02:16.159> 38,000<00:02:17.159> for<00:02:17.670> our<00:02:17.790> player<00:02:18.060> after

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
going to get 38,000 for our player after

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:22.399 
going to get 38,000 for our player after
tax<00:02:19.290> and<00:02:20.209> so<00:02:21.209> that<00:02:21.360> means<00:02:21.569> that<00:02:21.870> you<00:02:22.019> need<00:02:22.230> to

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:22.409 
tax and so that means that you need to

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:24.979 
tax and so that means that you need to
be<00:02:22.439> buying<00:02:22.799> and<00:02:23.159> for<00:02:23.519> less<00:02:23.760> than<00:02:23.970> 38,000<00:02:24.870> you

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
be buying and for less than 38,000 you

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.039 
be buying and for less than 38,000 you
want<00:02:25.170> to<00:02:25.230> sell<00:02:25.379> them<00:02:25.470> at<00:02:25.560> 40,000<00:02:26.430> and<00:02:27.019> what<00:02:28.019> I

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049 
want to sell them at 40,000 and what I

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:29.780 
want to sell them at 40,000 and what I
usually<00:02:28.319> try<00:02:28.620> and<00:02:28.709> do<00:02:28.950> is<00:02:29.129> make<00:02:29.370> sure<00:02:29.400> that<00:02:29.610> i

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
usually try and do is make sure that i

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.399 
usually try and do is make sure that i
buy<00:02:30.030> them<00:02:30.150> for<00:02:30.299> less<00:02:30.480> than<00:02:30.629> ten<00:02:30.870> percents<00:02:31.200> it

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:31.409 
buy them for less than ten percents it

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:33.140 
buy them for less than ten percents it
doesn't<00:02:31.650> seem<00:02:31.799> worth<00:02:32.010> it<00:02:32.250> if<00:02:32.430> I'm<00:02:32.670> not<00:02:32.819> getting

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
doesn't seem worth it if I'm not getting

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.630 
doesn't seem worth it if I'm not getting
at<00:02:33.269> least<00:02:33.420> five<00:02:33.689> percent<00:02:34.189> return<00:02:35.189> on<00:02:35.489> my

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
at least five percent return on my

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.210 
at least five percent return on my
investment<00:02:35.670> so<00:02:36.540> so<00:02:37.379> that<00:02:37.560> means<00:02:37.769> I<00:02:37.920> would<00:02:38.069> have

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
investment so so that means I would have

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.220 
investment so so that means I would have
to<00:02:38.310> buy<00:02:38.489> him<00:02:38.700> a<00:02:38.730> ten<00:02:39.569> percent<00:02:39.689> less<00:02:40.079> than

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
to buy him a ten percent less than

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.599 
to buy him a ten percent less than
40,000<00:02:41.040> which<00:02:41.459> would<00:02:41.730> mean<00:02:43.459> 36,000<00:02:44.459> because

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:44.609 
40,000 which would mean 36,000 because

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:47.000 
40,000 which would mean 36,000 because
four<00:02:44.849> thousand<00:02:45.299> ten<00:02:45.510> percent<00:02:45.780> of<00:02:45.870> 40,000<00:02:46.530> so

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
four thousand ten percent of 40,000 so

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.190 
four thousand ten percent of 40,000 so
then<00:02:47.250> five<00:02:47.549> percent<00:02:47.970> of<00:02:48.060> that<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.510> two

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
then five percent of that the two

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.990 
then five percent of that the two
thousand<00:02:49.560> will<00:02:49.650> go<00:02:49.799> off<00:02:50.159> and<00:02:50.549> I'll<00:02:50.670> make<00:02:50.819> two

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
thousand will go off and I'll make two

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.780 
thousand will go off and I'll make two
thousand<00:02:51.420> profit<00:02:51.750> on<00:02:51.870> it<00:02:51.900> which<00:02:52.709> is<00:02:52.950> basically

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
thousand profit on it which is basically

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.460 
thousand profit on it which is basically
the<00:02:54.120> whole<00:02:54.269> principle<00:02:54.720> you<00:02:55.019> just<00:02:55.230> need<00:02:55.379> to

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
the whole principle you just need to

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.729 
the whole principle you just need to
make<00:02:55.620> sure<00:02:55.680> that<00:02:55.889> you're<00:02:56.780> not<00:02:57.780> buying<00:02:58.319> thing

buying and selling for like less than

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.099 
buying and selling for like less than
five<00:03:01.980> percent<00:03:02.519> because<00:03:03.060> you<00:03:03.480> just<00:03:03.689> lose<00:03:03.870> money

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:04.109 
five percent because you just lose money
