note natalie coughlin weakened the

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.740 
note natalie coughlin weakened the
breaststroke<00:03:24.920> but<00:03:25.700> didn't<00:03:26.000> seem<00:03:26.210> to<00:03:26.480> lose

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
breaststroke but didn't seem to lose

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.960 
breaststroke but didn't seem to lose
much<00:03:27.350> of<00:03:27.380> her<00:03:27.680> advantage<00:03:28.010> at<00:03:28.310> all<00:03:28.550> in<00:03:28.820> that

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
much of her advantage at all in that

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.600 
much of her advantage at all in that
third<00:03:29.240> leg<00:03:29.440> and<00:03:30.440> I<00:03:30.830> think<00:03:30.890> that<00:03:31.160> may<00:03:31.580> just

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
third leg and I think that may just

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.180 
third leg and I think that may just
plant<00:03:32.150> the<00:03:32.330> seed<00:03:32.570> for<00:03:32.600> you<00:03:33.080> see<00:03:33.290> the<00:03:33.440> first<00:03:33.710> 100

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
plant the seed for you see the first 100

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.160 
plant the seed for you see the first 100
you<00:03:34.280> know<00:03:34.460> how<00:03:34.640> strong<00:03:34.940> she<00:03:35.210> is<00:03:35.240> enough<00:03:35.540> in<00:03:35.720> the

you know how strong she is enough in the

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.720 
you know how strong she is enough in the
first<00:03:36.440> 100<00:03:36.920> she's<00:03:37.100> got<00:03:37.280> a<00:03:37.310> world-class

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
first 100 she's got a world-class

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.700 
first 100 she's got a world-class

credentials<00:03:40.130> in<00:03:40.460> the<00:03:40.550> backstroke<00:03:41.030> that's

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
credentials in the backstroke that's

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.780 
credentials in the backstroke that's
what<00:03:42.050> helped<00:03:42.350> her<00:03:42.470> build<00:03:42.680> this<00:03:42.890> big<00:03:43.160> lead<00:03:43.460> now

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
what helped her build this big lead now

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.090 
what helped her build this big lead now
she<00:03:44.270> didn't<00:03:44.630> give<00:03:44.840> up<00:03:45.050> much<00:03:45.350> of<00:03:45.380> it<00:03:45.770> on<00:03:45.920> the

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
she didn't give up much of it on the

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.290 
she didn't give up much of it on the
breaststroke<00:03:46.460> and<00:03:46.670> that's<00:03:46.880> where<00:03:47.060> I<00:03:47.090> thought

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:47.300 
breaststroke and that's where I thought

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.790 
breaststroke and that's where I thought
the<00:03:47.450> field<00:03:47.750> might<00:03:47.960> really<00:03:48.200> run<00:03:48.500> her<00:03:48.590> down

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
the field might really run her down

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.070 
the field might really run her down

obviously on to the Olympics is that

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.560 
obviously on to the Olympics is that
necessarily<00:04:36.680> the<00:04:36.920> case<00:04:37.150> yeah<00:04:38.150> I'm<00:04:38.330> still

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
necessarily the case yeah I'm still

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.960 
necessarily the case yeah I'm still
trying<00:04:38.840> to<00:04:38.870> figure<00:04:39.080> out<00:04:39.230> whether<00:04:39.790> I'm<00:04:40.790> gonna

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
trying to figure out whether I'm gonna

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.030 
trying to figure out whether I'm gonna
worry<00:04:41.270> about<00:04:41.330> the<00:04:41.600> tuner<00:04:41.810> diam<00:04:42.170> it's<00:04:42.440> a<00:04:42.680> great

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 
worry about the tuner diam it's a great

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.460 
worry about the tuner diam it's a great
event<00:04:43.190> for<00:04:43.430> me<00:04:43.640> and<00:04:44.360> I<00:04:44.480> believe<00:04:44.900> I<00:04:45.050> have<00:04:45.230> a<00:04:45.260> lot

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
event for me and I believe I have a lot

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.250 
event for me and I believe I have a lot
of<00:04:45.500> potential<00:04:45.890> but<00:04:46.040> it<00:04:46.490> also<00:04:47.110> overlaps<00:04:48.110> with

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
of potential but it also overlaps with

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.070 
of potential but it also overlaps with
100<00:04:48.650> backstroke<00:04:48.800> and<00:04:49.340> I<00:04:49.550> really<00:04:50.090> wanted<00:04:50.990> to

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
100 backstroke and I really wanted to

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.320 
100 backstroke and I really wanted to
focus<00:04:51.320> on<00:04:51.650> the<00:04:51.740> IM<00:04:52.010> today<00:04:52.280> because<00:04:52.640> my<00:04:52.880> next

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
focus on the IM today because my next

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.110 
focus on the IM today because my next
meet<00:04:54.110> isn't<00:04:54.530> until<00:04:54.800> about<00:04:54.980> March<00:04:55.280> and

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
I just want to evaluate whether I should

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.370 
I just want to evaluate whether I should
even<00:04:58.400> worry<00:04:59.330> about<00:04:59.419> this<00:04:59.690> unit<00:04:59.960> am<00:05:00.169> or<00:05:00.350> just
