00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
this piece of speeds back to ahead three

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.740 
this piece of speeds back to ahead three
and<00:00:32.309> four<00:00:32.989> so<00:00:34.820> right<00:00:35.820> now<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.090> situation<00:00:36.300> is

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
and four so right now the situation is

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.330 
and four so right now the situation is
that<00:00:36.809> we<00:00:37.170> are<00:00:37.200> having<00:00:37.530> 30<00:00:37.800> parts<00:00:38.160> of<00:00:38.250> the

hearts and we do a double lift then we

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.860 
hearts and we do a double lift then we
tell<00:00:50.250> expected<00:00:50.730> that<00:00:51.059> we<00:00:51.390> are<00:00:51.480> going<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.690> place

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
tell expected that we are going to place

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.020

having two cars underneath in two jokers

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:22.559 
having two cars underneath in two jokers
again<00:02:18.159> a<00:02:18.340> triple<00:02:19.239> lift<00:02:19.680> then<00:02:20.680> we<00:02:21.400> place<00:02:22.269> this

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
again a triple lift then we place this

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:25.289 
again a triple lift then we place this
card<00:02:22.870> which<00:02:23.650> is<00:02:23.950> a<00:02:23.980> joker<00:02:24.370> and<00:02:24.519> the<00:02:24.819> thing<00:02:25.060> is

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:25.299 
card which is a joker and the thing is

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:28.710 
card which is a joker and the thing is
he<00:02:25.780> soft<00:02:26.049> spades<00:02:26.409> and<00:02:26.590> tell<00:02:27.519> them<00:02:27.700> that<00:02:27.730> they

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
he soft spades and tell them that they

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.569 
he soft spades and tell them that they
stock<00:02:29.019> speed<00:02:29.290> still<00:02:29.560> jumps<00:02:29.890> back<00:02:30.099> to<00:02:30.250> the<00:02:30.370> top

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:30.579 
stock speed still jumps back to the top

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:34.050 
stock speed still jumps back to the top
and<00:02:30.940> now<00:02:31.390> this<00:02:31.629> is<00:02:31.690> a<00:02:31.720> double<00:02:31.900> lift<00:02:32.790> to<00:02:33.790> the<00:02:33.819> top

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
and now this is a double lift to the top

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.460 
and now this is a double lift to the top
so<00:02:34.720> double<00:02:34.989> lift<00:02:35.370> and<00:02:36.840> again<00:02:37.840> we<00:02:37.989> do<00:02:38.110> a<00:02:38.140> double

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
so double lift and again we do a double

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.130 
so double lift and again we do a double
lift<00:02:38.730> you<00:02:39.730> take<00:02:39.970> the<00:02:40.090> card<00:02:40.329> the<00:02:40.780> thing<00:02:40.989> is<00:02:41.019> a

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
lift you take the card the thing is a

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.080 
lift you take the card the thing is a
suspect<00:02:41.440> we<00:02:41.799> think<00:02:42.010> is<00:02:42.099> and<00:02:42.579> actually<00:02:42.730> is<00:02:43.060> a

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
suspect we think is and actually is a

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.940 
suspect we think is and actually is a
joker<00:02:44.069> so<00:02:45.069> we<00:02:46.060> again<00:02:46.359> say<00:02:46.569> that<00:02:46.780> this<00:02:47.440> ace<00:02:47.739> of

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
joker so we again say that this ace of

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:54.000 
joker so we again say that this ace of
spade<00:02:48.760> still<00:02:49.420> jumped<00:02:49.810> back<00:02:50.019> to<00:02:50.200> the<00:02:50.319> top<00:02:53.010> so

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
spade still jumped back to the top so

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.470 
spade still jumped back to the top so
now<00:02:54.819> for<00:02:55.120> the<00:02:55.390> fourth<00:02:55.690> card<00:02:55.959> we<00:02:56.170> show<00:02:56.349> them<00:02:56.590> we
