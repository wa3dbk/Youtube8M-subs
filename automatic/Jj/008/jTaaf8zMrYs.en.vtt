what's up guys it is matte or Frizzle

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.939 
what's up guys it is matte or Frizzle
and<00:00:13.769> HD<00:00:14.570> bringing<00:00:15.570> you<00:00:15.719> another<00:00:15.929> mod<00:00:16.440> review

and HD bringing you another mod review

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.880 
and HD bringing you another mod review
and<00:00:17.190> this<00:00:17.640> mod<00:00:17.850> is<00:00:18.119> no<00:00:18.390> physics<00:00:18.960> so<00:00:19.560> once<00:00:19.770> you

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
and this mod is no physics so once you

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.260 
and this mod is no physics so once you
get<00:00:20.039> them<00:00:20.220> all<00:00:20.369> completely<00:00:20.850> installing

creative on start land and now the
mission<00:00:30.869> begins<00:00:31.140> alright<00:00:31.980> so<00:00:32.250> what<00:00:32.669> you<00:00:32.700> have

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
mission begins alright so what you have

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.310 
mission begins alright so what you have
to<00:00:32.940> do<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.239> get<00:00:33.329> this<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.570> really<00:00:33.719> work<00:00:33.809> is<00:00:34.140> type

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
to do to get this to really work is type

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.940 
to do to get this to really work is type
slash<00:00:34.530> physics<00:00:35.960> alright<00:00:36.960> once<00:00:37.530> you<00:00:37.620> have<00:00:37.770> that

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
slash physics alright once you have that

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.250 
slash physics alright once you have that
you<00:00:38.280> can<00:00:38.460> do<00:00:38.579> whatever<00:00:38.820> you<00:00:39.420> want<00:00:39.660> there<00:00:40.170> are

you can do whatever you want there are
no<00:00:40.440> more<00:00:40.649> physics<00:00:41.070> in<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.340> game<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:41.820> I'll

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
no more physics in the game and I'll

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.580 
no more physics in the game and I'll
show<00:00:42.690> you<00:00:42.780> how<00:00:42.870> cool<00:00:43.110> that<00:00:43.140> is

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
show you how cool that is

block alright there we go so normally if
I<00:00:48.960> wanted<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.969> put<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.180> pressure<00:00:51.480> plate<00:00:51.750> on<00:00:52.140> TNT

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
I wanted to put a pressure plate on TNT

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.750 
I wanted to put a pressure plate on TNT
I<00:00:52.770> couldn't<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:54.180> like<00:00:54.899> normally<00:00:55.739> if<00:00:56.460> I<00:00:56.579> wrote

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
I couldn't and like normally if I wrote

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.910 
I couldn't and like normally if I wrote
this<00:00:56.910> stone<00:00:57.360> block<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:58.469> pressure<00:00:58.710> plate

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
this stone block the pressure plate

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.000 
this stone block the pressure plate
would<00:00:59.070> disappear<00:00:59.489> not<00:01:00.300> in<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.510> physics<00:01:01.010> it's

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
would disappear not in the physics it's

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.860 
would disappear not in the physics it's
freaking<00:01:02.280> awesome<00:01:02.399> so<00:01:02.820> now<00:01:02.969> whenever

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
freaking awesome so now whenever

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.050 
freaking awesome so now whenever
someone's<00:01:04.199> falls<00:01:04.379> on<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:05.060> you<00:01:06.060> know<00:01:06.180> it<00:01:06.450> breaks

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
someone's falls on it you know it breaks

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.450 
someone's falls on it you know it breaks
pretty<00:01:09.060> epic<00:01:09.270> right<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:10.560> so<00:01:10.710> this<00:01:10.860> can<00:01:10.979> let

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
pretty epic right and so this can let

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
you have some pretty amazing traps so if

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.469 
you have some pretty amazing traps so if
I<00:01:14.760> get<00:01:14.820> my<00:01:15.090> snow<00:01:15.420> out<00:01:16.220> check<00:01:17.220> this<00:01:17.369> out<00:01:17.640> I<00:01:17.909> can

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
I get my snow out check this out I can

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.859 
I get my snow out check this out I can
dig<00:01:18.780> down<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:19.259> little<00:01:19.409> 4x4<00:01:20.159> square<00:01:20.490> so<00:01:21.360> picture

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
dig down a little 4x4 square so picture

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.570 
dig down a little 4x4 square so picture
this<00:01:22.049> I'm<00:01:22.350> in<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:23.960> biome<00:01:24.960> where<00:01:25.530> you<00:01:26.130> know<00:01:26.310> like

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
this I'm in a biome where you know like

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.620 
this I'm in a biome where you know like
a<00:01:27.330> snow<00:01:27.509> biome<00:01:27.720> not<00:01:28.439> anything<00:01:28.650> near<00:01:28.979> here<00:01:29.280> but

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
a snow biome not anything near here but

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.050 
a snow biome not anything near here but
whatever<00:01:31.070> picture<00:01:32.070> I'm<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.280> snow<00:01:32.520> biome<00:01:32.729> and

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
whatever picture I'm a snow biome and

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.270 
whatever picture I'm a snow biome and
once<00:01:33.360> that<00:01:33.509> trap<00:01:34.049> for<00:01:34.500> this<00:01:34.650> custom<00:01:35.009> map<00:01:35.130> I'm

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
once that trap for this custom map I'm

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.020 
once that trap for this custom map I'm
making<00:01:35.610> all<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.750> sudden<00:01:37.079> I<00:01:37.490> think<00:01:38.490> this<00:01:38.880> will

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
making all of a sudden I think this will

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.810 
making all of a sudden I think this will
work<00:01:39.299> I'm<00:01:39.930> not

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.780 

dang<00:01:43.600> it<00:01:43.720> I<00:01:43.780> did<00:01:43.960> wrong<00:01:44.280> only<00:01:45.280> flaw<00:01:45.460> I<00:01:45.490> have

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
dang it I did wrong only flaw I have

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.660 
dang it I did wrong only flaw I have
with<00:01:46.180> this<00:01:46.330> unfortunately<00:01:47.260> I'm<00:01:47.620> not<00:01:47.670> very

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
with this unfortunately I'm not very

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.950 
with this unfortunately I'm not very
good<00:01:49.060> at<00:01:49.780> laying<00:01:50.500> everything<00:01:50.710> out<00:01:50.890> first<00:01:51.250> so

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
good at laying everything out first so

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.740 
good at laying everything out first so
first<00:01:52.960> I<00:01:53.110> would<00:01:53.260> have<00:01:53.290> to<00:01:53.560> put<00:01:54.190> this<00:01:54.510> break<00:01:55.510> all

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
first I would have to put this break all

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.170 
first I would have to put this break all
of<00:01:55.780> this<00:01:56.850> put<00:01:57.850> the<00:01:58.000> stone<00:01:58.600> up<00:01:58.869> up<00:01:59.770> to<00:01:59.950> here<00:02:00.310> put

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
of this put the stone up up to here put

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.410 
of this put the stone up up to here put
all<00:02:01.390> the<00:02:01.900> snow<00:02:02.290> down<00:02:03.720> now<00:02:04.720> put<00:02:05.229> the<00:02:05.470> all<00:02:05.619> of<00:02:05.860> the

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
all the snow down now put the all of the

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.210 
all the snow down now put the all of the
TNT<00:02:07.420> and<00:02:09.209> put<00:02:10.209> the<00:02:10.300> under<00:02:10.570> layer<00:02:10.750> TNT<00:02:11.260> then<00:02:12.040> put

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
TNT and put the under layer TNT then put

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.910 
TNT and put the under layer TNT then put
the<00:02:12.280> pressure<00:02:12.520> plate<00:02:13.440> break<00:02:14.440> all<00:02:14.590> of<00:02:14.740> these

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
the pressure plate break all of these

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.550 
the pressure plate break all of these
blocks<00:02:17.430> easy<00:02:18.430> right<00:02:18.959> like<00:02:19.959> if<00:02:20.170> you<00:02:20.320> don't<00:02:20.470> have

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
blocks easy right like if you don't have

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.890 
blocks easy right like if you don't have
any<00:02:20.739> experience<00:02:21.040> with<00:02:21.370> mcedit<00:02:22.060> but<00:02:22.630> you<00:02:22.720> want

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
any experience with mcedit but you want

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.620 
any experience with mcedit but you want
to<00:02:22.959> make<00:02:23.050> a<00:02:23.080> custom<00:02:23.440> map<00:02:23.640> this<00:02:24.640> is<00:02:24.760> perfect<00:02:25.239> cuz

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
to make a custom map this is perfect cuz

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.500 
to make a custom map this is perfect cuz
check<00:02:25.660> it<00:02:25.930> out<00:02:26.489> you<00:02:27.489> you<00:02:27.910> don't<00:02:28.060> see<00:02:28.180> yours

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
check it out you you don't see yours

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.900 
check it out you you don't see yours
like<00:02:28.660> what<00:02:28.989> it's<00:02:29.320> a<00:02:29.410> spot<00:02:29.739> and<00:02:30.430> when<00:02:30.550> you<00:02:30.670> go

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
like what it's a spot and when you go

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.630 
like what it's a spot and when you go
over<00:02:31.209> it<00:02:31.360> fall<00:02:31.780> through<00:02:31.830> lights<00:02:32.830> the<00:02:32.980> TNT<00:02:33.430> you

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
over it fall through lights the TNT you

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.150 
over it fall through lights the TNT you
get<00:02:33.790> stuck<00:02:34.060> inside<00:02:34.209> you<00:02:35.080> try<00:02:35.290> to<00:02:35.350> get<00:02:35.500> out<00:02:35.650> or

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
get stuck inside you try to get out or

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.110 
get stuck inside you try to get out or
so<00:02:36.400> that's<00:02:36.580> died<00:02:37.590> pretty<00:02:38.590> nice<00:02:38.890> huh<00:02:39.220> they<00:02:40.000> all

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
so that's died pretty nice huh they all

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.270 
so that's died pretty nice huh they all
another<00:02:40.480> cool<00:02:40.720> part<00:02:40.959> is<00:02:41.080> like<00:02:41.380> with<00:02:41.860> the<00:02:41.980> rails

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
another cool part is like with the rails

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.729 
another cool part is like with the rails
the<00:02:42.610> rail<00:02:42.790> systems<00:02:43.239> you<00:02:43.870> can<00:02:43.959> make<00:02:44.170> a<00:02:44.200> pretty

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
the rail systems you can make a pretty

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.280 
the rail systems you can make a pretty
insane<00:02:45.420> since<00:02:46.420> there's<00:02:46.570> no<00:02:46.690> more<00:02:46.840> physics

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
insane since there's no more physics

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.930 
insane since there's no more physics
that<00:02:47.470> means<00:02:47.680> that<00:02:47.860> rails<00:02:48.130> only<00:02:48.430> blocks<00:02:48.670> under

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
that means that rails only blocks under

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.570 
that means that rails only blocks under
them<00:02:49.120> so<00:02:49.930> if<00:02:50.080> you<00:02:50.170> make<00:02:50.320> a<00:02:50.350> cool<00:02:50.920> staircase<00:02:51.400> up

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
them so if you make a cool staircase up

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:52.979 
them so if you make a cool staircase up
first<00:02:51.790> because<00:02:52.060> there<00:02:52.299> has<00:02:52.420> to<00:02:52.450> be<00:02:52.600> a<00:02:52.690> block

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
first because there has to be a block

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.729 
first because there has to be a block
underneath<00:02:54.269> the<00:02:55.269> thing<00:02:56.080> then<00:02:56.410> you<00:02:56.530> can<00:02:56.650> break

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
underneath the thing then you can break

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.009 
underneath the thing then you can break
the<00:02:56.860> block<00:02:57.070> and<00:02:57.220> everything<00:02:57.489> works<00:02:57.640> fine<00:02:58.019> it's

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
the block and everything works fine it's

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:01.789 
the block and everything works fine it's
just<00:02:59.079> check<00:02:59.769> this<00:02:59.920> out<00:03:00.130> it's<00:03:00.489> just<00:03:00.610> so<00:03:01.000> cool

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
just check this out it's just so cool

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.770 
just check this out it's just so cool
like<00:03:02.799> I've<00:03:02.980> never<00:03:03.459> seen<00:03:03.640> this<00:03:04.000> done<00:03:04.239> by<00:03:04.570> and

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
like I've never seen this done by and

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.170 
like I've never seen this done by and
the<00:03:04.870> other<00:03:04.989> mod<00:03:05.260> ever<00:03:05.890> it's<00:03:06.760> really<00:03:07.000> helpful

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
the other mod ever it's really helpful

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.810 
the other mod ever it's really helpful
for<00:03:07.299> map<00:03:07.630> making<00:03:08.049> like<00:03:08.320> it's<00:03:09.160> ridiculous<00:03:09.579> how

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
for map making like it's ridiculous how

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.250 
for map making like it's ridiculous how
much<00:03:09.910> it<00:03:10.090> can<00:03:10.329> help<00:03:10.510> because<00:03:10.900> now<00:03:11.019> you<00:03:11.079> can

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
much it can help because now you can

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.930 
much it can help because now you can
just<00:03:11.410> touch<00:03:11.590> everything<00:03:11.980> by<00:03:12.100> hand<00:03:12.340> and<00:03:12.850> you

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
just touch everything by hand and you

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.750 
just touch everything by hand and you
don't<00:03:13.090> have<00:03:13.150> to<00:03:13.299> go<00:03:13.450> into<00:03:13.780> a<00:03:13.959> separate<00:03:14.320> program

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
don't have to go into a separate program

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.699 
don't have to go into a separate program
and<00:03:15.760> get<00:03:15.940> everything<00:03:16.120> working<00:03:16.420> so<00:03:16.780> works<00:03:17.500> fine

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
and get everything working so works fine

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:22.229 
and get everything working so works fine
perfectly<00:03:18.160> go<00:03:19.060> forward<00:03:19.510> go<00:03:20.200> down<00:03:20.820> pretty<00:03:21.820> cool

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
perfectly go forward go down pretty cool

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:25.319 
perfectly go forward go down pretty cool
and<00:03:22.510> just<00:03:22.989> if<00:03:23.110> I<00:03:23.230> break<00:03:23.500> one<00:03:24.030> the<00:03:25.030> rest<00:03:25.180> will

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
and just if I break one the rest will

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:27.449 
and just if I break one the rest will
stay<00:03:25.420> there<00:03:25.690> so<00:03:25.989> even<00:03:26.590> if<00:03:26.769> you<00:03:26.829> mess<00:03:27.010> up<00:03:27.040> it's

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
stay there so even if you mess up it's

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.090 
stay there so even if you mess up it's
easy<00:03:27.670> to<00:03:27.850> fix<00:03:28.120> these<00:03:28.390> so<00:03:29.170> that's<00:03:29.320> really<00:03:29.769> cool

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
easy to fix these so that's really cool

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.360 
easy to fix these so that's really cool
now<00:03:30.700> another<00:03:31.030> cool<00:03:31.269> part<00:03:31.480> is<00:03:31.600> the<00:03:31.870> sand<00:03:32.290> so<00:03:33.100> we

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
now another cool part is the sand so we

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.900 
now another cool part is the sand so we
all<00:03:33.489> know<00:03:33.640> sand<00:03:34.060> traps<00:03:34.390> like<00:03:34.890> you<00:03:35.890> uh<00:03:35.920> cobweb

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
all know sand traps like you uh cobweb

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.259 
all know sand traps like you uh cobweb
letting<00:03:37.150> those<00:03:37.269> two<00:03:38.070> sand<00:03:39.070> traps<00:03:39.370> and<00:03:39.549> cobwebs

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
letting those two sand traps and cobwebs

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:42.210 
letting those two sand traps and cobwebs
well<00:03:40.660> now<00:03:40.780> you<00:03:40.840> can<00:03:41.019> actually<00:03:41.200> do<00:03:41.560> it<00:03:41.709> in<00:03:41.829> legit

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
well now you can actually do it in legit

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.680 
well now you can actually do it in legit
Minecraft<00:03:42.670> without<00:03:42.940> having<00:03:43.239> to<00:03:43.329> open<00:03:43.480> a

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
Minecraft without having to open a

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:44.720 
Minecraft without having to open a
program

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
program

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.300 
program
so<00:03:45.730> pretty<00:03:46.480> much<00:03:46.570> I<00:03:46.870> can<00:03:47.019> just<00:03:47.049> stack<00:03:47.440> the

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
so pretty much I can just stack the

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:55.920 
so pretty much I can just stack the
stand<00:03:48.910> up<00:03:50.010> like<00:03:51.010> that<00:03:51.070> and<00:03:53.010> now<00:03:54.600> if<00:03:55.600> someone

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
stand up like that and now if someone

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.760 
stand up like that and now if someone
comes<00:03:56.200> along<00:03:56.350> and<00:03:56.850> physics<00:03:57.850> are<00:03:58.470> back<00:03:59.470> off

00:03:59.760 --> 00:03:59.770 
comes along and physics are back off

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:03.300 
comes along and physics are back off
slash<00:04:00.190> physics<00:04:01.080> now<00:04:02.080> it<00:04:02.200> goes<00:04:02.290> back<00:04:02.350> and<00:04:02.920> if

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
slash physics now it goes back and if

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.699 
slash physics now it goes back and if
they<00:04:03.520> got<00:04:03.700> on<00:04:03.790> top<00:04:03.970> of<00:04:04.000> it<00:04:04.270> and<00:04:04.530> they<00:04:05.530> break<00:04:05.650> a

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
they got on top of it and they break a

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:09.199 
they got on top of it and they break a
block<00:04:05.980> the<00:04:06.640> other<00:04:06.820> one<00:04:06.940> should<00:04:07.180> sink<00:04:08.160> okay

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
block the other one should sink okay

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.840 
block the other one should sink okay
they're<00:04:10.920> not<00:04:11.920> really<00:04:12.160> sure<00:04:12.490> what's<00:04:12.730> not

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
they're not really sure what's not

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.360 
they're not really sure what's not
working<00:04:13.240> how<00:04:14.200> it<00:04:14.320> is<00:04:14.410> working<00:04:14.560> it's<00:04:15.220> just

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
working how it is working it's just

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.599 
working how it is working it's just
really<00:04:15.550> slow<00:04:16.079> yep<00:04:17.280> actually<00:04:18.280> don't<00:04:18.430> have<00:04:18.489> it

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
really slow yep actually don't have it

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:21.659 
really slow yep actually don't have it
be<00:04:18.670> a<00:04:18.730> block<00:04:19.000> update<00:04:19.799> so<00:04:20.799> let<00:04:21.070> me<00:04:21.190> fix<00:04:21.430> this

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
be a block update so let me fix this

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:25.980 
be a block update so let me fix this
because<00:04:22.150> I'm<00:04:22.300> still<00:04:23.080> new<00:04:23.320> about<00:04:23.530> this<00:04:24.990> alright

because I'm still new about this alright
so<00:04:26.410> if<00:04:26.470> there<00:04:26.860> was<00:04:27.070> a<00:04:28.080> sim<00:04:29.080> block<00:04:29.440> there<00:04:30.340> and

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
so if there was a sim block there and

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:39.659 
so if there was a sim block there and
there<00:04:33.000> and<00:04:34.860> let's<00:04:35.860> just<00:04:35.919> say<00:04:36.300> they're<00:04:38.669> all

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:39.669 
there and let's just say they're all

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:44.940 
there and let's just say they're all
right<00:04:39.790> so<00:04:40.169> slash<00:04:41.169> physics<00:04:43.110> so<00:04:44.110> if<00:04:44.230> I<00:04:44.320> want<00:04:44.590> peer

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.950 
right so slash physics so if I want peer

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:47.190 
right so slash physics so if I want peer
and<00:04:45.190> someone<00:04:45.610> breaks<00:04:45.700> a<00:04:45.820> block<00:04:46.030> this<00:04:47.020> one

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.200 
and someone breaks a block this one

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.140 
and someone breaks a block this one
sinks<00:04:47.590> and<00:04:47.740> I<00:04:47.919> sink<00:04:48.250> in<00:04:48.340> the<00:04:48.400> six<00:04:48.669> and

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
sinks and I sink in the six and

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.500 
sinks and I sink in the six and
stand<00:04:49.720> for<00:04:50.260> my<00:04:50.380> same<00:04:50.680> I<00:04:50.950> fall<00:04:51.610> into<00:04:51.790> sink<00:04:52.210> stand

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
stand for my same I fall into sink stand

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.400 
stand for my same I fall into sink stand
sink<00:04:53.169> I<00:04:53.440> can't<00:04:53.740> say<00:04:54.280> words<00:04:55.020> quicksand<00:04:56.020> there

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410 
sink I can't say words quicksand there

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.130 
sink I can't say words quicksand there
we<00:04:56.560> go<00:04:56.740> and<00:04:56.950> I<00:04:57.310> fall<00:04:57.460> into<00:04:57.580> lava<00:04:57.760> and<00:04:58.120> die<00:04:58.300> so

00:04:59.130 --> 00:04:59.140 
we go and I fall into lava and die so

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:00.180 
we go and I fall into lava and die so
it's<00:04:59.229> pretty<00:04:59.320> cool<00:04:59.530> you<00:04:59.680> can<00:04:59.800> just<00:04:59.919> make<00:05:00.070> that

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
it's pretty cool you can just make that

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:01.860 
it's pretty cool you can just make that
out<00:05:00.460> of<00:05:00.520> normal<00:05:00.820> stuff<00:05:01.090> another<00:05:01.390> cool<00:05:01.840> thing

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
out of normal stuff another cool thing

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.469 
out of normal stuff another cool thing
is<00:05:02.410> the<00:05:03.010> lava<00:05:03.310> you<00:05:03.790> make<00:05:03.970> so<00:05:04.150> many<00:05:04.300> cool<00:05:04.419> things

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479 
is the lava you make so many cool things

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:07.080 
is the lava you make so many cool things
out<00:05:04.810> of<00:05:04.840> this<00:05:04.960> so<00:05:05.200> check<00:05:05.410> this<00:05:05.500> out<00:05:05.770> no<00:05:06.669> physics

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
out of this so check this out no physics

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:13.250 
out of this so check this out no physics
with<00:05:07.180> lava<00:05:07.450> oh<00:05:08.880> I<00:05:09.880> mean<00:05:10.690> I<00:05:10.810> did<00:05:10.960> it<00:05:11.080> wrong<00:05:11.229> but<00:05:11.470> I

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
with lava oh I mean I did it wrong but I

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.370 
with lava oh I mean I did it wrong but I
saw<00:05:14.260> it<00:05:14.440> on<00:05:14.590> the<00:05:14.770> guys<00:05:14.950> page<00:05:15.430> that<00:05:15.790> you<00:05:15.970> can

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 
saw it on the guys page that you can

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.450 
saw it on the guys page that you can
like<00:05:17.380> make<00:05:17.650> letters<00:05:17.979> and<00:05:18.280> stuff<00:05:18.669> with<00:05:18.940> TNT<00:05:19.419> I

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
like make letters and stuff with TNT I

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:30.960 
like make letters and stuff with TNT I
think<00:05:21.460> it's<00:05:21.580> something<00:05:21.790> like<00:05:23.880> this<00:05:28.200> no<00:05:29.669> no<00:05:30.669> oh

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:30.970 
think it's something like this no no oh

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.250 
think it's something like this no no oh
wait<00:05:31.510> no<00:05:31.690> I<00:05:31.720> rather<00:05:32.140> do<00:05:32.410> such<00:05:32.590> physics<00:05:32.950> again<00:05:33.160> I

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:34.260 
wait no I rather do such physics again I

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.680 
wait no I rather do such physics again I
think

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690 
think

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.690 
think
hmm<00:05:37.920> yeah<00:05:38.920> yeah<00:05:39.100> and<00:05:39.250> I'll<00:05:39.340> just<00:05:39.520> go<00:05:39.640> straight

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:39.700 
hmm yeah yeah and I'll just go straight

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:43.290 
hmm yeah yeah and I'll just go straight
down<00:05:40.140> so<00:05:41.140> if<00:05:41.230> I<00:05:41.290> block<00:05:41.530> this<00:05:41.710> up<00:05:41.890> I<00:05:42.270> can<00:05:43.270> make

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.300 
down so if I block this up I can make

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.460 
down so if I block this up I can make
really<00:05:43.810> cool<00:05:43.990> things<00:05:44.230> I<00:05:44.790> can<00:05:45.790> make<00:05:45.820> like

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.470 
really cool things I can make like

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:50.340 
really cool things I can make like
something<00:05:47.470> that<00:05:47.560> says<00:05:48.840> it's<00:05:49.840> gonna<00:05:49.990> be<00:05:50.140> bad

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:50.350 
something that says it's gonna be bad

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:55.800 
something that says it's gonna be bad
ooh<00:05:53.640> told<00:05:54.640> you<00:05:54.820> I'm<00:05:55.000> not<00:05:55.240> very<00:05:55.300> good<00:05:55.690> at<00:05:55.750> this

yep<00:06:12.160> you<00:06:12.400> can<00:06:12.490> just<00:06:12.610> make<00:06:12.700> a<00:06:12.790> float<00:06:14.190> which

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:15.190 
yep you can just make a float which

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:16.350 
yep you can just make a float which
looks<00:06:15.400> pretty<00:06:15.580> cool<00:06:15.760> and<00:06:16.000> then<00:06:16.090> you<00:06:16.120> can<00:06:16.270> make

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:16.360 
looks pretty cool and then you can make

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:17.850 
looks pretty cool and then you can make
cool<00:06:16.480> designs<00:06:16.750> with<00:06:16.870> that<00:06:17.020> obviously<00:06:17.680> I'm<00:06:17.800> not

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:17.860 
cool designs with that obviously I'm not

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.040 
cool designs with that obviously I'm not
very<00:06:18.040> good<00:06:18.130> if<00:06:18.700> you<00:06:18.970> want<00:06:19.180> to<00:06:19.240> try<00:06:19.330> not<00:06:19.600> like

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:26.440 
like I just float in there you know just

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:30.170 
like I just float in there you know just
just<00:06:27.160> float<00:06:27.400> in<00:06:27.490> there<00:06:27.640> looks<00:06:28.300> pretty<00:06:28.510> cool

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:30.180 
just float in there looks pretty cool

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.760 
just float in there looks pretty cool
so<00:06:31.180> this<00:06:31.330> mala<00:06:31.540> is<00:06:31.660> freaking<00:06:32.050> awesome<00:06:32.230> if<00:06:32.620> you
