his chances of hitting the ball or a
whole<00:01:20.490> lot<00:01:20.670> more<00:01:21.330> better<00:01:22.850> because<00:01:23.850> you've

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
whole lot more better because you've

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.240 
whole lot more better because you've
shown<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:25.080> rhythm<00:01:25.530> that<00:01:25.680> you're<00:01:25.860> going<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.070> do

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
shown a rhythm that you're going to do

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.690 
shown a rhythm that you're going to do
every<00:01:26.549> time<00:01:26.790> he<00:01:27.090> gets<00:01:27.240> his<00:01:27.509> timing<00:01:27.960> down<00:01:28.340> so<00:01:29.340> a

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
every time he gets his timing down so a

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.880 
every time he gets his timing down so a
pitcher<00:01:30.240> wants<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.540> catch<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:31.020> hitter<00:01:31.229> and

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
pitcher wants to catch the hitter and

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.940 
pitcher wants to catch the hitter and
throw<00:01:32.790> his<00:01:32.939> timing<00:01:33.329> off<00:01:33.450> anyway<00:01:33.869> Kim<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.530> the

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
throw his timing off anyway Kim and the

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.999 
throw his timing off anyway Kim and the
knuckleball<00:01:35.460> is<00:01:35.640> one<00:01:35.820> way<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.060> do<00:01:36.270> that

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
knuckleball is one way to do that

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:39.620 
knuckleball is one way to do that
because<00:01:38.009> he<00:01:38.220> doesn't<00:01:38.400> see<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.759> same<00:01:39.000> spin<00:01:39.420> or

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
because he doesn't see the same spin or

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.539 
because he doesn't see the same spin or
the<00:01:39.750> same<00:01:39.990> arch<00:01:40.290> every<00:01:40.650> time<00:01:40.890> normally<00:01:41.400> the

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
the same arch every time normally the

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.080 
the same arch every time normally the
knuckleball<00:01:42.119> when<00:01:43.049> I<00:01:43.200> throw<00:01:43.470> it<00:01:43.619> will<00:01:43.770> be<00:01:44.090> at

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
knuckleball when I throw it will be at

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.630 
knuckleball when I throw it will be at
the<00:01:45.299> minimum<00:01:45.659> amount<00:01:46.140> of<00:01:46.229> arch<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:47.280> where<00:01:47.460> you

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
the minimum amount of arch to where you

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.160 
the minimum amount of arch to where you
keep<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:47.880> ball<00:01:48.180> down<00:01:48.210> on<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.840> hitters

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
keep the ball down on the hitters

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.710 
keep the ball down on the hitters
especially<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.280> bigger<00:01:50.520> hitters<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:51.509> keep

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
especially the bigger hitters to keep

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.139 
especially the bigger hitters to keep
them<00:01:51.869> from<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.619> forces<00:01:53.040> of<00:01:53.159> all<00:01:53.369> up<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.880> get<00:01:54.030> it

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
them from the forces of all up to get it

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.990 
them from the forces of all up to get it
out<00:01:54.270> farther<00:01:54.829> the<00:01:55.829> knee<00:01:56.100> high<00:01:56.310> pitch<00:01:56.640> on<00:01:56.850> the

hitter<00:01:59.340> is<00:01:59.579> one<00:01:59.759> of<00:01:59.850> the<00:01:59.909> toughest<00:02:00.240> pitches<00:02:00.479> to

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
hitter is one of the toughest pitches to

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.020 
hitter is one of the toughest pitches to
hit<00:02:00.960> and<00:02:01.229> that's<00:02:01.670> that's<00:02:02.670> where<00:02:02.939> that

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
hit and that's that's where that

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.789 
hit and that's that's where that
knuckleball<00:02:03.450> can<00:02:03.750> come<00:02:03.960> in<00:02:04.140> because<00:02:04.320> you<00:02:04.619> can
