00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 people want and want to support not so much 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.870
 is if you want to support that now and everything 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.030
 a movement in favor of this issue of 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:14.460
 that the rival does not sleep 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:27.320
 what if I was doing it when I 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:27.320
 they went on to disseminate the project 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:36.480
 end up winning what can happen 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.860
 imagine when it only remains 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.629
 demonstrate football superiority 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.629
 of the rival but also 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:54.300
 imagine on the top floor 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:58.500
 that you are going to carry out there 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:01.379
 that put it that people go people 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.550
 is not going to be a thing I needed to get 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.550
 to the 10th floor 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:12.090
 before regarding the selection that the 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.100
 Chinese be tired but put on 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:19.170
 earplugs is simply 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.520
 so that people come by right there 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.619
 Now that is really a benefit 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:29.420
 later during the game there 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:29.420
 let's be thinking because I can not go to 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.850
 any selection competition type of 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:38.149
 eliminatory the opponent always several 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.149
 countries 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.330
 currently we are the only ones 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.039
 good people that we promote in the 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.360
 networks everyone knows it and the 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:47.850
 answer is the same video that is 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.319
 hung on youtube of the Chileans I 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.030
 it seems that it is much smarter 

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:54.350
 that the proposal my hands on that 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.350
 but they are supporting us 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:04.160
 in Youtube 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.160
 they have a lot of nonsense 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:16.550
 and finally this project sees the light and 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.550
 the people get together and they go 20 25 people 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.890
 also more roche we're still going
