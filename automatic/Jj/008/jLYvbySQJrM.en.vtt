00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.820
 According to the sources of the art of Israel 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.250
 used the Turkish military bases for 

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:10.049
 attacks against syria on July 5th strike 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.209
 Syrian port Latakia 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:13.519
 aim of attack held in the predawn 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:14.969
 the watches were supposedly 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:17.400
 yacht antiship missiles 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.600
 Russian-made American 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.330
 officials on condition of anonymity 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.920
 reported that a blow to the armory 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.020
 inflicted Israeli fighters 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.510
 not so far is the Russian 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.640
 base suspicion that the attack committed 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.800
 it is Israel voiced everywhere 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.449
 it is known that there are dead and wounded from 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.370
 numbers of Syrian soldiers 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:37.320
 officially responsible for the attack 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.179
 no one took the Israeli authorities 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.100
 refused to comment on the situation 

00:00:39.179 --> 00:00:43.050
 about exactly how the events unfolded 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.819
 there is no clear idea now 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.859
 it is reported that the blow could have been delivered 

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:49.230
 long-range missiles with 

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:51.149
 submarine mediterranean is important what 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.039
 this attack according to sources 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.499
 art was carried out from the Turkish side 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.179
 borders on this information are Israeli 

00:00:55.499 --> 00:00:59.370
 the planes took off from the military base on 

00:00:57.179 --> 00:01:01.199
 the territory of Turkey and approached the attack 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.269
 from the sea to stay outside 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.309
 Syrian airspace in 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:07.500
 Otherwise, the Syrian air force would have 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.390
 legal grounds knock them down if these 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.920
 the data is correct then we are talking about the next 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.840
 shamelessly i'm still israel 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.390
 territory of another state without 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.490
 any declaration of war i 4 with 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.680
 the beginning of the year of the attack of Israel against Syria 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.570
 relations between Israel and Turkey in 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.180
 recent years have been far from warm and 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.860
 friendly 2010 happened 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.229
 incident grabbed and freedom when 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.420
 nine people killed incident condemned 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.159
 worldwide and although information about what 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.030
 exactly what happened did 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.130
 contradictory 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.409
 Israel did not apologize to 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.600
 March of this year when apologize 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.460
 followed turkey them took it 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.829
 actively covered the international media 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.359
 no one expected such a development between 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.820
 two countries there was a large 

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:49.979
 tension turkey recalled ambassador from 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.109
 Israel and suspended diplomatic 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.060
 relationship and suddenly a strange change in 

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:56.219
 relationship with tel aviv and now 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.780
 Turkey and Israel regional forces 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.789
 being at odds with each other 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.079
 incoming messages are collaborating with 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:03.390
 the purpose of striking the territory 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:06.060
 Syria at one time these countries 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.009
 maintained very close contact and at 90 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.110
 led active cooperation especially 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.820
 military sphere 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.130
 after the incident grabbed and freedom 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.960
 the situation has deteriorated sharply and now you can 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.090
 expect fair questions about 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.800
 how sincere were the apologies 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.140
 israel and how and why 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.700
 Muslim country Turkey has provided 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.560
 to their sworn enemy israel 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.570
 the ability to use Turkish 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.880
 bases for hitting another Muslim 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:31.250
 country and such cooperation with Israel 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.590
 undoubtedly threatens Turkey serious 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.040
 consequences and because popping up 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.040
 called
