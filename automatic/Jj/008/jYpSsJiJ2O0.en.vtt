00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:11.150
 fluorine carbon main leader such a relationship 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.430
 year very popular and deservedly them 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.320
 we of very important properties 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.360
 use we perform can also provide focus 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.490
 convinced that must still be this moment 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.080
 be able to bid better 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.300
 trans khaki the colors that are already in one 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.789
 number of accessories in the edge range 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.199
 used is now also applied or fire 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:28.610
 carbon 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:30.440
 have underwater diving for reviews 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.210
 demonstrated that the trans kaki 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:35.629
 if less visible than the 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:38.569
 traditional full carbon especially where the 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:39.949
 line through the water comes blake 

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:42.319
 this line much less visible 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:45.100
 so better camouflage from you 

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:45.100
 education system 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:53.059
 lesion is there in 16 lb 35 hundredths and 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:55.339
 in 1911 at 39 hundredths 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.769
 200 meters further, it is 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:01:00.440
 similar to what you were used to from 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:01.370
 floor gabon it's a pretty smooth one 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.690
 variant 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.719
 so it follows good contours of the 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.219
 bottom is great to shed but still has 

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:10.869
 are such a high specific gravity 

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:10.869
 which makes it good against the bottom of 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.520
 another addition 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:18.320
 also in a color trance quartier rouge 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.359
 hooklink winch material 20lb 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:24.700
 you can do both from very stiff underline 

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:27.350
 the user or dot boots in front 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.939
 you come close but also as people 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.380
 materials when you prefer braided 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:32.420
 or a netherlands mainline only uses 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.110
 anyway for the last five or ten or 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.110
 longer 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.590
 meters and curses bombs and love 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.720
 to apply 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.460
 who has high specific weight and 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.720
 sinks well to the bottom 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.490
 ilusion in 20lb and in something two something 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.250
 thinner variants 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.970
 specifically for underline the end mill 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.610
 come here is in bull is whatever you want

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.130
 underline material around those parts 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.130
