00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
but I'll but I'll talk about a little

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.810 
but I'll but I'll talk about a little
bit<00:00:38.370> about<00:00:39.410> just<00:00:40.410> a<00:00:40.530> couple<00:00:40.770> of<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.460> pictures

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
bit about just a couple of the pictures

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.790 
bit about just a couple of the pictures
that<00:00:41.940> I<00:00:42.030> did<00:00:42.059> for<00:00:42.480> it<00:00:42.510> one<00:00:43.290> of<00:00:43.379> them<00:00:43.500> being<00:00:43.649> the

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
that I did for it one of them being the

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.920 
that I did for it one of them being the
anglerfish<00:00:44.309> which<00:00:45.120> is<00:00:45.270> probably<00:00:45.480> one<00:00:45.780> of<00:00:45.809> the

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
anglerfish which is probably one of the

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.450 
anglerfish which is probably one of the
more<00:00:46.379> simple<00:00:47.010> things<00:00:47.370> about<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:49.460> the

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
more simple things about it and the

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.799 
more simple things about it and the
thing<00:00:50.489> about<00:00:50.700> doing<00:00:51.410> the<00:00:52.410> songs<00:00:52.680> for<00:00:53.010> Hank<00:00:53.190> is

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
thing about doing the songs for Hank is

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:57.830 
thing about doing the songs for Hank is
that<00:00:55.879> you<00:00:56.879> basically<00:00:57.059> just<00:00:57.390> wanted<00:00:57.750> me<00:00:57.809> to

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
that you basically just wanted me to

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.840 
that you basically just wanted me to
draw<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.140> songs<00:00:58.469> so<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.219> lyrics<00:00:59.579> are<00:00:59.640> already

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
draw the songs so the lyrics are already

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.779 
draw the songs so the lyrics are already
there<00:01:00.000> so<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.359> idea<00:01:00.480> for<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.309> drawing<00:01:02.609> is

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
there so the idea for the the drawing is

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.880 
there so the idea for the the drawing is
already<00:01:03.059> there<00:01:03.239> which<00:01:03.989> makes<00:01:04.260> it<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.650> lot

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
already there which makes it a lot

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.250 
already there which makes it a lot
easier<00:01:04.949> as<00:01:05.549> far<00:01:05.790> as<00:01:05.880> I'm<00:01:06.030> concerned<00:01:06.080> but<00:01:07.080> so

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
easier as far as I'm concerned but so

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.380 
easier as far as I'm concerned but so
jokes<00:01:07.530> for<00:01:07.710> example<00:01:08.130> he<00:01:08.280> wanted<00:01:08.610> me<00:01:08.790> he<00:01:09.210> just

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
jokes for example he wanted me he just

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.240 
jokes for example he wanted me he just
he<00:01:09.630> gave<00:01:09.810> me<00:01:09.930> free<00:01:10.200> rein<00:01:10.409> basically<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.070> do

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
he gave me free rein basically to do

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.609 
he gave me free rein basically to do
whatever<00:01:11.670> I<00:01:11.760> wanted<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.330> I<00:01:13.110> was<00:01:13.229> able<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.500> get

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
whatever I wanted and I was able to get

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.590 
whatever I wanted and I was able to get
it<00:01:13.740> done<00:01:13.890> pretty<00:01:14.520> quickly<00:01:16.549> but<00:01:17.549> it<00:01:17.850> was<00:01:18.420> there

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
it done pretty quickly but it was there

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.370 
it done pretty quickly but it was there
was<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.720> lot<00:01:18.930> more<00:01:18.960> pressure<00:01:20.060> having<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.689> just

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
was a lot more pressure having to just

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.990 
was a lot more pressure having to just
come<00:01:22.650> up<00:01:22.680> with<00:01:22.950> something<00:01:23.400> that<00:01:23.430> nothing

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
come up with something that nothing

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.670 
come up with something that nothing
rather<00:01:24.210> than<00:01:24.360> than<00:01:24.930> having<00:01:25.290> you<00:01:25.560> know

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
rather than than having you know

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.830 
rather than than having you know
basically<00:01:26.159> everything<00:01:26.670> before<00:01:27.119> me<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.720> I

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
basically everything before me and I

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.060 
basically everything before me and I
made<00:01:28.080> some<00:01:28.320> I<00:01:28.470> made<00:01:28.590> some<00:01:28.619> decisions<00:01:31.070> but

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
made some I made some decisions but

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.700 
made some I made some decisions but
overall<00:01:32.930> you<00:01:33.930> know<00:01:33.960> I<00:01:34.079> just<00:01:34.290> had<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.439> draw<00:01:34.590> the

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
overall you know I just had to draw the

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.920 
overall you know I just had to draw the
song<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.369> angler<00:01:36.240> fish<00:01:36.420> is<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.720> good<00:01:36.840> example

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
song and angler fish is a good example

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.569 
song and angler fish is a good example
of<00:01:37.259> something<00:01:37.439> that<00:01:37.560> was<00:01:37.710> just<00:01:37.740> really<00:01:38.220> simple

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
of something that was just really simple

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.370 
of something that was just really simple
when<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:39.479> do<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.750> pencil<00:01:40.229> sketch<00:01:41.720> it<00:01:42.720> doesn't

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
when I do a pencil sketch it doesn't

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.170 
when I do a pencil sketch it doesn't
really<00:01:43.470> look<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:43.890> lot<00:01:44.040> different<00:01:44.100> than<00:01:44.610> what

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
really look a lot different than what

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.200 
really look a lot different than what
you<00:01:45.329> actually<00:01:45.509> see<00:01:46.229> in<00:01:46.500> the

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
you actually see in the

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.370 
you actually see in the
I<00:01:48.859> don't<00:01:49.859> typically<00:01:50.390> fill<00:01:51.390> in<00:01:51.600> large<00:01:51.929> black

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
I don't typically fill in large black

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.520 
I don't typically fill in large black
spaces<00:01:52.829> with<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.399> pencil<00:01:53.609> so<00:01:54.450> it's<00:01:54.960> usually<00:01:55.500> a

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
spaces with the pencil so it's usually a

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.080 
spaces with the pencil so it's usually a
lot<00:01:55.649> of<00:01:55.799> lines<00:01:56.039> but<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.369> lot<00:01:56.520> of<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.700> detail

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
lot of lines but a lot of the detail

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.289 
lot of lines but a lot of the detail
lines<00:01:57.299> like<00:01:57.630> on<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.929> fish<00:01:59.090> stuff<00:02:00.090> like<00:02:00.270> that

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
lines like on the fish stuff like that

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.830 
lines like on the fish stuff like that
is<00:02:00.750> usually<00:02:01.200> kind<00:02:01.740> of<00:02:01.979> put<00:02:02.490> in<00:02:02.640> there<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.149> then

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
is usually kind of put in there and then

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.270 
is usually kind of put in there and then
I'll<00:02:03.959> go<00:02:04.170> over<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:04.590> I<00:02:04.649> don't<00:02:04.799> always<00:02:04.920> go<00:02:05.250> over

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
I'll go over and I don't always go over

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.880 
I'll go over and I don't always go over
it<00:02:05.670> exactly<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.630> way<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:06.899> put<00:02:07.229> it<00:02:07.319> in<00:02:07.409> there<00:02:07.649> I

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
it exactly the way I put it in there I

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.199 
it exactly the way I put it in there I
don't<00:02:08.580> I<00:02:08.729> don't<00:02:08.759> really<00:02:09.149> do<00:02:09.299> a<00:02:09.330> lot<00:02:09.450> of

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
don't I don't really do a lot of

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.059 
don't I don't really do a lot of
touching<00:02:12.209> up<00:02:12.299> or<00:02:12.450> anything<00:02:12.540> on<00:02:13.019> the<00:02:13.590> computer

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
touching up or anything on the computer

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.729 
touching up or anything on the computer
I<00:02:14.280> usually<00:02:14.819> finish<00:02:15.360> something<00:02:15.569> and<00:02:15.989> then<00:02:16.470> set

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
I usually finish something and then set

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:18.680 
I usually finish something and then set
the<00:02:16.830> contrast<00:02:17.370> really<00:02:17.730> high<00:02:17.879> and<00:02:18.180> so<00:02:18.540> it's

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
the contrast really high and so it's

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.500 
the contrast really high and so it's
really<00:02:18.750> black<00:02:19.260> and<00:02:19.739> really<00:02:20.040> white<00:02:20.510> but

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
really black and really white but

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:22.550 
really black and really white but
otherwise<00:02:21.690> I<00:02:21.810> don't<00:02:21.959> mess<00:02:22.140> with<00:02:22.319> it<00:02:22.349> a<00:02:22.470> whole

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
otherwise I don't mess with it a whole

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.460 
otherwise I don't mess with it a whole
lot<00:02:22.650> but<00:02:22.950> on<00:02:23.160> this<00:02:23.310> one<00:02:23.930> there<00:02:24.930> was<00:02:25.140> black

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
lot but on this one there was black

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.830 
lot but on this one there was black
filled<00:02:25.799> in<00:02:26.010> so<00:02:26.730> that<00:02:26.760> was<00:02:27.000> that's<00:02:27.510> a<00:02:27.660> real

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
filled in so that was that's a real

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.720 
filled in so that was that's a real
simple<00:02:28.230> one<00:02:28.410> the<00:02:29.099> other<00:02:29.220> one<00:02:29.280> I'll<00:02:29.489> show<00:02:29.670> you

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
simple one the other one I'll show you

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:30.770 
simple one the other one I'll show you
which<00:02:29.910> is<00:02:29.940> a<00:02:30.060> little<00:02:30.150> bit<00:02:30.329> more<00:02:30.420> complicated

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
which is a little bit more complicated

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.199 
which is a little bit more complicated
is<00:02:31.170> the<00:02:31.319> one<00:02:31.500> for<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.459> fathers<00:02:32.940> of<00:02:32.970> the

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
is the one for the fathers of the

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.110 
is the one for the fathers of the
founding<00:02:33.540> fathers<00:02:34.670> which<00:02:35.670> I'll<00:02:35.819> it's<00:02:36.060> a

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
founding fathers which I'll it's a

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.690 
founding fathers which I'll it's a
little<00:02:36.390> bit<00:02:36.510> more<00:02:36.920> creative<00:02:37.920> about<00:02:38.190> because<00:02:38.640> I

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
little bit more creative about because I

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.979 
little bit more creative about because I
wasn't<00:02:38.879> really<00:02:39.150> sure<00:02:41.629> she<00:02:42.629> thought<00:02:42.810> isn't

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
wasn't really sure she thought isn't

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:44.569 
wasn't really sure she thought isn't
really<00:02:43.230> sure<00:02:43.379> what<00:02:43.590> to<00:02:43.709> draw<00:02:43.920> and<00:02:44.129> then<00:02:44.459> this

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579 
really sure what to draw and then this

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:46.490 
really sure what to draw and then this
one<00:02:44.640> I<00:02:44.790> made<00:02:44.849> some<00:02:45.329> some<00:02:45.690> decisions<00:02:46.200> so<00:02:46.410> you

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
one I made some some decisions so you

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.990 
one I made some some decisions so you
know<00:02:46.590> left<00:02:46.799> out<00:02:47.010> some<00:02:47.280> of<00:02:47.430> the<00:02:47.519> characters

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
know left out some of the characters

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.259 
know left out some of the characters
that<00:02:48.239> Hank<00:02:49.079> mentions<00:02:49.560> and<00:02:49.799> this<00:02:50.310> one<00:02:50.519> i<00:02:50.549> really

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
that Hank mentions and this one i really

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.780 
that Hank mentions and this one i really
wish<00:02:51.510> i<00:02:51.599> had<00:02:51.750> the<00:02:52.230> pencil<00:02:52.680> sketches<00:02:53.069> to<00:02:53.400> to

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
wish i had the pencil sketches to to

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.599 
wish i had the pencil sketches to to
compare<00:02:54.180> to<00:02:54.440> especially<00:02:55.440> as<00:02:55.889> it<00:02:56.250> goes<00:02:56.459> along

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:56.609 
compare to especially as it goes along

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:58.069 
compare to especially as it goes along
but<00:02:57.060> yeah<00:02:57.239> I<00:02:57.299> don't<00:02:57.599> really<00:02:57.690> think<00:02:57.870> there's

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
but yeah I don't really think there's

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:00.559 
but yeah I don't really think there's
anything<00:02:58.380> that<00:02:58.560> I'm<00:02:58.769> doing<00:02:58.799> that's<00:02:59.280> like<00:02:59.569> you

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
totally finished are pretty fun but the

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.659 
totally finished are pretty fun but the
stuff<00:04:30.960> in<00:04:31.110> between<00:04:31.260> usually<00:04:32.070> seems<00:04:32.400> like<00:04:32.640> a

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:32.669 
stuff in between usually seems like a

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:36.890 
stuff in between usually seems like a
bit<00:04:32.940> of<00:04:32.970> work<00:04:33.330> and<00:04:33.630> I<00:04:34.050> spend<00:04:34.320> a<00:04:34.410> lot<00:04:34.440> of<00:04:34.620> vm<00:04:35.900> the

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
bit of work and I spend a lot of vm the

bit of work and I spend a lot of vm the
actual<00:04:37.320> drawing<00:04:38.010> part<00:04:38.220> spent<00:04:39.090> a<00:04:39.120> lot<00:04:39.270> of<00:04:39.300> that

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
actual drawing part spent a lot of that

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.890 
actual drawing part spent a lot of that
time<00:04:40.250> looking<00:04:41.250> at<00:04:41.370> they<00:04:41.850> know<00:04:42.000> photos<00:04:42.660> for

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
time looking at they know photos for

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.219 
time looking at they know photos for
reference<00:04:43.020> or<00:04:43.820> erasing<00:04:44.820> Andrea<00:04:45.270> racing<00:04:45.720> to

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:46.229 
reference or erasing Andrea racing to

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:47.719 
reference or erasing Andrea racing to
get<00:04:46.350> something<00:04:46.710> to<00:04:46.770> look<00:04:46.919> right<00:04:47.190> and<00:04:47.400> so<00:04:47.550> that

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:47.729 
get something to look right and so that

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:49.909 
get something to look right and so that
that<00:04:48.150> part<00:04:48.479> is<00:04:48.630> pretty<00:04:48.810> can<00:04:49.620> be<00:04:49.740> pretty

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 
that part is pretty can be pretty

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:52.159 
that part is pretty can be pretty
frustrating<00:04:50.160> and<00:04:50.820> then<00:04:51.300> and<00:04:51.600> then<00:04:51.660> going<00:04:51.900> back

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:52.169 
frustrating and then and then going back

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:56.240 
frustrating and then and then going back
over<00:04:52.410> in<00:04:52.680> ink<00:04:54.080> sometimes<00:04:55.080> it's<00:04:55.440> just<00:04:55.500> utterly

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
over in ink sometimes it's just utterly

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:01.820 
over in ink sometimes it's just utterly
tedious<00:04:57.240> and<00:04:57.740> that's<00:04:58.740> it<00:04:58.979> peace
