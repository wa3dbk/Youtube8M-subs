00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:10.930
 and they are predicting that in just days the 

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:11.830
 Southern California could be shaken 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.559
 by an earthquake of proportions 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:17.320
 catastrophic due to the way in which 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:19.810
 the earth has been aligned with others 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.490
 planets now in villamontes has like 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.830
 through history that alignment 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:27.220
 cosmic has had results 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.810
 devastating that is and according to the 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.550
 scientists earthquakes are the 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.800
 result of the movement of the plates 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.109
 tectonics caused by activity 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.480
 volcanic however we are going to show you 

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:40.210
 how this cosmic alignment could 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:43.260
 be intimately linked with great 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.260
 seismic catastrophes 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.600
 now no mercury and the earth is 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:51.730
 they lined up on March 11, 2011 and the 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.800
 world witnessed the catastrophic 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.890
 tsunami registered in fukushima japan 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.719
 with an intensity of 9.0 degrees in the 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:03.280
 richter scale that devastated the country 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:06.369
 Asian on March 28, 1964 a 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:09.180
 powerful 9.2 earthquake lashed alaska 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:12.610
 having urano venus mercury and mars 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.820
 aligned in what is described as a 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:18.250
 deadly combination according to the Dutch 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.460
 frank herbert that for two years 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.110
 is analyzing the planetary position 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.170
 there are five different alignments of 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:29.740
 planets at a 90 degree angle that 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:32.590
 predict an earthquake of up to 9.8 in 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:36.039
 Southern California next 28 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:38.560
 May at 4 in the afternoon will be when the 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:41.200
 fail of san andrÃ©s enter activity and 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:44.259
 the county of angels would experience 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.929
 a seismic wave similar to the one 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:49.929
 shows this graph according to the astrologer 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:51.270
 European his prediction was born after 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:55.690
 have received the information 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.670
 telepathically they told me that a great 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.550
 earthquake of astro 9.8 would arrive 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:03.100
 nostradamus 500 years ago predicted what 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.890
 it could be the eruption of a volcano or 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.560
 earthquake tremble to very strong in the month 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:11.110
 May jupiter and saturn capricornio 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.350
 mercury will be in taurus also venus 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.450
 cancer and mars in virgo and hail will fall 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.160
 the size of an egg 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.470
 reinaldo saints with more than 200 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.930
 Successful predictions is recognized 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.550
 as the prophet of america and 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.530
 finds meaning in predictions 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.959
 mentioned we will have in the 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.709
 next days a super volcano coming in 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.709
 erupting 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.630
 then that kind of thing the classic 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.810
 that increases the widespread fear of 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:40.750
 people and I tell you something is absolutely right 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.940
 the people in worry because if you go to 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.070
 have an earthquake in the angels the 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.600
 red marks on this map are 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.610
 the main flaws that exist 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.290
 around the world and points 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.350
 yellows are the nerve centers 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:56.990
 more sensitive to registering tremors but 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:59.120
 the cosmo would also have the answer 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.680
 only 10 earthquakes that have hit the 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.740
 Earth have reached a greater magnitude 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.800
 at 8.8 degrees on Richter scale and 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:09.380
 if the predictions do not fail this 28 of 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.720
 may california could suffer serious 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.300
 structural damage caused by the 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.190
 mother nature i 'm jorge miramontes 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.750
 we go back to the studio well there are many 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.890
 predictions that constantly fail 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.300
 so I hope that our 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.250
 viewers these do not take away their sleep 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.260
 I think that analysis a little bit 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.610
 alarmist and it has always been known that 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.830
 one day there will be a big earthquake in 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:30.080
 california does not mean it's the 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:33.490
 next week so anyway it's 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:35.750
 an interesting topic to explore 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.550
 human 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.160
 every time life shakes us 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:42.530
 unexpectedly we give appointment and 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.190
 we investigate so that you are well 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.190
 informed 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.650
 on the radio we are connected with 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:54.370
 our community with your needs and 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:57.689
 your urgencies to the 43 centers we are your 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.689
 first front of information
