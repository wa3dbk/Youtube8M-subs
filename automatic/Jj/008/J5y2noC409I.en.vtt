00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:04.540
 Okay, now I'll do a summary of the concept 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.190
 al-ahmar and Swatch 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:07.520
 family 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.739
 Rome SID bacteria 

00:00:09.739 --> 00:00:13.809
 And so that bacteria can cause damage to us it must first by the 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:16.840
 The first episode of this show would be the skin 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.949
 if the skin breaks it can be 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:26.070
 Bacteria can spread to bouts the bacteria of those 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.509
 Skin is values 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:28.330
 similar 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.570
 The nonspecific avoids however refers to the oceans as well as the 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.650
 nonspecific humor ladies defense mechanisms shepherd calls 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:37.980
 therefore not 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.790
 Springer offers back so here 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.460
 I am in the team and won the granulocytes 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.429
 as well as the compliment and this year are components of the blood 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.200
 and they come out of the cloud 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.980
 Now the bacterium on Fressgasse just lunches monozygies betting that 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.090
 on food 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:00.840
 the compliment 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.850
 that feels right now 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:04.670
 No 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.870
 this makes the bacterium tasteless 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.180
 For the granulocytes notes that the bacteria eat better 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.570
 can be through the chamber to do the murder 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.650
 or getting back the compliment also destroying the bacterium 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.680
 because that does not work 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.310
 also that a specific on the area is allowed exactly this bacterium 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.890
 is no longer enough for the granulocytes to be here a bit 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.890
 scarce moved we need the big guns 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.350
 and now there are the lymphocytes in the game that have lymphocytes with fellows 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.870
 the produce comes the heads of these narratives are these and the car 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.300
 the band is much stronger now and this bacterium is a dream too 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.030
 You can send the bacteria really good for food 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.540
 that is the whipped cream which they then stroke on this bacterium if 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.700
 the compliment point the cells alone are not enough come on the heads 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.360
 and as we have seen, the lymphocytes are very specific 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.480
 Title single lymphocytes 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.049
 has a specialty for an important bacterium 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:14.619
 and for that to learn something fourth park of the boys 

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:19.529
 To build a specificity of baptism, they first need internal type and thymus 

00:02:19.529 --> 00:02:20.749
 is the so-called 

00:02:20.749 --> 00:02:23.629
 after a forced 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:27.840
 Spencer and so that can happen here that this specific 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.989
 also will be activated 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:35.810
 You must sift through the kindergarten as well as contain ingredients around the bacteria 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.930
 In the Fruits of the Mountain the puppy is sent on 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.429
 Wied the lymph nodes as we have seen 

00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:46.749
 but there are other devices such as the drums are the center cell 

00:02:46.749 --> 00:02:48.689
 immediately warned the moon 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:50.989
 So that's not really a bad thing 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:56.089
 Piece was selected with the lymph nodes there, the lymphocytes also activated 

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:59.259
 just as there are only professional choices in the top ten driving 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:04.899
 "Night at it leads us to a very huge surface 

00:03:04.899 --> 00:03:06.209
 led 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.369
 for the herd of infection Hackett 

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:12.239
 and because diets like batches of bacteria we eat there 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.079
 Feeling is the chosen assist 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:15.109
 most 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:20.180
 Lymph nodes could be said there armchairs pass a lot of stuff like that 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.859
 Do specific Aberrant SZ right starts when activated 

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:28.729
 and now I have another document 

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:31.510
 These bacteria are dry here in the skin 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.770
 So what happens when we put virtually everyone in our blood right now? 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:37.269
 injected 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:38.469
 There is also 

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:42.689
 Bacteria directly into the blood, there must happen something 

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:47.249
 and Trine Blood counted me very many chains of these are yes 

00:03:47.249 --> 00:03:51.719
 usually just and the most fair the bacterium threatens right away 

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:55.609
 even if there are many bacteria now, these get into the girls 

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:57.130
 Mills 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:02.360
 where is the Milter pulling the left upper abdomen so left above in the left 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.069
 on top of each the last twenty meters and here is the spleen 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:10.659
 and there are quite a few of these motives now and quite a few of them 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:12.279
 these lymphocytes 

00:04:12.279 --> 00:04:16.150
 This is where the BAG Education is best filtered out 

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:20.449
 so the far and the cinema has to sum up the bacteria 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:23.800
 first through the skin then through the nonspecific devaluation by the 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.539
 specific from the world 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:28.809
 and the unspecific defense is now made up of no notes 

00:04:28.809 --> 00:04:31.960
 Momo Ziethen and complement us the line 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.430
 the specific holds off 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.600
 is the lymphocytes there is the type that finally must be the chars 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.870
 School for the Lymphozyten many advantages also produces the approx 

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:45.330
 which look like compliment could be a bit better 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.649
 you say
