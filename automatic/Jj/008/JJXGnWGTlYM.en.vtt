00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
existing grassland so this is an

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.060 
existing grassland so this is an

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
overview so you can see I've left it in

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.970 
overview so you can see I've left it in

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
layers so you can kind of see the

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.849 
layers so you can kind of see the
process<00:00:23.430> so<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.480> two<00:00:24.660> steaks<00:00:25.260> at<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.470> end<00:00:25.710> of

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
process so the two steaks at the end of

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.220 
process so the two steaks at the end of
the<00:00:25.920> markers<00:00:26.369> here<00:00:27.330> so<00:00:27.570> first<00:00:27.840> thing<00:00:28.050> to<00:00:28.109> do<00:00:28.199> is

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
the markers here so first thing to do is

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.750 
the markers here so first thing to do is
Mark<00:00:28.500> out<00:00:28.740> your<00:00:28.890> area<00:00:29.189> make<00:00:29.369> sure<00:00:29.400> it's<00:00:29.609> nice

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:31.489 
and square or whatever shape you want

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:34.160 
and square or whatever shape you want
then<00:00:32.489> I've<00:00:32.610> got<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:32.850> remove<00:00:33.090> all<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.390> grass<00:00:33.630> so

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
then I've got to remove all the grass so

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.840 
then I've got to remove all the grass so
I'm<00:00:34.620> literally<00:00:35.040> going<00:00:35.340> along<00:00:35.610> with<00:00:35.760> the

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
I'm literally going along with the

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.060 
I'm literally going along with the
shovel<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.270> taking<00:00:36.660> up<00:00:36.780> off<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.860> top<00:00:38.040> layer

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
shovel and taking up off the top layer

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.819 
shovel and taking up off the top layer
of<00:00:38.280> grass<00:00:38.790> you<00:00:39.660> can<00:00:39.809> see<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.110> where<00:00:40.469> it's<00:00:40.590> flat

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
of grass you can see the where it's flat

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.700 
of grass you can see the where it's flat
there<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.840> then<00:00:42.840> where<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.200> shovel<00:00:43.530> is

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
there and then where the shovel is

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.799 
there and then where the shovel is
that's<00:00:44.460> where<00:00:44.610> I'm<00:00:44.730> turning<00:00:45.149> it<00:00:45.239> over<00:00:45.420> and

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
that's where I'm turning it over and

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:52.990 
that's where I'm turning it over and
then<00:00:46.219> this<00:00:47.219> point<00:00:47.520> here<00:00:48.890> is<00:00:49.890> just<00:00:50.280> where<00:00:50.670> I'm

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
then this point here is just where I'm

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.639 
then this point here is just where I'm
raking<00:00:54.000> it<00:00:54.300> over<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:54.780> just<00:00:54.899> breaking<00:00:55.320> it<00:00:55.440> up<00:00:55.500> a

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
raking it over and just breaking it up a

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.599 
raking it over and just breaking it up a
little<00:00:55.770> bit<00:00:57.440> so<00:00:58.440> far<00:00:58.770> this<00:00:59.010> is<00:00:59.129> going<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.370> be<00:00:59.489> an

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
little bit so far this is going to be an

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.549 
little bit so far this is going to be an
asparagus<00:01:00.030> bed<00:01:00.329> so<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:00.600> should<00:01:00.840> get<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:01.170> little

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
asparagus bed so you should get a little

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:02.720 
asparagus bed so you should get a little
going<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:01.920> come<00:01:02.039> back<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.219> little<00:01:02.399> bit<00:01:02.520> further

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
going to come back a little bit further

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.170 
going to come back a little bit further
so<00:01:03.120> i'll<00:01:03.300> probably<00:01:03.480> get<00:01:03.660> about<00:01:04.489> 70<00:01:05.489> crowns<00:01:05.790> in

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
so i'll probably get about 70 crowns in

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.140 
so i'll probably get about 70 crowns in
their<00:01:06.510> 60<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.110> 70<00:01:07.610> so<00:01:08.610> we'll<00:01:08.760> see<00:01:08.909> how<00:01:08.939> we<00:01:09.060> go

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
their 60 to 70 so we'll see how we go

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.850 
their 60 to 70 so we'll see how we go
but<00:01:10.549> we'll<00:01:11.549> see<00:01:11.670> what<00:01:11.790> happens<00:01:11.909> but<00:01:12.600> i'll<00:01:12.860> show

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
but we'll see what happens but i'll show

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.140 
but we'll see what happens but i'll show
you<00:01:13.920> what<00:01:14.070> i'm<00:01:14.159> doing<00:01:14.430> alright<00:01:14.520> so<00:01:14.939> bear<00:01:15.119> with

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.680 

alright<00:01:20.680> so<00:01:21.460> this<00:01:21.880> is<00:01:22.030> the<00:01:22.180> area<00:01:22.330> where<00:01:22.570> I'm

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
alright so this is the area where I'm

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.130 
alright so this is the area where I'm
actually<00:01:22.840> just<00:01:23.140> digging<00:01:23.500> up<00:01:23.590> the<00:01:23.740> graphs

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
actually just digging up the graphs

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.690 
actually just digging up the graphs
literally<00:01:26.140> just<00:01:26.350> going<00:01:26.650> along<00:01:26.770> with<00:01:27.520> the

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
literally just going along with the

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.700 
literally just going along with the
shovel<00:01:28.240> and<00:01:28.570> scraping<00:01:29.110> underneath<00:01:29.500> and

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
shovel and scraping underneath and

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:30.990 
shovel and scraping underneath and
taking<00:01:30.070> it<00:01:30.190> off<00:01:30.280> so<00:01:30.640> it's<00:01:30.820> a<00:01:30.850> bit

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
taking it off so it's a bit

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.810 
taking it off so it's a bit
labor-intensive<00:01:32.430> it's<00:01:33.430> been<00:01:33.670> a<00:01:34.360> job<00:01:35.050> so<00:01:35.680> far

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
labor-intensive it's been a job so far

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.090 
labor-intensive it's been a job so far
so<00:01:36.820> once<00:01:37.390> you've<00:01:37.540> got<00:01:37.690> that<00:01:37.840> done<00:01:38.110> then<00:01:38.920> you'll

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
so once you've got that done then you'll

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.740 
so once you've got that done then you'll
have<00:01:39.220> this<00:01:39.369> bare<00:01:39.610> patch<00:01:39.850> now<00:01:40.210> what<00:01:40.390> I'm<00:01:40.479> doing

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750

nice and loosely with the shovel and
then<00:02:16.560> just<00:02:17.560> breaking<00:02:18.010> it<00:02:18.100> over<00:02:18.370> there<00:02:18.930> like

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
then just breaking it over there like

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:26.400 
then just breaking it over there like
that<00:02:23.190> so<00:02:24.540> sorry<00:02:25.540> the<00:02:25.660> chickens<00:02:25.989> are<00:02:26.140> having<00:02:26.350> a

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
that so sorry the chickens are having a

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.460 
that so sorry the chickens are having a
bit<00:02:26.560> of<00:02:26.590> a<00:02:27.150> with<00:02:28.150> a<00:02:28.180> battle<00:02:28.570> royale<00:02:28.780> going<00:02:29.350> on

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
bit of a with a battle royale going on

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.530 
bit of a with a battle royale going on
in<00:02:29.620> there<00:02:29.829> at<00:02:29.920> the<00:02:30.010> moment<00:02:30.420> pretty<00:02:31.420> active<00:02:31.720> so

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
in there at the moment pretty active so

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.880 
in there at the moment pretty active so
that's<00:02:34.540> basically<00:02:34.720> it<00:02:35.140> once<00:02:35.440> you<00:02:35.530> scrape<00:02:35.769> the

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
that's basically it once you scrape the

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.289 
that's basically it once you scrape the
top<00:02:36.070> layer<00:02:36.280> off<00:02:36.310> special<00:02:36.940> if<00:02:37.000> you've<00:02:37.120> got

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 
top layer off special if you've got

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:40.289 
top layer off special if you've got
buffalo<00:02:37.630> things<00:02:38.049> like<00:02:38.200> that<00:02:38.350> onion<00:02:39.220> we'd<00:02:39.430> get

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299 
buffalo things like that onion we'd get

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:44.420 
buffalo things like that onion we'd get
rid<00:02:40.450> of<00:02:40.480> that<00:02:40.650> and<00:02:41.650> then<00:02:41.799> turn<00:02:42.130> it<00:02:42.160> over<00:02:43.140> just

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
rid of that and then turn it over just

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.590 
rid of that and then turn it over just
loosely<00:02:45.430> and<00:02:45.670> then<00:02:45.880> you<00:02:45.970> can<00:02:46.120> go<00:02:46.239> over<00:02:46.390> with

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
loosely and then you can go over with

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.090 
loosely and then you can go over with
the<00:02:46.720> rake<00:02:46.900> and<00:02:47.200> turn<00:02:47.440> it<00:02:47.560> over<00:02:47.680> from<00:02:47.859> there

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
the rake and turn it over from there

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.069 
the rake and turn it over from there
when<00:02:48.760> you're<00:02:48.880> actually<00:02:49.060> raking<00:02:49.660> it<00:02:49.780> through

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:50.079 
when you're actually raking it through

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:51.569 
when you're actually raking it through
it<00:02:50.320> gives<00:02:50.500> you<00:02:50.590> another<00:02:50.739> opportunity<00:02:50.829> to<00:02:51.370> get

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:51.579 
it gives you another opportunity to get

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:55.620 
it gives you another opportunity to get
through<00:02:52.290> any<00:02:53.290> weed<00:02:53.890> tetra<00:02:54.640> buffalo<00:02:55.180> stuff

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
through any weed tetra buffalo stuff

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:56.940 
through any weed tetra buffalo stuff
like<00:02:55.750> that<00:02:55.780> that<00:02:55.900> might<00:02:56.170> be<00:02:56.350> existing<00:02:56.799> in

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
like that that might be existing in

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.220 
like that that might be existing in
there<00:02:57.130> as<00:02:57.250> well<00:02:57.480> so<00:02:58.480> this<00:02:58.660> is<00:02:58.780> it<00:02:58.930> i'll<00:02:59.049> come

real pain so like big area be easy just
to<00:03:11.890> come<00:03:12.070> in<00:03:12.190> with<00:03:12.310> like<00:03:12.609> a<00:03:12.640> dingo<00:03:13.060> like<00:03:13.269> a

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
to come in with like a dingo like a

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.240 
to come in with like a dingo like a
bobcat<00:03:16.170> scrape<00:03:17.170> off<00:03:17.320> the<00:03:17.350> top<00:03:17.650> layer<00:03:17.680> and<00:03:18.130> then

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
bobcat scrape off the top layer and then

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.039 
bobcat scrape off the top layer and then
get<00:03:18.400> a<00:03:18.430> rotary<00:03:18.820> hoe<00:03:19.030> or<00:03:19.060> cold<00:03:19.540> the<00:03:19.660> vader<00:03:19.840> and

get a rotary hoe or cold the vader and

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:22.620 
get a rotary hoe or cold the vader and
then<00:03:20.739> just<00:03:20.920> turn<00:03:21.070> it<00:03:21.220> all<00:03:21.340> over<00:03:21.480> fill<00:03:22.480> that

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
then just turn it all over fill that

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.259 
then just turn it all over fill that
stuff<00:03:22.900> costs<00:03:23.170> money<00:03:23.170> having<00:03:23.859> that<00:03:23.890> the<00:03:24.070> money

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
stuff costs money having that the money

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.950 
stuff costs money having that the money
comes<00:03:25.269> do<00:03:25.390> it<00:03:25.450> by<00:03:25.600> hand

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:26.960 
comes do it by hand

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.200 
comes do it by hand
so<00:03:27.960> that's<00:03:28.140> it<00:03:28.290> just<00:03:28.770> the<00:03:28.980> new<00:03:29.130> garden<00:03:29.520> bed<00:03:29.700> and

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.210 
so that's it just the new garden bed and

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:31.520 
so that's it just the new garden bed and
that's<00:03:30.390> basically<00:03:30.600> how<00:03:30.810> to<00:03:30.960> do<00:03:31.140> one<00:03:31.290> if<00:03:31.410> you've

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
that's basically how to do one if you've

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.610 
that's basically how to do one if you've
got<00:03:31.650> an<00:03:31.740> existing<00:03:32.130> grass<00:03:32.720> area<00:03:33.720> draw<00:03:34.350> it<00:03:34.500> out

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
got an existing grass area draw it out

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.160 
got an existing grass area draw it out
take<00:03:35.400> off<00:03:35.580> the<00:03:35.700> top<00:03:35.880> layer<00:03:35.910> of<00:03:36.210> grass<00:03:36.480> turn<00:03:37.020> it

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
take off the top layer of grass turn it

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.470 
take off the top layer of grass turn it
over<00:03:37.320> and<00:03:37.590> then<00:03:37.920> just<00:03:38.130> Pharaoh<00:03:39.060> it<00:03:39.300> a<00:03:39.330> little

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
over and then just Pharaoh it a little

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.660 
over and then just Pharaoh it a little
bit<00:03:39.690> rake<00:03:39.930> it<00:03:40.110> through<00:03:40.380> just<00:03:41.070> to<00:03:41.100> loosen<00:03:41.370> it<00:03:41.610> up

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
bit rake it through just to loosen it up

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.070 
bit rake it through just to loosen it up
and<00:03:41.820> then<00:03:41.910> you<00:03:41.940> can<00:03:42.150> be<00:03:42.300> pretty<00:03:42.630> much<00:03:42.780> plant

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
and then you can be pretty much plant

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.780 
and then you can be pretty much plant
from<00:03:43.260> there<00:03:43.500> depending<00:03:43.920> on<00:03:44.190> what<00:03:44.340> the<00:03:44.430> soils

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
from there depending on what the soils

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.050 
from there depending on what the soils
like<00:03:45.380> if<00:03:46.380> it's<00:03:46.560> a<00:03:46.620> good<00:03:46.740> soil<00:03:47.070> you<00:03:47.760> don't<00:03:47.970> have

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
like if it's a good soil you don't have

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.430 
like if it's a good soil you don't have
to<00:03:48.180> add<00:03:48.300> anything<00:03:48.600> to<00:03:48.750> it<00:03:48.870> you<00:03:49.020> might<00:03:49.170> want<00:03:49.380> to

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
to add anything to it you might want to

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.960 
to add anything to it you might want to
add<00:03:49.530> manure<00:03:49.860> and<00:03:50.070> stuff<00:03:50.310> to<00:03:50.460> it<00:03:50.580> when<00:03:50.700> you<00:03:50.790> turn

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
add manure and stuff to it when you turn

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.420 
add manure and stuff to it when you turn
it<00:03:51.000> over<00:03:51.270> but<00:03:51.890> this<00:03:52.890> is<00:03:53.040> pretty<00:03:53.190> good

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
it over but this is pretty good

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.040 
it over but this is pretty good
