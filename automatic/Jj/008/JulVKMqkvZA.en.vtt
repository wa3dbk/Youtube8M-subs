straight<00:00:14.830> after<00:00:15.009> an<00:00:15.250> early<00:00:15.490> breakfast<00:00:15.910> we

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:16.209 
straight after an early breakfast we

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:18.390 
straight after an early breakfast we
headed<00:00:16.450> over<00:00:16.540> to<00:00:16.779> the<00:00:16.900> tan<00:00:17.110> Bow<00:00:17.320> River<00:00:17.500> we<00:00:18.279> were

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:18.400 
headed over to the tan Bow River we were

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.040 
headed over to the tan Bow River we were
picking<00:00:18.610> up<00:00:18.849> large<00:00:19.119> schools<00:00:19.509> of<00:00:19.660> fish<00:00:19.779> on<00:00:19.960> the

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:20.050 
picking up large schools of fish on the

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:21.630 
picking up large schools of fish on the
sounder<00:00:20.470> so<00:00:20.770> things<00:00:21.009> were<00:00:21.130> looking<00:00:21.250> promising

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:21.640 
sounder so things were looking promising

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.030 
sounder so things were looking promising
but<00:00:22.300> we<00:00:22.419> got<00:00:22.570> off<00:00:22.720> to<00:00:22.750> a<00:00:22.869> fairly<00:00:23.259> slow<00:00:23.500> start<00:00:23.860> as

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:24.040 
but we got off to a fairly slow start as

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.979 
but we got off to a fairly slow start as
it<00:00:24.460> seemed<00:00:24.669> like<00:00:24.849> only<00:00:25.090> small<00:00:25.630> bream<00:00:25.869> were

00:00:25.979 --> 00:00:25.989 
it seemed like only small bream were

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:38.520 
it seemed like only small bream were
taking<00:00:26.380> our<00:00:26.529> lures<00:00:36.990> what<00:00:37.990> we're<00:00:38.110> doing<00:00:38.350> here

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 
taking our lures what we're doing here

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:39.690 
taking our lures what we're doing here
in<00:00:38.590> the<00:00:38.650> tan<00:00:38.860> bows<00:00:39.070> are<00:00:39.250> trying<00:00:39.460> to<00:00:39.550> locate

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:39.700 
in the tan bows are trying to locate

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.330 
in the tan bows are trying to locate
these<00:00:40.120> schools<00:00:40.540> of<00:00:40.780> spawning<00:00:41.110> brim<00:00:41.530> using<00:00:42.220> our

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:42.340 
these schools of spawning brim using our

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.040 
these schools of spawning brim using our
sound<00:00:42.640> drive<00:00:42.820> got<00:00:43.000> to<00:00:43.210> sounders<00:00:43.600> on<00:00:43.750> this<00:00:43.870> but

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.050 
sound drive got to sounders on this but

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.450 
sound drive got to sounders on this but
I've<00:00:44.170> got<00:00:44.290> an<00:00:44.380> eight-inch<00:00:44.740> Lawrence<00:00:45.100> at<00:00:45.340> the

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
I've got an eight-inch Lawrence at the

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.400 
I've got an eight-inch Lawrence at the
helm<00:00:45.700> and<00:00:46.060> then<00:00:46.360> I've<00:00:46.480> got<00:00:46.510> this<00:00:46.780> smaller<00:00:47.110> 5

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.410 
helm and then I've got this smaller 5

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.940 
helm and then I've got this smaller 5
inch<00:00:47.590> version<00:00:47.860> here<00:00:48.520> now<00:00:49.090> the<00:00:49.810> transducer<00:00:50.800> for

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:50.950 
inch version here now the transducer for

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.710 
inch version here now the transducer for
this<00:00:51.100> Lawrence<00:00:51.610> is<00:00:51.850> actually<00:00:52.180> connected<00:00:52.420> to

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:52.720 
this Lawrence is actually connected to

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.180 
this Lawrence is actually connected to
the<00:00:52.810> bottom<00:00:53.079> of<00:00:53.140> the<00:00:53.230> water<00:00:53.440> snake<00:00:53.739> so<00:00:53.950> I<00:00:53.980> get<00:00:54.160> a

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
the bottom of the water snake so I get a

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.069 
the bottom of the water snake so I get a
really<00:00:54.550> direct<00:00:55.150> picture<00:00:55.630> of<00:00:55.720> where<00:00:55.930> on

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:56.079 
really direct picture of where on

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:57.690 
really direct picture of where on
fishing<00:00:56.470> now<00:00:56.800> one<00:00:56.980> little<00:00:57.220> trick<00:00:57.430> that<00:00:57.489> I

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:57.700 
fishing now one little trick that I

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.400 
fishing now one little trick that I
think<00:00:58.030> a<00:00:58.120> lot<00:00:58.239> of<00:00:58.270> people<00:00:58.360> don't<00:00:59.110> do<00:00:59.230> well

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.410 
think a lot of people don't do well

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:00.690 
think a lot of people don't do well
enough<00:00:59.530> with<00:00:59.770> Sanders<00:01:00.190> is<00:01:00.340> use<00:01:00.520> their

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:00.700 
enough with Sanders is use their

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.250 
enough with Sanders is use their
sensitivity<00:01:01.360> often<00:01:01.720> enough<00:01:01.960> I've<00:01:02.200> just

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
sensitivity often enough I've just

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.920 
sensitivity often enough I've just
stopped<00:01:03.220> the<00:01:03.340> screen<00:01:03.730> and<00:01:04.000> at<00:01:04.299> the<00:01:04.390> moment<00:01:04.570> you

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
stopped the screen and at the moment you

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.350 
stopped the screen and at the moment you
can<00:01:05.079> see<00:01:05.320> these<00:01:05.530> these<00:01:06.009> little<00:01:06.909> shapes<00:01:07.149> or

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
can see these these little shapes or

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.969 
can see these these little shapes or
arches<00:01:07.750> here<00:01:07.899> they<00:01:07.990> look<00:01:08.170> like<00:01:08.380> arches<00:01:08.799> with<00:01:08.950> a

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
arches here they look like arches with a

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:10.709 
arches here they look like arches with a
bit<00:01:09.189> of<00:01:09.219> a<00:01:09.340> cluster<00:01:09.700> underneath<00:01:10.060> them<00:01:10.270> they're

00:01:10.709 --> 00:01:10.719 
bit of a cluster underneath them they're

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:13.289 
bit of a cluster underneath them they're
all<00:01:10.869> individual<00:01:11.409> brim<00:01:11.740> now<00:01:12.460> I<00:01:12.670> can<00:01:12.909> see<00:01:13.090> them

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:13.299 
all individual brim now I can see them

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:15.870 
all individual brim now I can see them
really<00:01:13.990> really<00:01:14.170> clearly<00:01:14.740> but<00:01:15.369> also<00:01:15.520> you<00:01:15.729> can

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
really really clearly but also you can

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.309 
really really clearly but also you can
see<00:01:15.999> there's<00:01:16.179> quite<00:01:16.240> a<00:01:16.389> lot<00:01:16.479> of<00:01:16.600> clutter<00:01:16.840> on<00:01:17.049> my

00:01:17.309 --> 00:01:17.319 
see there's quite a lot of clutter on my

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:19.919 
see there's quite a lot of clutter on my
screen<00:01:17.649> now<00:01:18.310> as<00:01:18.969> soon<00:01:19.060> as<00:01:19.359> I<00:01:19.450> adjust<00:01:19.600> the

00:01:19.919 --> 00:01:19.929 
screen now as soon as I adjust the

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:22.410 
screen now as soon as I adjust the
sensitivity<00:01:20.229> you'll<00:01:20.770> see<00:01:21.039> that<00:01:21.340> as<00:01:21.490> i<00:01:22.119> get<00:01:22.299> rid

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
sensitivity you'll see that as i get rid

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.669 
sensitivity you'll see that as i get rid
of<00:01:22.509> this<00:01:22.630> clutter<00:01:22.899> and<00:01:23.020> make<00:01:23.229> the<00:01:23.350> screen

00:01:23.669 --> 00:01:23.679 
of this clutter and make the screen

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:26.039 
of this clutter and make the screen
quite<00:01:24.100> clear<00:01:24.429> i'll<00:01:24.729> also<00:01:25.240> lose<00:01:25.689> a<00:01:25.719> lot<00:01:26.020> of

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:26.049 
quite clear i'll also lose a lot of

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:28.830 
quite clear i'll also lose a lot of
these<00:01:26.229> brim<00:01:26.619> so<00:01:27.479> theoretically<00:01:28.479> i<00:01:28.539> might<00:01:28.810> just

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
these brim so theoretically i might just

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.629 
these brim so theoretically i might just
drive<00:01:29.200> past<00:01:29.499> them<00:01:29.799> you<00:01:30.340> know<00:01:30.399> just

00:01:30.629 --> 00:01:30.639 
drive past them you know just

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:32.730 
drive past them you know just
demonstrate<00:01:31.149> how<00:01:31.329> we<00:01:31.359> adjust<00:01:31.959> that<00:01:32.170> we<00:01:32.560> got<00:01:32.709> a

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
demonstrate how we adjust that we got a

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.609 
demonstrate how we adjust that we got a
menu<00:01:33.270> we<00:01:34.270> go<00:01:34.389> over<00:01:34.420> to<00:01:34.659> adjust<00:01:35.109> i<00:01:35.259> never<00:01:35.439> have

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
menu we go over to adjust i never have

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:38.340 
menu we go over to adjust i never have
it<00:01:35.709> on<00:01:35.799> auto<00:01:36.039> sensitivity<00:01:36.789> to<00:01:37.600> go<00:01:37.749> across<00:01:37.990> a

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
it on auto sensitivity to go across a

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.319 
it on auto sensitivity to go across a
now<00:01:38.590> gotten<00:01:38.979> sensitivity<00:01:39.579> percentage<00:01:40.060> at<00:01:40.209> the

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:40.329 
now gotten sensitivity percentage at the

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:43.139 
now gotten sensitivity percentage at the
moment<00:01:40.719> both<00:01:41.139> eighty-one<00:01:41.709> percent<00:01:41.969> so<00:01:42.969> when<00:01:43.119> I

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:43.149 
moment both eighty-one percent so when I

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:46.719 
moment both eighty-one percent so when I
go<00:01:43.389> down

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.660 

you'll<00:01:47.729> see<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.330> screen<00:01:48.659> now<00:01:48.840> is<00:01:48.869> quite<00:01:49.229> clear

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
you'll see the screen now is quite clear

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.219 
you'll see the screen now is quite clear
but<00:01:50.670> those<00:01:50.970> objects<00:01:51.479> all<00:01:51.600> those<00:01:51.720> brim<00:01:52.049> have

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
but those objects all those brim have

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.719 
but those objects all those brim have
pretty<00:01:52.439> well<00:01:52.500> disappeared<00:01:53.130> apart<00:01:53.400> from<00:01:53.580> one

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
pretty well disappeared apart from one

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.910 
pretty well disappeared apart from one
or<00:01:53.880> two<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.390> I<00:01:54.780> don't<00:01:54.990> look<00:01:55.110> that<00:01:55.170> significant

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
or two and I don't look that significant

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.370 
or two and I don't look that significant
anymore<00:01:56.250> as<00:01:56.460> I<00:01:57.240> bring<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.540> sensitivity<00:01:58.200> back

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
anymore as I bring the sensitivity back

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.399 
anymore as I bring the sensitivity back
up<00:01:58.759> to<00:01:59.759> a<00:01:59.790> point<00:02:00.119> where<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.840> screen<00:02:01.110> is<00:02:01.200> quite

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
up to a point where the screen is quite

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.080 
up to a point where the screen is quite
