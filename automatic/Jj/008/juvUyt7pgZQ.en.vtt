00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
like this now what I would recommend is

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:50.120 
like this now what I would recommend is
pulling<00:01:44.770> the<00:01:44.799> strength<00:01:45.280> all<00:01:45.640> the<00:01:45.939> way<00:01:46.060> up<00:01:46.210> and

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.419 

the<00:01:51.130> color<00:01:51.429> saturation<00:01:52.950> don't<00:01:53.950> default<00:01:54.280> if

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:54.429 
the color saturation don't default if

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:55.949 
the color saturation don't default if
you<00:01:54.549> drag<00:01:54.759> that<00:01:54.909> up<00:01:54.969> what<00:01:55.450> this<00:01:55.569> is<00:01:55.750> going<00:01:55.810> to

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:55.959 
you drag that up what this is going to

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:57.660 
you drag that up what this is going to
do<00:01:56.110> is<00:01:56.229> make<00:01:56.409> everything<00:01:56.740> really<00:01:57.069> break<00:01:57.399> on

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
do is make everything really break on

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.230 
do is make everything really break on
the<00:01:57.759> colors<00:01:58.060> right<00:01:58.179> really<00:01:58.810> bright<00:01:59.219> so<00:02:00.240> I'm

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
the colors right really bright so I'm

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.709 
the colors right really bright so I'm
going<00:02:01.390> to<00:02:01.420> bring<00:02:01.539> that<00:02:01.719> down<00:02:01.899> to<00:02:01.959> about<00:02:02.259> Ed<00:02:03.719> ok

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:04.719 
going to bring that down to about Ed ok

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:06.840 
going to bring that down to about Ed ok
now<00:02:04.840> for<00:02:05.020> the<00:02:05.079> lights<00:02:05.319> movement<00:02:05.759> when<00:02:06.759> you

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
now for the lights movement when you

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.250 
now for the lights movement when you
click<00:02:07.119> I<00:02:08.700> more<00:02:09.700> realistic<00:02:10.450> the<00:02:10.720> lighting<00:02:11.110> is

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
click I more realistic the lighting is

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.750 
click I more realistic the lighting is
going<00:02:11.739> to<00:02:11.829> smooth<00:02:12.099> but<00:02:12.880> when<00:02:13.030> you<00:02:13.120> go<00:02:13.269> down<00:02:13.450> to

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
going to smooth but when you go down to

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.660 
going to smooth but when you go down to
very<00:02:15.760> low<00:02:16.230> it's<00:02:17.230> going<00:02:17.380> to<00:02:17.440> give<00:02:17.590> you<00:02:17.709> this<00:02:17.860> so

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
very low it's going to give you this so

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.180 
very low it's going to give you this so
that's<00:02:18.880> the<00:02:18.940> real<00:02:19.269> cartoon<00:02:19.870> you<00:02:19.989> look<00:02:20.200> you
