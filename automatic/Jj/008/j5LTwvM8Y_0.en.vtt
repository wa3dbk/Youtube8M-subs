00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:12.420
 very good 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:16.550
 good to start playing this 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:21.140
 this very simple topic let's start 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:24.840
 placing finger 2 on this 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:27.480
 from this gift we will go down to sun 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.820
 we go back to do 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.880
 again alone 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:36.270
 again 2 and now let's make a 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:39.700
 rise from only again going through 2 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:43.200
 but this time we keep going up to me 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.200
 and we come to sun 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:50.059
 and then we change the position a bit 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.190
 to finger 4 to stefan that will go down to a 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:53.780
 re 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:57.379
 again subelza 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:01.269
 again the king again and now we go down 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:05.430
 king if we go to the net and 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:09.200
 we finish the sentence in sun 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.200
 let's see how the rhythm would be 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.610
 there we have our first sentence 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.210
 the second sentence begins on this 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:30.200
 everything is played twice to make 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.200
 our descent from me 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:37.000
 We repeat twice this do 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:40.140
 and we also repeat this twice 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.140
 we make a ref like that 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.909
 or 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.760
 again the descent from me 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:57.380
 rev have been 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.790
 and this gift is going to be our last note 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.830
 of this sentence and the first of the 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.890
 next as we will see later if what 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:07.330
 we do the rhythm to the time so that 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.330
 see how the rhythm would be 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.329
 no no 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.160
 and 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:28.190
 the left hand we start on me by the 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:31.210
 finger 2 we go down to 2 with the 4 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.210
 we upload the network 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.120
 we go down to me 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.330
 we repeat what we have 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.330
 learned 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.470
 and alone 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.330
 and we would end up being the 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.580
 first note of the next sentence of the 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:58.490
 third let's put them together 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:02.210
 we started with our hands together we have 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:06.920
 said that the left of my right 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:09.290
 from here we repeat from the right now 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.680
 enter the left now between the 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:16.200
 down from the right 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.200
 in the second 2 it enters to the left 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:22.040
 moves the right 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:25.840
 now the left will enter alone 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.840
 then move the right 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.950
 together 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:36.409
 the left the descent 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.680
 until the second they come together 

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:38.680
 new 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.150
 left 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:50.260
 and beginning of the third 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.260
 we do it on time 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.970
 no no 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:05.840
 our third sentence 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:09.830
 we started there 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:12.099
 and we make the times of the dow we change to 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:12.099
 3 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:21.739
 we repeat it with 1 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.739
 we go up to me 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.449
 we change some 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.620
 ah 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.919
 we do it on time 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:45.189
 i 

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:50.760
 the left you see rising from two by 

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:56.630
 scale network until am and then jump to sun 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:56.630
 and again 23 and me 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.419
 what we put together 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.180
 to 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:11.270
 ah 

00:05:08.429 --> 00:05:13.449
 i 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.400
 Y 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:18.370
 plus 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:21.070
 there we have the third sentence let's see 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:23.220
 how the second sentence connects with the 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:27.780
 third portion that have remained doubts 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.780
 we finished the second sentence 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.920
 and we started 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.210
 we have the connection between the second and 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:44.129
 the third and fourth and last 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:46.510
 we started on this sun 

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:48.460
 that goes up 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:49.560
 and now we are moving from alone 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.090
 easy 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.949
 it is repeated three times 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:56.580
 we're going to repeat a fourth one but now 

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:56.580
 with another finger 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:00.990
 we repeat the process 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:07.289
 and now we change this 3 to 2 

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:12.680
 and we finish in everything 

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:18.800
 the left starts on a me 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.480
 schubert fa 

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:25.659
 go down 

00:06:28.209 --> 00:06:31.209
 two 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:34.210
 ah 

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:39.010
 sun and we just seeing 

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.460
 let's put them together 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:47.689
 we started here is worth these important 

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:51.769
 fingers 

00:06:47.689 --> 00:06:54.709
 they go together these first two and now 

00:06:51.769 --> 00:06:57.379
 they go four from the right for each sound 

00:06:54.709 --> 00:07:00.639
 on the left are white on the 

00:06:57.379 --> 00:07:00.639
 left on eighth notes on the right 

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.030
 Y 

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:18.530
 and ends together 

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:20.720
 there we have the subject with a little bit of 

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:22.610
 practice we practice the sentences a little 

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:25.130
 separately and then we put them all together 

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:28.310
 I say goodbye to you not before 

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:30.020
 interpret the entire piece until the 

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:32.030
 next 

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:34.630
 Let's go there 

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:34.630
 ah 

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:42.050
 do not 

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:48.890
 do not 

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:54.730
 ah
