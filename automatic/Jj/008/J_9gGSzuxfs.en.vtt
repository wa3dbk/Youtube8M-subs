00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
right we see what your helm amidships if

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.140 
right we see what your helm amidships if
you<00:02:20.530> can<00:02:20.739> put<00:02:20.950> your<00:02:21.010> helm<00:02:21.190> in<00:02:21.340> the<00:02:21.430> middle<00:02:21.700> yeah

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
you can put your helm in the middle yeah

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.130 
you can put your helm in the middle yeah
just<00:02:22.510> going<00:02:22.690> straight

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
just going straight

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.170 
just going straight
all<00:02:23.890> right<00:02:24.130> we're<00:02:24.280> going<00:02:24.459> pretty<00:02:24.790> straight

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
all right we're going pretty straight

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.750 
all right we're going pretty straight
now<00:02:25.420> I<00:02:25.450> seem<00:02:25.840> to<00:02:25.870> be<00:02:25.959> going<00:02:26.290> a<00:02:26.760> reasonable

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
now I seem to be going a reasonable

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.050 
now I seem to be going a reasonable
speed<00:02:27.940> with<00:02:28.360> cast<00:02:28.660> off<00:02:29.099> what<00:02:30.099> about<00:02:30.400> a<00:02:30.430> read<00:02:30.849> on

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
speed with cast off what about a read on

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.789 
speed with cast off what about a read on
this<00:02:31.209> some<00:02:31.540> the<00:02:31.780> swing<00:02:32.110> bridge<00:02:32.290> that<00:02:32.590> looks

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:32.799 
this some the swing bridge that looks

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:35.009 
this some the swing bridge that looks
tricky<00:02:33.069> the<00:02:33.670> swing<00:02:33.940> bridges<00:02:34.180> can<00:02:34.480> be<00:02:34.540> tricky

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
tricky the swing bridges can be tricky

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:36.839 
tricky the swing bridges can be tricky
but<00:02:35.140> it<00:02:35.290> should<00:02:35.470> be<00:02:35.620> no<00:02:35.769> concern<00:02:36.040> to<00:02:36.489> you<00:02:36.670> too

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
but it should be no concern to you too

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:38.220 
but it should be no concern to you too
much<00:02:37.090> because<00:02:37.329> a<00:02:37.510> cruiser<00:02:37.780> will<00:02:37.989> pass

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
much because a cruiser will pass

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.050 
much because a cruiser will pass
underneath<00:02:38.829> that<00:02:38.980> most<00:02:39.310> states<00:02:39.610> of<00:02:39.849> tide

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
underneath that most states of tide

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.789 
underneath that most states of tide
right<00:02:40.720> if<00:02:41.319> in<00:02:41.709> extreme<00:02:42.720> states<00:02:43.720> of<00:02:43.959> tide<00:02:44.170> it

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
right if in extreme states of tide it

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:48.930 
right if in extreme states of tide it
will<00:02:45.069> swing<00:02:45.549> if<00:02:46.329> the<00:02:46.660> red<00:02:46.930> flag<00:02:47.230> is<00:02:47.500> up<00:02:47.769> it<00:02:48.099> is

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
will swing if the red flag is up it is

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.819 
will swing if the red flag is up it is
operational<00:02:49.629> so<00:02:49.780> it<00:02:49.840> will<00:02:50.049> swing<00:02:50.379> on<00:02:50.500> demand

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:50.829 
operational so it will swing on demand

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:53.069 
operational so it will swing on demand
and<00:02:51.430> then<00:02:51.609> you<00:02:51.730> just<00:02:51.970> wait<00:02:52.120> then<00:02:52.720> you<00:02:52.750> would

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:53.079 
and then you just wait then you would

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:55.349 
and then you just wait then you would
wait<00:02:53.319> in<00:02:53.650> the<00:02:54.069> channel<00:02:54.459> until<00:02:54.910> it<00:02:55.000> is<00:02:55.120> swung

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:55.359 
wait in the channel until it is swung

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:57.990 
wait in the channel until it is swung
and<00:02:55.569> then<00:02:55.660> are<00:02:55.900> slow<00:02:56.290> well<00:02:56.769> if<00:02:57.010> I<00:02:57.160> see<00:02:57.579> engine

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
and then are slow well if I see engine

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.690 
and then are slow well if I see engine
suddenly<00:02:58.269> started<00:02:58.870> losing<00:02:59.350> power<00:02:59.519> then<00:03:00.519> G

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
suddenly started losing power then G

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.220 
suddenly started losing power then G
starts<00:03:01.090> to<00:03:01.209> lose<00:03:01.359> power<00:03:01.569> is<00:03:01.720> probably<00:03:01.900> a<00:03:02.079> good

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
starts to lose power is probably a good

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.009 
starts to lose power is probably a good
idea<00:03:02.290> to<00:03:02.620> take<00:03:02.980> it<00:03:03.010> out<00:03:03.250> gear<00:03:03.549> give<00:03:04.510> it<00:03:04.600> a<00:03:04.660> quick

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
idea to take it out gear give it a quick

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:07.530 
idea to take it out gear give it a quick
burst<00:03:05.470> or<00:03:05.799> to<00:03:06.069> a<00:03:06.100> stone<00:03:06.489> in<00:03:06.790> case<00:03:07.000> it's<00:03:07.209> a<00:03:07.329> rope

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
burst or to a stone in case it's a rope

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.539 
burst or to a stone in case it's a rope
around<00:03:07.690> the<00:03:07.930> propeller<00:03:08.139> Oh<00:03:08.650> something

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
around the propeller Oh something

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:11.490 
around the propeller Oh something
tangled<00:03:09.970> up<00:03:10.120> yeah<00:03:10.510> in<00:03:10.780> that<00:03:10.930> if<00:03:11.049> it's<00:03:11.260> anything

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
tangled up yeah in that if it's anything
