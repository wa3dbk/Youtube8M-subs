MIT<00:01:08.010> is<00:01:08.460> when<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.180> have<00:01:09.330> something

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
MIT is when you have something

physically and socially present people

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.359 
physically and socially present people
often<00:01:12.479> communicate<00:01:13.350> through<00:01:13.619> touch<00:01:13.830> right<00:01:14.250> so

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
often communicate through touch right so

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.859 
often communicate through touch right so
they<00:01:14.490> might<00:01:14.610> Pat<00:01:14.850> jebo<00:01:15.330> fit<00:01:15.509> does<00:01:15.630> something

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
they might Pat jebo fit does something

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.210 
they might Pat jebo fit does something
that<00:01:15.990> they<00:01:16.080> like<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.470> gebo<00:01:16.680> can<00:01:16.830> actually

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
that they like and gebo can actually

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.859 
that they like and gebo can actually
learn<00:01:17.700> from<00:01:17.939> that<00:01:18.090> well<00:01:18.360> I<00:01:18.420> want<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.659> do<00:01:18.750> more

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
learn from that well I want to do more

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.480 
learn from that well I want to do more
of<00:01:19.020> that<00:01:19.049> because<00:01:19.439> that<00:01:19.470> made<00:01:19.770> my<00:01:20.130> person

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
of that because that made my person

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.179 
of that because that made my person
happy<00:01:20.820> so<00:01:21.630> touch<00:01:22.049> can<00:01:22.320> become<00:01:22.590> an<00:01:22.740> important

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
happy so touch can become an important

communication and kind of reward signal

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.330 
communication and kind of reward signal
to<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.090> robot<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.650> Brazil<00:01:28.650> says<00:01:29.009> that<00:01:29.189> over

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
to the robot and Brazil says that over

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.880 
to the robot and Brazil says that over
time<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:30.270> robot<00:01:30.630> will<00:01:30.659> get<00:01:30.960> smarter<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.710> have

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
time the robot will get smarter and have

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.069 
time the robot will get smarter and have
increased<00:01:32.369> functionality<00:01:32.840> thanks<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:33.960> its
