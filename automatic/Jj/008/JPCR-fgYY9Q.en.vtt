I<00:01:12.540> knew<00:01:12.689> what<00:01:12.720> I<00:01:12.840> wanted<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.320> make<00:01:13.560> I<00:01:13.770> needed<00:01:14.130> to

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
I knew what I wanted to make I needed to

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.550 
I knew what I wanted to make I needed to
decide<00:01:14.580> on<00:01:14.820> some<00:01:15.000> 3d<00:01:15.360> modeling<00:01:15.930> software<00:01:16.140> to

use<00:01:16.770> there<00:01:17.369> are<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:17.549> ton<00:01:17.909> of<00:01:17.939> options<00:01:18.509> but<00:01:18.659> I

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
use there are a ton of options but I

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.109 
use there are a ton of options but I
ended<00:01:19.110> up<00:01:19.290> using<00:01:19.500> Google<00:01:19.979> Sketchup<00:01:20.340> which<00:01:20.970> is

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
ended up using Google Sketchup which is

ended up using Google Sketchup which is
easy<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.630> learn<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:21.840> use<00:01:22.170> for<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.009> really

powerful 3d program I would recommend

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
even build your own 3d printer but

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.249 
even build your own 3d printer but
because<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.000> technology<00:01:36.600> is<00:01:36.630> still<00:01:36.869> pretty
