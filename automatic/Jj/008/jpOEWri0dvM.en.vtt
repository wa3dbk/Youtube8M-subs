hello this is a review of the coast HB
266<00:00:03.659> lumen<00:00:04.110> flashlight<00:00:04.940> now<00:00:05.940> it<00:00:06.180> comes<00:00:06.359> in<00:00:06.509> a

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
266 lumen flashlight now it comes in a

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.750 
266 lumen flashlight now it comes in a
little<00:00:06.660> box<00:00:06.930> that<00:00:07.140> you<00:00:07.290> see<00:00:07.379> here<00:00:07.799> it<00:00:08.370> comes

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
little box that you see here it comes

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.150 
little box that you see here it comes
with<00:00:09.150> battery<00:00:09.840> included<00:00:10.320> takes<00:00:10.590> a<00:00:10.740> triple-a

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
with battery included takes a triple-a

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.060 
with battery included takes a triple-a
battery<00:00:11.639> and<00:00:11.880> it<00:00:12.450> is<00:00:12.599> surprisingly<00:00:13.349> small<00:00:13.769> and

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
battery and it is surprisingly small and

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.589 
battery and it is surprisingly small and
it's<00:00:14.160> very<00:00:14.429> surprisingly<00:00:15.030> bright<00:00:15.299> which<00:00:15.480> I'll

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
it's very surprisingly bright which I'll

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:16.340 
it's very surprisingly bright which I'll
show<00:00:15.780> you<00:00:15.839> in<00:00:16.020> a<00:00:16.080> minute

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
show you in a minute

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.170 
show you in a minute
it<00:00:16.859> comes<00:00:17.100> with<00:00:17.220> instructions<00:00:17.369> but<00:00:18.060> it's

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
it comes with instructions but it's

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.400 
it comes with instructions but it's
really<00:00:18.300> self<00:00:18.600> explanatory<00:00:18.660> you're<00:00:19.289> not

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
really self explanatory you're not

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.840 
really self explanatory you're not
Canadian<00:00:19.770> instructions<00:00:20.310> and<00:00:20.580> a<00:00:20.640> little

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
Canadian instructions and a little

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.370 
Canadian instructions and a little
advertisement<00:00:21.330> guide<00:00:21.660> that<00:00:21.900> it<00:00:21.990> comes<00:00:22.170> with

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
advertisement guide that it comes with

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.769 
advertisement guide that it comes with
but<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.070> thing<00:00:23.369> is<00:00:23.400> small<00:00:23.730> for<00:00:23.789> example<00:00:24.119> get<00:00:24.750> a

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
but the thing is small for example get a

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.990 
but the thing is small for example get a
sense<00:00:25.080> of<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.320> size<00:00:25.529> of<00:00:25.830> what<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.519> size<00:00:26.730> is

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
sense of the size of what the size is

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.269 
sense of the size of what the size is
compared<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:27.680> different<00:00:28.680> objects<00:00:28.980> around<00:00:29.130> it

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
compared to different objects around it

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.420 
compared to different objects around it
it's<00:00:29.460> pretty<00:00:29.939> small<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.980> you<00:00:31.980> can<00:00:32.160> pull<00:00:32.309> it

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
it's pretty small and you can pull it

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.370 
it's pretty small and you can pull it
out<00:00:32.520> and<00:00:32.759> you<00:00:32.910> do<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.239> zooming<00:00:33.660> by<00:00:34.140> just

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
out and you do the zooming by just

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.990 
out and you do the zooming by just
twisting<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.950> head<00:00:35.100> of<00:00:35.250> here<00:00:35.460> so<00:00:35.790> you<00:00:35.850> can

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
twisting the head of here so you can

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.030 
twisting the head of here so you can
twist<00:00:36.239> it<00:00:36.420> this<00:00:36.989> way<00:00:37.230> in<00:00:37.410> that<00:00:37.530> way<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:37.980> this

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
twist it this way in that way and this

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.160 
twist it this way in that way and this
is<00:00:38.100> how<00:00:38.340> you<00:00:38.399> get<00:00:38.610> from<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:39.090> focused<00:00:39.690> beam<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:40.140> a

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
is how you get from a focused beam to a

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.150 
is how you get from a focused beam to a
wide-angle<00:00:40.800> floodlight<00:00:42.050> now<00:00:43.050> size-wise<00:00:43.770> it

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
wide-angle floodlight now size-wise it

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.600 
wide-angle floodlight now size-wise it
is<00:00:44.399> surprisingly<00:00:45.329> small<00:00:45.980> for<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.250> amount<00:00:47.520> of

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
is surprisingly small for the amount of

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.490 
is surprisingly small for the amount of
power<00:00:47.879> that<00:00:48.149> it<00:00:48.300> compares<00:00:48.719> that<00:00:48.840> beats<00:00:49.289> out

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
power that it compares that beats out

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.650 
power that it compares that beats out
most<00:00:49.920> of<00:00:50.070> my<00:00:50.190> flashlights<00:00:50.820> but<00:00:51.059> perhaps<00:00:51.239> not

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
most of my flashlights but perhaps not

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.869 
most of my flashlights but perhaps not
the<00:00:51.899> absolute<00:00:52.440> largest<00:00:52.739> one<00:00:53.160> with<00:00:53.309> this<00:00:53.460> huge

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
the absolute largest one with this huge

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.450 
the absolute largest one with this huge
battery<00:00:54.239> on<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:54.530> but<00:00:55.530> compared<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.010> all<00:00:56.190> of<00:00:56.219> the

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
battery on it but compared to all of the

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.459 
battery on it but compared to all of the
rest<00:00:56.640> of<00:00:56.760> mine<00:00:56.879> this<00:00:57.059> thing<00:00:57.239> is<00:00:57.510> surprisingly

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
rest of mine this thing is surprisingly

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.819 
rest of mine this thing is surprisingly
bright<00:00:58.829> compared<00:00:59.789> to<00:01:00.030> even<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.140> next<00:01:01.469> one<00:01:01.620> so

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
bright compared to even the next one so

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.290 
bright compared to even the next one so
to<00:01:01.890> be<00:01:02.039> fair<00:01:02.070> you<00:01:02.550> know<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:02.699> compare<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.270> to

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
to be fair you know you compare it to

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.840 
to be fair you know you compare it to
the<00:01:03.449> old<00:01:03.480> style<00:01:04.110> for<00:01:04.799> its<00:01:04.890> size<00:01:05.159> right<00:01:05.549> if<00:01:05.729> this

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
the old style for its size right if this

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.230 
the old style for its size right if this
thing<00:01:06.060> is<00:01:06.210> puny<00:01:07.130> which<00:01:08.130> is<00:01:08.310> significantly

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
thing is puny which is significantly

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.710 
thing is puny which is significantly
more<00:01:09.330> powerful<00:01:09.869> than<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:11.729> old<00:01:11.880> style<00:01:12.090> here

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
more powerful than the old style here

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.289 
more powerful than the old style here
but<00:01:13.619> maybe<00:01:13.830> more<00:01:14.100> realistic<00:01:14.760> is<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:15.030> compare

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
but maybe more realistic is to compare

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.320 
but maybe more realistic is to compare
it<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.540> LED<00:01:16.020> one<00:01:16.229> so<00:01:16.439> this<00:01:16.590> was<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:17.100> 6<00:01:18.090> LED

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
it to a LED one so this was a 6 LED

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.580 
it to a LED one so this was a 6 LED
light<00:01:18.630> that<00:01:18.780> I<00:01:18.869> had<00:01:19.020> here<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.439> it's

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
light that I had here and it's

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.730 
light that I had here and it's
surprisingly<00:01:20.369> more<00:01:20.729> powerful<00:01:21.450> but<00:01:22.020> so<00:01:22.530> much

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
surprisingly more powerful but so much

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:23.330 
surprisingly more powerful but so much
smaller

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
smaller

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.190 
smaller
you<00:01:24.060> know<00:01:24.150> I<00:01:24.180> compared<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.720> size<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.110> I'll

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
you know I compared the size and I'll

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.510 
you know I compared the size and I'll
show<00:01:25.350> you<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.500> little<00:01:25.590> bit<00:01:25.740> later<00:01:26.070> with<00:01:26.340> this

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
show you a little bit later with this

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.950 
show you a little bit later with this
with<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.909> lights<00:01:27.090> turned<00:01:27.299> off<00:01:27.540> but<00:01:27.780> this

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
with the lights turned off but this

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.520 
with the lights turned off but this
one's<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.229> much<00:01:28.560> wider<00:01:28.860> flood<00:01:30.170> so<00:01:31.170> that's

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
one's a much wider flood so that's

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.469 
one's a much wider flood so that's
particularly<00:01:32.250> nice<00:01:32.579> even<00:01:32.850> compared<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.329> these

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
particularly nice even compared to these

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.380 
particularly nice even compared to these
ones<00:01:33.720> so<00:01:33.960> it's<00:01:34.950> extra<00:01:35.670> compact<00:01:36.180> and

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
ones so it's extra compact and

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.289 
ones so it's extra compact and
surprisingly<00:01:37.229> bright<00:01:37.850> surprisingly<00:01:38.850> bright

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
surprisingly bright surprisingly bright

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.780 
surprisingly bright surprisingly bright
but<00:01:40.290> it<00:01:40.409> feels<00:01:40.650> really<00:01:40.860> good<00:01:41.100> in<00:01:41.220> your<00:01:41.310> hands

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
but it feels really good in your hands

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.109 
but it feels really good in your hands
it<00:01:42.479> isn't<00:01:43.229> so<00:01:43.439> heavy<00:01:43.710> that<00:01:44.579> when<00:01:44.820> you<00:01:44.909> compare

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
it isn't so heavy that when you compare

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.740 
it isn't so heavy that when you compare
it<00:01:45.420> on<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.659> scale<00:01:46.049> for<00:01:46.350> example<00:01:46.409> it<00:01:47.220> only<00:01:47.430> weighs

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
it on a scale for example it only weighs

1 point 3 ounces and my scale is an
example<00:01:51.540> here<00:01:51.840> but<00:01:52.170> it<00:01:52.259> has<00:01:52.740> some<00:01:52.920> heft<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:53.280> it

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
example here but it has some heft to it

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.789 
example here but it has some heft to it
it<00:01:53.700> seems<00:01:54.240> very<00:01:54.659> well-constructed

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
it seems very well-constructed

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.249 
it seems very well-constructed
it<00:01:56.189> feels<00:01:56.520> really<00:01:56.729> good<00:01:56.969> very<00:01:57.509> solidly<00:01:57.990> built

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
it feels really good very solidly built

it feels really good very solidly built
when<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:58.680> take<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.310> battery<00:01:59.610> out<00:01:59.700> by

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
when you take the battery out by

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.969 
when you take the battery out by
unscrewing<00:02:00.420> on<00:02:00.600> this<00:02:00.750> end<00:02:01.020> it<00:02:01.200> has<00:02:01.649> a<00:02:01.680> nice

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
unscrewing on this end it has a nice

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.429 
unscrewing on this end it has a nice
little<00:02:02.130> clicker<00:02:02.520> at<00:02:02.880> this<00:02:03.090> end<00:02:03.299> here<00:02:03.570> this<00:02:04.350> is

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
little clicker at this end here this is

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:05.690 
little clicker at this end here this is
a<00:02:04.469> little<00:02:04.680> rubber<00:02:04.890> thing<00:02:05.189> that<00:02:05.310> you<00:02:05.399> can<00:02:05.490> click

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
a little rubber thing that you can click

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.109 
a little rubber thing that you can click
to<00:02:05.909> turn<00:02:06.060> on<00:02:06.270> turn<00:02:06.689> off<00:02:06.899> I<00:02:07.770> like<00:02:08.369> that<00:02:08.729> it<00:02:08.849> comes

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
to turn on turn off I like that it comes

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.300 
to turn on turn off I like that it comes
with<00:02:09.270> a<00:02:09.300> little<00:02:09.509> belt<00:02:09.840> clip<00:02:10.170> so<00:02:10.739> or<00:02:10.890> pocket

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
with a little belt clip so or pocket

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.200 
with a little belt clip so or pocket
clip<00:02:11.459> whatever<00:02:11.790> you<00:02:11.910> want<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.150> do<00:02:12.270> with<00:02:12.450> it

clip whatever you want to do with it

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:14.880 
clip whatever you want to do with it
as<00:02:13.330> opposed<00:02:13.660> to<00:02:13.780> the<00:02:13.930> pen<00:02:14.170> model<00:02:14.560> which<00:02:14.740> was

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
as opposed to the pen model which was

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.420 
as opposed to the pen model which was
another<00:02:15.220> example<00:02:15.630> that<00:02:16.630> they<00:02:16.750> had<00:02:16.990> I<00:02:17.430> really

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
another example that they had I really

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.190 
another example that they had I really
liked<00:02:18.700> that<00:02:18.880> I<00:02:19.090> can<00:02:19.360> just<00:02:19.540> clip<00:02:19.750> this<00:02:19.870> in<00:02:20.050> here

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
liked that I can just clip this in here

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.110 
liked that I can just clip this in here
so<00:02:20.320> here's<00:02:20.650> the<00:02:20.830> deal<00:02:20.980> is<00:02:21.250> yes<00:02:21.850> you<00:02:22.000> could

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
so here's the deal is yes you could

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.060 
so here's the deal is yes you could
always<00:02:22.240> have<00:02:22.360> some<00:02:22.990> gigantic<00:02:23.470> large

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
always have some gigantic large

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.290 
always have some gigantic large
flashlight<00:02:24.700> from<00:02:24.850> when<00:02:24.970> you're<00:02:25.060> really

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
flashlight from when you're really

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.940 
flashlight from when you're really
searching<00:02:25.510> around<00:02:25.960> because<00:02:26.530> honestly<00:02:26.830> this

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
searching around because honestly this

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.030 
searching around because honestly this
is<00:02:27.130> 66<00:02:27.730> lumens<00:02:28.120> but<00:02:28.350> compared<00:02:29.350> to<00:02:29.410> carrying

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
is 66 lumens but compared to carrying

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.800 
is 66 lumens but compared to carrying
around<00:02:30.100> something<00:02:30.790> in<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.120> old<00:02:31.240> school<00:02:31.540> style

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
around something in the old school style

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.440 
around something in the old school style
like<00:02:32.140> this<00:02:32.350> of<00:02:32.620> course<00:02:32.650> which<00:02:33.550> is<00:02:33.580> very<00:02:33.790> meek

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
like this of course which is very meek

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.750 
like this of course which is very meek
in<00:02:34.600> comparison<00:02:35.110> to<00:02:35.200> modern<00:02:35.380> LEDs<00:02:35.800> but<00:02:36.580> this

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
in comparison to modern LEDs but this

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.090 
in comparison to modern LEDs but this
thing<00:02:37.030> here<00:02:37.270> is<00:02:37.450> really<00:02:38.080> compact<00:02:38.770> you<00:02:38.950> can

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
thing here is really compact you can

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.530 
thing here is really compact you can
throw<00:02:39.310> this<00:02:39.460> in<00:02:39.610> a<00:02:39.670> purse<00:02:39.910> throw<00:02:40.270> in<00:02:40.420> your

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
throw this in a purse throw in your

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.600 
throw this in a purse throw in your
pocket<00:02:41.020> backpack<00:02:41.590> bag<00:02:41.950> and<00:02:42.220> something<00:02:42.520> you

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
pocket backpack bag and something you

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.450 
pocket backpack bag and something you
barely<00:02:42.820> have<00:02:43.120> to<00:02:43.150> think<00:02:43.420> about<00:02:43.540> the<00:02:44.140> only

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
barely have to think about the only

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.070 
barely have to think about the only
drawback<00:02:45.460> to<00:02:45.640> the<00:02:45.730> entire<00:02:46.030> thing<00:02:46.480> is<00:02:46.690> the

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
drawback to the entire thing is the

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.530 
drawback to the entire thing is the
battery<00:02:47.440> life<00:02:47.710> is<00:02:48.280> only<00:02:49.530> something<00:02:50.530> like<00:02:51.540> 2.5

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
battery life is only something like 2.5

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.720 
battery life is only something like 2.5
hours<00:02:52.750> so<00:02:53.530> it's<00:02:53.830> a<00:02:53.920> two<00:02:54.100> point<00:02:54.280> five<00:02:54.520> hour

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
hours so it's a two point five hour

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.480 
hours so it's a two point five hour
battery<00:02:55.270> life<00:02:55.300> to<00:02:55.750> get<00:02:55.990> a<00:02:56.170> ton<00:02:56.680> of<00:02:56.710> light<00:02:57.250> out

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.490 
battery life to get a ton of light out

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.910 
battery life to get a ton of light out
of<00:02:57.640> this<00:02:57.820> thing<00:02:58.060> relative<00:02:58.720> to<00:02:59.440> you<00:02:59.800> know

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
of this thing relative to you know

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.040 
of this thing relative to you know
here's<00:03:00.160> another<00:03:00.370> crank<00:03:01.090> version<00:03:01.570> LED<00:03:01.780> light

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
here's another crank version LED light

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.100 
here's another crank version LED light
which<00:03:02.290> is<00:03:02.440> just<00:03:02.680> anemic<00:03:03.220> in<00:03:03.340> comparison<00:03:04.110> that

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
which is just anemic in comparison that

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.970 
which is just anemic in comparison that
had<00:03:05.260> a<00:03:05.290> crank<00:03:05.620> on<00:03:05.800> it<00:03:06.000> but<00:03:07.000> you<00:03:07.900> get<00:03:08.050> even<00:03:08.320> you

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
had a crank on it but you get even you

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.260 
had a crank on it but you get even you
know<00:03:09.100> here's<00:03:09.340> a<00:03:09.400> different<00:03:09.760> style<00:03:09.910> here<00:03:10.150> it's

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.270 
know here's a different style here it's

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.870 
know here's a different style here it's
brighter<00:03:10.570> and<00:03:10.780> intensity<00:03:11.580> but<00:03:12.580> it's

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
brighter and intensity but it's

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.540 
brighter and intensity but it's
surprising<00:03:13.690> that<00:03:14.050> how<00:03:14.350> bright<00:03:14.950> this<00:03:15.190> little

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
surprising that how bright this little

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.600 
surprising that how bright this little
guy<00:03:15.700> is<00:03:15.870> so<00:03:16.870> let's<00:03:17.830> be<00:03:18.100> real

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
guy is so let's be real

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.340 
guy is so let's be real
first<00:03:19.150> of<00:03:19.300> all<00:03:19.360> in<00:03:19.480> comparison<00:03:19.930> like<00:03:20.050> you<00:03:20.200> can

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
first of all in comparison like you can

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:21.990 
first of all in comparison like you can
even<00:03:20.440> see<00:03:20.710> the<00:03:20.860> size<00:03:21.070> compared<00:03:21.550> to<00:03:21.610> pens<00:03:21.850> and

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
even see the size compared to pens and

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.720 
even see the size compared to pens and
pencils<00:03:22.150> but<00:03:22.870> let's<00:03:23.020> be<00:03:23.170> realistic<00:03:23.470> it<00:03:23.830> is<00:03:23.860> 66

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
pencils but let's be realistic it is 66

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.160 
pencils but let's be realistic it is 66
lumens<00:03:25.240> so<00:03:25.360> let's<00:03:25.630> remind<00:03:25.960> ourselves

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
lumens so let's remind ourselves

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.070 
lumens so let's remind ourselves
compared<00:03:26.830> to<00:03:26.950> an<00:03:27.070> average<00:03:27.370> light<00:03:28.060> bulb<00:03:28.360> which

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
compared to an average light bulb which

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.440 
compared to an average light bulb which
a<00:03:29.260> light<00:03:29.500> bulb<00:03:29.770> you<00:03:30.070> know<00:03:30.310> here's<00:03:30.520> your<00:03:30.640> 57

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
a light bulb you know here's your 57

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.560 
a light bulb you know here's your 57
watt<00:03:31.600> light<00:03:31.810> bulb<00:03:32.050> that<00:03:32.140> outputs<00:03:33.060> almost<00:03:34.060> 800

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.380 
watt light bulb that outputs almost 800
lumens<00:03:34.690> so<00:03:34.990> this<00:03:35.200> is<00:03:35.320> 66<00:03:36.070> lumens<00:03:36.490> the<00:03:37.150> light

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
lumens so this is 66 lumens the light

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.660 
lumens so this is 66 lumens the light
bulb<00:03:37.630> is<00:03:37.810> 780<00:03:38.470> lumens<00:03:38.890> so<00:03:38.920> don't<00:03:39.190> think<00:03:39.520> that

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
bulb is 780 lumens so don't think that

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.580 
bulb is 780 lumens so don't think that
it's<00:03:39.820> going<00:03:39.970> to<00:03:40.090> light<00:03:40.420> up<00:03:40.540> a<00:03:40.630> light<00:03:40.810> room<00:03:41.440> as

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
it's going to light up a light room as

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.430 
it's going to light up a light room as
much<00:03:41.800> as<00:03:41.950> a<00:03:41.980> 60<00:03:42.430> watt<00:03:42.520> light<00:03:42.760> bulb<00:03:43.000> would<00:03:43.150> do

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
much as a 60 watt light bulb would do

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.190 
much as a 60 watt light bulb would do
but<00:03:44.440> for<00:03:45.430> what<00:03:45.610> it<00:03:45.730> doesn't<00:03:46.300> and<00:03:46.660> being<00:03:47.080> able

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
but for what it doesn't and being able

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.040 
but for what it doesn't and being able
to<00:03:47.400> find<00:03:48.400> your<00:03:48.550> way<00:03:48.640> around<00:03:48.780> being<00:03:49.780> able<00:03:49.870> to

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050 
to find your way around being able to

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:51.600 
to find your way around being able to
screw<00:03:50.380> with<00:03:50.530> this<00:03:50.650> head<00:03:50.860> down<00:03:51.040> you<00:03:51.250> can<00:03:51.370> make<00:03:51.550> a

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
screw with this head down you can make a

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.110 
screw with this head down you can make a
pinpoint<00:03:52.300> in<00:03:52.980> large<00:03:53.980> intensity<00:03:54.550> area<00:03:54.850> or

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
pinpoint in large intensity area or

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.630 
pinpoint in large intensity area or
widen<00:03:55.810> out<00:03:55.930> for<00:03:56.140> a<00:03:56.170> flood<00:03:56.500> and<00:03:56.800> it<00:03:57.460> is

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
widen out for a flood and it is

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.030 
widen out for a flood and it is
remarkably<00:03:58.570> nice<00:03:58.870> in<00:03:59.110> that<00:03:59.230> perspective<00:03:59.500> I

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
remarkably nice in that perspective I

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.850 
remarkably nice in that perspective I
was<00:04:00.640> so<00:04:01.060> impressed<00:04:01.660> by<00:04:01.930> this<00:04:02.170> little<00:04:02.680> guy<00:04:02.830> that

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
this one it seems so nice that I thought

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.850 
this one it seems so nice that I thought
it<00:04:27.950> would<00:04:28.040> be<00:04:28.160> excellent<00:04:28.580> so<00:04:29.650> let's<00:04:30.650> take<00:04:30.830> a

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
it would be excellent so let's take a

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.680 
it would be excellent so let's take a
quick<00:04:31.100> look<00:04:31.340> with<00:04:31.550> the<00:04:31.700> lights<00:04:31.880> turned<00:04:32.090> off<00:04:32.360> to

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
quick look with the lights turned off to

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:33.970 
quick look with the lights turned off to
see<00:04:32.810> the<00:04:32.930> comparison<00:04:33.440> of<00:04:33.560> some<00:04:33.680> different

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980 
see the comparison of some different

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.650 
see the comparison of some different
flashlights<00:04:34.430> okay<00:04:35.030> now<00:04:35.180> let's<00:04:35.360> do<00:04:35.450> some

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
flashlights okay now let's do some

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.750 
flashlights okay now let's do some
comparisons<00:04:36.260> in<00:04:36.380> the<00:04:36.470> dark<00:04:36.680> very<00:04:36.919> dim<00:04:37.220> so<00:04:37.520> the

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
comparisons in the dark very dim so the

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.310 
comparisons in the dark very dim so the
cameras<00:04:38.030> gonna<00:04:38.150> probably<00:04:38.480> over<00:04:38.720> adjust<00:04:39.110> for

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
cameras gonna probably over adjust for

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.280 
cameras gonna probably over adjust for
dark<00:04:39.860> mode<00:04:40.160> but<00:04:40.370> here's<00:04:40.520> a<00:04:40.580> simple<00:04:41.300> here's<00:04:42.169> the

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.290 
dark mode but here's a simple here's the

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:44.080 
dark mode but here's a simple here's the
anemic<00:04:42.740> one<00:04:42.950> that<00:04:43.160> even<00:04:43.310> in<00:04:43.490> pitch<00:04:43.760> dark

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
anemic one that even in pitch dark

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.140 
anemic one that even in pitch dark
things<00:04:44.360> look<00:04:44.570> pretty<00:04:44.720> bright<00:04:45.250> but<00:04:46.250> that's

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
things look pretty bright but that's

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.170 
things look pretty bright but that's
there<00:04:47.450> than<00:04:47.870> your<00:04:48.080> usual<00:04:48.260> old<00:04:48.820> cylinder<00:04:49.820> style

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
there than your usual old cylinder style

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.960 
there than your usual old cylinder style
light<00:04:51.169> which<00:04:51.680> is<00:04:51.830> really<00:04:52.100> anemic<00:04:52.580> in<00:04:52.790> real

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
light which is really anemic in real

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:54.640 
light which is really anemic in real
life<00:04:53.180> right<00:04:53.419> it's<00:04:53.630> real<00:04:53.810> haunted<00:04:54.169> house<00:04:54.320> vibe

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
life right it's real haunted house vibe

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.159 
life right it's real haunted house vibe
going<00:04:55.070> on<00:04:55.190> here<00:04:55.490> a<00:04:55.700> much<00:04:56.450> better<00:04:56.660> comparison

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:57.169 
going on here a much better comparison

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:00.159 
going on here a much better comparison
is<00:04:57.650> going<00:04:57.950> to<00:04:58.070> be<00:04:58.160> the<00:04:58.430> six<00:04:59.390> LED<00:04:59.630> light<00:04:59.930> that<00:05:00.110> I

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:00.169 
is going to be the six LED light that I

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:01.870 
is going to be the six LED light that I
have<00:05:00.320> hid<00:05:00.470> here<00:05:00.650> and<00:05:00.830> we<00:05:00.980> see<00:05:01.190> the<00:05:01.370> focus

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
have hid here and we see the focus

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.050 
have hid here and we see the focus
adjusts<00:05:02.390> so<00:05:03.250> the<00:05:04.250> low<00:05:04.400> light<00:05:04.640> mode<00:05:04.669> of<00:05:05.000> the

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
adjusts so the low light mode of the

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:06.159 
adjusts so the low light mode of the
camera<00:05:05.270> is<00:05:05.419> going<00:05:05.510> to<00:05:05.570> definitely<00:05:05.750> pick<00:05:06.080> up

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:06.169 
camera is going to definitely pick up

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:08.140 
camera is going to definitely pick up
more<00:05:06.380> things<00:05:06.680> but<00:05:07.370> this<00:05:07.520> is<00:05:07.669> the<00:05:07.790> closest

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
more things but this is the closest

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.300 
more things but this is the closest
comparison<00:05:08.300> that<00:05:09.260> I<00:05:09.380> had<00:05:09.560> was<00:05:09.740> the<00:05:09.770> six<00:05:10.100> light

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310 
comparison that I had was the six light

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.740 
comparison that I had was the six light
camera<00:05:10.700> but<00:05:10.910> now<00:05:11.030> let's<00:05:11.210> turn<00:05:11.390> that<00:05:11.540> off<00:05:11.720> and

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
camera but now let's turn that off and

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.190 
camera but now let's turn that off and
turn<00:05:12.110> on<00:05:12.140> this<00:05:12.650> little<00:05:13.520> HP<00:05:13.820> to<00:05:14.180> light<00:05:14.390> so<00:05:14.990> look

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:15.200 
turn on this little HP to light so look

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.140 
turn on this little HP to light so look
at<00:05:15.320> the<00:05:15.410> nice<00:05:15.590> wide<00:05:15.919> flood<00:05:16.430> that<00:05:16.610> we<00:05:16.730> get<00:05:16.910> here

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.150 
at the nice wide flood that we get here

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:34.940 
trying to work on that's obviously a

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.510 
trying to work on that's obviously a
reason<00:05:35.360> why<00:05:36.169> you<00:05:36.229> might<00:05:36.440> do<00:05:36.650> that<00:05:36.830> so<00:05:37.310> but<00:05:37.460> if

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 
reason why you might do that so but if

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:38.590 
reason why you might do that so but if
you're<00:05:37.640> gonna<00:05:37.790> really<00:05:37.940> hunting<00:05:38.270> around<00:05:38.360> in

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:38.600 
you're gonna really hunting around in

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.690 
you're gonna really hunting around in
the<00:05:38.690> dark<00:05:38.900> walking<00:05:39.530> around<00:05:39.710> in<00:05:39.800> the<00:05:39.860> woods<00:05:39.979> or

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:45.410 
you dropped something under the seat on

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:47.590 
you dropped something under the seat on
a<00:05:45.440> nighttime<00:05:45.710> flight<00:05:46.220> I<00:05:46.460> know<00:05:46.940> I<00:05:47.030> have<00:05:47.360> that<00:05:47.539> I

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:47.600 
a nighttime flight I know I have that I

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.240 
a nighttime flight I know I have that I
realize<00:05:47.990> that<00:05:48.020> I<00:05:48.229> will<00:05:48.380> not<00:05:48.710> go<00:05:48.860> on<00:05:48.950> the<00:05:49.070> plane

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250 
realize that I will not go on the plane

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.370 
realize that I will not go on the plane
without<00:05:49.400> this<00:05:49.729> again<00:05:50.660> cuz<00:05:50.870> it<00:05:50.990> really<00:05:51.020> helps

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:51.380 
without this again cuz it really helps

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:53.260 
without this again cuz it really helps
you<00:05:51.470> find<00:05:51.650> those<00:05:51.830> things<00:05:52.070> oh<00:05:52.340> no<00:05:53.060> no<00:05:53.150> that's

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:53.270 
you find those things oh no no that's

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:54.850 
you find those things oh no no that's
compared<00:05:53.720> to<00:05:53.810> the<00:05:53.900> big<00:05:54.080> guy<00:05:54.229> that<00:05:54.260> I<00:05:54.470> got<00:05:54.530> here

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:54.860 
compared to the big guy that I got here

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.050 
compared to the big guy that I got here
too<00:05:55.010> just<00:05:55.310> to<00:05:55.370> give<00:05:55.550> you<00:05:55.640> an<00:05:55.729> example

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.060 
too just to give you an example

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.050 
too just to give you an example
difference<00:05:57.010> again<00:05:58.010> just<00:05:58.220> think<00:05:58.460> is<00:05:58.669> that's

00:05:59.050 --> 00:05:59.060 
difference again just think is that's

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.390 
difference again just think is that's
gonna<00:05:59.380> adjust<00:06:00.380> for<00:06:00.620> the<00:06:00.680> light<00:06:00.890> differently

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:01.400 
gonna adjust for the light differently

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.980 
gonna adjust for the light differently
because<00:06:01.729> of<00:06:01.880> the<00:06:02.090> video<00:06:02.300> camera<00:06:02.630> is<00:06:02.690> trying<00:06:02.900> to

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:02.990 
because of the video camera is trying to

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.610 
because of the video camera is trying to
be<00:06:03.080> smart<00:06:03.410> in<00:06:03.530> low-light<00:06:03.950> but<00:06:04.789> this<00:06:04.940> thing<00:06:05.240> is

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:05.620 
be smart in low-light but this thing is

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:08.710 
be smart in low-light but this thing is
oddly<00:06:06.620> not<00:06:07.130> a<00:06:07.430> whole<00:06:07.729> lot<00:06:07.910> brighter<00:06:08.240> it<00:06:08.479> casts

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:08.720 
oddly not a whole lot brighter it casts

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.190 
oddly not a whole lot brighter it casts
a<00:06:08.930> wider<00:06:09.669> beam<00:06:10.669> with<00:06:11.030> a<00:06:11.060> bright<00:06:11.419> Center<00:06:11.960> so<00:06:12.110> you

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:12.200 
a wider beam with a bright Center so you

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.900 
a wider beam with a bright Center so you
kind<00:06:12.440> of<00:06:12.530> get<00:06:12.620> a<00:06:12.650> flood<00:06:12.979> plus<00:06:13.250> a<00:06:13.280> center<00:06:13.729> which

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:13.910 
kind of get a flood plus a center which

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:16.659 
kind of get a flood plus a center which
is<00:06:14.090> to<00:06:14.570> be<00:06:14.720> fair<00:06:15.039> something<00:06:16.039> different<00:06:16.490> so

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:16.669 
is to be fair something different so

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:17.890 
is to be fair something different so
this<00:06:16.820> thing<00:06:17.000> probably<00:06:17.330> would<00:06:17.450> do<00:06:17.539> different

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:17.900 
this thing probably would do different

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.590 
this thing probably would do different
if<00:06:17.960> it<00:06:18.080> were<00:06:18.169> wider<00:06:18.470> but<00:06:19.430> we<00:06:19.700> had<00:06:19.910> that<00:06:20.150> and<00:06:20.450> of

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:20.600 
if it were wider but we had that and of

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.420 
if it were wider but we had that and of
course<00:06:20.630> you<00:06:21.140> have<00:06:21.289> this<00:06:21.530> gives<00:06:21.860> you<00:06:21.950> about<00:06:22.160> the

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:22.430 
course you have this gives you about the

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:25.210 
course you have this gives you about the
difference<00:06:22.820> it's<00:06:23.780> a<00:06:24.050> you<00:06:24.590> know<00:06:24.680> compared<00:06:25.160> to

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:25.220 
difference it's a you know compared to

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:28.060 
difference it's a you know compared to
an<00:06:25.340> old<00:06:25.490> incandescent<00:06:25.910> bulb<00:06:26.510> of<00:06:26.750> course<00:06:27.070> of

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:28.070 
an old incandescent bulb of course of

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:29.320 
an old incandescent bulb of course of
the<00:06:28.220> older<00:06:28.460> flashlights<00:06:28.970> you're<00:06:29.150> going<00:06:29.270> to

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:29.330 
the older flashlights you're going to

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.630 
the older flashlights you're going to
get<00:06:29.419> a<00:06:29.450> much<00:06:29.660> warmer<00:06:29.960> feel<00:06:30.500> so<00:06:31.130> you're<00:06:31.370> going

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:31.640 
get a much warmer feel so you're going

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:34.230 
get a much warmer feel so you're going
to<00:06:31.760> get<00:06:31.910> a<00:06:32.090> colder<00:06:32.479> feel<00:06:32.750> out<00:06:32.990> of<00:06:33.320> LED<00:06:33.860> lights

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:34.240 
to get a colder feel out of LED lights

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.120 
to get a colder feel out of LED lights

it's just that one that was three times

00:06:59.409 --> 00:06:59.419 
was so confident in this one I really

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:01.210 
was so confident in this one I really
can't<00:06:59.930> sing<00:07:00.199> it<00:07:00.289> a<00:07:00.349> whole<00:07:00.500> lot<00:07:00.530> more<00:07:00.650> praises

the<00:07:01.370> only<00:07:01.970> negative<00:07:02.449> to<00:07:02.630> this<00:07:02.780> entire<00:07:03.139> thing

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:03.560 
the only negative to this entire thing

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.909 
the only negative to this entire thing
is<00:07:03.770> the<00:07:03.800> battery<00:07:04.069> life<00:07:04.610> is<00:07:04.849> only<00:07:05.710> 2.5<00:07:06.710> hours

00:07:06.909 --> 00:07:06.919 
is the battery life is only 2.5 hours

00:07:06.919 --> 00:07:09.219 
is the battery life is only 2.5 hours
but<00:07:07.639> what<00:07:08.210> you<00:07:08.389> would<00:07:08.509> want<00:07:08.720> to<00:07:08.870> do<00:07:09.020> with<00:07:09.199> that

but what you would want to do with that

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:10.930 
but what you would want to do with that
is<00:07:09.590> probably<00:07:10.039> just<00:07:10.220> carry<00:07:10.520> around<00:07:10.639> some

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:10.940
