flexibility<00:00:55.640> it's<00:00:56.210> what<00:00:56.330> we<00:00:56.420> want<00:00:56.570> the<00:00:56.660> desk

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:56.900 
flexibility it's what we want the desk

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.230 
flexibility it's what we want the desk
to<00:00:57.260> be<00:00:57.410> so<00:00:57.680> here's<00:00:57.890> a<00:00:58.070> new<00:00:58.280> technology<00:00:58.940> on<00:00:59.090> the

00:00:59.230 --> 00:00:59.240 
to be so here's a new technology on the

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.660 
to be so here's a new technology on the
OLED<00:00:59.690> display<00:01:00.410> buttons<00:01:00.830> what<00:01:01.220> we<00:01:01.280> can<00:01:01.430> do<00:01:01.520> now

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
OLED display buttons what we can do now

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.580 
OLED display buttons what we can do now
is<00:01:01.700> have<00:01:01.940> many<00:01:02.150> Miniclip<00:01:02.960> of<00:01:03.140> our<00:01:03.260> internal

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:03.590 
is have many Miniclip of our internal

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.890 
is have many Miniclip of our internal
clip<00:01:03.860> store<00:01:04.100> actually<00:01:04.460> present<00:01:04.820> images<00:01:05.089> to

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
clip store actually present images to

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.350 
clip store actually present images to
the<00:01:06.020> operator<00:01:06.520> at<00:01:07.520> the<00:01:07.640> macro<00:01:08.000> level

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
the operator at the macro level

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.560 
the operator at the macro level
this<00:01:08.720> is<00:01:08.869> good<00:01:09.049> for<00:01:09.580> animated<00:01:10.580> wipes<00:01:10.820> so<00:01:11.150> we

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
this is good for animated wipes so we

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.539 
this is good for animated wipes so we
know<00:01:11.720> exactly<00:01:11.960> what<00:01:12.409> we're<00:01:12.560> selecting<00:01:13.040> from

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
know exactly what we're selecting from

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:15.789 
know exactly what we're selecting from
the<00:01:13.640> clip<00:01:13.820> store<00:01:14.060> on<00:01:14.299> the<00:01:14.479> desk<00:01:14.689> level<00:01:14.900> another

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 
the clip store on the desk level another

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:17.109 
the clip store on the desk level another
new<00:01:15.920> technology<00:01:16.250> that<00:01:16.549> we've<00:01:16.790> done<00:01:16.939> is

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
new technology that we've done is

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:18.820 
new technology that we've done is
actually<00:01:17.240> bring<00:01:17.600> the<00:01:17.720> touch<00:01:17.930> screen<00:01:18.320> down

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
actually bring the touch screen down

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.520 
actually bring the touch screen down
onto<00:01:19.159> a<00:01:19.190> desk<00:01:19.460> level<00:01:19.820> now<00:01:20.210> today<00:01:20.960> as<00:01:21.170> se<00:01:21.350> was
