00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
today I'm going to show you how to do

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.370 
today I'm going to show you how to do
this<00:00:02.340> makeup<00:00:02.669> look<00:00:03.090> that's<00:00:03.419> overall<00:00:04.020> a<00:00:04.049> little

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
this makeup look that's overall a little

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.110 
this makeup look that's overall a little
brighter<00:00:04.740> than<00:00:05.040> what<00:00:05.160> I<00:00:05.220> would<00:00:05.339> normally<00:00:05.490> wear

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
brighter than what I would normally wear

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.030 
brighter than what I would normally wear
but<00:00:06.720> I<00:00:06.750> think<00:00:07.020> that<00:00:07.140> it's<00:00:07.290> good<00:00:07.500> for<00:00:07.529> spring

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
but I think that it's good for spring

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.040 
but I think that it's good for spring
especially<00:00:08.519> if<00:00:08.820> you<00:00:09.059> are<00:00:09.240> someone<00:00:09.599> who<00:00:09.630> likes

especially if you are someone who likes
to<00:00:10.260> wear<00:00:10.349> brighter<00:00:10.740> colors<00:00:11.160> for<00:00:11.400> spring<00:00:11.700> and

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
only topped it one time and that's all I

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.310 
only topped it one time and that's all I
needed<00:01:15.340> and<00:01:15.580> I<00:01:16.210> just<00:01:16.420> put<00:01:16.600> this<00:01:16.780> in<00:01:17.020> the<00:01:17.140> outer

needed and I just put this in the outer

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.710 
needed and I just put this in the outer
corner<00:01:17.890> and<00:01:18.100> I<00:01:18.220> had<00:01:18.250> to<00:01:18.550> blend<00:01:18.729> it<00:01:18.940> very<00:01:19.090> very

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
corner and I had to blend it very very

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.230 
corner and I had to blend it very very
well<00:01:19.960> because<00:01:20.770> it<00:01:21.130> was<00:01:21.280> so<00:01:21.610> dark<00:01:21.910> but

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
well because it was so dark but

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.670 
well because it was so dark but
eventually<00:01:23.110> I<00:01:23.140> got<00:01:23.500> it<00:01:23.680> all<00:01:23.920> blended<00:01:24.369> out<00:01:25.680> then

and<00:02:15.290> on<00:02:16.250> my<00:02:16.430> lips<00:02:16.640> I<00:02:16.940> used<00:02:17.209> one<00:02:17.390> of<00:02:17.420> my<00:02:17.540> favorite

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
and on my lips I used one of my favorite

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.830 
and on my lips I used one of my favorite
lipsticks<00:02:18.530> the<00:02:18.830> L'Oreal<00:02:19.459> infallible

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.720

just applied that to my lips and I think

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.089

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:30.880 
it matched all the pink colors nicely
