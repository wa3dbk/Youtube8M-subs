a rock what you have to do is get the

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.720 
a rock what you have to do is get the
tip<00:00:33.540> of<00:00:33.690> your<00:00:33.719> rod<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.230> that<00:00:34.829> lure<00:00:35.040> parallel

with<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.030> surface<00:00:36.390> of<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.600> water<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:37.140> bounce

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
with the surface of the water and bounce

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.920 
with the surface of the water and bounce
it<00:00:38.190> right<00:00:38.399> across<00:00:38.730> just<00:00:39.390> as<00:00:39.570> you<00:00:39.660> would<00:00:39.780> do

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
it right across just as you would do

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.660 
it right across just as you would do
with<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:40.110> rock<00:00:40.350> so<00:00:40.950> you<00:00:40.980> can<00:00:41.100> imagine<00:00:41.309> if<00:00:41.579> you

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
with a rock so you can imagine if you

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.280 
with a rock so you can imagine if you
took<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:42.000> rock<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:42.420> you<00:00:42.480> started<00:00:42.840> up<00:00:42.960> here<00:00:43.140> by

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
took the rock and you started up here by

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.020 
took the rock and you started up here by
your<00:00:43.469> head<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:44.129> you<00:00:44.219> throw<00:00:44.460> it<00:00:44.579> down<00:00:44.760> there's

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
your head and you throw it down there's

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.029 
your head and you throw it down there's
no<00:00:45.239> way<00:00:45.390> it's<00:00:45.539> going<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.780> bounce<00:00:45.899> if<00:00:46.500> you're

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
no way it's going to bounce if you're

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.250 
no way it's going to bounce if you're
trying<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.399> skip<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.760> bait<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.300> you<00:00:48.780> wind<00:00:49.110> up

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260

order to do this in order to get your

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.639 
order to do this in order to get your
tip<00:01:00.300> down<00:01:00.539> near<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.809> water<00:01:00.930> you're<00:01:01.350> going<00:01:01.500> to

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
tip down near the water you're going to

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.439 
tip down near the water you're going to
have<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:01.859> reel<00:01:02.070> up<00:01:02.309> until<00:01:03.120> you<00:01:03.210> don't<00:01:03.329> have

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
have to reel up until you don't have

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.750 
have to reel up until you don't have
very<00:01:03.600> much<00:01:03.960> line<00:01:04.260> outside<00:01:04.680> your<00:01:04.890> tip<00:01:05.070> now

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
very much line outside your tip now

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.700 
very much line outside your tip now
generally<00:01:06.270> I<00:01:06.299> keep<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.720> little<00:01:06.869> more<00:01:07.049> line<00:01:07.260> than

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
generally I keep a little more line than

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.649 
generally I keep a little more line than
this<00:01:07.830> outside<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.310> tip<00:01:08.640> if<00:01:09.150> I'm<00:01:09.360> making

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
this outside the tip if I'm making

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.630 
this outside the tip if I'm making
longer<00:01:09.869> casts<00:01:10.229> but<00:01:10.260> here<00:01:10.799> we're<00:01:11.369> really<00:01:11.490> not

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
longer casts but here we're really not

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.219 
longer casts but here we're really not
trying<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:12.000> make<00:01:12.150> super<00:01:12.510> long<00:01:12.720> cast<00:01:12.750> we're

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
trying to make super long cast we're

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.499 
trying to make super long cast we're
trying<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.530> make<00:01:13.680> short<00:01:14.030> accurate<00:01:15.030> casts

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
trying to make short accurate casts

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.480 
trying to make short accurate casts
let's<00:01:15.930> skip<00:01:16.229> across<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.710> surface<00:01:16.920> so<00:01:17.220> I<00:01:17.250> need

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
let's skip across the surface so I need

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.940 
let's skip across the surface so I need
to<00:01:17.610> reel<00:01:17.790> in<00:01:18.030> until<00:01:18.600> I<00:01:18.689> have<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:19.170> foot<00:01:19.650> or<00:01:19.770> less<00:01:19.799> a

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
to reel in until I have a foot or less a

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.370 
to reel in until I have a foot or less a
line<00:01:20.340> outside<00:01:20.580> my<00:01:20.939> tip<00:01:21.150> then<00:01:21.810> as<00:01:21.960> I<00:01:22.049> make<00:01:22.229> this

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
line outside my tip then as I make this

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.160 
line outside my tip then as I make this
cast<00:01:22.710> I'm<00:01:23.250> using<00:01:23.460> two<00:01:23.759> hands<00:01:24.210> I'm<00:01:24.689> keeping<00:01:25.080> the

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
cast I'm using two hands I'm keeping the

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.410 
cast I'm using two hands I'm keeping the
rod<00:01:25.350> tip<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:25.950> my<00:01:26.159> bait<00:01:26.340> pound<00:01:26.700> off<00:01:26.850> parallel

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
rod tip and my bait pound off parallel

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.660 
rod tip and my bait pound off parallel
to<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.689> ground<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.409> I'm<00:01:28.710> aiming<00:01:29.100> for<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.369> spot

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
to the ground and I'm aiming for a spot

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.929 
to the ground and I'm aiming for a spot
just<00:01:30.450> out<00:01:30.710> in<00:01:31.710> front<00:01:32.040> of<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.220> dock<00:01:32.430> so<00:01:32.909> it

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
just out in front of the dock so it

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.359 
just out in front of the dock so it
skips<00:01:33.270> across<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.840> surface<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:34.799> goes<00:01:35.130> up

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
skips across the surface and goes up

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.429 
skips across the surface and goes up
underneath<00:01:35.670> there<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.180> lot<00:01:36.570> of<00:01:36.689> times<00:01:36.900> as<00:01:37.200> soon

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
underneath there a lot of times as soon

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.080 
underneath there a lot of times as soon
as<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:37.650> thing<00:01:37.890> stops<00:01:38.220> it<00:01:38.400> begins<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.909> sink

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
as that thing stops it begins to sink

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
get that bail closed so you can set that

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.420 
get that bail closed so you can set that
hook<00:01:48.869> if<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.110> get<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.259> bite<00:01:49.500> so<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.280> have<00:01:50.369> a

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
hook if you get a bite so you have a

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.310 
hook if you get a bite so you have a
little<00:01:50.729> bridge<00:01:51.210> here<00:01:51.540> with<00:01:51.960> some<00:01:52.140> water

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
little bridge here with some water

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.920 
little bridge here with some water
underneath<00:01:52.619> it<00:01:52.920> try<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.520> show<00:01:53.790> you<00:01:53.850> what<00:01:54.780> this

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
underneath it try to show you what this

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.160 
underneath it try to show you what this
should<00:01:55.200> look<00:01:55.380> like<00:01:55.409> when<00:01:55.829> it<00:01:55.950> works<00:01:56.130> properly

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
should look like when it works properly

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.100 
should look like when it works properly
so<00:01:58.170> I<00:01:58.200> got<00:01:58.409> my<00:01:58.590> lure<00:01:59.009> reeled<00:01:59.310> up<00:01:59.719> I'm<00:02:00.719> gonna<00:02:00.869> aim

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
so I got my lure reeled up I'm gonna aim

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.700 
so I got my lure reeled up I'm gonna aim
just<00:02:01.500> outside<00:02:02.780> this<00:02:03.780> bridge<00:02:04.079> I'm<00:02:04.320> gonna<00:02:04.469> skip

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
just outside this bridge I'm gonna skip

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.800 
just outside this bridge I'm gonna skip
it<00:02:04.829> up<00:02:05.040> underneath<00:02:05.340> into<00:02:06.119> that<00:02:06.270> shadow<00:02:06.479> line

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
it up underneath into that shadow line

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.830 
it up underneath into that shadow line
back<00:02:07.049> there

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.940

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
sometimes you get one or two skips

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.590 
sometimes you get one or two skips
sometimes<00:02:13.700> you'll<00:02:13.880> get<00:02:14.000> a<00:02:14.060> whole<00:02:14.270> bunch<00:02:14.510> of

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
sometimes you'll get a whole bunch of

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.400 
sometimes you'll get a whole bunch of
them<00:02:16.330> you<00:02:17.330> can<00:02:17.480> see<00:02:17.660> it's<00:02:17.780> getting<00:02:17.930> well<00:02:18.260> up

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
them you can see it's getting well up

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.890 
them you can see it's getting well up
underneath<00:02:18.710> there<00:02:19.040> if<00:02:19.790> I<00:02:19.970> tried<00:02:20.270> to<00:02:20.300> do<00:02:20.540> a<00:02:20.570> cast

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
underneath there if I tried to do a cast

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.380 
underneath there if I tried to do a cast
where<00:02:21.200> ice<00:02:21.260> raised<00:02:22.160> my<00:02:22.370> hand<00:02:22.580> I<00:02:22.790> ride<00:02:23.090> up<00:02:23.120> over

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
little effort into this cast I'm just

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.610 
little effort into this cast I'm just
barely<00:02:38.240> flicking<00:02:38.810> the<00:02:38.900> tip<00:02:39.080> of<00:02:39.200> the<00:02:39.260> rod<00:02:41.620> skips

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620

makes them run over see what's going on
so<00:03:27.620> here's<00:03:27.980> a<00:03:28.040> technique<00:03:28.430> you<00:03:28.580> could<00:03:28.730> use<00:03:28.910> I

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:29.299 
so here's a technique you could use I

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:31.390 
so here's a technique you could use I
wanted<00:03:30.019> to<00:03:30.110> get<00:03:30.230> right<00:03:30.620> up<00:03:30.769> against<00:03:31.010> that<00:03:31.070> Bank

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
wanted to get right up against that Bank

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.220 
wanted to get right up against that Bank
right<00:03:31.940> up<00:03:32.030> against<00:03:32.299> those<00:03:32.450> really<00:03:32.750> bad<00:03:32.930> the

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
right up against those really bad the

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:34.260 
right up against those really bad the
little

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:34.270 
little

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.860 
little
piece<00:03:34.750> of<00:03:35.020> tree<00:03:35.650> there<00:03:36.180> I'm<00:03:37.180> gonna<00:03:37.330> skip<00:03:37.690> that

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
piece of tree there I'm gonna skip that

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:43.770 
piece of tree there I'm gonna skip that
bait<00:03:38.110> right<00:03:38.440> up<00:03:38.590> into<00:03:38.740> that<00:03:38.950> shoreline<00:03:39.220> I<00:03:42.780> put

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
bait right up into that shoreline I put

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.780 
bait right up into that shoreline I put
my<00:03:43.900> finger<00:03:44.230> on<00:03:44.260> the<00:03:44.380> line<00:03:44.650> just<00:03:45.400> when<00:03:45.670> it

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
my finger on the line just when it

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.180 
my finger on the line just when it
bounced<00:03:46.060> that<00:03:46.360> second<00:03:46.780> time<00:03:46.960> I<00:03:47.290> made<00:03:47.980> sure<00:03:48.160> it

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
bounced that second time I made sure it

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.010 
bounced that second time I made sure it
didn't<00:03:48.550> keep<00:03:48.700> on<00:03:48.910> bouncing<00:03:49.450> and<00:03:49.570> bouncing

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:50.020 
didn't keep on bouncing and bouncing

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.900 
didn't keep on bouncing and bouncing
skip<00:03:50.590> off<00:03:50.830> the<00:03:51.010> water<00:03:51.220> up<00:03:51.490> into<00:03:51.700> that

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
skip off the water up into that

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.810 
skip off the water up into that
vegetation<00:03:52.620> so<00:03:53.620> I<00:03:53.650> always<00:03:53.920> have<00:03:54.160> full<00:03:54.400> control

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:54.820 
vegetation so I always have full control

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.630 
vegetation so I always have full control
over<00:03:54.940> when<00:03:55.690> this<00:03:55.900> is<00:03:56.020> going<00:03:56.170> to<00:03:56.260> stop<00:03:56.550> and<00:03:57.550> I

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
over when this is going to stop and I

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.720 
over when this is going to stop and I
could<00:03:57.790> put<00:03:57.970> it<00:03:58.060> exactly<00:03:58.210> where<00:03:58.600> I<00:03:58.750> want

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
could put it exactly where I want

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.360 
could put it exactly where I want
skipped<00:04:00.730> right<00:04:01.000> up<00:04:01.150> into<00:04:01.330> that<00:04:01.480> shoreline

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
skipped right up into that shoreline

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:08.010 
skipped right up into that shoreline
instantly<00:04:04.410> I'm<00:04:05.410> flipping<00:04:05.830> that<00:04:05.980> bale<00:04:07.020> the

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:08.020 
instantly I'm flipping that bale the

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:13.690 
instantly I'm flipping that bale the
second<00:04:08.410> it<00:04:08.530> lands

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.110 

so<00:04:14.270> in<00:04:14.510> addition<00:04:14.660> the<00:04:15.020> docks<00:04:15.260> and<00:04:16.120> other

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
so in addition the docks and other

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.490 
so in addition the docks and other
structures<00:04:17.810> you<00:04:17.930> might<00:04:18.079> want<00:04:18.260> to<00:04:18.290> cast

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
structures you might want to cast

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.170 
structures you might want to cast
underneath<00:04:19.010> it<00:04:19.190> works<00:04:19.370> really<00:04:19.669> well<00:04:19.880> for

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
underneath it works really well for

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:21.659 
underneath it works really well for
casting<00:04:20.810> up<00:04:20.930> the<00:04:21.049> shorelines

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
casting up the shorelines

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:23.710 
casting up the shorelines
so<00:04:22.669> if<00:04:22.760> you're<00:04:22.850> fishing<00:04:23.120> around<00:04:23.180> some<00:04:23.480> kind<00:04:23.600> of

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
so if you're fishing around some kind of

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.270 
so if you're fishing around some kind of
structure<00:04:24.110> it's<00:04:24.260> good<00:04:24.410> for<00:04:24.620> trees<00:04:24.860> you<00:04:25.130> can

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
structure it's good for trees you can

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.610 
structure it's good for trees you can
use<00:04:25.430> it<00:04:25.550> for<00:04:25.639> skipping<00:04:25.910> up<00:04:26.120> into<00:04:26.419> lily<00:04:27.020> pads<00:04:27.320> if

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
use it for skipping up into lily pads if

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.290 
use it for skipping up into lily pads if
your<00:04:27.800> bass<00:04:28.010> guy<00:04:28.220> you<00:04:28.730> got<00:04:28.850> to<00:04:28.880> have<00:04:29.030> something

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
your bass guy you got to have something

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.450 
your bass guy you got to have something
that's<00:04:29.540> kind<00:04:29.660> of<00:04:29.810> small<00:04:30.080> and<00:04:30.290> light<00:04:30.470> big<00:04:31.220> heavy

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
that's kind of small and light big heavy

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:32.920 
that's kind of small and light big heavy
lures<00:04:31.820> just<00:04:32.120> aren't<00:04:32.300> going<00:04:32.419> to<00:04:32.480> skip<00:04:32.690> very

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
lures just aren't going to skip very

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.460 
lures just aren't going to skip very
well<00:04:33.139> but<00:04:34.040> I<00:04:34.280> use<00:04:34.630> 3-inch<00:04:35.630> paddle<00:04:35.990> tails<00:04:36.200> on<00:04:36.440> a

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
well but I use 3-inch paddle tails on a

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.670 
well but I use 3-inch paddle tails on a
jig<00:04:36.740> head<00:04:36.770> skip<00:04:37.190> really<00:04:37.520> well<00:04:38.320> you<00:04:39.320> can<00:04:39.470> even

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
jig head skip really well you can even

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.580 
jig head skip really well you can even
skip<00:04:39.889> some<00:04:40.100> of<00:04:40.130> the<00:04:40.280> bigger<00:04:40.520> plastics<00:04:41.330> but<00:04:42.320> not

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
skip some of the bigger plastics but not

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.110 
skip some of the bigger plastics but not
quite<00:04:42.830> as<00:04:42.950> good<00:04:43.130> so<00:04:43.550> if<00:04:43.610> you're<00:04:43.760> looking<00:04:43.970> for

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
quite as good so if you're looking for

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.490 
quite as good so if you're looking for
something<00:04:44.270> to<00:04:44.360> get<00:04:44.510> up<00:04:44.630> under<00:04:44.840> there<00:04:44.990> pick<00:04:45.470> a

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
something to get up under there pick a

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.500 
something to get up under there pick a
smaller<00:04:45.860> bait<00:04:46.100> something<00:04:47.000> that's<00:04:47.120> light<00:04:47.330> and

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
smaller bait something that's light and

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.330 
smaller bait something that's light and
that<00:04:47.600> will<00:04:47.750> skim<00:04:47.990> across<00:04:48.139> the<00:04:48.350> surface<00:04:48.530> and

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
that will skim across the surface and

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
that will skim across the surface and
you'll<00:04:49.460> find<00:04:49.729> you'll<00:04:49.910> be<00:04:49.970> catching<00:04:50.270> yourself
