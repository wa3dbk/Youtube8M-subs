00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:37.260 
that and that was it the Federation was

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.660 
that and that was it the Federation was
born<00:01:38.180> so<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.450> was<00:01:39.570> short-handed<00:01:39.930> I<00:01:40.590> think<00:01:41.580> they

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
born so it was short-handed I think they

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.780 
born so it was short-handed I think they
used<00:01:41.880> that<00:01:42.030> device<00:01:42.390> I<00:01:43.310> wasn't<00:01:44.310> as<00:01:44.400> upset<00:01:44.760> about

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
used that device I wasn't as upset about

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.100 
used that device I wasn't as upset about
it<00:01:45.030> as<00:01:45.180> I<00:01:45.330> think<00:01:46.160> Jonathan<00:01:47.160> and<00:01:47.869> marina<00:01:48.869> were

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
it as I think Jonathan and marina were

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.690 
it as I think Jonathan and marina were
but<00:01:50.060> again<00:01:51.060> it<00:01:51.300> wasn't<00:01:51.510> I<00:01:51.840> wasn't<00:01:52.140> asked<00:01:52.710> so<00:01:53.430> I

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700
