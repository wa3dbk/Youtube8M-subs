 welcome to the audible version of the 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.820
 endodontic notes this sound resource 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.850
 is a complement to the page of 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.220
 Internet that you have consulted was developed 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.080
 by doctor ricardo rivas muÃ±oz of the 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.689

 second unit morphology of the cavity 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.350
 thumb the topic that I am going to read is the one of 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.510
 the morphology of the lateral incisors 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.120
 superior lingual view in the 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.120
 X-ray will reveal curvature at peak 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.670
 distal of the pulp in 53% of the 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.820
 times and an axial average inclination of 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.580
 16 degrees of the tooth will not be visible 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.410
 in the radiography the presence of 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.080
 lingual shoulder where the camera and the 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.019

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.150

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.759
 Pulp is wider in dimension 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.310
 Palatine hall with a general shape 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:13.860
 ovoid at the level of the apical third the 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.930
 conduit is usually circular in shape 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.450
 curvature to lingual peak is not usually 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.480
 be observed on the radiography length

 gradual curve and bayonet in 6% 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.190
 Pulp chamber presents characteristics 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.920
 similar to the upper central incisor 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.200
 although with smaller dimensions without 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.570
 However, if the volume is taken into account 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.970
 total of the crowns of the central and 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.430
 Lateral the pulp chamber of the incisor 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:06.340
 lateral is proportionally much greater 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:09.100
 that the central incisor the conduit 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.050
 radicular although it is unique and conical and with 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.750
 configuration similar to that of the incisor 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.630
 upper central presents dimensions 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.120
 minors at the level of the apical third has 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.010
 tendency to curl towards distal being 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.110
 that many times that curvature is so 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.990
 pronounced that prevents the widening 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.730
 of the conduit clinical consequences of 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.160
 take to blame for a treatment 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.740
 favorable endodontic in the incisors 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.270
 upper laterals the contour of the 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.760
 pulp chamber of the lateral incisor 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.950
 superior is similar to the central one without 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.920
 However, it is smaller and can exist 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.650
 two pulp horns or none this 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.380
 tooth is wider in the hallway direction 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.480
 lingual that in the distal middle direction the 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.490
 cross section in the cement junction 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.800
 enamel shows a pulp chamber 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:56.950
 centered on the root and its shape can be 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:59.380
 triangular oval or round from the union 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.540
 enamel cement the pulp duct is 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.030
 makes round in its cross section 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:07.030
 in the middle and apical portions of the 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.130
 root there is usually only one conduit 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.440
 but cases have been published with two and 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.900
 three conduits this is all for now 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.240
 to see the illustrations on the subject 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:21.880

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.260
 is to continue forward move to the next
