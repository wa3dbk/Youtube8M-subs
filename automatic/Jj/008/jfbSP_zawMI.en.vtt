design<00:00:03.929> in<00:00:04.200> this<00:00:05.040> lesson<00:00:05.279> we're<00:00:05.580> going<00:00:05.670> to

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
design in this lesson we're going to

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.629 
design in this lesson we're going to
take<00:00:05.970> a<00:00:06.000> look<00:00:06.299> at<00:00:06.509> what<00:00:06.839> flat<00:00:07.259> design<00:00:07.770> is<00:00:08.040> and

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
take a look at what flat design is and

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.160 
take a look at what flat design is and
we're<00:00:09.120> going<00:00:09.240> to<00:00:09.269> take<00:00:09.420> a<00:00:09.480> look<00:00:09.719> at<00:00:09.840> a<00:00:09.870> few

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
examples of flat web design now flat

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.070 
examples of flat web design now flat
design<00:00:14.250> is<00:00:14.549> exactly<00:00:15.089> what<00:00:15.420> it<00:00:15.540> sounds<00:00:16.020> like

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
design is exactly what it sounds like

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.250 
design is exactly what it sounds like
it's<00:00:16.410> design<00:00:16.920> that's<00:00:17.190> intended<00:00:17.550> to<00:00:17.699> be

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:18.260 
it's design that's intended to be

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.599 
it's design that's intended to be
simplified<00:00:19.260> so<00:00:19.529> that<00:00:19.650> it<00:00:19.740> looks<00:00:19.949> flat

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
simplified so that it looks flat

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.439 
simplified so that it looks flat
there's<00:00:20.820> no<00:00:21.090> 3d<00:00:22.020> attributes<00:00:22.830> applied<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:24.000> any

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
of the graphic elements here there's no

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.630 
of the graphic elements here there's no
use<00:00:27.119> of<00:00:27.150> gradients<00:00:27.750> or<00:00:28.320> drop<00:00:28.769> shadows<00:00:29.340> or

now<00:00:31.800> in<00:00:32.040> some<00:00:32.430> examples<00:00:33.120> of<00:00:33.270> flat<00:00:33.450> design<00:00:33.750> you

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
now in some examples of flat design you

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.020 
now in some examples of flat design you
might<00:00:34.110> see<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:34.410> couple<00:00:34.710> of<00:00:34.950> gradients<00:00:35.610> here<00:00:35.910> and

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
might see a couple of gradients here and

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.900 
might see a couple of gradients here and
there<00:00:36.180> but<00:00:36.360> they're<00:00:36.510> used<00:00:36.750> very<00:00:37.290> sparingly

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 
there but they're used very sparingly

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.760 
there but they're used very sparingly
flat<00:00:38.910> design<00:00:39.239> for<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.540> most<00:00:39.750> part<00:00:40.110> consists

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
flat design for the most part consists

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.270 
flat design for the most part consists
of<00:00:40.950> big<00:00:41.280> bold<00:00:41.700> colors<00:00:42.329> bold<00:00:43.110> typography<00:00:44.100> and

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
of big bold colors bold typography and

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.910 
of big bold colors bold typography and
bold<00:00:44.879> shapes<00:00:45.420> sometimes<00:00:46.260> they<00:00:46.410> have<00:00:46.559> a<00:00:46.590> lot<00:00:46.770> of

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
bold shapes sometimes they have a lot of

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.670 
bold shapes sometimes they have a lot of
icons<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:47.760> go<00:00:48.059> with<00:00:48.270> them<00:00:48.480> so<00:00:49.110> for<00:00:49.289> our<00:00:49.410> first

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
icons that go with them so for our first

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.029 
icons that go with them so for our first
example<00:00:50.219> here<00:00:50.579> at<00:00:50.850> envato<00:00:51.390> com<00:00:52.079> we<00:00:52.739> see<00:00:53.010> a

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
example here at envato com we see a

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.810 
example here at envato com we see a
beautiful<00:00:53.910> flat<00:00:54.780> web<00:00:55.320> design<00:00:55.739> here<00:00:56.190> that

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
beautiful flat web design here that

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.720 
beautiful flat web design here that
brings<00:00:57.390> attention<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.440> content<00:00:59.010> so<00:00:59.609> we

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
brings attention to the content so we

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.029 
brings attention to the content so we
can<00:00:59.879> see<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.059> bold<00:01:00.510> logo<00:01:01.079> with<00:01:01.260> flat<00:01:01.590> colors

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
can see a bold logo with flat colors

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.609 
can see a bold logo with flat colors
again<00:01:02.399> there's<00:01:02.609> no<00:01:02.760> gradients<00:01:03.480> here<00:01:03.750> we<00:01:04.379> see

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
again there's no gradients here we see

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.789 
again there's no gradients here we see
bold<00:01:05.070> simple<00:01:05.580> navigation<00:01:06.409> each<00:01:07.409> of<00:01:07.680> the

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
bold simple navigation each of the

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.550 
bold simple navigation each of the
sections<00:01:08.310> of<00:01:08.490> this<00:01:08.640> page<00:01:08.700> have<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.659> bold<00:01:10.140> color

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
sections of this page have a bold color

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.100 
sections of this page have a bold color
for<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.070> background<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.970> everything<00:01:12.810> really

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
for a background and everything really

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.080 
for a background and everything really
stands<00:01:13.530> out<00:01:13.680> everything's<00:01:14.070> very<00:01:14.340> clean<00:01:14.490> it's

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
stands out everything's very clean it's

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.260 
stands out everything's very clean it's
almost<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.570> minimal<00:01:16.409> type<00:01:16.680> of<00:01:16.890> design<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:18.000> it

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
almost a minimal type of design and it

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.929 
almost a minimal type of design and it
looks<00:01:18.299> really<00:01:18.810> really<00:01:18.990> nice<00:01:19.380> another<00:01:20.340> example

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
looks really really nice another example

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.030 
looks really really nice another example
we<00:01:21.119> have<00:01:21.360> is<00:01:21.630> at<00:01:22.200> 2012<00:01:22.830> build<00:01:23.750> calm<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:25.140> as<00:01:25.890> we

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
we have is at 2012 build calm and as we

we have is at 2012 build calm and as we
scroll<00:01:26.310> down<00:01:26.340> again<00:01:26.759> obviously<00:01:27.420> we<00:01:27.509> can<00:01:27.630> see

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
scroll down again obviously we can see

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.710 
scroll down again obviously we can see
big<00:01:28.170> bold<00:01:28.560> red<00:01:29.369> colors<00:01:29.820> here<00:01:30.090> we<00:01:30.240> don't<00:01:30.420> see

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
big bold red colors here we don't see

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.260 
big bold red colors here we don't see
any<00:01:31.130> gradients<00:01:32.130> we<00:01:32.549> see<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.729> little<00:01:32.970> bit<00:01:33.210> of

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
any gradients we see a little bit of

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.569 
any gradients we see a little bit of
interest<00:01:34.049> up<00:01:34.229> here<00:01:34.439> at<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.650> top<00:01:34.890> with<00:01:35.250> these

interest up here at the top with these

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.330 
interest up here at the top with these
geometric<00:01:36.509> shapes<00:01:36.840> but<00:01:37.740> as<00:01:37.860> we<00:01:38.009> scroll<00:01:38.280> down

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
geometric shapes but as we scroll down

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.810 
geometric shapes but as we scroll down
we'll<00:01:38.759> see<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.630> use<00:01:39.810> of<00:01:39.840> big<00:01:40.259> bold<00:01:40.619> icons<00:01:41.400> on

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
we'll see the use of big bold icons on

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.069 
we'll see the use of big bold icons on
top<00:01:42.630> of<00:01:42.840> these<00:01:42.990> bold<00:01:43.500> geometric<00:01:44.040> shapes<00:01:45.079> and

it's<00:02:02.159> just<00:02:02.369> big<00:02:02.700> bold<00:02:03.180> colors<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.049> this

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
it's just big bold colors and this

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.620 
it's just big bold colors and this
website<00:02:04.860> doesn't<00:02:05.159> have<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.759> lot<00:02:05.969> of<00:02:06.000> clutter<00:02:06.360> on

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
website doesn't have a lot of clutter on

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:07.819 
website doesn't have a lot of clutter on
it<00:02:06.750> that's<00:02:06.899> one<00:02:07.079> thing<00:02:07.110> you'll<00:02:07.380> see<00:02:07.560> a<00:02:07.590> lot

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
it that's one thing you'll see a lot

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.650 
it that's one thing you'll see a lot
with<00:02:08.009> flat<00:02:08.310> design<00:02:08.700> is<00:02:08.910> there's<00:02:09.090> not<00:02:09.209> a<00:02:09.270> whole

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
with flat design is there's not a whole

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.800 
with flat design is there's not a whole
lot<00:02:09.690> of<00:02:09.989> text

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
lot of text

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.390 
lot of text
there's<00:02:11.080> text<00:02:11.500> where<00:02:11.650> there<00:02:11.800> needs<00:02:11.830> to<00:02:12.250> be

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
there's text where there needs to be

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.449 
there's text where there needs to be
text<00:02:12.940> but<00:02:13.600> there's<00:02:14.110> not<00:02:14.230> an<00:02:14.380> overabundance<00:02:14.950> of

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
text but there's not an overabundance of

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.520 
text but there's not an overabundance of
Information<00:02:16.180> crowding<00:02:16.780> the<00:02:16.900> page<00:02:17.140> so<00:02:17.410> it's

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
Information crowding the page so it's

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.400 
Information crowding the page so it's
just<00:02:17.620> a<00:02:17.770> nice<00:02:18.010> big<00:02:18.550> bold<00:02:19.060> clean<00:02:19.600> design<00:02:20.110> and

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
just a nice big bold clean design and

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.770 
just a nice big bold clean design and
the<00:02:21.190> final<00:02:21.520> example<00:02:21.819> I<00:02:21.970> want<00:02:22.150> to<00:02:22.209> look<00:02:22.390> at<00:02:22.600> and

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
the final example I want to look at and

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.420 
the final example I want to look at and
one<00:02:23.050> you<00:02:23.230> might<00:02:23.410> have<00:02:23.590> been<00:02:23.740> thinking<00:02:23.980> of<00:02:24.250> when

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
one you might have been thinking of when

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.220 
one you might have been thinking of when
we<00:02:24.550> started<00:02:24.610> talking<00:02:25.180> about<00:02:25.270> this<00:02:25.480> concept<00:02:26.020> of

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
we started talking about this concept of

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.530 
we started talking about this concept of
flat<00:02:26.470> design<00:02:26.830> is<00:02:27.010> the<00:02:27.610> Windows<00:02:28.030> website

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
flat design is the Windows website

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.229 
flat design is the Windows website
because<00:02:29.230> if<00:02:29.709> you've<00:02:29.890> used<00:02:30.069> Windows<00:02:30.550> 8<00:02:30.819> yet

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
because if you've used Windows 8 yet

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:33.960 
because if you've used Windows 8 yet
you've<00:02:31.780> seen<00:02:32.110> this<00:02:32.410> idea<00:02:32.950> of<00:02:33.220> big<00:02:33.550> bold

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
you've seen this idea of big bold

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.449 
you've seen this idea of big bold
background<00:02:34.780> colors<00:02:35.170> with<00:02:35.500> no<00:02:35.680> gradients<00:02:36.340> or

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
background colors with no gradients or

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:38.610 
background colors with no gradients or
anything<00:02:36.640> like<00:02:36.970> that<00:02:37.030> and<00:02:37.420> their<00:02:38.140> website<00:02:38.590> is

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
anything like that and their website is

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.890 
anything like that and their website is
the<00:02:38.890> same<00:02:39.130> as<00:02:39.430> you<00:02:39.550> can<00:02:39.700> see<00:02:39.910> their<00:02:40.120> logo<00:02:40.569> here

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
the same as you can see their logo here

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.170 
the same as you can see their logo here
is<00:02:41.020> much<00:02:41.950> simpler<00:02:42.430> than<00:02:42.610> it<00:02:42.730> used<00:02:42.910> to<00:02:43.000> be

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
is much simpler than it used to be

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.580 
is much simpler than it used to be
there's<00:02:43.420> not<00:02:43.540> as<00:02:43.630> much<00:02:43.780> color<00:02:44.110> in<00:02:44.320> it<00:02:44.470> it's

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
there's not as much color in it it's

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.949 
there's not as much color in it it's
just<00:02:44.739> one<00:02:44.890> flat<00:02:45.519> color<00:02:45.880> no<00:02:46.150> gradients<00:02:46.810> no

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
just one flat color no gradients no

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:48.870 
just one flat color no gradients no
bevels<00:02:47.380> no<00:02:47.620> shadows<00:02:48.160> or<00:02:48.400> anything<00:02:48.670> like<00:02:48.850> that

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
bevels no shadows or anything like that

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.259 
bevels no shadows or anything like that
and<00:02:49.269> as<00:02:49.870> we<00:02:50.019> scroll<00:02:50.260> down<00:02:50.320> again<00:02:50.950> we<00:02:51.190> see<00:02:51.519> these

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
and as we scroll down again we see these

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.060 
and as we scroll down again we see these
background<00:02:52.900> elements<00:02:53.410> that<00:02:53.500> are<00:02:53.620> just<00:02:53.769> big

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
background elements that are just big

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.030 
background elements that are just big
bold<00:02:54.459> flat<00:02:54.970> colors<00:02:55.480> and<00:02:55.750> that's<00:02:56.440> the<00:02:56.620> basic

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
bold flat colors and that's the basic

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.140 
bold flat colors and that's the basic
idea<00:02:57.190> behind<00:02:58.090> what<00:02:58.480> flat<00:02:59.260> design<00:02:59.739> is<00:03:00.100> so<00:03:00.760> as<00:03:00.910> we

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
idea behind what flat design is so as we

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.759 
idea behind what flat design is so as we
move<00:03:01.330> forward<00:03:01.690> we're<00:03:01.959> going<00:03:02.110> to<00:03:02.230> begin<00:03:02.530> to

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
move forward we're going to begin to

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:05.910 
move forward we're going to begin to
create<00:03:03.220> our<00:03:03.489> own<00:03:03.790> flat<00:03:04.510> web<00:03:04.810> design<00:03:05.170> using

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
create our own flat web design using

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.740 
create our own flat web design using
