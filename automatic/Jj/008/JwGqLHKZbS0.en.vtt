okay<00:00:37.440> so<00:00:37.500> first<00:00:37.890> we're<00:00:38.550> going<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:38.850> draw<00:00:39.239> the

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
paper if you plan on doing the ears like

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.139 
paper if you plan on doing the ears like
this<00:00:43.500> you<00:00:44.070> don't<00:00:44.430> have<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.640> worry<00:00:44.820> about<00:00:44.910> that

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
this you don't have to worry about that

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.040 
this you don't have to worry about that
just<00:00:45.450> do<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.570> head<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.379> arms<00:00:47.360> and<00:00:48.360> what<00:00:48.570> I<00:00:48.600> do<00:00:48.719> is

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
just do a head and arms and what I do is

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.650 
just do a head and arms and what I do is
draw<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.430> shape<00:00:50.670> I<00:00:50.820> want<00:00:51.000> my<00:00:51.090> animal<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.570> be

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
and then draw seam allowance around the

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.709 
and then draw seam allowance around the
outside<00:00:53.789> because<00:00:54.059> otherwise<00:00:54.989> it'll<00:00:55.260> be<00:00:55.350> tiny

00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:56.719 
outside because otherwise it'll be tiny

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:00.020 
outside because otherwise it'll be tiny
and<00:00:57.719> with<00:00:57.989> ones<00:00:58.170> like<00:00:58.379> this<00:00:58.590> you<00:00:59.070> can<00:00:59.340> leave

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
and with ones like this you can leave

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.000 
and with ones like this you can leave
porns<00:01:00.539> in<00:01:00.719> or<00:01:00.899> something<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.469> wings<00:01:01.680> the
