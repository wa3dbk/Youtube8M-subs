00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
after DEFCON 3 you can do this if you

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:27.600 
after DEFCON 3 you can do this if you
see<00:02:26.500> what<00:02:26.590> I<00:02:26.620> just<00:02:26.650> said<00:02:26.830> I've<00:02:26.950> launched<00:02:27.490> a

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
see what I just said I've launched a

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.400 
see what I just said I've launched a
fighter<00:02:27.880> yet<00:02:28.300> which<00:02:28.690> can<00:02:28.930> destroy<00:02:29.230> other

fighter jets and destroy things in the

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.890 
fighter jets and destroy things in the
sea<00:02:32.560> so<00:02:32.830> if<00:02:32.890> we<00:02:32.980> slow<00:02:33.190> it<00:02:33.220> down<00:02:33.360> or<00:02:34.360> watch<00:02:34.630> a<00:02:34.750> bit

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
sea so if we slow it down or watch a bit

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.720 
sea so if we slow it down or watch a bit
of<00:02:34.990> this<00:02:35.110> should<00:02:35.380> we<00:02:38.100> so<00:02:39.100> this<00:02:39.250> is<00:02:39.430> a<00:02:39.459> sea

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
of this should we so this is a sea

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.220 
of this should we so this is a sea
battle<00:02:40.150> and<00:02:40.480> I'm<00:02:40.540> turning<00:02:40.720> myself<00:02:40.930> into

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
battle and I'm turning myself into

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:48.180 
battle and I'm turning myself into
active<00:02:41.590> sonar<00:02:41.800> so<00:02:42.160> just<00:02:42.400> rather<00:02:43.200> see<00:02:45.810> ships<00:02:47.190> my

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
active sonar so just rather see ships my

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.250 
active sonar so just rather see ships my
ships<00:02:48.490> are<00:02:48.670> now<00:02:48.760> shooting<00:02:49.060> stealth<00:02:49.840> bombers

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
ships are now shooting stealth bombers

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.800 
ships are now shooting stealth bombers
that's<00:02:50.470> the<00:02:50.620> enemy<00:02:50.860> stealth<00:02:51.160> bombers<00:02:51.520> and

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
that's the enemy stealth bombers and

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.390 
that's the enemy stealth bombers and
they<00:02:52.810> haven't<00:02:52.959> their<00:02:53.470> battleships<00:02:54.100> as<00:02:54.280> you

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
they haven't their battleships as you

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.340 
they haven't their battleships as you
can<00:02:54.580> see<00:02:54.730> that<00:02:55.209> there<00:02:55.450> is<00:02:55.480> a<00:02:55.660> carrier<00:02:56.080> which

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
can see that there is a carrier which

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.410 
can see that there is a carrier which
carries<00:02:56.740> death<00:02:56.980> bombers<00:02:57.340> and<00:02:57.580> fighter<00:02:58.060> jets

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
carries death bombers and fighter jets

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.570 
carries death bombers and fighter jets
in<00:02:58.720> the<00:02:58.900> sea<00:02:59.080> I<00:02:59.290> could<00:02:59.890> have<00:02:59.980> had<00:03:00.100> them<00:03:00.250> but<00:03:00.430> in

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
in the sea I could have had them but in

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.009 
in the sea I could have had them but in
deploying<00:03:03.030> so<00:03:04.030> as<00:03:04.090> fast<00:03:04.330> forward<00:03:04.630> again<00:03:04.810> try

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
deploying so as fast forward again try

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:23.010 
deploying so as fast forward again try
and<00:03:05.140> get<00:03:05.230> to<00:03:05.320> DEFCON<00:03:05.530> 1

could be on it for about an hour and you
wouldn't<00:03:55.970> know<00:03:56.720> the<00:03:56.930> time<00:03:57.170> has<00:03:57.200> even<00:03:57.470> been

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
wouldn't know the time has even been

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.830 
wouldn't know the time has even been
passing<00:03:58.100> see<00:03:58.700> how<00:03:58.790> my<00:03:59.090> silo<00:03:59.390> that<00:03:59.510> has<00:03:59.720> just

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840
