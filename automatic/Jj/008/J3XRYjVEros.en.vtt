00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.460
 traditional bouquet of red roses was 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.260
 witness of the meeting we had with 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.060

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.510

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.850
 thanks to the doctors who rescued me 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.590
 the room of the comedian's house in 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.989
 puerto vallarta jalisco was where we 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.430
 we saw with a positive man despite 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:48.590
 the hard tests that life has 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.900
 put as the car accident 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.750
 seven years ago and of which currently 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.760
 suffers from the aftermath of an operation in 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:59.360
 spine put a plate 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:02.710
 and four screws and I have difficulties 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:06.260
 to walk always get used to 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:08.540
 to fend for myself I worked all my 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.230
 life from age 13 high and 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.230
 working 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:19.189
 and now to see it decreased me but also 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.799
 I understand that I am 80 years old and that 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:22.820
 gravity can not be equal everything always 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:25.040
 has it 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.180
 there must be stages 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:31.040
 and now I'm limited 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.540
 I do not bitter the time rubén aguirre 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.940
 he was interned he made a pact with 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.160
 roberto gómez bolaños we made a 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.560
 promise very difficult to meet to see us 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.880
 soon and I say difficult because he lives in 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.210
 cancún I live in puerto vallarta 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:47.240
 jalisco by ses is difficult 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.250
 but not like chespirito rubén 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.680
 aguirre has kept with love the costume of 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.229

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.770

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.859
 do not allow it god I'm already retired 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:05.259
 the fellow cinemas is still working is 

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:07.520
 because he is in need of money or some 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:10.950
 problem of having 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:14.900
 surely or they are accumulating money 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:18.630

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:21.360
 maría antonieta chemista is that this 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:24.690
 age keep working something happens with 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.960

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.960

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.389
 I get it 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.290
 look at Maria Celeste that when you 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.900
 ask rubén aguirre if you would think 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.610
 write a book about his life told me 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.890
 that he had not had not thought about it but 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.080
 that gave him an excellent idea because 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.690
 have you do not know the amount of things that 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.570

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.710
 of the trips he has made since 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.140
 good argentina has traveled all 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:02.050

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.970
 see what surprise we could have and in 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.590
 that sense who knows but I do not think 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.480
 I 'm interested in a book I see it resigned and 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.620
 above all optimistic towards the future 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.390
 enjoying every day that is what 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.430
 important especially after having 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.140
