take<00:02:20.810> my<00:02:21.810> flat<00:02:22.139> nose<00:02:22.409> and<00:02:22.650> this<00:02:22.799> time<00:02:23.129> instead

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
take my flat nose and this time instead

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.610 
take my flat nose and this time instead
of<00:02:23.700> going<00:02:24.180> flush<00:02:24.420> against<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:24.930> bead<00:02:25.230> I'm

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
of going flush against the bead I'm

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.099 
of going flush against the bead I'm
going<00:02:26.069> to<00:02:26.159> go<00:02:26.310> flush<00:02:26.639> against<00:02:27.180> 90<00:02:27.599> degrees

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:28.109 
going to go flush against 90 degrees

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:31.580 
going to go flush against 90 degrees
against<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.159> top<00:02:29.459> of<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:30.389> flat<00:02:30.659> nose<00:02:30.930> this<00:02:31.409> is

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
against the top of the flat nose this is

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.550 
against the top of the flat nose this is
going<00:02:31.739> to<00:02:31.829> give<00:02:32.099> me<00:02:32.129> some<00:02:32.459> area<00:02:32.909> here<00:02:33.540> to<00:02:34.349> be

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
going to give me some area here to be

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.360 
going to give me some area here to be
able<00:02:34.709> to<00:02:35.099> wrap<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.329> wire<00:02:36.709> to<00:02:37.709> give<00:02:37.950> it<00:02:38.099> some

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
able to wrap the wire to give it some

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.909 
able to wrap the wire to give it some
more<00:02:40.609> more<00:02:41.609> pattern<00:02:42.230> so<00:02:43.230> now<00:02:43.650> i'm<00:02:43.769> going<00:02:43.859> to

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:43.919 
more more pattern so now i'm going to

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:47.479 
more more pattern so now i'm going to
use<00:02:44.129> the<00:02:44.280> same<00:02:44.579> technique<00:02:45.180> to<00:02:46.069> make<00:02:47.069> the<00:02:47.280> loop

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
use the same technique to make the loop

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.690 
use the same technique to make the loop
i<00:02:47.760> go<00:02:47.909> over<00:02:47.939> the<00:02:48.299> top<00:02:48.540> of<00:02:48.810> the<00:02:49.530> first<00:02:50.040> prong<00:02:50.370> on

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
i go over the top of the first prong on

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.110 
i go over the top of the first prong on
the<00:02:51.510> round<00:02:51.719> nose<00:02:51.930> and<00:02:52.230> then<00:02:52.409> on<00:02:52.680> the<00:02:52.799> bottom<00:02:53.120> so

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
the round nose and then on the bottom so

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.909 
the round nose and then on the bottom so
i<00:02:54.150> end<00:02:54.389> up<00:02:54.569> with<00:02:54.629> this<00:02:55.349> loop<00:02:55.909> and<00:02:57.530> then<00:02:58.530> i'm

00:02:58.909 --> 00:02:58.919 
i end up with this loop and then i'm

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:05.119 
i end up with this loop and then i'm
going<00:02:59.099> to<00:02:59.189> take<00:03:00.109> my<00:03:01.109> flat<00:03:01.560> news<00:03:02.150> and<00:03:03.949> i'm<00:03:04.949> going

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:05.129 
going to take my flat news and i'm going

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:11.679 
going to take my flat news and i'm going
to<00:03:05.189> wrap<00:03:05.609> that<00:03:06.449> tail<00:03:07.730> all<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:09.060> way<00:03:09.180> around<00:03:10.219> and

00:03:11.679 --> 00:03:11.689 
to wrap that tail all the way around and

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:14.240 
to wrap that tail all the way around and
this<00:03:12.689> is<00:03:12.870> where<00:03:13.049> it's<00:03:13.169> very<00:03:13.230> helpful<00:03:13.859> to<00:03:14.069> have

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250

doesn't fly all over the place and then

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.830 
doesn't fly all over the place and then
cut<00:04:26.660> it<00:04:28.000> flush<00:04:29.000> now<00:04:29.240> you're<00:04:29.419> going<00:04:29.539> to<00:04:29.600> see

cut it flush now you're going to see

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.360 
cut it flush now you're going to see
that<00:04:30.020> there's<00:04:30.199> a<00:04:30.260> little<00:04:30.440> piece<00:04:30.680> sticking<00:04:31.070> out
