the head Rio with this new perception

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.139 
the head Rio with this new perception
actually<00:00:54.329> then<00:00:55.340> towards<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.399> back<00:00:56.670> end<00:00:56.969> of

the head for the rear taper there's one
color<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:01.170> then<00:01:01.320> as<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.559> gets<00:01:01.710> onto<00:01:01.920> the

running<00:01:02.460> line<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:03.420> color<00:01:03.600> changes<00:01:04.260> again<00:01:04.790> so

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
running line the color changes again so

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.960 
running line the color changes again so
we<00:01:05.909> have<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.299> green<00:01:06.780> front<00:01:07.200> taper<00:01:07.909> yellow<00:01:08.909> to

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
tell you you're onto the back taper and

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.690

a light gray running light I have to be

improved it this is slightly different
it's<00:03:02.640> a<00:03:02.730> little<00:03:02.760> bit<00:03:03.090> more<00:03:03.269> expensive<00:03:04.190> it<00:03:05.190> is

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
it's a little bit more expensive it is

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:08.560 
it's a little bit more expensive it is
definitely<00:03:06.269> an<00:03:06.420> easier<00:03:07.079> line<00:03:07.350> to<00:03:07.530> cast<00:03:07.769> with

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
definitely an easier line to cast with

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.289 
definitely an easier line to cast with
floats<00:03:09.570> quite<00:03:09.930> high<00:03:10.200> in<00:03:10.410> the<00:03:10.440> water<00:03:11.060> so<00:03:12.060> it<00:03:12.180> is

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
floats quite high in the water so it is

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.569 
floats quite high in the water so it is
a<00:03:12.329> good<00:03:12.600> line<00:03:12.810> it<00:03:13.350> picks<00:03:13.709> up<00:03:13.890> very<00:03:14.430> very

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
a good line it picks up very very

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:19.250 
a good line it picks up very very
cleanly<00:03:16.549> overall<00:03:17.549> I<00:03:17.850> have<00:03:18.209> to<00:03:18.360> say<00:03:18.600> I'd<00:03:18.900> give

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
cleanly overall I have to say I'd give

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.890 
cleanly overall I have to say I'd give
it<00:03:19.380> a<00:03:19.440> thumbs<00:03:19.650> up
