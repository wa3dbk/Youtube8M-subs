work done

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.310 
work done
we<00:00:09.780> finished<00:00:10.230> the<00:00:10.500> towers<00:00:10.980> and<00:00:11.250> the<00:00:11.309> Plymouth

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:12.320 
we finished the towers and the Plymouth

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.780 
we finished the towers and the Plymouth
now<00:00:13.320> we're<00:00:13.650> actually<00:00:13.769> going<00:00:14.099> to<00:00:14.160> get<00:00:14.309> started

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
now we're actually going to get started

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.330 
now we're actually going to get started
on<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.120> Taj<00:00:15.330> Mahal<00:00:15.360> building<00:00:16.199> itself<00:00:19.340> here

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
on the Taj Mahal building itself here

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.160 
on the Taj Mahal building itself here
you<00:00:20.430> can<00:00:20.580> see<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:20.850> detail<00:00:21.300> I<00:00:21.330> put<00:00:21.779> into<00:00:22.050> the

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
you can see the detail I put into the

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:29.750 
you can see the detail I put into the
walls<00:00:22.410> of<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.740> plinth<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:24.019> the<00:00:25.019> stairway<00:00:28.760> all

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
walls of the plinth and the stairway all

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.780 
walls of the plinth and the stairway all
right<00:00:30.240> so<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:30.720> begin<00:00:30.960> we<00:00:31.920> had<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.189> do<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.520> front

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
right so to begin we had to do the front

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.000 
right so to begin we had to do the front
door<00:00:33.120> I<00:00:33.450> mean<00:00:34.020> that's<00:00:34.260> usually<00:00:34.500> where<00:00:34.920> you

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
door I mean that's usually where you

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:35.510 
door I mean that's usually where you
start

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
start

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.750 
start
so<00:00:35.760> I<00:00:36.000> mapped<00:00:36.960> out<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.559> width<00:00:37.770> of<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.550> front

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
so I mapped out the width of the front

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.069 
so I mapped out the width of the front
door<00:00:40.640> going<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:41.730> little<00:00:42.000> bit<00:00:42.210> wider<00:00:42.600> than<00:00:42.780> I

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
door going a little bit wider than I

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.180 
door going a little bit wider than I
originally<00:00:43.980> planned<00:00:44.129> I<00:00:45.559> built<00:00:46.559> up<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:47.010> two

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
originally planned I built up the two

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:54.680 
originally planned I built up the two
columns<00:00:47.730> on<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.059> side<00:00:50.780> and<00:00:53.059> then<00:00:54.059> squared<00:00:54.539> it

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
columns on the side and then squared it

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:02.170 
columns on the side and then squared it
off<00:00:54.840> with<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.350> two<00:00:55.500> pillars<00:00:55.800> at<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.219> top

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.700 

I<00:01:02.650> then<00:01:03.650> began<00:01:03.890> to<00:01:04.460> fill<00:01:04.790> in<00:01:05.000> the<00:01:05.440> wall<00:01:06.440> that

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
I then began to fill in the wall that

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:13.330 
I then began to fill in the wall that
the<00:01:06.860> front<00:01:07.130> door<00:01:07.340> was<00:01:07.520> located<00:01:07.880> on<00:01:08.180> I<00:01:12.340> used

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
the front door was located on I used

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.780 
the front door was located on I used
sandstone<00:01:13.970> and<00:01:14.240> chiseled<00:01:14.630> sandstone<00:01:15.520> to<00:01:16.520> give

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
sandstone and chiseled sandstone to give

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:29.990 
sandstone and chiseled sandstone to give
the<00:01:17.030> wall<00:01:17.240> a<00:01:17.270> little<00:01:17.540> bit<00:01:17.690> of<00:01:17.930> variety

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.460 

I<00:01:31.310> toyed<00:01:32.310> around<00:01:32.340> with<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:32.940> few<00:01:33.240> ideas<00:01:33.420> with<00:01:34.320> the

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
I toyed around with a few ideas with the

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.050 
I toyed around with a few ideas with the
patterns<00:01:34.920> that<00:01:35.040> I<00:01:35.190> was<00:01:35.310> going<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.520> put<00:01:35.730> into

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
patterns that I was going to put into

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.950 
patterns that I was going to put into
the<00:01:36.240> wall<00:01:36.450> itself

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.700 

I<00:01:40.210> know<00:01:41.210> this<00:01:41.540> looks<00:01:41.750> a<00:01:41.869> little<00:01:41.990> phallic<00:01:42.350> but<00:01:42.680> I

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
I know this looks a little phallic but I

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.750 
I know this looks a little phallic but I
do<00:01:42.799> change<00:01:43.190> it<00:01:43.460> later<00:01:43.729> because<00:01:44.360> I<00:01:44.750> couldn't

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:45.760 
do change it later because I couldn't

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.830 
do change it later because I couldn't
get<00:01:46.760> myself<00:01:46.940> to<00:01:47.240> keep<00:01:47.510> that

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.140 

here's<00:01:51.380> one<00:01:51.650> of<00:01:51.680> the<00:01:51.799> columns<00:01:52.250> on<00:01:52.460> the<00:01:52.490> side<00:01:52.850> I

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.150 
here's one of the columns on the side I

00:01:53.150 --> 00:02:00.540 
here's one of the columns on the side I
did<00:01:53.780> it<00:01:53.869> on<00:01:54.080> both<00:01:54.320> sides<00:01:55.420> as<00:01:56.530> you<00:01:57.530> can<00:01:57.680> see<00:01:57.890> here

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.900 

I<00:02:00.610> also<00:02:01.240> use<00:02:01.510> some<00:02:01.860> quartz<00:02:02.860> steps<00:02:03.340> to<00:02:03.700> give<00:02:03.880> a

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:03.910 
I also use some quartz steps to give a

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.630 
I also use some quartz steps to give a
little<00:02:04.210> bit<00:02:04.450> of<00:02:04.720> depth<00:02:05.230> to<00:02:05.380> the<00:02:05.620> archway<00:02:06.610> on

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
little bit of depth to the archway on

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:13.900 
little bit of depth to the archway on
the<00:02:06.940> top<00:02:07.120> of<00:02:07.300> the<00:02:07.360> doorway

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.530 

and<00:02:14.450> now<00:02:14.570> for<00:02:14.810> the<00:02:14.900> two<00:02:15.170> arches<00:02:15.530> on<00:02:15.830> the<00:02:15.920> side<00:02:16.220> I

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
and now for the two arches on the side I

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.560 
and now for the two arches on the side I
use<00:02:17.540> chiseled<00:02:18.260> quartz<00:02:18.710> on<00:02:18.920> the<00:02:19.640> wall<00:02:19.850> backdrop

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
use chiseled quartz on the wall backdrop

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:25.330 
use chiseled quartz on the wall backdrop
and<00:02:20.840> sandstone<00:02:21.260> steps<00:02:21.830> as<00:02:22.100> ledges<00:02:23.060> I<00:02:24.340> then

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
and sandstone steps as ledges I then

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.280 
and sandstone steps as ledges I then
simply<00:02:25.790> copied<00:02:26.240> and<00:02:26.390> pasted<00:02:26.750> it<00:02:26.900> to<00:02:27.020> the<00:02:27.140> other

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
simply copied and pasted it to the other

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:39.040 
simply copied and pasted it to the other
side

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.580 

I<00:02:39.400> use<00:02:40.400> jungle<00:02:40.790> wood<00:02:41.120> steps<00:02:41.450> to<00:02:41.810> accent<00:02:42.350> the

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
I use jungle wood steps to accent the

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.190 
I use jungle wood steps to accent the
tops<00:02:42.860> of<00:02:43.070> the<00:02:43.160> towers<00:02:43.340> and<00:02:43.880> then<00:02:44.810> went<00:02:45.050> ahead

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
tops of the towers and then went ahead

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.940 
tops of the towers and then went ahead
and<00:02:45.440> started<00:02:45.950> filling<00:02:46.190> in<00:02:46.460> the<00:02:46.670> inner<00:02:46.850> walls

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
and started filling in the inner walls

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.070 
and started filling in the inner walls
of<00:02:48.950> the<00:02:49.340> Taj<00:02:49.550> Mahal<00:02:49.630> using<00:02:50.630> chiseled

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
of the Taj Mahal using chiseled

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:59.260 
of the Taj Mahal using chiseled
sandstone<00:02:51.650> I<00:02:56.920> use<00:02:57.920> some<00:02:58.100> quartz<00:02:58.460> steps<00:02:58.940> and

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
sandstone I use some quartz steps and

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:14.160 
sandstone I use some quartz steps and
pillars<00:03:00.170> to<00:03:00.410> give<00:03:00.590> it<00:03:00.710> a<00:03:00.800> little<00:03:00.920> bit<00:03:01.160> of<00:03:01.340> depth

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.440 

I<00:03:14.230> then<00:03:14.890> used<00:03:15.099> iron<00:03:15.490> bars<00:03:15.819> to<00:03:16.150> make<00:03:16.300> the

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
I then used iron bars to make the

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.230 
I then used iron bars to make the
doorways

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:21.240 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:27.280 

you

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.559 

I<00:03:27.349> did<00:03:28.099> some<00:03:28.340> on<00:03:28.430> the<00:03:28.549> side<00:03:28.790> there<00:03:29.090> to<00:03:29.269> give<00:03:29.420> the

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
I did some on the side there to give the

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:35.390 
I did some on the side there to give the
illusion<00:03:29.840> that<00:03:30.079> they<00:03:30.319> were<00:03:30.379> opening

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:45.699 

I<00:03:39.140> used<00:03:40.140> iron<00:03:40.500> doors<00:03:40.829> on<00:03:41.159> the<00:03:41.310> side<00:03:41.579> once<00:03:43.970> and

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
I used iron doors on the side once and

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:48.920 
I used iron doors on the side once and
then<00:03:46.709> filled<00:03:47.010> in<00:03:47.189> a<00:03:47.459> little<00:03:47.849> walkway<00:03:48.120> using

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
then filled in a little walkway using

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.280 
then filled in a little walkway using
oak<00:03:49.590> wood<00:03:50.209> here<00:03:51.209> you<00:03:51.329> can<00:03:51.480> see<00:03:51.659> that<00:03:51.870> all<00:03:52.049> lit

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
oak wood here you can see that all lit

00:03:52.290 --> 00:04:03.050 
oak wood here you can see that all lit
up<00:03:52.319> at<00:03:52.560> night

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.960 

I've<00:04:03.569> in<00:04:03.900> and<00:04:04.110> went<00:04:04.319> in<00:04:04.440> and<00:04:04.680> set<00:04:05.220> my<00:04:05.370> positions

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
I've in and went in and set my positions

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.590 
I've in and went in and set my positions
and<00:04:06.440> copied<00:04:07.670> rotated<00:04:08.670> and<00:04:08.850> pasted<00:04:09.390> this

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
and copied rotated and pasted this

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:24.390 
and copied rotated and pasted this
design<00:04:10.110> to<00:04:10.470> all<00:04:10.650> four<00:04:11.010> sides

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.540 

for<00:04:25.000> the<00:04:25.090> corner<00:04:25.510> arches<00:04:26.050> I<00:04:26.400> repeated<00:04:27.400> my

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
for the corner arches I repeated my

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.550 
for the corner arches I repeated my
design<00:04:27.970> for<00:04:28.600> the<00:04:28.750> most<00:04:28.960> part

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.559 

you<00:04:32.560> can<00:04:32.710> see<00:04:32.949> those<00:04:33.190> sandstone<00:04:33.759> step<00:04:34.090> ledges

00:04:34.559 --> 00:04:34.569 
you can see those sandstone step ledges

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:35.309 
you can see those sandstone step ledges
there

00:04:35.309 --> 00:04:35.319 
there

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:39.119 
there
I<00:04:36.120> think<00:04:37.120> cut<00:04:37.360> out<00:04:37.509> an<00:04:37.629> archway<00:04:37.960> backed<00:04:38.919> it

00:04:39.119 --> 00:04:39.129 
I think cut out an archway backed it

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:42.240 
I think cut out an archway backed it
with<00:04:39.280> chiseled<00:04:39.669> sandstone<00:04:40.240> and<00:04:41.069> carved<00:04:42.069> out<00:04:42.190> a

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
with chiseled sandstone and carved out a

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:47.870 
with chiseled sandstone and carved out a
doorway

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.050 

this<00:04:48.510> doorway<00:04:48.840> would<00:04:49.200> be<00:04:49.350> closed<00:04:49.710> and<00:04:50.040> I<00:04:50.760> just

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
this doorway would be closed and I just

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.350 
this doorway would be closed and I just
used<00:04:51.270> iron<00:04:51.630> bars<00:04:51.930> to<00:04:52.320> close<00:04:52.590> it<00:04:52.770> up<00:04:52.890> I<00:04:53.360> just

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
used iron bars to close it up I just

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.530 
used iron bars to close it up I just
repeated<00:04:54.720> that<00:04:54.840> on<00:04:55.170> the<00:04:55.320> bottom<00:04:55.650> half<00:04:55.860> and

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:56.540 
repeated that on the bottom half and

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:00.020 
repeated that on the bottom half and
again<00:04:57.540> copied<00:04:58.440> and<00:04:58.560> pasted<00:04:58.950> it<00:04:59.100> after<00:04:59.730> I<00:04:59.760> put

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
again copied and pasted it after I put

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.820 
again copied and pasted it after I put
in<00:05:00.150> some<00:05:00.390> oak<00:05:00.630> walkway<00:05:01.290> I<00:05:03.230> also<00:05:04.230> decided<00:05:04.710> to

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
in some oak walkway I also decided to

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.310 
in some oak walkway I also decided to
put<00:05:04.950> some<00:05:05.250> balconies<00:05:05.820> on<00:05:06.030> the<00:05:06.330> front<00:05:06.600> doors<00:05:06.900> on

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 
put some balconies on the front doors on

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:30.719 
put some balconies on the front doors on
the<00:05:07.650> top<00:05:07.890> layer

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:30.729 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:32.909 

and<00:05:30.819> that's<00:05:31.539> pretty<00:05:31.960> much<00:05:32.110> it<00:05:32.319> for<00:05:32.559> this

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:32.919 
and that's pretty much it for this

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:35.429 
and that's pretty much it for this
episode<00:05:33.129> we<00:05:33.669> did<00:05:33.789> all<00:05:34.059> of<00:05:34.089> the<00:05:34.360> walls<00:05:34.599> and<00:05:35.020> the
