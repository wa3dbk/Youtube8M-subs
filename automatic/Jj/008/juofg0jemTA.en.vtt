00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
the way it's supposed to be set up on

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.490 
the way it's supposed to be set up on
your<00:00:13.950> ports<00:00:14.280> okay<00:00:14.759> so<00:00:15.389> you're<00:00:15.509> gonna<00:00:15.570> f5<00:00:16.020> next

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
your ports okay so you're gonna f5 next

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.429 
your ports okay so you're gonna f5 next

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
backwards and change this unit if it's

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.970 
backwards and change this unit if it's
number<00:00:23.820> one<00:00:24.000> which<00:00:24.180> they<00:00:24.300> all<00:00:24.480> come<00:00:24.720> up<00:00:24.980> change

number one which they all come up change

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.320 
number one which they all come up change
this<00:00:26.250> reverse<00:00:26.640> it's<00:00:27.029> already<00:00:27.420> -<00:00:27.689> okay

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330

name it three four and then continue to

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.410 
name it three four and then continue to
add<00:00:36.540> your<00:00:36.840> boards<00:00:37.230> okay<00:00:37.670> if<00:00:38.670> you<00:00:39.000> need<00:00:39.300> to

status display but I'm not sure which a

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.439 
status display but I'm not sure which a
computer<00:01:01.260> yet<00:01:01.680> which<00:01:01.859> is<00:01:01.890> down<00:01:02.190> here<00:01:02.460> I'm<00:01:02.640> 15

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
computer yet which is down here I'm 15

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.830 
computer yet which is down here I'm 15
we'll<00:01:03.870> add<00:01:04.019> that<00:01:04.229> later<00:01:04.500> but<00:01:05.450> it's<00:01:06.450> adding

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
we'll add that later but it's adding

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.100 
we'll add that later but it's adding
this<00:01:06.960> system<00:01:07.860> others<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:09.030> IP<00:01:09.210> address<00:01:09.750> this

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
this system others the IP address this

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.800 
this system others the IP address this
is<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.320> dummy<00:01:10.619> right<00:01:11.159> they<00:01:11.430> all<00:01:11.549> have<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.850> be<00:01:11.880> one

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
is a dummy right they all have to be one

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.560 
is a dummy right they all have to be one
off<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:13.439> X<00:01:13.619> computer<00:01:14.189> default<00:01:15.180> gateway

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
off of that X computer default gateway

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.600 
off of that X computer default gateway
so<00:01:15.810> you<00:01:15.869> got<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.350> put<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.500> dummy<00:01:16.920> IP<00:01:17.310> address

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
so you got to put a dummy IP address

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.280 
so you got to put a dummy IP address
there<00:01:17.790> I<00:01:17.820> put<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.180> dummy<00:01:18.390> one<00:01:18.689> in<00:01:18.869> but<00:01:19.140> we're

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
there I put a dummy one in but we're

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.539 
there I put a dummy one in but we're
gonna<00:01:19.409> have<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.650> do<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:19.830> all<00:01:19.950> over<00:01:19.979> okay<00:01:20.340> we'll

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
gonna have to do it all over okay we'll

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.609 
gonna have to do it all over okay we'll
have<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.850> do<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.060> again<00:01:21.330> but<00:01:21.869> that<00:01:22.380> number

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
have to do it again but that number

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.310 
have to do it again but that number
can't<00:01:23.189> be<00:01:23.450> identical<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.630> other<00:01:24.869> YouTube

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
can't be identical to the other YouTube

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
can't be identical to the other YouTube
or<00:01:25.740> any<00:01:25.920> two<00:01:26.280> on<00:01:26.430> system<00:01:27.380> next<00:01:28.380> over<00:01:28.770> now<00:01:29.159> we're

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
or any two on system next over now we're

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.280 
or any two on system next over now we're
gonna<00:01:29.430> just<00:01:29.520> add<00:01:29.939> our<00:01:30.119> condensers<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:30.720> groups

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
gonna just add our condensers and groups

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.310 
gonna just add our condensers and groups
so<00:01:31.710> we<00:01:31.829> have<00:01:32.009> one<00:01:32.490> air<00:01:32.700> cool<00:01:32.939> one<00:01:33.240> condenser<00:01:33.840> to

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
so we have one air cool one condenser to

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.840 
so we have one air cool one condenser to
suction<00:01:34.590> group<00:01:34.950> suction<00:01:35.430> groups<00:01:35.579> in<00:01:35.729> this

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
suction group suction groups in this

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.100 
suction group suction groups in this
case<00:01:36.119> circuits

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
case circuits

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.480 
case circuits
I<00:01:37.140> don't<00:01:37.380> know<00:01:37.530> I'm<00:01:37.710> guessing<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:38.189> was<00:01:38.310> put

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
I don't know I'm guessing I was put

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.179 
I don't know I'm guessing I was put
twenty<00:01:38.820> okay<00:01:39.150> I<00:01:39.420> can<00:01:39.659> delete<00:01:39.900> as<00:01:40.140> I<00:01:40.259> go<00:01:40.470> right<00:01:40.890> I

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
twenty okay I can delete as I go right I

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.700 
twenty okay I can delete as I go right I
don't<00:01:42.090> have<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.360> nice<00:01:42.600> wet<00:01:42.810> space<00:01:43.170> controllers

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
don't have a nice wet space controllers

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.710 
don't have a nice wet space controllers
power<00:01:44.100> monitoring<00:01:44.610> but<00:01:44.880> I<00:01:45.090> will<00:01:45.450> create

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
power monitoring but I will create

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.590 
power monitoring but I will create
analog<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.860> digital<00:01:46.890> so<00:01:47.850> I'll<00:01:47.909> just<00:01:48.119> add<00:01:48.299> five

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
analog and digital so I'll just add five

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.060 
analog and digital so I'll just add five
for<00:01:48.930> now<00:01:49.049> bye<00:01:49.619> for<00:01:49.920> now
