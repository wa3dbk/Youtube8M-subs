00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:07.860
 The most casual taste and compact of the Land Rover lineup 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:13.200
 This free lander 2 with body 

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:15.080
 It is owner of size that is easy to be in Tokyo, but is off road 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.700
 Go to such a place 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:21.280
 From now on, check out the course and see what kind of run it will actually show 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:25.720
 to watch 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:29.260
 1 case It is this free lander 2 that looks like a city but still 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:34.540
 I feel Do Ya different in circulation that incorporate 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:35.140
 What is it like this unique driving position? Sitting in a high position 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.940
 I will 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.629
 By it 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:46.390
 You can see the condition of the surrounding road surface well 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:53.329
 It is really important to look at the road surface well when traveling off road 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:56.390
 But that means that it is well in this free lander 2 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:01:03.870
 Then we will go to mogul road 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:07.799
 Such a road surface is so tough that such tires can easily lift 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:11.000
 It Masu pretty Ike is not a this Freelander but I know the way 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.670
 It takes a firmly effort and Deployment 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.600
 This way 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.830
 Will 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:21.080
 Two more years now 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:23.690
 There but it idles 20 minutes for a moment 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:27.200
 For those who were successful 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:30.439
 I will apply the brakes to secure the traction. 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:34.130
 I am in front of a steep downhill 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:39.400
 Now turned on Hild Control 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:43.190
 This is so as not to go downhill at speed without stepping on the brakes 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:47.210
 It is a device that automatically controls the brakes 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:50.570
 I 'm completely off my break now 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:55.880
 I do n't want to see the speed up again 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:56.810
 I had a 25 degree driveway, but I got off slowly by controlling the mark brake 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.520
 It was 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:03.859
 Rest assured that this 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.859
 We will continue to get off even a slippery downhill 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:13.790
 It is such Novoli goods 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:19.100
 I'm climbing at 25 degrees, but for example , suppose that I stopped midway with this 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:24.800
 You have now stepped on the brakes and stopped even if you release the brakes when starting again 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:27.750
 It has a function to hold the pressure of the brake for a certain period gradient 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:33.240
 Even now though it is called the release control break 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:36.650
 I 'm off my feet and I 'm at a standstill, so I can smooth it by stepping on the cello that opens in the meantime 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:42.140
 It means that we can start 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:44.230
 I tried to challenge with pretty hard words but this freelander 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:49.959
 More than I thought 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:53.159
 It was a tough car but it looks like a city han but it was actually a land rover too 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.159
 It sounds like
