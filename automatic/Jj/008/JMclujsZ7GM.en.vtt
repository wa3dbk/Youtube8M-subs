pretty lot more and they're models and
skins<00:00:33.750> are<00:00:34.020> slightly<00:00:34.290> funny<00:00:34.530> in<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.710> moment

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
skins are slightly funny in the moment

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.410 
skins are slightly funny in the moment
but<00:00:35.130> I<00:00:35.190> know<00:00:35.280> they're<00:00:35.610> gonna<00:00:35.700> be<00:00:35.790> updated

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
but I know they're gonna be updated

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.389 
but I know they're gonna be updated
because<00:00:37.140> it's<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.410> really<00:00:37.680> recent<00:00:37.860> mod<00:00:40.399> and

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
because it's a really recent mod and

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.310 
because it's a really recent mod and
yeah<00:00:42.770> so<00:00:43.910> these<00:00:44.910> alligators<00:00:45.539> they<00:00:45.690> only<00:00:45.870> spawn

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
yeah so these alligators they only spawn

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.430 
yeah so these alligators they only spawn
in<00:00:46.530> this<00:00:46.649> swamp<00:00:46.980> swamp<00:00:47.550> swamp<00:00:48.270> biome

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
in this swamp swamp swamp biome

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.970 
in this swamp swamp swamp biome
which<00:00:50.219> is<00:00:50.430> where<00:00:50.820> I<00:00:50.850> am<00:00:51.030> now<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.949> they<00:00:52.949> just

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
which is where I am now and they just

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.000 
which is where I am now and they just
born<00:00:53.460> naturally<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.829> they

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
born naturally and they

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.210 
born naturally and they
you<00:00:57.100> do<00:00:57.699> damage<00:00:58.300> but<00:00:59.109> it

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:01.220 
you do damage but it

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.130 
you do damage but it
it's<00:01:01.490> quite<00:01:01.790> hard<00:01:02.000> to<00:01:02.180> take<00:01:02.360> damage<00:01:02.720> off<00:01:02.870> them

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
it's quite hard to take damage off them

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.380 
it's quite hard to take damage off them
so<00:01:03.950> if<00:01:04.129> she's<00:01:04.339> got<00:01:04.430> a<00:01:04.460> full<00:01:04.640> tooth<00:01:04.970> but<00:01:05.269> our

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
so if she's got a full tooth but our

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.020 
so if she's got a full tooth but our
because<00:01:06.580> your<00:01:07.580> health

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
because your health

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.550 
because your health
they<00:01:08.180> don't<00:01:08.360> really<00:01:08.510> damage<00:01:08.900> very<00:01:09.170> much<00:01:09.290> and

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
they don't really damage very much and

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.600 
they don't really damage very much and
or<00:01:10.280> die<00:01:10.460> yeah<00:01:10.760> I've<00:01:11.150> got<00:01:11.450> if<00:01:12.110> you<00:01:12.290> look<00:01:12.490> you<00:01:13.490> can

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
see all that meat on the floor but then

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.370 
see all that meat on the floor but then
you<00:01:16.700> can<00:01:16.850> see<00:01:17.090> I'm<00:01:17.270> actually<00:01:17.450> only<00:01:17.750> picking<00:01:18.140> up

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.130 
and so that identity that's a book
that's<00:01:27.259> on<00:01:27.560> my<00:01:28.280> side<00:01:28.640> or<00:01:28.970> whether<00:01:29.690> it's<00:01:29.869> caused

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
that's on my side or whether it's caused

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.530 
that's on my side or whether it's caused
by<00:01:30.350> the<00:01:30.530> natural<00:01:31.310> March<00:01:31.550> because<00:01:32.180> I<00:01:32.330> have

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
by the natural March because I have

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.359 
by the natural March because I have

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
quite a thin mugs on my minecraft so it

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:36.850 
quite a thin mugs on my minecraft so it
might<00:01:34.550> be<00:01:34.700> to<00:01:34.820> pick<00:01:34.970> a<00:01:35.000> banner<00:01:35.270> but<00:01:35.800> yeah<00:01:36.800> you

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
might be to pick a banner but yeah you

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.820 
might be to pick a banner but yeah you
can<00:01:37.130> they<00:01:37.790> drop<00:01:38.060> these<00:01:38.330> greens<00:01:39.110> meat<00:01:39.560> and

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.310 
can they drop these greens meat and
leather<00:01:40.729> some<00:01:41.240> reason<00:01:41.509> that<00:01:41.630> meets<00:01:41.930> already

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
leather some reason that meets already

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.090 
leather some reason that meets already
cuz<00:01:42.979> it's<00:01:43.160> cooked<00:01:43.550> which<00:01:44.090> I<00:01:44.619> don't<00:01:45.619> think<00:01:45.860> it

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
cuz it's cooked which I don't think it

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.790 
cuz it's cooked which I don't think it
should<00:01:46.310> be<00:01:46.450> but<00:01:47.450> I<00:01:47.750> don't<00:01:48.200> know<00:01:48.259> why<00:01:48.440> that<00:01:48.590> is

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
should be but I don't know why that is

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.630 
should be but I don't know why that is
or<00:01:49.130> maybe<00:01:49.340> I<00:01:49.479> misunderstood<00:01:50.890> but<00:01:51.890> and<00:01:52.130> then

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
or maybe I misunderstood but and then

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.840 
or maybe I misunderstood but and then
with<00:01:53.210> the<00:01:53.450> leather<00:01:53.660> you<00:01:53.930> can<00:01:54.110> make<00:01:54.320> well<00:01:54.850> it's

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
with the leather you can make well it's

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.310 
with the leather you can make well it's
pretty<00:01:56.090> obvious<00:01:56.450> where<00:01:56.630> you<00:01:56.690> can<00:01:56.840> make<00:01:57.020> that

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
pretty obvious where you can make that

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.050 
pretty obvious where you can make that
I've<00:01:57.740> spawned<00:01:58.130> some<00:01:58.399> more<00:01:58.610> into<00:01:58.880> this

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
I've spawned some more into this
