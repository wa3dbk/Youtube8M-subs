this<00:00:02.399> video<00:00:02.760> covers<00:00:03.090> the<00:00:03.319> removal<00:00:04.319> and

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
this video covers the removal and

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.020 
this video covers the removal and
replacement<00:00:05.600> of<00:00:06.600> your<00:00:06.839> fuel<00:00:07.109> injector<00:00:08.030> before

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
replacement of your fuel injector before

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.250 
replacement of your fuel injector before
you<00:00:09.120> can<00:00:09.240> do<00:00:09.330> that<00:00:09.480> you<00:00:09.660> must<00:00:09.870> remove<00:00:10.080> this

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
you can do that you must remove this

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.650 
you can do that you must remove this
high-pressure<00:00:10.620> fuel<00:00:10.980> line<00:00:11.250> from<00:00:11.490> your<00:00:12.360> fuel

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
high-pressure fuel line from your fuel

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:24.960 
high-pressure fuel line from your fuel
pump

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:24.970 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.429 

now<00:00:25.970> in<00:00:26.150> this<00:00:26.270> video<00:00:26.630> I've<00:00:26.840> done<00:00:26.869> this<00:00:27.170> in<00:00:27.349> the

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:27.439 
now in this video I've done this in the

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:28.330 
now in this video I've done this in the
reverse<00:00:27.590> order

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
reverse order

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.159 
reverse order
I'd<00:00:28.400> recommend<00:00:28.820> not<00:00:29.330> removing<00:00:29.869> these<00:00:29.990> two

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:30.169 
I'd recommend not removing these two

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:32.530 
I'd recommend not removing these two
bolts<00:00:30.500> first<00:00:30.770> like<00:00:31.039> I've<00:00:31.189> done<00:00:31.340> here

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:32.540 
bolts first like I've done here

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.720 
bolts first like I've done here
I<00:00:32.710> would<00:00:33.710> first<00:00:33.949> want<00:00:34.160> to<00:00:34.250> loosen<00:00:34.610> the

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
I would first want to loosen the

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.850 
I would first want to loosen the
high-pressure<00:00:35.090> fuel<00:00:35.420> line<00:00:35.720> right<00:00:36.410> below<00:00:36.710> it

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
high-pressure fuel line right below it

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.639 
high-pressure fuel line right below it
would<00:00:37.579> make<00:00:37.790> life<00:00:38.030> a<00:00:38.090> lot<00:00:38.210> easier<00:00:38.530> but<00:00:39.530> what

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:39.649 
would make life a lot easier but what

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:41.439 
would make life a lot easier but what
I've<00:00:39.770> done<00:00:39.920> here<00:00:40.129> is<00:00:40.280> we<00:00:40.400> remove<00:00:41.030> these<00:00:41.210> two

00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:41.449 
I've done here is we remove these two

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:45.700 
I've done here is we remove these two
bolts<00:00:41.780> on<00:00:41.839> top<00:00:42.019> of<00:00:42.199> the<00:00:42.260> engine<00:00:42.559> and<00:00:44.350> the<00:00:45.350> plate

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
bolts on top of the engine and the plate

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:59.000 
bolts on top of the engine and the plate
that<00:00:46.160> holds<00:00:46.430> down<00:00:46.670> the<00:00:47.540> fuel<00:00:47.809> injector

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.380 

so<00:01:00.010> if<00:01:00.129> you<00:01:00.250> do<00:01:00.370> it<00:01:00.460> in<00:01:00.519> reverse<00:01:00.670> order<00:01:01.059> like<00:01:01.269> I

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
so if you do it in reverse order like I

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.299 
so if you do it in reverse order like I
did<00:01:01.570> it<00:01:01.660> here<00:01:02.079> it's<00:01:02.500> a<00:01:02.589> little<00:01:02.769> hard<00:01:02.980> to<00:01:03.040> pull

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
did it here it's a little hard to pull

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.070 
did it here it's a little hard to pull
out<00:01:03.430> the<00:01:04.110> fuel<00:01:05.110> injector<00:01:05.610> because<00:01:06.610> the<00:01:06.729> lines

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
out the fuel injector because the lines

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.870 
out the fuel injector because the lines
too<00:01:08.080> tight<00:01:08.320> so<00:01:08.590> actually<00:01:09.369> what<00:01:09.460> I<00:01:09.490> did<00:01:09.580> here<00:01:09.850> is

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
too tight so actually what I did here is

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.340 
too tight so actually what I did here is
just<00:01:10.030> undid<00:01:10.450> it<00:01:10.509> pulled<00:01:10.930> it<00:01:11.020> out<00:01:11.080> of<00:01:11.200> the<00:01:11.259> way

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
just undid it pulled it out of the way

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:17.100 
just undid it pulled it out of the way
and<00:01:11.680> then<00:01:11.830> it<00:01:11.920> comes<00:01:12.100> out<00:01:12.250> easily<00:01:15.869> be<00:01:16.869> very

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
and then it comes out easily be very

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.170 
and then it comes out easily be very
careful<00:01:17.530> when<00:01:17.649> you<00:01:17.740> remove<00:01:17.830> it<00:01:18.180> sometimes

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
careful when you remove it sometimes

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.469 
careful when you remove it sometimes
what<00:01:19.720> can<00:01:19.780> be<00:01:19.930> left<00:01:20.080> behind<00:01:21.149> are<00:01:22.149> these<00:01:22.330> little

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
what can be left behind are these little

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.490 
what can be left behind are these little
copper<00:01:23.250> washers<00:01:24.250> very<00:01:24.820> important<00:01:25.410> there's<00:01:26.410> a

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
copper washers very important there's a

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.980 
copper washers very important there's a
few<00:01:26.679> of<00:01:26.740> them<00:01:26.770> and<00:01:27.280> you<00:01:27.399> can<00:01:27.550> easily<00:01:27.640> drop<00:01:28.000> one

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.800 

like<00:01:31.990> I<00:01:32.170> just<00:01:32.229> did<00:01:33.030> if<00:01:34.030> you<00:01:34.149> don't<00:01:34.330> notice<00:01:34.509> it

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
like I just did if you don't notice it

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.180 
like I just did if you don't notice it
we<00:01:35.470> cover<00:01:35.710> it<00:01:35.970> or<00:01:36.970> damage<00:01:37.330> it<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:38.710> distance

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
we cover it or damage it the distance

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.139 
we cover it or damage it the distance
that<00:01:39.460> the<00:01:39.610> fuel<00:01:39.850> injector<00:01:40.300> is<00:01:42.149> protruding

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:43.149 
that the fuel injector is protruding

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:45.389 
that the fuel injector is protruding
into<00:01:43.360> the<00:01:43.600> engine<00:01:43.960> will<00:01:44.710> make<00:01:44.890> a<00:01:44.920> huge

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 
into the engine will make a huge

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:47.820 
into the engine will make a huge
difference<00:01:45.610> in<00:01:46.300> how<00:01:46.330> your<00:01:46.569> generator<00:01:47.020> runs<00:01:47.259> in

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
difference in how your generator runs in

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.590 
difference in how your generator runs in
this<00:01:47.979> case<00:01:48.190> we<00:01:48.369> have<00:01:48.520> three<00:01:48.819> of<00:01:48.909> them<00:01:49.090> the

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
this case we have three of them the

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.559 
this case we have three of them the
factory<00:01:50.050> has<00:01:50.110> determined<00:01:50.649> what<00:01:51.569> the

00:01:52.559 --> 00:01:52.569 
factory has determined what the

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:53.999 
factory has determined what the
thickness<00:01:52.960> of<00:01:53.080> them<00:01:53.229> should<00:01:53.470> be<00:01:53.619> and<00:01:53.800> how<00:01:53.979> far

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
thickness of them should be and how far

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:56.070 
thickness of them should be and how far
the<00:01:54.490> fuel<00:01:54.700> injector<00:01:55.119> will<00:01:55.270> protrude<00:01:55.600> into<00:01:55.810> the

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
the fuel injector will protrude into the

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.230 
the fuel injector will protrude into the
engine<00:01:56.440> combustion<00:01:56.890> chamber<00:01:57.369> and<00:01:58.030> by<00:01:58.180> you

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
engine combustion chamber and by you

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.710 
engine combustion chamber and by you
losing<00:01:58.780> one<00:01:58.930> of<00:01:59.049> these

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.280 

and<00:02:02.500> not<00:02:02.680> replacing<00:02:03.100> them<00:02:03.370> afterwards<00:02:04.290> their

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
and not replacing them afterwards their

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:16.750 
and not replacing them afterwards their
generator<00:02:05.740> will<00:02:06.100> never<00:02:06.310> run<00:02:06.550> the<00:02:06.670> same

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.740 

there<00:02:17.760> is<00:02:17.850> another<00:02:18.090> line<00:02:18.330> on<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.480> fuel

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
there is another line on the fuel

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.390 
there is another line on the fuel

actually reconnecting it because I want

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.900 
actually reconnecting it because I want
