00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.770

c7<00:01:24.130> for<00:01:24.700> starters<00:01:28.500> yeah<00:01:29.500> probably

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.990 

yeah<00:01:49.350> so<00:01:49.530> it<00:01:49.650> had<00:01:49.860> netted<00:01:50.100> me<00:01:50.370> a<00:01:50.400> pawn<00:01:50.730> it

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
yeah so it had netted me a pawn it

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.490 
yeah so it had netted me a pawn it
wasn't<00:01:51.800> it<00:01:52.800> wasn't<00:01:53.190> him<00:01:53.870> gallic<00:01:54.870> blundering

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
wasn't it wasn't him gallic blundering

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.520 
wasn't it wasn't him gallic blundering
the<00:01:55.680> house<00:01:55.890> but<00:01:56.390> it's<00:01:57.390> still<00:01:57.630> nice<00:01:57.900> of<00:01:58.230> course

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
the house but it's still nice of course

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:06.790 
the house but it's still nice of course
yeah<00:01:59.250> I<00:01:59.310> guess<00:01:59.490> 94<00:02:02.660> cannot<00:02:03.660> be<00:02:03.810> really<00:02:04.080> bad

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.090 

okay<00:02:07.800> so<00:02:08.930> here<00:02:09.930> thought<00:02:10.260> night<00:02:10.500> at<00:02:10.710> five

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
okay so here thought night at five

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:27.500 
okay so here thought night at five
actually<00:02:11.700> but<00:02:25.250> oks<00:02:26.250> bishop<00:02:26.670> is<00:02:26.820> pretty<00:02:27.150> strong

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
actually but oks bishop is pretty strong

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.020 
actually but oks bishop is pretty strong
so<00:02:28.850> it's<00:02:29.850> not<00:02:30.200> not<00:02:31.200> a<00:02:31.310> not<00:02:32.310> a<00:02:32.340> very<00:02:32.610> clear-cut

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
so it's not not a not a very clear-cut

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:42.800 
so it's not not a not a very clear-cut
situation<00:02:33.960> actually

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:03:03.620 

that's<00:02:43.440> not<00:02:43.800> so<00:02:44.010> clear<00:02:45.950> surprisingly

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.420 

wonder<00:03:04.630> if<00:03:04.660> I<00:03:04.780> missed<00:03:05.080> something<00:03:05.230> there<00:03:05.680> so<00:03:06.280> it

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
wonder if I missed something there so it

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.940 
wonder if I missed something there so it
seems<00:03:06.670> very<00:03:06.760> likely<00:03:06.970> really<00:03:08.610> that<00:03:09.610> I<00:03:10.620> had<00:03:11.620> some

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
seems very likely really that I had some

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.040 
seems very likely really that I had some
opportunity<00:03:12.670> that<00:03:12.880> I<00:03:12.910> that<00:03:13.209> I<00:03:13.240> didn't<00:03:13.630> take

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:33.430

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:43.220 

using<00:03:34.440> the<00:03:34.590> active<00:03:35.160> night<00:03:39.230> yeah<00:03:40.230> Wow<00:03:41.960> no<00:03:42.960> sure
